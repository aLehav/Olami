The CMU Marauders, Carnegie Mellon’s Quidditch club team, has expanded and improved in its second year of play. The team traveled to a tournament in Virginia, has held workouts outside of practices, and consistently worked hard all year.
The team is currently 1–4 and plays the majority of its games at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Championships in Roanoke, Va. Season play also included a small tournament at Edinboro University.
The team’s first and only win of the season was at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Championships, in a game against the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.
“It was a very important win; it was definitely hard fought and well matched,” team captain Don Hood said. The team finished 15th out of the 19 teams in Virginia,  based on factors such as the amount of wins, number of losses, and point differentials.
The team plans on attending one or two more tournaments this year, which will help it in its expansion and development.
First-year Arley Schenker said that the team “improved a lot through the fall semester,” mentioning that the sport is “physically demanding.” 
Team practices, which occur once a week in the cold months and twice a week in warmer weather, are composed of drills and scrimmages, and are supplemented by occasional optional workouts.
“The Harry Potter [aspect] isn’t that big of a part of the team,” Schenker added. “It’s [the] actual athleticism that comes with it.”
Still, teams at the tournament in Virginia were served (nonalcoholic) butterbeer, and “someone’s jersey number is always 9 3/4,” Schenker said.
The team helped host the Harry Potter Theme Night at the Schatz Dining Room with CulinArt, an event that served as part of a broader campaign to increase the team’s visibility on campus. 
“[We] are in the workings [with CulinArt] of making an even larger version somewhere in the fall semester [and we] hope to host a Quidditch tournament in Pittsburgh,” Hood said.
Giving the team an on-campus presence is a major goal that Hood has for the squad. 
Hood said that he particularly wants to “increase the visibility of the team to the athletic demographics.... I want to get the word out that the team is a social group, but [it’s] also a sport.”
The team lost many veterans this past year, but a strong influx of new players helped to balance the loss. As the team attends more tournaments this year, and plans for increased visibility and fundraising, the sky is the limit for the Marauders.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track teams competed in the University Athletic Association (UAA) championships in Cleveland last weekend at Case Western Reserve University. The men placed first, winning the indoor UAA title for the first time in school history, while the women had an impressive fourth-place finish. “[We had] good performances on both the men’s and women’s sides. Our relays did really well, and we had some people on the podium, which is always good,” senior Carissa Iannone said.
On the women’s side, junior Samantha Oleson led the Tartans in the throwing events with a second-place finish and career-best toss of 13.43 meters in the weight toss, earning All-UAA honors. 
In the same event, junior Jane Kim also had her best career toss, 12.53 meters; and this effort earned her third place along with All-UAA distinction. The next day, Kim also recorded her career-best throw in the shot put, a distance of 10.44 meters. This finish gave her fifth place.
One Tartan, senior Emily Wobb, ran in the 5,000-meter event. She sped along to a time of 17:36.23, the best time in her career. Wobb also ran in the 3,000-meter event, earning sixth place with a time of 10:30.92.
Sasha Spalding, a sophomore, made the final round of the 200-meter race by beating her own school record with a new and improved time of 26.74; this score was then bested by Spalding herself in the final round. Her time of 26.61 gave her a fourth-place finish in the event.
On Saturday during the preliminary round of the 55-meter hurdles, junior Jacqueline Guevel sprinted to her season-best time, 8.44. In Sunday’s competition, Guevel had even more achievements: a second-place finish with a time of 8.47 and All-UAA honors. Guevel’s success also continued into the 400-meter race where she raced to her career-best time of 1:00.17, which earned her fifth place.
Finally, four Tartans — first-year Alexandra Lewis, sophomore Erin Kiekhaefer, Spalding, and Guevel — represented Carnegie Mellon in the 1,600-meter relay team event, finishing third with a time of 4:05.25. All four women were awarded All-UAA status.
On the men’s side, the team of juniors Kenneth Murphy and Josh Newby and sophomores Thomas Vandenberg and Douglas O’Connell collectively worked together to give Carnegie Mellon a UAA title with a season-best time of 10:16.08.  All four men were awarded All-UAA honors, as Newby and Vandenberg are second-time honorees after leading their team to a third-place finish last year.
Sunday’s weight toss event had three Carnegie Mellon athletes finish in top positions. Junior Zachary Erra-Hernandez was a huge asset for Carnegie Mellon’s throwing team, winning the shot put with a total of 15.48 meters. 
Junior Nathan Cheek and sophomore Gino Pilato also represented Carnegie Mellon well in this event — both earned All-UAA honors — and Cheek had his best career toss of 14.73 meters. Cheek earned All-UAA honors after throwing his weight 16.38 meters and earning second place in the event. 
Vandenberg earned yet another UAA title for the Tartans with his performance in the 800-meter run with a time of 1:57.89. Teammate O’Connell finished right behind him with a 1:59.10 time with UAA honors.
Newby’s third-place finish in the mile run also helped the Tartans’ success. Newby ran the mile in 4:21.88, his career best.
The meet was highlighted by several career bests, especially on the distance side. Sophomore George Degen’s time of 14:54.78 in the 5,000-meter run was his career best and a time that placed him second in the event. 
Distance runner Murphy competed in the 3,000-meter run and ran a personal record time of 8:39.89 to finish in third.
Sophomore Mike McDermott earned All-UAA honors in not one, but three events, receiving second place in the long jump and third place in the high jump. 
McDermott had a career-best event in the long jump, jumping a total of 6.44 meters.
He also cleared an impressive 1.89 meters in the high jump, earning All-UAA honors the second year in a row for this event. 
On Sunday’s event, the pole vault, he cleared 4.33 meters and finished in third place as a result. 
Senior Noel Titus competed well enough in the preliminaries in order to compete in the 55-meter dash on Sunday. His preliminary time of 6.53 seconds, his career-best time, allowed him to run in Sunday’s event and sprint to a time of 6.62 seconds, which earned him fourth place.
Finally, junior Mike Standish, O’Connell, Vandenberg, and Titus won the 4x400-meter relay with a blazing 3:23.68 time to give Carnegie Mellon its fourth UAA title of the day and finish off a successful meet.
Senior Ben Nealy said, “Everyone really peaked at the championships, and it was great to see everyone cheering for each other.”

After all of the hooplah of the Super Bowl nearly a month ago and the NBA All-Star game last week, it has been a very slow week in sports. Because of the dearth of sports-related news, sports news outlets have been trying to fill pages and air time. Since a viewer can only sit through so many terrible home videos of high school sporting events, the topic of choice for news agencies has been women in sports.
Now, this is not untimely given recent events. Professional NASCAR driver Danica Patrick, who is starting her first full season on NASCAR’s premier Sprint Cup Series, became the first woman ever to earn pole, or first, starting position. The fact that this race is the Daytona 500, the most prestigious race on the NASCAR schedule, has made the achievement all the more impressive.
Ronda Rousey, who won the bronze medal in judo in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, is headlining the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) 157 fight card, after UFC President Dana White said on tape that we would never see women fighting in the UFC.
This week also marked the announcement that, for the first time, a female player will attend one of the NFL’s regional scouting combines. Kicker Lauren Silberman, a former club soccer player at  University of Wisconsin-Madison and master’s student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is the first woman to try out for the NFL after the league changed its rules in 2012 to allow women to compete.
But each of these women has faced challenges and questions from both their competitors and the media that are holding them back.
Patrick has always had a large media following not because of her stature as a top female in a traditionally male-dominated sport (racing), but more because of her looks and personality. She has been featured in many of GoDaddy.com’s racy Super Bowl commercials and even participated in Sports Illustrated’s 2009 Swimsuit Issue.
As she enters this season, she has been plagued by questions about her relationship with fellow Sprint Cup Rookie Ricky Stenhouse Jr. After winning the pole position, she was asked about whether or not she would accept the traditional kiss from the scantily clad Sprint Cup Girl in the winner’s circle if she were to win. Who would she kiss and hug first: her boyfriend, her boss and racing teammate Tony Stewart, or some new mysterious stranger?
Rousey is flipping the mixed martial arts (MMA)  world on its head with her success. She has a 6–0 record with her last five fights ending in the first minute due to submissions. But she and her competitor Liz Carmouche, an ex-marine and recently-out lesbian, have faced many challenges. Many UFC fans have been attacking comments boards with discriminatory posts, and have shown disgust at the mere thought that women or members of the LGBT community should be allowed to fight, much less headline a fight card. These comments have ranged from attacking her appearance, her skill level, and women in general.
Now, to the UFC’s credit, it has used a much different marketing strategy when trying to expand the female presence in the sport. 
Unlike basketball, which has separate leagues for its male and female players (the NBA and WNBA), the UFC is making mixed-gender fight cards a standard concept. With each card being bought as a pay-per-view unit for over $50 depending on the cable provider, fans are forced to pay for these bouts whether they watch them or not.
Silberman is suffering from lack of publicity. While female kickers have not been uncommon in high school and even college football for well over a decade, it took until last year for the NFL to finally change its rules to allow a female player into its boys club. They have been content in riding the publicity of 9-year-old Internet sensation Sam Gordon, who as a girl dominated her Utah pee-wee football league. 
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell even made her a guest of honor at the Super Bowl, but Silberman and many other outstanding female players at much higher levels of competition have been ignored by the league.We like to think of ourselves as a progressive society with full gender and racial equality, but as these three women have shown, the media and the sports leagues themselves still treat them differently. 
Whether it is through media coverage, like Patrick; spectator hate and disapproval, like Rousey and Carmouche; or just ignorance and indifference, like Silberman; women still struggle to break down gender barriers. The media has a responsibility to cover women on a regular, consistent basis as they would any man who makes sports history — not as a novelty on slow news weeks.

First-year Abhishek Alla — known as “Shek” — although far from his home of Hyderabad, India, has served up a series of wins and greatly contributed to the undefeated Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team.
Most recently, Alla was named the University Athletic Association (UAA) Athlete of the Week for his performance the weekend of Feb. 16–17. Alla helped lead the Tartans to victory with his 2–0 dual-match record against some of the team’s toughest competition to keep the team at an unbeaten 6–0.
Alla posted a 2–0 mark in singles play. He started the weekend with a straight set victory at No. 3 singles, 6–1 over Matt Romei of Haverford College, and then turned in another straight set victory with a 6–4 win at No. 2 singles against Matthew Heinrich of the Stevens Institute of Technology.
“I think that, in addition to my 4.0 for the last semester, the last two matches have been the highlights of my college career so far,” Alla said.
The Tartans recently defeated big rivals such as Amherst College, which Alla said has been “[the] greatest accomplishment thus far this season.”
Alla is certainly no stranger to the sport of tennis, having played for 12 years. He values the traveling involved with the sport and the opportunity to “meet new people.”
Put simply, tennis for Alla “just feels good.”
“Abhishek’s game style is very unique and he understands tennis very well,” senior teammate Duke Miller said. “He is good at finding weaknesses in players and knowing how to use those weakness to win. Playing against Abhishek can be very confusing and frustrating for other tennis players.”
“Abhi has a very cool demeanor on the court. He doesn’t allow worries to get in the way of his abilities and naturally maintains a positive mindset, a trait that puts the whole team at ease,” sophomore teammate Bryce Beisswanger said.
Besides tennis, Alla enjoys watching movies and participating in activities sponsored by the Mayur South Asian Student Alliance, such as the recent MayurSASA dance show.
Of course, his civil engineering major keeps him busy with challenging coursework.
“Physics kicks my butt, and I plan to take Physics II at the [University of Pittsburgh] this summer,” he said. “Other than that, I can’t complain.”
Despite the adjustment to college life, Alla said that the “transition into college tennis has gone well.”
“The team has really been a big part of this adjustment. They’re just a funny group of characters,” he said.
His teammates feel the same way about Alla. “He is one of the most entertaining people on the team,” Miller said. “He is able to talk about school and tennis and doesn’t take anything too seriously. He always seems to be enjoying himself and having a good time as well, whether during matches, practice or workouts. He is good at speaking his mind and being very direct with people, which is often really funny.”
His antics are well known among the tennis team. “Abhishek thought it would be funny to pack a bag within another bag on our most recent trip to Philadelphia,” Miller said. “Everyone else was really confused, but he found it hysterical.”
“Shek always has a song in his head when he’s playing,” Beisswanger said. “Often a lot of players do the same but he surprised me in the fall when we played doubles together and following a missed shot he sounded of the chorus of ‘Don’t You Worry Child.’ ”
Alla emphasized the close-knit atmosphere of the tennis team, shown by their use of “meta-language.”
“I can’t even really describe the [meta-language],” Alla said. “It’s our own secret code.”
In addition to an enjoyable team atmosphere, Alla cites the proximity to family in the  Pittsburgh area as a favorite part of Carnegie Mellon, as well as another factor in helping him adjust to college life.
“It’s great to be able to get some delicious Indian food,” he said.
All settled in, Alla now sets his sights on his ambitions. “I want to be an All-American and compete at NCAAs.”
His teammates believe these goals are well within reach for Alla, whose fierce playing style and sense of humor continually surprise them. “He has a really funny style of playing so it’s hilarious when he starts playing and everyone is shocked. Abhishek is simply incredible,” first-year teammate Yuvraj Kumar said.

One of the greatest mysteries of our world is the accelerated expansion of the universe. If you threw a ball up in the air, you would expect it to fall back down because of gravity. For the same reason, one would expect that gravity would slow down the expansion of the universe. So what is making it speed up instead?
A well-known theory to explain this phenomenon involves a force called dark energy, which mysteriously repels gravity. While the existence of this force is generally accepted, no one has a solid understanding of what it actually is.
Carnegie Mellon assistant physics professors Shirley Ho and Rachel Mandelbaum have recently been selected to participate in the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Euclid mission, a survey that aims to uncover the secrets of dark energy and dark matter. Euclid will feature a 1.2-meter space telescope that will observe two billion galaxies in one-third of the sky. The portion of the sky that was chosen is currently being observed by various ground telescopes. Since space telescopes are very costly, Euclid will minimize its observations in space to complement data that is being taken from the ground.
“There are two ways that people like to make cosmological measurements,” explained Mandelbaum. “One way is to look at distance measurements and how they change with time. The other way is looking at the growth of cosmological structures with time.”
The first method — observing how distance measurements change directly with time — is related to Ho’s work with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). BAO are periodic fluctuations in the density of the baryonic matter (protons and neutrons) of the universe that are caused by sound waves from the early universe. The early universe consisted of a plasma made of electrons, protons, and neutrons that photons were unable to travel through; this trapping of photons created pressure differences in the density of the universe.
As the universe expanded and cooled, photons were able to move around freely, relieving the pressure from before and leaving behind a ripple of baryonic matter that can be observed in the present configuration of galaxies. “BAO only affect a small percent of the current universe,” Ho said. “Therefore, you need a very large volume of the universe before you can measure it.” With Euclid’s data, Ho will use BAO as a standard cosmological ruler — an astronomical structure — to determine how far away galaxies are, how they are accelerating away from us, and consequently, how the universe is expanding.
Mandelbaum’s research focuses more on the second method: She uses weak gravitational lensing to learn how matter in the universe clumps together due to gravity. “Gravitational lensing is the deflection of light by masses,” Mandelbaum said. “We can think of mass as something that causes distortion in space-time, so it changes the path that light will take.” 
For example, a galaxy that might actually be circular will appear elliptical in an image because the light from the galaxy is bent on its way to Earth. But how do we know if the image is being distorted by gravitational lensing or if that is simply the shape of the galaxy?
“For a given galaxy, you never know how much of the shape you’re seeing is due to lensing and how much is due to the intrinsic shape,” Mandelbaum said. “But here’s the important thing to keep in mind: If we didn’t have lensing and just looked at galaxy shapes, they would just be randomly oriented and not aligned with each other. But gravitational lensing causes shape distortions that are coherent across the sky, so you look for coherent patterns in the shapes and the random parts will just average out while the lensing distortions show up as the coherent patterns.” This can be done by averaging images from many, many galaxies — which is why data from Euclid will be so valuable.
The Euclid satellite will not be launched until 2020, but there are many preparations that Ho and Mandelbaum must make in the years to come. Trade-offs such as whether they should cover more area but look less at each point or cover a smaller area but look at each point longer must be considered. Sophisticated image processing algorithms will also be needed before collecting data.
Although it has been over a decade since we discovered that the universe was expanding at an accelerated rate, dark energy has remained a profound puzzle. The Euclid mission aims to explore the history of our universe’s expansion and to finally shed light on the mystery of dark energy.

“If you call the Poison Control Center and say: ‘I’ve eaten a poisonous plant, help me,’ they basically go through five volumes of books to figure out what you’ve eaten.”
These are the words of Marios Savvides, an associate research professor of electrical and computer engineering and the director of the CyLab Biometrics Center. Savvides and Cynthia Morton, the head of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s botany department, are developing a single digital database for identifying all poisonous plants. This database will aid in the treatment of hikers or passers-by who suffer from symptoms after coming in contact with poisonous plants.
The two researchers had known of each other before this project: Morton knew that Savvides had worked with facial recognition, so she wanted to apply that capability to a project involving plants. The result will be a smartphone app that that can identify a plant based on its appearance and provide the plant’s toxicity, symptoms that appear after contact, and remedies for treatment. From just a snapshot, the app will be able to detect anything from a weed on the side of a hiking trail to potted houseplants bought from Home Depot.
The benefits of the app are far-reaching. “It is beneficial for kids because there are common plants at home that can pose as health hazards for any kids or animals that swallow it,” Morton said. Additionally, the benefits of the app can be extended to the medical community.
The two scientists have collaborated with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) and the Poison Control Center, which currently use a medical toxicology book and the Micromedics database, UPMC’s medical database for poisonous plants. The current system is missing 60 percent of its database, including symptoms and images. Therefore, doctors are only able to recall information about each plant, but cannot immediately recognize a plant from a victim’s symptoms. This inefficient process of scrutinizing plant references delays the time required for optimal treatment.
From the medical toxicology books’ and Micromedic’s combined database, Morton and Savvides are able to mine out the 32 most commonly reported plants. As of right now, the app is only able to detect 10 of those plants, but the two are expanding the app database to allow it to recognize dangers beyond the 32.
“For many plants — some massive, some poisonous, or both — this is a good tracking mechanism to see what’s going on because a lot of these are not native to here. So, it’s giving us a wealth of information on a variety of different levels,” Morton said.
Soon the app will be able to detect the location of a poisonous plant and update the information on an online social networking system. Before advancement to the next step, the two scientists need to wait for UPMC’s approval on the proposal to fund the rest of the project. In addition, patients have also requested for the app to include certain poisonous mushrooms and hallucinogens.
So far, Morton concluded that the toughest part of the project involved hand collecting live specimens of the plants, organizing them by different colors and features, and taking 50 to 100 pictures of the same plant from different angles to help the app to recognize it.
Funding for the project came from the UPMC Healthcare Innovation Technology Grant program, which is a collaboration between Carnegie Mellon and UPMC. During the project, the two scientists also enjoyed learning more about the other’s specialization. Above all, they are proud to come up with a product that helps people.

When faced with a difficult decision, we often opt to give our minds a break, and take a fresh look at the problem afterward. However, recent research by Carnegie Mellon assistant professor of psychology J. David Creswell and alumnus James Bursley shows that we have been under a misconception about the way we approach decision-making.
Creswell and Bursley’s research shows that we unconsciously process decision-making information. Even while we are consciously distracted, the parts of the brain involved in decision-making — namely the visual and prefrontal cortices — are still active. The findings were published in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience.
Creswell, Bursley, and Ajay Satpute of Northeastern University performed a study on 27 adults. “In our study, we presented participants with four different items under different categories,” Bursley explained via email. 
The participants were presented with 12 attributes about the items in random order, and were informed that they had to make decisions about the quality of the items. As a control group, some people were asked to make decisions about each item’s quality immediately after being presented with the information. Others were distracted for two minutes before being asked to reach their decision. Those that underwent the two-minute distraction period were also subject to neuroimaging through an MRI scanner during the process. The images revealed that the prefrontal and visual cortices were active even though participants were not focused on making a decision.
“When people are initially learning information — say, about different cars — a set of brain regions is active and is carrying out this initial learning, which psychologists call ‘encoding,’ ” Bursley explained. “What we found is that some of the same brain regions reactivate — while people are performing the unrelated distracter task — in order to support continued unconscious processing of the initial information about cars.” 
The items were described to the participants such that there was one that was objectively the best, two that were of medium quality, and one that was objectively the worst. The results of the study showed that participants who made the decision after a two-minute distraction were better able to perceive this difference than those who made immediate decisions. 
“This isn’t so surprising,” Bursley said. “The distracter task allows time for additional cognitive processing to occur, even though this processing happens outside of conscious awareness and people have no idea it’s going on….It seems that this unconscious processing reorganizes and weight information, and this is probably part of what leads to people’s better decision making.”
Though the study made clear why decisions after unconscious processing were better than immediate decisions, it was not completely clear why unconscious processing was better than conscious processing. According to Bursley, one possibility was that conscious processing could make people mentally overwhelm themselves, and therefore make poorer decisions. “Whatever the reason, we see unconscious processing doing better than conscious thought,” he said. 
Bursley graduated in 2012 with a bachelor’s of science in psychology and a minor in philosophy. He began working with Creswell during his first year at Carnegie Mellon. Bursley assisted with data analysis and ran participants through experiments in Creswell’s lab. The two soon began exploring the possibility of using brain imaging to study unconscious processing in decision-making. “After a number of false starts, we eventually found an approach that worked, which is the one we describe in our current paper,” Bursley said. 
Since the same parts of the brain involved in decision-making are also involved in learning, Bursley and Creswell hope to investigate the role of unconscious processing in learning to see if it has a similar beneficial role. “We’re hoping to eventually apply our findings to real-world educational settings: We might be able to apply things we learn about how the brain unconsciously processes information to the classroom, leveraging our laboratory and neuroimaging research to help students learn better and improve educational outcomes,” Bursley said.

Fire: mankind’s greatest invention, or worst enemy? According to the U.S. Fire Administration, fire kills roughly 3,500 Americans each year and injures over 17,000 more. These numbers are higher than those resulting from any other force of nature. At the same time, it provides heat and is used to cook food needed for human survival, among countless other familiar benefits. Debates aside, one may ponder: How does this seemingly simple yet powerful phenomenon work?
Fire, put simply, is a conversion process. It takes some material (wood, paper, a cigarette) and rapidly converts it to simpler, lighter materials (carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, smoke). When set on fire, millions of carefully organized molecules that make up a piece of wood are broken down into a mess of smoke.
Three main ingredients go into making a fire: oxygen, heat, and fuel — the absence of just one of these makes fire’s existence impossible. Take, for example, a piece of paper as the fuel. An extremely hot piece of paper will not burn in outer space — there is no oxygen (all of those Star Wars special effects are scientifically inaccurate). The piece of paper won’t just erupt into flames sitting on your desk, either; there is not enough heat.
A seemingly silly but complex question then arises: Why does fire need heat? It turns out that oxygen, one of the three main ingredients in fire, is extremely stable; it will not react with anything unless it has enough energy to do so. Heat, then, is the supplier of energy to oxygen. Once enough energy is available, oxygen can start reacting with the fuel, igniting a flame and starting the fire.
One common way of creating the necessary heat is through friction. Take, for example, the striking of a match — the friction involved in this motion creates enough heat at the interface between the match and the matchbox so that oxygen can now begin reacting with the match head (the fuel), thus creating a flame. The flame from the match can then be used to transfer heat to another fuel to be set on fire.
Not all materials make good fuels, though. In general, materials that contain an abundance of carbon and hydrogen are flammable. The liquid fuel inside of a lighter is usually butane, which is entirely made up of carbon and hydrogen. On the flip side, water has plenty of hydrogen but zero carbon; there’s a reason firefighters love using it.
The flames of a fire confirm that a fuel has been set ablaze. The flames themselves are actually made of vapors and particles that are so hot that they light up — just as a filament inside an incandescent light bulb does. If the flame is colored yellow-orange, it is mostly made up of tiny soot particles and burns at about 1,800˚F. A bluish flame burns even hotter. In this case, the flame is blue because a hotter fire produces less soot (so, less yellow-orange) and more gas molecules, which tend to burn blue. As these particles and molecules get further away from the center of the flame, they cool down and cease to glow, creating an edge to the flame.
An extremely important characteristic of fire is that it is self-perpetuating. That is, fire creates its own heat to sustain itself. There is plenty of fuel around us, and certainly a lot of oxygen, but things aren’t spontaneously erupting into flames. This arguably makes heat the most important of the three ingredients. A strong source of heat is all it takes, so an action as simple as flicking a smoldering cigarette out a car window can easily ignite massive forest fires that destroy millions of acres of land.
Editor’s Note: Daniel Tkacik, a Ph.D. candidate in civil and environmental engineering, recently spent two months researching fire and smoke in the Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory in Missoula, Montana.

Calculations reveal finite universe life
Using the mass of the newly discovered Higgs boson, physicists are able to claim that the universe is unstable.
Joseph Lykken, a theoretical physicist with the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois, said, “A little bubble of what you might think of as an ‘alternative’ universe will appear somewhere and then it will expand out and destroy us.” Such an event is likely to unfold at the speed of light. However, Earth will be long gone before this catastrophe takes place. The sun is expected to burn out in approximately the next 4.5 billion years.

Tiny planet around similarly sized sun
NASA’s Kepler Mission has discovered a new planetary system containing the smallest planet orbiting a star similar to our sun. 
The planetary system, named Kepler-37, is 210 light-years away in the constellation Lyra, and consists of three planets orbiting a star that belongs to the same class as our sun. However, the star is slightly smaller and cooler.
The tiny planet, dubbed Kepler-37b, is rocky in composition, does not have an atmosphere, and probably cannot support life as we know it. It is smaller in size than Mercury and is only slightly larger than our moon, which made its detection a huge challenge

3-D printing to create a new ear
An artificial ear which looks, feels, and functions like a natural ear was created by Cornell University bioengineers and physicians using 3-D printing techniques and injectable gel molds. This is a much better option than reconstructive surgeries, which are painful or involve prosthetics that don’t feel natural. 
The first step is creating a digital 3-D image of the desired human ear and printing it out using a 3-D printer to make a mold. This mold is then injected with a high-density special collagen hydro-gel, which acts as a scaffold upon which cartilage cells can grow.
The entire ear can be grown in only a few days.

NASA confirms first drilled Mars rock
NASA’s Mars rover Curiosity has relayed images that confirm that it has successfully collected the first ever sample from the interior of a rock on another planet. On Feb. 8, the drill on Curiosity’s robotic arm took in the powder as it bored a two-and-a-half-inch hole into a target on Mars.
Transfer of the powdered rock sample into an open scoop was visible for the first time in images received from the rover last Wednesday. This confirmation represents a success for the sampling team involved with the mission. The rover team plans to have Curiosity sieve the sample and deliver portions to analytical instruments inside the rover

Tech companies hit by cyber attack
Microsoft was recently a victim of the same kind of Java-based cyber-attack that hit Apple, Facebook, and possibly Twitter earlier this year. Microsoft and Facebook maintain that no customer data was compromised.
Programmers within the targeted companies visited a website intended for mobile app developers, which had been hacked. This website then infected the computer through the web browser’s Java plugin and attempted to transmit data from the computer back to the hackers. Initially, the malware targeted only Macs, although a Windows PC version was also detected at some point.

Researchers stop flu from spreading
Stephen Withers and his colleagues at the University of British Columbia have recently found that a set of experimental drugs have treated the flu in the some mice. The drug candidates are part of a class of medications known as 2,3-difluorosialic acids (DFSAs) and work by blocking an enzyme binding process that is needed for the virus to spread from cell to cell. Mice treated with the DFSAs had as good of a recovery as mice who were given a currently available drug. The drug candidates also worked against drug-resistant strains of the flu.

Spring Awakening details the sexual blossoming of young teenagers in a repressive German community in the late 1800s. The musical, written by Steven Sater with music from Duncan Sheik, was based on a German play of the same name. Frank Wedekind originally wrote the play in 1891 in protest of the rigid social standards of the day.
Melchior Gabor, played by junior musical theatre major Taylor Jack Helmboldt, is a misunderstood young radical who longs to break out of his repressive school and reform society as a whole. He’s smart, and he’s more knowledgeable about sex than any of the other teens are. On the other hand, Wendla Bergman (senior musical theatre major Emily Koch) is a naive adolescent frustrated by her lack of knowledge about the world. Other central characters include Moritz Stiefel (senior musical theatre major Trevor McQueen), Melchior’s lovably anxious best friend, and Ilse (senior musical theatre major Olivia Harris), the students’ bohemian former friend.
The sets in the show were beautifully designed: Both the moving riverbank and the lights that stretched down from the ceiling created an ethereal feel to the stage. However, one of the more confusing aspects of the show was tied to these beautiful sets: Moritz’s repeated interaction with them. None of the other characters acknowledged the movement of the brook or the lights that stretched down from the ceiling. But at one point, Moritz backed away rapidly from the brook as if he could see it as it moved toward him, and at another, he deliberately swung the hanging lights.
The costuming choices for the show were interesting but more effective in some scenes than in others. Dressing grown women in little-girl frocks for most of the play was an excellent way to demonstrate the dichotomy between who the girls were becoming physically and who their parents and teachers said they must be. However, keeping them in those same short frocks for “The Song of Purple Summer,” the final song of the show, was confusing. Admittedly, the boys were running around in their underwear at that point, but the use of children’s dresses weakened the idea of growth in the finale. Were the girls still trapped in the infantile presentation that had governed their lives?
While on the subject of pants, having the bohemian runaway Ilse traipsing around the stage without them for most of the second act was a bit much. Her costume — thigh-high stockings, a man’s shirt, and a trailing scarf — was meant to convey her free-spiritedness to the audience, but it ended up being a little heavy-handed.
Like any play, this performance had its strengths and its weaknesses. This play was at its best when most of the cast was on stage. Individual performances could not match the frantic outpouring of energy displayed in “The Bitch of Living,” “My Junk,” and “Totally Fucked.” The voices of the cast blended well and created an absolutely phenomenal vitality on stage. While many of the individual vocalists were clearly talented, their voices sometimes failed to project over the instruments in the pit.
Despite this, many of the performers proved themselves excellent actors. The first act was definitely the weaker of the two in terms of performance, but the actors gained confidence in the second.
Both Koch and Helmboldt portrayed the dichotomy of children-turned-adults very well. This tension of confused adolescence is a major theme throughout the play, and the stars of the show communicated it admirably. They both demonstrated the growing sexual attraction between their characters well. Koch, in particular, succeeded in conveying both Wendla’s growing desires and her inability to understand them.
Two other talented cast members were senior acting major Katya Stepanov and senior acting and musical theatre double major Nick Rehberger. Together, they played all of the adults in the show. The adult characters in the show are written to appear as a uniform mass, but Stepanov and Rehberger managed to highlight the individual traits of each character. Stepanov’s contrasting portrayals of Wendla and Melchior’s mothers were both successful. Rehberger’s characters were more similar to each other — that’s just how the men are written in this show — but he infused each character with unique energy. His most frightening performance was that of the abusive father figure in “The Dark I Know Well.”
The show as a whole highlighted the idea of individual experience very well. Much of the choreography involved the actors running their hands over their own bodies, which emphasized both their feelings of isolation and their incredible yearning for touch from others.
Among the highlights of this show were the subtle directing choices that emphasized Spring Awakening’s central themes. One such choice appeared in the song “My Junk,” which describes the obsessive nature of teenage crushes. The cast clustered stage right, with all of the actors facing out into the audience. The girls giggled and waved as if looking directly at the boys, while the boys, positioned behind them, mugged and preened as if they were looking directly at the girls. This clever bit of directing highlighted the idea that teenage crushes are just as much about the admirer as they are about the object of admiration.
Overall, perhaps Spring Awakening was not the School of Drama’s best performance, but the actors were extremely talented and the presentation well thought-out. It was definitely time well spent.

With the Carnegie Mellon Town Hall meeting on sexual assault earlier this month and the recent Senate approval of an extension of the Violence Against Women Act, gender politics are at the forefront of society’s collective thoughts at the moment. This is certainly true for Carnegie Mellon students and members of the Pittsburgh community, who participated in yesterday’s MOSAIC Gender Conference: The Naked Truth.
MOSAIC is an annual gender conference that offers “provocative sessions aimed at exploring gender construction in unconventional ways,” according to the event’s website. This year’s sessions were led by Carnegie Mellon faculty, staff, and students. They covered a range of topics — from looking at Roe v. Wade 40 years later, to exploring the history of gay and lesbian social clubs in Pittsburgh in the 1960s, to analyzing the social construct of “man.”
The MOSAIC Gender Conference got off to an early start on Saturday evening with a performance of “A Memory, A Monologue, A Rant, and A Prayer: Writings to End Violence Against Women and Girls.” This collection of writings features monologues by well-known authors and playwrights and was edited by Eve Ensler (who also wrote the play The Vagina Monologues) and Mollie Doyle. On Saturday, five students presented monologues to a small audience, allowing for an intimate and meaningful evening. The audience was encouraged to give donations that benefitted the Women’s Center and Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh, a local shelter for victims of domestic violence.
Themes of domestic violence and assault continued throughout Sunday’s conference. The opening keynote speaker, documentary filmmaker and researcher Denice Evans, set the tone for the all-day conference with a talk titled “College Hook Up Culture: Understanding the Risks, Reasons, and Realities.” Evans’ keynote address included important and highly relevant topics for college students — alcohol abuse, legal consent for sex, and sexual assault — as well as video clips from her documentaries on college hookup culture.
Danielle Devine, a MOSAIC committee member and senior biology major, commented on the decision to bring Evans for this year’s keynote address: “We chose her because of the content, which I think was really good. It’s a college campus and we thought that would get a lot of people’s attention.”
Evans’ talk drew a fairly large crowd. Though it primarily dealt with male-female relationships and did not raise any issues that weren’t already prevalent on college campuses, it provided a pathway for open discussion on a campus where these topics are often overlooked. As Devine put it, “Even though the hookup culture isn’t super overwhelming at Carnegie Mellon, it’s still here.”
The breakout sessions throughout the day made up for the heteronormative focus of the keynote presentation, as they included topics like “From Daddy’s Debutante to Public Enemy Number One: What it Means to a be Black Transman” and “I’m (Not) Every Woman: Notes Toward a Queer, Feminist Critique of Drag.” The former talk was led by Michael David Battle, founder and director of Garden Peace Project and the director of prevention services at Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force. This discussion provided a look at Battle’s own transition from female to male and invited participants to explore their own privileges and biases. The latter presentation, led by local intermedia artist Dani Lamorte, presented a critique of femme drag and questioned prevailing ideas of drag as subversive.
Other sessions during the conference included “The House of Tilden: Gay and Lesbian Social Clubs of Pittsburgh (1960–1988),” a fascinating session led by Harrison Apple (a senior Bachelors of Humanities and Arts student in global studies and art) that provided an oral history of Lucky, a prominent figure in the emerging gay subculture of 1960s Pittsburgh. “The Social Construct of Man” session was led by Aaron George, Housefellow for the Intersection, and addressed issues of how men learn what is masculine and what happens when those ideals are questioned. Closing his session, George encouraged students to pay attention and be more aware of what is influencing them. As a way of overcoming social stereotypes, he told students to “call it out when you see it.”
MOSAIC concluded with a session led by Kate Hamilton and Kurt Sampsel, doctoral candidates in the English department, who discussed the importance of appearance and representation in gender relations, particularly in the media. Showing clips from Miss Representation and John Berger’s 1972 BBC series Ways of Seeing, the thought-provoking session allowed participants to engage contemporary media trends in an informed critique and was a fitting way to end the day.
The conference as a whole included sessions for a range of knowledge levels, with some sessions drawing on well-known theorists and others dealing mostly with individual perception. With growing attendance and a strong, open community present, this year’s MOSAIC gender conference proved to be quite successful at engaging students in conversations about gender, sex, and sexuality that they otherwise might not have had.

In an exciting display of artistic exploration, the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama presented Gertrude Stein’s renowned contemporary opera Four Saints in Three Acts, which will run through this week after opening last Wednesday in the Helen Wayne Rauh Studio Theatre in the Purnell Center for the Arts.
As part of the School of Drama’s Director Series, Four Saints was placed under the direction of Michelle Sutherland, who workshopped the production over the summer at the Florida State Performance Kitchen. Sutherland, a graduate of Stanford University, is currently a John Wells Fellow at Carnegie Mellon, where she is pursuing an MFA in stage direction. In a production such as Four Saints, direction is extremely important, and Sutherland did not disappoint.
The show is largely abstract, but is divided into various “acts” or sections. Throughout the show, the actors mention a variety of saints and communicate through short, repeated sung lines of text.
The set was a minimalistic white stage with a few triangular points rising from the ground to elicit what seemed to be staggered mountain tops. Costumes varied throughout the performance. Each of the actors began with the same look: barefoot with slacks and a blazer. At different points, some of the actors changed into bathrobes or speedos.
The lighting was also unique: They shifted in both color and intensity to represent the different emotional states of the characters, thus enhancing the set and the performances of the actors.
In order to fully appreciate the amount of detail in the School of Drama’s production, it is important to grasp the concept of this masterpiece. Written by Stein and composed by Virgil Thomson in 1927, Four Saints in Three Acts was meant to be a purely American work of art. Although it was certainly groundbreaking in terms of artistic exploration and performance, the premiere fell short of its goal to fully realize the American style of art —  probably due to Thomson’s employment of the European operatic style of singing. This shortcoming seemed to be the basis on which Carnegie Mellon decided to produce a purely American, stylized opera.
The entire work was a collage of American musical genres and dance styles. From an interdisciplinary perspective, Carnegie Mellon’s production thrived. Not only were the actors required to sing a cappella throughout the entire performance — they were also tasked with performing exciting dance routines, exhibiting various states of emotion, and creating percussion to complement the vocal lines.
Interestingly enough, Sutherland made the decision to leave the creative aspects of the performance up to the actors. For instance, according to the program, the actors created the music and choreography during the rehearsal process. This extraordinary accomplishment is a true testament to the talent of Carnegie Mellon drama students.
The production featured seven male actors, all of whom were extremely successful in setting Stein’s text to music. Standout performances by the cast included those of junior musical theatre majors Mitch Marois, who showed off his skills as dancer, and Daniel Bellomy, whose beautiful voice rang throughout the theater. Junior acting major Jordan Phillips gave a truly wonderful performance, demonstrating his impressive vocal range and his expressive talent as a dancer. Phillips commanded the stage with his marvelously high falsetto.
For the most part, each song was of a different American musical genre and featured a different actor as the soloist. Not only were the solo lines interesting, but the harmonies and percussion also seemed to fit perfectly. The musical aspects of the show were reminiscent of STOMP, with each actor creating complementary noises with either his voice, his hands, his feet, a prop, or a combination of these elements. In addition, the American styles of movement created an engaging scene to watch.
In all, Carnegie Mellon’s production of Four Saints in Three Acts was a grand success. Stein’s libretto is abstract and calls for a great deal of artistic exploration. Furthermore, Sutherland’s interpretation did not disappoint: The performance was a wonderful vehicle of artistic expression. Though intrinsically abstract, the production realized Stein’s intentions by creating a truly American performance.

The exhibit Oh Snap! Your Take on Our Photographs, which launched at the Carnegie Museum of Art (CMOA) last Thursday, is based on 13 photographs that have recently been added to the museum’s collection. Described as a “collaborative photography project” by the CMOA website, Oh Snap! is a reflection of the museum’s efforts to increase public interest in photography by inspiring people to take pictures and share them.
As part of the exhibit, visitors are invited to submit photos that connect to one of the 13 pieces. Anyone who visited the exhibit the day after its opening would have seen the already-abundant response. Set in a large, open space just across from the entrance to the museum, the exhibit features several small “response” photographs arranged around the original inspiration photo. The space also leaves plenty of room on the walls for photographs to come; it will be interesting to see if the exhibit eventually receives enough photos to completely cover them.
Although there are plenty of photos lining the entrance, the piece that immediately captures one’s attention is a sequence of photographs titled “The Bogeyman” by Duane Michals. As one would expect from a sequence, each photo is a continuation of the previous one, visually telling the story of a little girl being carried away by a figure, initially pictured as clothes hanging on a coat rack, that suddenly becomes animated despite keeping the same appearance.
The only sequence of photographs in the exhibit, “The Bogeyman” is unique; looking through this collection is somewhat like watching a movie. The advantage of a sequence of photographs is the opportunity to go back to the picture where the girl confirms that there is nothing on the coat rack, and to then compare it to when the clothes materialize into a figure.
Michals’ collection of photos is surrounded by several other eerie black-and-white images submitted by visitors. The connection to the theme is certainly existent, even though each photograph has the ability to tell its own story.
“Space Ship” by Chris Shaw is another photograph that sparked a memorable collection of images. Interestingly, Shaw is best known for a set of photographs that were taken over his 10 years working the night shift at a hotel, which he suitably titled “Life as a Night Porter.” 
The image itself is just a revolving door, but like many others in this collection, at first it does not appear to be what it actually is. As indicated by its name, the revolving door is pictured in such a way that it does look like a spaceship at first glance. The majority of the images inspired by “Space Ship” consist of buildings and scenery photographed at unique angles or in distinct lighting that emphasize aspects one would normally overlook. An object as common as an escalator, for example, can appear strange and futuristic when pictured in black and white at an angle that makes it look endless, as seen in the response photographs to “Space Ship.”
“Space Ship” and “The Bogeyman” inspired only two of 13 collections featured in the Oh Snap! exhibit.  While each collection is distinct, the entire exhibit is connected by the observation that all of the images taken are of daily life; they feature everyday objects and ideas to which visitors can relate. Many photographs feature people, including one collection that focuses on the effect that humans have on the landscape, a response to the inspirational piece “Rollerblades, Bonneville Salt Flats” by Richard Misrach. Another collection examines hair in response to the piece “Mkpuk Eba HD 694/74” by J. D. ‘Okhai Ojeikere.
The current themes of the collections may change as others submit more photos, making this ever-changing exhibit all the more interesting. Each photo represents a distinct background, a unique story, or a different lifestyle, making people and their everyday lives the central theme of the Oh Snap! exhibit.

Antichamber is weird. Most reviews use words such as “non-Euclidean” and “Escher-like” to describe it. Watching the trailer evokes memories of Portal, but with the brightness and contrast turned way up, and the portal gun replaced with a different, slightly more colorful sidearm.
After the nearly two-minute-long trailer, confusion sets in. Nothing seems to make sense. Floors disappear and reappear, walls appear where there were none, and staircases lead back to the entrance of the same room — all while you are running through stark-white corridors. It looks challenging, and not solely because the game appears to make no physical sense. It also challenges the player psychologically, urging them in ways one might normally expect and — more often than not — in ways many would never believe possible.
To quote Venture Beat, “Every aspect of Antichamber is made to get players out of their comfort zone.” Needless to say, I had to play it.
The beginning of Antichamber places you in a black, cubic room, with an explanation of controls on one wall, a picture of a fetus, a view of the exit (with an impassable wall between you and the door), and a wall with a single square that says, “Start here.” After some progression, you begin to question your understanding of the game. As you begin to understand the layout of the rooms, you realize, “Yeah, I get this, this is pretty straightforward, it’s just a little confusing sometimes.”
Then the game changes, and things previously understood must be completely restructured. Perhaps you stumbled upon a new room, or a new way to solve something you previously thought impossible — or you discovered a new mechanism you did not know existed. And this does not happen just once. It is clear that Alexander Bruce, the sole developer of Antichamber, knew what he was doing.
Antichamber never stops. In some games, when I get stuck on a puzzle, I’ll put down the controller, and come back to the game in a few days, a week — sometimes months. However, when you fail a puzzle in Antichamber, you don’t go back to the beginning of the challenge. Instead, you wind up somewhere completely unexpected, with an entirely different challenge ahead of you. Perhaps you can’t solve that puzzle. That’s okay; there’s another one waiting just beyond.
If for some reason the player gets completely stuck, Bruce discourages using a walkthrough. “You only get to experience the puzzles once,” he said in an interview with Ars Technica. “Take a break instead.” Combining that with the perfectly non-Euclidean world (where the laws of physics as we know them do not apply, and the expected should always be unexpected) and the wonderfully Escher-like corridors (where two lefts do not make a right, and three ups can make a down), you are treated to mind-melting, beautifully perplexing puzzles.
Bruce has made Antichamber as good as it can possibly be — and rightly so, since this project took almost four years to complete. It is simple, yet almost nauseatingly complex. It is an adventure, both through the impossible hallways of the game and through your own psyche. It is clever, intelligent, and unmistakably beautiful.
Bruce said he wanted to “create something that was out there, that people hadn’t seen before,” and he succeeded. This is a game that should help define the upcoming genre of first-person puzzle games, and it is certainly a benchmark. It may not be the first, but it is certainly the most prominent and farthest-reaching game to expand on this genre. In Bruce’s words, “There is a joy in exploring [because the game is so different]. Like kids climbing a tree, just to see what’s up there.”
I hope to always be able to be that kid in the tree, and hopefully this level of quality and inventiveness continues to grow in the game-making community.

“I want it to smack you in the face,” said senior music composition major Adam Shield, speaking of his modernism-inspired music. “I want to force you to remember it.”
Shield was one of four student composers who saw their original works performed by the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic on Friday night at Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall & Museum — and his piece, while smack-worthy, was not the only memorable one on the program. All four composers presented remarkably complex and professional works, performed in all their discordant glory by the School of Music’s best musicians.
No amateur could have written these pieces. Far from the short, simple tunes you might have written in high school music theory classes, these works are full-fledged, passionate, and experimental. The compositions shared many of the same complex musical elements: dissonant chords, moving dynamics, intricate rhythms layered on top of each other. But beyond these similarities, each piece showed a deep understanding of the technical capacity and emotional power of music.
As the opening piece on the program, Shield’s “Catharsis” got the evening off to a dark and chaotic start with crashing cymbals, sinister strings, and blaring brass. Despite the ominous tone that carried throughout, the piece had some truly beautiful moments: Warm, haunting solo lines staggered throughout each section for a rich layering effect.
Following Shield’s piece, master’s student in composition Hanna Kim’s work was titled “The Passion and Resurrection of Jesus Christ.” But far from the “Ave Maria” you might expect, the piece opened with a cacophony of clashing, unnerving percussion — evoking Jesus Christ being nailed to the cross — and a ghostly sliding sound as the violinists ran their fingers up and down the fingerboard, barely scraping the strings.
These outlandish musical elements created an eerie, disturbing effect to portray Kim’s vision of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Kim’s religious fervor was especially apparent at the end of the piece as the dynamics rose to a magnificent fortissimo; it was one of the few majestic moments of the concert when the orchestra’s sound was able to fill the entirety of the immense hall.
With such technically and rhythmically difficult pieces on the program, the orchestra had quite a challenge. Although some moments in the performance were stronger than others, the orchestra met this challenge with grace and skill, showcasing the collective technical skill of its members.
Shield in particular was pleased with the orchestra’s performance, after working for only a week one-on-one with the conductor in rehearsals. Inevitably, the orchestra experienced some bumps during rehearsals — but by Friday night’s performance, “90 percent of [the problems were fixed.”
In terms of venue, Soldiers & Sailors surely held significance for the student composers and the orchestra, but it seemed a poor acoustic choice. The space was so large and open that the high ceiling swallowed up much of the sound, especially in the string sections. Considering how sparse the audience was — there were only about 50 people in attendance — it seemed hard to justify using such a huge space.
At intermission, the program briefly deviated from student composition to celebrate the 2012 Concerto Competition winners. Artist Diploma alumna Catherine Gregory on flute and alumni Erin Dowrey, Jamie Pham, Jack Rago, and master’s student Lei Lei Hoi on percussion presented a well-performed Suite en Concert pour flûte et percussion by André Jolivet.
When the audience members returned to the hall, they were in for a fascinating second half of the program: Both senior composition major Sean Burke’s “Noir” and Artist Diploma student Jakub Polaczyk’s “Squirrel Ball with Major F” were chock full of eclectic musical elements.
The opening of “Noir” is a push-and-pull between the rhythmic, lulling undertone and the heralding trumpet and snare drum that cut through the strings. Burke did an interesting job of blending incongruous musical elements: In the program, he describes the work as “an episodic dialogue between two main stylistic themes, neoclassical orchestration and jazz harmony and melodies.” Though the result was not seamless — the jazz elements were inevitably a bit jarring — Burke was able to merge the two themes in an interesting and experimental way.
Polaczyk’s “Squirrel ball with Major F” built further on this loud-soft dichotomy. This piece is characterized by several eccentric touches — a strange, deep, drilling noise issuing from the contrabassoon and a sequence of haphazard pizzicati in the strings. And as a playful and quirky conclusion to the piece, several members of the orchestra reached into their pockets and sent ping-pong balls quietly clattering across the stage — cued by the conductor playing a pair of finger cymbals.
The concert was a magnificent display of the talent of student composers at Carnegie Mellon. With the level of complexity of each piece, it was hard to believe that students could approach their music with such ingenuity and skill.
According to Shield, he owes much of that skill to the Carnegie Mellon School of Music. After coming into the program with what he calls a “generic John Williams sound,” he quickly matured into a more complex and ambitious composer: “[The program] dramatically opened my eyes to what was possible.”
And speaking of possibilities, Shield has a wide range to choose from in his future ahead. In the immediate future, he plans to attend the Berklee School of Music’s master’s program in Valencia, Spain, which teaches scoring for film, television, and video games. Ultimately, Shield wants to write music for movies and video games.
For Shield, and surely for the other three composers as well, Friday night was “many years in the making.” Despite the modest attendance, the composers’ pride was visible and well deserved; the true pleasure of Friday’s performance lay in witnessing the fruits of their hard labor and sharing the concert space with such musical talent.

After wading through heaps of red tape, piles of patents, and a collection of copyrights, what does it actually mean to own something that you’ve created? Is an idea, a song, or a work of art something that you can own and keep to yourself, allowing no one else to build on it?
The Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar program sponsored a lecture last Monday by Lewis Hyde that examined these delicate questions. Hyde, who is the Richard L. Thomas Professor of Creative Writing at Kenyon College, has written several books on the subject, including his most recent, Common as Air: Revolution, Art, and Ownership.
Hyde’s lecture, entitled “The Cultural Commons and the Collective Being,” focused on collaboration and innovation. Though the lecture was somewhat scattered and felt thrown together, the message was still delivered clearly. The lecture was brief but inspiring, prompting the audience to pose a variety of questions on the common property debate.
Hyde’s argument centered on the idea of a common area for a community, which began in the Middle Ages in England. The commons was a large area in which everyone was permitted to graze their animals, plant crops, or help the community flourish in other ways.
In the midst of the differing opinions surrounding intellectual property, these ideals have been reinvented and reapplied to fit a modern context. Hyde’s lecture drew strong parallels between the fields of Medieval England and the vast ocean of culture in today’s world, specifically focusing on the controversy that surrounds collaboration, and on innovation that builds on art, music, or ideas that already exist.
The idea of a large pool of cultural material, be it art, music, ideas, or beliefs, that one can draw from in order to fashion something completely new and different is very alluring. In an age driven by innovation and the drive to get to the next big thing, it’s important to make all advancements publicly available, Hyde argued.
He went on to say that ever since the birth of our nation, the best and strongest ideas — such as the notions that drove the Constitution — have come from the spirit of collaboration. However, in more recent years, the battle for the right to own intellectual property has endangered these beliefs.
The lecture was relatively brief and very quirky, specifically the PowerPoint that accompanied it; the presentation featured relevant information juxtaposed with inexplicable pictures of Japanese trees. The overall message of the lecture was thought provoking and relevant, especially on our campus, which puts such a strong emphasis on creative collaboration and innovation. With more resources and ideas from which to draw, the realm of human creation positively explodes.
Imagine if red, blue, and yellow were all different ideas, created by three different people. Under the current copyright and patent laws — which, according to Hyde, discourage collaboration and the use of the ideas of others — we would never get to green, purple, orange, teal, magenta, or chartreuse. Think of all the colors that we have yet to discover.
Hyde believes that by changing not only the mindset of our culture — which puts so much emphasis on the ownership of ideas — but also the laws that restrict us as a creative community, we can expand upon our creative limits. All we need to do is add more paint samples to the mix and encourage painters to elaborate upon those that already exist.

Sony Corporation held a press event in New York City last Thursday to introduce the PlayStation 4 — its entry into the eighth generation of video game consoles. The PlayStation 4 — the PS4, as most of Sony’s promotional material calls it — will be competing with Nintendo’s Wii U and Microsoft’s next-generation console, which is still under wraps.
Sony seems to have a short memory, since this conference was rather light on both surprises and substantial content. There were feelings of dissatisfaction after the initial announcement of the PlayStation 3, which had few titles and no killer app. It seems odd that Sony is not doing everything in its power to prevent a repeat of the days when the cry “the PS3 has no games!” echoed far and wide across the Internet.
Even at this stage of the game, Sony hasn’t even revealed the physical model of the PS4. While the hardware exists and was used to demo technology and games, it remains unclear what the physical system will look like. Also, the final system specifications, price, and release date are still up in the air.
What actually was on display was underwhelming, and most of the coolest features had caveats. It’s very neat to be able to use the PlayStation Vita — Sony’s already-released handheld console — as a sort of bootleg Wii U GamePad for displaying games running on the home console and for acting as a touch-screen interface. But it also means you will need to buy a PS Vita.
Sony also promised a novel cloud-based solution to the issue of backward compatibility with games from previous PlayStation consoles. Gaikai, a service that Sony recently acquired that streams games like movies or music, will be putting the back catalog online for PS4 users. However, this means that there will be no out-of-the-box support for old games, and it remains unclear whether or not users will need to pay to access games they already own.
In addition, a new emphasis on integrating Facebook sharing into games and encouraging social play has resulted in many new features, including a button on the controller that allows you to share your gameplay on the fly — assuming you make gaming a central part of your life. While no doubt a great asset for makers of machinima and players who like to spoil game endings, most people will need to develop new gaming and social media habits for this feature to be utilized well.
Speaking of social media: Bungie, Inc., which pioneered many aspects of social gaming (including on-the-fly video capture), made one of the least climactic announcements of the event. Creators of the Halo franchise, Bungie let the world know that its hotly anticipated next game, Destiny, will be featured on the PS4. What Bungie didn’t communicate with its sparse footage of gameplay was that the game will also be released on the current generation of consoles — the PS3 as well as the Xbox 360.
The way Sony represented it, the PS4 came across as a bundle of improvements instead of a game changer (pun intended). Inconsequential features — like being able to download a game’s update in the screen’s background during play — were touted at a presentation that did not promise much and delivered little. Hopefully for Sony and its fans, more developments will soon come to light.

Dear Patrick,
I’m tired of this whole school thing. Can I just become a trophy wife already? I’m pretty burnt out, and I think I have what it takes. Help me make this work.
Thanks,
Wanting Attention Now, Need Affluent Beau, Erstwhile Work Is Feeling Enough
Dear WANNA-BE WIFE,
Not all of us are lucky enough to get by on our good looks (otherwise, I’d be out of a job). But maybe you’re one of the lucky few. Normally, I would say something about how you shouldn’t choose a lifestyle where you’re only judged based on your looks — but as a feminist, I will support you and tell you exactly how to go about it.
Your best bet is probably picking up tennis and hanging around a country club. Lots of trophy wives will already be there, and they can give you some tips for breaking into the business. Alternatively, you could head out to the yacht club if you’re the seafaring type. If you’re not into old men, you could try latching onto a CS major with a startup idea. He’ll be happy enough to have the attention that he won’t question your motives. Although an old man would probably be more tolerable.
Or join a Russian dating website (as a Russian),

Dear Patrick,
I’m graduating soon and need to find a replacement for my job. There’s this one guy who’s actively gunning for the job, but he’s being a little creepy about it. He’s left notes saying stuff like “I will become you!” and I think he wants to eat my still-beating heart. How do I know if he’s the right man for the job?
Thanks,
Reluctantly Evicted, Personally Lacking Adequate Claimant, Erudition Desired
Dear REPLACED,
Choosing a replacement is a hard task. I would suggest your employers leave your position open in perpetuity. I mean, who could fill your shoes?
But if they don’t go for it, there’s only one solution: a series of challenges! Whoever completes them will prove himself worthy of being your replacement. He must be wise, resilient, soulful, and good with puns. The cinnamon challenge, to test his wisdom. The gallon challenge, his resilience. Watching The Iron Giant, his soul. Last and most important of all, comes the Com-pun-tition. If he can pass these trials, then he may be worthy.
Or just give it to whomever asks,
Patrick Hoskins

Goldfinger
8 10 12
This film is easily the most fun Bond film of the Connery catalog. The first half is flat-out terrific, with an iconic, indelible moment popping up roughly every five minutes. This film features maybe the only attempt to kill Bond via some absurdly elaborate method that actually makes sense — at least in terms of how Bond survives. This film contains arguably the best villain, arguably the best Bond Girl, arguably the best theme song, arguably the best henchman, and unquestionably the best car. In terms of Bond movies, this was as good as it got for a long time. 
The Spy Who Loved Me
7:30 10 12:30
This film is often hailed as the peak of the Roger Moore years. For me, it would have been best to set the franchise on hiatus during that period. Nonetheless, it is the best entry in Roger Moore’s run. Jaws’ antics and Ken Adams’ unbelievable set pieces are somewhat inspiring, but otherwise, this is middle-of-the-road Bond. Admittedly, however, many see some excellence in it, and it certainly has one of the more appealing Bond Girls. Pitting the “forces” of Britain against the veritable war-machine of the USSR is unbelievable, but intriguing.
Skyfall
7 10 1
Aside from trying to be a Christopher Nolan film, playing up a sappy backstory, and going full-out Freudian at the end, Skyfall is undeniably the best Bond picture we’ve had in at least two decades. The Shanghai set piece is one of the year’s best, thanks to the digital cinematography of Roger Deakins (best known for his work with the Coen brothers). Javier Bardem makes an amply cartoonish villain that, if mildly forgettable, is certainly performed with commitment. Daniel Craig is proving to be a spectacular Bond, providing a sneaky meta-commentary on the aging franchise.
GoldenEye
7:30 10 12:30
In terms of the video game, GoldenEye gets five gold stars and a handshake. Each of our childhoods is probably populated by memories of that all-time great first-person shooter. But does anyone actually remember the movie? It was Pierce Brosnan’s first take on the role and his most admirable — but that’s not saying much, since he was a fairly dismal 007. Anyway, there are always free points for any film involving Alan Cumming.

In the rare event of cancelled classes, The Tartan asks students what they did on their unexpected day off. Most students spent the day alternating between sleeping, doing homework, and visiting with friends. Others, though, took full advantage of the freedom. One student said, “At about 4 a.m. I drank. I jumped down Donner hill and I don’t remember much.”

Carnegie Mellon welcomed President-Elect Subra Suresh and his family with pomp and circumstance on Thursday night, with a series of speeches in McConomy Auditorium and a reception in Rangos Hall.
The speakers, introduced by a bagpiper, included outgoing university President Jared Cohon, chairman of the Board of Trustees Ray Lane, and Will Weiner, senior economics and statistics and decision science double major and student body president. Suresh spoke last.
The bulk of Cohon’s and Lane’s speeches addressed the process by which the search committee found and selected Suresh as the university’s next president.
In addition to thanking the presidential search committee, Lane told the story of the Board of Trustees’ first discussion two years ago about who they wanted for the university’s next president.
“If anyone had told me back then that the process would go as well as it went for the last two years, I just would not have believed them,” Lane said. “I’ve been around the track too many times to know that things go as planned. But this went pretty much as planned, and I give a lot of credit, if not all the credit, to the search committee.”
Suresh, who is the current director of the National Science Foundation and former dean of the school of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that his first action upon taking office will be to go on a “listening tour” of the university.
“I’m looking forward to holding many open forums, listening to students, faculty, and staff, to get [the] very different perspectives that exist in a university like this,” Suresh said.
The students, faculty, and staff who attended the event seemed to come away with a sense of optimism.
“[I’m excited about] the fact that he is so positive and forward thinking, and is excited to be here and be part of our community and get to know us,” said lighting design professor Cindy Limauro. 
“I think his past record has proven that he is a good leader and will be somebody that I think will command respect from the faculty, the students, and the staff, and will go on this journey with us.” 
Weiner shared Limauro’s enthusiasm for Suresh, with whom he got to speak personally during the preparations for the event.
“Clearly on paper he’s amazing, but he’s [also] a really great guy,” Weiner said. “Just chatting with him, he’s really approachable, really down to earth, and has a really good idea of how he can work with students and how he can make this place better.”
Student Body Vice President of Finance Jon Mark, who met with Suresh and the other presidential candidates when they visited the university prior to the Board of Trustees’ decision, agreed.
“He was a really great guy from the get-go,” Mark said. “He answered our questions really candidly and honestly, and I think that he was a really clear choice for a president. He’s going to push the university in a really great direction.”
Both Weiner and Mark stressed the importance of a good relationship between the president and students.
“I urge next year’s students to work with him, just help him understand how the student process works and really make sure to establish that relationship early on,” Weiner said.
Mark hoped that Suresh would make sure to remember students.
“One of the biggest things that I would encourage him to do is to really make sure that as a president, he’s going to prioritize the student experience,” Mark said.
“I think that right now he’s going to push this university in a lot of great ways, but I think that it can’t be forgotten that there are people here for four years, that it means a lot to them that they have a president that … [will] really make sure that it’s the best experience it can be.”
Suresh spoke of his upcoming tenure as president with excitement. 
“As I get to know this community better, I’m confident that we have a common mission and a common goal. We all very firmly believe that Carnegie Mellon is a great institution. But we also firmly believe that Carnegie Mellon is an institution that has all the ingredients and potential for much greater greatness. I very much look forward to working with you to achieve that,” he said.

A group of Carnegie Mellon students is devoted to improving life for schoolchildren in Rwanda. Project Rwanda, a service initiative founded in 2010, recently began recruiting students for an upcoming trip to Rwanda. 
This group partnered with One Laptop Per Child (OLPC), a nonprofit organization that offers inexpensive laptops to children in developing countries. OLPC has distributed 110,000 laptops to children in Rwanda; however, many of these laptops go unused due to a lack of understanding of the technology. 
Project Rwanda teaches primary school students in Kigali, Rwanda, how to use these laptops through classes in programming, typing, and creative thinking.
Alexander Rothera, a senior fine art and human and computer interaction double major and member of the Project Rwanda team, described his visit to Rwanda. “There was this really incredible moment when we first got there, and they had this giant padlock on the storage closet that they opened up. And then he opens the door, and there’s a mound of laptops covered in dust. They were brand new, and no one had opened them. The school that we went to had 400 laptops unused.”
During their visit, the Carnegie Mellon students were able to put all 400 laptops into use. Many of these Rwandan students had never used a computer before. Through the help of talented translators, the Carnegie Mellon students taught them simple gestures, such as left clicking and right clicking. They instructed students in programming by having them play logic games and also encouraged students to use their creativity through acting and public speaking classes.
Senior global studies major and Project Rwanda team member Sara Faradji worked with Rwandan students in drama classes. 
Faradji said, “There is no fine arts education in Rwanda. They don’t do music or drama. They don’t have theaters. It’s a very timid society … they’re all wearing their little uniforms, and are very respectful. I wanted them to be more confident: talk in front of their peers, be more creative. It was great to see how they started out really shy in the beginning, and then as they started warming up, they became much more lively and were really excited to show their work.”
The Carnegie Mellon students were only able to work with two grades of Rwandan students in a single primary school and were unable to connect with the teachers on summer break. 
In order to reach out to more students, Project Rwanda is working to expand its program.
When this project was initiated, it was unforeseen that a Carnegie Mellon campus would be started in Rwanda. 
Carnegie Mellon Pittsburgh’s Project Rwanda is now hoping to partner with both the campuses in Qatar and Rwanda to grow the program and develop a continuous presence among Rwandan primary school students.
This summer, Project Rwanda is hoping to send eight to 10 students each from the Pittsburgh and Qatar campuses to Rwanda for two to three weeks. Interviews are currently being conducted to select the group of students from Pittsburgh.
Goals of the project include establishing a Mentor-Mentee program between Carnegie Mellon Rwanda graduate students and local youths; launching a One Day Summer Reunion for children who have participated in the program since 2010; and using cross-campus video conferencing to connect youths from Rwanda, Qatar, and Pittsburgh.
Rwanda is often associated with war and genocide, so many question why Rwanda was chosen as the site of the project. 
However, Rwanda is also one of the fastest-developing African countries. 
Rwanda was the first country in which women were the majority of those elected to serve in the national legislature. 
Efforts are also being made to sustain electricity coverage and to provide a national communication fiber-optic network to 30 districts. The Rwanda Ministry of Education outlines a priority of “making post-basic education more accessible and more relevant to our national needs.”
“Maybe [the children] can one day go to a school like CMU in Rwanda. It’s something that no one has heard of before, and something that the president of Rwanda really supports. Part of his initiative is rebuilding Rwanda after the years of genocide through technological education,” Faradji said.
Rothera added that it’s important to look at “the great things that can happen in the country, and how incredible the students are at learning—basically, the potential for such a small country. They have great plans and leadership for how to move forward.”
Both Faradji and Rothera are planning to stay involved with Project Rwanda after graduating from Carnegie Mellon this spring.

The nature of higher education, as well as potential strategies to improve and facilitate learning at the university level, were key topics of discussion at the lecture “Between Academia and Activism: a Roundtable on Reforming American Higher Education.”
The event, hosted last Thursday in Baker Hall’s Swank Room (255B), started with presentations from a five-member panel and ended with a round-table discussion on the state of higher education in America. 
The Swank Room was crowded for this event, and the small classroom’s round-table format suited the discussion-based nature of the panel.
The first speaker was Carolyn Commer, a Ph.D. candidate in rhetoric. Commer’s talk, titled “Educating for Citizenship: the Possibilities and Pitfalls of the Civic Frame for Higher Education,” focused on the role of citizens and the public sphere in higher education reform.
Robin Sowards, a faculty member at Duquesne University, titled his talk “Adjunct Unions Normalization and the Future of Higher Education;” he listed 15 major problems that he sees in higher education and proposed a plan for systemic change. Sowards’ list of problems with higher education ranged from climbing student debt levels to the treatment of underpaid adjunct faculty.
“All of these problems are interconnected, in the sense that they’re all causally related,” Sowards said. 
“And it also forms a cycle. At any point you enter it, you can always cycle back to some other point — there’s no point at which it terminates. Now, that cyclical property is bad; since things are causally related, once a single problem is exacerbated it further exacerbates all the other problems,” he said.
Heather Steffen, a Ph.D. candidate in literary and cultural studies, called her presentation “The Ph.D. Vampire Squid,” a play on an essay over 100 years old by Harvard philosopher William James, “The Ph.D. Octopus.” 
James’ essay discussed the problems with the Ph.D. programs in American colleges in 1903, when the essay was published. 
Steffen, similarly, talked about the problems with modern Ph.D. programs, recommending changes like stipends for graduate students closer to the current living wage.
Steffen is also a member of the Modern Language Association’s (MLA) Committee on the Status of Graduate Students in the Profession. 
The committee, according to the MLA website, “will consider a range of curricular, intellectual, and professional issues that affect graduate students in language and literature.”
“With average doctoral time to degree at nine-and-a-half years, and a labor system in which 75 percent of college teachers will never be eligible for tenure, and a tenure-track job market whose bottom dropped out in the ’70s, and the ’80s, and the ’90s, and in 2008, humanities graduate education seems to be, as [MLA President] Michael F. Bérubé puts it, a ‘seamless garment of crisis,’ ” Steffen said.
The next panelist, professor of English and literary cultural studies Jeffrey Williams, gave a presentation titled “Proper Recognition.” 
Williams discussed a handout showing rising average student debt compared with inflation, and a list of the top 100 highest university endowments.
According to Williams, the inflated tuition at most universities is caused by widespread privatization, and universities’ refusal to spend their endowments.
The last panelist to speak was Jess Wilton, a Ph.D. candidate in literary and cultural studies. 
Wilton called her talk “The Saxifrage School: Disruptive Innovation beyond Neoliberalism.” 
Wilton’s title references the Saxifrage School, described on its website as a “higher education laboratory working to lower costs, rethink the campus, and reconcile disciplines.”
The Saxifrage School, Wilton said, follows a model of “disruptive innovation,” a term coined by Harvard economist Clayton Christensen. Although Christensen applied the term to big business, Wilton wants to apply it to higher education, as modeled by the Saxifrage School.
After the panelists had finished their presentations, the audience, comprised mostly of graduate students in the English department, put forward their own questions and opinions.
Sheila Liming, a Ph.D. candidate in literary and cultural studies in attendance at the panel, said that the discussion “represents the idea that problems with universities are systemic in a large way, and the answers are going to be systemic in a large way too. Solutions are going to be systemic, meaning that you can’t fix any one level. You can’t just fix undergraduate education; you can’t just target the graduate level or even labor issues, you have to look at the whole picture.”
David Haeselin, another Ph.D. candidate in literary and cultural studies, was glad that the panelists addressed the issue of labor in the university setting. 
“I’m glad to see that labor was first and foremost; everyone was addressing it in some way or another…. It was great to get a community conversation in an interdisciplinary setting.”

Carnegie Mellon has seen a new wave of students contributing to “hacking” culture over the course of recent years. 
One campus club that has contributed to this trend is Make CMU, a hacking-based organization that encourages students to “make things with computers,” according to the group’s website. 
Organizations such as Make CMU are now focused on this field to further growth, support, and space for hacking on campus. 
They are also trying increase diversity by searching for students outside traditional technical majors and merging the technological and creative portions of the student body. 
Senior computer science major Amy Quispe noticed that “in the last two-and-a half years, things have been changing a lot here,” as more students have developed a heightened interest in things like “hacker spaces, hacker groups, and the Internet.”
As a result, in 2011, Quispe founded ScottyLabs. Initially a personal side project, the project has since become a student-run group. 
According to its website, ScottyLabs strives to “use technical expertise to promote innovation in practical ways.” 
ScottyLabs is involved in a number of different projects, including developing an application programming interface to store educational data for Carnegie Mellon and schools throughout the country. 
ScottyLabs is also responsible for the creation and organization of TartanHacks, the highly successful and well-attended hackathon that takes place annually on campus. 
It also heads SkillSwap Weekend, an event held on the fourth floor of the Gates Hillman Complex that “teaches people things they wish they knew.”
Quispe said, “People were trying to make things, but were [prohibited from doing so].”
She noted that ScottyLabs’ main goal is to provide students the opportunity of “being empowered to turn ideas into code.” 
According to Quispe, “students at CMU have what they need to get started on side products and get skills and students they need to build truly great things.” 
Quispe believes that ScottyLabs should not be about a major, but about making goals and ideas come to fruition.
Along with launching the activities described before, ScottyLabs now leads Make CMU sessions.
These sessions, during which students take time to help each other with ideas, take place every Saturday from 2–6 p.m. in the Studio for Creative Inquiry in the College of Fine Arts Building.
Another student organization on campus looking to capitalize on the developing “hacker” culture is the Computer Club. 
Christian Preseau, sophomore computer science major, noted the Computer Club focuses on work with “infrastructure that’s useful for student activities.” 
According to Sam Gruber, the club’s co-president and junior BCSA student in computer science and architecture, members of the club meet in Cyert Hall and collaborate on a number of projects, including creating various demos and providing services for entities and campus functions like TartanHacks.
With steadily increasing attendance, organizations such as ScottyLabs and the Computer Club are interested in being given additional space to do work.
Preseau, for instance, noted that his club often has to work in the hallway, which leads to obvious difficulties. 
Bryan Wade, senior economics major, is particularly interested in the expansion of this culture.
With plans for a new University Center design in the future, Wade, Quispe, and other students of Make CMU said they would ideally like to have a space designated in the building for their organizations. 
Wade elaborated that “there are already spaces, but there’s no software.” Talks are still considered exploratory and in the preliminary stage of discussion; several groups have been trying to secure an area. 
Quispe hopes a future space in the University Center would also host peer education programs.
Nonetheless, group members think that more can be done to increase involvement of students in other majors. 
Wade noted that “a lot of people are intimidated by it and are scared off by people who are not receptive.” 
Quispe thinks some people are hesitant when they hear the word “hacker” because over time it has developed an unfriendly connotation to people outside the hacking community. 
Quispe is glad that design students, in particular, have been drawn to ScottyLabs, but at the same time is looking to  appeal to others who can contribute.
Preseau believes people have an “interest in what we do, particularly in collaborative hacking,” but that many think twice about joining. “We really want to do more outreach to other colleges,” Preseau said. 
He added that the organization is looking for more people, particularly those interested in computational art. 
Similarly, Quispe looks to spread the word to that weekly Make CMU meetings are open to all, regardless of major. 
In the future, organizations like ScottyLabs and the Computer Club hope to further expand while bringing together students of varying degrees and interests.

StuCo on Carnegie Mellon culture
Members of Student Senate are working toward developing a StuCo course on campus culture. This would involve upperclassmen passing knowledge down to first-year students and attempting to address issues of fitting in at Carnegie Mellon. 
The specifics of this course are being developed in conjunction with Academic Development.
CMU Student Experience Survey
Janel Sutkus, Director of Institutional Research and Analysis for Carnegie Mellon, reported on the CMU Student Experience Survey, which is distributed at the end of each year. 
Last year, the survey had a 51 percent response rate among undergraduate students. 
The survey largely focuses on student satisfaction, specifically in terms of classes, parking, and athletic opportunities. 
Responses from students included information on self-perception, potential leadership abilities, faculty and staff mentoring, and other factors, including amount of sleep received and time spent on physical fitness.
Sexual Harassment and Assault Policy
Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno spoke to the Senate regarding the steps the university is taking to overhaul its sexual assault and sexual harassment policies. Feedback from Town Halls and discussions regarding sexual assault and harassment were taken into account when refining this policy. 
A meeting will be held in March for a final vote on this policy.
Business Affairs
Student Senate members are meeting with USA Today to discuss distribution of their newspaper for Carnegie Mellon students. Additionally, data has been collected from the Arts Pass survey and will be used when renegotiating the program in March.
Allocations
AB Films requested funds for a new projector, given that their current one is beginning to fall apart. A digital projector was requested — one that would show films in higher resolution and offer the potential to show 3-D films. Funding for a new projector was approved.

David Cameron, prime minister of the United Kingdom, expressed regret last Wednesday over the Jallianwala Bagh massacre during a visit to the area to discuss trade agreements. The bloodbath took place in the Jallianwala Bagh public gardens in Amritsar, a city in northern India. Fifty British soldiers fired on a crowd of Indian protesters. British sources reported the death toll at 379, while the Indian National Congress estimated that the number was closer to 1,000.
The date of this tragedy? 1919.
Acknowledging the crimes that the British Empire committed in India is important, but there is a difference between “expressing regret” and actually acknowledging fault. Cameron didn’t even apologize fully. This declaration was also made during a trip to India to discuss trade agreements, which makes the sincerity of his statements even more questionable. Admitting that the massacre was a travesty paints both Cameron and the United Kingdom in a better light; though that benefit was probably not Cameron’s only motive, this sudden revelation of national culpability is certainly convenient. 
Cameron is not the first man in politics to dance around wrongdoing. History has no shortage of “almost” apologies, even with the Jallianwala Bagh massacre itself. Cameron “offered his regrets,” just as Queen Elizabeth labeled it “a terrible tragedy” in 1997. In fact, in 1920, Winston Churchill referred to the event as “monstrous.” He was not the prime minister at the time, and once he actually gained power, he was markedly less sympathetic to the Indian plight. 
Cameron did not apologize, because if he apologizes for Jallianwala Bagh, what’s stopping him from apologizing for the Bengal famine of 1943? Why not apologize for any of the other famines in India caused by British mismanagement and neglect — or for the conflicts and bouts of imperialism they visited upon other nations, such as Afghanistan? The list of peoples wronged throughout history is a long one. 
Apologies, once begun, are difficult to stop.
And even if Cameron had offered India a full and complete acknowledgement of the evils of British colonialism in the early 1900s, what true good would that have done?
There is no bravery in apologizing for something that you have no control over. Sometimes it is necessary, but acknowledging the immorality of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre does not cost Cameron much. The massacre happened about 100 years ago. The current British government had no agency in the event.
Admitting that the legacies of colonialism still deeply impact the world today would be a braver act.
The massacre at Jallianwala Bagh is not still relevant today because 1,000 people were killed by an imperial oppressor in 1919. Of course the victims of that day deserved to remembered and honored. But the massacre itself is still relevant because it was part of a greater narrative of colonialism and oppression by imperial powers. Great Britain was one of those powers, but it was not the only one.
India, as a nation, still struggles with the after-effects of colonialism. A Harvard University study by economist Lakshmi Iyer concluded that specific regions within India that were under direct British rule still have more difficulties accessing schools and health centers, and that colonialism still impacts colonized nations greatly in the postcolonial period.
Cameron’s efforts would perhaps be better spent recognizing the lingering impacts of colonialism itself instead of apologizing for a single tragedy in that narrative.

If there is one talent that American kids possess, it is using computers to navigate the world of the Internet. It’s strange to think how kids today grow up online — as you can tell from their detailed Facebook timelines — while the older generations can barely figure out how to work a keyboard. However, senior citizens are relearning what’s groovy: Their grandkids are ready to use their computer skills to teach grandma and grandpa how to work Facebook, Twitter, and beyond.
Students from Mt. Lebanon’s Mellon Middle School in Pittsburgh are sharing their talents by teaching computer skills to the elderly after school. Once a week, kids volunteer for about an hour to explain Gmail and social media platforms to local senior citizens. The way I see it, it’s a win-win for both generations.
The most obvious victors in this situation are the senior citizens — after even a single lesson, grandma can log online.
The elderly step away from class equipped to navigate the Internet. They can discover holiday recipes or reconnect with old neighbors. They can surprise their children with emails, and their grandchildren with e-cards. 
In an age where online communication is the preferred means of connection, it is essential that everyone has the skills to access this new method of interaction. What better way to learn about online communication than with the help of youths?
As rewarding of an experience this is for the elderly, it is equally beneficial for the students. The middle school’s new program is a hands-on way for young adolescents to give back to their community and to interact with a generation that they often do not — with the exception of their grandparents.
This new program is also a creative paradigm for other schools looking to get their students involved. Neighboring schools should follow the lead of the Mt. Lebanon school to get their children involved with technology in a way that is beneficial to not only themselves, but to a wider audience. Mellon Middle School should be applauded for its creative way of teaching students about community involvement and technology through experience.
Technology moves quickly, and innovative practices are as important as innovative technology. The new program at Mellon Middle School gives children a hands-on taste of what it means to be a leader; since the Internet is a tool younger people feel comfortable with, they can confidently teach their elders how to use it. Middle school kids are rarely granted responsibilities; this program is a fun and easy way for them to take up that first challenge.

Since the days of Immanuel Kant, Jeremy Bentham, and John Stuart Mill, a continuing ethical debate has raged between consequentialist ethics and nonconsequentialist ethics. Consequentialists believe that the morality of an action lies in its consequences, while nonconsequentialists believe that ethics are mostly based on intentions.
This ethical difference is a large reason why liberals and conservatives are in opposition when it comes to economic policy.
Utilitarianism is a form of consequentialist ethics that states that the thing that results in the greatest good for the greatest number of people is the right thing to do. Liberals believe that taxing the rich more than others is the right thing to do because the law of diminishing marginal returns states that as you get more of something, you enjoy it less. In other words, $1,000 would do more good in the hands of someone who has $10,000 than someone who has $100,000. Thus, redistribution is the right thing for the government to do.
Conservatives disagree on this point. Kantian ethics sets forth two rules: First, an action can only be right if you could wish to live in a world where everyone takes that action. Secondly, actions are only right if they respect another person’s rational ability to make decisions.
My counterargument calls for higher taxes on the rich is, “why is it that when you make $250,000, you suddenly deserve your money less?” This is a very nonconsequentialist argument. People’s rational minds are disrespected when the fruits of their labor are taken from them, regardless of how much they make. Coercive government is wrong for just this reason. The more government actions that can be taken voluntarily, the better. The more privately owned toll roads we have, the better. People shouldn’t be forced to pay for things or take actions that they don’t want.
As an overarching example, all relationships between consenting adults should be legal and noncoercive. This includes jobs that pay less than minimum wage, legalization of drugs, and gay marriage. These are voluntary relationships that are entered into because they benefit all parties involved. When the government interferes, this disrespects the rationality of the parties that engage in these relationships. This is wrong.
Yet there exists cognitive dissonance among those with any sort of political views. Liberals take a nonconsequentialist stance on social issues such as civil rights. Any infringement on these rights is disrespecting someone’s rationality. Conservatives take on consequentialist points of view, yet somehow argue that gay marriage is bad for the community.
Cognitive dissonance exists in my own mind, too. Despite only wanting a voluntary government, I think public schooling is the best thing ever. 
While I can justify forcing kids to attend public school until they’re 18 because they’re not yet rational adults, getting money from the government to fund these schools is not something that I believe in. In this instance, I’m a pure consequentialist, even though I don’t believe that consequentialism is right.
Many of the political differences that we see in the current spectrum of liberals and conservatives come from differences in prioritizing consequentialism and nonconsequentialism. Liberals and conservatives disagree about the arenas in which either view is more valid. These disagreements are not just political disagreements — they are ethical ones that philosophers have argued about for centuries.
Neither view is right or wrong, specifically because they’re arguing about what, in fact, is right and wrong. 
Yet the basic questions that these disagreements come down to is: How appropriate is it for the government to restrict people’s freedom in exchange for securing positive outcomes for people, and how effective is the government at doing this?
My answer is “not very” to these questions, in most cases. The government is inherently inefficient. Anything the government can do, the private sector can do better. Yet this doesn’t apply in all cases. We all have cognitive dissonance. Reconciling this is the pragmatic challenge that all who hold political opinions face.

Attention; stop the presses, everyone. Blue Ivy Carter, the daughter of Beyoncé and Jay-Z, is reading. At only 13 months.
USA Today and The Huffington Post  both reported extensively on the child prodigy’s progress last week. She’s started talking, and with reading thrown into the mix, it’s only a matter of time until Blue Ivy actually takes over the world. She’s already got the greatest parents ever in Beyoncé and Jay-Z, and has been in the spotlight more times than most celebrity babies, so there’s little to stop her.
Once Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s baby is born, the two babies could team up and their world domination would be unavoidable. Imagine the news coverage then: updates on the duo’s outings, their matching outfits, whom they deem worthy to play with. Twitter might explode.
But, seriously, why is this news?
Granted, children usually start reading around the first grade, according to the children’s health section on WebMD.com. So yes, Blue Ivy may be a prodigy, but my point still stands. She’s barely a year old and there have already been too many news stories chronicling her every moment; similarly, there have been a number of articles on the “Kimye” baby, who isn’t even born yet. All in all, it’s a bit ridiculous.
Celebrity news is a million-dollar franchise primarily because people are obsessed with everything and anything celebrity related. In 2012, People magazine had a circulation of 3,637,633, Us Weekly had 1,964,446, and Entertainment Weekly had 1,781,315, according to the Alliance for Audited Media. Those circulation numbers couldn’t be supported if the magazines didn’t have a large net of loyal readership.
So, understandably, celebrities will fill the news cycles; it’s what the people seem to want. It’s a sad truth, but one that I can accept. What I can’t accept, though, is the trend of reporting on celebrity babies. I find it unsettling and creepy.
Imagine what it took to get some of the stories we see on the newsstands. The lengths to which these reporters and photographers go to get these stories is actually insane. There’s dedication and then there’s a violation of privacy and human decency. Think about it: Would you really want your child’s every moment — from conception to birth to toddler years — documented and circulated among millions of people?
And, no, it does not matter that they are celebrities and “they signed up for this.” That argument is flawed in and of itself. The mere fact that someone is famous does not give anyone the right to harass them, pry into their lives, follow them from store to store, or wait outside their house. Regardless of how you feel about celebrities and their right to privacy, their children did not sign up for this. They’re exactly that — children. It’s time to give them some space to grow into normal humans unscarred by the limelight (we all saw how Macaulay Culkin turned out — it wasn’t pretty). Go report on something that actually matters.

In his State of the Union Address earlier this month, President Obama proposed raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $9 by 2015 and then continually adjusting it to inflation. Obama’s proposal is a breath of fresh air; the United States is long overdue for a raise in minimum wages.
As expected, the proposal received sizable backlash, notably from Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who denounced the very concept of minimum wage laws, and Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-Ohio), who stated that raising the minimum wage leads to greater unemployment.
Both of these responses indicate a larger trend in political discourse — an over-reliance on suppositions, as well as an alarming disregard for inductive reasoning. For example, both Boehner and Rubio’s reactions were based purely in theory and emotion, and simultaneously lacked supporting evidence. If the world worked according to economic theory, as both Boehner and Rubio seem to believe, then their concerns should be taken quite seriously. The inverse relationship between minimum wage and employment is a textbook example of theoretical economics.
However, this is not the case. Studies published by the University of California, Berkeley and the Center for Economic Policy and Research have both shown that increases in the minimum wage have not resulted in any significant increases in unemployment. 
Vermont and Washington, both of which have state-mandated minimum wages that are closer to the proposed $9 than the current federal standard, have unemployment rates that are no higher than the national mean — 5.1 percent and 7.6 percent, respectively, versus 7.9 percent in January 2013, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. San Francisco, which has the highest minimum wage at $10.55  according to the Labor Standards Enforcement agency of San Francisco, actually has a lower unemployment rate — approximately 6.7 percent — than the national average. 
In addition, the federally mandated minimum wage in 1978 — $2.65, according to the Department of Labor — is equivalent to $9.36 when adjusted for inflation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics; worker productivity doubled during that time frame, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
With this data, raising the minimum wage is the obvious path to take. In addition to raising the living standard of millions of Americans, Obama’s proposed increase would result in an influx of $21 billion into the economy, according to Doug Hall of the Economic Policy Institute. Considering the current state of the economy, this is another no-brainer.
It is a shame that there are politicians who insist on maintaining party ideologies instead of integrating data and research preformed by experts into their decision-making processes. Politicians, especially those as prominent as Boehner and Rubio, should know better than to conflate ideals with facts. This conflation is essentially playing partisan politics with the livelihoods of millions of Americans, and it’s unacceptable. For the United States to remain a relevant force in the global economy, it is essential to move towards political empiricism and abandon baseless appeals to pathos. If we continue to choose to base our opinions on theoretical ideals instead of practical results, then progress will become nothing more than a dream.

Student government announced via survey that it would review possible expansions to the student Arts Pass program. The program currently gives students free access to museums and galleries in Pittsburgh, including the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, the Andy Warhol Museum, and the Mattress Factory. The program is being reviewed to see if free access to additional locations can be included. Extending the program may take a great effort, and student government should be commended for its initiative.
It’s not uncommon to hear students complain that Pittsburgh doesn’t have the appeal of a larger city. “There’s nothing to do” is a popular sentiment, especially among underclassmen. However, the Arts Pass program is a gateway for Carnegie Mellon students to discover all that Pittsburgh has to offer. It entices students to leave the comforts of campus and explore the museums and galleries in the region.
The program is vital to ensure that students have a realistic impression of a city that is their home for at least four years. Additionally, the program allows students to become aware of the region and develop a set of diverse interests through hands-on learning experiences. Increasing student accessibility to Pittsburgh’s various attractions is a noble pursuit toward giving students a great college experience.
Any expansion of the program, however, must be done responsibly. Access to additional locations may increase the fee associated with the program — a possibility that all parties should be wary of as discussions of the program move forward.
The Arts Pass program is a valuable perk that Carnegie Mellon students have, and efforts to expand it are welcome. Ensuring the satisfaction and well-being of students during their time on campus is one of the responsibilities of the student government, even if that satisfaction comes from attractions off campus. Evaluating and expanding the Arts Pass program effectively should help make Carnegie Mellon, and Pittsburgh as a whole, a better place for students to live and learn.

First came the hamster dance, then Gangnam Style, and now the Harlem Shake. Carnegie Mellon students performed the latest Internet dance sensation for a YouTube video as part of the growing trend of Harlem Shake videos.
While many people have become annoyed with the phenomenon, we applaud the members of the Carnegie Mellon community for having a little fun and participating in this bizarre pop culture phenomenon. 
Performed by celebrities such as T-Pain, Matt & Kim, and even Wayne Brady, the Harlem Shake has become a small but integral event in modern Internet culture.
On top of that, the Hunt Library location was well selected, adding a sense of irony for viewers acquainted with Carnegie Mellon. Not only did the stunt provide the third floor — also known as the quiet floor — with the most fun it has seen in years, it also paid homage to the library’s satirical nickname “Club Hunt.”
Additionally, the ridiculous costumes (or lack thereof) that students wore — including a chicken suit, a banana, and the campus mascot, the Scotty dog — were welcome additions to the video; they are sure to elicit a few laughs and a sense of pride from some members of the community.
This activity was well implemented despite its spontaneity and the short time organizers had to find interested parties.
We hope that this trend of quirky campus activities — including Zombie Runs hosted by Alternative Breaks and Donut Dash run by SAE — does not die out, as we foresee will happen with the hype surrounding the Harlem Shake.
Rather, we encourage students to continue participating in activities that bring them into contact with people they would not otherwise meet during their weekly routines on campus.
After all, college is about the experiences with your fellow peers and the surrounding staff; what better way to create bonds than to participate in activities that automatically create a sense of community and camaraderie?

Since the 2002–03 academic year, the No Child Left Behind Act tied federal school funding to student performances on standardized state tests. Now, the first students to have their entire educational experience impacted by this law are finishing high school. Colleges must now handle students who have been taught that learning is synonymous with passing a multiple-choice exam.
The act, meant to close the achievement gap by rewarding good tests scores financially, was established with good intentions but was poorly executed. 
Recently retired high school teacher Kenneth Bernstein wrote an article in Academe, the journal of American Association of University Professors, highlighting the problems he saw in his students since the implementation of No Child Left Behind. He warns college professors not to blame high school teachers for the poor problem-solving skills they may see in students. Bernstein says student shortcomings stem from the act, not the teachers.
For potential college students, the fallout of this deficit in critical thinking skills does not vanish once they graduate from high school. Teaching to pass the test does not prepare students for higher education, and No Child Left Behind can have dire consequences for students once they graduate high school.
School districts across the nation have focused on teaching students how to pass the tests, rather than teaching them basic problem-solving skills, because a failure to meet Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) can result in the loss of federal funding. 
If a school district doesn’t meet its AYP mark for two consecutive years, students can transfer to nearby school districts. 
If schools don’t meet the mark for six years, they risk being shut down or turned into charter schools.
Flaws aside, the No Child Left Behind Act came from the desire to properly educate all students. The act would serve school districts better if states did not threaten to shut a school down for failing to pass a certain percentage of students. 
Instead of requiring test score improvement, states could provide committees to evaluate AYP scores with a focus on improving the underlying education plan. For school districts with lower AYP scores, the committees could help teachers develop better curricula. Ideally, the committees would work with those school districts until their AYP scores reflected the state average.
But as it stands, the No Child Left Behind Act forces schools to compete for funding. It’s time to reform this flawed act and teach for the sake of education.
