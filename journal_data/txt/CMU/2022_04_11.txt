April 7: loss, at St. Louis, 9-0
April 9: loss, at St. Louis, 6-2
Week Record: 0-2
Season Record: 0-2
The Pirates opened their season against the St. Louis Cardinals and started their season out with a bang, losing 9-0 on Thursday and 6-2 on Saturday. It was Pittsburgh’s worst Opening Day showing in at least the past 50 years. Yet despite their horrendous performance, there were some indications that the Pirates might have some reason to hope in the future.
To clarify: the “future” is not this season. This year’s Pirates are going to be bad, and there is the chance that they are going to be very, very bad. They won’t get near .500. They’ll probably lose 90 games, and there’s a very real possibility that they lose 100. In all likelihood, Pittsburgh will finish dead last in the division; they may even finish last in the league. 
That being said, we shouldn’t expect the Pirates to lose by nine every game like they did in their showing on Thursday; their luck was egregious. The Cardinals’ first run got on base only because of a gust of wind that turned a routine fly ball to shallow left field into a double; of the three St. Louis home runs that followed, one bounced off the top of the wall and one dropped into the very first row of seats past it. In the end, the Cardinals managed eight hits to the Pirates’ six. The Pirates deserved to lose this game, but it wasn’t quite as bad as the scoreline indicated.
Saturday was another heartbreaker. Watching the game and even looking back at the box score, it isn’t immediately evident why the Pirates lost. The pitching staff allowed ten hits, but the offense produced nine of their own. St. Louis starter Miles Mikolas was chased from the game midway through the fourth inning after throwing an astounding 77 pitches, but the Pirates pulled starter and potential breakout player Mitch Keller after just four, too. Pittsburgh’s fielding was characteristically terrible (Cole Tucker dropped a fly ball that was dubiously scored as a double), but the main issue was that when it mattered, when there were men on second or third, the Cardinals came through, and the Pirates choked.
There were some gems hidden in the Pirates’ terrible start. Wil Crowe came in from the bullpen to relieve JT Brubaker in the fourth, and recorded two hitless innings before being pulled. Yoshi Tsutsugo went two-for-three at the plate on Thursday, two-for-four on Saturday, and knocked in a pair of runs. Ke’Bryan Hayes, a candidate for a Gold Glove at third base this season, made a nice play to catch a sliding runner at the plate, scored a run purely on scrappy baserunning, and notched two hits of his own.
But overall, it was a rough start to the season for a Pirates fan. This team will win games, but it’ll lose a lot more. It’s April. The season almost surely ends, for this ballclub, in September. Hopefully next week we’ll have some wins to write about, but buckle up — it’s going to be a long year.

Dwayne Haskins, 24, who had just re-signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers last month after serving as a reserve last season, was struck and killed by a dump truck early Saturday morning while crossing a South Florida highway.
In an emailed statement to ESPN, Florida Highway Patrol spokesperson Lt. Indiana Miranda said that Haskins “was attempting to cross the westbound lanes of Interstate 595 when there was oncoming traffic.” Haskins was pronounced dead at the scene. According to the Florida Highway Patrol, he had been “walking on the highway for unknown reasons,” and the case is “an open traffic homicide investigation.”
Haskins was signed by the Steelers in the 2021 offseason after finishing third in the Heisman Trophy race in 2018 while playing for Ohio State and subsequently being drafted in the first round of the 2019 NFL Draft (the No. 15 pick overall) by the Washington Commanders. In March of 2022, a one-year restricted free agent tender, he hoped to become a starter in the NFL.
Haskins had traveled to South Florida with other Steelers quarterbacks, running backs, and wide receivers to train.
Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said in a statement, “[Dwayne Haskins] quickly became part of our Steelers family upon his arrival in Pittsburgh and was one of our hardest workers, both on the field and in our community. Dwayne was a great teammate, but even more so a tremendous friend to so many. I am truly heartbroken. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Kalabrya, and his entire family during this difficult time.”
Daniel and Tanya Snyder, the owners of the Washington Commanders, said Haskins had “a tremendous amount of potential who had an infectious personality. To say we are heartbroken is an understatement. Our hearts and prayers are with the members of Dwayne's family and all of those who knew him and loved him.”
Commanders coach Ron Rivera expressed, “Dwayne was a talented young man who had a long life ahead of him. This is a very sad time and I am honestly at a loss for words. I know I speak for the rest of our team in saying he will be sorely missed. Our entire team is sending our heartfelt condolences and thoughts and prayers to the Haskins family at this time.”
The Steelers tweeted, “We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Dwayne Haskins. May he rest in peace.” The NFL tweeted, “the NFL family mourns the tragic loss of Dwayne Haskins and we extend our deepest condolences to his family and loved ones.”
Haskins would have turned 25 next month.

After Raceday 2020 was canceled due to the pandemic and Raceday 2021 was held in a modified format with a limited number of Buggy teams, many teams were excited for Raceday 2022. Though teams were ready to return to the asphalt to vie for the title of this year’s Buggy champions, one obstacle still stood in their way: the weather.
In an attempt to avoid the forecasted rain, the preliminary races were pushed to 7:30 a.m. on April 8 instead of the planned 8:30 a.m. time. Additionally, gun-to-gun times were shortened to eight minutes instead of 10 to allow more heats to run before it started raining. 
The first timed heat of the day was the Joanne Memorial exhibition, named in honor of former Apex driver Joanne Tsai. Tsai passed away in 2020 after losing her battle with leukemia, which she had been fighting for almost a year.
Following the exhibition race, the first women’s heat started with Apex C in Lane 1 and SPIRIT C in Lane 2. A total of 10 heats were run between 7:50 a.m. and 9:10 a.m. In heat 3 of the women’s races, Fringe B had to hit the brakes shortly after the Hill 2 push-off to avoid making a pass. Due to a shortage of spring rolls, Sweepstakes had removed the requirement that drivers must have performed a pass test to drive on Raceday. As a result, drivers were advised to brake rather than to pass. Due to similar up-and-over times, the two Buggies got too close to each other and Fringe B chose to brake. 
The rest of the heats went without a hitch. A few teams, however, did receive disqualifications. SDC A violated the 5 Second Rule, meaning someone (other than the Hill 1 pusher) was too close to the Buggy when the countdown reached five seconds left. Their time of 2:34.40 would have earned them first place. CIA A failed the Drop Brake Test and CIA B also broke the 5 Second Rule. SDC B was disqualified due to a roster change. Here are the top six times from the preliminaries:
Following a short break, the men’s heats began. Starting off in heat 1 was SAE A in lane 1 and PiKA C in lane 2. The ensuing heats went fairly smoothly until after heat 8, when there was a brief delay due to weather. When weather conditions seemed to have improved, Fringe B (women's division) were granted a reroll due to them having braked to avoid a pass during the women's races. Heat 9 was then cleared to start rolling, but during the race, it started to rain heavily. This resulted in a spin from SPIRIT A; SPIRIT A and Apex B were given rerolls later in the day once weather conditions had improved.
Despite getting a reroll, Spirit A was still disqualified with a lane violation. PiKA B was also disqualified due to a lane violation; PiKA C was disqualified for breaking the 5 Second Rule. SDC B once again was disqualified due to a roster change. SigEp A faced disqualification after failing the Drop Break Test and Fringe A was disqualified for loss of mass (this means a part of the buggy came off during the race.) CIA B was disqualified for their Hill 3 to Hill 4 transition occurring outside the transition zone. The top six teams are as follows: 
Following the main rolls, a series of exhibition rolls took place. Notably, there was a CIA 50 exhibition team. This year, CIA are celebrating their 50th anniversary of buggy and completed a roll with around 40-50 pushers on the course. 
Finals were originally scheduled the following day to begin at 8:30 a.m. with a gun-to-gun time of 10 minutes. However, the start time had to be pushed back due to the course being wet from overnight rain. Buggies cannot race on wet roads due to loss of traction, meaning an increased risk of buggies spinning out or crashing. Despite efforts from the teams, Sweepstakes and the Buggy Alumni Association (BAA) had to wait out the rain, persistent sprinkling, and continually wet roads, as well as predictions of more rain, resulting in Day 2 of Raceday 2022 being canceled at 10:03 a.m. As such, in accordance with the Sweepstakes Bylaws, the times for the preliminary rolls were used to determine the winners of this year’s Raceday.
SPIRIT A claimed first in the women’s division. This is the first time since 1998 that SPIRIT has won (in either men’s and women’s); the last time that SPIRIT were the women’s division champions was in 1997. This also breaks SDC’s four-year winning streak in the women’s division, and marks the first time a team other than SDC and CIA has won the women’s division champions in the past decade. SDC A claimed victory in the men’s division, extending their winning streak across an entire decade, having won the men’s division since 2012. Additionally, SPIRIT A’s Maame Conduah was crowned Queen of the Hill and SDC A’s Clayton Edwards was crowned King of the Hill at the awards ceremony on April 9.
The Design Competition awards were also presented during the ceremony. CIA’s Kingfisher took first, CIA’s Roadrunner took second, and Fringe’s Burnout took third. Burnout also took home the People’s Choice award. Apex took home the Tom Wood Spirit of Buggy award, while DG took home the Anne Witchner Chairman’s Choice award. SigNu earned themselves the title of Most Improved and DG won the T-shirt design contest for buggy this year. Fringe chairman James Wong took home the title of Chair of the Year.
Although Raceday 2022 closed out prematurely due to the weather causing finals to be canceled, teams were finally able to celebrate Buggy 100 with a traditional raceday after two long years. Of course, teams will also look to next year to hopefully fully experience the thrill of a two-day prelims-finals raceday.

CMU RESEARCH: Ph.D. students compete in Three Minute Thesis competition
Eight doctoral students competed in Carnegie Mellon's Three Minute Thesis competition on March 30, which challenges participants to present their highly technical and sometimes years-long research to a general audience in under three minutes. First place went to Piyumi Wijesekara in biomedical engineering, second place to Suzy Li in architecture, and third place to Emma Benjaminson in mechanical engineering. The audience choice award went to Mohammad Ayaz Masud in electrical and computer engineering, and the alumni choice award went to Amaranth Karra in materials science and engineering.
CMU RESEARCH: Another way to move for people with paralyzed muscles
Patients that have paralyzed limbs sometimes require robotic limbs to assist their movements. But it is difficult to control robotic limbs: voice controls and joysticks have difficulty translating intentions for movement into instructions for a robot, and brain-computer interfaces require complex and expensive surgery. Professor of Mechanical Engineering Doug Weber and the Neuroscience Institute partnered with an international group of institutions to research an alternative method to control limbs using myoelectric signals. Myoelectric signals are electric pulses caused by muscles contracting. The team found that even if patients had paralyzed limbs, just attempting movement generates myoelectric signals. The team anticipates that this could make it a lot easier for patients to use robotic limbs and other assistive devices.
SCIENCE: A magnetic slime robot that could wiggle through digestive systems
Imagine a dark brownish-green goop that can move, encircle objects, deform itself, and even self-heal when broken. This is the magnetic slime robot that researchers in Hong Kong have created, announced in a paper published on April 1 (though the researchers insist that it is not an April Fools joke). The slime is made of neodymium magnet particles, borax and polyvinyl alcohol, which allows it to sometimes behave as a liquid, sometimes a solid, just like cornstarch and water. The slime's magnetism allows the researchers to control its movements using a magnetic field. The researchers envision that the slime could be used to travel through the digestive system and grab objects that were accidentally swallowed, for instance to encapsulate a small battery, preventing toxic electrolytes from leaking out into the digestive system. However, they emphasize that this is project is for research purposes; they currently have no intentions of testing it out on patients, as the slime itself is toxic and requires a stable protective coating that they have yet to implement.
SCIENCE: Scientists finally sequence the entire human genome
You may have heard of the Human Genome Project, a government funded effort running from 1990 to 2003 to sequence the entire human genome, and they did sequence the entire genome. Or at least most of it. While fairly successful, the researchers were unable to sequence about eight percent of the genome, equivalent to 200 million bases, due to technological limitations. In six papers published in Science, the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Consortium has been able to correct issues with the first sequencing and fill in its gaps, leaving 10 million bases unknown. They used several sequencing technologies, such as a nanopore device and a sequencer.
T2T believes their work is not over. They'd like to sequence complete genomes from a more diverse group of people to see the variations in the DNA which could influence disease and traits. This could be more challenging since, unlike their initial genome, they don't have identical pairs of chromosomes.
TECH: r/place comes to an end for 2022
For April Fools Day this year, Reddit revived a social experiment from 2017 April Fools Day called Place. Place was a large image in the r/place subreddit active from April 1 to April 5, and each Reddit user can place one pixel of color onto this image, then must wait five to 20 minutes until placing another. What results is Reddit community members collaborating with each other, and against other communities, to occupy different regions of the image. Reddit reports that over 10.4 million users placed down tiles, with over 16 million tiles placed, and at its peak had over 1.7 million users placing 5.9 million tiles. Notable images in Place include many country flags (including Canada's flag, which at some point transitioned to a banana flag), many fandom posters, and tiny Among Us characters blending in with the shadows of other communities. Communities outside of Reddit also contributed, with Twitch streamers mobilizing their fans to pitch in, or in the case of XQC, to overwrite as many pixels with black as possible. Toward the end of r/place, the only color users could place down was white, and users watched as the entire board was erased.
Reddit has released a lot of information on r/place: other than the statistics earlier, they also have CSV datasets on tile placements, open-source code of 2017 r/place in Github, and information on how they built r/place in 2017. It is also notable that the first version of r/place in 2017 was conceived by John Wardle, creator of the popular "Wordle" game now owned by the New York Times.

‘Kingdom Hearts IV,’ ‘Missing-Link’ announced
The “Kingdom Hearts” franchise will make its return later this year following announcements during the series' 20th Anniversary Event on April 10. During the event, three main updates were shared, the first of which will be released later this year.
“Kingdom Hearts Dark Road” is a mobile game that is centered around the backstory of Xehanort, the main antagonist of the previous entries of Kingdom Hearts. The game was originally supposed to receive its final update at the end of September 2021 but was delayed and was supposed to be available in the following winter. It was delayed once again “due to a major scenario addition.” During the 20th Anniversary Event, developers announced that the final update of the game will launch in August 2022.
Kingdom Hearts will also receive another mobile game entry,  “Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link,” starting later this year. The game appears to take place following the events of the franchise’s previous mobile game, “Kingdom Hearts Union χ," which closed last year. Unlike the old game, though, the new one seems to feature more of an open world and 3D graphics.
The final announcement was the development of “Kingdom Hearts IV.” No release date has been announced yet, and the trailer ended with “Magic in the Making.” Something to note, however, is the several differences present in the trailer. The Kingdom Hearts logo has taken on a different appearance than it has in past entries. Additionally, the graphics of the game (at least with the main character, Sora) seem to resemble Final Fantasy games more so than previous Kingdom Hearts entries, which may be a hint of what is to come. 
Unreal Engine 5.0 becomes available to all developers
In an announcement during the “State of Unreal 2022” presentation on April 5, Unreal Engine 5.0 (UE5) is now publicly available for game developers. The game engine, which is developed by Epic Games, was previously only available in Early Access and Preview releases.
UE5 now has some updated features that weren’t included in previous versions of the game engine. This includes Nanite and Lumen, features that aim to bring an “incredibly realistic interactive experience to life.” Additionally, there will be tools for developers to create massive open worlds and also introduced new ways for creators to speed up the creative process.
Alongside the public release of the game engine, Epic Games also released two sample projects for developers to look at: the Lyra Start Game and a City Sample from a project being developed using UE5, “The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience.” Over 85 studios have confirmed the development of projects using Unreal Engine, according to a blog post from the company. 
‘Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga’ releases
Releasing on April 5 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, “Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga” is the sixth “Lego Star Wars” game developed by Traveller’s Tales; it was also published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The game covers story from all nine “Star Wars” films, and will additionally feature characters from other “Star Wars” properties later on as downloadable content.
Upon release, the game received generally favorable reviews from critics — review aggregator has the PlayStation 5 version scoring 83 from 51 critic reviews and averaging a score of 8.8 from user reviews. Many reviews highlight that it takes what has worked in previous Lego games and adds its own flavor, including a more open-world experience than other entries and stunning graphics.
The game was met with much success compared to previous Lego games, at least on Steam. Following its launch, “Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga” broke the previous concurrent user record for a Lego game on Steam by more than 1,200%, getting just over 80,000 users at once. The previous record-holder was “Lego Marvel Super Heroes,” which hit close to 6,000 concurrent users eight years ago. 
Activision Blizzard announces QA testers will be full-time
Activision Blizzard made an announcement this past week that all those working as temporary or contract quality assurance (QA) workers for the company in the United States will become full-time employees starting July 1. This also includes a wage boost for most of these workers when the minimum hourly rate for the position goes up to $20 per hour starting April 17. Currently, Activision Blizzard has around 1,100 and converting them to full time employees will raise its total number of full-time employees by nearly 25 percent. 
This announcement has come after an attempt at unionization from QA workers at Raven Software, which is owned by Activision Blizzard. If the workers at Raven Software do succeed, they would be the first union at a AAA gaming company in North America. They have filed for a union election through the National Labor Relations Board; Activision Blizzard has stated that the decision to hire all its QA workers full-time has nothing to do with unionization attempts by its employees.
Separately, Microsoft is currently in the process of acquiring Activision Blizzard in a historic $68.7 billion deal. If the union from Raven Software QA workers does succeed, Microsoft has stated they will honor their choice to be represented by a labor organization. Activision Blizzard was sued by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing last year following accusations of discrimination and “frat-boy culture” in its offices. Most recently, the company was ordered to pay a settlement of $18 million in response to its federal sexual harassment case.
‘Fortnite’ raises $144 million for humanitarian relief
In late March, Epic Games announced that they were committing all its “Fortnite” proceeds between March 20 and April 3 to humanitarian relief for those affected by war in Ukraine. Xbox also joined in on Epic Games’ efforts. The main charities funds were going to include Direct Relief, United Nations Children’s Fund, United Nations World Food Programme, The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and World Central Kitchen. This past week, the company announced that a total of $144 million was raised and thanked everyone who contributed.

Hello Goobers. I'm sure all of you were boozing and cruising the entirety of last week, and are now winding down from the GREATEST WEEK OF YOUR LIFE! If any of this wasn't true for you, that sucks. To continue the fabulous week that we're sure you all had, we have built the ultimate PILLBOX issue. It's got everything your hearts could ever desire (if you love reading fine articles, of course). PILLBOX's old guard has come back in full force here, as we have used all of our connections to bring back the Cabal of Power Writers from last semester's issues. 
Stormin' Sujay: His typewriter lies heavy, a crown adorning his head. This intellectual titan has written over 120 articles for The Tartan, and plans to write at least 120 more. For today's issue he's gone bonkers, and released a full dissertation on a very important movie.
Naked Nate: After the heavy toll incurred from Bisexual Superman, Nate returns to PILLBOX with a fresh mind and strips RENT bare with whip hot takes and obtuse political commentary. 
Audacious Anna: Never one to let an album go unreviewed, Anna drops a knowledge bomb on all Jon Batiste haters, and still has enough time to design half of PILLBOX. Her design skills matched only by her listening skills, musicians live in fear of receiving one of her legendary negative reviews.
Zesty Zachary: We'll never really know where his inspirations come from, but when they do, he sure can write! Having written some of PILLBOX's many articles, Zach inspires with his ability to crank out a piece of writing on any topic at any time of night or day.
Also Cole wrote.
We truly hope you enjoy this week's collection of art and writing covering topics within and beyond Carnival. Know that the PILLBOX team probably had a way better time than you did and if you want to have just as good of a time you should consider contributing to our future editions via the form linked on the back side of this issue. 
Much love,
your editors, yadayadaya

After a long day of being a teenager and listening to the same indie songs with the same drum beats and the same untrained vocals, Jon Batiste’s "WE ARE" wasn’t just a breath of fresh air. It was an oxygen tank. I’d heard of Batiste and heard a couple of pieces off the album, but hearing the whole thing together made a part of me come alive that I didn’t know was dead. Something about it reminded me of my own concept of “real” music. It was big band and it was soft jazz and it was classical and it was gospel and it was serious and original but also a perfect 2021-style callback to the 1960’s and 70’s eras of black artists. 
"WE ARE" was this year’s Grammy-award winner for Album of the Year, but the artist and songs from the album were nominated for an overall total of 11 awards — the most of any artist at the Grammys this year. Batiste already made headlines this year as well, with an Oscar for his work on “Soul.” While working for The Atlantic, the National Jazz Museum, his own projects, and playing on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” with his band Stay Human, Batiste has redefined what it means to be a musician on today’s stages.
"I don't even think genre exists," the Juilliard-educated artist told the Recording Academy. Truly, his backgrounds as a classically trained pianist as well as a drummer for his family’s funk-soul band are equally apparent in much of his work, with "WE ARE" being no exception. Batiste is what one might call a musician's musician, with his focus solely on the work and the vibes. He wrote and performed the majority of "WE ARE," including instrumentals. "What's deep is that God gave us 12 notes. It's the same 12 notes Duke Ellington had, Bach had. It's the same 12 Nina Simone (had)," he proclaimed while accepting his Oscar last month.
Whatever it is about Batiste — his education, his background, or his personal values — that make his music award-winning was shown off in a special way on "WE ARE." The songs speak from a level that is somehow deeply personal and yet so simple. Tracks like “CRY”, “SING”, and “SHOW ME THE WAY” shed light on emotional experiences that are so succinct and general that they can’t help but be relatable. “SHOW ME THE WAY” in particular talks about listening to your favorite music to help get you through hard times, something almost all of us do. Yet anyone who knows Batiste’s story knows that these simple songs might not be so simple, as his wife Suleika Jaouad has been battling leukemia for a number of years.
Besides its stunning emotional scale, "WE ARE" amazes in its diverse musical range, which includes rap on “WATCHUTALKINBOUT," classical piano on “MOVEMENT 11," and a surprisingly musical theater feel on a few of the early songs. Like any good, modern album, it has one of those 20 or 30 second tracks with a vocal snippet about some deep truth about life. It has a poppy Target-commercial hit, “FREEDOM” which also hints at notes of social and racial commentary, similarly to the title track “WE ARE” (opening line, “The ghetto is full of stars”). In short, "WE ARE," like Batiste himself, has it all, even coming-of-age songs with “ADULTHOOD” and “BOY HOOD.”
Like with any media award show, people will speculate about how decisions are made behind the scenes of the Grammys. The Album of the Year category hosted a wide selection of star nominees, from Tony Bennet to Kanye West to Lil Nas X. Considering its lack of media coverage, "WE ARE" seemed like an unlikely pick for the award, but I think the win was not only well deserved, but needed. Batiste is a black composer with a strong repertoire, and the album offered so much in the way of talent that some others, while popular, might not have. The award spurred a surge of listeners that might not otherwise have listened to this whimsical, jazz motivated, throwback record.
[End note: I know that only Taylor Swift really talks about this kind of stuff, but I couldn’t help but notice an interesting anomaly in my research on Batiste. He received 11 Grammy nominations this year. He switched from drums to piano — his main instrument and the impetus for his interest in composing — when he was 11. The seventh track on "WE ARE" is called “MOVEMENT 11’”.]

This review talks about war crimes and atrocities in detail, so if you're sensitive to that, here's your warning.
The Horrors and Heroes of War
The phrase “horrors of war” gets thrown around often in descriptions of war movies. War is hell. War is evil. War is not good for anyone. There is an underlying theme for many war movies, perhaps all of them: heroism. Heroism has many different contexts and is definitionally broad. You can be considered a hero for brewing the perfect cup of coffee on a rainy morning. Or you can be a hero making the sacrifice to fight for your country or the greater good. But what is the parameter by which we define greater good? Are the soldiers of imperialist countries heroic for their willingness to carry out a state’s imperialist objectives? If your home is the one being invaded and that forces you and other innocent people around you to have to defend themselves with violence in return, is that heroic? To take that even further, is it heroic to be forced to fight a war just so your nation or people can continue to exist? 
Heroes do exist in times of war. Those who go above and beyond the call of duty to put their lives on the line to defend their loved ones and their comrades in arms are heroes. The most human thing to do is to have compassion for those around us, and to continue to do that despite the death and destruction of war is heroic. But there isn’t anything inherently heroic about war, or the duty of being a soldier itself. If anything, cultural obsessions with heroism can be and often are used to feed the desire for preserving or expanding symbolic and physical power, which is a main driver of war. Even if people are inherently against war and violence conceptually, no one has a grasp on those conditions until they see them for themselves. Once they do, survivors would rather be dead than have to live with those painful memories for the rest of their lives. No film captures this bleak reality more than Elem Klimov’s 1985 anti-war film, “Come and See."
Capturing the Horror
It is hard to describe just why “Come and See” has the reputation of bleakness the way it does, so to understand, let’s compare it to a few other World War II period movies that have a similar reputation of being difficult to watch: “Schindler’s List” and “Saving Private Ryan.”
“Schindler’s List” focuses on the story of German industrialist and Nazi party member Oskar Schindler, who overcomes his profit seeking nature to try to save the lives of Jewish people forced to work in his factories. The movie focuses heavily on the cost of genocide and the value of standing up to the perpetrators of genocide. “Saving Private Ryan” follows a regiment of soldiers led by former English teacher Captain Miller who has to save the last surviving son of the Ryan family after his brothers are killed in the war. It focuses very heavily on the brutality of combat, the ephemerality of life on the battlefield, and the value of life itself. 
Though both Spielberg movies show the horrors of war and that there are no winners, they both reaffirm the notion of heroism. Both movies offer emotional catharsis by their respective ends. The movies don’t sugarcoat the characters, since the characters aren’t perfect or necessarily good people. Private Ryan, Captain Miller and his regiment, and Oskar Schindler faced the horrors of war, and they are loved and remembered for the sacrifices they made to save whoever they could. “Saving Private Ryan” adds a little dose of patriotism in its final shot of the American flag, reminding the audience how hundreds of thousands of Americans died during those dark times so that the flag can wave proudly today. 
On the other hand, “Come and See'' doesn't show the horrors of war. The horror is the war. Unlike most war movies, we are not presented with a war story. We are presented with a surreal psychological horror story about someone in a nightmarish reality. The main character is not a German industrialist who saves Jewish people in the Holocaust or a group of soldiers saving a fellow comrade in arms. The main character is an innocent, helpless child named Flyora, who lives in a small village in Belorussia. In 1943, Flyora and another young boy dig up abandoned SVT-40 rifles in sand trenches to join the Soviet partisan fighters during the German occupation of Eastern Europe, much to the chagrin of Flyora’s village elder. A German FW 189 reconnaissance aircraft silently watches the young children. 
Flyora’s story offers no catharsis of any kind, nor does it reaffirm patriotic sentiments or heroism in its final moments. Instead, there is a title card that reads “628 Belorussian villages were burnt to the ground with all their inhabitants,” followed by a shot of Soviet partisan fighters marching through the woods to their next battle. There is no heroism. Only death, violence, and more death.
The Myth of the Heroic Soldier
“Come and See'' falls in the category of war movies that explore the relationship between war and the human psyche and condition. There are many well-known war movies that fall into this category, including “The Bridge on the River Kwai”, “Apocalypse Now,” “Full Metal Jacket,” “Grave of the Fireflies,” “Platoon,” “Jarhead” and, most recently, “Dunkirk.” Each of these films focus on different themes. “The Bridge on the River Kwai” was one of the first war movies that addressed the myth of heroism in war and the follies of the men who seek honor through warfare and violence. “Apocalypse Now,” “Platoon,” “Full Metal Jacket,” and “Jarhead” all delve much more deeply into the psychological impact of war on the characters, the insanity of war, how it scars soldiers, and how being a soldier is not the heroic position people assume it to be. “Dunkirk” is more akin to a survival horror film, with sparse dialogue, nameless characters, and a constant sense of doom. “Grave of the Fireflies” (which deserves its own article) is based on the true story of an older brother trying to care for his younger sister after they are orphaned following the Tokyo fire bombings, a bleak story where innocence is torn away from children too soon. “Come and See” captures all of these themes at once with Flyora’s tragic nightmare.
Throughout the movie, there is a recurring motif of close up shots of people’s faces to capture their emotions in a singular moment. When he is first conscripted by Russian partisans and taken to their training camp, we see close up shots of Flyora, excited to go off to fight against the German soldiers invading his home. The partisan soldiers conscripting Flyora are off-putting men who try to play peekaboo with Flyora’s younger sisters, but end up making them cry instead. In the meantime, Flyora’s mother is frantically begging for her son not to be taken off to war. 
When he arrives at the training camp, it’s not what he expects it to be. He’s not taken into combat immediately, and there is an air of mania that pervades the mood at the camp, a combination of fear, trauma, madness, and absurdity. He meets a girl named Glasha, and the two of them bond over this mania, frolicking through the forest and relaxing at the camp before it is suddenly bombed. The tone of the mania has changed as Flyora goes into shell shock, is partially deafened by the bombs, and hides from German soldiers. 
The movie constantly keeps you in Flyora’s state of mind. Everything feels present yet unreal at the same time. The characters are larger than life and very distinct, as they pop out of the frame with the way the camera is focused and the dialogue delivery doesn’t seem to match the facial movements shown by the actors on screen. At the same time, the film uses natural lighting in its filming and isn’t hyper-stylized with its camera movements to make the war look like a spectacle. The sound design is made to overload viewers' senses the way a soldier would be overloaded in war. After the camp is bombed, the audio quality becomes increasingly worse to put you further into Flyora’s state of mind. You see what he sees and hear what he hears. The score heightens this with a combination of low droning noises, classical music, and opera to create more dread and madness. 
Worrying for the safety of his family, he and Glasha head back to Flyora’s village, only to find it abandoned. It is clear what has happened, but a still shell-shocked Flyora is convinced that his family is hiding on an island across the bog near his village. He runs off without looking back, with Glasha in pursuit. Glasha then looks back at the village and sees the ugly truth: a stack of naked bodies crudely piled up behind a house. Flyora drags himself and Glasha through the muddy bog, only to find the island empty. Glasha yells at him, saying his family is dead and he is going insane, which causes Flyora to try and drown her. A partisan fighter, Ruzebh, intervenes, and takes Flyora and Glasha to a group of villagers who survived the Nazi Schutzstaffel (SS) paramilitary death squads. Amongst them is Flyora’s village elder, who was burned alive by the SS. He confirms that he witnessed Flyora’s family get executed and begged them to stop. Instead of comforting Flyora, he chastises him for digging up the rifle and joining the partisans. Flyora tries to kill himself out of grief, but is stopped by Glasha and the other villagers. 
The rest of the film feels like it will then play out more like a conventional war movie, with sequences of intense combat and violence. Flyora’s long, soft hair is cut off and he heads off with Ruzebh and two other partisans to search for supplies and food. But the other two partisans are killed in a minefield, and Ruzebh is killed by a German machine gun in an open field after he and Flyora steal a cow from an occupied town. The cow is also killed. The next day, Flyora tries to steal a horse, but the farmer he tries to steal from has to protect him from an SS unit. There’s no elaborate or complex firefight. It’s just machine guns in the distance from an enemy Flyora can’t see or even fight back against. 
The myth of heroism in war is especially apparent in the portrayal of combat in stories of war. This is the most common way heroism is portrayed in stories centered on war and battle for thousands of years, like the stories of Achilles and Hercules. Heroes in battle were virtuous, and those heroes were the ones who would lead their people to victory or save them when they were attacked. These stories are morale boosters, necessary optimism and positivity that helps guide people in a world filled with chaos and bloodshed and reminds us that goodness exists within our hearts in dark times.
But those are often stories written by those who feel they can hold the same virtue in the face of such darkness or are written by those propagandizing war as a necessary tool that can be virtuous for a narrowly defined set of “right reasons.” The majority of war stories are like Flyora’s. The morning after he is shot at, he ends up at a village with the help of the man he tried stealing from earlier. Flyora tries to fulfill his duty as an honorable soldier. He warns the villagers to leave but not before the SS arrive with the help of collaborators from the Russian Liberation Army. He is unable to get them to evacuate to their safety. 
What follows is one of the most horrific sequences ever put to film, and is based on stories from survivors of the genocide on the Eastern front. Flyora and the entire village is rounded up into a barn by the SS, where they tell the villagers that they may leave but only if they leave their children behind. Flyora escapes, since he is not associated with the village and can’t help them. One woman tries to escape with her child, but she is quickly stopped by the SS and dragged away by her hair while her child is thrown back into the barn through the window. The SS then burn the barn down with Molotovs before opening fire at the barn as it burns with the trapped villagers screaming inside. The only survivors are Flyora, who is held at gunpoint as the SS takes a picture with him in front of the burning barn; and a bedridden old woman, who is left in the middle of the burning village. 
Flyora wanders, unable to process. He sees that a group of partisans attacked and killed most of the SS brigade who burned the village. He joins them as the partisans take prisoners, including the brigade’s commander and junior officer, and a few Russian Liberation Army collaborators. Flyora watches as a partisan named Kosach gets the Russian collaborators to beg for their lives. The SS commander begs too, but the more extreme junior officer tells the Eastern European partisans that their nation doesn’t deserve to exist. A torch bearer runs down the road. Kosach looks at Flyora, who gives the Russian collaborators a jerry can to dump on top of the German soldiers while they beg to be spared. The partisans are unable to stand much more and shoot them to put them all out of their misery. The torch bearer arrives just as they shoot, and dejectedly tosses the torch in a puddle. As they leave, Flyora stumbles upon a painting of Hitler. He stands there, watching, and aims his gun. 
Facing History
Francois Truffaut once spoke in an interview about the difficulty of portraying violence in movies. Truffaut said that he found filmmakers used violence in an ambiguous fashion, and war movies end up becoming “pro-war” even if they claim to be anti-war. On the other hand, Stephen Spielberg addressed criticism of the portrayal of war in “Saving Private Ryan” by stating that every war movie is anti-war, whether it’s good or bad. Neither of these statements are untrue. 
It is important for us to connect with our history. Reading it can only have so much of an impact. But visuals and sounds stick with us, and that can have a great effect. “Saving Private Ryan” and “Apocalypse Now” both have incredibly realistic portrayals of combat, with the former film causing veterans to relive their own horrific memories of combat. However, the drawback is that the visual presentation can unknowingly glorify certain elements of war without meaning to do so. “Apocalypse Now” was very anti-war, but there were many sequences that looked really cool and that is what is remembered the most by the audience.
Klimov, however, did not emphasize any spectacle. This was his final film, which he co-wrote with writer Ales Adromovich. Adromovich himself experienced the same nightmare Flyora did when he was a child in World War II. Both wanted the Soviet youth of the 1980s to remain connected with the brutality and suffering endured by their parents and grandparents during the war, but were blocked by Soviet censors for years due to the extreme realism of the film. The film was shot over nine months, and Flyora’s actor, Alexei Kravchenko, was put on a starvation diet so he could look skinnier for the end of the movie. Real bombs and guns were used, and the cow in the film was actually killed. Klimov was so concerned for the effects of the movie on Kravchenko that he wanted the young actor to undergo hypnosis so he wouldn’t have psychological trauma from the filming. Klimov checked in with all the actors years after the filming as well. 
But Klimov’s most powerful use of imagery is at the end of the movie, where he explicitly connects the film with reality. As Flyora points the gun at the painting of Hitler, we see images of emaciated bodies and destruction. He fires the gun once. Suddenly, all the footage starts reversing. He fires the gun again. There is footage of planes flying and warfare all in reverse. Flyora keeps firing. He hopes to reverse the course of history and stop the war from happening, and the pace of the footage reversing becomes more frantic. He fires again. We see pre-1939 footage, with Nazi rallies and Hitler’s speeches. We keep going further back, seeing how easy it was for people to be manipulated by Hitler and his rapid rise to power. He fires again. We see the economic destitution of Germany and book burnings. He fires again. We see the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which effectively blamed World War I on Germany and is considered by some historians to be the start of World War II. He fires the gun again. Then suddenly, the film shows Hitler as a child. Then it quickly cuts to an image of Hitler as a baby, sitting in his mother’s lap. Flyora stops firing and stares. The camera pans down, focusing on Hitler as a baby. 
This leads into the final question that Elem Klimov leaves for the audience:
Would you kill a madman before he became one?
Flyora just stares. He doesn’t fire another bullet at the thought of Hitler as a baby. He could kill Hitler as a baby if he wanted to. But that would come at the cost of whatever humanity Flyora has left. The only way to stop everything from happening would be to kill Hitler as a child, before Hitler himself knew and influenced the bleak reality of the world of which Flyora is now a part. The final close up shot is focused on Flyora’s face, caked in blood, grime, sweat, and tears. It cuts to a shot of the burning village, an image seared into his head forever, as Mozart’s “Lacrimosa” overtakes the anxiety-inducing sound design. It cuts back to him. He stops aiming his gun at the painting. Two final tears roll down his face as he makes direct eye contact with the camera. The boy at the beginning, full of life and innocence, no longer exists. He is a shell, a vessel of darkness, defeat, and grief. Then the title card: “628 Belorussian villages were burned to the ground with all their inhabitants.” Flyora catches up to his partisan comrades, and disappears amongst them, becoming just another story among millions. The camera pans up to the sky, perhaps looking for another reconnaissance aircraft or perhaps looking for the god that forsake them. 
“Come and See” refers to a bleak passage from Revelation 6 in the Bible, where one of the four beasts of the apocalypse invite John to watch the despair and desolation. It may seem like this film is too bleak to view, and it is very likely that after watching this, you will feel depressed and empty for hours. I certainly was. But it is important to watch. Artists don’t just make dark content for the sake of it. They hope that you see what they see and find some comfort that you’re not alone in the darkness. This was Klimov's final film, as he felt he had nothing left to say after making it.
As another war rages again in Eastern Europe, Klimov’s film remains relevant and is a reminder that we can’t be disconnected from the experiences of those who have suffered due to the violent aspirations of brutal politicians. Many in the Western world are tripping over themselves to assign Volodymyr Zelensky as a hero for simply doing his duty as a leader. But there is nothing heroic about having to fight for your nation’s right to simply exist, and this fight has been intrinsic to Eastern Europe for over a thousand years in a thousand ways. We can’t reverse the course of history, but we can always learn from those who have lived.

This article contains spoilers for "Shin Megami Tensei IV" and "Shin Megami Tensei V” 
After a new entry into the “Shin Megami Tensei” (SMT) series was teased in 2017, fans of the saga that anticipated a new game had to wait several years for more information following the announcement video published later that year. It wasn’t until November 2021 that fans finally got to experience that new game, “Shin Megami Tensei V” (SMTV).
The first game of the SMT series dates back to the days of the Super Famicom, but the entries are also part of a larger “universe” often referred to as “MegaTen.” The most notable series in MegaTen is “Persona,” which achieved international fame following the success of “Persona 5.” Most entries, including the “mainline” SMT games, are role playing games (RPGs) that take place in some sort of apocalyptic or post-apocalyptic setting. The mainline SMT games usually involve some conflict where the main character decides the fate of the world in the end, normally giving the player an option of chaos, order, or neutral. The series heavily draws from cultures and religions from around the world, whose creatures and gods serve as the main enemies in the franchise.
After finishing some of the entries of the Persona series a couple of years ago, I decided to dive into other MegaTen games, where I learned about the development of SMTV. Overall, I would say the gameplay is one of the best in RPG history, but the story leaves a lot to desire. 
The story of the game is straightforward; you play as a student attending Jouin High School alongside some of the other main characters of the game. After hearing about some unfortunate events, the main character finds himself in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo where he fuses with a demon and becomes a “Nahobino,” or one who has “Knowledge” and the body of a god. We later learn that this is the real Tokyo which was destroyed in the war between Lucifer and the God of Law. Lucifer claims he has slain The Creator during Armageddon, the war from 18 years. So far, nothing too unexpected.
We also learn that characters who become a Nahobino can climb The Throne of Creator. The God of Law, the previous holder of the throne, had removed the Knowledge from the rest of the gods, meaning no one could take the throne from him. But after his death, Nahobinos can return and the main character is proof of this. The rest of the story follows the story of “Bethel,” the forces trying to reclaim the real Tokyo. Eventually, after the reclamation of Tokyo, the various Bethel branches, headed by gods, try to take the Throne of Creation for themselves after locating the human who holds their Knowledge (spoiler: our classmates from the beginning of the story do).
The main problem with the story in my eyes is that it doesn’t drive anything, it simply just exists alongside the actual gameplay and nothing more. The alignment representatives don’t serve as anything but tools for the story to progress; they don’t feel like they belong in the game. This was perhaps the biggest disappointment for me given my experience with SMTIV, which has a really solid story in my opinion. I grew attached to the alignment representatives in SMTIV, and I actually felt bad when I inevitably had to kill them following my alignment choice. In SMTV, killing my “friends” felt like a means to progress the story. The character development was severely lacking and sometimes felt rushed. At times, the law representative’s story felt like it was reaching at best. 
I also briefly want to talk about the endings of the game. Upon my first playthrough, I got the “Neutral” ending, but was actually aiming for the “True Neutral” ending. I ended up ending a zone too early, which locked me out of the True Neutral ending even though I later completed all the requirements for it. The regular Neutral ending was lackluster, to say the least. It cuts out the final boss from the “Law” and “Chaos” endings and just feels wrong. With the little personality that the main character has, it just feels wrong for him to decide to destroy the Throne of Creation and nothing else. The next time I play, I plan on actually getting the True Neutral ending and I hope I’m not as disappointed as I was with my first ending. But also, it’s not the story that makes this game so good: it’s the design and gameplay.
SMTV is the first entry in the series that has a completely open overworld with overworld encounters, and it’s executed phenomenally. The models and behaviors of the demons are especially solid and definitely a right step for the series. While I did like the pixelated demons in battle of the SMT 3DS games, the SMTV models take it another level. I was really glad to see the return of Chironnupu, my favorite demon who first appeared in SMTIV:A, alongside some other inspiring character designs. Fallen Abdiel has got to be one of my favorite designs out of the new demons introduced, and Loup-Garou deserves an honorable mention. I would also be remiss not to mention how good some of the demon redesigns are; I much prefer the new version of Angel. 
The battle system is solid in SMTV, though I slightly preferred SMTIV:A’s system. In SMTV, light and dark elements go back to being damaging attributes that have a chance to insta-kill if the enemy is weak to that element, which I vastly prefer over them just having a chance to insta-kill, as it gives me a reason to use light/dark skills. Graphically speaking, all the skills have solid animations, especially the unique skills that some demons have, including the main character. Profaned Land having Demi-fiend’s iconic pose was a nice touch, along with smaller details like the ice Jack Frosts in Jack Bufula.
This time around, the main battle gimmick was “Matgatsuhi,” which allowed the user to use a special attack when the Magatsuhi gauge was full during battle. I enjoyed collecting the various Magatsuhi attacks my demons could use throughout the game, which was a nice reward for exploring and completing side missions. However, since SMTIV was my first SMT game, I think I’ll always have a soft spot for the “Smirk” mechanic introduced in those games.
The last part of combat I want to touch on is its difficulty. The series as a whole is known for being very challenging, but I felt SMTV was very fair. Every time I had a “game over,” I felt like it was my fault. The widespread availability of elemental attack items in the game also made it a bit easier than other entries. The initial boss in SMTV didn’t feel like I had to get lucky to beat it, which many people feel in regard to Minotaur or Medusa from SMTIV. Though occasionally I got roadblocked at a boss, I just explored around for a bit and did a little bit of grinding and I was able to beat the boss. (Note: I played the game on Normal difficulty).
Perhaps the most noteworthy part of the game is the gameplay itself. The introduction of an almost complete open world exploration is a fantastic addition to the game and made the game feel much more interactive. Though some people may not be fans of “collect-a-thon,” I had a good time collecting “Mimans,” which are little creatures scattered all over post-apocalyptic Tokyo. It’s completely optional, but you come across enough of them that you get enough “glory” to get enough skills.
Additionally, I liked the mix of character stat mechanics from Strange Journey and SMTIII. The reintroduction of demon sources was a welcome surprise that I wasn’t expecting. I will say I didn’t fully utilize this mechanic, as I had a lot of sources leftover at the end of the game. However, I think using the sources to determine both the main character’s skills and affinities, was a useful mechanic. There were many opportunities to get sources, so I didn’t feel like I was in a bind to new skills at any point.
I would highly recommend the game to anyone with interest in RPGs. You don’t have to play any of the other games in the series to understand the plot or appreciate anything the game has to offer. The main game is about 50 hours and earning 100 percent completion will involve about 95 hours; the game has plenty to offer and solid gameplay, so give it a chance!

As someone who hadn't actually seen "Rent," I was disappointed to learn that there's only one song about (not) paying rent.
Of course, "Rent" is a lot more than its title, and Scotch’n’Soda's performance of it was both a jam and a lament. The opening number, also called "Rent," rocked Rangos Ballroom as Mark (played by Luke Suddeth) and Roger (Nick Grosso) declared they would not pay rent to their roommate-turned-landlord, Benny (Clayton Edwards). Scotch’n’Soda’s performace lived up to the rock-and-roll that "Rent" is known for, but after that opening number, the musical took turns between celebration and mourning, hope and hopelessness, and life and death.
At its core, "Rent" focused on the unwinding of a group of friends due to the fallout of HIV and AIDS infections pushing them apart. Characters including Roger, Angel (Riley Santiago), and Mimi (Lisset Martinez) all have HIV or AIDS, and, in this musical set in the early 90s, it feels like a death sentence. Throughout the second act, as Angel and Mimi's conditions worsen and Roger grows increasingly distant, the characters return again and again to sing the musical's most famous song, "Seasons of Love." The musical continuously invokes the theme of measuring the time characters have left in love.
In Scotch’n’Soda's production, the actors created a lot of love amongst themselves. Whether romantic (in "Cover Me," about each couples' sex lives) or platonic (ganging up against Benny in "La Vie Bohème"), Scotch’n’Soda put together numbers that felt like the whole cast was singing as one. The major characters and the ensemble seemed to all pull in the same direction, and the crowd erupted into cheers during a number when the ensemble waved pride flags and danced in a circle. 
In terms of group numbers, Scotch’n’Soda's cast pulled together and formed a tight-knit, wonderful group. Many of the duets stood out, too: Suddeth and Vicky Walters (playing Joanne) were at once convincing and hilarious in "Tango: Maureen." Walters and Shaelyn Parker (as Maureen) were magnetic and worked the will-they-won't-they dynamic well in "Take Me or Leave Me." Quincy Eaton (playing Collins) delivered a standout performance loving, caring for, and mourning Santiago's Angel. 
Still, the musical was not without some hiccups. Perhaps because of the setup in Rangos, the characters were hard to hear at times and the volume of the microphones had to be constantly adjusted.
Although the cast showed off their pride in their performance, the musical hasn't been without controversy. An introduction in the program noted that Jonathon Larson's authorship of "Rent" was its own controversy. A collaborator who worked on the musical with him, Lynn Thomson, sued for royalties (she later settled with Larson's estate out of court). The introduction also notes that he borrowed stories from many of the LGBTQ+ people around him, including the author Sarah Schulman.
A cast member wrote to The Tartan before "Rent" opened voicing similar concerns. "I truly love the people working on this production and I am sure that it will be a good experience for many involved," they wrote. "I just hope that because of its mal-intentioned origin (once again emphasizing that “Rent” is the product of a white, cis, straight man's take on the work of a queer woman), the show doesn’t cause more harm than good to the communities we are trying to uplift."
As a member of the audience, Angel seemed less well-done than other LGBTQ+ characters of the show, which was not helped by the audio issues. I missed some of the dialogue and didn't even realize Angel was the same character who helped Collins at first. Angel and Collins didn't have the same chemistry that the other couples like Mimi and Roger or Maureen and Joanne did.
As for whether the musical succeeded in uplifting LGBTQ+ voices, I would hope so, but I'm not one to speak on it. Personally, I feel that the cast did a good job, but it takes the whole crew to do representation right.

My articles seem to have garnered a bit of renown in the journalistic world, which has led to some perks. Not only do I get invited to all the ultra secret coastal elite parties with Lena Dunham, Barbara Ehrenreich, Jia Tolentino, Thomas Frank, Joe Biden, etc…, but I also get access to some scoops that the average schmuck wouldn’t. I wouldn’t say I'm Woodward, but I’d definitely place myself above Bernstein. Anyways, this is all to explain the extraordinary scoop that has been entrusted on me by one of my loyal readers. I was working late in the Tartan office when I received a knock at the door. I rushed over, praying that someone new was finally interested in writing for the Tartan, but when I opened, there was nothing but the loud clacking sound of flip flops against linoleum ringing at the end of the hall. My dismayed self looked down at my very normal sized feet to see a letter emblazoned with a red N. I opened the envelope, excited that Netflix had greenlit my original romantic dramedy sitcom miniseries with highly GIF-able moments, but those nincompoops haven’t gotten back to me yet. Instead, it was the leaked scripts for the entirety of the Queen’s Gambit Expanded Universe, as well as some notes from high ranking producers. I gotta say, the envelope was pretty fat. I can’t be too detailed with my leak, nor can I include every planned project as I don’t want this information to be traced back to me. Here are the four most developed productions for the initiative. Just remember, all of the information that I put here is subject to change in the final television product, and if they pull a “Dark Universe” (2017-2017), I am not to blame.
** The Queen’s Gambit Declined: **
This second miniseries picks up where the "Queen’s Gambit" left off, with Beth Harmon having just won the Moscow Invitational.
Beth Harmon is riding high off her win against Borgov, and has been getting more and more stressed from all the additional expectations placed on her. This has led her into becoming a more reclusive and hateful character, reminiscent of Bobby Fischer. Her problematic tendencies have begun to compound, and she soon realizes that she is no longer playing that the level that she was supposed to be playing on. This rough realization sends her spiraling even further, and she once again locks herself in her family home. She invites Benny Watts to fix her game up, but he refuses over the phone, saying he has decided to become a cow rancher. Taking some liberties with the way the chess championship title is constructed, Beth Harmon receives an invitation to the Candidates tournament, the winner of which will be able to face the current world champion, the soviet genius Boris Popov. The script notes describe him as a mix between Tigran Petrossian and Boris Spassky, and as a jovial man that plays chess incredibly defensively and consistently. The central pressure of this season will be if Beth manages to get her addiction and mild racism (this obtained when her characterization was shifted more towards that of Fischer) under control for long enough to become a challenger for the upcoming world chess championship.
** The Bongcloud: **
A period piece stoner comedy, this Cheech and Chong-inspired film follows two college dropouts that smuggle marijuana using hollow chess boards and pieces. This plan goes awry when they come in contact with a Mexican drug lord and chess aficionado, who makes them play for their lives. Of course, neither of them even know how to play! This script is the least connected to the Queen’s Gambit out of any that I saw, and most likely was just a generic chess stoner comedy that got slightly modified to fit into Netflix’s plans. The only connections I could find were an on-off line about selling pills to orphanages, and Thomas Brodie-Sangster reprising his role as Benny Watts for a one scene cameo as a cow rancher.
** The Fried Liver Attack **
I have the least information on this one, as it is mainly a cooking show without a significant plot. Each episode will highlight a chess player, real or fictional, and then create their favorite dish. Each episode ends with that chess player eating the dish, and commenting on the quality. For example, episode 17 features the custodian William Shaibels favorite dish, a nice lobster Bisque. The chefs struggle with giving the soup the proper consistency, and William Shaibel dislikes the result. Episode 18 features Carlos Santana, a musician that has previously played chess. All episodes have been filmed, and plans have been made to release this show anyways if plans fall through for the other chess shows. The plan there will be to repurpose it as a reality tv show about cooking the favorite dishes of random Netflix users (played by struggling LA actors that technically are Netflix users), and keep the actual recipes the same. Plans for a second season are already underway, with negotiations for actual famous chess players underway.
**The Interactive 'Fortnite' Experience: **
Envisioned as a necessary aspect of the QGEU that adds significantly to the story, players will play the roles of advertising executives trying to get a hold of Beth Harmon so that they can get her to shill for their products. A chessboard will be located on the map, and the first player to find it becomes Beth Harmon. Unlike the ad execs, she doesn’t get to use a gun, and has to use her increased building speed and doubled rate of building materials to hide from these executives. When she feels she has the upper hand, the player controlling her is able to broadcast her location to all other players, wherein they will have five minutes to get her signature on some documents (shoot her with their guns) before they are all fired by their bosses (killed.) Along with this initiative will come a Beth Harmon skin, a Benny Watts skin, and a skin of Peely with a chess piece on his head. An assortment of new emotes and dances will also be added to the game, discounted for people who show proof of them having watched the entirety of “the Queen’s Gambit.” Among these will be one of normally playing chess, one of the character angrily resigning, one of the character wobbling while holding a comically large jar filled with pills, and a twerking one. This event is expected to be released one week before “Queen's Gambit Declined”, and will show what happened between episodes three and four of the show.
** Production Notes: **
The producers involved with the idea of a QGEU seem to have been very proud of themselves. They are all excited with the success of the "Queen’s Gambit" last year, and have been trying very hard to capitalize on it. Problematically, the projects in this line of stories have been having some troubled productions, and upper management at Netflix reduced their cash flow after the success of “Squid Game.” These producers (who I will give false initials due to my incapacity to name) have also been interfering in the productions, and trying to make their own marks. In their own words: 
K.L.: We need a Beth Harmon that is hip. She needs more swag. And she is lacking in what millennials call “girlboss." Our testing has found that millennial women in the 13-25 age range react well to these types of attributes. With this being the flagship show of the whole endeavor, we’ll also need to get the young male demographic. They love making memes.
R.P.: Like the darude sandstorm video we presented earlier.
K.L.: Yes, like darude sandstorm or nyan cat. We noticed a lot of people talking about the first “Queen’s Gambit” on Twitter, and we want to make more Twitter-able moments.
L.T.:  This is where I come in. I have been working with our stupid scriptwriters to get Anya to say something about her dad loving beans. This will connect us to the frankly hilarious bean dad series of tweets, which people will notice and tweet about.
W.F.: We should make her skateboard. Kids love skateboarding.
A.B.: My son loves "Fortnite," we should put "Fortnite" in.
K.L.: Fortnite sadly didn’t exist back then, but we have been in talks with Epic Games to have a “Queen's Gambit Declined” event. In the meanwhile we have added scenes of her playing video games in the episode where she locks herself in her house and has a mental breakdown. This will do well with young men.
A.B.: Will she hit a JUUL?
K.L.: Of course she will!
They then laugh furiously for 5 minutes while vigorously patting themselves on the back.

From the beginning of the building process over a week ago until the opening of Spring Carnival on Thursday, booths designed by organizations across campus brought a little extra life to Midway. In accordance with this year’s Carnival theme, “Ad Astra,” booths represented a wide range of ways to perceive space and the stars. Ranging from the literal — Phi Delta Theta’s “The Martian” or Kappa Sigma’s “Star Wars” — to the abstract, like Alpha Phi’s astrology-themed booth “Phinding Your Fortune” or Kappa Alpha Theta’s “Soul,” booths showed off the creative and technical skills of organization members from Greek life and other student organizations like Singapore Student Association and Astronomy Club.
Each booth displayed a myriad of design and construction work, including intricate murals and decorations as well as technical aspects like sound elements, lighted signs, and even computers set up for gaming and other attractions. Students spent hours preparing each booth both prior to “move on” and during the almost week-long stretch of actual construction in the College of Fine Arts parking lot. 
Booth Chair and architecture fifth-year Carly Sacco spoke with The Tartan about this year’s Booth competition. “The categories for competing are Blitz, which are 18 feet by nine feet, and then this year everyone else had to do a one-story which is 18 feet by 18 feet. They each get to design and build it pretty much however they want to. They're supposed to have a game and a prize as well,” she explained. The one-story booth is novel for Carnival, which normally hosts two-story booths, though safety considerations were changed this year to account for the lack of experience building when the last few Carnivals were canceled due to COVID-19. “Our biggest challenge was the level of inexperience,” said Sacco.
This year’s Carnival is the first held fully in person since 2019, meaning that most students at Carnegie Mellon have never experienced a Carnival. When it came to reviving Carnival traditions, students who attended Carnegie Mellon three years ago were left to guide their organizations based on what they remembered from their experiences during their first year. Though Booth standards remained the same, some organizations observed an adjustment period, which had warped with lack of use. When asked by The Tartan, members of Phi Kappa Theta noted that “it was a little bit challenging just having so few people who knew what Booth looked like. ... Just getting people on the same page in terms of expectations was a little bump in the road,” and that “getting the classes that hadn’t experienced Carnival excited for it was a little bit challenging.” 
Sacco added that, in addition to the inconsistent skill sets and presence of students new to Booth, some materials, like wood, that had been used in years past had warped with lack of use. “I feel like they were working with less-than-ideal materials,” she said, “A lot of the conditions were less than ideal to [build] in — it snowed during move-on. ... The wetness was really difficult.” 
To the detriment of many, move-on week also posed a significant challenge in the form of sporadic rain and low temperatures. Members of organizations like Alpha Phi noted that the weather made the build process slightly unpleasant, though students continued to work throughout long, cold nights to get their booths done on time. “They already felt like they were battling the odds,” said Sacco, noting the dedication put in by organizations to get their booths done despite the many challenges.
Because booths take such a significant effort, many organizations require their members to dedicate time to building and design. Members of Delta Gamma commented that “a lot of us didn't know how much time to allocate,” but that “it was really nice seeing people who hadn't done Booth in a long time come together for the sake of building something … it was a lot of hard work but it was nice … being with all of your friends and staying late, pulling those late hours and knowing that all together you have the work ethic to put something [like this] together.”
Their hard work paid off, with all booths ready to open on the first day of Carnival, something that’s “very rare” according to Sacco. Some changes from the pandemic era created new opportunities for organizations as well. The concept of the “Doghouse” or a miniature booth, was something that was introduced during COVID-19, but remained present this year. Sacco said, “I thought it was a nice way to keep something from the pandemic,” adding that it allowed more organizations to get involved with the tradition despite lacking the time or human resources of larger organizations. Despite the challenges of starting afresh after a break from Carnival, a member of Phi Kappa Theta said that they had “the opportunity to push into new territory and have murals on every single wall, which apparently was something that wasn't [normal] in the past.” 
Because booths have so many different components, from artistic to technical, students from all areas of academic life can contribute their unique skill sets to the build. A member of Delta Gamma commented, “I liked seeing what I'm learning in class come to fruition. I’m a civil engineering major, so this is exactly what we do. I know that a lot of upperclassmen used parts of their majors to make parts of the booth, like the sign outside, the girl that made it is in mechanical engineering. It was cool to see everyone grow into their majors. It's comforting to know that what you learn in class can be applied to real life.”
In the end, all of these carefully crafted components are judged by Booth alumni and Spring Carnival Committee members, as well as a panel that includes John Holmes, Director of the School of Architecture's ArchSHOP, Dylan Vitone of the School of Design, Vitone's daughter (who tested Booth games), Carnival advisor Andrew Greenwald, and Marelyn Maces and M. Shernell Smith of the Center for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Booths are judged and ranked with first, second, and third place awards within their respective structural and organizational categories — Fraternity, Sorority, Independent, Blitz, and Doghouse — as well as being evaluated by a separate panel for their environmental and safety considerations.
Though it was her first time on the executive board for SCC, Sacco reflected that she “felt welcomed with open arms and got to help the organizations create what they wanted to do, which was very rewarding.” Despite challenges, the tradition of Booth has been revived for many future generations of Tartans to enjoy.
The 2022 Booth results are as follows:
Fraternity:
    1st: Sigma Phi Epsilon (“Treasure Planet”)
    2nd: Phi Delta Theta (“The Martian”)
    3rd: Delta Tau Delta (“Mario Galaxy”)

The Undergraduate Student Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) met in a joint session on April 6 to ratify the results of the Student Body Elections. Though the meeting was slated to start at 5 p.m., the start was delayed because less than 51 percent of voting members were in attendance until about 5:15 p.m.
The meeting opened with some orders of business from GSA, and then the election results were presented. Petitions for those interested in running opened Feb. 18 at noon and closed March 4 at noon. The rules meeting was held at 5 p.m. on March 16 and candidate platforms were due on March 26. Elections were open from March 30 at 2:30 p.m. to April 4 at 2:30 p.m. The Elections Board (EB) certified the elections on April 4, which led to the ratification on April 6. 
During the presentation, it was noted there were a few issues with voting this year. Some students had reported they were not able to access or sign petitions using a mobile device. This issue was reportedly fixed Feb. 24. Additionally, the voting period had to be extended by two hours due to the DNS registry for the elections being taken off Carnegie Mellon’s network on March 30, which had caused a two hour delay to the elections opening. 
The last issue was that no candidate had signed up to run for Student Body Vice President for Organizations (SBVPO) shortly before the petition deadline, so EB voted unanimously to suspend the requirements for this election. The requirements stated that a student who runs for SBVPO must have served at least one term as a student leader, served at least one term on the Committee on Student Organizations, or have served at least one term on the University Center Allocations Board. 
There was a 12 percent turnout of students for the election, the highest since 2017. Seventeen percent of undergraduate students and six percent of graduate students voted in the election. Candidates needed at least one percent of votes from graduate students and undergraduates, respectively, to be eligible for the position. This is applied in each round and a candidate who has not reached that minimum would be eliminated over one who had. 
If any candidate were to receive a penalty in their campaign, the penalty would be applied as a scaling factor every round that a candidate received them. There were four reports of campaign violations. The first was a report against an Instagram post made by the Salazar-Song campaign which claimed that the Chan-Abrams campaign did not discuss campus sexual assault and feminist issues during the Student Body President (SBP) debates. EB determined this post did not constitute slander or libel of another candidate or campaign team, so no penalty was awarded.
The next report was against the Chan-Abrams campaign, which cited that one of their Instagram posts could be slanderous to other candidates. EB determined this was not the case and no penalty was awarded. 
The third report was an allegation of voter bribery against SBVPO candidate Daphne Han. Han held a giveaway of a long cat plushie that EB determined was worth $14, which is under the limit of the $25 maximum for gifts to voters. As such, no penalty was awarded. Another report was filed in regards to the same giveaway, which alleged improper communication of the Han campaign. The report stated the collection of Andrew IDs as part of the giveaway may be misused later. As voters are allowed to give their contact information to candidates and individual contact is permissible under elections rules, the EB did not award a penalty. 
Voting was conducted via single transferable vote. This means if someone chooses a candidate who doesn't win the election after the first round of counting and no other candidate meets the requirements to win, the candidate with the least amount of votes will have them distributed to the other candidates who were the voters' second choice. If a candidate, however, fails to meet a requirement like not getting one percent of the graduate vote, they are eliminated from contention prior to someone who has less votes but meets the voting requirement. This will continue for several "rounds" of counting until a victor is declared. 
For the Student Body President (SBP) and Student Body Vice President (SBVP) elections, candidates Natalie Salazar and Joan Song were elected as SBP and SBVP, respectively. A total of 1,190 ballots were cast in the election, with candidates needing at least 596 total votes and 72 grad student votes. After 11 rounds of counting, they were declared the winners. Vote totals did not change until round seven when write-in candidates were eliminated. Notably, the Chan-Abrams campaign was eliminated in round 10 of counting before no confidence votes, as they did not secure the 72 grad student votes needed. There was a difference of five votes between Salazar-Song and Chan-Abrams prior to Chan-Abrams' elimination.
For Student Body Vice President for Finance (SBVPF), candidate Clarissa Liang was immediately declared the victor due to being ranked first in more than 50 percent of all ballots cast, and her reaching the minimum vote percentage. Five hundred seventy two ballots were cast; Liang needed 287 total votes and 72 grad student votes to win. She received 104 grad student votes and 526 total votes.
In the SBVPO contest, candidate Lucia Fang was declared the winner after five rounds of counting. Out of 1,043 ballots cast, a candidate needed at least 522 total votes and 72 grad student votes to be declared the winner. Initially, Fang had 386 votes, Han had 347 votes, and Urvish Thakker had 293 votes. The rest were no confidence or write-in candidates. Though Han had more total votes than Thakker, she was eliminated in round three due to not having enough grad student votes. No confidence votes were eliminated next, followed by Thakker, leaving Fang as the winner of the race.
Six candidates ran for seven seats for School of Computer Science Senators. Winners include Medha Palavalli, Han, James Gallicchio, Claire Jin, William Gay, and Brad Zhang. 10 candidates ran for 12 Senate seats in the College of Engineering. Doreen Valmyr, Bojun Sun, Anthony Lindemann, Rose McDermott, Prithu Pareek, Ryan Lin, Lawrence Onyango, Jeanie Xu, Aneesha Bhattacharjee, and Mason Xiao will be holding these positions. Four candidates ran for six seats in the College of Fine Arts. Ethan Johnson, Lake Lewis, Matthew Rygelski, and Andrea Wan were elected to the positions. Seven candidates ran for 10 seats for Dietrich College Senators. Those elected included Jacky Gao, Matthew Visco, Saloni Gandhi, Kyle Hynes, Silas Wang, Fang, and Diana Crookston. Four candidates ran for six seats within the Mellon College of Science; Pearl Franz, Aramchan Lee, Victoria Liu, and Neha Murthy will be taking these seats. Within the Tepper School of Business, five candidates ran for five seats. As no confidence received more votes than one of the candidates, Alexandria Donohue, Briana Chen, Elizabeth Fu, and Timmy Cheung were elected. For the BXA & SHS seat, there were three candidates and Himalini Guruaj was elected to the seat.
Following the presentation of the votes, the floor was opened to questions and discussion which would be followed by a ratification of the election by the Senate and GSA. An undergraduate senator made a motion to ratify the election of SBVPO separately, stating that he felt the candidate who won was unqualified for the position since she didn’t meet the requirements to run for the position. However, as EB had lifted the requirements for a candidate to run for SBVPO this semester, Fang was able to run even if she didn’t meet any of the requirements that the position would typically have. After some discussion between the Senate and GSA, the Senate voted 8-9-1 to split off the ratification of the SBVPO election. Since the motion did not pass the Senate, GSA did not vote on the motion. The Senate and GSA then moved to ratify the election. The Senate voted 16-1-1 to ratify the election and GSA voted 59-1-0 to ratify.

This week, Carnegie Mellon announced that former Pittsburgh mayor Bill Peduto would join Heinz College as a Distinguished Executive in Residence. In this role, Peduto will co-teach a mini-course and give guest lectures, according to a press release from Heinz College.
In an interview with The Tartan, Peduto stressed that his position at Carnegie Mellon will be a continuation of his work as mayor. Peduto said that during his time as mayor, many companies he recruited to Pittsburgh were drawn in by "the work that was coming out of Carnegie Mellon."
Now, Peduto hopes to continue building Pittsburgh industries from the other side. "I see that type of ability in being a part of the Carnegie Mellon family … to be able to continue to build much in the same way that we were able to do through our administration," Peduto said.
In the Heinz College press release, Peduto noted working at Carnegie Mellon was a way to "formalize our relationship" after collaborating with the university throughout his time on City Council and then as mayor. In the interview, he said his position at Carnegie Mellon came about during a conversation with University President Farnam Jahanian.
Peduto said that during that conversation, "I expressed that sometime later in my career I truly wanted to teach." Peduto continued, "He made the offer of coming on board on a part-time basis and being able to work with people who I've had that opportunity to work with over the past 30 years." 
Director of Media Relations Peter Kerwin, speaking on behalf of Jahanian, confirmed Peduto's account. He said, "following President Jahanian's exchange with Mr. Peduto, Heinz College welcomed the opportunity to work with the former Mayor."
Carnegie Mellon's work has become more urgent because many industries like construction are evolving, Peduto said. "All of the different types of ideas that we've thought about or maybe not thought about will be completely different within the next few decades," Peduto explained. Carnegie Mellon will be crucial to Pittsburgh's evolution, he said, because Pittsburgh "also needs the capacity of a partner that has the ability to innovate."
Some of the Carnegie Mellon community praised Peduto's hiring. In the Heinz College press release, Dean of Heinz College Ramayya Krishnan said, "While in office, Mayor Peduto modernized city government and truly transformed Pittsburgh into a leading 21st century city. We know our students will benefit from his leadership experience as well as his expertise in public policy and management." 
Richard D. Caluguiri University Professor of History Joel Tarr, who studies the environmental history of cities and has featured Peduto as a speaker in his classes, complimented Peduto's service as mayor. Tarr wrote in an emailed statement, "I thought that he was a fine mayor, innovative and far-seeing. Over the years, he visited my CMU Pittsburgh class several times, both as a Councilman and later as mayor, and always related well to the students. His appointment will be of benefit to the college and its students." (Disclosure: I was in Tarr's class last semester, where Peduto spoke.)
As his mayoral loss last year showed, though, Peduto has sometimes been disconnected from Pittsburgh voters. Catherine Taipe, who was later elected Student Body Vice President, panned Peduto's efforts to get Pittsburgh nonprofits to pay payments in lieu of taxes in 2021, calling them "the bare minimum." Taipe could not be reached for comment.
In an emailed statement, Graduate Student Assembly President Divyansh Kaushik cited the Mon-Oakland Connector as one of Peduto's policies Carnegie Mellon students did not support. Still, Kaushik praised his work on national issues. "He was (and is) a strong voice for international students during the Trump administration's constant assault on the very presence of these students," Kaushik said. He added, "I hope the Mayor is able to draw upon his experiences as a champion for students as he was in situations where he was an ally but also takes this as an opportunity to also learn from the students as to why the students were unsupportive of certain policies of his administration."
Along with his new position at Carnegie Mellon, Peduto announced that he was starting a new consulting firm, Sabean Innovation Inc., for businesses and nonprofits. Its mission is to advocate for the "development ideology that the Peduto administration created," according to the press release. Peduto also announced that he will be a keynote speaker at the Global Covenant of Mayors summit on climate action next week.
Nonetheless, Peduto sees his role at Carnegie Mellon as the one with the biggest potential. 
"Creating the S-Corporation has been a pleasure, and it's given me an opportunity to work on and with companies and nonprofits that I've enjoyed working with in the fields throughout my career," Peduto said. He added, "But this opportunity is something completely new. And it is the one that excites me the most."

“However we dress, wherever we go,” shouted Carlow University sophomore Caitlin Hoag last weekend. “Consent isn’t optional; no means no,” a group of 100 responded as they marched down Forbes Ave on April 3. It was the launch to a series of events hosted by Pittsburgh universities for Sexual Assault Awareness Month. The walk, Pittsburgh Universities Believe Survivors (PUBS), was a collaboration between Project SAFE at Carlow University and the Title IX offices at Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh. 
Participants gathered in University Commons at Carlow University to pick up T-shirts and magnetic pronoun pins. Many students gathered to create posters while pop music by female artists played overhead. Art supplies were strewn across tables as students spelled out messages like, “‘No’ does not mean ‘convince me,’” “Love should not be deadly,” and “Clothes aren’t consent.”
Organizers hope that this year’s PUBS walk will become an annual event. “I talk about consent all the time,” said Hoag, who spearheaded plans for the walk. “It’s not annoying, though, because we need to talk about it. That’s how you find out when you’re a sophomore in college, ‘Hey, that thing that happened in high school was not normal and … nobody should feel that way.”
The walk was intended to create a space where survivors could feel safe, supported, and heard. Many speakers expressed the isolation they felt during and after abusive experiences. One Carlow affiliate, who is a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, domestic violence, and workplace harassment, told the crowd: “When you’re a survivor, it can definitely feel very lonely, feel like people don’t support you or don’t understand. I just want to let you all know that there are people out there who do support you and do understand. And the story is definitely way too common. When I went into social work … I can’t count how many people came out and told me their stories about just different things they have experienced.”
Hoag had a similar experience when she became a peer mentor at Project SAFE, an initiative to combat sexual and domestic violence. The program’s launch coincided with the advent of COVID-19, so it has only recently gained traction at Carlow. Once Hoag told her friends about her role at Project SAFE, she was shocked by how many friends had stories of harassment and assault. Yet she also felt grounded by the fact that Project SAFE had created a space for students to share. It was one of the many ways the initiative, introduced by Carlow’s Director of Gender-Based Violence Prevention Erin Tunney, has shifted conversations about consent on campus. 
Prior to the pandemic, Carnegie Mellon also had a Project SAFE team. But when school went virtual for a year and a half, all the structural information graduated with its student leaders. “My freshman year it was really strong,” said Carnegie Mellon senior Mashia Mazumder, who is the president of CMU FEMME. “They had Take Back the Night, art galleries in April, and then post-COVID it died.” When Madzummer reached out with a request to collaborate on similar events last spring, she never received a response. 
Project SAFE does not exist at the University of Pittsburgh, but the school is home to a student-led group that is making similar efforts. Underdog, a start-up idea that launched last year, is being led by first-year Katie Gallo, junior Esme Stasa, and sophomore Wythe Chen. They are creating a platform with online modules to teach women the warning signs of sexual and domestic violence. Gallo said it is designed to be engaging and tailored to women, who are nine times more likely to experience rape than men. In February, Underdog received first place in Big Idea Blitz, a start-up competition for Carnegie Mellon and Pitt students and the Randall Family Competition, hosted by the Pitt Innovation Institute. Underdog is partnering with women’s centers “to meet that gap between young adulthood … and then not having to need those services when you are in your 30s or 40s … Ideally we are trying to teach college women what a healthy relationship looks like,” Stasa explained in an interview. 
Stasa, who is studying finance and accounting, made an impromptu speech at the end of the PUBS walk. She said that as a child, she thought the domestic violence she experienced was normal. Then one day during her first year in high school, her guidance counselor asked if Stasa’s sartorial choices were a reflection of her family’s financial struggles. “I remember thinking: I wish I was poor. I wish that was my problem.” Instead, Stasa showed her counselor the bruises her clothing had covered. 
After telling her counselor, she never returned to her childhood house. She was taken to a women’s shelter with her younger sisters, who were in seventh and second grade. “I can wholeheartedly say that I would not be here today had it not been for the guidance counselor that reached out,” Stasa said, emphasizing the importance of being seen and supported. “You do repeat the cycle. I married at 21 and became financially abused … I was a homemaker for 10 years, and I’m taking my life back,” she said emphatically, encouraged by a whoop and a ripple of cheers from the audience. At the end of her speech, Stasa promoted Underdog’s work to help college women break the cycle. 
The student-led initiative is an alternative to university supports, which are not always known by or accessible to students. Mazumder feels that, while the Title IX office at Carnegie Mellon is doing good work, it is unknown by most students. Part of this is because “it’s not physically on campus, so it feels kind of detached,” she explained in an interview. “You only see it if you’re seeking it out, but [Title IX resources] should be something people know about ahead of time.”
Title IX offices are a relatively new feature of U.S. higher education. The one at Carnegie Mellon began in 2015, led by alum and Associate Director for Education and Outreach Jamie Edwards-Pasek. In an interview at PUBS, she acknowledged the limitations of the office. Of the more than 200 reports received in a typical year, only five to 10 cases go to a hearing. One reason for this low outcome is that some reports are beyond the university’s jurisdiction, like cases that occur off-campus and do not involve a Carnegie Mellon student. But she also suspected that “people are afraid of being re-traumatized through the process. I think they kind of do a cost-benefit analysis … it’s a lot of costs; you’re sharing your personal life, you may be missing class or other types of extracurriculars to be meeting with my office or … [others] for the hearing; it’s very stressful, it’s very emotional.”
Though many students do not want the university to formally respond to the report — in fact, “the vast majority of people who have ever been reported don’t even know that they have been reported,” Edwards-Pasek explained — the Title IX office does have a helpful strategy in its back pocket: informal resolution. The office issues no-contact agreements and invites reported students to the office for prevention education. A Title IX representative will sit down with the student, discuss their behaviors, and send them off with learning resources. Edwards-Pasek’s favorites are In The Know, a RadioLab podcast, and a “really interesting legal-philosophical meditation on what consent is” by Oxford Press.

This is the first year many student organizations have returned to in-person events. Consequently, many organizations at Carnegie Mellon are facing the challenge of transitioning their leadership and knowledge to new members. The Spring Carnival Committee (SCC) is no exception — the team is tasked with reviving a vaunted and well-loved Carnegie Mellon tradition. SCC is responsible for most aspects of Carnival, ranging from Booth to the vendors and activities that line Midway and the Cut. Whether a loss of two years' worth of experience would hinder the event's rebirth remained an open question.
The first step for the SCC to plan Carnival was deciding the theme. The selection process began May 2021, where the SCC courted theme submissions from the Carnegie Mellon community. These suggestions were accepted until the start of the Fall 2021 semester. In August, the executive board of SCC listed their top 10 submissions. From there, Booth chairs voted to narrow down the finalists. It is then up to the SCC advisor and chair to select the final theme.
“I think for a long time we had wanted to see a space- and celestial-themed Carnival and that was probably the most common theme suggested across all of the submissions from that giant form that we had open,” SCC chair Asad Sheikh recounted in an interview with The Tartan. “We also really liked how it ties into a lot of the previous themes. Past themes have been Myths and Legends and Planet Earth, and Ad Astra ties into all those themes — in a literal and metaphorical sense.”
With theme selection completed and Carnival fast approaching, the physical work was about to begin. But many SCC members, like Head of Operations Tianxin Xu, had no previous Carnival preparation experience to draw upon. “A lot of the plans I got for operations were very high level items like 'Call and make contracts' and I was like ‘What does that entail?’” Xu said. “It involves a lot of little things like getting quotes and submitting stuff to SLICE finance, and organizing when things are going to be due. But our advisor, Andrew, has been around for many years, so he was helpful in filling in a lot of the gaps.” Xu was not on SCC the last time Carnival was held, so she has had to rely on the experience of others in the organization and on documents that had been passed down to her. 
Coordinator of SLICE Andrew Greenwald currently serves as advisor to the SCC and has helped to fill in the knowledge gaps that were left by the pandemic. Both Xu and Sheikh noted their appreciation for Greenwald and how much help he had been in putting Carnival together this year. 
Sheikh also stated that a difference from this year compared to previous years is the number of members on the executive board of SCC that simply haven’t experienced Carnival before. “We had to spend more time talking about what Carnival is, which isn’t necessarily done on the executive board,” he said.
As this is Xu's first time as a member of SCC when an in-person Carnival was occurring, she notes some difficulties she'd encountered leading up to Carnival: “I had to sort out the deliveries of things like the fences [around Midway], shipping containers — and I didn’t have much experience — and I was like ‘I don’t know what any of this is,’” Xu said. “The most fun part, though, has been being [part of move-on] this week. It’s been really fun to just be around committee and [executive board] and get to spend more time with them.”
When asked what the biggest misconception about Carnival is, Sheikh said that many students don’t realize just how much of Carnival is student-run. Contrary to the belief of some students that the administration has a heavy hand in Carnival, most aspects of Carnival are controlled and managed entirely by SCC.
With the hotly-anticipated, historic revival of Carnival this year, it was essential for SCC to make sure they were able to effectively execute their job as overseers of Carnival to ensure a positive experience for students and the broader community. “Though Carnival is never really formally introduced to people, we want people to experience all the great things that Carnival has to offer,” Shiekh said. "It’s great to have an event for the whole campus and it’s a time for all the students to have a sense of community.”

Disclaimer: this article includes spoilers for seasons 1 and 2 of “Bridgerton.” Please proceed with caution. You have been warned.
Dear gentle reader, 
If you have glanced at Netflix for even a moment in the past few weeks, you will have noticed the enrapturing release of the second season of “Bridgerton.” A quarantine favorite, “Bridgerton” is a sexy take on Regency-era England — like “Gossip Girl” but in corsets and waistcoats. However, the best part of “Bridgerton” is undoubtedly its refreshing take on the motto “gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss.” From long-running staple GILF and hot-bitch-in-charge Lady Danbury to new additions Miss Kate and Edwina Sharma, the streets of Mayfair are bustling with women who get what they want, when they want, no matter what any man has to say about it — but why this sudden obsession with kickass women?
The 21st century has been the era of the "girlboss.” It is hard to avoid magazine covers displaying these confident boss-ass bitches in pantsuits, arms folded, talking about their up-and-coming Fortune 500 companies. So, it is no surprise that television has had to jump on this fast-moving train. 
But first, what is a “girlboss”? 
The proper scientific classification is gaslightae gatekeepinae girlbossus, a class of woman who take shit from no one. They make their own decisions, their own money, and their own empires. Did she make a mistake? No. You’re clearly mistaken, because the girlboss is perfect. Can you have what she has? No. She works for what’s hers and doesn’t need to give it to anyone. She is an icon. The girlboss is a queen. Thus, we introduce our first "Bridgerton" Girlboss™ — the Queen of England, Queen Charlotte.
This queen is not only royalty, but a gossip and gatekeeping savant. At the start of season 2, she decides that she needs to take the gossiping narrative of the town back into her well-manicured hands. To do so, she names Miss Edwina Sharma the season’s diamond, a.k.a. the hottest debutante on the market. Miss Edwina is a perfect lady, and with the guidance of her sister, she intends to marry a member of the Ton — but only a man worthy of her grace and love. Little does she know, the Queen’s decision was calculated; instantly we see the Viscount, Anthony Bridgerton, the cream of the crop man-with-a-plan (not to mention easy on the eyes), begin to court her. However, there’s one problem: girlboss #2, Miss Kate Sharma, the sister of Edwina.
Kate is introduced to us on horseback, riding through a misty morning without a chaperone (gasp). However, she is not alone. Anthony Bridgerton notices her from afar and is immediately entranced. He urges her to return to town with him, but, never one to take men at their first word, she instead runs off and rejects his flirtatious advances. Gaslight. Then, after being named the season’s diamond, Anthony begins to chase her sister, but Kate disapproves, having overheard some of his unsavory opinions on love and marriage. Gatekeep. However, being the hottie with a body she is, Anthony cannot move past the festering desire he feels for Kate. Unfortunately for Edwina, the feelings are mutual. Still, Kate observes girl code first and refuses to even acknowledge Anthony as a viable suitor for her or her sister. Gatekeep. It is only at the end of the season that she ultimately takes him as her husband, but it’s on her terms, not his. Girlboss.
As all of this is unfolding, someone is lurking in the background, pulling the strings of high society. That someone is none other than Lady Whistledown — girlboss #3. Penelope Featherington is a young lady on the grind, not only thirsting after Colin Bridgerton but also keeping the Ton wrapped around her pinky. Throughout the season, she convinces all of society that she is just another girl (gaslight), she supports a fellow woman’s business, and best of all, she uses men to do the dirty work for her. They carry, print, and deliver her work, and she gets paid all the while. Every other girlboss lives in her shadow, waiting for her to give the final word on each and every match and debutante of the season. She is the voice of the Ton. She is the moment. She is Bridgerton.
But wait. Somehow, the show feels incomplete. Who’s going to provide guidance to all these young debutantes? Who’s going to carry all this gossip throughout society? The mamas, that’s who. Enter girlbosses #4 and 5 — Lady Bridgerton and Lady Danbury.
Talk about hotties. MILFS. GILFS. They stand above the rakes and diamonds of Mayfair. They are women who got theirs, and now have the freedom, the wisdom, and the bravado to help those who so desperately need their guidance. From setting up their children with the most eligible bachelors and bachelorettes of the Ton, to making sure those same children don’t screw up their lives through narrow-minded self-sabotage (in the case of Kate and Anthony), they just make better decisions than you ever could. They got more in their prime than you ever will. Forget prime — they don’t know the meaning of the word. These are eternal girlbosses, forever on top of whatever game they choose to play.
If you still have not had a chance to watch these girlbosses in action, get off your lazy butt and go to Netflix. Go to search, and (without any shame) play episode one of "Bridgerton." You won’t bee sorry (if you know, you know).

For many of us, growing up with our favorite video games was integral to childhood. For some, that favorite game was obscure at the time and has been lost. But is time really to blame for the fact that these games are now unplayable? Most video game communities have made some kind of a preservation effort, but why don't more companies play an active role in the preservation efforts of their own games?
Many recent consoles have some form of backward compatibility, or virtual console feature. For instance, Sony’s PlayStation 5 has backward compatibility for nearly all PlayStation 4 software, meaning a player can play nearly all the games they had previously purchased for the last generation of consoles.
However, when a game storage medium switches between console generations, this is no longer possible. For instance, the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Wii U. The Switch uses cartridges while the Wii U used a disc format — clearly you would not be able to use a Wii U disc on a Switch. This is where a virtual console system would be useful. If the Switch had a built-in emulator that could play Wii U games, that would have a Wii U virtual console. This is useful for when a system — like the Wii U — didn’t sell well and people who didn’t have one still want to play the games that were on the system.
With every new generation of consoles comes the potential to lose more gaming history if backward compatibility is no longer an option or if the company chooses not to develop or release virtual consoles on their new system. There is also a matter of whether or not the old games would still be playable in the new format. While Sony and Microsoft have kept their systems similar each generation, Nintendo has had drastic changes from their original system. Some major changes would need to be made to port a Wii game to the Switch (though I still think they did a good job adapting the controls of “Super Mario Galaxy.”)
Though consoles may have backward compatibility or a virtual console, there’s no saying that it will carry on between generations. Notably, the PlayStation 4 didn’t have the compatibility of its previous two generations and the PSP, PlayStation 3, and PS Vita stores were slated to close in 2021. This was postponed, but it is more difficult to purchase games on these systems. If these stores were to close, it would be much more difficult to access older video games that simply haven’t found their way to the newest generation of consoles and probably never will. They’ll be lost to time like so many games before them.
This is where community efforts come into play. For some games, emulation is the most accessible way to still play them. As such, there are communities dedicated to creating emulators or getting Read Only Memories (ROMs) of games so that their legacy will live on. “Dolphin Emulator” is a great example of community efforts to preserve games — it can run both Gamecube and Wii games and, of those, at least 96.9 percent of their library titles are playable. 
But what about the legality of emulation? Downloading an emulator is completely legal; it’s like downloading any other piece of software from the internet. The problem comes with ROMs. As ROMs are the properties of their maker, uploading and downloading them is illegal. It is only legal if you obtain a ROM from a copy of the game that you already own. While I don’t condone emulation, it is unfortunately one of the only ways to play many games. Some people with rarer games will “dump” games on the internet, a good way to distribute games that were never officially released. One example is an early version of “Pokémon Gold and Silver” that was shown off at Spaceworld in 1997 was uploaded online (an illegal action) in 2018 for the community to experience.
While uploading ROMs to the internet may be illegal, it’s one of the only ways to experience games like this. Nintendo is known for taking down websites that distribute ROMs. In 2021, the owner of a Nintendo ROM distribution site was sued by Nintendo, who won the case with a ruling of $2.1 million. While Nintendo may never see a cent of that money, it sent a clear message to others who run ROM distribution sites: watch out.
But without these sites, how would new fans of games get to experience the earlier entries in their beloved franchise without turning to pirating? The answer is simply that companies need to take more responsibility in preserving gaming history. While it may cost time and resources for a company to do so (which is probably the main factor why many don’t), it’s also a part of their legacy. The recent release of cult-classic “EarthBound” and other games on the Switch’s Nintendo 64 virtual console is proof that there is demand for these older games to be made easily playable once again.
Localization, however, is a whole different beast. This arguably requires more time and resources since you can’t just take a pre-existing ROM and run it on an emulator; a team actually has to take time to translate the text and then implement it into the game. While it would be great for the audiences which are foreign to the original game company to experience a company’s entire game library, it is likely that fans will have to continue to rely on the efforts of a few to actually experience games. “Mother 3” is an excellent example of this. The next game in the series that includes “EarthBound,” it was only published in Japanese and never received a Western release. Fans have been asking for a localization for decades and former Nintendo America President and COO Reggie Fils-Aime has even tweeted jokes about it.
While there certainly is a market for older video games, it’s likely going to continue to be up to fans to make sure more obscure games don’t fall into the depths of gaming history and can continue to be played in the future. Gaming companies (especially Nintendo) should be more aware of their audience and more supportive of preserving the history of gaming.

"I wish I went on the rides... I wish we didn't have to pay for the rides." - Amanda, Class of '25
"I just didn't go to the Carnival events so... I went to a few things like the concert. Um... I watched 'RENT.' Other than that, I didn't do much." - Vivian, Class of '25
"This is my first Carnival, so I really enjoyed it. I got to see a lot of school spirit at Buggy — which hasn't happened before. I really loved seeing the talent show and seeing how talented the students here are. There was like a wide variety. There was drag, there was comedy, there was singing, there was music, so I really enjoyed that." - Victoria, Class of '24 
"I don't think you want us to answer that question. We were at softball all weekend, so we were not here...So, we didn't even get to go." - Olivia, Class of '25
"Our regret is that we didn't have time." - Abbey, Class of '25

I am not going to take this very seriously because no one should take awards shows seriously.
Will Smith’s slap heard around the world has gotten everyone talking about the Oscars once again, and viewership went up 58 percent from last year’s record low viewership. Still, it’s a bare bones viewership compared to what it used to be. So why is no one watching the Oscars anymore?
Because award shows don’t matter. I can’t believe this is an article I’ve written multiple times.
This should be obvious, but awards shows are not an accurate representation of the best films of the year nor are they a list of films that are curated by people who actually know what they’re talking about. Awards shows are all a game designed by industry professionals to network and advertise their products rather than celebrate artistry and cinema.
The Oscars currently have four major issues.
1) Low viewership 
2) The whole thing is a waste of everyone’s time
3) “For your consideration” campaigns
4) The members are pretty stupid
The Academy has tried so many methods to boost viewership over the last few years. Mainstream films have been getting more serious award recognition, such as the Best Picture nominations for both “Black Panther” and “Joker.” But, let’s be honest. Neither of those movies were that good and the entire point of nominating them was to get people to tune in. The Academy has been trying to be more cognizant of diversity in their nominations, so at least that is something. But it’s too little too late, and honestly, it looks more like tokenism rather than actually picking really good nominees.
To condense the Oscars, the Academy tried to make the show shorter by getting rid of on-air telecasts of some awards like cinematography and editing (the things that make the movie a movie), but they didn’t think of putting a 30-second cap for the award show speeches or putting less ads in their breaks. Why do we allow these millionaires to talk for so long? We get it. You won an award. Now go act in your next project. Who cares? It gets even worse when it’s someone who feels the need to show the world how self-important and indulgent they are. There are always the people who like to talk about politics without knowing anything, and their statements are made more ironic when they show up in mediocre advertisements rotting the brains of Americans. Will Smith’s speech was six minutes and he spent all of it talking about being a vessel of love when clearly he is a vessel for crocodile tears. Ultimately, the show wasn’t any shorter either. If anything, it felt longer because for some reason Amy Schumer was allowed to show her face on camera. Coincidentally, every time she was on screen, the 16.6 million Oscar viewers turned to stone for five minutes.
It doesn’t help that reasons three and four are interconnected. The entire show is pay-to-win and has been for a long time. Studios spend millions of dollars for these movies to win Oscars because Academy members are not all individuals who are specialized in their specific roles in the industry. A lot of them don’t even watch the movies, and it clearly shows when every year, Disney wins Oscars for average animated movies like “Encanto.” Plus, the academy isn’t very diverse, and it shows with a lot of the film choices. There is so obviously a “type” of movie that tends to win an award show, and there are some years where it is so clear just how “political” the choices are. This year, the Academy had the audacity to try to have a message about the war in Ukraine, but I guarantee you there will be a war action drama called “Ghosts of Kyiv” starring Jeremy Renner as Volodymyr Zelenskyy just because five white liberal women on Twitter wanted it.
This is fairly underrated, but a lot of people also don’t know just how bad the decisions for some categories like editing are. One time the Academy gave “Bohemian Rhapsody” the Oscar for best editing even though the movie was edited by someone with short-term memory loss. A lot of the time, the editing goes to the flashiest, most aggressively noticeable editing rather than actual good editing that makes the story tighter and helps the movie flow nicely. Sound usually goes to the loudest movie. Best song is usually the worst song. I don’t even want to get started on some of the decisions made for makeup and hairstyling. All of this happens, and every few minutes the Academy will make these clips of famous movies to remind people of all the good movies they like that didn’t win awards. This year, there was a clip show compilation of the most hype audience moments and the number one choice was the one shot in “Spider-Man: No Way Home” of all the three Spider-Men, just to really remind everyone that the things they like are not actually real and are manufactured by a committee of faceless executives with generic brand names.
Anyway, award shows don’t matter. This same set of complaints applies to all of them. The Grammys are even more industry focused, and that is just something record executives use to find an excuse to do cocaine with Jay-Z and Beyonce. The Golden Globes are fake. The Emmys nominate the same five shows every year. The Tonys don’t care about theater and are just snobs who want to keep Broadway insulated. None of this matters. Just watch whatever you want and then go outside and touch grass. It’s better than sitting through any of these shows.

Carnegie Mellon students know a lot. We know complicated programming languages, lines-long physics equations, and convoluted chemistry procedures. We know how to grind and cram and study like there’s no tomorrow. But there is an important lesson that many students have yet to learn: how to take a break. 
Carnival weekend is the one time that students allow themselves to loosen up and have a good time. It is a three-day respite from the arduous grind of school work. Students make up for 28 weeks of studying with three days of fun. This is not the healthy balance students need. College is just as much about spending time with friends as it is about cranking out the latest problem set. The late nights spent talking are much more memorable than the ones spent pounding code into a keyboard. Carnival reminds us of this reality, but is it the only time students can fully embrace having fun?
There are a lot of reasons why Carnegie Mellon students can’t calm down. Many are reflective of inner conflicts experienced by members of The Tartan Editorial Staff, too. We understand the pressure to constantly be in motion, engaged in as many extracurriculars and leadership opportunities as possible because the moment we pause to take a breath, we’ll feel like we have too much time on our hands. We have become conditioned to associate relaxation with failure, and it is changing the way we interpret our workload. We see hyper-condensed schedules as right, and moments of reprieve wrong. But, to quote Glennon Doyle from her memoir Untamed, “Right is not real and should is a cage.” We need to embrace Now. 
Students need to unlearn their impulse to overwork themselves and spend more time living in the moment. College is a uniquely valuable time in students’ lives. Away from home, students are encouraged to explore not just the world around them but also themselves. While academic obligations are one facet of identity, they are not the central pillar that Carnegie Mellon’s culture quite often makes it out to be. We need to pull our hearts out of the work sometimes, so that we can check our personal barometers for new interests. 
Imposter syndrome is experienced across the country on college campuses, but feels especially acute at Carnegie Mellon. To cope, many students plunge into as many activities as is physically possible to engage with — and then some. But students could use the reminder that they’re not the only ones feeling this way. Campus culture encourages people to conflate doing enough with being enough. Who are you to insert yourself into conversation when you’ve never been a computer science teaching assistant? Who are you to share an opinion when you are barely scraping by in your MechE lab? The Tartan Editorial Staff want you to know that regardless of the number of hours you spend on schoolwork, you are enough. 
Being in touch with yourself is just as important as tomorrow’s quiz and next week’s lab report. The combined pressures of peer competition and academic expectation make it seem hard to reconcile school with social spaces. There is also the pervasive worry that taking a few hours for ourselves means we have to be alone with our thoughts, a situation many would rather avoid. But it is important for students to be in touch with their needs, not just their academic demands. 
Understanding and advocating for yourself are integral to a healthy college lifestyle. Carnival weekend offers students the opportunity to know what it feels like to take a break. And it feels good! Rather than pushing that feeling away, incorporate it into your schedule. Make happiness part of the routine. When exams are prioritized over friendships, joy is kicked down to the basement. But happiness should be as much of a staple in your day as the fridge in the kitchen. Normalize saying no to the things that bring you down and yes to the things that build you up. When Carnival is just one of the many weekends of joy on Carnegie Mellon’s campus, students will have finally achieved success. And with our constant grind, isn’t success what we’re after?
