Well, the time is finally here for everyone to start thinking about their brackets. I know what you’re thinking: Where do I begin? How do I choose my teams? What even is March Madness? Well, worry not, because I am here to help you. If you’re just as clueless as me but decided to try and get involved anyway, we’ll figure this out together.
What is March Madness?
March Madness is the one time of the year that everyone, except for the few people that actually are interested, pretends like they are passionate about college basketball. It’s the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college men’s basketball tournament. Despite having March in the name, the event culminates with the final championship game at the beginning of April. Much like Easter, the date of this game can fluctuate between the end of March and the beginning of April. However, the madness truly does happen in March.
Games are played elimination style and begin with 68 teams. Teams are slowly knocked out until only 16 teams remain. This group, titled the Sweet Sixteen, is often where the casual watcher begins to actually start to pay attention. This continues to the Elite Eight, Final Four, and finally, the championship game resulting in a winner.
Calendar of Events
March 11: Selection Sunday
This is the day that the 68 teams that will compete are chosen. This is also the day where the men’s brackets and seeds, or rankings, are released to the public. Teams are chosen to participate in two ways. The first way is an automatic bid, which is given to the 32 teams that win their conference’s championship. The second option is an at-large bid. These teams are chosen by the selection committee after regular season and conference tournaments based on merit and their performance thus far. This is how the remaining 36 teams are chosen.
March 13–March 14: First Four
These are the first four games of the tournament. They are played between the four lowest seeded automatic bid teams and the four lowest-seeded at-large bid teams. These games are usually played a few days after Selection Sunday and determine which of the eight teams playing will advance to the first round of the tournament.
March 15–March 25: The Madness
This is the time for the rest of the games of the tournament to unfold. Teams go head-to-head until a final four is chosen from the Midwest, West, South, and East Regional games. The Final Four compete on March 31 and April 2.
Teams to Watch
Michigan State University
With a solid effective field goal percentage and the No. 7 defense, Michigan State University is a solid contender in this year’s tournament. The Spartans won 12 straight games since their at home loss to rival University of Michigan on Jan. 13 until their loss to the Wolverines again, last Saturday in the Big Ten tournament. Players such as sophomore point guard Cassius Winston, with the  highest percentage of long-range shots in Division I, make this team one to watch.
However, there is some off-court drama with sophomore Miles Bridges and his mother, both of whom are facing federal charges for corruption in college basketball that threatened to interfere with game-play. Despite being cleared, Bridges’ performance has not been as strong since.
Purdue University
As one of the best shooting teams in the country, the Purdue University Boilermakers are a powerhouse team coming into March Madness. They have five players with a 38 percent or higher hit rate outside of the three-point line. Purdue also boasts one of the best Big Ten players, sophomore Carsen Edwards. Seniors Isaac Haas, Vince Edwards, and Dakota Mathias are also strong players averaging at least 12 points per game.
Even if they lose the Big Ten tournament crown to Michigan on Sunday night, this team will still be a force to be reckoned with. After two losses at the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament, Purdue has managed 19 consecutive wins and ranks very highly in offensive and defensive efficiency.
Ohio State University
Another team to watch is the Ohio State University Buckeyes who earlier in the season did not seem to be very favorable or begin with a lot of buzz. After replacing longtime head coach Thad Matta with Chris Holtmann, the Buckeyes did not fare well, bringing in only 17 wins and a 7-11 record.
Ohio State has been able to come back by defending well in the three-point arc. This is the one thing they have going for them coming into the tournament. It will be interesting to see how far this solid defense is able to carry them.
March Madness is fun: it allows those with college allegiances to root for their team around the country, and others to turn on the television and choose a team. For players, this is an opportunity to fulfill their dreams, or become a star. Who will be this year’s tournament Cinderella story?
Hopefully, this was helpful for those unfamiliar with March Madness and a good reminder for those who are gearing up for another month of March and the madness that comes with it.

The Pittsburgh Penguins are hot, even after a recent streak of three bad games. Before the three losses, the Pens won six in a row, beating tough, potential playoff teams like the Los Angeles Kings, Toronto Maple Leafs, and the Columbus Blue Jackets. The Penguins put up four or more goals in five of those six wins and looked as dominant as they ever have.
The Pens dropped the last three games to the Florida Panthers, New Jersey Devils, and Boston Bruins, mostly due to lackluster goaltending from backups Casey DeSmith and Tristan Jarry, who were forced to step up after starting goalie Matt Murray sustained a concussion in practice. The defense also seemed lost on the ice, with defenseman Matt Hunwick looking particularly rough on the ice. They looked like they were in a bit of a spring slump, but that all changed Saturday night.
The Pens beat out the New York Islanders in overtime on Saturday in a bounce-back victory that saw trade deadline acquisition Derick Brassard score his first goal as a Penguin. It was marked by a strong performance by Tristan Jarry, although he had a shaky start when he let in the first goal after tripping in front of the crease. He recovered and looked as dominant as he did before his string of a few bad games. Sidney Crosby put in the overtime winner against the Isles to cap off an important win.
The win against the Islanders saw a shake-up in the lineup. Fourth line Carter Rowney was scratched in exchange for youngster Dominik Simon, and defenseman Matt Hunwick was scratched in favor of Chad Ruhwedel. The Pens looked stronger, with the whole fourth line playing significantly better and the defense looking much stronger.
This recovery from the last three losses was a welcome relief for Pens fans. The trade deadline deal General Manager Jim Rutherford made to bring Brassard to the team looked good but losing shot-blocking defenseman Ian Cole seemed to be a big problem for the Pens in those last three losses, where the Penguins’ defense looked like it reverted to the way it was in late 2017.
The Penguins also lost enforcer Ryan Reaves, who brought a huge locker room presence to the team and seemed to be heating up in his last few games as a Penguin. Fortunately, the Penguins have bounced back and looked solid enough to make a deep playoff run and potentially defend their back-to-back Stanley Cup Championship titles.

“Tyler Childers, country singer.” That was about all the information I had on the up-and-coming musician before attending Childers’ concert at Stage AE this past Friday night. The name and label I had been given seemed common enough, preparing me for a smooth voice, a pair of cowboy boots, and a combination of sad love songs and upbeat odes to small towns and denim-short-wearing girls. But as I listened to Childers’ debut album, Purgatory, throughout the night, I was confronted instead with a gritty croon, flannel shirt, and stories of Kentucky, whisky, and hard times.  
Childers was the perfect performer for a steel city like Pittsburgh; the singer-songwriter grew up with a coal mining father, and his voice and lyrics are Appalachia strong. Late Friday night, the line for Childers’ show wound its way around the block. Childers’ working class narratives and unique mix of folk, country, and bluegrass brought in an eclectic audience, from young couples and friends, to entire families, to older couples pushing their way onto the floor for a spot in the front row. The rising anticipation before Childers took the stage was nothing in comparison to the excitement and enthusiasm that met the singer as he began his set. 
He may be new to the music scene, but Childers already boasts a loyal fan base. Listeners young and old matched each song with their own renditions of the lyrics and whistled at their favorite lines. As Childers strummed the first few notes of his song, “Deadman’s Curve,” the audience erupted in shouts of recognition and rose to meet the opening lyrics, shouting, “You can go to hell my dear, you’d probably like it better there” as Childers smiled wryly. 
While Childers released an earlier album entitled “Bottles and Bibles” in 2011, his 2017 release Purgatory truly announces his emergence as a formidable musician with a carefully crafted sound. The narratives Childers weaves over the course of the album tell a story informed by his experiences growing up in Kentucky, shifting from a restless youth to a settled man. 
There’s an authenticity and honesty in Childers' lyrics that you don’t often see in the music industry. Childers knows who he is and where he comes from, unashamedly sharing the mistakes he’s made and lessons he’s learned. He’s not a flashy performer, but a storyteller that reaches out to the common man. The poetry of his songwriting is reminiscent of the early Irish songs that first came to Appalachia, but the interweaving of Childers’ modern experiences with drugs, moonshine, religion, and love make his brand of mountain music more current and relatable.
There’s a dark humor to Childers' music, found in both the lyrics and the marriage of darker themed songs with foot-stomping rhythms. It’s hard not to let a smile creep over your face at the sound of the joyful fiddle in the background, even as Childers sings about his certainty in the existence of Hell or the time he showed up at his girlfriend’s house too stoned to get back home. Throughout the night, audience members laughed out loud and took to open corners on the floor to kick their boots and dance along.  
As a performer, Childers seems much older than his 26 years. He boasts a mature, clear voice and a mix of heartfelt, sometimes heartbreaking, lyrics. Musically, Childers isn’t messing around. The band and the music itself are just as integral and finely considered as Childers’ lyrics. As he performed, Childers focused wholly on the musical experience, pouring emotion into his words and giving his band mates time to shine.  
The strength of Purgatory’s music and storytelling is due in part to the industry legends Childers has in his corner. Sturgill Simpson, the Grammy-award-winning musician, was impressed by Childers’ demo and offered to co-produce the album. With the help of his friend and acclaimed sound engineer, David Ferguson, Simpson brought together Childers’ band and helped Childers hone in on his craft. 
It seems that Childers has performed the seemingly impossible task of returning country to its roots, to a place of storytelling and pride that appeals to all. It’s a feat that translates well on stage as well as on the charts. Upon its release Purgatory took the top spot on Billboard’s Heatseekers chart, rose to number 17 on the Country chart, and number four on the Americana/Folk chart. For a debut album, Childers has accomplished the truly remarkable, and the authenticity of his sound guarantees continued success on the horizon. 
That mountain music sound carried the audience through the night on an emotional and enjoyable journey. Childers closed the show with “Lady May,” a timeless love song about a woman who brings spring into the life of a toughened man who promises to love her well. It’s an incredibly earnest piece reminiscent of summer and tenderness that led audience members to lean into each other and sing along. 
Before the show, I’d wondered what it was about Childers and his music that made his work appealing to so many different groups of people. As I listened to Childers’ near whisper of the closing lines of “Lady May” and watched the blue glint of the spotlight on the rapt faces of the audience, it became clear that Childers shares a portrait of America that we rarely get to see. One where people work hard and still have rough days, where people make mistakes on their way to true love, and where people are proud of where they come from and the faults they carry with them. 
When the lights came up and the crowds filtered out into the cold, it seemed everyone left with a smile on their face, whistling the fiddle’s tune and carrying Childers’ words out into the night. 
"Now I ain't the toughest hickory
That your ax has ever felled
But I'm a hickory just as well
I'm a hickory all the same
I came crashin' through the forest
As you cut my roots away
And I fell a good long ways
For my lovely Lady May"

“Warholian Garage Rock. Surf Rockcandy. Your favorite band’s favorite band.”
Meet *repeat repeat, a Nashville-based band presenting a swirl of grunge rock and California surf pop. 
The husband-and-wife duo Jared and Kristyn Corder released their first album Bad Latitude in 2014, and are back with their sophomore release Floral Canyon. Aiming to mix the steely close-harmonies of 1960-70s California pop with New York’s edgy punk rock, the band has something to offer to any music lover.
While their previous album Bad Latitude spoke on the experiences of the duo’s engagement, Floral Canyon reflects a number of the band’s experiences. From the sunny beginning of new love to the tumultuous nature of relationships, the album creates a blend of “bloom, doom, and boom.” “Girlfriend,” their debut single for the album, perfectly represents this sound: it’s a loud and crashy song about sweet love. 
Here to talk more about the about themselves and the album is *repeat repeat. Jared’s responses will be represented by a “J” and Kristyn’s will be represented by a “K”.
I read in another article that your band name “*repeat repeat” came from a shampoo bottle! Could you talk a little bit more about your inspiration for the name?
J: Coming up with a solid band name is tough now! Once you think of something that in your mind is unique, a simple Google search will leave you feeling unoriginal. I saw the shampoo bottle, and it included the punctuation *repeat, repeat. So in the beginnings of the band, we used the asterisk & the comma. Two punctuation marks in a band name was too much. We almost immediately dropped the comma and kept the asterisk. It inadvertently works in our favor in show listings because we often get listed first, although that wasn’t the goal.
How do you want *repeat repeat to stand out from the music scene?
J: Kristyn (my wife and bandmate) always reminds me that in this business “there’s room for everybody” and I think about that a lot. I’m not too concerned with standing out as much as I am with being at the same table as the bands I love. I do think what sets us apart is our love for each other, our never ending hard work and willingness to eat sleep and breathe the music and all the moving parts behind it - and making music that is unpretentious tells a story and is relatable.
This idea of “blending opposites” is evident in your musical style: it’s a swirl of grunge/rock and California surf pop. Has this idea emerged in other aspects of this album or your music in general?
K: I think we come by that juxtaposition naturally.  Even if I don’t directly intend to, I think I usually bring the retro vibe and that’s because it will always be my favorite style of music (and clothes, and art...) so I can’t escape it, and because we both have strong ties to California culture - Jared was born there, and I spent almost 10 years living there myself besides having a big family from there and visiting often (from Texas, where my dad had moved by the time I was born). We love the harmony-heavy, surf-inspired sound but can’t live without loud, crunchy guitars and a little bit of spookiness. The irony is we definitely consider ourselves an East Coast band and have come up as a band entirely on the East Coast. ...So go figure.
What is it about the 1960-70s aesthetic that inspires you?
K: My dad was from a family of seven siblings in Long Beach, California. He and his brothers were typical SoCal surfers of the 1960s — up at dawn surfing before school started — listening to The Mamas and the Papas, The Beach Boys, Everly Brothers — but also bands like The Beatles, The Kinks, and others from the U.K. He taught me to have a deep appreciation for that era and style of music, and from there the rest followed. The Beatles' girlfriends/wives and Carnaby Street fashion models were my muses. The color palettes are so, um, groovy. I’ve always loved sixties style, and the analog often psychedelic sounds, and the loud, colorful art. That beachy, harmony driven surf-inspired pop sound — and the London / New York City mod or Britpop culture blend together in a way that I find basically irresistible. 
That overall aesthetic and peace/love/sunshine vibe has always been a big part of who I am and I think Jared could get into it and see why when we met and started dating.  He had a latent retro rock quality to him being from the West coast himself, listening to bands like Weezer and Green Day — but he wasn’t raised on the music that came before his own time which I had almost entirely been raised on, so we had to unearth the influences of his influences a little bit before we found our own sound.
How does Floral Canyon differentiate from your debut album Bad Latitude? (In terms of goal/message, working with a label, etc.) Were there other album titles you were considering?
J: Bad Latitude was my love-tribute to meeting Kristyn. I wrote it when we started dating, through our wedding, so each song is about a piece of my life intertwining with hers. With Floral Canyon we knew two things were certain before making the record: that we would touch on more themes and allow ourselves to write about other aspects of life than we had on our first album, and that it would be called "Floral Canyon" (haha). We had that name picked out a year before we wrote the record. Floral Canyon was the beginning of a transition for me and my songwriting where I started writing songs that I felt had a deep meaning to me but also could be relatable in many ways to the listener.
Your website features the phrase, “*repeat repeat creates their own geography to match their sound.” Considering that Floral Canyon is a play on California’s Laurel Canyon, what about these locations (CA, NY, or Nashville) inspired you to create your own space within the music community?
J: Indie rock coming out of Nashville had its own distinct sound when we were making the record. Bands like The Black Keys, Jack White, Jeff the Brotherhood, and Bully all culminated in a feverish lo-fi urgency that we wanted to take apart and make our own. We are also obsessed with the 1960s mod culture of New York style and the Warholian era, so we wanted to capture that style and mysticism in our own music. Kristyn’s inherited upbringing in the surf sounds of California made big beachy harmonies inevitable. Our music at it’s best is an amalgam of all of those styles and nostalgic vibes.
What is your fondest memory of the making of this album?
J: The last day in the studio, we had to touch up a few vocal tracks. We had just done 16 songs in two weeks and were exhausted. We got sick the night before and sang on the tracks with a cold. Our vocals, being relaxed, slow, gave the notes we were singing more of a groovy feel. It sounded great on the recordings. So the producer and engineer ended up having us sing every song on every track over again in that one day. They ended up being our best vocal takes. Sometimes those things just work out in a funny way.
How are you feeling about this tour and being able to perform at huge festivals like South by Southwest (SWSX) and Bonnaroo?
K: We feel prepared, and excited to continue supporting the new album since it came out right before the Winter hibernation. It feels like a complete dream to be playing the festivals we have coming up! And honestly, it even still feels like a dream to have played Forecastle, Firefly, and SXSW last year now that I think about it. Bonnaroo being our “hometown festival” and feeling like we’ve grown up in its shadow and are now playing is a feeling that I can only describe as surreal and greatful. We’re pumped to go back to SXSW - we had a great time last year and it always leaves us with a feeling of accomplishment (and exhaustion!). Shaky Knees we are thrilled for because the lineup is right up our alley and our favorite band is playing (Alvvays), so we are playing and then hanging out for the weekend and staying at one of our favorite hotels in the country. And, Sloss Fest in Birmingham is a personal favorite of ours for really a whole list of reasons, starting with the branding and design, to the lineup, to the “old factory” location, and they are super sweet and supportive to bands online, which always feels warm and fuzzy.  We can’t wait and hope the festivals keep coming.
What’s coming up for the band that you’re most excited about?
J: Lots of touring, even more festivals. Bonnaroo, Shaky Knees in Atlanta, Sloss Fest in Birmingham. We’re putting out another single at the end of March and going back in the studio this winter to work on LP 3. I’m most excited about the news songs I have been writing, evolving our sound with this next record, and some surprises we have planned for our Bonnaroo set.
And, lastly, a question for personal curiosity: what’s it like to live with 11 animals?
K: Haaa. It’s the best! Oh man, they are a trip. There is a seamlessness that our crew has that almost makes them like a pack, so they work with and around each other (and the near-constant Roomba) with love and respect. Cats snuggle dogs, the parrot tells us all what to do and when to do it. They are all rescues and several of them have crazy backstories and/or special needs. I have always had horses since I was a child so we have an adopted ex-racehorse whom we adore - and between his incredible care facility that is top-notch and our amazing beloved friends that take over the collective love-fest that is the other 10 in the house —  when we tour, we truly owe them the world!  It takes patience, cleanliness, Amazon Prime, and an inability to see yourself doing life in any other way.
For those interested, *repeat repeat will be on tour this spring/summer, coming to Pittsburgh’s Club Cafe on Friday, March 9. 
As for me, I’ll be listening to Floral Canyon on *repeat repeat.

Saturdays are perfect for brunch. After a tiring week of classes, assignments, and responsibilities, we’ve finally reached the best day of the week. Though I always regret it, I always push off my homework until Sunday, and I know I’m not alone. It’s not uncommon to find me still in bed, late into the afternoon (I have no shame about this).
But I think I’ve found a place that’s worth getting up (relatively) early on a Saturday for brunch. Geppetto Café is a quaint little place on Butler Street in Lawrenceville. The 93 bus will take you straight there on weekdays, but it’s a little harder to get to on weekends. The 93 doesn’t run on weekends, which are the most common times college students will have brunch. But like getting up early, the trip via the 54 bus and a little walking is well worth it.
From the outside, the café doesn’t look like much, a small hole in the wall with a gray sign. But, the sign also displays its logo: a hand holding a marionette, wires holding up a cup of coffee with the café’s name on it. The moment I entered, my mind jogged back to childhood memories of Disney movies, specifically Pinocchio, created by woodcarver Geppetto.
The interior is whimsical. There are several things hanging from the ceiling. In one section, books are suspended from strings. In another, small colorful umbrellas hang over customers enjoying a meal. Above the main counter, the lights are encased in mason jars. Against the simple white-painted brick wall are miniature wooden puppets — Pinocchios.
The menu is made up of American breakfast meals with European influences: crêpes from France, waffles from Belgium, and paninis from Italy. They have a wide selection of savory crêpes, with a range of choices for different tastes in cheese, vegetables, and meats. On the sweet side, entrees are available as crêpes or waffles, made with a variety of fruits and syrups topped with whipped cream. The menu also offers French toast, paninis, and salads.
My friend and I were in the mood for crêpes, and decided to try one savory and one sweet, and split them. For the savory, we settled on the Love Hate Thing, made with smoked turkey, goat cheese, avocado, and béchamel sauce. For the sweet, we chose the Merry Berry, made with Nutella and fresh strawberries.
The savory crêpe was delicious, with the cheese and avocado blending well but not overpowering the mellow flavor of the turkey. I’d never had a crepe with avocado, and it was a nice surprise. Savory crêpes also come with a simple side salad with a light vinaigrette, which went well with the crêpe.
There’s not much to say about the sweet crêpe: you can’t go wrong with Nutella and strawberries, and whipped cream on top of that. It was the breakfast to the savory crêpe’s lunch. Both crêpes themselves were thin and delicate, fried with a nice crisp finish.
I can say that they were easily the best crêpes I’ve had in Pittsburgh. The service was quick and non-intrusive, and the place is relatively affordable for Lawrenceville and for crêpes. However, it gets busy very quickly, especially on Saturdays. We arrived at 10 a.m., only an hour after opening, and it was already very crowded. By the time we left before noon, the place was packed. Go early, or be prepared to wait a couple minutes for a table.
In my second year at Carnegie Mellon, I’ve been branching out of the typical Oakland and Squirrel Hill food options, trying places in East Liberty, the Strip District, and of course, Lawrenceville. Geppetto Café has definitely been added as my go-to brunch restaurant of choice.

This past Saturday, crowds flocked to Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall for the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA) Central Quarterfinal, eager to see the nine teams sing it out for the chance to move on to the ICCA Semifinals in Buffalo in three weeks time (and hopefully have a shot at making it to the finals in New York in April). With nine teams at the competition, three from Carnegie Mellon and six from the University of Pittsburgh, the auditorium was packed and buzzing with excitement as we all waited to see our beloved classmates, neighbors, and rivals take the stage.
First up was C# from Carnegie Mellon. Starting with 2AM Club’s “Worry About You,” I was immediately impressed by the way the group made the song their own. Next, they performed the classic Elvis Presley hit, “Can’t Help Falling in Love.” With big shoes to fill, the group did not disappoint, harmonizing beautifully and singing with passion and emotion. Lastly, they closed with C#’s signature mashup of Ariana Grande songs. Blending together “Greedy,” “Dangerous Woman,” “Leave Me Lonely,” and “Sometimes,” I was impressed by the powerful lead throughout the performance and the backing vocals of the rest of the group, with the potential to rival Grande herself.
Pitches and Tones, the first University of Pittsburgh team of the night, was the next to perform. Immediately, I recognized the strength of the Pitt students’ choreography. Beginning with a mashup of “Feeling Good” by Michael Bublé and “Start a Fire” by John Legend, the group showcased some powerful vocals, and only continued to awe the audience with a rendition of Rihanna’s “Sledgehammer.” Pitches and Tones only continued to shine, commanding the stage with their choreography and filling the room with their intense vocals. Lastly, they closed with an emotional, but not quite as impressive mashup of “What is Love” from the show Empire and “Green Light” by Lorde.
Carnegie Mellon was back with the Treblemakers. Returning again this semester with MisterWives’ “Machine,” they once again proved themselves to be formidable opponents in the a cappella circuit. The vocal percussion throughout their set was particularly incredible. Continuing with “Love So Soft” by Kelly Clarkson, the group did not fail to deliver another stellar performance. Last, they closed with an emotional and raw cover of Kesha’s “Praying.”
Next, the Pitt Pendulums performed decently, first with Disclosure’s “Magnets” and then Jon Bellion’s “The Good in Me.” While their first performance was good, it was definitely not my favorite of the night. While they picked up momentum with a fantastic lead with a wide vocal range in Bellion’s song, their final song was by far their best. Miley Cyrus’ “FU” was an interesting choice, but they performed it with great power and fervor and truly engaged the audience with the more upbeat song.
University of Pittsburgh's all-male group, Pitch Please, closed the first half of the show fervently. Their entertaining choreographing and extreme vocal ranges really drew the audience in, with performances of “Good Things Come to Those Who Wait” by Nathan Sykes, “Jealous” by Labrinth, and “Hit Me” by Dirty Loops. They were strong in their vocal consistency, each of them with an impressive set of pipes.
After a short intermission, Sounds Like Treble, one of the University of Pittsburgh’s all-female group, started the second half strong. Their mashup of Imogen Heap’s “Hide and Seek” and Bishop Briggs’ “The Way I Do” exhibited strong choreography and vocals from all, with no clear lead in “Hide and Seek” and a strong and distinct lead throughout “The Way I Do.” They then took on Gnarls Barkley’s “Crazy,” and finished with a beautiful performance of Little Mix’s “Secret Love Song.”
Immediately after, University of Pittsburgh’s C Flat Run immediately reigned supreme on the stage, capturing the audience’s attention immediately with their intense, synchronized choreography and their extremely strong vocals, showcasing their superiority among the groups. With a rich and powerful mashup of Alabama Shakes’ “Gimme All Your Love” and Donald Glover’s “Redbone,” followed by a pure and harmonious performance of Frances’ “Grow,” and closing with a mashup of Rihanna’s “Desperado” and Jay-Z’s “Run This Town,” C Flat Run truly managed to highlight all of their strengths through the different styles and genres they chose.
The last University of Pittsburgh group for the night, the Songburghs, were definitely not least. While C Flat Run was a difficult act to follow, the Songburghs continued to capture the audience with their dramatic, eye-catching choreography. Throughout all of their songs, the choreography seemed to tell a story and take their performance to new heights. With incredible beatboxing and a unique lead on NEEDTOBREATHE’s “Money and Fame,” the group finished with Rag’n’Bone Man’s “Wolves” and then Begonia’s “Out of My Head,” exploring a wide range of tones, pitches, and styles, and succeeding in every way.
Finally, the night closed with Carnegie Mellon’s all-female a cappella group, Counterpoint. With the most emotionally potent performance of the night, the group started with intensity. Their rendition of Wrabel’s “The Village” was hauntingly beautiful, and they utilized the stage well with simple but effective choreography. Next was Radiohead’s “Creep,” followed by the fun and upbeat MisterWives’ song, “Reflections,” accompanied by some fabulous beatboxing and choreography.
All in all, the nine groups were mesmerizing to watch. However, only two could make it to the next leg of the competition. Before the judges returned and the official results were announced, there was a performance by CMU Jiya, an all-girls Bollywood fusion dance group, and an impromptu beatbox battle between some of the a cappella groups. While all beatboxers hyped up the crowd, the fan favorites were from the Songburghs and Pitch Please.
While Carnegie Mellon’s groups are near and dear to our hearts and fought valiantly, unfortunately the University of Pittsburgh came out on top. With C Flat Run winning in the outstanding soloist, outstanding arrangement, and outstanding choreography categories, it was pretty clear before the results were announced which group the judges liked best. Carnegie Mellon Treblemaker Derek Brown, however, deservedly won the award for outstanding vocal percussion. Two University of Pittsburgh teams will move onto the semifinals in late March: the Quarterfinal champions, C Flat Run, and the runner-up, the Songburghs (who tied for best choreography). While it was disappointing to not see Carnegie Mellon teams move on to the next round, the ICCA Central Quarterfinal was overall a major success and an exciting event to attend, with immensely talented singers and vocal percussionists across the board.

This week I decided to opt for brunch over a bar. I wasn’t up for all the crazy people you meet at the bar and let’s face it, I was hungry. So, I found myself in Lawrenceville at Coca Café, a small restaurant whose breakfast packs quite the punch. This place boasts a ton of five star Yelp reviews, and after my visit I can definitely see why.
The location: Situated at the edge of Lower Lawrenceville, Coca Café is in the perfect hipster brunch location. The wait was quite a while but there was plenty to do and see as we roamed the gentrified streets. This location also puts you a nice distance away from campus, if that’s what you’re going for. Many students know about Lawrenceville but often don’t find themselves making it past Shadyside when considering brunch options.
The vibe: The restaurant itself is very small. I could probably count the number of tables on my two hands. This seems to be a trend for Pittsburgh restaurants though, so I did not find this terribly surprising. The decor and vibe was a bit whimsical and playful. There’s also some interesting art on the wall that you can’t help but look at.
The food: It is a café, so they also boast an extensive coffee and drink menu with something for everyone. Of course what you came to read about was the food, and it did not disappoint. One thing I liked about Coca Café was the portion sizes. They were filling and very manageable. I wasn’t overwhelmed with an IHOP style portion of food.
I had the challah french toast with melted brie, fig jam, and berries. I never knew how well brie went with sweet things until I tried this. It was the perfect balance of sweet but not too sweet and the brie was literally the icing on top (it was melted and kind of spread like icing too). Also, figs are not a terribly sweet fruit so it was a perfect balance. I wish I could have tried more things on the menu, because, while I opted for sweet, there were some strong savory options. There were also a few silly options, like the french toast covered in Cap’n Crunch cereal.
Lit or Nah: I don’t know how well this particular category pertains to brunch, but I’m going to say nah. Don’t get me wrong, the food was amazing and the place is definitely worth the trip, but it was a very calm brunch outing featuring a lot more families than millennials. I’m not sure if I need my brunch places to be over the top lit anyways. Overall, it was a quality restaurant, with some good food and fair prices, that I will definitely be visiting again.

Dear Izzy,
I’ve been having, well, sort of a really weird, deep problem lately. Ever since I’ve come to college, I’ve made a ton of new friends and have gotten the chance to open up to people and just grow as a person. But, I feel like I am spending too much time with them. To rephrase it, I feel like I haven’t been able to spend time with myself lately. I used to be a completely different, shy person in high school. That changed almost immediately once I got to college, went through Orientation Week, and met a lot of my current friends (just part of the typical freshman experience). I don’t know why I’ve lately began to feel like I’ve lost touch with myself. It seems especially weird, since I’m halfway through my second semester, so you’d think I’d have enough time to process this because Orientation Week was so long ago and I’ve had at least one semester under my belt. And, it’s not like I don’t appreciate my friends; maybe I’m just having a hard time balancing a social life since I’ve never really had one before. Is there anything you can recommend I do?
From,
Missing Every Time Introvert Mindset Exists
Dear ME TIME,
It’s awesome to hear how much you’ve blossomed and grown in college already, and that you seem to be going through a smooth transition! That fact alone can be surprisingly comforting in hard times, and I’m glad you’ve built up a strong support network that you can fall back on if you need to. However, I will agree that taking time for yourself is important too.
Every week, try to find some time — it doesn’t have to be long, and can be from 10 minutes to three hours — to just spend with yourself. Take a step back from everything going on in your life and focus on YOU: what do you specifically want to do in that moment? What do you enjoy doing? If it’s watching Netflix, great. If it’s reading Harry Potter for the 13th time, great. Heck, even if it’s doing work, that’s fine too, as long as it’s something you enjoy doing by yourself. I’ve been setting aside some time to plan out my schedule for the future, and it’s a great trick for laying out any personal goals and staying on top of things.
The question on how to balance your social life is a little bit harder to answer, because honestly, I’m still going through this myself. Sometimes it’ll help to just analyze your week and sort of assess how you spend your time on work, friends, and on yourself. From there, you can then move on to adjust your organization of time as necessary. Just remember too that you are defining your own balance, and make sure to be a fair judge for yourself. And hopefully, after looking at your schedule, you’ll be able to carve out the me time that you definitely deserve.
Hope this helps!
Izzy

Academic Development started in the summer of 1997 and consisted of only one full time employee and one graduate student. Today, it reaches thousands of students each year, and employs more than 200 students, in addition to the five full-time employees that keep Academic Development running. In honor of Academic Development’s 20th anniversary, The Tartan sat down with four of its full time employees in order to discuss how Academic Development has changed, the services that they provide the student body, and where they think Academic Development will grow from here.
These four employees were the director of Academic Development Linda Hooper, who was the founding full time employee, John Lanyon, the Peer Tutor Program Coordinator, Jessica Owens, the Supplemental Instruction (SI) and EXCEL Program Coordinator, and Mike Poljak, the Academic Coaching Program Coordinator. The fifth and final full time employee was Administrative Assistant Donora Craighead.
Academic Development was originally located in the Student Center, a navy building that was located where the Gates Hillman Complex currently stands. Director Linda Hooper described it as “basically a long trailer.” She, with a graduate student acting as her assistant, worked out of a mail room while all other tutoring happened in the room next to them. “I’d be working with a student, and they’d be crying about something, we would be dealing with a sensitive subject, and all these students would be coming to get their mail,” said Hooper of the situation.
Academic Development is currently located in Cyert Hall, a far cry from their original home in the Student Center, with offices for the Program Directors and rooms for peer tutors and academic coaches to meet with the students they are helping out. And this change in space has come with a drastic increase in the services Academic Development offers. “Because we have adapted to student need, every single year we have had growth in all of our programs almost across the board,” Hooper said.
This growth can be seen very starkly in the statistics of the programs. Walk-in tutoring supported 15 subjects in two locations, Donner House and Mudge House, in 2003. This past year, 33 subjects had walk-in tutoring sessions in seven locations. EXCEL groups supported 27 courses last year, compared to 11 courses in the 2007-2008 academic year. Poljak was hired two and a half years ago as the first full time employee in his position as Academic Coaching Program Director, and last year 77 percent of all students enrolled in SI supported courses attended SI sessions, according to the annual report.
Poljak said he is often asked why there is such a clear enthusiasm for Academic Development’s services at Carnegie Mellon, given that the students are ones who presumably are capable and intelligent. He suggests that Academic Development’s growth stems from the fact that students are so academically successful, “Your intelligence is making you say I need to gobble up all that support... and it’s our job to make sure it’s readily available.”
The staff of Academic Development gives a lot of credit to their more than 200 student employees as well. Owens, SI and EXCEL Program Coordinator, found that the student employees are what “keep [her] going.” She highlighted that student employees “maintain their own academics, and they work really really hard to help the people around them. They have that unique experience where they can actually share that experience with students and interpret things in a way that is meaningful, really connecting with the student’s questions.”
Lanyon, Peer Tutor Program Coordinator, stressed that not only do student employees benefit from working with Academic Development, the full time employees benefit from working with the student employees and use their input to shape the programs. He states that when people frequently ask him if he is tired of his job after the sixteen years he has spent working here,“I have to laugh when I hear that question because the answer is an emphatic no... what other job can you have where you can interact with so many different people coming from so many different cultural backgrounds, so many different educational backgrounds, so many socio-economic backgrounds?”
The student employees juggle heavy workloads, balancing classwork and their Academic Development jobs, but the full-time employees more than match that work ethic and enthusiasm for learning. Hooper said of her program coordinators, “These three people work harder than anyone you have seen on this campus.” Poljak quipped that sometimes he thinks that there are “two Donoras” because of the massive amount of work Administrative Assistant Donora Craighead handles each week.
The Tartan asked the four employees what their aspirations for the next 20 years of Academic Development are. Hooper stated that her goal for the expansion of Academic Development would be to hire more personnel to expand on the work that the current staff is completing. Owens lit up at the prompt, confiding that her aspiration is that Academic Development owns its place as the program that teaches students how to learn. Poljak talked about expanding the services they offer to graduate students. John Lanyon said that, given that they had the resources to do so, he would like it if they would “strategically expand our programs into other colleges and majors” as a lot of the tutoring is currently aimed at the math and science courses that have higher drop rates.
Though 20 is undoubtedly a significant anniversary for any group on campus, and surely signals that Academic Development is here to stay, they found themselves unable to celebrate so far this year. Though they had planned to do something to commemorate this occasion at the beginning of the year, Hooper explained, “We were too busy!”

As the topic of the right to freedom of speech continues to become increasingly controversial across the nation, former and current members of the Carnegie Mellon community gathered to discuss the campus policy at the Campus Deliberative Forum (CDF) on Free Speech, Inclusion, and Democracy co-hosted this past Saturday by the Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion and the Program for Deliberative Democracy. The discussion was comprised of several five-person focus groups with a panel discussion session toward the end of the conference.
The discussions started off with a conversation on what is defined as free speech. “We can’t have free speech without people abusing it. Where is the place we draw the line? What is considered racist? What is considered xenophobic?” said Richard Hoffberg, a junior majoring in Mechanical Engineering. Other focus groups discussed similar concepts. The general consensus seemed to be that, if there was a controversial topic or speaker, there needed to be discussion amongst people of all perspectives.
Another key topic that was introduced was the problem of undergraduate political apathy. An anonymous contributor claimed that “students don’t care about important topics unless they personally impact them or everyone is talking about them.”
Though the purpose of the forum was not to create solutions, many thought that requiring a basic civics course would alleviate some of the problems regarding participation. 
With over 20 percent of the student body with homes overseas, an introductory civics course entering the university would allow for a more diverse array of participants in student government and activism. In regards to international students, an anonymous graduate student explained that there are “different mechanisms for different groups, [for instance] Asian students are taught to stay obedient and not challenge loudly.”
The discussions became increasingly profound and intense. When it came time for discussion with the administrative panel, however, the conversations with detailed analysis came to a grinding halt. Though it is the role of the administrative representative to remain a neutral representative of the university and its interests, it was difficult for that role to manifest in a forum where position taking was necessary.
Dan Munsch, Assistant General Counsel at Carnegie Mellon, explained that “the right to speech is very broad. We are a private institution, we do not have to defend the first amendment, but we choose to.” Holly Hippensteel, Associate Vice President for Community Standards and Diversity Initiatives, when asked about the criteria for protected free speech, said that there is no “operational definition of creative inquiry. As we think about it, there has to be a mix of of intellectual and creative expression.”
And, if there was to be a highly controversial and divisive speaker, what would the university do if there were students who felt unsafe? Dean of Students and Vice President for Student Affairs Gina Casalegno stated that students would naturally mobilize and get ready for the process of engagement. She evidenced the Westboro Baptist’s cameo on campus as a source for inspiration. “There were students who sang the hate away and also students who didn’t feel safe in the environment, so the university set up an event in the center for diversity.”
At the conference’s conclusion, the campus policy remained as vague as when it was first penned. But, the most important result of the conference most definitely was the engagements the participants could then spread to other students and faculty on campus.

Pittsburghers from Southside to East Liberty were held in suspense this week by the potential of a district-wide teacher’s strike, set to begin March 2, this past Friday. However, in a move that has been advantageous to all parties, the strike has been avoided and schools will remain open and functioning for the time being.
As of earlier last week, the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers, a teacher’s union, and the Pittsburgh School District were unable to reach a new contractual agreement, and a strike appeared to be imminent. But, after extensive debate, a tentative agreement has been reached.
If a strike were to have occurred, 25,000 students across 54 district schools wouldn’t have been able to go to class. Around 3,000 total teachers, paraprofessionals, police officers, and other school faculty are union members, so a strike would have left the entire district without proper schooling.
Nina Esposito-Visgitis, the president of the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers, told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that negotiations to prevent this took “14 hours straight” but that she is “happy that we were able to [reach an agreement] for our educators and our parents and our students.”
Esposito-Visgitis, the rest of the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers executive board, and the board of the Pittsburgh School District may have spent countless hours reaching this accord, but the overall strife has been going on for far longer than just this past week’s debate. Discussions related to this conflict began in Aug. 2016, when the union and district barely reached an agreement to extend their contracts, citing disagreements on Pennsylvania’s education budget.
Later, on Oct. 19, 2017, grievances over teacher’s scheduling, overfilled classes, and pay for early childhood teachers, were formally presented to district representatives. Discussions continued, with even a district-bourne contract being presented to the union, which was promptly vetoed by the teachers almost unanimously.
The agreement reached this past week clearly comes after long-standing disputes, but shows how important it was to both sides to prevent a strike. Esposito-Visgitis told WTAE Pittsburgh Action News, prior to the strike’s cancellation, that “our teachers want to stay in the classroom with their students, where they belong.”
Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto urged both sides to reach a consensus earlier in the week, stressing the gravity of the situation in saying, “When you’re in a situation like this, it affects the people, the students, their parents, and it’s going to have a devastating effect upon the city.”
The last time teachers held a strike in Pittsburgh was the infamous Dec. 1975 to Jan. 1976 strike, in which schools closed for two months while intense negotiations over pay raise, class size, student discipline, scheduling, and job security were carried out.
This story made national news at the time and prevented 62,300 students at 105 schools from going to school. Had the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers indeed held a strike this year, there’s no telling whether the situations would have been similar or not. Luckily, both the union and the district wanted the best for the community and were able to keep schools in operation.
While strikes are necessary tools of collective bargaining rights, the entire community, teachers and students alike, are likely grateful that the situation did not have to occur. Pittsburgh schools are to remain open, and while neither the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers or the Pittsburgh School District offered any details relating to their final contract, one can assume some degree of mutual benefit, and hope for its longevity.

Over spring break, a group of 13 Carnegie Mellon University students and a student from the Community College of Allegheny County, representing the Homewood Children’s Village, will travel to Puerto Rico to take part in an Alternative Spring Break program. The 10-day trip, from March 9 to March 18, will be spent helping local farmers rebuild and plant crops and meeting with government officials and local community leaders to learn about ways locals have struggled to survive after the disastrous effects of Hurricane Maria.
The trip is being led by Tiffany Taulton, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon’s Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy, Caroline Morin, a senior Chemical and Biomedical Engineering double-major, and Sterling Wells, a junior majoring in Decision Science.
Having spent her early childhood in Puerto Rico, Taulton was heartbroken to read about the damage caused by Hurricane Maria and knew that she needed to help. Last year, Taulton was one of many students to support Rosana Guernica, a junior Decision Science major, on her trip to deliver hospital supplies to the island and evacuate critical care patients. “It was an exciting moment to fly over Puerto Rico after such a long absence,” she says, reflecting on what it was like to revisit her childhood home. “The landscape of San Juan had changed a lot. And, it was shocking to see how many roofs were covered in sky blue tarp. I knew instinctively that the situation in the countryside would be even worse.”
Before traveling with Guernica, Taulton was planning to make a trip herself to the island, but put that on hold to help with that mission. However, because of her experience accompanying Guernica, she felt that she wanted to sustain the impact that the trip had on the island. “I began to think of how students from the College of Engineering, Tepper, and even those studying healthcare and psychology could learn from the trip.”
The Alternative Spring Break program is modeled after a similar trip that she participated in as an undergraduate at Georgetown University. “That trip focused on border relations between the U.S. and Mexico, and had a profound impact on my life — both in terms of my worldview and my career trajectory,” says Taulton. “I knew that students at Heinz could benefit from a similar experience, and that Puerto Rico could greatly benefit from having future government leaders that had formed a personal relationship with the island. Even if students never returned to Puerto Rico, or worked with the federal government on that level, they would benefit from the experience of understanding how climate change affects communities, and they would leave the trip with a better idea of both how to prevent and mitigate that suffering through good disaster management and climate resilient planning.”
Taulton eventually joined forces with Morin and Wells, who both also helped Guernica raise funds for her trip, and expressed interest in Taulton’s plan to conduct a longer mission on the island.
“After two months of struggling to connect with farmers by phone and on Facebook, and thinking about how difficult my second semester classes were expected to be, I was ready to give up,” says Taulton. “But, Caroline and Sterling both contacted me, asking if I was still going to do it and then volunteered to help me get it done. I told them that I would work with them for a week to see what we could get done, but if we couldn’t get the farm location settled, that would be the end of it. As luck would have it, phone calls and Facebook messages started going through and we were able to get the basic plan finished in that week!”
The trip will be spent helping Puerto Rican farmers plant crops and clean up their fields as well as helping the Puerto Rican economy by purchasing tours, project supplies, and lodging from local businesses that are struggling, as well as donating to organizations that they will be visiting to learn about their work.
“We have four foci for the tours: agroecology, solar power, land trusts and cooperatives,” says Taulton. “Basically, food and power, and how communities can help themselves in the absence of government assistance. We will also have one student from the Homewood Children’s Village accompanying us to see how these lessons can be applied to Homewood for people-centered, resilient, community development.”
Taulton hopes the trip will prepare students to serve the public in the fields of health policy, food policy, urban planning, and climate resilience, bring together the engineering and sustainability-focused programs of Carnegie Mellon University with those at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez and make sure that future government leaders in the U.S. mainland understand the effects that their healthcare, budget, and trade decisions can have on U.S. overseas territories.
Taulton finds that her biggest challenge may be dealing with unexpected obstacles, like power outages or water rationing. She stated, “I’m not worried, however, because the Puerto Rican people are extremely hospitable, and we have been virtually adopted by the faculty of the University of Puerto Rico. They have arranged housing, transportation, and even tours for us for several days of our trip.”
Although many Carnegie Mellon departments, donation drives, and outside sources have provided funding for the trip thus far, Taulton and her team still encourage anyone who is interested in helping their mission to donate to their fundraiser on YouCaring. They will also post pictures from the trip on their Facebook page. 
“Please help us to make a lasting impact during our trip by giving your financial support today and sharing our campaign widely!”

The Undergraduate Student Senate’s Internal Development committee has been focusing on the different ways we can give back to our Senators and show them that the work they do is valued. One of the ways we decided on was to create a Senator Spotlight.
The Senator Spotlight allows us to recognize Senators every two weeks for the various influential activities and initiatives they have completed. These Senators are brought up to the front of our general meetings and are given the recognition for the work they’ve done on behalf of the Senate. 
Two of the senators being recognized this spotlight are Alexandra Moy and Benjamin Johnson-Staub.
Moy has been recognized for the constant work she put in to the Campus Life committee, as well as the efforts made weekly to engage the student body by tabling for hours every Friday afternoon in the Cohon Center.
Johnson-Staub has also been recognized for this week’s Senator Spotlight. He is a dedicated member to the Senate and is responsible for the conversation with the administration regarding the add/drop deadline. You can contact them at acmoy@andrew.cmu.edu and benjamij@andrew.cmu.edu, respectively.
To personally get involved in Senate you can visit our general body meetings every Thursday at 5 p.m. in the Cohon Center Danforth Conference Room. During the first few minutes of every meeting, we allow for audience participation in which you can voice your concerns directly to your representatives. Senate is designed to support the students and to constantly work towards making the undergraduate experience a better one. We work hand in hand with various groups on campus to ensure the creation of a unified and collaborative campus.

Learning a language is difficult for anybody, especially learning one as complex as English. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that people make mistakes when writing, especially in a setting so fast-paced as social media. Sometimes spellcheck and autocorrect let us down. Other times, we might mess up on syntax. Regardless of the error, mistakes happen and most people are aware of that.
But what about pointing out grammatical errors as part of an argument?
On Twitter, a writer known as Your Fat Friend tweeted: “Reminder: unsolicited grammar policing disproportionately targets people with disabilities, poor folks, immigrants and people of color. If you can’t understand what someone is saying, ask clarifying questions. If you can, there’s no need to correct their grammar.”
To be fair, “grammar policing,” or notoriously pointing out grammar errors where irrelevant, is not a good tactic for a multitude of reasons. Grammar policing causes one to inadvertently state that proper spelling and grammar is more important than the actual topic at hand. In the time and character space spent on pointing out grammar, you could state your opinion and open up the discussion. Perhaps you might share an article supporting your argument. You could even scroll past the post and move on with your day. With all of these options open, there really appears to be no reason for one to needlessly point out an error.
To give an example of grammar policing in action, consider the following scenario: you saw a post pertaining to gun control that you disagree with. This post has several grammar errors scattered throughout, but you can still comprehend the main message and supporting arguments. You then type something along the lines of “you used the wrong ‘they’re’/‘there’/‘their.’” By pointing out this error that does not detract meaning from the message of the post, you possibly make yourself look elitist for boasting your ability to spell. Regardless of the content that follows, you still leave that first impression and inadvertently state that you care more about spelling and grammar than you do about the topic at hand. In the time and character space that you took to type your comment, you could have provided a link to a source that backs up your argument or challenges the post’s argument. Perhaps you might have stated your opinion and opened up discussion. You could even scroll past the post and move on with your day. With all of these options open, there really appears to be no reason for one to needlessly point out an error.
However, Your Fat Friend’s logic takes this a step further and argues that your “grammar policing” would be discriminatory against certain demographics. Perhaps she interprets it as an online version of laughing at one’s accent or the way one speaks, therefore discriminatory. While I can understand her sentiment, considering grammar policing to be discriminatory is a stretch. There are many words that can describe “unsolicited grammar policing:" inane, childish, and silly, to name a few. However, none of those adjectives inherently mean discriminatory.
Each generation, despite its many differences, appears to have a common sense of optimism. The groups of youth strive to advocate for their respective perception of social justice. In this day and age, political correctness is a prominent theme. Topics such as intersectionality, diversity, and inclusion are all rampant when it comes to determining what is or is not acceptable to say or do.
“-isms,” such as elitism, ableism, and racism are all, undoubtedly, legitimate problems that deserve attention. However, claiming grammar policing to be a part of any of those problems is a stretch. Even though people who share Your Fat Friend’s sentiment most likely have good intentions and want to combat discrimination, these intentions may do more harm to these demographics that they are trying to protect.
Loosely labeling seemingly innocuous actions as discriminatory, can make the meaning of “discriminatory” appear to lose its significance. For instance, the seeming overuse of the term “racism" causes some people to become dubious of the extent of racism’s existence. For instance, in the Olympics this year, a coin toss was determined to be the tie-breaker should there be two athletes of similar accomplishments who are equally qualified to represent the U.S. and bear the flag. This method was agreed upon across the board. However, when the coin toss fell against speedskater Shani Davis' favor, he tweeted: "I am an American and when I won the 1,000m in 2010 I became the first American to [two-peat] in that event. @TeamUSA dishonorably tossed a coin to decide its 2018 flag bearer. No problem. I can wait until 2022. #BlackHistoryMonth2018." By putting the hashtag, he blamed racism, not sheer chance, on the outcome. Now, his Twitter account is private, most likely due to the backlash and criticism that ensued.
There is no doubt we need to continue the dialogue on racism. However, is calling an event that occurred based on pure chance racist promoting fruitful dialogue on racism? No. Instead, we could look at policies that disproportionally affect certain racial demographics or reflect on our own racial biases that affect how we perceive others. Focusing on policies that disproportionally affects education accessibility and poverty rates would effectively help create an even playing field across demographics. Celebrating the accomplishments of various black people throughout the years would help empower the youth. Had Davis made the tweet of his accomplishments and left out his comment pertaining to the coin toss, he could have been a source of inspiration and the Black History Month hashtag would have been relevant. However, the fact that he brought up racism when it was irrelevant made it appear as though racism is not a serious issue anymore. It's the "cry wolf" effect in action. Just as the boy cried "wolf!" and nobody believed him when there was an actual wolf, people loosely crying out "racism" in situations where it isn't applicable are causing others to become disillusioned that there is no racism.
Similarly, we should look at "grammar policing" and not resort to social justice jargon where it isn't applicable. Claiming scrutinizing grammar where unapplicable is damaging to those with disabilities causes people to be desensitized to legitimate problems and policies that go against people with disabilities. Instead, we can demand healthcare programs to be accessible to those with disabilities and help reduce the stigma surrounding disabilities. Likewise, providing accessible education for the economically disadvantaged is far more productive than denouncing grammar policing as "attacking poor folks."
Our society has great room for improvement in terms of ensuring equity and quality of life for all people. However, calling out grammar policing to fight against discrimination against certain demographics can actually serve to be detrimental to those demographics. Instead, we should focus on dialogue pertaining to policies that affect people’s lives and call grammar policing what it is: silly.

The solution to America’s gun problem does not lie with teachers. Rather, it is the responsibility of policymakers to implement effective school safety measures. It is incredibly shortsighted to think that distributing more guns within schools will reduce the number of school shootings. Suggesting that teachers should be armed with guns reflects an avoidance of the real question of why school shootings are even able to happen in the first place and why they have been happening so frequently in the past few years. 
On Feb. 24, President Trump tweeted, “Armed Educators (and trusted people who work within a school) love our students and will protect them. Very smart people. Must be firearms adept & have annual training. Should get yearly bonus. Shootings will not happen again — a big [and] very inexpensive deterrent. Up to States.” According to The Guardian, if Trump’s proposal was taken literally, that would mean giving guns to about 718,000 teachers, which is almost the size of the army and navy combined. 
According to TIME Trump’s proposal is a “quick and cheap solution to a difficult and expensive problem” for many reasons. Teachers are not trained to wield a weapon, and it most certainly is not in their job description. While teachers should protect their students by following standard safety protocol during a crisis, they are not responsible for shooting the attacker. That’s the police department’s job.
Even police officers have a difficult time “reacting to threats and properly executing the use of deadly force," says TIME. According to The New York Times, even trained police officers only hit their targets one-third of the time. During actual gunfights, their accuracy can be as low as 13 percent. So, how can teachers be expected to accurately wield a gun in high-stress situations like a school shooting? Instead of proposing that teachers should be trained to use a weapon, why not hire more police officers to protect students and spend more money on improving building safety measures? 
Additionally, teachers work in such close proximity with students that an incident with accidental discharge is almost guaranteed. Students and parents cannot be sure that the gun is securely locked away and completely inaccessible to students. They will live with constant uncertainty and “what ifs” due to the fear of the gun getting into the wrong hands. 
If a teacher owns a gun in the classroom, that also stands in the way of a positive teacher-student relationship. Teachers are mentors, advisors, guides, and confidants. The classroom is supposed to be a safe place. Students’ knowledge that their teacher owns a gun can paint an antagonistic picture of the teacher. Guns say "stand back", rather than "stand up". They will make students feel less safe around their teachers, and thus are not conducive to the teacher-student relationship. 
The most important question that Trump failed to consider before his thoughtless proposal to arm teachers is: How would the guns (and training) be paid for? According to The Guardian Trump proposed slashing five billion dollars from the Department of Education, and programs to pay for school counselors and violence prevention would be the first to go. In order to fund guns and training, he would have to increase the budget he so ardently wants to slash. The whole idea is ridiculous. Teachers don’t ask for much; they just want to be paid fairly and to have enough supplies in their classroom to educate their students effectively without paying for it themselves. It would be so much more helpful to increase funding for school supplies and mental health awareness programs than for guns. It is shameful that this needs to be spelled out for the President. 
Such a ludicrous proposition as arming teachers with guns lends itself to so many ethical and legislative questions. Who would be responsible if a teacher missed and shot the wrong person? What if a student gained access to the weapon? What if a teacher refused to wield the weapon? Do they have a choice? Should they be paid more due to this additional responsibility? The list goes on.
It’s common sense. You can’t fight fire with fire. That’s just not how it works. In order to eliminate school shootings, you cannot add more guns. Rather, we need to have stricter gun laws and perhaps even ammunition control. Research shows that gun availability increased "the rates of several violent crimes in a sample of cities across 39 countries.” Further research revealed that the number of guns per capita per country is a strong predictor of firearm-related deaths. The U.S. is late in realizing that gun availability is the problem. It took several school shootings for this issue to even bubble to the surface. And our President still doesn’t believe it. In comparison to other countries, the U.S. is quite archaic in its gun control policies. In Australia for example, only 14 percent of homicides are committed by firearms, compared to 60 percent in the U.S. The U.S. gun ownership rate is more than five times the Australian rate. The statistics don’t lie. It is astounding that we aren’t already scrambling to revise our policies. 
Let’s reframe the way we have this debate. As Ciamacca wrote in TIME, “Let’s not talk about school shootings in terms of gun control and mental health. Let’s talk about school safety.” She’s right. There’s no time to wait for stricter gun control policies or a reasonable President. The best course of action for students, parents, and teachers is one of prevention. We need metal detectors, panic buttons, security cameras, and doors and windows that can be secured in the case of a school shooter. We need trained police officers who can protect students while they learn and teachers while they educate. We don’t need more guns.

It’s that time of the year: midterm after midterm, essay after essay, project after project. Even though spring break is days away, it feels like it will never arrive. We’re drained, but assignments aren’t going to finish themselves. How do we stop from burning out?
Let me first explain what burning out is. It’s that week in the semester when you feel so overwhelmed that all you want to do is stay in bed and eat ice cream while watching Netflix. For me, it’s that time when I’m in bed, eating ice cream, and watching bad reality television, when I briefly wonder whether college is worth it. Don’t worry: I always circle around back.
There are many factors that contribute to burning out. First, the most obvious, is the pile of work that’s dumped on us from all our classes. In the beginning of the semester, I heard from professors that they “understand you’re busy with all your classes,” but they still went ahead and scheduled everything the week before mid-semester. While I understand the wish to get exams in before spring break, it feels like I’m falling down a constant chute that never ends.
Another factor is the search for and planning of summer excursions. While this is more concentrated among upperclassmen looking for internships, underclassmen also experience this. For me, as I search for an internship for the summer, it’s hard not to compare myself to my friends who locked down an internship in the fall with Google and Microsoft or some other industry giant.
This speaks to an overarching factor that also contributed to burning out: stress. Our age bracket — 18 to 29 — experiences stress the most often, with 87 percent of the group responding they are sometimes or often stressed.
In recent years, “stress culture” has been highlighted as an issue at universities, especially at Carnegie Mellon. A 2013 study by the Carnegie Mellon Community Think Tank analyzed the different scenarios different students face. The study gives several recommendations of where students can ask for help: Academic Development, Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS), and the Global Communication Center. However, many students don’t want to ask for help, or feel that they have to fight through everything on their own. Everyone seems to be stressed out, sleep deprived, and carrying on like a zombie, that sometimes when I’m not, I feel bad. How ironic: feeling bad about not feeling bad.
The most detrimental part of stress culture is this inherent need for students to want to one-up each other by how much they’re struggling. Among my friends and just around campus, I’ve heard things like, “I had four hours of sleep!” followed by, “Well, I got three!” Or perhaps, “I have three midterms and a group project in two days!” and its response: “I have five midterms and three group projects!”
I can’t say I’m innocent in this. I’ve done it. We feel good about ourselves if we’re suffering more. And when we do prevail and get the work done (which we do, but maybe on no sleep whatsoever), we feel even better.
All these things add up to burning out. Let’s return to the main question: How do we stop from burning out? Or how do we overcome burning out?
There’s no one set path, but the most important thing that has helped me is to make time for yourself. Yes, you have to get things done, but you can’t get those things done if your brain isn’t rested or relaxed. Have a cheat day — not just for food, but for everything. Go shopping (or window shopping). Stay in bed as long as you can. See a movie, binge that television show you’ve been meaning to watch. If you can’t spare a whole day, do something small. Grab a meal at a place you’ve been meaning to try. Buy a pint of Ben & Jerry’s. Limit yourself and only watch one or two episodes of that television show. Essentially, go treat yourself. Taking your mind off all the work will do some good.
Know when to say no. This is especially important if you’re part of a club or organization. Know your schedule so you know if you can take certain responsibilities any given day or week. For me, I’m an editor for The Tartan, but I also enjoy writing articles, like this one, for other sections across the paper. But some weeks, when editors ask if I can write an article, I need to know my schedule that week so I know if I can say yes. Sometimes I can’t, and I need to say no. It has come back to bite me when I don’t say no.
And finally, don’t be afraid to ask for help. Professors do schedule things all around the same time, but they do understand that you’re busy and overwhelmed. Check a week or two ahead to be sure of deadlines, and ask your professor for an extension if you know you can’t physically do all the work as assigned. Unfortunately, this doesn’t help with midterm exams, but it underlines something I’ve been repeating: know your schedule. It will save your life.
Burning out is part of being a student. It’s universal, but it’s also something we should try our best to avoid. Good luck — there’s one more week to go!
