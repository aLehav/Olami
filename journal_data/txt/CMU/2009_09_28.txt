The Carnegie Mellon football team is back in the winners’ circle as they defeated Hiram College with an overpowering 42–3 victory last Saturday. The game took place in Hiram, Ohio, but that did not stop the Tartans from beating the Terriers for the seventh time in a row. With the win, the Tartans’ record moves to 3–1, while Hiram’s drops to 0–3.
First-year Jake Nardone in particular had a breakthrough performance, scoring his first collegiate touchdown and rushing for a career-high 97 yards. The Tartans opened up the scoring with 7:12 to play in the second quarter when senior quarterback Phil Pantalone hit sophomore running back Chris Garcia with a 26-yard pass, who then broke two tackles en route to diving into the end zone for a 7–0 Tartans lead.
The Tartans scored their second goal 1:44 later when junior running back Justin Pratt scored on a 5-yard run, bringing the score to 14–0 two plays after junior Tom Todd blocked a Hiram punt at the 12-yard line. Carnegie Mellon scored once more in the quarter when Nardone ended a 44-yard drive with a 1-yard touchdown run, giving the Tartans a commanding 21–0 lead going into halftime.
Pratt scored another touchdown on a 12-yard run with 18 seconds remaining in the third quarter to cap a 67-yard drive. The Tartans then raised the score to 35–0, when first-year Dave Birsen made an 11-yard run to the end zone. With 5:48 remaining in the game, the Terriers finally broke the Tartans’ shutout with a 22-yard field goal. The momentum was short-lived, though, as Birsen scored another touchdown five minutes later to cap the scoring at 42–3.
“Beating Hiram was a great way to get back on track after a tough loss last week against Hobart,” senior captain Brendan Howe said. “Our offense moved the ball very well and our defense did a great job holding them to only three points. It’s obvious we’ve been getting better every week and we look to continue our success next week at Kenyon.”
The Tartans will look to carry this momentum into their next game at Kenyon College next Saturday. Kickoff is set for 1 p.m.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team recorded their sixth and seventh consecutive wins this week after shutting out both St. Vincent College (6–0) and Grove City College (5–0). In the span of two games, the team scored a whopping 11 goals against their opponents and allowed none in goal. The wins put the Tartans at 8–1 for the season and will most likely push them down in the NSCAA/Adidas Division III rankings in the upcoming week. The team is currently ranked number 12.
Perhaps the most incredible feat of the week came from senior forward Ricky Griffin, who scored a record of five goals in one game against St. Vincent last Wednesday afternoon.The goalfest began in the 20th minute of the match, when Griffin received a pass in front of the goal from fellow senior Keith Hasselhoff and easily put a shot past the keeper to put the Tartans up 1–0. Six minutes later, Griffin used his speed on a breakaway to bury the ball in the left corner of the goal.
In the second half, Griffin came out hungry for more as he scored three more goals within the first eight minutes of the half. His third goal of the day, and second unassisted, was scored off a 15-yard blast into the upper right corner. Shortly thereafter, Griffin took an assist from senior Ryan Browne to score his fourth of the day. Three and a half minutes later, Griffin netted perhaps his most brilliant goal of the day as he scored off a beautiful diving header. Sophomore Kyle Young topped off the scoring in the 76th minute, making his first goal of his collegiate career.
The onslaught continued on Saturday as the Tartans downed Grove City College in a rain-soaked home fixture. The team maintained possession throughout the vast majority of the first half, but initially had trouble getting on the score sheet. Sophomore Brad Edelman looked dangerous early on as he continuously put pressure on the Grove City back line, but was unable to take advantage of a few opportunities. 
The team was also hampered by two offside calls before finally scoring in the 36th minute on yet another goal by Griffin. The weather conditions worsened after the half as the rain and wind picked up, but the Tartans played on unaffected. The goals came easy for seniors Pat Lutz, Ryan Heuler, and Griffin, as each scored in the second half within a 10-minute period to put the Tartans up 4–0. Senior Jon Hall then joined the parade with his first goal of the season to seal the 5–0 victory. Senior goalie Maks Khurgin continued his excellent play as he posted his sixth shutout of the year.
The Tartans’ next match will be at home against the Bison of Bethany College this Tuesday, Sept. 29 at 7:30 p.m.

The Carnegie Mellon women's soccer team reversed their recent bad fortunes with two victories this past week. The team first pulled out a 1–0 nail-biter over Allegheny College on Wednesday before asserting themselves in a 2–0 win over John Carroll University on Saturday. The victories improved the Tartans' record to 3–4 on the season and gives the team some momentum following a three-game losing streak.
The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team reversed their recent bad fortunes with two victories this past week. The team first pulled out a 1–0 nail-biter over Allegheny College on Wednesday before asserting themselves in a 2–0 win over John Carroll University on Saturday. The victories improved the Tartans’ record to 3–4 on the season and give the team some momentum following a three-game losing streak.
The victory over Allegheny was not just the end of Carnegie Mellon’s losing streak; the 1–0 victory in regulation also broke a streak of four straight overtime matches between the two teams. The game’s only goal came when sophomore Nicole Bayley broke through the Gators’ defense in the 59th minute, taking a pass from junior Alice Mayfield and depositing it into the lower left corner of the goal. The goal was Bayley’s first of the season. Allegheny’s only threat came in the 38th minute of a scoreless first half, when Gator Abby Silvester’s shot was saved by Tartans junior keeper Anya Rosen. The Tartans’ defense shined, making sure that Silvester’s kick was Allegheny’s only shot on goal all game. Rosen was huge for the Tartans, playing a steadfast, scoreless game to allow for Bayley’s goal to stand up for the victory.
On Saturday, Rosen earned another shutout win as the Tartans’ defense shined once more, this time allowing John Carroll no shots on goal. In the first period, junior Emily Overstreet and sophomore Elsa Wu each took shots that were blocked by the Blue Streaks’ defense while senior Casey Garth’s shot in the sixth minute was saved by John Carroll keeper Molly Gradowski. 
The Tartans finally broke the ice at the start of the second half. In the 48th minute, Bayley and first-year Lissie Arndt assisted junior Alice Mayfield’s first goal of the season in a scramble in the box to put Carnegie Mellon up 1–0. First-year Katie Davis later added her second goal of the season, heading in Overstreet’s corner kick, to seal the 2–0 victory.
“This is definitely a momentum builder,” said Bayley after Saturday’s victory. “It shows a lot of character to bounce back from a three-game losing streak and we’re excited to start conference play [on Oct. 3]. Two wins are great, but we have to focus on our next game now and we can’t rest on what we’ve done in the past.”
The Tartans will next hit the field against Grove City on Tuesday at 4:30 p.m.

For most athletes, sports like cross country seem more like punishment than fun, but the Tartans prove that success can be found in these grueling races. J.P. Allera is an example of this success, having recently been named University Athletic Association (UAA) Men’s Cross Country Athlete of the Week. As a junior at Carnegie Mellon, Allera looks to be harnessing what he calls Pittsburgh’s “active atmosphere” in his efforts, consistently appearing in the top 10 at the finish line. Allera is a native of Columbia, Md., and while he enjoys the city scenery for college, his hometown is not so limited when it comes to strategic running routes.
Allera, majoring in chemistry and chemical engineering, said his most memorable class is organic chemistry. He credits his professor, Bruce Armitage, for maintaining the students’ interest during the early 8:30 a.m. hour. Allera decided to complete his second major in chemistry because he enjoys the science and engineering facets of the subject. When he’s not studying or running through the woods of a cross country course, Allera maintains musical interests by playing the saxophone and teaching himself the harmonica.
Allera played soccer growing up before reaching high school, but he was really inspired to pursue cross country by his pastor, who also happened to be his high school coach. A past cross country great himself, Allera’s coach was a mentor and a factor in Allera’s present achievements. Allera hopes that his personal and team goals, such as reaching the top four at the conference meet, can be attained this season. He keeps a positive disposition, saying “I never go into a race with the mindset that someone is going to beat me, so when I toe the line, I concede nothing to anybody.” With an attitude like that, it’s no wonder that Allera has been able to perform at top level, and he will be able to continue to persevere to make sure his goals are met.

Gluttony will collide with athleticism this weekend at Carnegie Mellon’s most ironic sporting event. The CMU Donut Dash, a fundraiser for the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, is a combination competitive eating contest and two-mile run that will be held at 10 a.m. on Saturday behind Hunt Library. The brothers of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, the organizers of Donut Dash, are hopeful that this strange hybrid of endurance and appetite will help them raise their goal of $5000.
The rules of the race are simple to understand but potentially nauseating. Competitors will be asked to run a mile from the library around campus to the UC turnaround. Krispy Kreme donuts will be distributed at the turnaround for participants to quickly eat before finishing a grueling second mile down to Schenley Drive and back up Frew Street to the finish.
The event’s website specifically addresses what many may consider the inevitable: “We can’t technically stop you from throwing up, but please don’t make yourself throw up.”
There are three ways for potential athletes to participate in the CMU Donut Dash: a competitor can either run in the Individual Challenge, in the Team Challenge as a group of three, or in the Casual Division. As an individual challenger, each person must eat a full dozen donuts, while in the team competition the 12 are spread out among the three competitors. Casual runners are welcome to eat as much or as little as they’d like, but they are not eligible to win. Each participant will receive a free T-shirt to commemorate the event.
As of writing this article, there are already about 70 participants stretching their quads and readying their elastic waistbands in anticipation of Saturday morning. Holly Hippensteel, Carnegie Mellon’s director of student life, will be on hand to eat the “opening donut.” After the races conclude, the brothers of SAE will have music, awards, and festivities for all participants.
The Greek community is expected to have a strong showing. “I’m not going to ask someone to do something I wouldn’t do myself,” said Paul Jasinto, assistant philanthropy chairman for Sigma Alpha Epsilon. “I’m going to run with them, eat with them, and take that last miserable mile to the finish line.”
In preparation for the Donut Dash, there will be a training session Wednesday from noon to 3 p.m. outside of Doherty Hall. Donuts will be given in return for donations and brave students can try their hand at quickly eating a donut and completing a short sprint.
To sign up to run or help out for this event, students can visit the CMU Donut Dash website, cmudonutdash.com. 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon has already raised over $3600 for the Children’s Hospital and will accept donations and registrations until the day of the event.

Six seems to be the number for the Carnegie Mellon men’s golf team, which finished sixth at the Guy W. Kuhn Invitational hosted at The Country Club of Meadville by Allegheny College, following their prior sixth place finish at the Lamkin Fall International.
The Tartans were led by sophomore Terrance Einhorn, who carded a two-day total of 149 (73–76) and placed sixth individually. As a team, the Tartans scored a 310 on Sunday followed by a 311 on Monday to finish the Invitational with a combined 621.
Division II California University of Pennsylvania led the 18-team field both days, finishing the 36-hole event just 26 strokes over par with a 602. Taking second place and ending seven strokes back from the leader was fellow Division II school Clarion University. Daemen College finished third (610), followed by University of Rochester (615) in fourth, and St. Vincent (619) placed fifth.
Jared Schmader of Clarion was the individual leader, completing the two-day event even par with a 144 (71–73). Steve Fiori of St. Vincent, Zack Oyer of Muhlenberg, and Austin Stoddard of California University of Pennsylvania all finished tied for second, shooting just three over par.
Sophomore Michael Cheng helped the Tartans to their sixth place finish with a 141, shooting a 73 on Sunday and a 78 on Monday, finishing tied for 13th overall. 
Seniors Christopher Lee and Brett Cannaday came in third and fourth for the Tartans, carding a 160 (83–77) and 162 (82–80), respectively. First-year Charles Windon finished with a 167 (82–85) to round out the field for the Tartans.
While Einhorn has been the leading golfer for the Tartans this year, he is not completely satisfied. “This past weekend, I really was in a great position to win the tournament but made a couple of uncharacteristic mental errors coming down the stretch, which cost me the tournament,” Einhorn said. “So, while I’m happy with my game, I really want to try to keep it all together next week and get an even better result.”
The Tartans will hit the links again Oct. 4–5 at the California (Pa.) Vulcan Invitational to be held at Cedarbrook Golf Course in Belle Vernon, Pa.

Last Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon volleyball team traveled to Alliance, Ohio to compete against Mount Union College but were unable to overcome the Purple Raiders’ tough defenses and dropped a 3–1 decision. The Purple Raiders move to 12–2 for the season while the Tartans shift to 9–5.
The Tartans started off strong, decisively taking the first game 25–13. The momentum began to change after the second game, where the Tartans narrowly lost 25–22. The Purple Raiders pulled ahead and took the second game 25–21 and held their defenses tight to prevent the Tartans from taking the fourth game, winning it 25–18.
Defensively, Junior Cameron Griffin led the team with total digs, taking 24 for the match. Following Griffin’s example were sophomore Emily Baddock with 10 kills and senior Cara Fatigati with eight kills.
On the offense side, seniors Jess Brackin, Megan Killeen, and Sam Carter led the Tartans and each contributed eight kills. Junior Caroline Size added seven kills. Carter also had 34 assists against the Purple Raiders.
The Tartans hit the court Wednesday, when they travel to Beaver Falls, Pa. to play Geneva College.

It has a video camera, a radio, a pedometer, and when you shake it, a new song plays. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the new iPod nano has arrived, complete with a larger screen, video capturing capabilities, and a sweet polished anodized aluminum finish in nine colors. Did I mention that it has a built-in microphone and speaker? This new nano has some things we’ve never seen on an iPod before — or at least I haven’t seen; I was still boppin’ along to the nano from 2005.
Along with the new finish and bigger screen, the most noticeable physical change is the addition of a video camera on the back of the iPod. Owners can now capture live footage of protesters at the Fence or friends snoring in class, in portrait or landscape mode. With the bigger 2.2-inch screen, you can also choose from 15 video effects to jazz up your home videos, such as sepia, black and white, and kaleidoscope, according to the advertisements. I have been unsuccessful in trying to find these cool features, but I’m sure I’ll come across them. With the click of a mouse, the videos are on a laptop, posted on Facebook, and now everyone can watch somebody’s roommate solve a Rubix cube in eight seconds. Now, I know the iPod advertisements boast of high-quality images, but they’re not lying. The video and audio qualities are both remarkable considering the size of the device.
The speakers are good for your music too; just unplug your headphones and you can let your friends listen to the new CD you purchased and put on your iPod. If they liked the sound of that band, you can use the click wheel to create a Genius playlist. Just like in iTunes, the iPod nano will create a new playlist with similar songs, and you have the option of saving the playlist if you like what you hear. The only thing about this feature on the iPod, just like on iTunes, is that you only get a good Genius mix if you have a lot of music that fits the right profile. If you only have a few similar songs on your iPod, don’t expect an amazing Genius playlist. Go purchase more music instead.
In case you get tired of listening to your own music, just turn on your iPod’s FM radio. Compatible stations will scroll the name of the song and artist, and along with this new radio comes Live Pause and iTunes tagging, designed to enhance the listening experience. Live Pause enables listeners on their way to class to pause their favorite station and talk to someone, then resume listening to their station again. 
The technology even allows rewinding as far back as 15 minutes and fast forwarding to catch up with the live station. It’s pretty nifty. iTunes tagging is for every person who’s ever heard a song on the radio and wanted to download it, but couldn’t remember the name of it. Users can simply use the click wheel to tag the songs they hear on the radio that they like, and the iPod makes a list of the tagged songs. 
When you connect the iPod to your computer, the tagged list is in iTunes and you can purchase the songs. Unfortunately for international students, so far this technology only works in the United States.
So there’s video, there’s radio; what else is so amazing about this thing? The pedometer, because everyone has always wanted one of those. No, really, for the motivated people who keep up a fitness plan, or for anyone who’s just curious, the new pedometer feature offers a daily step goal or the option to continually count steps all the time. It can also keep track of how many calories you burn a day.
And while listening to your iPod on your bike or on your run, as the pedometer counts your calories and steps, the new Voice Over technology seamlessly tells you which song is playing. This technology is already popular on the iPod shuffle, but maybe hearing it on the nano is different because it sounds rather computerized. 
I feel like it’s rather unnecessary, but I guess if you really have so much music that you’ve forgotten the name of the song you’re listening to, and your hands are occupied with whatever, it could be nice.
Most users would agree that there are certain new features that trump the Voice Over. “I think the best thing they put on the new nano was the video camera and the built-in mic and speakers,” said Cole Vandross, a first-year mechanical engineering major. Others agree that the new nano is supreme. 
“The 2.2-inch screen and 240-by-376 resolution really maximizes the look of the videos and the cover art flow,” said James Williams, a sophomore computer science major. 
“It makes me feel like my old new iPod is obsolete now; I have to get this new one.” Apple did more than just add new shiny features to the nano, and Vandross noticed this. “I also appreciate Apple’s efforts in being a part of the green movement with the mercury-free LED-backlit display and the recyclable aluminum case.” So when I am on my way to class, the sounds of the traffic on Fifth Avenue can’t compete with the environmentally friendly iPod nano, counting my steps all the way to Wean Hall.

The DeLorean from Back to the Future set the standard for cars of the future — cars of 2015, according to the movie. In 1985, when the movie was released, most cars still resorted to using wheels driven by piston engines. Around the same time, a less famous engine was only being perfected and was assumed to be the real future of cars. The Wankel engine was this little-known engine that promised so much.
The Wankel engine is a type of rotary engine. Rotary engines have been in existence since World War I and have been used in some aircraft, motorcycles, and automobiles ever since. The Wankel engine was invented by Felix Wankel, an engineer at NSU Motorenwerke AG. In 1964, NSU unveiled their first car to use this engine, the NSU Spider. Time magazine explained that it took NSU 10 years of engineering before this new engine could be commercially produced with satisfactory results. This new engine, weighing about half as much as a conventional piston engine of the same capacity, seemed promising at the time. High-profile companies such as Curtiss-Wright Corp., Outboard Marine Corp., and Rolls-Royce paid NSU licenses for the Wankel engine, as it was the belief at the time that Wankel engines would replace piston engines.
Over the years, the Wankel engine has been put to a number of uses that include airplane, motorcycle, and race car engines. However, very few automobile companies have adopted this engine. The Japanese automobile manufacturer Mazda Motor Corp. is notably the biggest user of Wankel engines in their vehicles. The Wankel engine produces energy by turning a rotor within a housing. The rotor is triangular, with convex sides and pockets on the three faces. These pockets hold the fuel and provide the chamber for fuel ignition. The housing is roughly oval in shape, resembling a figure eight with a broader mid-section (this figure is called an epitrochoid).
Within the housing, the rotor spins about a central gear and output shaft. The fuel inlet and exhaust outlet ports, along with the spark plugs, are on the walls of the housing. These ports do not require valves as in standard piston engines, and are directly connected to the throttle and exhaust, respectively. This helps reduce the complexity of the engine by decreasing the number of parts involved. 
The rotary engine conserves some of the energy that otherwise would have been lost in changing the direction of motion of the pistons by using the energy to turn the rotor. In internal combustion engines, pistons — or the rotor as in the case of the rotary engine — are driven by fuel ignition. In the case of reciprocating engines, these pistons are allowed only a single degree of freedom. The pistons have to move up along an axis before changing their direction of motion and moving down along the same axis. In the rotary engine, the rotor is again allowed only one degree of freedom: rotatory. This allows the rotor to be driven continuously along the same direction. As the rotor spins, the engine sees the same four strokes a conventional piston engine does. The fuel enters the housing through the inlet port in the inlet stroke before the rotor compresses the fuel in the second stroke. The spark plugs ignite the fuel in the third stroke, causing a rapid expansion of gases, which turns the rotor further and pushes the waste gases to the exhaust port in the fourth stroke.
The Wankel engine is also composed of fewer and less complex parts than in piston engines. This has allowed for extremely small such engines to be built. In 2001, Carlos Fernandez-Pello, from the University of California at Berkeley, successfully tested a Wankel engine the size of a penny. The idea behind micro-sized engines is that they produce more power than contemporary power cells for the same size. They can also be refueled instead of discarded, reducing costs associated with waste and disposal. While the Wankel engine has an innovative design and a satisfactorily high power-to-weight ratio for an engine, it has not seen widespread use, and this is primarily due to the comparatively high emissions. The shape of the rotor introduces a number of problems involving the seals of the rotor and housing. This engine also uses more fuel than a piston engine, rendering it an expensive proposition for a mainstream car. In races and for propeller airplanes, this engine is particularly advantageous due to its light weight.
The Wankel engine today sees more applications in fields other than the automobile industry for which it was initially intended. Apart from its use in races and aircraft, this engine is used in a number of recreational applications, such as model planes and go-karts. The engine is still far from perfect and cannot compete with the piston engines of today. However, with sufficient research on the Wankel engine, it is not hard to envision a 2015 with at least a few DeLoreans.

Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is the name given to a group of inherited genetic diseases characterized by the loss of motor neurons, which are the nerve cells that transmit impulses from the brain or spinal cord to muscle tissue. 
This inability of the brain and muscle tissue to communicate with each other results in severe muscle weakness and atrophy in the muscles closest to the trunk of the body, which are the muscles necessary for crawling, walking, sitting up, and head control, though other muscles can be affected as well.
SMA is an autosomal recessive genetic disease, which means that for a child to have SMA, both parents must be carriers of the abnormal SMA gene, and both must pass this gene on to their child. This makes the chance of a child inheriting the disease from two patients who are carriers one in four, or 25 percent. The gene that is affected is survival motor neuron 1, or SMN1. This gene produces the survival motor neuron protein, and a deficiency of this protein can have a severe effect on motor neurons. Without the protein, the motor neurons can atrophy, shrink, and eventually die. One in every 40 people, or 7.5 million Americans,  is a carrier of the gene that causes SMA,  which leads to one in every 6000 children being born with SMA.
SMA is broken up into different types, or categories, depending on the age of onset and the disease’s severity. Type I SMA, called Werdnig-Hoffmann Disease, is the most severe of the different types, and the diagnosis of children with this type is usually made before 6 months of age. 
Patients with this form are generally unable to sit unsupported, have trouble eating and swallowing, and have underdeveloped lungs and a weak cough. Type II is usually diagnosed in patients less than 2 years of age and is less severe than Type I. Patients can often sit unsupported, and can get into a standing position with some sort of assistive device. Scoliosis, or the curving of the spine, is very common in Type II patients, as are weak lungs like patients with Type I. Type III SMA is also known as Kugelberg-Welander or Juvenile Spinal Muscular Atrophy and has a much greater range in time of onset. 
Patients with Type III can stand on their own and walk, though they may have difficulty walking at some point in their life, usually associated with a growth spurt or illness. These patients often have difficulty walking, and will fall more than normal and have a more difficult time righting themselves. 
The last form of SMA, Type IV, is the adult onset form of the disease, and is much rarer than the other types, and has a much slower progression.
In all forms of SMA, patients generally lose function over time, though many patients see a plateau in performance for long periods of time.
Research done in the last few years concerning SMA has led to a great increase in knowledge and understanding about how the disease works. Not only was the SMN1 gene identified as the cause of SMA, and its production of the SMN protein found to affect the motor neurons, but another gene was also found: SMN2. 
This gene is believed to be a partially functioning backup gene that makes about 10 percent as much of the SMN protein as a healthy SMN1 gene would produce. The current research is focusing on drugs and treatments that could help enhance SMN2’s production of the SMN protein in order to bring them up to healthy SMN1 levels.

AIDS vaccine shows promising results
According to a study conducted in Thailand, a new vaccine for HIV has been shown to reduce the risk of being infected by the virus by 31 percent. 
The study was conducted on more than 16,000 volunteers and has shown the best results out of such tests conducted so far. The vaccine administered was a combination of two vaccines, each of which has a different method of agency.Each vaccine was not very effective when administered individually, but the combination of the two proved to be good at preventing infection. Researchers do not think that the vaccine can be released just yet, but are starting to plan ways to improve the vaccine so that its effectiveness can be increased.

Early antiviral use helps with swine flu
The World Health Organization believes that administering antivirals to patients displaying symptoms of swine flu early on will help cure the patients and prevent the disease from becoming more severe. 
Statistics from across the world have shown that treatment of patients with drugs like oseltamivir and zanamivir right after the onset of symptoms prevents the development of further complications from the disease. The WHO recommended that people should not take the antivirals as a preventive measure before they have symptoms of the disease, as this could exacerbate the development of a drug-resistant form of the virus.

MRSA infections spread to pets
The drug-resistant Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) bacterium has typically been common in humans, especially in those who have been hospitalized for a long time. However, recently the germ has started infecting animals including dogs, cats, and rabbits. Researchers now believe that it is easy for animal caretakers to contract MRSA. 
Researchers believe that the germ may have been initially transmitted to these animals from humans. 
As a preventive measure, doctors recommend pet owners wash their hands before and after playing with the pets and not allow the pets to lick their faces.

Alcohol may help with brain injury
According to a study published in the Archives of Surgery, alcohol may help patients recover from traumatic brain injuries. 
Out of the patients studied, 38 percent had alcohol in their bloodstreams, and these patients had a lower risk of dying than those who did not have any alcohol in their blood.
Since alcohol consumption is the major cause for many accidents leading to brain trauma, researchers do not believe that drinking is good for the patients, but believe that this new discovery could lead to the development of better treatments.

Research deciphers images in brain
Scientists have come up with  a new method to model images based on neural activity from the subjects. In the future, this technique could possibly lead to the development of devices like dream readers or thought-controlled computers.
In the study, published in the journal Neuron, researchers collected fMRI data, which measures blood flow in the brain, from three subjects as they looked at pictures of ordinary objects and scenes. Later, after coming up with a model based on this data, the subjects looked at another set of pictures, and by analyzing the neural output, the researchers were able to pick the corresponding pictures from a set of around 6 million images.

Data shows water on moon
Data from three different spacecraft show that there may be water on the moon. The most recent space mission to show that the moon contains water was India’s Chandrayaan-1 mission. Chandrayaan-1 collected data of the sunlight reflected from the surface of the moon and found that light was absorbed at the wavelength at which water normally absorbs infrared light.
Data was also analyzed from NASA’s Cassini spacecraft, which passed the moon nearly a decade ago, and from the Deep Impact spacecraft. Analysis of data from the Cassini spacecraft indicates the presence of hydroxyl molecules mostly at the poles on the moon. Data from the Deep Impact spacecraft also indicates that the absorption of light changes with differences in temperature.

MIT develops eye implant
Researchers working at the  Massachusetts Institute of  Technology have developed an eye implant that could help restore vision to the blind. As of now, the implant has been designed for patients suffering from retinitis pigmentosa or age-related macular degeneration. 
The prosthetic device makes up for a damaged retina by electrically stimulating the nerve cells that normally carry the visual stimulus from the retina to the brain.
Although such a device cannot completely restore vision to the visually impaired, it can help them perform daily tasks, such as navigating through a room, far more easily.

New find strengthens dinosaur-bird link
Chinese scientists have found new evidence that agrees with the hypothesis that birds descended from dinosaurs. The researchers have found a very well-preserved fossil of a dinosaur species known as Anchiornis huxleyi. The fossil shows that the species had four wings and also had feathers.
This finding indicates that that the Anchiornis huxleyi could be the missing link between dinosaurs and birds. Anchiornis huxleyi was present even before the Archaeopteryx, which is considered to be the earliest bird. Since bird-like features were found in the Anchiornis huxleyi, it indicates that features resembling birds were present in the early dinosaurs as  well.

“Bem Vindo a Sao Paulo” read the nine-foot sign at the baggage claim. Twelve hours, two planes, a 30-minute train ride, and a three-hour long drive later, I had finally reached my destination: the immense city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. 
I rushed out of baggage claim only to find that the study abroad program coordinators had left the airport, as I had arrived after the scheduled pick up time. Immediately, Thiago, my new Brazilian friend from the plane, offered to take me to my final destination. 
There I was, on my way to the hotel with Thiago’s mother, father, sister, and niece. They greeted me as if they had known me their whole lives, took me to lunch, and dropped me off at my hotel, and Thiago’s mother went in with me to ensure that nothing was out of order with my reservation. 
They gave me all their contact information and insisted that I call them if I needed anything. That was my first glimpse of the welcoming, cheerful nature of Brazilian culture.
Generally, a person’s physical appearance can provide some insight into what their ethnic background may be. For Brazilians, this does not apply. Brazil is a melting pot of cultures, ethnicities, and languages. 
Brazilians are Brazilians, whether they are from Rio Grande do Sul with Germanic and Polish roots, from Salvador da Bahia with a distinct African heritage, or from an Indian tribal village in the central-west region of the country. 
Brazil also houses the largest Japanese population in the world — after Japan, of course. Each region has its own culture; music and colloquial language are very much influenced by their ethnic roots and many times differ drastically from one another. Brazilian music captures the nature of this diversity very clearly. 
The smooth, jazz-like sounds of bossa nova, the pop-like songs of Música Popular Brasileira (MBP), the very inappropriate lyrics of baile funky, the country-like songs of sertanejo, and, my personal favorite, the samba with its lively African beats, all contribute to the mosaic diversity that characterizes Brazilian music.
With regard to my educational experience, I would not change a thing — besides my morning class at 7 a.m., that is. I study at a university called Fundacao Getulio Vargas (FGV), and our classes are quite rigorous with the standard of education on par with that of Carnegie Mellon. Much of the work is group based — which can be a setback considering the very relaxed attitudes of many Brazilian students. 
Brazilians are great hosts; hence, a group meeting for a project easily turns into a few beers, great food, and a good selection of Brazilian music. Besides school, I also work as a research analyst for the Center of Finance and Private Equity at my university, which is an experience I value very much considering FGV is a highly regarded business school in Latin America. I enjoy my academic curriculum here and absolutely love my job; I feel like I am learning so much so quickly.
I have enjoyed Sao Paulo very much. It’s an immense city with so much to do — including an incredible night life — and I have made an amazing group of friends with whom I share it all. However, my heart belongs to the city of Rio de Janeiro. In all my life, I have never experienced something as incredible as the first weekend I spent in Rio. I’m almost hesitant to put my experience in writing because I don’t think my writing will do the city justice. 
We arrived at Rio on a Thursday night, and as we were driving into the city, the first visible sight was the image of the famous Cristo Rendedor, a 100-foot high statue of Jesus Christ (pictured below). The Christ stands almost mystically on the very tip of the mountain, and clouds surround its base, giving the appearance of its being suspended in the air.
The first thing that came to mind was disbelief that I was actually here. The lively, fiesta-like, very laid back culture of cariocas is uplifting — it makes me smile. The world-famous beaches of Ipanema and Copacabana are a sight to see. 
The views from different parts of the city are incredible. There’s samba in the streets of Lapa, where much of the nightlife happens, every night until 6 in the morning. 
My friends and I walked into a bar where a group of musicians were playing at a single table with hundreds of people surrounding them, dancing to their hearts’ content. We danced along with them, with absolutely no idea how to properly execute their signature dance moves, but I think we did a fairly good job — if I do say so myself. 
With my broken Portuguese and mediocre samba skills, I am immersing myself fully in the Brazilian culture and loving every minute of it. I would say to any student considering studying abroad that it’s important you do. It is part of your education, because what you learn about the world, the nature of people, and most importantly yourself is invaluable.

As much as I love foie gras, oyster, and vin blanc (white wine), it is the simple dish of fried eggs that I always crave. I fell in love with fried egg in high school; sure, I made spaghetti alfredo for my school lunch box, but kai jeaw, fried egg made Thai style, was my dinner.
Kai jeaw is a simple staple dish of Thailand — something like the peanut butter and jelly sandwich of America. This golden dish is something your mom makes when you complain of hunger at midnight. But you don’t need to trouble your mother every time you crave it; you can buy a freshly fried omelet over rice for 20 baht (approximately $0.50) on the streets of Thailand.
Kai jeaw, simply put, is a deep fried omelet, and although it sounds easy to make, it is a dish that requires attention and involvement.
Here’s my take on how to cook up light and airy, luminous gold, nutty tang, it’s-so-oily-don’t-tell-my-mom kai jeaw.
Ingredients: Egg(s). One or two, depending on preference. Rice. Try pairing the dish with jasmine rice as well. One cup of oil. Peanut oil or olive oil is recommended if you can indulge in some. Wedge of lemon or lime. 
Optional but highly recommended: Prik Nampra, a delicious Thai chilies and fish sauce and Thai chicken chili sauce.
Thai street vendors use a black wok on a blazing Asian stove to cook up some kai jeaw, but here in America, we must make do with a saucepan. I like my kai jeaw light and fluffy, and to do this you need cookware that is comparatively deep. Depending on your cookware, make sure the depth of oil in it is approximately an inch, and slowly heat the oil to a medium to high temperature.
Crack an egg in a separate bowl — there’s a reason this instruction comes after you start to heat the oil — and while waiting for the oil to heat up, beat the egg with fork for a minute and add in a few drops of lemon juice.
To check if the oil is hot enough, drizzle a little bit of egg into the saucepan; the egg should fluff up immediately. If the egg takes a couple of seconds to bubble, the oil is not hot enough; make sure there’s no smoke either.
Once the oil is hot enough, pour the egg into the saucepan. Start pouring the egg near the oil, and as you continue to pour, slowly lift the bowl higher so that the egg gets fluffier. Even when cooking with just a single egg, I fry them in two batches, ensuring enough room for the egg to expand to its full potential.
At this point, lower the heat to medium — you want to make sure you don’t burn the egg. Flip it once the top catches a golden touch and repeat so that the other side does too. Then serve the golden, fluffy kai jeaw on hot rice.
Some people like eating their egg with ground pork, sliced onion, or basil leaves. You can add these ingredients to your recipe as well, but remember that the more additions you make, the less fluffy and more meaty your kai jeaw gets. Experiment with both and then take your pick.
You can also add some sticky sweet Thai chili sauce, bottles of which are often seen at the white trucks serving Thai food on Margaret Morrison Street. It adds flavor and spice to the dish, so go ahead and give it a try.
I enjoy my egg golden-brown and eat it with chilies and fish sauce. The sauce is pretty easy to make and can be done in a few simple steps.
Ingredients: A few Asian chilies. Fish sauce. Wedge of lemon. You can use the same wedge used to make the fried egg; only a few more drops of lemon juice are needed. A couple cloves of garlic. In my opinion, much like butter, garlic makes everything tastier.
Cut the chilies crosswise and make them very thin, then put them into a small sauce bowl. Thinly slice the garlic as well — again, the thinner the better — and place them with the chilies. Squeeze a few drops — three to five drops — of lemon juice, and add just enough fish sauce to cover all the ingredients. Let the sauce sit until your meal is ready.
I prefer to make the chili and fish sauce before cooking my meal to give some time for the flavor of all the ingredients to come together. This sauce can be eaten with just about anything. It is a good idea to refrigerate leftover sauce and add more chilies, garlic, or fish sauce when needed. This allows the flavor to develop well.
Just as a warning: this dish, along with anything fried, is not recommended to be cooked during the winter by people who have their own kitchens. Clothes and beds — and the entire apartment, for that matter — will end up smelling like kai jeaw for the entire week.

The School of Drama and Carnegie Mellon’s student-run theater group Scotch’n’Soda offer a menu of performances this fall semester that will appease every theatrical appetite. 
The School of Drama kicks off their theatrical season with The Grapes of Wrath, playing Oct. 1–10, with performances Tuesday through Saturday at 8 p.m. and a matinee performance on Saturday at 2 p.m. Adapted by Frank Galatic from the novel by John Steinbeck, the play follows a family of sharecroppers, the Joads, as they travel across America searching for a better life in the years following the Great Depression. Winner of the Tony Award for Best Play in 1990, The Grapes of Wrath holds particular relevance in today’s economic climate. 
On the other side of the spectrum is a satire of the white-collared corporate world: The musical How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying will open Nov. 12 and run through Nov. 21. With music and lyrics by Frank Loesser and based on the book by Abe Burrows, Jack Weinstock, and Willie Gilber, this musical satire of the business world will be directed by Broadway import Daniel Goldstein. Goldstein comes to Pittsburgh after having worked as associate director for the Broadway musical All Shook Up, a musical revolving around the songs of Elvis Presley. The Broadway production ran from September 2004 through March 2005. How to Succeed premiered in 1961 and ran for four years, picking up seven Tony Awards and a Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The musical was revived in 1995 with leads played by Matthew Broderick and Megan Mullally. 
The Scotch’n’Soda theater group will be putting on a musical adaptation of Charles Dickens’ last, unfinished mystery novel, The Mystery of Edwin Drood, over Halloween weekend (which is also Homecoming weekend). As it is a “participatory production,” the audience is asked to vote for the ending they wish to see performed at the end of each show. Student director and senior music major Scott Wasserman brings British humor and murder mystery to life in a production that features actors from all departments of the university. “Even if musical theater isn’t your ‘thing,’ you’ll love the high energy, humor, and audience participation in Drood,” Wasserman said.
The School of Drama’s Three Days of Rain by Richard Greenberg is a surreal, three-act play that delves into the impact of relationships, with both short-term and lifelong repercussions. This play received widespread (mostly negative) press during its production on Broadway, which starred television and film actors Julia Roberts, Bradley Cooper, and Paul Rudd, who were criticized for not delivering the presence or range in acting necessary for this play to succeed. However, Three Days of Rain, which has since been performed in London’s West End (with the title character played by Atonement’s hunky James McAvoy) is a thought-provoking, fast-paced piece that requires the audience to ask questions of themselves as much as Greenberg asks them of his tormented characters. The play will only be performed for a limited time, Oct. 28–30, and should not be missed.
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned: Medea by Euripides is another short-running play which will be put on Dec. 2–5. The plot revolves around the revenge of a woman who has been betrayed by her husband. Another Greek tragedy, Burial at Thebes, opens on Nov. 11 and runs until Nov. 13. This is Seamus Heaney’s new translation of Sophocles’ Antigone and explains Antigone’s punishment — being walled up inside a cave — after she defies the king of Creon in protecting the dignity of her brother.
Looking forward into the spring semester, the School of Drama has planned the following productions:
The Winter Festival of New Plays, premiering new works by Carnegie Mellon dramatic writing students. Jan. 29–Feb. 27.
Dead Man’s Cell Phone by Sarah Ruhl. Feb. 10–12.
In The Blood by Suzan-Lori Parks. Feb. 16–24.
The Inspector General by Nikolai Gogol (a new adaptation by Michael M. Chemers). Feb. 18–27.
Slow Dance on the Killing Ground by William Hanley. March 17–19.
Richard III by William Shakespeare. April 15–24.
Thérèse Raquin by Neal Bell. April 21–24.
Tickets to School of Drama productions can be purchased at the ticket box in the lobby of the School of Drama's Purnell Center. For availability, please call 412.268.2407. Tickets for Scotch'n'Soda productions can be purchased online at snstheatre.org.

From the first note played by the orchestra to the last emotional chords sung by Onegin and Tatiana, the Pittsburgh Opera’s presentation of Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin last Saturday was a huge success.
Tchaikovsky’s opera, first performed in 1879, is based on Alexander Pushkin’s novel, written in verse, of the same name. Much of the verse sung in the opera is taken directly from the novel, and the entire opera is sung in Russian.
Tatiana (Anna Samuil) and Olga (Lindsay Ammann) are sisters, and are two of the main characters. Olga is in love with their neighbor, Lensky (Raymond Very), who brings a friend and neighbor, Eugene Onegin (Dwayne Croft), to their house to visit. 
Tatiana immediately falls in love with Onegin, only to be rejected by him after sending him a letter. Despite the fact that Onegin and Lensky are friends, they quarrel in the second act and ultimately fight a duel. In the third act, Onegin realizes that he is in love with Tatiana, only to find that she has married his older cousin and is no longer available for him.
All of the cast members were wonderful performers with powerful voices. In each scene, the characters’ emotions showed both through the tone and volume of singing and through physical actions, and each note sung contained meaning and emotion.
When Tatiana is thinking about writing to Onegin, her excitement, anxiety, and worry show through her actions. She often looks at herself in a mirror, and when she sings that she is ashamed, her voice transmits her emotion, and one cannot help but sympathize with her.
This scene was also particularly interesting because it took place in Tatiana’s bedroom. The way that this was portrayed was to have a room seemingly floating above the stage. The space around it was unused, and it was clear that her bedroom was on the second floor of the house, which looked almost like a dollhouse. 
Doors led to balconies and out of the room, and when Tatiana observed that it was morning and she had not slept, sunshine (or what looked very much like it inside of the theater, anyway) crept in through her window and her outside door.
After Tatiana’s old nursemaid, Filipyevna (Susan Shafer), agrees to have someone deliver the letter, the scene changes, and the room disappears to give way to woods and peasant women picking berries. The women sing of how they will pelt men with berries and then leave the stage for Tatiana.
Tatiana is frantic, and the worry and regret over sending the letter show in her singing, her breathing, and her frantic movements around the stage. When Onegin comes into the forest, he pulls the letter out of his coat pocket and not-so-sensitively informs her that it’s no use pretending she didn’t write it.
After Tatiana sits on a bench — her face distraught, her breathing heavier and shakier — Onegin tells her to be more careful next time; other men might be less kind to her about it than he was. Tatiana is crushed, and the act ends with her sitting alone on the stage.
The next act focuses on Onegin and Lensky, but perhaps the most entertaining character is Monsieur Triquet (Joseph Frank). Triquet is French and is visiting a friend in Russia. He sings a song to Tatiana with lyrics so amusing to the crowd that Olga audibly laughs in the middle of a verse. The party guests applaud him when he stops, but once they stop, he starts again. 
It is at this same party that Lensky and Onegin agree to duel, resulting from jealousy and conflict over Olga. 
The duel is regarded as one of the most important points of both the opera and the novel. It is a powerful scene in which two friends must fight because of a rash decision made at a party. It results in the death of Lensky, who feels that he has lost everything anyway, having told Olga the night before, “farewell... forever.”
The end of the opera takes place in a palace in St. Petersburg, and Tatiana is shown as a changed woman. Now married to Prince Gremin (Oren Gradus), she is no longer the country girl she used to be. In earlier scenes, her hair was worn down and her dresses were usually white and simple. 
Here, her hair is elaborately styled and she wears a bright red gown with elbow-length gloves and glittering jewels. It is clear that she has changed to become something completely different from before. Onegin attends the ball and sees her, deciding that he is in love with her.
Perhaps the most entertaining part of this scene is when Onegin realizes that he loves Tatiana. His enthusiasm is comical, and his facial expression is like that of a child. 
His grin takes over his face, and he looks toward the ceiling, hands clasped under his chin. This, coming from a character that is very stoic through the rest of the opera, was surprising and showed a marked change in Onegin.
The final scene takes place in a private room in the palace with Tatiana and Onegin. He begs her to leave her husband for him, and she refuses, even after admitting that she still loves him. She bids him farewell forever and leaves the stage. Onegin, crushed and kneeling on the floor hunched over, is the last image shown in the opera.
While the singing, set, and costumes were all very important to bringing out the emotion and meaning in the show, it would be wrong to leave out the influence and importance of the orchestra.
Conducted by Antony Walker, the music provided the perfect backdrop for all of the events. The intensity or calmness of the music drove the emotional feeling even in large scenes, and Walker’s animated movements contributed to the feelings evoked by the opera as a whole.
This tragic story of friends and lovers who must be parted was a huge success on the stage, with shouts of “bravo” coming from the audience at the end of nearly every song. All of the emotions transmitted through the singing of the very talented cast contributed to a highly successful rendition of Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin.

Eugene Onegin will have additional performances at the Benedum Center on Sept. 29, Oct. 2, and Oct. 4. Find out more information at pittsburghopera.org.

Eat, Pray, Love is the memoir of Elizabeth Gilbert, who travels across Italy, India, and Indonesia to pursue pleasure, devotion, and a balance of the two.
After her divorce, Gilbert decides to discover what she really wants in life and goes on a personal journey across nations to find her balance. She “tells the truth” through 108 tales, distributed equally among all three countries, and she has the same number of stories as the numbers of beads of the japa mala. Japa malas, literally meaning prayer necklaces, are strings of 108 beads used by Hindu and Buddhist monks to repeat a mantra on every bead.
Concentrating on her spiritual journey through this mala, Gilbert first takes us to Italy. There, she spends four months, learning Italian and eating gelato for breakfast in Rome and pizza in Naples. During her time in Italy, she rediscovers what pleasure means. Making new friends and learning the Italian way of living, she explores the meaning of the word pleasure and what it means to enjoy life. Truly in love with Rome, she tries to understand if Rome is where she belongs. Her friend Guilo tells her how “the secret to understanding a city and its people is to learn — what is the word on the street?” While for Rome the word may be “sex” and for the Vatican “power,” Gilbert tries to find out the word that describes her. At the end of her time in Italy, she decides to attaversare, meaning cross over, to her next country.
Trading worldly pleasures for an austere life, Gilbert then heads to an ashram in India. She tries to get used to a simple life of doing seva, or social service, and performing meditation. During her time in India, she describes her struggles with meditation and leading an austere life and how she manages to find her divine connection. At the ashram, Gilbert meets Richard from Texas, who nicknames her Groceries and guides her through her internal struggles. Any reader who has ever tried meditating on a regular basis may have encountered struggles like Gilbert did, and her having achieved a state of meditation gives hope to all the readers that they can achieve it too. 
To combine the lives of pleasure and devotion and find a life of balance between the two, Gilbert’s final destination is Bali in Indonesia. She meets the medicine man, Ketut Liyer, and lives in Bali for the next four months improving his English and learning more about his practices. She also meets Wayan, a Balinese healer and a single mother, and becomes good friends with her. Growing close to her, she raises funds to help build a permanent house for Wayan and learns how things work differently in Bali, especially when one is a foreigner. She also meets Felipe, a Brazilian jeweler living in Bali. She comes to terms with love in Bali, where she starts dating Felipe, whom she later marries. At the end of her year-long journey, Gilbert learns more about herself and decides to attaversare into her new found life.
Last Monday, Gilbert kicked off this year’s Drue Heinz lecture series at the Carnegie Music Hall. Gilbert was recently in Rome for the filming of the movie Eat, Pray, Love starring Julia Roberts and Javier Bardem. She read an introduction to her forthcoming book Committed, which is about how she came to terms with marriage, especially after her first unsuccessful one.
Answering questions from her admirers, she gave advice to budding writers and mentioned how she has no trouble “telling the truth” about her life. She mentioned that even though people think that she has achieved a perfect life, nobody’s life is perfect every day. Each day is a new struggle to make it the ideal day. Lastly, she closed her talk by telling us all how we should try to live our dreams, one step at a time. It may not happen overnight, but if we keep working toward our goals, we will achieve them.
Eat, Pray, Love is every person’s journey and what each of us decides to do with it. It truly is, as the cover says, “one woman’s search for everything across Italy, India, and Indonesia.” The book is about asking yourself the right questions for discovering your own life. It is a memoir and a travelogue — have an inward odyssey while traveling the world with Gilbert.

Director Neill Blomkamp and producer Peter Jackson team up in this fall’s new science fiction film District 9. This movie is based on the short film Alive in Joburg, released in 2005, which deals with the issues of social segregation, xenophobia, and racism (in the form of speciesism) between humans and aliens. The movie’s title and plot were inspired by the events that took place in South Africa during the apartheid regime in 1966 in a place called District Six in Cape Town. During that time, 60,000 people were forcibly removed from District Six, and the area was declared as “whites only” by the government.
The film begins in Johannesburg, South Africa as a documentary type film and has interviews from all departments of Multinational United (MNU), a private military contractor, in which people describe the situation they were in. An alien spaceship had stopped over this city in 1982 and was stranded due to the loss of its command module. When the malnourished aliens, or “prawns” as they are called, are found, they are placed in District 9, separate from the humans.
This place soon becomes a slum and a breeding ground for illegal activities, such as black market weapon sales and prostitution. Wikus can der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), an MNU field operative, is assigned to lead the relocation of the aliens to District 10, farther away from the angry citizens. During the relocation, Wikus raids one of the alien’s houses and he discovers a small canister containing a drop of chemical liquid that he accidentally sprays onto his face, after which he passes out and is taken to the hospital. The doctor discovers that Wikus’ left forearm has mutated into an alien appendage and Wikus is immediately isolated by MNU. The MNU team realizes now that Wikus had mutated DNA in his alien hand he can operate the alien weapons that humans weren’t able to utilize.
In a panic, Wikus escapes from MNU as a fugitive and takes residence in the one place he knew they wouldn’t look for him — District 9. There, he once again meets the alien whom he had taken the canister from. The alien sees Wikus’ physique and immediately realizes what has happened. The alien explains that the canister contains just enough liquid for him to fly to the mother ship and leave the planet. According to the alien, the mother ship has medical equipment that would transform Wikus back to his human form, so Wikus and the alien decide to invade MNU in order to retrieve the canister. But, in order to do so, they will need some alien weaponry, and Wikus goes to the black market to obtain some.
At the black market, Wikus runs into some trouble when the leader of a gang captures Wikus and tries to cut his arm off. Wikus, however, grabs an alien weapon, overpowers his captors, and escapes with some weapons. Upon breaking into MNU offices, Wikus finds the canister while the alien mourns his fallen friend, whom, the alien realizes, has been subjected to medical experiments by MNU.
After returning to District 9 with the canister, the alien decides that he wants to go to his home planet and seek help for his people before curing Wikus. However, the alien told Wikus that this would take three years and promised to come back for Wikus. In a whirl of anger and frustration, Wikus knocks the alien out and, with the help of the alien’s son, powers up the command module only to be shot down soon afterward by MNU. Wikus and the alien are captured by MNU, and the movie takes some interesting plot twists and leaves the audience curious about their fate.
This film really keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The movie, with its documentary style filming, makes the film seem rather realistic. It also portrays an important message about the world’s police and how they respond to situations like segregation and racism. Wikus is a character that is confusing because he doesn’t seem like an antagonist, nor does he seem like a protagonist, so the audience can decide whether to cheer or boo this main character. District 9 is a film that will keep you interested and definitely make you think.

You’ll have to forgive me if I don’t feel like writing about music today. It’s a cold and rainy Saturday morning, about the usual I would expect from a Pittsburgh fall, but in light of the past few days’ events, I can’t help but feel uneasy. Sure, there’s been that overwhelming sense of doom since all the helicopters, barricades, and “less lethal” weaponry started arriving, but now it’s that calm period, that waiting to see when it’s all going to be over and we can have our city back. A little while ago, I was reading David Foster Wallace’s essay published in the early ’90s about the then-new David Lynch film Lost Highway. As he discusses various reasons why this film is (going to be) awesome, he mentions an aspect of why Lynch’s films are also really unpleasant to watch. “We need to believe,” he writes, “that our own hideousness and darknesses are secret.” 
We’ve all had that experience reading a book or watching a movie and suddenly it’s over and you feel absolutely miserable and hopeless about this whole “being a human” business. I had this reaction most strongly while watching the latest Batman installment, The Dark Knight. I saw this movie three times in the theater, and unlike other movies where once you know how it ends you become less responsive, I became increasingly more upset each time I saw it. Part of what was frustrating about this experience was not being able to put my finger on what exactly it was that troubled me so much. A good friend of mine went with me every time to see the movie and had a similar reaction. For months, neither of us could figure out what it was about The Dark Knight that was so upsetting. At different points along the way, we made small progresses — something about the capacity and affinity in all of us to be violent and destructive, the mirror between Batman and the role of the United States, the idea of there being nowhere safe and no one to trust — but for the most part, the only thing we were ever really certain of was that the movie seemed to pull something together for us, even though we weren’t sure what that thing was.
So all week I’ve been thinking about The Dark Knight, and I have that same feeling I did each time I left the theater, taking the long road home, lying in bed and thinking about how quickly everything can be turned on its head. We know that something big has happened; that something has been set into motion that cannot be taken back. And maybe I’m being melodramatic about this; maybe by the time you are reading this Monday morning, Pittsburgh will have returned to its regularly scheduled programming. But my guess is that something’s changed, even if, like The Dark Knight, it’s going to take me a while to realize what exactly that means.

Dear Rohit,
What do you think about online dating? My real life experience hasn’t been all too great. It’s so much easier online, and you can learn whether somebody would be compatible with you even before meeting them. What’s your say?
— Online Dating Devotee
Dear ODD,
I’ve experimented with online dating myself (have you tried match.com?) and it definitely has its pros and cons. Sure, it seems like you can get some idea of your compatibility with a person before meeting them, but that doesn’t mean it will turn out the way you think.
You might have a lot in common with somebody who turns out to be an ultra-weird mustache-fetishist pediatrician (unless you’re into that, in which case, that’s... great for you) or somebody who turns out to be a 500-pound middle-aged guy named Mike instead of a 19-year-old blonde. Besides, you always have to factor in the chance that your blind date will kill you — always take your first dates to well-lit, crowded places or take along a burly friend. With all that said, online dating can be a great way to build up your confidence, and you might — just might — actually meet somebody that you would be happy with.
So, I would say keep it up, but be really careful. A much easier and successful way, though, according to me, would be to join a new club, take up a new sport, or volunteer somewhere; trying something new is a great way to meet new people, not to mention a great way to learn about yourself. Oh, and one more thing: If you find a site that is really good, send me an e-mail!
Dating is reality,
— Rohit
Dear Rohit,
I have a huge crush on the TA for a course I am taking this semester. Every time I am in recitation, I have very naughty thoughts. I have spoken to him quite a bit after class — course material only, mind you. Should I ask him out yet?
— I Love Recitation
Dear Recitation,
That’s messy, but not something I can’t help you handle. Look on the bright side: At least you’re not thinking about romancing a professor. A TA, on the other hand, is so much more within your reach. You don’t always have to meet him in a classroom setting; you can try and run into him somewhere else on campus and then you would be more like peers than teacher and student.
But hold on just a minute. The semester is only four months long. When he’s no longer your TA, there is no harm in the two of you dating. But if you ask him out right now, it could mean a lot of trouble (issues with partiality and whatnot). If you really like him, then he’s worth the wait. If not, then look in the mirror and ask yourself: Are you excited by him or by the teacher-student fling idea? Meanwhile, hit those books hard to impress him.
The wait is worth it,
— Rohit

In an article entitled “Widths of Country Roads in America and Germany,” a staffwriter describes the practicality of the American road system and its lack of automotive traffic. Clearly, this writer never had to get from Interstate 279 to the Fort Pitt Tunnel during commuting hours.

An ad for Swingline staplers boasts that one is “no bigger than a pack of gum,” costs just 98 cents, and includes 1000 staples. Man, Milton from the flick Office Space was totally born in the wrong time period.

In an interview with The Tartan, Richard M. Cyert declares that the new SEI building won’t do work related to warfare. Despite the fact that it has been a frequent site of anti-war protests since its construction, this writer couldn’t find any articles related to warfare research by the SEI, so they’ve at least done a good job of covering their tracks.

“Football team deserves more support” is the title of a Forum piece lamenting the dismal crowds at home games, which mostly include family and friends of the players. It’s good to see that some things never change. In all seriousness, though, you should support our excellent football team, especially against our rivals at Case Western.

“Student Subpoena” is the title of a News article stating that a senior computer science major, along with service provider Calyx, was issued a subpoena due to accusations of voter intimidation. I would venture a guess that more people, at least on this campus, would be more opposed to voter pestering or annoyance than intimidation.

A “How Things Work” article focuses on Heliodisplay, also known as the projection of an image on a floating screen of air, often resembling a holographic 3D image. So Star Wars and Star Trek fans can rejoice that some day soon, they will be able to send their images across the galaxy for aliens to laugh at and make fun of.

his past week, in light of the G20, students from Carnegie Mellon transformed the Fence into a patchwork quilt of political messages. However, many of the messages themselves were left unclear, and the site of what appeared to be a spray-painted junkyard imprisoning the Fence generated a feeling of opposition and disdain for the project. Those involved were left with a whole mess of misconception to sort out.
Truth be told, there seemed to be a lot of rumors going around about the intentions of those involved in Project Shantytown. “I kind of like the legend of it all,” said Austin Redwood, also a senior in the BHA program. “That is why I haven’t been very vigilant about turning out rumors.”
The G20, established in 1999, is a group of 20 international finance ministers and bank governors who come together once a year to discuss the global economy, and opposition against the conference is usually due to the exclusivity of it all. 
This year, with the conference held right here in Pittsburgh, opposition forces have been plentiful, especially here at Carnegie Mellon. However, those opposed to the student activity at the Fence were not necessarily in favor of the G20. A majority of the opposition facing Project Shantytown was mainly because of its aesthetics. 
“I don’t particularly see what their stance on the G20 is,” said Ila Foley, a sophomore English major, “so I don’t think it’s a particularly effective protest. I don’t understand what they’re trying to get across; it’s just a shantytown. I only saw one piece of art that actually said ‘G20 GTFO,’ so other than that, it really just looks like a bunch of frat boys camped out at the Fence.”
Because of the peculiar way in which those at the Fence went about protesting the G20, most onlookers assumed the worst. “Apparently people thought we weren’t even students,” said Redwood. “They would yell at us, ‘If you don’t go here, you can’t have the Fence,’ and then we would poke our heads out and they would be like, ‘Oh, I’m in a class with you.’ ”
The best way to solve a confusing problem is to head straight to the source. In the heart of the Carnegie Mellon shantytown, over a soundtrack of hammering and laughter, Redwood was ready and willing to set the record straight. “This is the CMU G20 Arts Base,” said Redwood. “It is a space in which people can build things and express themselves in relation to the G20. We see that people don’t get a voice when summits like this come to town and we wanted to utilize a space in which they could make banners, have discussions, hold workshops, screen films, and give their side of the argument. The world leaders aren’t necessarily going to hear what we have to say, but we can at least hear it ourselves.”
It turns out there was a lot more to this shantytown than expected. All throughout G20 week, students and professors alike gathered at the CMU G20 Arts Base to host parades, screen films, listen to lectures, and even participate in religious sermons. But as visitors soon found out, there was a reason for the Arts Base’s less-than-appealing exterior. 
“We basically built a shantytown because we wanted to at least reference a little of the political impoverishment that comes with not being able to attend certain meetings that decide the fate of a lot of people,” said Redwood. “Here we’re trying to build a structure that can evolve, that anybody can add on to. All of the art you see in here is somehow related to people’s ability to create something for themselves. We’ve created a shelter for ourselves, very literally, but also a political shelter where we can foster ideas safely.”
Those involved with the CMU G20 Arts Base know that not everybody has understood their metaphor. “The idea of a shanty is so foreign for this atmosphere; just the juxtaposition of that image, I feel, has been really powerful for those who realize it is a shanty and associate it to shelter,” said Carolina Ramos, a senior in the Bachelor of Humanities and Arts program. “A lot of people can’t even make that foreign association because we’re so privileged. I think that end of it has been an interesting message about poverty and about how sheltered we truly happen to be.”
The CMU G20 Arts Base has also been a center for those students managing independent G20 art projects to convene. All over campus you can find their work, from stickers to sidewalk chalk to yarn sculpture. Projects have been as simple as wheat-pasted flyers stating “<3 G20” or as complicated as a gigantic “HELP WANTED” poster that covered the entire intramural field. Whatever the project, it’s clear that Carnegie Mellon students want to have their opinions heard.
With few limitations, no part of the campus has been left untouched. In windows and archways all over Carnegie Mellon, students have seen the eyes of Big Brother, a character from George Orwell’s novel 1984, staring back at them. “The half faces are the workings of Nina Sarnelle,” said Redwood. “They are referencing the hopeless non-transparency of the G20 and how we are left only to watch these world leaders. We see what they do and decide when they discuss all of these important topics that affect our lives behind closed doors and we wanted to narrate the Orwellian fiction a little bit.”
Aside from the shantytown’s appearance, there is a plethora of other ways in which the G20 Arts Base has been misunderstood, and members involved were eager to explain. “We had a really unorthodox way of building in this space; we just took the Fence and started building our shantytown,” said Redwood. “People have been saying we took it from the [Pi Kappa Alpha] pledges, when actually, we lent it to them; so maybe we can set that straight. We had the Fence and the pledges were really nervous because they didn’t want to be out here in November, so we lent part of the Fence to them. They were fine neighbors.”
Many reported hearing that those camped at the Fence were serving punishment for their actions. “That’s a really funny story; I’ve heard we got up to $1,000 in fire hazard fines,” said Ramos. “The officers just came to tell us that we couldn’t use tarps, so we stopped using tarps, simple as that.”
The artists and protesters at the G20 Arts Base have tried to remain optimistic. Through all of the negative publicity and rumors, they have kept their shanty house doors wide open. Redwood put it best when he said, “we like building and talking and teaching and learning, even with those who disapprove of what we’re doing. Tell people to come by.” In this glance into the inside of the G20 Arts Base, one thing became increasingly clear: You can’t judge a movement by its appearance, even if it really looks down in the dumps.

Leaders of the world’s most prominent industrialized nations gathered in Pittsburgh last week for what will become a regular meeting to make economic decisions that will impact the economy of the world.
This group of 20, or G20 Summit, ran over two days, with dignitaries arriving Thursday for a working dinner hosted by President Obama at Phipps Conservatory. The Summit itself was held on Friday at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center downtown. It began at 9:30 a.m. and concluded with press conferences given by leaders from various countries at around 5 p.m., with Obama’s conference kicking off the string of meetings to follow.
Before discussing the results of the Summit, which focus on stabilizing the market and preventing another economic crisis like the one of fall 2008, Obama stressed the importance of nations’ working together to solve problems and thanked the people and the city of Pittsburgh for hosting the summit.
Many of the leaders, he said, were “so impressed with the revitalization of city” since their last visits, reinforcing Obama’s choice to hold the Summit in Pittsburgh. Another signature Pittsburgh feature the leaders were impressed by was a breakfast food.
Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama ate breakfast at Pamela’s in Millvale and was very pleased with the pancakes he was served.
“I’m a little resentful that I didn’t get to Pamela’s for pancakes,” Obama joked.
Despite the lighthearted comments, Obama soon explained the results of the conference, and the four main points that the delegation agreed upon.
First, he said, was sustaining recovery plans until economic growth is restored not just for the upper classes and businesses, but also for the working and middle class families who need to be able to pay their bills. “We can’t tolerate the same old boom and bust economy of the past,” he said.
To achieve this, he said, it was important to implement “tough, new financial regulations.” More transparency in business is a key element of this point. “Those who abuse the system must be held responsible,” he emphasized.
A second point of the plan ties executive pay to long-term performance rather than short-term.
The third element is to phase out subsidies for fossil fuels, which will increase our energy security and decrease the “threat posed by climate change.”
The fourth point builds on Obama’s earlier remarks about nations working together and reforms the system of global economic cooperation and governance. This means that rather than only including already-powerful industrial nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will begin to include emerging economies as well, and a new World Bank Trust Fund will be established.
“The nations of the world share mutual interests,” he said, and stressed that they should “act on behalf of shared prosperity.”
The cooperation on which Obama spoke Friday has been seen already in the response to Iran’s nuclear facilities. Intelligence agencies from the United States, the United Kingdom, and France each investigated whether Iran’s statements about their facilities were truthful or whether they were in violation of international laws. After they confirmed the violation, other countries, including China and Russia, joined these countries in condemning Iran’s actions.
Leaders from these countries will be meeting with Iran on Oct. 1 to try to solve the problem diplomatically, but Obama said that he would not rule out any options or possibilities for further action. “Iran is on notice. They are going to have to come clean and make a choice,” he said. The first path leads to peace, and the second to confrontation.
While these things were occurring on the international political fronts, protesters gathered outside, surrounded by swarms of police dressed in riot gear.
All week, demonstrators have gathered to protest various causes, ranging from the war to capitalism to the G20 itself. Some protesters, like those desiring to free Tibet and the oppressed Chinese religious group Falun Gong, were peaceful, but other protests became riotous and violent.
Obama was not concerned about the riots. “It’s important to keep things in perspective,” he said. “In London, there were hundreds of thousands on the streets [as compared with the just over 5000 reported to be outside of the Convention Center]. Pittsburgh deserves credit for managing a very tranquil G20 Summit.”
While the Summit may have been “tranquil” compared to other Summits, the protesters certainly caused a stir in the city. 
Throughout the course of the week, nearly 20 businesses were damaged, reportedly by the same protesters from California, and over 100 people were arrested for refusal to disperse.
In Oakland last Thursday, students gathered to protest, and police broke up the group with the use of OC gas, which is slightly different from tear gas, as it is a different chemical compound more similar to pepper spray. To revolt against police actions, students gathered again Friday and were met with equally strong riot dispersal tactics.
Twitter updates and YouTube videos gave the world a close-up look at the police actions and protests happening in the city.
Two students from Carnegie Mellon created a website that compiled the most recent videos and Tweets relating to the G20. Haris Krijestorac and Manolis Kounelakis, master’s students in information systems management, originally did not intend for their website, www.exponentialweb.com, to focus on G20. “We both have many theories and ideas about where the social web is taking the world, and we wanted to share our youthful yet academic perspective with the world,” Krijestorac stated in an e-mail.
The site was created Sept. 20, and by Sept. 24, the first day of the Summit, Krijestorac and Kounelakis began posting live updates from social websites, allowing people to follow what was going on in real time.
“We hope that ExponentialWeb will not only give us the outlet to report social web news and express our opinions on the subject, but inspire others to engage in it,” Krijestorac wrote.
This website, as well as the original sites from which the material was taken, engaged many in the events of the weekend, supplementing traditional news sources with information straight from the participants.
Whether through protests, art, or social websites, very few people managed to avoid participating in one way or another in this event.

The Fence at Carnegie Mellon has traditionally been the meeting spot on campus where students’ voices resonate the loudest. 
On Saturday, a dozen protesters dressed in HAZMAT suits, green hard hats, and surgical masks gathered around the shantytown to educate passersby on the current problems regarding the G20 and climate change. Others marched around the Fence beating drums, and some created flags and signs that could be used during the rally.
One activist, Dea G, marching with the Green and Black Contingent, stood near the Fence to bring attention to the need for radicalism in the climate change policies discussed in the G20.
“The industrialization policies of the G20 have led to a complete destruction of our Earth,” G said. “Instead of asking Obama to make changes, [radicalism] means that if he doesn’t make a change, we will stand here and make the change ourselves.”
G’s message to Carnegie Mellon students was that although it is really easy to get trapped into a pattern of classes and activities, it is really important to become active.
During the week of the G20 conference, picket signs with pleas to world leaders lay strewn around the Fence as a part of a senior project for art students Carolina Ramos and Austin Redwood.
The purpose of their project was to create an art space in which people could tangibly advertise their take on the G20 summit. They used the Fence and its surrounding shantytown as a symbol of the great controversies that the G20 brought to Pittsburgh.
Dean of Student Affairs Karen D. Boyd felt that this shantytown resonated with the concept of students’ becoming involved in their passions, and said she believes that this is what Carnegie Mellon is all about.
From an administrative standpoint, Boyd is there to allow Ramos and Redwood to achieve their dreams and help them comply with the safety parameters in place. “I live in a country and a campus that shares the same beliefs as me, that the idea of the free exchange of ideas is always better,” Boyd said. “I believe more students need to engage and think about what they are engaging in; that’s the only way they will be able to grow.”
For example, a group came to the Fence to join a rally that wanted world leaders to focus on issues such as education, rather than ones such as militarism.
After making signs that read “Students, not Soldiers,” they hung up the signs as art in the shantytown. Boyd said that this physical expression of a social event truly embodies the purpose of the makeshift slum. The signs and protest later made the New York Times.
Ramos and Redwood exemplified the engagement that both Boyd and G encourage. Ramos, who has been working extensively with her partner Redwood, was inspired to build the slum culture as her project to visually represent those who are unrepresented in the G20.
“I have a lot of separate issues that I think the G20 could express, but as I see it, all they are focusing their energy on is the massive amount of money they are going to be redistributing to the International Monetary Fund,” Ramos said. “I think the IMF is an organ of government that has caused a lot more harm than good to the world.”
She feels that the structural readjustment policies threaten the social safety nets of the individuals that live in poverty. In order to express her passion for this issue, Ramos and Redwood set up the shantytown to represent three different aspects of the G20.
First, Ramos painted a utopian kingdom on one of the makeshift walls to represent the idealism that is often associated with the G20.
Boyd interpreted that on one side of this wall is art that represents what some students feel is the reality of the conference. Graffiti with messages of despair and broken, boarded walls surround this section. This section is to represent those who are unrepresented and often lost in the sea of poverty.
Boyd said that the final section of the structure is to represent that even those who live in middle class America are affected by the lack of progress made in the G20.
A major aspect of this set up, however, is that the Fence expresses not only the idea of the founders of the project, but the beliefs and ideologies of every passerby who wishes to contribute to the structure.
Boyd feels that all students, in one way or another, should get involved and truly interact in what they are passionate about. Her belief in freedom of expression held strong even when the Fence was taken over by Kappa Sigma on the night of Sept. 24.
“Another exciting thing is that the frat took the Fence, and that’s an example of freedom of expression too,” Boyd said. “Now they are coexisting with the shantytown, which just reinforces what it means to be a part of Carnegie Mellon.”
As Boyd states, the Fence is a way to express the frustrations and passions of the people, but it is also a way to document some of the major themes that have surrounded the G20.

As part of the G20 events on Carnegie Mellon’s campus, Kevin Rudd, prime minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, delivered a keynote address to the campus community last Thursday. The prime minister was among the 20 heads of state present in the city to discuss issues pertinent to global economic recovery.
After introducing the prime minister, Matthew Craig, a master’s student from Heinz College Australia, and Patrick Bourke, a doctoral student in electrical and computer engineering, reflected on how their Carnegie Mellon education coincides with Australia’s vision of global cooperation on all levels.
“Australia has a long history of pragmatic and socially responsible public policy, and the Heinz College is an excellent fit there,” said Craig, a resident of Adelaide.
The Heinz College Australia, an extension of the Heinz College in Pittsburgh, began operations in 2006 and has produced over 130 graduates. Carnegie Mellon is the first foreign university to have been granted permission to offer its own degree program in Australia.
“This university has grown to become one of the great American universities,” said Rudd. “It is a global research university that is making a great contribution to higher education in Australia,” he said.
The prime minister also recognized Andrew Carnegie’s instrumental role in the progress of the steel industry in the past and the present leadership of Carnegie Mellon in technology and innovation.
“But Carnegie’s university, rather than a steel company, is what provided a transformational vehicle for the old city of heavy industry to become the new city of the future, one grounded in the globalizing knowledge economy of the 21st century,” Rudd said.
“The prime minister has been among the most outspoken and most forceful heads of government in the world when it comes to global warming,” said Carnegie Mellon President Jared L. Cohon. “Unlike heads of most governments in the world, he has made actual commitments, something we all should be very grateful for. His leadership has had a big impact,” he said.
Rudd displayed his knowledge of Pittsburgh’s history and culture, blending humor with relevant facts about the G20 host city and its historic feat at economic recovery since the collapse of the steel industry.
“This is my first time to Pittsburgh, and my first time to this university. So as a very proud self-proclaimed nerd, I sat down last night to Google a little about what I was to come to discover here in Pittsburgh,” said Rudd. “And knowing that I’ll be speaking to a room full of nerds, I thought you’d appreciate that,” he added, drawing laughter from the audience.
The prime minister said that while the agenda of the G20 is broad, it essentially deals with “two sets of fundamental threats to our common future: the global financial crisis and the looming crisis of climate change.” He also said that these two themes make Pittsburgh an ideal location for this Summit.
“Pittsburgh harbors a culture of constant reinvention. Both these crises represent transformational opportunities for the future, transformational opportunities for the world, just as you have succeeded in transforming this great city,” said Rudd.
The prime minister went on to focus on strong climate change policies as a catalyst in triggering lasting economic progress. He stressed the importance of carbon capture and sequestration — an area he said was of crucial concern to the G20.
“Climate change presents a long-term threat to our planet,” said Rudd.
He explained that by 2020, between 75 and 250 million people could be exposed to climate change-induced water shortages. Also, rain-fed agricultural yields could drop by 50 percent in some African countries. Further, rising sea levels could affect more than 1 million people in such countries as Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Egypt. If due action is avoided, global temperatures could rise more than 10 degrees Fahrenheit within this century alone.
“These changes will affect everyone, irrespective of nation or people — this is a global challenge requiring a global response,” said Rudd.
“I think that [Rudd’s] explanations of the numbers related to the carbon emission reduction, and sequestration projects over the country really show how important he thinks the problem is,” said Urmila Rosario, a junior in business administration.
“I really think that this makes him unique in comparison to the other leaders of developed countries, but then again, I think that all world leaders talk too much and actually do nothing,” she said.
Rudd also talked about the significant role that educated youth plays in bringing about a positive change in both the economic and environmental architecture of the post-crisis world.
“Our core challenge will be to convert adversity into opportunity, threat into possibility, and deploy the technologies that lie within our reach and the finance necessary to deploy them to deal with climate change, and as a result, create new skills, jobs, and industries for American and global economies for the 21st century,” the prime minister said.
A panel discussion on the prime minister’s talk and the G20 agenda followed the keynote address. Meanwhile, the prime minister spoke to the local and school media in a separate press conference. During the press conference, he elaborated further on how the G20 will aim to transform the global economy to a lower carbon world through carbon markets, private and public global finance, and applicable technology platforms.

Bill Gates, co-chair and trustee of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and chairman of Microsoft Corp., dedicated the Gates Center for Computer Science to the future of technological progress at Carnegie Mellon.
“It is an honor and privilege to be involved with Carnegie Mellon,” said Gates in a keynote address to students and faculty. A ribbon-cutting ceremony followed the address.
“I’m always inspired when I come here — inspired by the great minds that are here and the ones that will be coming here,” said Gates. “I’ll be following your work, and I can’t wait to see these great advances [that] are delivered and the progress that will enable.”
The Gates Center adjoins the Hillman Center for Future-Generation Technologies, another research building where principles of computer science and robotics will be applied at a larger scale. Together, these two buildings house the School of Computer Science (SCS), which contains classrooms, offices, research space, and a 360-foot long helix.
Designed by the renowned Mark Scogin Merrill Elam Architects of Atlanta, Ga., the centers sit at the crossroads of the campus, connecting it literally from one end to the other. The new complex has five main entrances, as well as two pedestrian bridges branching out to major parts of the campus, including Newell-Simon Hall.
The Randy Pausch Memorial Footbridge, a separate bridge that will be dedicated to late computer science professor Randy Pausch as a tribute to his vision for marrying areas of computer science with those of the arts, extends from the Gates Center to the edge of the Purnell Center for the Arts, the facility that houses the university’s School of Drama.
“It is great to see the ambition taking place in this particular project that the Foundation is helping to fund,” Gates said of the new research center dedicated by his foundation.
Gates previously visited Carnegie Mellon last February. He was once again welcomed to the campus last Tuesday afternoon by a throng of students and faculty members in Wiegand Gymnasium, University Center, where he shared his thoughts on the university’s technological initiatives, as well as technological outreach worldwide.
“Pioneering work in computer science has been going on [at Carnegie Mellon] for over half a century,” said Gates.
Gates acknowledged the far-reaching accomplishments of the SCS in computer science, robotics, human-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence. He also recognized the school’s Open Learning Initiative: a project that uses online interactive material to adapt to students’ learning needs. It enables professors to gauge classroom performance and spot where gaps in knowledge need to be filled in.
The potential for using computing in areas like computational biology will not only continue, but accelerate, he said.
“Robotics is a great example — whether it’s learning, vision, speech-recognition, or mechanical modeling — all of these things get pushed to the state-of-the art here; [Carnegie Mellon] has been a leader in that,” said Gates.
“The layout of this new complex strengthens the collaboration between different fields of study — an important trend here at Carnegie Mellon,” Carnegie Mellon President Jared L. Cohon said.
Students and faculty of the School of Computer Science moved into the new buildings in August.
“The Gates Center provides an absolutely wonderful environment for computer science projects,” said Hatem Alismail, a master’s student at the Robotics Institute in the SCS.
Computer science Ph.D. student and another occupant of the Gates complex, Stephanie Rosenthal, stated in an e-mail, “The complex is an amazing space — the windows make it feel so much brighter in the building. I’m always discovering a new alcove or meeting space. The common areas and offices are comfortable places to work and collaborate with my peers.”
Bernardine Dias, an assistant research professor in the Robotics Institute, said, “The new complex is an inviting space for people crossing the borders of all disciplines and reaching out to each other; it is very accessible.”
“This university earned its reputation by marching in the direction of new concepts with a vision and courage to go where others would not tread,” said Randal E. Bryant, dean of the School of Computer Science. “And this has been a catalyst for us to grow in our partnership with our contributors,” he said.
According to a Carnegie Mellon press release, a $20 million gift from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and a $10 million gift from the Henry L. Hillman Foundation led to the completion of this new research complex.
“The generosity of the Gates and Hillman Foundations and our many other donors will have a lasting impact on our university,” said Cohon. “These buildings have already transformed our campus, making it more cohesive, more functional, and more beautiful. They have been designed from the ground up to meet the needs of our computer science students and faculty, whose work continues to transform science, society, and the arts.”
Carnegie Mellon’s long-standing tradition of collaborative work appeared to be in sync with Gates’ vision for the future of learning on a global scale.
“We need to revolutionize education,” said Gates. “The experience that [students] have at Carnegie Mellon is unfortunately an exception, not the rule,” he said.
Gates also said that having a sound and up-to-date education is one of the most critical steps toward personal and professional development, as well as global socioeconomic progress. On his philanthropic efforts, Gates said that it “is fun giving money away and seeing it being used wisely.”
“This is an historic day not just for the School of Computer Science, but for all of Carnegie Mellon University ... and for all of Pittsburgh,” said Cohon. “It signifies the absolutely crucial role that this [university] plays ... in the world,” he said.

The varied roles of performance as a part of protest, as a means of communication, and as a form of collective democracy were the focus of “Power, Protest, Performance: A Panel Discussion,” held last Wednesday.
Organized by Paul Eiss, director of Carnegie Mellon’s Center for Arts in Society (CAS), the panel was made up of three experts on tactical performance: Larry Bogad, distinguished lecturer in performance and politics at the University of California; Richard Maddox, professor of anthropology and history at Carnegie Mellon; and Wendy Arons, associate professor of drama at Carnegie Mellon.
The main speaker, Larry Bogad, highlighted the importance of “performative disruption” with examples from his experiences working with guerrilla theater groups including the Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army (CIRCA) and the Yes Men. 
These groups attempt to “get a dialogue going where we can explore not just what we are saying, but how we say it,” Bogad said. One such example was the creation of the Oil Enforcement Agency — an agency devoted to ending what George W. Bush, in his 2006 State of the Union address, called “America’s addiction to oil.”
“There was a great space between [Bush’s] rhetoric and reality. This space becomes a place for performers to dance,” Bogad said. 
The agency was deployed during the 2006 Los Angeles Auto Show, where the it tied crime scene tape around large vehicles, claiming that they were protecting the public from oil addiction. CIRCA, another of Bogad’s creations, is described on the website clownarmy.org as “approximate and ambivalent ... the place in-between order and chaos.” 
CIRCA is known for showing up to protests and marches, interrupting rising tensions with spectacle. 
“The most intense moments of conflict can be defused by providing protest in a different form,” Eiss said. “You must be the absurd change you wish to see,” Bogad said.
Following Bogad were Wendy Arons and Richard Maddox, who both explored broader concepts pertaining to the G20 Summit. Arons’ discussion, entitled “Why Am I Wearing this Polar Bear Mask?” discussed the history of dramatic masking in relation to Section 601.19, a highly debated motion prohibiting the use of “masks, hoods, or other identity-concealing devices” during protests. Arons surmised that perhaps the law was asking the wrong question. 
“We should not ask, why do individuals wear masks, but what happens when they do so,” said Arons. The effect of the mask is universal — it licenses uncommon and often unruly behavior. 
“If we deny the power of the mask to move the wearer, we forget the joy of metamorphosis and change,” said Aron.
Maddox’s piece was entitled “Domestication, Disorder, and the Pittsburgh G20.” The G20 is a spectacle of legitimation for world leaders. Their main political agenda is to show the world that the right people are in charge and making correct decisions,” said Maddox. 
The choice to hold the G20 in Pittsburgh has brought this spectacle to the university’s backyard. This choice has had dramatic effects on the city. 
“The messes of the past and present are to be swept under the rug.... There’s a tremendous sense of popular resentment; it isn’t our city or our people being represented,” said Maddox.
While “Power, Protest, Performance” focused heavily on the concept of performance, the questions raised by the panel reached past the form of protest and outside of the realm of the arts. 
“The panel was really positive and gave a lot of interesting facts pertaining to protests and protesters,” said Marielle Saums, a first-year art student. 
The idea of involvement was also crucial, whether it takes the form of voting, protesting, or performance. “We hope people walk away thinking not just about performance or about the G20, but asking ‘Do we have a collective role in democracy?’ ” said Eiss.

Carnegie Mellon student Elaine Lee has been awarded the Vanguard Women in Information Technology Scholarship for 2009 for her work in math and computer science.
Originally from New Jersey, Lee is a senior math major on the occupations research track and is looking at a minor in computer science and statistics.
“Math just made sense to me,” Lee said. Her interest in math, and specifically occupations research, sparked during her senior year of high school, where she and a partner participated in the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in 2006. Their project was about using genetic algorithms in order to solve the traveling salesman problem. At the competition, she met with the American Mathematical Society, which provided her with information about jobs for math majors once they leave college.
She was immediately drawn to the pamphlets about operations research. “They tackle interesting projects,” she said. “It’s about how to use resources as efficiently as possible.” From the math field, Lee hoped to go into whatever technical field she wanted.
Once she arrived at Carnegie Mellon, she also gained an appreciation for computer science and statistics.
The Vanguard Women scholarship grants merit-based financial aid of up to $8000 each year to any female college undergraduate studying computer science, computer engineering, web design, or any other field relating to information technology.
She first heard about the scholarship from Vanguard itself. After being turned down for an internship, she continued to receive news on their affairs. She occasionally “gets e-mails on scholarship opportunities and job opportunities.”
One day, Lee received an e-mail about the scholarship and decided to apply. She also received some information through Carnegie Mellon. To enter, she had to get a copy of her transcript in addition to completing an application. It included a personal statement of about 200–300 words in which she had to include the reasons why she should win the scholarship and what her future career plans were.
Ultimately, she would like to work for a company in which she could work on data analysis and simulation. She hopes her research could “come to some interesting conclusions that can influence the way we do things.” Lee shows particular interest in global warming and climate change. “The data just isn’t there,” she said, which she attributes to the reason so few bills on the subject get passed. “There’s not a lot of work going on in that area.”
One of Lee’s many accomplishments on campus was a computer science research project her sophomore year. As part of the Intel First Year Research Experience (IFYRE), she worked with professor Martial Herbert on new video surveillance technologies. They focused on event detection in crowded videos. Lee said, “The goal of the research was to teach the computer to identify people.”
According to Lee, the most fulfilling class that she’s taken at Carnegie Mellon is data mining, which she is taking this semester. 
Part of the statistics department, the class is concerned with learning different techniques for extracting meaningful parts from large pools of information. “It was very real-world,” Lee said.
She traveled abroad during the spring semester of her junior year. She spent five months overseas at the University of Manchester, where she enjoyed the luxury of taking few technical classes and exploring Europe, including Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Italy, and France.
In addition to her course load, she’s part of the Student Technology Outreach Center on campus, in which she’s worked on a number of projects, from teaching basic courses on computing for students and adults to computer recycling.
Her plans for the award money? “Paying for tuition here,” she said.

Professor directs G20 orchestra
The head of the White House Cultural Office requested that Gregory Lehane, drama and music professor at Carnegie Mellon, direct a concert for First Lady Michelle Obama and the other spouses of the G20 world leaders last Friday morning. 
The performance was held at Pittsburgh’s Creative and Performing Arts (CAPA) High School downtown.
Lehane directed several CAPA students, as well as world-renowned cello player Yo-Yo Ma, country singer Trisha Yearwood, and singer-songwriter and pianist Sara Bareilles, who achieved popularity with her single “Love Song.”
Lehane has taught at Carnegie Mellon for two decades. Previously, he served as associate head and coordinator of the undergraduate and graduate directing programs in the School of Drama. 
Lehane is also a founding member of Primary Stages Company in New York City, and he has directed television programs for all three major networks, PBS, TBS, Lifetime, Nickelodeon, USA, and The Disney Channel.
He has also worked with television programs internationally, such as in London and France.
He has been nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Direction twice. Regionally, Lehane has directed programs for the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust and the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts.
Walking to the Sky art excavated
The infamous Walking to the Sky sculpture will see some construction this week, beginning today. The pole central to the art piece has often been seen wobbling, even in the face of no wind or compromising weather conditions. 
At one point, the art structure was anchored by two cement blocks attached to cables in order to keep the pole from swaying. A new stainless steel pole design that will replace the current structure is proposed to minimize movement and maximize the stability of the structure.
Jonathan Borofsky (A’64) designed the piece, located in front of Warner Hall.
The construction work will begin with an excavation of the base of the art piece. With the current plan, the existing sculpture will come down altogether beginning on Wednesday, and the construction work will continue for approximately two weeks. Most of the work will have to be done at the site of the sculpture; therefore, most of the Cut will be inaccessible during the time of construction. Other affected areas include the two sidewalks between Forbes Avenue and the far end of the Purnell Center for the Arts.

Leaders have been likened to many things. Most have been poetic: The Bible says leaders are like those who move boundary stones, and some music nerd on the Internet says leaders are like maestros — something about reaching beyond the notes to reach the magic in the players.
Then there are the less elegant metaphors. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been likened to a frumpy Hausfrau. French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been likened to a sex symbol, the 68th best-dressed person in the world, and even James Bond. George W. Bush has been likened to, well, an ape.
But with 20 of the most powerful people in the world strolling into Phipps Conservatory last Thursday, it was only natural to liken leaders to plants. After all, it was 20 of the world’s most powerful people in a super-green building, with presumably 20 species of the world’s greenest plants. Everyone was most likely caught up in a big hubbub of power, prestige, personalities, and... plants.
I’m no plant expert, but apparently some garden aficionados have a quiz you can take online called “Find Which Plant Reveals the Real You,” which will tell you how your “personal style translates into your plant personality.” I’ve always wanted to know! But this article isn’t about me. It’s about leaders. So I took the quiz for what I know about individual leaders of G20 economies. Since I regretfully do not know them on a personal level, I went off on a lot of presumptions and generalizations.
When I took the quiz for Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, I picked answers like “Zen-like balance and minimalism” and “Japanese silver grass.” When I took the quiz for Mexican President Felipe Calderon, I picked answers like “Mexican-inspired crafts and a wreath of dried chili peppers.” Dream house question? Nicolas Sarkozy matches with “Versailles” while Gordon Brown matches with “English cottage.” The quiz lent itself to presumptions and generalizations a little too easily.
It was then time to buckle down and scour the Phipps website in my search for analogous truth. I found that Russian President Dmitry Medvedev was most like a coneflower, which is a big, bold daisy that adds “oomph” to any garden. Medvedev isn’t bad looking himself, and quite the character, too. As a youth, he made copies of Deep Purple records, though they were on the state-issued blacklist. As a flower, the coneflower is purple. Tenuous connection? Well, ruminate on this: the coneflower attracts bees and butterflies, as does Medvedev, as evidenced by his lovely wife, Svetlana Medvedeva.
Our German Hausfrau Angela Merkel is quite like the bottlebrush buckeye. Consistently noted for her spot on Forbes’ Most Powerful Women, Merkel compares incredibly well to the exceptionally expansive suckering shrub. Meanwhile, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who as a boy studied by candlelight, can be compared to an azure sage, a perennial that can grow in poor soil conditions.
I got very excited when I came across an ugly carnivorous flytrap, immediately assigning it to Kim Jong Il. Then I realized that Kim Jong Il, his unfashionable gray pajamas, and his no-label sunglasses were nowhere near Pittsburgh. Kim Jong Il’s invitation wasn’t lost in the mail. It was never sent.
What about President Obama? No need to stretch our imaginations to find a plant for him. As of February, Dutch growers are developing a special chrysanthemum that is expected to sell 250 million in the next three years. Those Dutch flower growers like to capitalize off American Presidents. The Reagan flower also sold well. Bush? Not so much.
Time also recently did a number on the personalities of politicians. It likened Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to having the attractiveness rating of a church mouse and suggested Manmohan Singh’s speeches as a natural remedy for sleep disorders. My treatment of comparing leaders to plants is much kinder,  especially when all the aforementioned plants in this article are on the Phipps Conservatory Top 10 sustainable plant list for 2009.
Leadership? The ability of the plant to grow and encourage its fellow plants to thrive. Pittsburgh G20 Summit? All these sustainable plants coming together, minus the flytrap, to work toward sustainability, climate, and the environment.

I remember going to my senior prom in high school: spending all day getting dolled up — doing my hair, my nails, my make up; putting on the dress I had spent (too many) hours picking out; taking millions of pictures with all of my friends until we saw flashes every time we blinked; dancing away at the Hilton downtown for hours. And then I think about what my night would’ve been like if only some of my friends had been able to go with me, and I know it wouldn’t have been nearly as fun as it was.
Unfortunately, that is the kind of prom that students in Montgomery County, Ga. experience. In this county, segregated proms have been held almost every year since 1971, when its schools were integrated, according to a New York Times article. The white students attend prom on one night, and the black students attend a different prom on a different night; while no black students are allowed at the white students’ prom, white students are invited to the black students’ prom, though, according to the article, few actually show up.
It isn’t only in Montgomery County where segregated proms are a tradition. Last year, Morgan Freeman offered to pay for the first-ever integrated prom in his hometown in Mississippi. While students were open to the idea, the parents were against it and, according to the Times, organized a competing private prom on the same night.
It is the parents who seem to be central to the continuation of the segregated prom in Montgomery County, as well. The prom is not planned by the school but rather by outside committees of students and parents. According to the article, it is not the students that would have a problem with an interracial prom — friendships between black and white students are common — but rather, their parents.
“Most of the students do want to have a prom together. But it’s the white parents who say no.... They’re like, if you’re going with the black people, I’m not going to pay for it,” said Terra Fountain, a graduate of Montgomery County High School, in the article.
It’s hard to imagine that such blatant racism exists. And while the parents clearly are in the wrong in this situation — who goes against Morgan Freeman? — I cannot place the blame fully on them; the school’s administration and students are also at fault.
The parents are the most vocal about their opinions — they are doing almost everything they can to ensure that an integrated prom doesn’t happen, even if it means planning a rival prom on the same night. But this doesn’t mean that they have ultimate control over the situation. Are they in the wrong? Absolutely. Are they teaching their children a poor set of values, and making themselves look bad in the process? Definitely. But are they the only ones that have a say? No.
The students that are attending these segregated proms are at the end of their teenage years, getting ready for their first taste of independence — college. There, they will no longer be able to rely on their parents to tell them how to think and act, and they will have to make their own decisions about what they believe. They’re old enough to know right from wrong and to stand up for what they believe. This means that if they have friends of another race at school, they should be brave enough to want to spend time outside of school with them as well and share high school milestones like prom with them.
I fully believe that racism and discrimination is an important enough issue to risk going against one’s parents’ wishes. Why haven’t any of the students refused to attend their respective proms, or why haven’t they invited all of their friends — black or white — to join them, regardless of any rules their parents may have put in place regarding who is allowed to attend? The students here have a real chance to make a difference and to show their parents that their beliefs are wrong, but they ignore it for a night of dancing and partying with only a select group of their friends.
The administration, too, could have taken steps to combat the parents’ plans years ago by planning a school-sponsored prom open to all students. The New York Times article mentions that Luke Smith, the principal of Montgomery County High School, said that there are no plans for a school-sponsored prom in the future because at the last one, in 1995, attendance was poor.
But what Smith fails to realize is that one year is not enough of an effort to go against decades of tradition. Of course attendance was poor the first year; not only was it a huge change from the past, but it’s also likely that many of the students who likely would have attended were “encouraged” not to by their parents.
The administration is not supporting racism, but they are also not taking a stand against it. By allowing the proms to continue, they are only supporting, although passively, the discrimination the parents are espousing.
Perhaps if the administration and students both stood up for what is right, and a school-sponsored prom were held for several years in a row, it could replace the tradition of segregated proms that currently exists, giving students the push they needed to go against their parents’ outdated beliefs.
Heather Tomko (htomko@) would never go against Morgan Freeman.

For South Africa to produce the world’s next generation of engineers or doctors, extreme reform is in order. In fact, change is needed if the country even hopes for over 50 percent of its elementary school population to pass the “matric,” the main nationwide test at each grade level.
Currently, the public education system is stuck in the apartheid legacy in which the “Bantu” system was established to make blacks subservient laborers. This system not only plagues the students but also hurts today’s teachers, who were taught under the outdated system, making for a network of undereducated and unprepared South Africans.
Adding to the problem of outdated and repressive education, teacher absenteeism is at an all-time high. Teachers who fail to show up are not held accountable. Even when they do show up, they teach only for about half of the five hours they are expected to, spending the rest of the time immersed in paperwork. The knowledge they are imparting also brings up some doubts. In a study of literacy in third grade teachers, the majority of them scored less than 50 percent on a test for sixth graders.
With South Africa hoping to become a new, competitive global power, it is time for its public education system to reach the level of these grand hopes.
The new government after apartheid made a number of changes that they claimed would bring the education system up to par. Many of these changes, however, have been disastrous. In changing the curriculum, the government came up with a lesson plan far too sophisticated for current teachers. Many teacher colleges were shut down, and no programs or reforms were established in their place. In this illogical move, the government ensured that the network of uneducated South Africans remain in the midst of this new education system. South Africa has one of the world’s highest rates of teacher unionization. However, the emphasis is on teacher rights, not responsibilities, which needs to change.
Angie Motshekga, South Africa’s newly appointed Minister of Basic Education, has proposed some changes in the right direction. Motshekga has proposed that school principals be appointed directly by the education department, given more authority over teachers, and held accountable by the education department. She has also come up with a system of monitoring teacher attendance by having them respond to electronic queries.
However, Motshekga has shown that she is not willing to fully embrace radical reform. She has already been labeled as giving in to the demands of the South African Democratic Teachers’ Union. And though this proposal was scrapped, lowering the pass rate of the countrywide “matric” from an 80 percent to a 70 percent was at first seriously considered.
What is needed now in South Africa is a leader of education who is unafraid of complete departure from the apartheid public education system. It is true that the education department does not have much money to work with, but mass amounts of capital are not needed for reform. A change in mindset is needed in South Africa — a new age has dawned, and if South Africa aims to compete in the global economy, its reforms must be as determined as its hopes for change.

We learned this past week that Pittsburgh is not London. This April, the previous year’s G20 location saw several thousands of protesters along with a very violent police response that ultimately resulted in two deaths and a bank robbery that occurred during the ensuing chaos.
The police presence that Pittsburgh residents saw was much stronger and more forceful than it probably needed to be for the number of actual protesters — compared to gawkers, onlookers, and people with cameras (i.e. students) — who actually took part in the demonstrations and marches that were directed at world leaders.
The experience of walking around inside the security perimeter downtown was like starring in an end-of-the-world film, with the National Guard on every corner and tall steel barricades lining the streets. While several University of Pittsburgh students are still shouting about the injustices that occurred on their campus, we think it is likely both the protests and resulting police behavior will fade.
Pittsburgh — Sixburgh — has recently recovered from the riots after the Steelers won the Super Bowl in February. Once again, in response to the G20, crowds of people streamed through Oakland, causing inexplicable property damage in the forms of rocks being thrown at storefront windows due to people’s heightened emotional state and mob mentality.
While McDonald’s and Subway can certainly recover from a few smashed windows, local establishments like Pamela’s will find recovery a bit harder. This local Pittsburgh business, which actually received a lot of great press this week from leaders’ fantastic experiences with the pancakes, was unnecessarily targeted, undermining the whole point behind the protesters’ actions, which were supposedly demonstrations against big business.
It is certainly important for people in Pittsburgh and surrounding areas to come together and protest to take a stand for what they believe in, and we are glad to know that Pittsburghers have an opinion about something other than football. But just as we stated after the Steelers riots, breaking windows and causing other violence is not the correct way to show what you believe.
Carnegie Mellon carried itself incredibly well through this past week. Right off the heels of the Gates Hillman dedication, the university transformed itself into an efficient machine for dealing with Pittsburgh being in the spotlight on the world stage.
The university successfully and safely hosted both the richest man in the world and the prime minister of Australia, with the help, of course, of the large numbers of police and security officers that could be found in every corner of the campus. Police officers could also be seen being transported around Oakland in PAT buses marked as “special.”
There was a great deal of uncertainty and wild anticipation throughout the campus. Students and faculty alike lamented the late notice about building and road closings, with some professors even insisting at the beginning of last week that they would still be holding class, only to be undercut by official e-mails later. 
However, campus administration cannot be faulted, since they were likely awaiting information from government officials. Safety for both students and staff as well as the visiting world leaders had to be considered when making the closings, even if teachers would have preferred to keep teaching.
Road and building closings happened mostly as planned, and the campus generally maintained a level of sanity throughout Thursday and Friday as the various G20-related events were occurring downtown. While individual students likely took part in the protests, Carnegie Mellon as a whole was not associated with the rowdy nature of the crowds passing through Oakland and downtown. Instead, the campus maintained control over events at and around Carnegie Mellon.
While there was a pervasive campus sentiment of what’s-that-junk-on-the-fence, the art project that created a haven for education, discourse, and free speech was successful.
The project was actually approved beforehand by the administration, and was a unique way of speaking out against the G20 in a manner that could not be found elsewhere in the city.
However, it might have been nice to get more of the campus community involved, or at least aware of, the project’s intentions. If more students across multiple disciplines were involved in and made aware of the faux-tent city’s intentions and creation, the shantytown could have been taken a bit more seriously by the campus community as a whole.
Many students were unhappy with the project’s placement at the Fence, believing that that was not the appropriate place for the project and as students of a privately owned university, they should not have to see the demonstration on the campus. They were not in support of the message that the shantytown stood for and did not approve of the message being advertised at one of the campus’s most visible locations.
However, all appropriate steps were taken for those associated with the shantytown to take control of the Fence, and we are proud that Carnegie Mellon students found a peaceful, productive, and sanctioned way to question the G20.
With the White House already planning to demand nuclear inspections in Iran, progress was indeed made at the G20.
We aren’t so sure, however, that the limited time spent locked up in the Convention Center was the sole source of these developments. Our world leaders should continue to communicate regularly, with events like the G20 Summits acting as milestones to solidify the work that they’ve already been doing.
In terms of the lasting impacts of the G20 Summit, it is hard to say as of now what the outcome will be. It is too soon to see if any of the decisions made at the summit will be cemented and expanded upon in the future by the nations and leaders involved.
It is safe to say, however, that Pittsburgh’s reputation has risen in the eyes of many on the national and international stages.
Though it is unfortunate that the violence of the riots had to take precedence in the news over the good work that the city was doing during the Summit, the important leaders that visited surely noticed and appreciated the work that was put into the Summit.
