A quick peek at the more than 100 players listed on the Carnegie Mellon football team’s roster for 2010 shows a plethora of hometowns from across the nation, including six who are listed as hailing from good old Pittsburgh, Pa.
Pretty standard, right?
Not according to Head Coach Rich Lackner, who has been a part of Carnegie Mellon football since 1975. Lackner, a native Pittsburgher who played football for Mt. Lebanon High School, entered Carnegie Mellon as a first-year in 1975. In his experience as a player and as coach over the past 35 years, Lackner says the biggest difference is the players’ origins.
“I would say the biggest difference in terms of football coaching, I think, is the school itself,” Lackner said. “In the time that I was here, we were really an excellent university and we probably had more of a regional flavor.... Just looking as a football coach specifically, if there were 32 of us in the freshman class, probably 25 or 27 of us were from Pittsburgh or the surrounding areas. Now, you look at the roster and maybe five are from Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas, and the rest are from all over the place.”
It is because of this, Lackner explained, that recruiting has changed drastically over his tenure as coach. Originally, recruiting talent mainly involved looking within a local radius; nowadays, however, recruiting involves far more outreach and travel as it becomes a nationwide effort. Cell phones and the Internet, Lackner said, are two developments that have not only helped with recruiting, but also helped shape the process.
“Absolutely, you talk about two things that have really changed things, those are two of them,” Lackner said. “There are now also programs that help point students toward colleges in terms of both an athletic and academic standing, which have also helped. We’re in touch with a few of those as well.”
Lackner majored in history during his academic career,  completing an education degree while planning for a career as a high school history teacher and football coach. However, following his graduation from the university in 1979, a coaching position became open and Lackner was asked to stay with the team as an assistant. Lackner held his position until ascending to the head coaching position in 1986, the first year in which he worked with assistants Rich Erdelyi and Terry Bodnar. Erdelyi and Bodnar are still on Lackner’s staff as the three enter their 25th season as the core of Carnegie Mellon football.
When asked if he could name any particular Tartans squad as his favorite to coach, Coach Lackner’s eyes lit up.
“1990 and 2006,” he answered with a smile. “I wouldn’t necessarily call any seasons ‘favorites,’ but those, we enjoyed the most success in those two years. Obviously every year we’ve been blessed to have some great players and great leaders. But 1990 and 2006 especially were enjoyable because of the success we had.”
Both seasons saw Tartans football go undefeated through the regular season and clinch an NCAA Division III playoff spot.
“[In] 1990 we made it to the first round of the playoffs,” Lackner said, “but we traveled to Lycoming and lost there. [In] 2006 we beat Millsaps here [at Carnegie Mellon] in the first round and then got beat in the second round when we traveled to Wesley.”
Currently, 1990 and 2006 are the bookend years for Lackner’s five University Athletic Association Coach of the Year awards. He also won the award in 1991, 1993, and 1997. The year 2006 also saw Lackner named the All-South Region Coach of the Year.   
Lackner also commands high respect from his team. “Coach Lackner’s performance is second to none,” junior defensive lineman Andrew Medenbach said. “He has a firm dedication to his players on and off the field, and he is willing to sacrifice for us. I don’t know another head coach that will actually put themselves in the middle of a live drill in order to improve the players’ understanding of the game.”
When it comes to the development of Carnegie Mellon athletics over the past 35 years, Lackner had nothing but good things to say, especially about the past five years under current Athletics Director Susan Bassett.
“Susan definitely has the determination to put all Carnegie Mellon athletic teams in the best position to succeed,” Lackner said. “One of the huge developments she’s made has been the [Cost Varsity Weight Room] in Skibo Gym. Before that, the varsity weight room was a tiny room in the basement of Donner Hall, and the hot water pipe would drip right onto the squat machine.
“Another big thing that Susan has put into place is the new intramural field. I think it’s a great thing for intramural sports, for club sports, and for the soccer program.”
Lackner said that although the athletics department has had to make budget cuts over recent years, money has never really been an issue for the football team.
“Everyone has to make budget cuts,” Lackner said. “I’m not one to get jealous or anything and think that some other team’s getting more money than I am. No. I’ve never really felt like budget has been an issue. Yes, sometimes we have to tighten our belts, and I’ve felt the best way of addressing that is to tell the team exactly what’s going on.”
“Sometimes people don’t like that, and they take issue with it or whatever, but the reality is it has to happen,” Lackner added. “And it also is what happens in the real world. Sometimes payments don’t come through the way you want them to, and you have to stop spending on certain things.”
That is just one of the many ways that Lackner feels that being a student athlete helps a person develop and succeed both in and after college.
“You can use buzzwords like ‘leadership,’ ‘organization of time,’ ‘team player,’” Lackner said. “What also happens is that employers like to see that you played a varsity sport because it shows you can be in a team environment. You can work with others and you can deal with pressure, because you’ve been in situations before when that’s necessary because you dealt with it as a student athlete.”
It’s easy to see that Lackner embodies Carnegie Mellon athletics. He believes fully in the importance of the program from an academic, athletic, and individual standpoint and has devoted himself to improving an already successful football program in every way he can. As Lackner’s team takes the field this season, it’s hard not to be proud of the tradition and history that he has helped shape over the last 35 years, and to expect more success for many years to come.

Following the loss of eight starters from the 2009 season, there were some questions as to how Carnegie Mellon’s soccer program was planning on bouncing back. Now adding to the pressure is the task of following up on the most successful soccer season in university history. Head coach Arron Lujan is quite aware of the situation, and he and his staff have made sure that they are prepared for the upcoming season. 
Having lost 11 seniors overall, Lujan addressed the huge roster gap by bringing a whopping 12 first-years onto the team. The new class may be young, but the players are definitely ready to take on the challenge of making this season just as successful as the last. These new players have been recruited from all across the country to join one of the best NCAA Division III men’s soccer programs in the nation.
“We undoubtedly have a very good freshman class who are ready to fill in last year’s seniors’ shoes,” sophomore midfielder Ben Bryant said.
With that in mind, the returnees are just as eager to impress Lujan and will be vying for starting positions. “Players from last year that didn’t really have the chance to shine definitely have something to prove this year,” Bryant explained. “But obviously it will be tough as really everyone on this year’s roster has what it takes to be a starter.” 
Making it to the team was an accomplishment in and of itself, as Lujan had to drop a total of 11 players from the preseason roster, one of whom was a returnee who had been on the team for two years.
As opening kick off looms around the corner, the starting lineup is also beginning to shape up. The team will once again be playing a 4–3–3 formation, but the biggest question at this point is who will appear in the forward and center back positions. The team is ranked 11th in the nation according to the NSCAA/Adidas Division III preseason rankings, and Carnegie Mellon is picked to finish second in the University Athletic Association conference, despite losing the core of the team.
The Tartans’ first match of the season is this Wednesday against Washington and Jefferson College at 7:30 p.m. on the new soccer field.

Bid farewell to August, baseball fans. The time to officially rule your team in or out of the running starts this Wednesday. It’s time for contenders and spoilers alike to turn it up a notch, in what has become affectionately and aptly referred to as September baseball.
September baseball is when every game is significant in the standings for teams with playoff hopes. September baseball means not walking the leadoff man; it means hitting the cutoff man. It means taking advantage of your opponents’ mistakes and not missing any chances. Good September baseball is what teams want to play when the calendar flips past August. Good September baseball is what the Colorado Rockies played in 2007, when they won 11 straight as part of a 20–8 month to force an extra win in October that sent them to the playoffs. Good September baseball is what the Philadelphia Phillies played and what the New York Mets infamously did not play in 2007. Or 2008, for that matter.
In short, playing meaningful baseball in September means getting it done.
There is a long list of teams this year that will be looking to play good baseball in the regular season’s final month. While most signs point to the most meaningful baseball being played in the American League (AL) East, where the Yankees and the Rays are battling it out for first place, the truth of the matter is that barring a giant collapse, both teams will make it to the playoffs as they own the two best records in baseball. The Red Sox, on the other hand, are the ones hoping that they can somehow get on enough of a tear that once Wednesday comes, playing good September baseball will not even matter.
A tight AL Central race began in early August with the White Sox leading at 58–45, a half-game up on the 58–46 Twins. But August has not treated the White Sox well; not nearly as well as it has the Twins, who went on a tear and by Aug. 18 had already taken a commanding five-game lead over their rivals from the South Side of Chicago. Minnesota has begun to level out, though, and as Wednesday approaches, both teams will be looking to take their game to the next level knowing that a spot in October hangs in the balance. The Tigers, though, have completely fallen off the map. After leading the division at one point in July, Detroit entered Saturday’s action 11 games behind the Twins.
Well, at least they’re not the Indians.
In the AL West... Well, it really doesn’t matter how the Texas Rangers do in September. Texas entered Saturday as the only team in the division with a record above .500, 9.5 games up on the Athletics, and with MVP candidate Josh Hamilton leading the charge, it’d take a Mets-umental failure for the Rangers not to reach the playoffs.
The National League features many more teams putting the pedal to the metal come September, especially with the existence of an actual wild card race. (The Yanks and Rays pretty much ruin the term “race” in the AL.) While the Phillies lead the wild card by a half-game over the Giants entering Saturday’s action, Philadelphia finds itself a mere two games behind Atlanta for the NL East lead. The Florida Marlins will be looking, as usual, to reprise their role as spoiler as the Phils enter September looking for a four-peat as division champs, and the Braves head toward the finish line hoping to send manager Bobby Cox out with a bang.
The Reds, coming off of a bad 2009 season and a less-than-enviable start to 2010, have stormed back to take charge of the NL Central. While the Cardinals continue to put up a fight, Joey Votto and the Reds have overall played much better and more consistent baseball over the past few months, and I don’t see them fading enough to lose their division lead when the heat gets turned up. Look for the Brewers and Astros to play spoilers this month, as the Cubs have disappointed everyone this year and the Pirates are too focused on making sure the Orioles don’t try to steal back the worst record in baseball.
I’m glad I didn’t put money down on my prediction that the Padres would be the chumps of the NL West, as their stellar pitching, timely hitting, and defense have catapulted this team into a perch high atop the division. The Giants, while still close enough to make it a battle for the top spot, should focus more on their standing in the wild card race, where they sit in second, right on the heels of Philadelphia. The Dodgers can also make a push for the wild card if they string together enough consistently good September baseball; otherwise, their chances will be just as low as their division hopes already are.
Good September baseball or Mets September baseball aside, I expect to see a very West-ful World Series that will feature division champs Texas and San Diego. There’s no way to slow down the Rangers’ hitting or the Padres’ pitching, which is why I say mark my words now: Texas in six.

Have you ever had a really tough decision to make? Maybe you just couldn’t decide what internship to take over the summer or even just what to eat for dinner tonight. Well, a man named LeBron James had a huge decision this summer, and as you all know, it is the most talked-about “decision” in recent basketball history. If you live under a rock, LeBron James, former member of the NBA’s Cleveland Cavaliers, was the most talked-about free agent in the history of the NBA. Teams had been waiting for this summer just because they had the chance to sign this talent that many have compared to the likes of Michael Jordan. Naturally, every team’s fans had been looking forward to it too.
People around the world watched as on July 8, the self-proclaimed “King James” held an hour-long special to announce “The Decision” on ESPN. The proceeds of this hour-long special went to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, but this was merely a shadow of what James really wanted to do. We all know that James can donate as much money as he wants to any charity he wants. So, why did he have this hour-long special? Twenty-nine minutes into the special, the king finally announced his decision. “I have decided that I will be bringing my talents to South Beach [Miami],” James said, and then the riots began.
The reactions to the decision were huge. All across Cleveland, James jerseys were being used as firewood for street-side bonfires. When reporters showed James the scene going on in Cleveland, he responded with one of the most shocking statements he could come up with. “I give them permission to be mad right now,” he stated. The reactions were not limited to Cleveland Cavaliers fans, however. All-time greats like Charles Barkley and Magic Johnson claimed that they would never have done what James did, labeling him a backstabber in the process.
Probably one of the best reactions to the decision came from Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert. Throughout James’ years in Cleveland, Gilbert was much maligned because it was thought that he pampered James, so much so that the star player had no respect for Gilbert as a person. After the decision, Gilbert released a statement, written in Comic Sans, proclaiming that the Cavs would win a championship before the Heat and insinuating that James is coward and a backstabber.
He also accused James of quitting during the playoffs, especially in the final games against the Boston Celtics. Although this letter is immature and purely irrational, Gilbert does have a point. Any NBA fan can tell you that James’ performance in games five and six of the Eastern Conference finals was lackluster, to be generous. We know now that he was just tanking the playoffs in order to end the season quickly, so he could move on to the free agency summer and start planning where he would go next.
One of James’ greatest goals has been to become a global icon as the best player in the NBA. He currently sports the number 6 on his jersey, which he recently changed from Jordan’s old number, 23. Lebron says he did this “out of respect” for the all-time great, but his plan is clear. He wants to make his number the new icon, the new number that everyone knows. However, as he plays on the Miami Heat, he will never achieve this. Choosing the Heat does allow him one of the best chances to win, but the Heat always won their championships with the team on their backs. James can basically just sit back and relax and be called upon when needed in Miami. The Heat will always be considered Dwyane Wade’s team, and nothing James does can change that.
So what is to come of this decision? Obviously, the Heat is in prime position to win the title. However, will the team be able to do it? Many players across the league say that this really is not a big deal, as the Heat only has three star players and no other impact players. The Heat will be playing with a target on its back all year round, especially the egotistical “king.” A date to circle on your calendar is Dec. 2, as that is when the Heat visits Cleveland for the first time since this summer. Expect tons of well-deserved ridiculing, heckling, and profanity from the fans in Cleveland.

Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science has recently entered a five-year agreement with the National Science Foundation (NSF) in order to develop tools and methods for identifying and diagnosing behavioral disorders, including autism.
Every year, the NSF awards expedition grants to groups around the country for research. Carnegie Mellon was chosen as one of three major groups that would conduct research over the course of the year. The university joined a $10 million initiative headed by the Georgia Institute of Technology that uses computers to study behavioral disorders, according to an article by Medical News Today.
Autism, one of the most infamous of neural development disorders, is particularly crippling in that it often develops before the child is three years old. Recent research, however, suggests that certain behavioral science applications can be used to help prevent childhood autism before it enters its more mature forms.
Anind Dey, an associate professor in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute within the School of Computer Science, spoke of using behavioral imaging technologies to help with diagnoses. “Our ultimate goal is to diagnose autism as quickly as possible,” said Dey. Much like how medical imaging technology can identify problems within the body, these behavioral imaging technologies can tell scientists how infants are interacting with the world around them. One of the largest current problems with autism is that a diagnosis cannot be provided until the child is much older, when the stages of autism are most mature. Interactive and audio tools can determine whether there needs to be intervention at a young age. “These technologies are useful for parents, caregivers, as well as clinics,” Dey said.
Playing with toys, for example, can be a potential indicator of autism. If a child is engaging with a stuffed animal, for example, it’s a positive sign. If a child plays with only certain stuffed animals, however, it might be a warning sign. Dey noted, however, that these signs are not a definite indication of autism.
An ongoing part of autism research that Carnegie Mellon wishes to explore is the use of wearable sensors. Tested by a number of studies already, the goal of these sensors is to answer the question, “How much social interaction is this child having?” These sensors would detect telltale signs of autism, such as repeated motions and repeated behaviors. Again, it must be kept in mind that these are not definite indications of the disease. The motion sensors, using accelerometer technology, would be placed on the parts of the body most likely to move. Other sensors, such as video and audio sensors, could be put in toys that the child plays with.
Dey also talked about using home videos in order to identify the warning signs. One of the drawbacks of computer vision studies are that they are often done in a “pristine” environment, where certain background variables are not taken into account. Georgia Tech professor Jim Rehd wishes to work around this obstacle by using computer algorithms with home videos, where the child can be observed in a more natural environment. Though this form of observation is not as accurate as the clinical studies, it has the added benefit of not intruding too heavily on the lives of the child and family.

Imagine the Earth as a much colder planet. One could walk outside and watch his or her breath freeze upon contact with the open air. There would be no trees; even if there were, no animals would be playing in them. In fact, there would be very little of anything out there. Life, as it is today, would have actually ceased to exist. This would be our planet without the greenhouse effect.
The greenhouse effect is responsible for maintaining temperatures suitable for sustaining life. With it, the average temperature of Earth is around 60°F. Without it, the Earth would have an average temperature of about 0°F, resulting in a world as frigid as the one described above. This means that nearly 60 degrees Fahrenheit are attributed to this process. What exactly is going on here?
As the Earth’s main energy source, the sun emits energy in the form of visible light, and that energy is converted to heat at the surface of the Earth. According to the University Corporation of Atmospheric Research, the Earth must maintain a heat balance with outer space by emitting heat back into space in the form of infrared radiation that is invisible to the human eye. With no atmosphere and no absorbing “greenhouse gases,” this radiation would be lost to outer space and no heat would be retained. However, this is not the case, because greenhouse gases absorb this radiation and re-emit it in all directions — some continuing on to outer space and some back towards Earth. Essentially, it’s an atmospheric tennis match, and radiation is the ball.
One common myth you may have heard is that Earth’s temperature is “just right” because its orbit falls at a perfect distance from the sun. This is only part of the story, and as you may have guessed, it depends heavily on the constituents of our atmosphere and the strength of the greenhouse effect. For example, consider our two closest cosmic neighbors, Venus and Mars. The American Institute of Physics explains that Venus has a very thick and heavy atmosphere consisting mostly of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and water vapor — three greenhouse gases. As a result, its surface temperature is over 800°F, which is even hotter than Mercury’s surface temperature, even though Mercury is closer to the sun. In contrast, Mars has a very thin atmosphere and therefore a very weak greenhouse effect, resulting in a surface temperature of around –80°F.
The details of how greenhouse gases work are more complicated. Some greenhouse gases absorb radiation more than others; it all depends on the compatibility of the radiation and the gas. Infrared radiation emitted from the Earth has a spectrum of different wavelengths, a property that determines the types of interactions the light can have with different types of matter. (We perceive different wavelengths of visible light in the form of colors.) For example, if radiation of a given wavelength will increase the energy of a gas molecule, the gas molecule will absorb the radiation. In other words, a gas molecule will only absorb radiation if it is favorable, in terms of energy, to do so. The majority of Earth-emitted infrared radiation falls between 4 and 40 micrometers in wavelength, so any gas molecule that is able to achieve an increase in energy from absorbing any of these wavelengths is considered a greenhouse gas.
Currently, there is much scientific research being conducted to figure out to what extent humans are altering the Earth’s temperature by adding large amounts of greenhouse gases to our atmosphere. Despite the possible harsh implications of this so-called “enhanced greenhouse effect,” one must note how important a natural greenhouse effect here on Earth is to sustaining life as we know it.

Muscle memory is something that probably everyone takes for granted, but rightly so — it is an unconscious effort to remember how to perform tasks that have been repeated multiple times. 
The classic example of muscle memory is remembering how to ride a bike, but simpler, everyday tasks also involve muscle memory: typing, writing, throwing a ball, or brushing teeth.
A newborn cannot do much, and if we did not possess the ability to learn specific motor tasks through muscle memory, we would constantly have to relearn muscle movements. Consequently, muscle memory is an evolutionary survival mechanism that allows us to move effectively and use tools.
Although scientists know that the cerebellum is involved in motor learning, the mechanism of muscle memory is not exactly known. According to an article in Nature, one theory breaks down muscle memory into two stages: an encoding stage and a memory consolidation stage.
The encoding stage is when the muscle movement is being learned and the memory is “unstable,” or easily changed. When learning a new muscle movement, many areas of the brain become active because additional attention is required to focus on, and “proofread”, the task. When we try to learn how to write with our non-dominant hand, it seems to require a frustrating amount of attention as compared to writing with our dominant hand; this is the encoding stage of muscle memory.
The consolidation stage allows the movement to be stored in long-term memory and stabilizes the movement in memory. It is believed that repetitive firing of neurons in the brain can change how they are connected as well as increase their efficiency. As we become more familiar with the movement, connections that the brain made for proofreading the movement are diminished, so it seemingly becomes more natural.
By studying certain disorders, researchers can try to learn more about the basis of muscle memory. In a study published by The Journals of Gerontology, it was shown that patients with Alzheimer’s disease can learn a task — in this case throwing a bean bag at a target — when learning was performed regularly. Because researchers know which areas of the brain are affected by Alzheimer’s disease, they can narrow down the ways in which motor skills are memorized.
Another case study, famous to all cognitive psychology students, is that of Clive Wearing, who was unable to make any new memories or recall old ones due to brain damage. Although his memory was severely hampered, he was still able to walk and even play the piano. Researchers suggest that memories are easy to destroy because they are stored as one instance. Conversely, muscle movement and other procedural skills are repeated multiple times, and therefore scattered throughout the brain, making them harder to destroy.
The term muscle memory is sometimes attributed to a phenomenon that bodybuilders attest to. They find that it is easier to build muscle after a long break than when they first started to train their muscles. While it is not known whether or not this is a real phenomenon, studies are being performed on muscle cells and their components and seem to show that it actually exists.
Muscle memory is a way that our bodies learn to interact with the environment effectively. The next time you find yourself at a computer, typing every word without a second thought, or at a desk writing effortlessly, think about muscle memory.

Scientists find planet similar to Earth
Using NASA’s Kepler satellite, scientists may have discovered a planet with a diameter that is 1.5 times that of Earth. Scientists are still not completely sure if the object discovered is truly a planet and are in the process of confirming this. According to the study, published in the journal Science, the planet is located 2,000 light years away. If the planet is made up of materials similar to those of Earth, its mass should be around three to four times that of Earth.
The Kepler mission was started in March 2009 with the intention of finding Earth-like planets that might sustain life. Previously, gas-like planets the size of Saturn were also discovered with the Kepler satellite. This instance, however, is the first time that scientists working on the Kepler mission have discovered a planet with a size similar to Earth. The instruments in the Kepler mission are capable of measuring the size and distance of the planet, but are not capable of analyzing the atmospheric or geological conditions of the planet. Therefore, scientists still cannot be sure if the planet has conditions that could sustain life.

Researchers discern adenovirus structure
Scientists at the Scripps Research Institute have discovered the structure of the human adenovirus, which causes a number of respiratory, eye, and gastrointestinal diseases. To date, this is the largest virus whose structure has been determined using X-ray crystallography. The adenovirus is twice as large as the PRD1 virus, which was previously the largest viral structure to be discovered.
The adenovirus has been used in a number of gene-therapy trials as a vector or carrier. In such trials, the gene of interest was inserted into the genome of the virus, and this modified virus was then allowed to infect the host. Such gene therapy methods were used for diseases like cystic fibrosis but led to a number of complications, as scientists did not understand the exact structure of the virus at that time. With this new discovery, scientists have found major aspects of the assembly of the virus that could help in future gene therapy treatments.

Medicare helps smokers quit habit
Medicare will now cover up to eight counseling sessions per year for smokers who want to quit the habit. Starting next year, all such counseling sessions for smokers will be free. According to Medicare’s chief medical officer, Barry Straube, smokers can respond to counseling sessions and quit smoking even after 30 or more years of smoking.
Illnesses due to smoking are estimated to cost Medicare around $800 billion from 1995 to 2015. Previously, counseling for those suffering from smoking-related illnesses and drugs to help quit smoking were covered with Medicare. Until now, however, counseling to help quit smoking was not covered.

As Carnegie Mellon students, it’s no understatement to say that we get overwhelmed at times. Whether it’s school work, clubs and activities, or just trying to fit a little fun into our busy schedules, students at this school tend to get stressed out. Interestingly enough, Carnegie Mellon students can get pretty creative when finding ways to deal with stress. 
For some, stress relief can be as simple as biting one’s nails, chewing bubblegum, or maybe just closing e-mail and textbooks to pig out on the couch for an hour and watch some television. While these tend to be some of the easiest ways to relax, some students have found more creative methods, like cooking, painting, or even dancing. 
For those of you who have yet to pick your specific stress relief activity, try choosing something that can actually be beneficial for you, whether it helps you practice a skill, save time on another activity, or generally make you happy. Exercise can actually be a great way to relieve stress — for students who choose not to participate in team sports, it can be a great way to incorporate a workout into their study-oriented schedules. 
The Carnegie Mellon campus and Pittsburgh community have plenty of resources to help us work our bodies and relieve our minds. Whether you prefer to be out and about in the city or in the comfort of an air conditioned room, there is certainly something for you. With all of the available options, however, the key is merely finding the one that works best for you. 
Club sports
There are several positive aspects of joining a team sport. First, being on a club team means that you are allowed to organize your own schedule and practice times. If you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed with work on a certain week, you won’t be reprimanded for missing practice. Furthermore, joining a club sport allows you to incorporate social time into your stress relief. While the exercise in general is a great break for your overworked brain, you will also get the chance to meet new people and get your social fix during practice times. 
Indoor activities
If you’re in favor of a more traditional workout, the Carnegie Mellon campus has several resources for you. For some, the most relaxing time of the day involves sweating on an elliptical machine while listening to a favorite song on an iPod. Carnegie Mellon has several indoor training areas including the Cost Varsity Weight Room, Skibo Gym, and various University Center facilities.
For those who are bored by the idea of indoor cardio workouts or weight training, fear not. Many students choose to spice up their workouts by taking advantage of the various facilities on campus and equipment that is accessible from the Issue Desk in the UC. From tennis and racquetball courts to basketball in Wiegand or something as simple as a football or Frisbee; the Issue Desk has it and, best of all, it’s all free for Carnegie Mellon students. 
Students can even turn their stress relief workout into a group activity by organizing a couple of friends and reserving a tennis court, or getting a group together to use the indoor pool. If you haven’t yet seen the whirlpool and steam room facilities within the University Center locker rooms, be sure and visit. You’d be surprised at how relaxing they can be. 
Exercise classes 
If you have the time, joining a university-taught gym course could be the perfect stress relief for you. The university offers a large variety of classes, including kickboxing, yoga, dance, pilates, and cycling. The best part about joining a university-taught course, besides being able to do it with a group of friends for no additional cost to your tuition, is the attention and guidance you get from the professionals teaching the course.
Atypical exploration
Outside of the Carnegie Mellon campus bubble, there are plenty of activities around the city that incorporate exercise with stress relief. If you’re feeling a little campus-claustrophobic, why don’t you organize a group to go hiking in the Laurel Highlands or in Oil Creek State Park? If you’d like to spend some time on the water, you can go kayaking, canoeing, rowing, and sailing at various locations around Pittsburgh. These activities allow you to see several places in and around Pittsburgh that you might not have seen otherwise and show off the beautiful Pennsylvania landscape. Don’t forget to bring your camera.
If you’d prefer to do these activities with a group of people, the Carnegie Mellon Explorers Club hosts several activities throughout the school year including skydiving, kayaking, white-water rafting, and more. 
Parks and recreation
Lucky for us, by living in Pittsburgh we’re never far from one of our city’s many giant, grassy, tree-covered parks. For those students coming from non-urban environments, a trip to the park is like escaping the sometimes intimidating city environment. 
Organizing a gathering of friends to go ice skating in Schenley Park or to play a game of Frisbee or golf could be a fun and fit way to relieve stress. Try gathering some friends together and organizing a biking trip to explore all of the parks within the Oakland area. 
Exercise is just one component of stress relief. Though you’ve probably heard it a thousand times, eating healthily and getting to sleep at a reasonable hour are beneficial to maintaining your sanity.  For all the first-years, it may be that your friend at another university is able to party every night and maintain his or her academic and relaxation levels; however, it’s important to realize that you are at Carnegie Mellon. Because we are part of a campus community that focuses so intently on academics, the experience is different and you may find yourself making compromises. The sooner you are able to realize this, the sooner you will be able to find the schedule that fits your needs.
If you do choose exercise as a means of stress relief, the best way to find what works for you is to simply try everything. Chances are, by doing everything, you’ll not only have a fabulous time, but you’ll help your body stay fit and keep your mind stress-free.

Gorgeous tickets printed, posters in the hallways, seats filling the belly of Rangos, and a sprawling line, composed mainly of uber-hipsters, snaking through the UC signaled the first AB Coffeehouse event of the year: The Books, with special guest Lohio.
Lohio, in classic we-need-to-find-a-local-band-to-open fashion, is a Pittsburgh-based group that played well and sang well, filling the first hour of the show with music that did not send people fleeing in droves. They were pleasant and, in their own right, good. However, they were no match for the semi-spectacle that is The Books.
The Books began with a track called “Group Autogenics.” Autogenics, a technique for relaxation invented in 1932, has a participant repeat a series of sayings to, as www.guidetopsychology.com states, “add a calm, stabilizing sensation of coolness to your forehead.”  The Books have taken autogenics recordings; added a beat, a bit of cello, and a bit of clavinet; and projected those slow, calm voices above the band, emanating from floating heads. Disembodied heads and hands, and glasses of what might be liquid earwax, poured onscreen, all superimposed on swirling, vibrantly colored, fractal-infused backgrounds. That is The Books.
The two bandmates, Nick Zammuto and Paul de Jong, who have been creating music in this manner for over a decade, have continued to refine their approach with their newest release The Way Out. Their self-described style of collage music is created from vast catalogues — that they themselves have assembled — of obscure and often old recordings. This lends a layered, often humorous texture to the music: The relaxing mantras described above are recited on top of the sounds of Japanese airline attendants, bird whistles, and kids screaming about ripping out each other’s hair.
But since, so often, the best qualities of the music are from the carefully formulated layers of the collected recordings and their added instrumentation, what is the value of the live performance? Much of the material is pre-recorded, because it began its life as a cassette tape or a discarded record, and the music cannot stray far from its studio version and still aligns with the video experience. 
So the value of the concert (having witnessed this uncommon performance) is not in The Books’ improvisations or their sheer live musical skill, but in the genius of the assembly. They have created a concert experience that is nearly unique, one where friends can sit down, in every seat and then on the floor of Rangos, to absorb this thoughtfully created audio-visual experience, to enjoy the humor, the obscurity, and the intrigue.

Summer brings sunshine, heat, and long days. The defining attributes of summer vary with location. The Beach Boys personify the West Coast, as their music oozes surfing, blonde hair, dancing, and beautiful women. The cowboy’s night of pleasure describes The Southwest, much as the ever-classic blues personifies the rural south. There is a definite atmosphere that each of us associates with the summertime. Let’s take a look at a variety of albums that ooze summer.
The most recent phenomenon is the West Coast music of Best Coast’s Crazy For You. While not a fantastic album, Crazy For You has all the tropes of the Beach Boys. The album is low-fi surf pop released at the peak of its seasonal popularity. The hype surrounding the album leads to disappointment, as nearly every song sounds similar. 
Despite its setbacks, Crazy For You defines a day at the beach. The album is a solid freshman debut. While the lyrics aren’t horrible, they lean heavily on the boyfriend/love-interest topic. Songwriter and frontwoman Bethany Cosentino will surely be a voice to look for in the near future.
Bob Wills is the king of western swing. Most readers probably haven’t heard of Wills or western swing. Wills’ music defines 20 years (1935–1955) of pop music in the Southwest. Recently released are the Tiffany Transcriptions, the eight-disc collection of live performances of Wills and company. The songs come from a different era (recorded in 1946), but the lyrics and accompanying music are endearing to both heart and soul. 
The Tiffany Transcriptions are a collection of songs that embody the history of the Southwest. The genre’s simple beats, fascinating guitar and fiddle, and memorable lyrics were the dance music for an entire geographic region.  
Wilco’s Sky Blue Sky embodies the diverse attributes of the South. The album contains so much more than its moniker of “dad-rock.” The addition of Nels Cline’s guitar filled the void left behind after Jay Bennett’s departure. Lead singer Jeff Tweedy’s lyrics are at times quite personal, speaking of lost love and loneliness.  
Cline and Tweed feature colorful and expansive guitar work on Sky Blue Sky, a combination perfect for listening to in the sunlight. While Sky Blue Sky is not Wilco’s best album, it remains timeless. The album captures the mood of the summer countryside in 12 expansive tracks.
Animal Collective’s Strawberry Jam is a recent phenomenon — as is the Flaming Lips’ Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. While it’s clear that the summer cannot be described by a couple of contemporary albums, there are detectable trends. This summer’s most popular albums are light-hearted affairs, reflecting the fleeting nature of summer encounters and experiences. While each geographic region is different, technology and the concept of universal music are connecting and blending the differences.

Cooler days, colored leaves, and the start of a new school year all mark the changing of the seasons, but nothing quite says “autumn” like the annual foot-thick September fashion issue.  
This two-ton Bible of the fashion world comes out once a year, and whether you subscribe to Vogue, Marie Claire, or Harper’s Bazaar, five bucks will get you page after glossy page of style inspiration. However, because its hefty size can be a bit intimidating, here is your own personal field guide to fall fashion, created especially for those who want the low-down on the new season’s styles without the pain of one of those venerable tomes ripping a hole in your Rite Aid shopping bag. 
Camel coats
This staple of 2010 fall fashion is not made from camel, nor does it make the wearer resemble one.  However, its lovely warm beige color is so reminiscent of humped quadrupeds that the animal is rightfully its namesake. This item has been splashed over the centerfold of so many magazines that no self-respecting fashion publication lacks one or two of these tucked within its pages.  
The camel coat is a good key piece for a look that takes full advantage of this season’s neutrals theme. Pair with khakis and olive greens for one of the most prominent combinations of this fall.  
Satchels
As practical as they may be, the average Jansport resembles a hobo’s sack on a stick next to this season’s leather satchel.  Whether small enough to serve as a purse or as a useful carry-all, the structured leather satchel helps create a polished fall look in a variety of colors.  
Hiker boots
Remember your good ol’ Timberlands? Picture those, but with formidable three-inch heels, and there you have this year’s essential fall shoe. Rugged leather and laces together with a sharp heel and peep toe, this marriage of opposites has made its way onto multiple runways. Paired with thick woolen socks or colorful tights, you can rock these boots with dresses or jeans. I hear they work well on sheer cliffs too.  
Purple
One of this season’s most defining colors is purple, appearing on eyelids, lips, and nails. The right shade, however, is key. Applying a color too warm to your eyes may cause you to resemble Rocky after fifteen rounds with Apollo. Too dark and the shade will look too brown. Aim for a cool lavender or dark mauve and you’ll knock ’em dead. 
Army jacket
The only thing I remember about Freaks and Geeks apart from James Franco is Lindsay’s perfect army jacket. Years later, this emblem of freak status has now hit the runways as the perfect casual jacket for fall. Lightweight, but thick enough to stand the early autumn chill, this fall staple can pull together a whole outfit. Don’t be intimidated by its bulky appearance — those who are brave enough to rock this rugged look, I salute you.  
Faux fur
One of the most memorable runway images this fall was undoubtedly Chanel’s fur-covered pieces. Shaggy faux fur is both chic and cozy, so be sure to snag a bit of the fuzzy goodness at the first opportunity. And since wool-lined aviators, faux fur vests, and shaggy jackets line pretty much every store window, rest assured that there will be many opportunities.  However, it’s important to be able to distinguish the line between “couture faux fur” and “crazy mountain man covered in coons.” Know this line and respect it, please.  
All of these pieces are key items for nailing the perfect fall look. There are of course many, many more, as countless September issues will tell you, and you should always feel confident in setting some new trends yourself. Use this guide to rock the main iconic images of fall 2010, whether in a Michael Kors camel coat or a pair of Aldo’s high-heeled hikers.

For the past couple of decades, there has been a lot of talk about change — many people have proposed adapting our habits as human beings and inhabitants of Earth to decrease the ecological taxation on our planet, thus extending the planet’s seemingly diminishing life span. While talking, planning, and proposing are necessary beginning steps when approaching a subject as openly disputed as ecological restructuring and consciousness, the amount of definite action remains limited. 
These days, being “eco-friendly” has become sort of a social norm — much like being politically correct or dressed in public. It has become the sort of characteristic that we expect from one another, and we are shocked when someone chooses to openly disregard it. While it is true that many organizations and specific individuals have made tremendous strides in green practices and technology, for the majority of people being green remains a back-burner idea — only acknowledged and practiced when it is convenient for the individual. 
The question remains: What kind of life-altering, tragic event will have to occur to convince people that adapting our lives to save our environment should be at the forefront of our minds? Instead of imagining the end of our world as we know it and the chaos that will ensue, we can attempt to increase awareness of ecological issues in our own society. The chances are that wherever you are, your community offers a plethora of eco-friendly green alternatives in consumerism, transportation, and more. Here at Carnegie Mellon, some student organizations have brought more environmentally friendly options to campus, even if you haven’t been looking for them.
**Shopping **
Within the first couple of weeks, when preparing for the school year, there are plenty of environmentally friendly options to choose from when stocking your apartment fridge or hitting up the bookstore for school supplies. Entropy+, for example, sells several products that stress sustainability. From delicious soy ice cream to recycled-packaging snack foods to free-range meats, if you know what to look for you can find it at Entropy+. 
Carnegie Mellon has also introduced several eco-friendly options within the campus bookstore. Recycled three-ring binders, notebooks, and paper products, and even pens made from recycled water bottles, can all be found among the bookstore shelves. With no noticeable difference between non-recycled and recycled products, why wouldn’t you buy green?
** Transportation **
Sure, when you first heard about the Carnegie Mellon campus shuttle service during Orientation, you thought, “Gee, that’s convenient,” but this service offers more than just door-to-door transportation. Many students who choose to live off-campus bring cars and use them on a daily basis to commute to school. If you know someone like this, try suggesting that he or she take advantage of the shuttle service or the Port Authority buses to save money on gas while simultaneously saving the environment. 
It is also extremely hard to find a location on campus where there aren’t bike racks. If you’re worried about being late for class, or are just too tired to walk, invest in a bike and helmet to ease your commute. Many upperclassmen who live out of state choose to sell their bikes at the end of the school year, so if you’re looking for a cheap and sustainable way to get your hands on a bike, be sure to ask around. 
** Disposal **
Believe it or not, almost every residence hall on the Carnegie Mellon campus offers students an array of recycling and disposal options. Do you have a stack of cardboard boxes in your dorm from when you moved in? Break down your boxes and find the nearest recycling center. 
The best way to increase sustainability efforts is to discuss their importance with others and advertise opportunities for change. There is no better time than now to go green.

In this decade, it’s safe to say that many people interested in film production are able to appreciate the work of Christopher Nolan. Memento dazzled millions of moviegoers and confused even more; The Prestige romanticized the era of magicians in the late 1900s; and The Dark Knight made audiences love the villain even more than the hero. With his most recent release, Nolan has yet again created a masterpiece that tops all predecessors. While there were predictable summer blockbusters (like Iron Man 2 and the latest installment of the Twilight saga, Eclipse), nothing drew as much critical acclaim as Nolan’s latest psychological adventure, Inception. 
At the beginning of the movie, audiences meet Cobb and Arthur, a duo that conducts “extractions” — procedures that involve invading someone’s dreams and stealing secrets. The pair is soon introduced to a wealthy businessman named Saito, who wants them to perform “inception” — a process that focuses on planting information rather than stealing it. Saito wants to invade the mind of Robert Fischer, a wealthy heir, and implant the idea to destroy his father’s company, which is on the verge of complete global monopolization. Immediately, Arthur says it’s dangerous and nearly impossible, but Cobb ignores the risk and promises he can deliver.
The three men put together a team for the job. They gain Eames, who can take on the physical form of anyone else while in a dream. They also get Ariadne, played by Ellen Page, an architect studying under Cobb’s grandfather (played by the always delightful Michael Caine, whose appearance in the movie is much too limited). It’s Ariadne’s job to design the layers of Fischer’s dream, into which the team will enter. Also on the job is Yusuf, a chemist who produces a sedative powerful enough that the team can experience their van tumbling five times over without waking from their sleep.
The crew goes through dreams within dreams where the stakes are raised each time, and all the while, Cobb is hiding a graveyard of the undead inside of him. He has personal issues for days, but he keeps it inside so as not to affect the team’s missions. His wife Mal likes to show up when she’s not needed, and this eventually becomes a hindrance to the team. Her villainous antagonism makes her someone we love to hate, but her love for Cobb is so pure, we gain a soft spot for her.
The movie is just about two and a half hours long, and every minute is enjoyable. From the opening scene of Cobb washing ashore in a unknown place to the closing scene (no spoilers here, but it’ll leave you with your jaw dropped and your mind’s gears still turning), the plot of Inception truly packs a punch. The movie will take your mind into a whole other dimension, and that’s the power behind the film: It’s so easy to get sucked into the world you’re watching. There are so many blurs between reality and dreams, even Cobb tells Ariadne, “Dreams feel real while we’re in them. It’s only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.”
And as real as Nolan paints the dreams to be, he still stresses how you can “cheat” reality while within them.  When Ariadne begins her initial dream design, she’s walking along the streets of Paris when the roads in front of her fold over and become the ceiling of the city. Another hypnotizing scene involves a fight scene in a hotel hallway. Doesn’t sound too unique? Let’s then add that there’s no gravity, so floor becomes ceiling, up becomes down, and your senses are taken on a whirlwind of adventure. Throughout the movie, when the crew is in a dream, strange things like time slowing down or gravity shifting provide for absolutely mesmerizing scenes.
Despite being such a fresh concept, Inception was actually birthed almost a decade ago, when Nolan wrote an 80-page proposal to Warner Bros. about stealing dreams. The ideas were all there, but his vision for the film needed to keep growing. So, instead of starting production on the project, Nolan took up Batman Begin and The Dark Knight for more experience with large-scale, big-budget films. After the success of these two movies, Nolan polished up the script, convinced Leonardo DiCaprio to star, and began filming this gem.
Commercially, Inception has been very successful. It’s made over $263 million in the States, which is impressive, but comparatively The Dark Knight took in $533 domestically. Worldwide, Inception has collected over $620 million and as of now is the fifth-highest grossing movie of the year. Critical reception has been mostly positive: Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an impressive 87 percent fresh rating; IMDb ranked it as the fourth best movie of all time, just under The Shawshank Redemption, The Godfather, and The Godfather: Part II.
However, no film is completely loved by all. Common criticisms target the film’s extensive length, some call it “overcomplicated,” and some even say that it tries too hard to fool you. Regardless, if you’re going to see it for the first time: Sit back, relax, and enjoy the world that Nolan is going to drag you into.

Believe it or not, it’s been two years since Katy Perry released her debut album, One Of The Boys. Seems like it was just yesterday that she "kissed a girl" and "liked it" while the rest of us rushed to convenience stores to buy cherry chapstick. Despite the popularity of her first single "Ur So Gay" and the catchy song that made every girl want to kiss girls, critics speculated that Perry was only a temporary fixture in the pop world. Then, after "I Kissed A Girl" took over the radio, she released three more chart-topping singles:"Hot n Cold," "Thinking Of You," "Waking Up In Vegas" — and the RIAA certified her album platinum, proving she was here to stay.
Unfortunately, pop music tends to change its mind, loving an artist one day, and dumping it the next. Luckily, Perry is not one of those artists. It would seem as if Teenage Dream, her sophomore album, might be even more successful than her first. Perry already has two hit singles from the album; "California Gurls" which peaked at number one on Billboard Hot 100 and "Teenage Dream" which has so far reached number three. Both songs are certainly catchy, if nothing else. "California Gurls" might even be described as the token summer pop song, all bounce and fun, while "Teenage Dream" is more mature, comparing the feeling of being with a lover with that of being a teenager. Both songs appear near the beginning of the album, giving it a jump start that lasts maybe halfway through the album. Eventually, however, the energy fades out, maybe because of the similarity of all the songs.
The problem with Perry, despite all her success, is that she's kind of a one trick pony. Perhaps it's not much of a problem, since it seems to work out pretty well for her, but the act gets old. Teenage Dream is like one long, upbeat song, with a few tangents in between. Perry tries too hard to live up to the image she created, and ends up with some songs that border on vulgarity without the class that she tries so hard to portray. "Peacock," especially, is one such song that’s all pump and no content. Her message is not cleverly disguised, nor is the melody worth listening to, resulting in a song that sounds close to an explicit cheer. A more notable song is "The One That Got Away," a bittersweet number that reminisces about a lost love and what could have been. In "Pearl," Perry touches on the occurrence of a strong woman losing her spark when she enters into a relationship. She ends the album with "Not Like The Movies," a slow, idealistic song about waiting for the one. 
The pep is cute at best, but it will be hard to constantly rely on catchiness to make a career. Perhaps the only thing Teenage Dream has going for it is the ability to convince listeners to overlook its flaws and concentrate on the girly pop feel of the album.

Sitting on a plane heading to a completely foreign country should not be the first time you open a guidebook to read about that country. Yet here I was, heading to Cyprus for a month-long study abroad program opening my Lonely Planet guide for the first time. Cyprus, I learned, was currently divided into two halves, one with Greek Cypriots and the other with Turkish Cypriots. The Republic of Cyprus, where I was headed, was a part of the European Union and consisted mostly of Greek Cypriots. The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognized as a sovereign state only by Turkey, was home to most of the Turkish Cypriots. 
The United Nations had to intervene to make peace between the two sides and is currently occupying a buffer zone between them. As I sat on the plane with less than an hour to land, I realized I was entering a country that, until quite recently, had undergone considerable political strife and violence. Excellent.
When I first got to Nicosia, the capital of the island, all the apprehension I had built up during my plane ride disappeared immediately. The area around the University of Nicosia, where I was living, was a lazy, quiet sort of place, and the downtown area was filled with numerous places to eat and shop. The locals were warm and extremely helpful — my second day in Nicosia I had the owner of a small roadside eatery spend 15 minutes helping me decipher the Greek menu there. On the weekends, we went on trips to the tourist-packed beach resorts around the country. We went to the popular Ayia Napa region, one of the hottest European tourist destinations, often called the “Cancun of Europe”; to Paphos, an area famous for archeological ruins; and to Polis, where I had one of the best hiking experiences of my life. Although the weekends, with afternoons spent lazing on beaches and nights at bars watching the FIFA World Cup, were fun, I had some of the most memorable experiences of the trip in Nicosia. 
The last divided capital in the world, Nicosia had plenty of opportunities for me to get acquainted with the cultural and political side of the country. I went to numerous art shows and a jazz festival, and ate the traditional “meze,” a sampling of local delicacies. We even went to mass at a Greek orthodox church, which in spite of being completely in Greek and lasting for nearly three hours, was one of the most interesting experiences I had in Cyprus. During our last week in Cyprus, a group of fellow students and I decided to cross the border in Nicosia and visit the Turkish side of the city. 
The gateway at the border was decorated almost festively with balloons, streamers, and colorful signs promoting peace between the two sides. We simply showed our passports at the border, walked for a couple minutes, and were on the Turkish side. Contrary to all the fanciful images that my mind had concocted, the city on the other side of the border seemed no different from the one I had just left.  We walked among similar looking shops and for the longest time the only difference was that signs that had been in Greek were now in Turkish. When we ate and shopped, however, we were surprised (and quite pleased) to find that the Turkish side was considerably cheaper than the Greek side. We ate a large amount of food on the Turkish side and became especially fond of a dish we decided to name a cheese boat; all it consisted of was local cheese stuffed in boat-shaped pita bread, and it was delicious. 
As we walked back across the balloon-filled gateway at night and began to look for a taxi, we noticed an old woman following us. After nearly 10 minutes, we began to get worried and quickened our pace. That was when she called out to us and asked us stop. In broken English, she questioned where we had just come from. We tried walking away, but this woman was persistent. Finally, we told her we had just come back from the Turkish side and she then asked us what we were doing there. Nothing, we tried telling her, we were just tourists and were visiting the area. She shook her head and told us that we should never go there. She told us her house had been there and when the Turkish army had occupied the area she had to leave all her belongings behind and run. She had never been back since. What had been a completely normal day for us had suddenly transformed into something else. 
In my last week in Cyprus, the old woman had taught me that I knew very little, if anything, about the sentiments of the people there and the way they felt. To understand a country, you need to understand its people, and I barely touched the tip of the iceberg. One month, I now realize, is too short to be little more than a tourist in a foreign country. I hope to go back to Cyprus one day and truly understand the essence of the island.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I’ve been hanging out with this girl one-on-one for a while, and I really like her, but I’m not sure if we’re dating. We watch movies and sometimes go to Subway together, but does that mean we’re going out? What should I do?
Sincerely,
Not at ease with babes
Dear NEWB,
You need to convert this girl into your girlfriend. You have two options in front of you. The first is just to make a move. When you’re watching a movie together, just lean over and start kissing her. This can go one of two ways: tonsil hockey or sexual assault charges. Even worse, you could wind up with a long talk about your relationship and how you should be friends and stuff like that — a guy’s worst nightmare. That and prison rape, which could happen if those charges stick.
Option two is to ask her out on an actual date. Take her to a real restaurant. Subway doesn’t count. Chicks dig that sort of thing. Dress up a little bit. Avoid the d-word, that could scare her off. The worst that could happen is that she turns you down, and then you know that she’s not interested. If all goes well, this too could end in tonsil hockey.
Be sure to bring a mint,
Brian Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
This question is for Patrick. I read your column all last year and Facebook stalked you for a while. I’m totally in love with you. You’re gorgeous and your columns are funny and I love you. Will you go out with me?
Sincerely,
Not Patrick
Dear Not Me,
Why, thank you for this totally unasked-for question that I definitely didn’t write myself. Unfortunately, “The Hos” is something of a free agent — I don’t have a girlfriend, just someone who will be upset when she reads this. Plus, I have a policy of not dating my stalkers. It always ends with a little too much blood.
In all seriousness, I’m flattered, but not interested. You should try falling in love with people you actually know. Don’t stalk them, though — restraining orders are a huge hassle. You’ve read my columns, so you must be well-versed in my excellent love advice. Try following it. You’ll find someone who’s as interested in you as you are in him. Who knows, they may even be more gorgeous than I am. Unlikely.
Please stop stalking me,
Patrick Hoskins

Another fall semester underway, I found myself sitting on the Cut listening to the familiar electronic murmurings of Carnegie Mellon’s radio station, WRCT. The precocious synthetic hums of distortion were, as always, a little jarring for a sunny end-of-summer afternoon, but give those DJs credit: They know how to make their presence known. 
But unlike other years, WRCT had some serious competition in the form of SigEp. Having just taken the Fence, the men of SigEp were vying for control of the Cut. They brought out the biggest speakers they could find and immediately blasted their iPods at full volume. 
And I apologize, WRCT, but SigEp absolutely won me over. They flipped through genres with a healthy disregard for musical transition. First, a hip-hop-heavy anthem, then the alternative rock thrashings of classic ‘90s Red Hot Chili Peppers, and later the modern musings of the Gorillaz’s “Superfast Jellyfish.” 
SigEp didn’t play anything classical, but the diversity of their music was still terrific. Most of all, SigEp’s music was familiar — we all grew up with it. Students frequently walked by the Fence saying, “Do you remember this song?” and someone would immediately grin and say, “Of course, this was my song in high school.” 
Left and right, people jumped into the music and experienced their past. Whether it was from three days or three years ago, students remembered how much these songs meant to them. In the most wonderfully cliched sense, the music spoke to our generation.
And if you blinked, you might have missed it.

The Class< br/>
Thursday, Sept. 2< br/>
7:30 10 12:30< br/>< br/>
This 2008 French flick won the the Palme d’Or, the highest prize at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival. It is based on a novel by author François Bégaudeau, who also stars in the film as a language and literature teacher in Paris, mirroring Bégaudeau’s actual teaching experiences. The camera never leaves the school as it covers the entire academic year, focusing on the lives of the students only when in class. Bégaudeau faces difficulties in teaching his racially mixed Parisian students, many of whom come from tough backgrounds. Well-received by critics, the film ended up making five times its budget at the box office in France.
How to Train Your Dragon< br/>
Friday, Sept. 3< br/>
8 10 12< br/>< br/>
This fantasy tale about a boy, his dragon, and their adventures has grossed nearly a half a billion dollars at the box office. Hiccup, the son of a Viking chieftain, desperately wants to become a dragon slayer like so many of his fellow Vikings, but his small stature and physical weakness make him the butt of many jokes. Relying on his brain rather than brawn (sound familiar, Carnegie Mellon students?) he manages to knock a dragon unconscious, but instead of killing it he befriends it. Fun fact: Distributor Paramount Pictures was accused of bullying theater owners in trying to coerce them to screen this film, rather than competing ones, in 3-D.
Princess Bride < br/>
Saturday, Sept. 4< br/>
8 10 12< br/>< br/>
The Princess Bride is every type of awesome packed into 98 fun-filled minutes. Cary Elwes plays Westley, a servant boy turned hero who only wishes to live with his one true love, Buttercup. Told in a narrative style to preserve the book the film is based on, The Princess Bride is a fantastic tale. It’s funny, it’s romantic, it has splendid action, and it is one of the most quotable movies I’ve ever seen. To borrow from one of those lines, “I am an honest man; lies do not become me.” I’m not lying about this movie. Go see it and thank me later.
The Machinist< br/>
Sunday, Sept. 5< br/>
8 10 12< br/>< br/>
I must preface any description of this movie with the fact that Christian Bale is a deeply committed actor. In The Machinist, he plays Trevor Reznik, a machine worker at a factory who has had chronic insomnia for a year. A series of disturbing events begins to occur and eventually haunts him. Due to his insomnia, Trevor loses weight to the point of being severely emaciated. As the story begins to unravel, he uncovers a terrible secret about his own life. Fun fact: Bale literally starved himself to achieve his look in the film, going from 180 pounds to 120 pounds in a matter of four months by having just one cup of coffee and an apple each day.

This issue updates students on “the passing of some of our institution’s most able professors.” Thankfully, the four men listed didn’t die over the summer; they just moved on to other universities. If my jokes don’t get any better, someone will have to write about my own passing as a writer.

The U.S. presidential election of 1960 is approaching, and The Tartan makes note of a plea that faculty members avoid making statements about anything that could be significant on the ballot. Looks like Nixon predated his Watergate scandal with some Carnegie Mellon-based silencing attempts. .

Apparently, the wonderful “trucks” didn’t always line Margaret Morrison Street. They used to be on Tech Street outside Posner! Allegedly, Housing and Dining had no input on the decision. I smell something fishy, though, and it reeks just like Carnegie Mellon’s food did prior to CulinArt.

A Forum article notes that a recent graduate of Monroe College is suing her alma mater after she failed to find a job within four months after graduation. Perhaps it was this sharp business acumen that caused each of her potential employers to slam the door in her face.

Try not to be so negative this week; round yourself as close to zero as possible.
I hate bees. If you want to get ahead in life, you should too.
Walk right into the hornet’s nest this week — it can’t end that badly, right?
This week, don’t make a mountain out of a molehill. Make one out of an anthill; they are much easier to start from.
Don’t sweat the small stuff; obsess over it until you get every detail exactly right.
This week, try harder to be a nice person — you really suck at it right now.
Try not to let your devious side get the better of you. Pick the evil one instead.
Don’t be an enabler: Leave your alarm on in the morning so your roommate doesn’t sleep in past 6:30.
By removing all of your clothing at a pivotal moment, you can escape an embarrassing situation with a chicken and a model train.
The stars are not quite sure how you managed to get yourself into your current situation, but you can escape by moving three states west.
You can complain to the studio as much as you want; your favorite TV show as a kid is never going to be published in your obscure video format.
Let the wind guide you this week. Let it fill your sails, even if it guides your boat over a waterfall.

Public art is seemingly everywhere on Carnegie Mellon’s campus. Take a look at the iconic “Walking to the Sky,” a statue that has towered over the Cut in front of Warner Hall since May 2006, and surely one cannot forget the Kraus Campo that has adorned the roof of the Posner Center since 2004. Another outdoor sculpture, often referred to as the “Cheeto,” has been greeting students entering Wean Hall for years. These sculptures, now permanent additions to the Carnegie Mellon campus, are among the many art pieces donated by alumni that now occupy the university’s free spaces.
Soon, Carnegie Mellon students in Pittsburgh will gain a public art space unlike anything the campus has offered to date. The space, two lots at 4628 Forbes Ave., will be a venue for Carnegie Mellon student artists or performers to submit material for approval and exhibition. In contrast to the numerous permanent art pieces throughout campus, displays at the art park will be temporarily showcased on a weekly or biweekly rotation. The art park itself will also be temporary, expected to last three to five years until its land is developed further by Carnegie Mellon.
The park project was originally spearheaded by two staff members from Campus Design and Facility Development, Associate Vice Provost Ralph Horgan and Director of Design Bob Reppe. Horgan and Reppe then contacted Bob Bingham, associate head and professor in the School of Art. Horgan, Reppe, and Bingham collaborated with professional contractors and Carnegie Mellon students in Bingham’s EcoArt class to design the art park. According to Bingham, designers of the art park deliberately considered sustainable elements such as cob walls and a prominent rain garden.
Although core aspects of the park were completed in July, according to Bingham, there are still several features to come, including a kiosk with space designated for community bulletins and a plexiglas panel for the display of student artwork. Also planned are a set of spinning benches, similar to the ones beside the College of Fine Arts building, that will produce electricity to power feature lighting, and a space for film projection. Once these elements have been installed, Bingham hopes to see a master of arts management student appointed to review proposals from students. 
“The vision is for small, temporary art gestures that change on a regular basis,” Bingham said.
Stephanie Ross, a sophomore art major, loves that any student is eligible to contribute to the art park. “It’s wonderful. It’s giving everyone the opportunity to create public work, and encouraging creative output.” As an avid performance artist, she is excited about the exposure that performance art classes could obtain on Forbes.
While the park currently occupies only the south side of Forbes, Bingham shared plans that the current site of the Carnegie Mellon CREATE Lab’s ChargeCar garage across the street will serve as an extension of the park. 
Alison Vellas, a former student who helped to plan the “electric bench” project, said that the park serves Oakland as a reminder that “there is constant room for improvement in our community, and making it environmentally friendly would be a major next step.”

The Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon is launching a new interdisciplinary program called the master of science in robotic systems development (MRSD). In addition to training in robotics technology, students will also be exposed to hands-on practice and business and management opportunities typically not offered within a traditional robotics degree.
Primarily developed by Hagen Schempf, who will be the director of the program, the MRSD will make students more competitive to businesses and industries not only in robotics, but in any field that requires mechanical, electrical, or software expertise. Examples of students who may participate include entry-level professionals or those with five to 10 years of experience in industry, as opposed to those seeking academia or research positions through a traditional degree.
“What I wanted to make sure we offered is the ability to offer a more targeted, industry-savvy graduate that does not just know technology but is also a very knowledgeable business and management individual that would be able to contribute from day one,” Schempf said.
To ensure education equality for students in the new master’s program with Carnegie Mellon’s existing graduate degrees, requirements will be consistent. Applicants will be expected to have comparable GRE and TOEFL scores, as if they were applying to the master of science in robotics. An estimate of 20 to 40 students are expected when MRSD begins accepting applications. Those admitted will experience a 16-month curriculum of 114 units with a mandatory seven-month internship at a Carnegie Mellon commercial or government partner. It is this required internship that sets apart the MRSD from others at schools such as Worchester Polytechnic Institute and MIT. It provides the students the opportunity to test their knowledge and form connections with potential employers.
“You will learn things that would take years to assimilate in an industrial setting. I don’t know of any other degree like this where we have a combination of theory of robotics as well as hands-on and a required internship with a company for whom you may possibly work,” Schempf said.
The strength of the program will draw from talented faculty in the Robotics Institute, the School of Computer Science, the Heinz College, and the Tepper School of Business. In addition to the required internship, core courses will be drawn from systems engineering; manipulation, mobility, and control; sensors and perception; and robot autonomy and networking.
Students will be required to take one business and one technical elective. One project course will involve lecture, laboratory, and team project components in current topics in robotics or automation. The other two-semester business, management, and technical mini-courses will prepare students to develop a technology development plan, or a company’s complete course of action for a new product. More details can be found on the Robotics Institute and MRSD webpages.
“By having a graduate program dedicated to training people in the multi-disciplinary, systems-oriented perspective that is the core of RI robotics, we believe that we will produce graduates that can understand the complete scope of a robotics project, from hardware to software to systems integration,” said Reid Simmons, Ph.D. chair for the Robotics Institute. “This will make them better designers, developers, and managers.”
At the completion of this degree, graduates will be prepared to use their skills in companies or to pursue their own interests and make an impact on a rapidly growing field.
“Robotics technologies are having an impact that lies beyond what people usually imagine. The businesses related to robotics are growing rapidly,” said Matthew Mason, the director of the Robotics Institute. A perfect example, he noted, is Mary Koes, an alumna who helped create new strollers with a juvenile products company called 4Moms.
Regardless of what direction its students pursue, the new MRSD degree is a groundbreaking step. “From personal experience, when I had a start-up, the kinds of individuals that we are going to be training and educating are hard to find. Many companies love to find these individuals,” Schempf said.

It’s been about a year since the School of Computer Science (SCS) moved from Wean Hall to the Gates Hillman Complex, but the school is still very much in a state of transition. With certain departments still awaiting completed renovations or final placements, it is safe to say that all of SCS has not yet found a place to call home.
While the Language Technologies Institute, the Lane Center for Computational Biology, the machine learning department, and the computer science department have moved into Gates Hillman, the Institute for Software Research (ISR) has been consolidated in Wean Hall. As a result, Wean Hall underwent renovations on the fourth and fifth floors last semester, and the work continued into the summer. The finished product is a space dedicated specifically to the ISR, including offices, space for graduate students, conference rooms, and a spacious lounge.
Before moving into Wean, the ISR was spread out over nine different buildings on campus. “As the newest unit of SCS, they didn’t know where to put us, so we were placed wherever there was space,” said James Herbsleb, a professor in the ISR and the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII), in his recently renovated office. “It’s nice to finally have a home in Wean. I love it.”
According to Herbsleb, about half of SCS was moved to Gates Hillman while the remainder still occupies space in Wean.
Both Gates Hillman and Wean, although considered departmental buildings, have space that is open to use for the entire university. Students have been known to take classes ranging from calculus and programming to Interpretation and Argument in Gates Hillman, while Wean offers space for modern language courses and temporary offices.
Some of the departments in SCS, such as HCII and the Robotics Institute, are located in Newell-Simon, but just as the bulk of SCS moved into Gates Hillman, there are other moves soon to take place. “Originally I was located on the second floor of Smith Hall, but I was moved to Wean this year and I’m waiting on [certain offices] in Newell-Simon to move to Smith so that I can move there,” said Christopher Dellin, a graduate student of the Robotics Institute.
Dellin and his officemate Hyunggi Chu, a senior research programmer, are both temporarily located in Wean Hall, in the ISR domain, until space opens up for them.
“[Wean] is nice compared to Smith, but I really can’t wait to move into Newell-Simon. They’ve got windows,” Dellin said.
Despite the school still working between multiple buildings and many individuals still awaiting final placements, most computer science majors see the move as a great improvement over their previous arrangements.
“Overall I think this building is a better fit,” said Eric Faust, a sophomore computer science major and a teaching assistant in the School of Computer Science. “Wean is shut in. There are times that I’ve spent over 36 hours in Wean working on a project, and it’s like, I haven’t seen sunlight in over 24 hours.”

“I can’t wait to ment!” Ashley Brienza, a sophomore in CIT, exclaimed in passing, a simple sign of the anticipation the once-disjoint McGill House community has for its newest program. 
McGill, Carnegie Mellon’s only all-female dormitory, is encouraging female empowerment through a group that has been six months in the making. The separation that existed between the upperclassman floor and the two floors of first-years in the past is looking to be broken as nine upperclassmen have been chosen to live in McGill as part of a new mentoring program called “Sparkle.”
These nine mentors — eight sophomores and one junior — started the planning process with the house staff in April to come up with a vision for the relationships to be fostered in the McGill community. 
Sophomore psychology major Jenny Patel, the resident assistant for the third floor and supervisor of the McGill Mentor program, described the vision of the new program. 
“McGill is a community focused on empowerment through confidence. By building positive relationships between the girls,  the mentors hope to establish a sense of ‘can do’ in these women, aiding in the transition into college and helping to promote positive interaction and involvement by McGill as a whole,” she said.
The mentors returned to school early to organize events and to meet the first-years in their Orientation environment. Several mentors joined in first-year floor meetings and discussions, anxious to meet the women of McGill, while attending their own mentor meetings daily. 
These early congregations involved organizing a service event with a fun kindergarten theme, juice boxes and animal crackers included, and creating a questionnaire to be used for matching residents with a particular mentor with whom they can develop the best personal and working relationship.
This past Saturday, after a series of more formal introductions, the surveys were offered to the first-years on the first and second floors who wished to be paired with a mentor. Almost every resident present picked up a form, to the great pleasure of the mentors. These applications are due today and will then be hand-matched by the McGill staff.
Sophomore social and decision sciences major Nicole DiMascio expressed her enthusiasm. “I’m really excited to get to know these girls on a personal level instead of just being a casual housemate,” she said.
As a way to help the residents get to know the mentors, a large poster has been placed in the stairwell with pictures and detailed information on each mentor, from major, hometown, and club involvement to fun facts and favorite foods. The first-years of the community have had a great deal of fun with this poster, finding mentors with whom to have Razzy Fresh excursions or spend an evening watching Jane Austen movies.
“I’m really excited to get a mentor. It will be a good experience for us freshmen to have someone to talk to, not just each other, who is more experienced with the school, the campus, and general social experiences. It will help make the transition much easier,” said Leslie Sainz, a first-year in H&SS who lives on the second floor.
As much as the McGill Mentors program is about building pride and a sense of community within the house, the mentors are also hoping to have an impact both on the Carnegie Mellon community as well as the greater Pittsburgh region through service projects with their mentees and global focuses of their programming.

** Fienberg argues the value of accurate census statistics **
In light of changed methodology for collecting census data in both the United Kingdom and Canada, as well as the recent change in the U.S. Census Bureau’s communication strategies, Carnegie Mellon’s Stephen E. Fienberg argues that the detailed economic and demographic information collected in these processes is much too valuable to lose.
Recently, the U.S. Census Bureau has received increasing pressure from members of Congress who propose curtailing the American Community Survey, which has replaced the mandatory long-form census. 
Fienberg and Columbia University’s Kenneth Prewitt joined together to write an opinion paper, recently published in Nature, that argues that governmental moves toward simplified surveys with smaller distributions will have devastating effects. 
Specifically, the professors argue against the Canadian government’s choice to change a mandatory long-form questionnaire sent to 20 percent of the population to a voluntary survey sent to 30 percent, and the UK’s discussion of using only records from official documents, including post office address lists, driver’s license records, and health registers.
According to a university press release, Fienberg and Prewitt explained their position, commenting, that “census data provide the gold standard against which all other studies on such issues can be corrected and judged.”
Unigo lists Carnegie Mellon as one of the ‘New Ivies’
Unigo, an online database of university students’ reviews, has recently listed Carnegie Mellon as a “New Ivy,” a description the university shares with Duke University, Johns Hopkins University, New York University, Northwestern University, Tufts University, the University of Virginia, Washington University in St. Louis, Wellesley College, and Williams College. According to Unigo, these New Ivies are “a quintessential list of schools every top-caliber student should take very seriously.”
Editors of the website, which targets high school students and parents, surveyed more than 30,000 students at 225 colleges for their opinions about their own schools and peer institutions for their yearly ranking.
Though Unigo boasts the slogan “College students tell you what the colleges won’t,” Carnegie Mellon’s reviews were only positive. The article deeming Carnegie Mellon a “New Ivy” claims that “the approximately 6,000 undergrads at this Pittsburgh, PA school won’t stop raving about their ‘brilliant’ professors who go out of their way to ‘know who you are,’ and the ‘truly intellectual environment’ this creates. There’s something else it also creates: ‘a workload that is not to be taken lightly.’  ”

For many Carnegie Mellon students, the beginning of the semester also marks the start of meetings, info sessions, and recruitment for various student activities and organizations. For those who participate in the Greek system, it marks the start of fall recruitment. This week, we look at the stats and figures concerning the impact of our sororities and fraternities:
The number of Greek organizations on campus that earned chapter QPAs above the university average: 10
The percentage of Greeks who were involved in other campus organizations: 68
The amount of money raised for local, national, and international charities by individual chapters: $41,781 
The number of hours of community service contributed by fraternities and sororities: 9,781
The number of undergraduate students who are members of fraternities or sororities: 1,102

Often when the editorial board takes a position, we choose one of a variety of possible opinions. There are multiple valid viewpoints about, for instance, privacy concerns in Facebook Places. We prefer these arguments, as debate can lead to new ideas.  However, this week we must now focus on a different type of argument, one over a certain fact.
You might hope that there was general agreement around things that can be provably correct, but a recent poll from the Pew Research Center has shown that 18 percent of Americans, or nearly one in five, believe President Barack Obama is Muslim (rising to 34 percent among conservative Republicans).
The Huffington Post ran a response to this in the form of a slideshow of other facts that one in five Americans believe, including that nearly 20 percent of Americans cannot identify America on an unlabeled map of the world, believe witches are real, cannot name the country we declared our independence from in 1776, and believe the sun revolves around the Earth.
We are not sure if this is meant to make us feel better about Barack Obama’s seemingly unknowable religious beliefs or throw us into a deep depression about the state of education in this country.
Obama came to Carnegie Mellon this summer and spoke about, among many topics, how education remains one of the most important investments to provide for the future of America. And there are some seriously distorted pieces of knowledge that have gotten stuck, and stayed stuck, in the minds of many Americans. They were not removed or displaced by scientifically accepted truths through a grade school education, or even through a high school degree (possessed by over 85 percent of Americans over the age of 18).
And the correct versions of these facts have not been taught through the media — through television and newspaper and the other ways that Americans get their information. In fact, when those who believe Obama is a Muslim were asked how they learned that, 60 percent cited the media. For the record, he’s not.

In recent weeks, the deceptively named “Ground Zero mosque” has moved to the forefront of public debate. On one side stand the self-proclaimed defenders of the First Amendment, on the other the champions of America’s vaunted Christian traditions and values. Despite the characterizations promoted by both sides, this debate is complex. 
Even though both sides have valid points, in many ways this conflict is not between West and East or Islam and Christianity — it is between fear of the Other and commitment to principles. Building a mosque in Manhattan will not destroy the fabric of American society. But disputing Muslims’ right to build mosques in Manhattan, in Tennessee, in California — that is a dangerous step down a dark road.
It would be convenient to think that the recent debate over the Ground Zero mosque shows a disturbing new trend in American society. That would mean that America's past could be as glorious as we pretend and that only the present is plagued by such controversy. If only we could go back to our roots, this fallacy holds, we could bring back America’s core values. Both opponents and supporters of the mosque would like to believe this, with advocates referring to the First Amendment and opponents to the country’s Christian heritage. 
But these ideals are only pleasant lies. Compared to this country’s past crimes, the mosque controversy is currently a friendly disagreement. This does not mean, however, that the debate is unimportant. This nation’s history makes it all the more necessary that we take a firm stand for the basic rights guaranteed in the Constitution, lest we repeat the darker chapters of our past.
At the same time that the United States was being founded on principles of tolerance, patriots were burning down the houses of Tories in the Revolutionary War. When soldiers were dying to free Europe from the Nazis and Marines were hoisting a flag over Iwo Jima, euphemistically named “internment camps” held over 100,000 Japanese-Americans. This does not even count the “enemy combatants” held indefinitely without charges while American soldiers fought for freedom halfway around the world. Hypocrisy is not new to this union.
Knowing our capacity for evil, it falls to us to avoid the mistakes that previous generations made. In the case of the mosque in New York, it is this time not the government that is trying to deny freedom but a combination of media outlets, opportunistic politicians, and grassroots organizers.
Many opponents of the mosque object to its location at the site of the Sept. 11 attacks. I also object to building a mosque at the former site of the World Trade Center. I object to building a church, a synagogue, a temple, or any other specific religious shrine at that site. People of many and no faiths died that day, and their deaths should not be appropriated by any single religion.
Fortunately for people who accept facts, the mosque is not being built at Ground Zero. It is not being built adjacent to Ground Zero. It is, in fact, two blocks away on Park Place. According to an article published in The New Yorker, the mosque will not be visible from the future Ground Zero memorial. When it is completed, it will be a symbol of America’s tolerance and a demonstration that we do not judge an entire people by the actions of a few.
While most media and popular references refer to the construction under debate simply as a mosque, this — like so many of the other parts of this argument — is a misleading simplification. 
Though it should not matter if the building is a mosque or not, it is important to note that the mosque is only part of an entire community center called Park51. It has classrooms, a swimming pool, a restaurant, and a Sept. 11 memorial. Its operators, the Cordoba Initiative, have a mission to support intercultural understanding. Even the most cynical observer would have to admit that the complex will be under close scrutiny from law enforcement and the public alike given its location. The risks, then, seem minimal. The symbolic and practical advantages seem obvious.
The “Ground Zero mosque” — neither at Ground Zero nor simply a mosque — is an opportunity. It is an opportunity to demonstrate that the Constitution is more than words on paper and that tolerance can succeed in spite of challenges. It is an opportunity to show that America has not forgotten the darker times of its past but seeks a better future. It is an opportunity to accept diversity as strength, to put humanity above xenophobia. Above all, it is an opportunity to make our nation not what it was, but what we wish it to be.

A federal district judge granted a preliminary injunction last week to cease funding of embryonic stem cell research. This injunction overrides an executive order issued by President Barack Obama last year that allowed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to fund this kind of research. The judge’s decision is regarded by some as simply a way for fringe extremists to hinder scientific research. Though I would not be so extreme, I agree that embryonic stem cell research should be funded by the NIH.
In order to understand why embryonic stem cells are so important, it is important to first understand what stem cells are and why they have so much potential. Stem cells are blank cells. The vast majority of cells in the human body are highly specialized. Skin cells contain exactly the parts to be skin cells and nothing more. The same goes for liver cells, heart muscular cells, and so on. Stem cells, however, contain all of the information and parts to become any cell in the body. Adult stem cells — though they exist — are limited in scope. They fall into one of three categories: mesodermic, endodermic, and ectodermic. Stem cells in each of these categories can only become certain types of cells. Very complex organs, like the skin, require multiple or all three types of cells to properly form themselves. This reduces the utility of adult stem cells.
In order to harvest embryonic stem cells directly, researchers first artificially inseminate an egg — they create a “test-tube baby.” However, once this egg has undergone the natural processes of cell division and expanded to between 50 and 150 cells, the mass, now called a blastocyst, is broken apart, and the embryonic stem cells at its core are extracted. Unfortunately, current techniques require the destruction of the blastocyst in order to extract the stem cells. 
It is this process that is objected to by both scientists and pundits. In general, objectors believe that human life begins at conception, when the sperm meets and combines its DNA with an egg. Since human life begins at this point, it is immoral to perform the extraction procedure since it destroys human life. It is important to note that the arguments against stem cell research are not exactly the same as those against abortion, as some opponents of abortion are proponents of stem cell research. The difference, and seeming clash of ideologies, comes from the results of in vitro fertilization, where, for technical reasons, there are extra embryos that would otherwise be destroyed.
It is also important to note that this debate has recently fallen to the wayside. In 2008, scientists at UCLA were able to transform skin cells into stem cells. These cells, called induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS cells, are — according to the researchers — “virtually indistinguishable from human embryonic stem cells.” Though the capability of iPS cells to completely replace embryonic stem cells has not been verified, this method of creating stem cells may completely remove the need for the previously described extraction technique to be used. However, there is some concern over the technical requirements to create these cells, as performing the transformation into iPS cells requires successful genetic manipulation.
Even discounting the advances in iPS, it is absurd to completely cease funding of embryonic stem cell research. Further research into embryonic stem cells may reveal ways of extracting embryonic stem cells without destroying the blastocyst, and thus preserving the human life contained within. In fact, this is a logical path of research for government-funded projects to pursue. With the ability to extract stem cells from blastocysts, a blastocyst can be artificially shrunk and reverted to a previous stage in the development cycle. This would allow a single embryo to not only persist and continue to contribute stem cells for some time, but would allow researchers to grow replacement organs for children born after the donating embryo is implanted into the mother’s uterus.
Between the possible benefits of stem cell research, which are widely known and far too numerous to list here, and the potential for inventing techniques that can circumvent the destruction of the blastocyst, there is no convincing reason that embryonic stem cell research should be suspended, at least until iPS cells are proven to be equivalent to their embryonic counterparts.

Facebook’s newest feature, a location-based service dubbed “Places,” is the latest in a series of updates to the popular social networking site. However, what separates Places from previous additions, including the company’s most recent privacy updates or the News Feed, is the lack of protest from users. So far, criticism of Places has been limited only to a minority of bloggers and forum users — a fact that drastically contrasts the outcry that followed Facebook’s release of Beacon, a feature that published what users were buying and that eventually resulted in a $9.5 million settlement.
While Facebook Places may not warrant a $9.5 million lawsuit, the service certainly includes features that we consider problematic. The concept itself — a service that allows users to check in at any location such as a mall or a local business and simultaneously allows users to see the locations of all their friends — may be a little overbearing, but is certainly nothing to protest. After all, services such as FourSquare have been allowing location check-ins long before Places came out. However, one aspect of the service that may make some uncomfortable is the ability to tag and check in friends, even if they’re not present at a location. Thus, the control is often not in the hands of individual users but of their friends — especially if they have not opted out of the Places service. While this system of controls is similar to photo tagging, people’s current location does not equate to a past photo of them.
This brings up our main concern with Places — the fact that all Facebook users are opted in to the service by default. This means that it is running automatically for every user, and, even if users themselves do not actively use the service, their friends may check them in. Furthermore, when Places first became available, users were not introduced to the product, so most users may not even be aware that the service exists. To learn about the service, Facebook users must follow multiple links until they finally arrive at Facebook’s blog, which then directs them to a series of FAQ pages and a video
And what if users want to disable the feature? Well, it is not as easy as clicking a recognizable “No thanks” link. Instead, users must follow a long series of directions that includes customizing their privacy settings, disabling a feature called “People Here Now,” and editing a section called “Info Accessible Through Your Friends” by ensuring that “Places I check in to” is not chosen.
Sound complicated? We think so too. For full instructions on how to adjust who can expose your location on Places, be sure to visit and carefully follow the directions at www.facebook.com/help/#!/help/?faq=17402.

Returning students to Carnegie Mellon are always met with changes. Some of these are immediately noticeable, like renovated housing or a new building on campus. Others seem more minor, but they nevertheless improve students’ experiences at the university.
Most upperclass students will remember taking the pass/fail Computing at Carnegie Mellon (C@CM) — or, in its previous iteration, the Computing Skills Workshop — course in their first year. They likely remember being forced to sit through hours of learning how to use Andrew Calendar, Dreamweaver, and Andrew UNIX. The Class of 2014, however, will have no such memories. They are the first group to take the new online version of C@CM. This jump to an online course is an excellent step forward for Carnegie Mellon’s introductory curriculum.
The most significant change in C@CM is moving from the traditional eight-week mini format meeting three times a week to an online course with an optional classroom component. This allows students to move through the course at their own pace without being shackled to a strict syllabus. As many of the C@CM activities could be completed in 15 of the 50 minutes allotted on a given day, first-years can now spend their time more productively. 
For students who learned Microsoft Word and Excel when they were 12 years old, this means they will not need to spend hours on them in class. In the old format, the best part of C@CM was the extra three hours per week that appeared when it was over halfway through the semester. Now, we hope, students will be able to work at their own pace, spending more time on the parts of the course that actually apply to them rather than sitting through days on end learning how to use Dreamweaver.
While the transition of C@CM from a classroom to an online environment seems like a minor change in the overall context of Carnegie Mellon, we hope that it represents the university’s consideration for students’ priorities. 
It challenges the assumption that just because a course has always been taught a certain way, it cannot be changed. We look forward to a greater variety of course formats in the future so that students can get the most out of their time at Carnegie Mellon.

“You’re going to see the spirit of God unleashed, unlike you have probably ever seen it before.” —Glenn Beck
Yes; this weekend God was unleashed on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. during Glenn Beck’s Restoring Honor rally. There may have been much liberal and comedic mocking in the lead-up to Saturday’s rally-for-the-history-books: Jon Stewart found it “totally plausible” that Beck unintentionally scheduled “Beckapalooza” on the same day and in the same place that Martin Luther King Jr. gave his  “I Have A Dream” speech. Stephen Colbert nicknamed him the Mighty Morphin’ Power Martyr after showing clips of his comparisons to Gandhi and Jesus. Keith Olbermann asked if he would “part the reflecting pool.” Rev. Al Sharpton argued that this would “distort what Dr. King’s dream was about” — but then, wasn’t his dream really about all Americans, regardless if the color of their skin is closer to Beck’s? A.J. Calhoun at Salon hopes that Beck will find his place “soon enough, on the junk heap of history.”
But no — Glenn Beck’s place is not yet on the junk heap of history! On the historic Aug. 28 he stood several stairs below where Martin Luther King Jr. stood. He gathered together Albert Pujois, Alveda King, and even the goddess herself, Sarah Palin, to speak at his rally. He read the Gettysburg Address better than Lincoln ever could have. And he announced that today America is turning back to God.
Yes, soon we will have a country where every man believes in God. A country where nothing goes wrong, because we have God. A democracy that also has a king — God. A unified happy populace because prayer is all our people need. Atheists must leave, or be killed, or be filled with God’s love.
And then, as the crowd chanted in unison that Glenn Beck is the Son of God Himself, the reflecting pool became blood, every first-born in the crowd was smitten, and Sarah Palin was struck with and then cured of leprosy. This was the spirit of God released among the loyal Beck rally. They were fed with endless freedom fries and tea, healed of their alcoholism, and given the ability to speak in truths that were true regardless of facts or the lack of a high school education.
And as the crowd raised their voices to bellow “Amazing Grace,” Beck’s wings sprang forth, and he glided over the crowd, spreading his Mormon religion. 
This was not a political gathering. This was 300,000 people being touched by God. The American God. The God that will save this country from that racist president who hates white culture. The God who knows that the Constitution doesn’t really want church and state to be so separate. Our God. (Don’t build that mosque.) Amen.
Patrick Gage Kelley (pkelley@) is a contributing editor for The Tartan. He welcomes responses from the Church of Glenn Beck.

We hear it over and over — Carnegie Mellon is a university committed to interdisciplinary thinking, embracing diversity, and molding its students into architects of change. The news releases coming out of our research centers are extraordinary and deserve the praise and attention of our university community. But beyond the classroom, a broad array of students embrace these ideas in a different way — through their participation in and leadership of student organizations.
These organizations — Greek life included — should not be thought of as a mere diversion from the more “serious” business that Carnegie Mellon is conducting. Rather, the contributions that students are making and the skills they are learning outside of the classroom are now absolutely critical to ensuring Carnegie Mellon’s place as a top university. 
Consider, for example, the university’s Emergency Medical Services (EMS), a group of students who provide professional-level emergency medical treatment. The leadership that an EMS crew chief needs to display in managing potentially life-and-death situations can’t be taught in a classroom even by the best professor; it has to be experienced. Nowhere is interdisciplinary work more clear than in each Carnival’s Scotch’n’Soda show, in which engineering students and arts students work together — and often switch their traditional roles — in order to build something bigger than the individual. 
The point is this: Student life is quickly becoming Carnegie Mellon’s key differentiating factor. Students are seeking it out, soaking it in, and asking for more. The problem, however, is that this increased passion is both a blessing and a curse. The number and intensity of new student organizations is vastly outpacing the tiny increase in the student activities fee each year. Performing arts organizations are rehearsing in conference rooms and battling each other for a day or two in Rangos — a space not even built as a performance venue. Some Booth and Buggy organizations have laughably little storage and construction space. Faculty understanding of the drive that students put into their extracurricular activities is far too low. 
As your student body vice president for organizations, my goal is to help ensure the future of student organizations. As students, we owe it to ourselves to be our own best advocates. So if you love student organizations as much as I do, join me. Together we can ensure that student life becomes one of Carnegie Mellon’s strongest qualities.
