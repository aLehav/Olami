The Carnegie Mellon football team wrapped up an undefeated home stand against Westminster on Saturday to pull their record for the season to an even 2–2. After a slow offensive start, Carnegie Mellon rode a solid performance by their defense and Westminster mistakes to an exciting 27–24 win.
The first half opened with traded punts, and neither team was able to establish much of a start offensively. On Westminster’s second offensive drive, junior outside linebacker Nico Comsa jumped a route near the Carnegie Mellon sideline and returned an interception 24 yards for a touchdown, setting the tone for a very good defensive half for Carnegie Mellon. Westminster had one threatening drive in the first half, but senior defensive tackle Johnathan Tanner burst into the backfield and stripped the ball, recovering the fumble and ending Westminster’s possession at Carnegie Mellon’s four-yard line. Outside of that drive, Westminster managed less than 90 yards of offense in the entire half. Due to both the swarming defense from Carnegie Mellon and a missed 45-yard field goal, Westminster was unable to get more than a field goal on the board in the first half. The Carnegie Mellon offense had trouble moving the ball as well, and the defensive score accounted for their lone points of the first half.
The second half went much differently. Westminster’s first drive of the half went 78 yards for a touchdown. The ensuing extra point attempt failed, but still gave Westminster a 9–7 lead that they would keep until Carnegie Mellon pulled ahead on a field goal several minutes later.
The game sped up from that point. Westminster scored a touchdown on a pass to the corner of the endzone that split the Carnegie Mellon secondary. For the two-point conversion attempt, Westminster lined up their offensive line all the way on the left side of the field, but the throw came over the middle and put Carnegie Mellon in a seven-point hole with 3:40 left in the third. 
Carnegie Mellon answered with a great kick return by first-year running back Sam Benger, setting Carnegie Mellon up at the Westminster 21. Sophomore running back Zach Cree carried the ball across the goal line to capitalize on the excellent field position and tied the game at 17.
After a series of traded punts, Westminster broke the deadlock with just over five minutes left in the contest with a touchdown pass. Carnegie Mellon answered by going to the hurry-up offense, but the drive stalled on the Westminster 36-yard line after a turnover on downs. The defense remained stout, however, and forced Westminster into a three-and-out on the following drive, getting Carnegie Mellon the ball back with just under three minutes left on the clock.
Hearon completed three consecutive passes and scrambled to set Carnegie Mellon up on the Westminster 25-yard line, where he delivered a strike to first-year wide receiver John Prather in the endzone. The pass was broken up by a blatant defensive pass interference penalty, setting up Carnegie Mellon with the ball on the one yard-line. Hearon then completed the touchdown pass to senior tight end Hayden Cardiff. The extra point was good, and the game was tied at 21 with 43 seconds remaining.
Westminster’s attempt at a game-winning drive got off to a quick start with two straight completed passes going out of bounds and setting up Westminster at their own 41-yard line, not too far off from field goal range. The third pass, however, floated through the air and landed directly in the hands of junior cornerback Ryan Aitken, setting up Carnegie Mellon with excellent field position but only 19 seconds to try and push the ball for a game-winning score.
Carnegie Mellon’s game-winning drive did not start well. A dropped pass, a short run, and a sack set Carnegie Mellon up with one second left on the clock. The hail mary pass was foiled when Westminster got into the backfield and took down Hearon for a sack to force overtime, but a facemask penalty gave Carnegie Mellon 15 yards and one untimed down to finish the game. After initially sending the offense onto the field, first-year kicker Tyler Kohman came out to attempt a 50-yard field goal to give Carnegie Mellon the win.
The kick cut through the wind and rain to bounce off the cross bar and through, giving Carnegie Mellon a 27–24 win.
The kick came on the heels of Kohman winning the President’s Athletic Association Special Teams Player of the Week for his excellent punting against Geneva College.
The field goal was the longest in Carnegie Mellon 
history.
After winning two nail biters at home, Carnegie Mellon football will attempt to keep the momentum going when it travels to West Virginia to face Bethany College next Saturday.

At the beginning of the semester, I predicted that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers would significantly improve from their under .500 record last season and that the New Orleans Saints had a chance at becoming Super Bowl winners. 
After one quarter of the 2014 NFL season, the jury is still out, but these two teams have faltered enough to lose their spots. Here is a breakdown of what went wrong and who takes their places:
Tampa Bay Buccaneers
The Buccaneers’ struggles are not particularly hard to explain. Quarterback Josh McCown has been less “perfect stopgap” than just bad. Tampa figured that much of McCown’s success in Chicago last season could be attributed to a receiving corps that towered over opponents, giving him throwing lanes over most NFL cornerbacks. 
The Bucs replicated that group with wide receivers Vincent Jackson and Mike Evans. Neither of these players has lacked for production this year; the offense’s struggles fall largely on McCown’s shoulders. 
Chicago Bears head coach Marc Trestman installed a very successful offensive system that got a performance from McCown unlike any previously seen in his lengthy NFL career. With the Bucs, McCown went back to being a replacement-level backup, throwing interceptions on six percent of his passes, double the NFL average this season. He even managed to fumble and throw an interception on the same play.
Unfortunately, a thumb injury ended McCown’s season earlier than head coach Lovie Smith could during week three. Backup Mike Glennon has been better, but there are problems besides McCown.
The defense has been terrible. The league might have passed Smith by. The cover two defense he employs looks unimaginative, and quarterbacks are thwarting it with ease. Even with defensive tackle Gerald McCoy and defensive end Michael Johnson missing time, the performance is inexcusable. 
Safety Dashon Goldson and cornerback Alterraun Verner have both been huge disappointments after multiple successful years. Weakside linebacker Lavonte David has been pedestrian, a far cry from his planet-eating peak last season. 
Teams are passing on the Bucs with ease and then running through empty boxes as the defense adjusts. This team’s strength from last year — the unit that dragged it to the lofty ranks of 4–12 — looks like it might be a disaster heading into the year.
Even so, there is cause for hope. The Bucs should have won week two, when a 10-second runoff stemming from a player’s injury prevented them from attempting a game-winning field goal. 
However, Glennon is only a slight upgrade over McCown, and Smith’s scheme looks aged out. The Bucs were thoroughly outplayed in a week four victory, and this team is bad.
Dallas Cowboys
The Cowboys should take this spot. As an 8–8 team last season with a salary cap debacle, no one expected the Cowboys to be good this year. 
The team was punchless except for a strong passing offense, and quarterback Tony Romo had sustained another serious back injury. They had nothing left.
The improvement started on the offensive side of the ball. The Cowboys’ biggest problem last year was game management. Romo was forced to pass downfield with huge leads. This led to shoddy route running by a team that had taken its foot off the gas pedal, and these broken routes led to late-game interceptions.
This year, the Cowboys have finally discovered that they are allowed to run the ball. The team has a great offensive line, and running back DeMarco Murray has improved massively every year. He is football’s best running back through four weeks, and it isn’t particularly close. This performance is allowing the Cowboys to keep their defense off the field, retain leads, and play winning football. 
Even though Romo’s back injury has turned him from a great passer into an erratic mess, that is mitigated by the overhaul in play calls. 
In a game where running the ball is usually a bad idea, the Cowboys are constructed in a way that it is beneficial, and they finally noticed.
The defense has somehow been passable as well, with castoffs like middle linebacker Rolando McClain and defensive tackle Henry Melton performing admirably. Through four weeks, the team ranks slightly below average by Football Outsider’s Defensive Value Over Average (DVOA) and outside of the emergence of cornerback Orlando Scandrick, there is not really much of note. After last year’s defensive horror show, slightly below average and nothing of note is much better. 
The combination of that and a humming offense has the Cowboys sitting pretty at 3–1 and in a position to maybe break their seemingly endless streak of 8–8 seasons.
New Orleans Saints
The New Orleans Saints have gotten off to an awful 1–3 start. After the team had a great offense and pass defense last year, it seemed like they would return that combination and free safety Jairus Byrd would be an improvement over Roman Harper, a human manifestation of blown coverages.
The offense has been playing well. Its numbers are deflated by a series of rushing teams shortening games against the Saints, but they’re putting huge numbers on the board week after week anyway. Offenses also tend to play worse when behind, as risks necessary for comebacks lead to turnovers.
The defense, on the other hand, has been horrible. Outside linebacker Junior Galette and defensive end Cameron Jordan have not been the terrifying duo many expected. Furthermore, the sixth-ranked pass defense from last season has blown coverage after coverage in the secondary.
It starts with Byrd. It seems like former Bills defensive coordinator knew how to maximize Byrd’s skills in Buffalo, as Byrd has looked completely lost in Rob Ryan’s system in New Orleans. He is consistently blowing coverages and wandering aimlessly through the defensive backfield. Further, he has now been placed on injured reserve with a torn lateral meniscus ligament. 
Across from corner Keenan Lewis, the other corner slots have been a nightmare, with number two receivers wreaking havoc on the hapless duo of Corey White and Patrick Robinson. The Saints have glaring holes, and they’re easily exploitable. 
That doesn’t cut it for a team once named a title contender.
Cincinnati Bengals
The team initially slated to take the Saints’ spot in the contenders column during my initial predictions, however, was the Cincinnati Bengals. They’re 3–0 with the bye after four weeks, and they’ve looked incredible. 
The team is largely the same as last year’s successful team, with a very stout pass rush and solid secondary, but there are three key changes.
First, cornerback Leon Hall’s return has made the secondary terrifying. He has snuffed out passing plays and dominated great passing offenses like the Atlanta Falcons and the Baltimore Ravens. Second, running back Gio Bernard is a true star. He’s been unstoppable over the Bengals’ three games in both receiving and running. Third, quarterback Andy Dalton is responding to his contract extension in the best possible way. He was actually a good quarterback when not under pressure, but he turned into a quivering mess when the rush broke through, despite Cincy’s excellent offensive line.
This season? He’s actually been pretty solid beating the rush. Bernard has thrust him into a caretaker role, but Dalton is improving the team rather than hurting it this season. That could be huge going forward. 
If they keep this up, expect a more in-depth breakdown of the NFL’s fourth true contender.
After Sunday’s early afternoon games, nothing much changed.
The Saints and Buccaneers played each other, putting on a sloppy performance plagued by turnovers, drops, and lazy defense.  The final score saw New Orleans win in overtime after running back Khiry Robinson ran for a touchdown.
New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees was uncharacteristically inconsistent when trying to push the ball.  He threw three interceptions, including one on a potentially game-winning drive for New Orleans to close out regulation.
Mike Glennon played about as well as Brees, which is way more than the Bucs could have hoped for, but neither played a particularly good game.
Both defenses faltered, as the scoreboard was spinning for most of the game.
The Cowboys pulled out an overtime win over the Houston Texans, leaning on DeMarco Murray for 136 yards.  Romo improved on his previously erratic performances and completed close to 70 percent of his passes, including touchdowns to wide receivers Dez Bryant and Terrence Williams.
The Bengals played later in  the day against the New England Patriots.

This weekend, the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s tennis teams both played at home at the indoor facility in Monroeville.
On Friday, the women’s team took on Oberlin College as it returned to the duel format after last playing in an individual format. 
The Tartans quickly opened up a 3–0 lead in the doubles competition with the pairings of sophomore Vanessa Pavia and first-year Katie Lai, along with first-years Stacy Chang and Cori Sidell both winning their matches 8–2. 
Seniors Bryn Raschke and Angela Pratt had a bit more trouble in the first doubles spot, needing to go to the tiebreaker before finally winning 9–8(7–3).
Carnegie Mellon kept rolling in singles play, going a combined 5–1 with sophomore Nicholle Torres, first-year Kalyani Narayan, Chang, and Sidell all winning in straight sets. 
Chang and Sidell were particularly impressive, they each only dropped one point each set as they both won 6–1, 6–1.
This marked the end of the season for the Tartans, who will compete next in February.
The men’s team played host to Oberlin and Ohio Wesleyan on Saturday. 
In the afternoon against Wesleyan, the Tartans came out strong, sweeping the doubles play. 
Senior Bryce Beisswanger and junior Yuvraj Kumar won 8–1 in the number one spot while senior Will Duncan and sophomore Jack Kasbeer, along with sophomores Kunal Wadwani and Kenny Zheng, won easily, 8–2 and 8–3, respectively.
The Tartans kept the good times going in the singles matches, with all six men taking their matches in straight sets. Junior Abishek Alla and first-year Tommy Cheng, were the most dominant, each winning their sets 6–1, 6–1.
At night, Carnegie Mellon hosted Oberlin and kept the same momentum from earlier, sweeping both doubles and singles again. 
Sophomore Kiril Kirkov and Wadwani won their match 8–3, while Beisswanger and Kumar struggled a bit more, finishing 7–4. Kasbeer and Duncan needed the tiebreaker 9–7.
In singles, while it was still a straight sweep, it took a bit more effort; multiple players needed tiebreakers to win their matches.
Alla and Cheng again won in straight sets, and were matched in that feat by Zheng, who had the best play, winning 6–2, 6–0.
Carnegie Mellon will compete next on Sunday when they host Amherst.

Men’s Soccer
The Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team started their University Athletic Association (UAA) schedule on Saturday when they traveled to Chicago to face off against the University of Chicago Maroons. The two teams each came into the game with six wins and looked even.
The play on the field confirmed that, as the two sides tied 0–0 after 20 minutes of extra play. Even the box scores looked even, with each team tallying nine shots.
The heated contest resulted in multiple fouls for both team, 20 for the Tartans and 12 for the Maroons, plus several yellow cards. After only one card in the first half, belonging to Chicago, the teams combined for four yellows in the second half and three more in overtime. The cards were not just limited to players, as the entire Carnegie Mellon team received a yellow in the 70th minute.
Senior goalkeeper Jacob Rice recorded his first shutout of the season. Rice and the Tartans play next on Saturday at home against Washington in their second UAA match.
Women’s Soccer
The No. 4-ranked Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team continued their undefeated season as they traveled to No. 12-ranked University of Chicago to open UAA play.           Sophomore forward Megan Bartoshuk opened up a lead early with a goal, her second of the season. Bartoshuk’s goal in the 11th minute came off of a cross to the six yard box by senior forward Savina Reid.
Discontent with only a 1–0 lead, the Tartans quickly scored again in the 22nd minute with first-year Keely Jelinek’s first goal of the season. This time the goal was set up off of a corner kick by senior Lauren Simicich.
After playing defensively for the rest of the match, the Maroons finally got on the board with a goal in the 83rd minute. However, this was too little too late, as Carnegie Mellon won 2–1.
The Tartans will to push to 10–0–0 on Saturday when they host the No. 1-ranked University of St. Louis.
Volleyball
Traveling to Atlanta, the Carnegie Mellon volleyball team opened UAA play with their first round robin match, facing off against Rochester, Case Western, and host Emory over the course of the weekend.
In their first Saturday match, the Tartans played Rochester and quickly disposed of their foe, winning easily in straight sets. Rochester kept the first set competitive, 25–20, before falling off and losing the last two 25–13 and 25–9.
Senior right setter Ali Celentano and first-year middle blocker Eliza Donohue led the team with seven kills apiece, while sophomore defensive setter Molly Higgins had a team high 13 digs. 
In the second match of the afternoon, Carnegie Mellon faced off against rival Case Western. This match was a bit tougher for the Tartans, but they ultimately prevailed 3–1.
After losing the first two sets 25–19 and 25–21, Case Western battled back and took the third set 25–21 before the Tartans squashed any hopes of a comeback with a 25–13 fourth set victory. Celentano again led the team in with 18 kills, along with sophomore middle blocker Jackie Gibbons and first-year outside hitter Heather Holton, who scored 16 and 13 kills, respectively. This gave them three Tartans with double-digit kills. Higgins again played great defense, recording 22 digs, while sophomore setter and outside opposite Emily Newton had a match high 37 assists.
On Sunday, the Tartans played host Emory. Carnegie Mellon came out strong and took the first two sets 27–25 and 25–19 before dropping three straight sets for their first loss of the weekend, 18–25, 16–25, 4–15. Celentano and Holton led the team with kills in the loss with 12 and 11, respectively, while Higgins and sophomore Ivana Vlahovic led the team in digs with 14 and 10, respectively.
The Tartans next play at the Ithaca Tournament on Friday and Saturday.

Heart disease is a widespread affliction that affects millions of people across the world. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 600,000 people die from sudden cardiac death per year. Due to this overwhelming prevalence, billions of dollars are spent each year on cardiac research.
Adam Feinberg, assistant professor of materials science and biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon, recently received a three-year $750,000 grant from the Human Frontier Science Program for research on cellular synchronization in the heart.
The research is a collaboration between Feinberg and Peter van der Meer, a cardiology professor at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. The grant, which was specifically intended to fund international collaboration, will be split between the two researchers. Feinberg’s research team also includes John Szymanski and Quentin Jallerat, biomedical engineering Ph.D. students at Carnegie Mellon University.
In order for the heart to function properly, there must be synchronized electrical signals between the heart muscle cells, which are called cardiomyocytes. With proper synchronization, the heart experiences strong contractions, which result in proper blood flow; improper synchronization results in decreased blood flow, which can be fatal.
The team will use mechanical biosensors developed by Feinberg’s research group to measure the mechanical interactions between cardiomyocytes and determine how this mechanical interaction affects their electrical connections. The biosensors can be integrated into bioengineered heart tissue, where they measure mechanical stress and strain. As the cells pull on each other, they stretch the sensors, which quantify how the cells physically interact.
“We’re trying to understand how the mechanical connections of cardiomyocytes have to be formed in order for the cells to form electrical connections,” Feinberg explained. “Every time the heart beats, the muscle cells contract and pull on each other. We want to know how these mechanical connections form the foundation for electrical connections.”
Through the collaboration with van der Meer, the research team can take mouse embryonic stem cells, which can be turned into cardiomyocytes, and alter the genes that allow for the mechanical coupling of cells.
“Van der Meer can remove genes that are responsible for the proteins that control the mechanical couplings between cells,” said Feinberg. “He can develop these stem cells where we can turn different genes off and back on in the same cell without killing it, so we can turn these mechanical adhesions on and off and see how that disrupts electrical connections.”
Feinberg also commented on the interdisciplinary nature of the research: “Typically when a biologist or even a physician thinks about a certain disease, they don’t really think about mechanical forces, but these forces are directly tied to the way things work.” Due to the combination of engineering and biology within the research, the team sees a variety of possible applications for the research.
The main application of the research is insight into arrhythmia. Arrhythmia can be defined as a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat, which corresponds to electrical dysfunction of the heart. Most arrhythmias are benign, yet some can be severely damaging or even fatal.
“The research will give us more information about the underlying mechanisms of arrhythmia,” Feinberg explained. “It won’t address all cases, but it can give us some insight into cases where the mechanical coupling of cells underlies the arrhythmia.”
The research could also potentially impact the treatment of many diseases associated with arrhythmia that occur in the elderly. “If we know the cause of the arrhythmia, then we can potentially develop therapeutics,” Feinberg said. “It could be a small molecule drug that we give someone to alter the mechanical connection between cells, or if gene therapy is a reality in the future, then we can potentially address it that way.” Feinberg also mentioned that the research could have applications aside from treating arrhythmia. 
“The ability to create these sensors allows us to do live real time tracking of mechanical strain and stress in these living tissues as they grow and develop,” he said. “That will help us try to understand what some of the forces involved in the formation of different kinds of tissue structure are during embryonic development.”

Why is one able to feel pain and excitement? How does one listen and see? Behind our eyes and ears, there is an extremely complicated neuron system. Information is believed to be encoded in the form of electrical and chemical signals in our body, and neurons — electrically excitable cells that maintain electrical gradients across their membranes — are at the core of our transmission of information to the brain. However, while scientists are beginning to understand many of the mechanisms behind neurons, much of neuroscience still remains a mystery. 
Nathan Urban, interim provost and the Dr. Frederick A. Schwertz distinguished professor of life sciences, and Robert Kass, professor in the statistics department and machine learning department, have recently received a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant of $930,000 to support their statistical neuroscience and biological research on understanding how neurons encode information. The research is part of BrainHub, a neuroscience research initiative at Carnegie Mellon that brings together scientists from the fields of biology, cognitive psychology, computer science, statistics, and engineering.
According to the Urban Lab website, the lab “work[s] in the areas of cell and synaptic physiology, computational neuroscience ... and on the understanding of mechanisms of synchronous oscillations in networks of neurons.” The brain contains billions of neurons that communicate with each other via synapses, but no two neurons are the same. 
By studying the way that individual neurons react to stimuli, Urban Lab found that different neurons react to the same stimuli differently. “For a long time, we didn’t realize the significance of the differences between neurons. We thought it was just noise,” Urban said in a university press release. “But the subtle nuances play a crucial role in brain function. Understanding the biology behind this could have a tremendous impact on our understanding of how the brain computes information.”
However, Urban’s work alone is not enough to explain the complex processes involved in how our brains compute information. The NSF grant involves a collaboration between the Carnegie Mellon researchers and a group led by Alon Korngreen of Bar-Ilan University in Israel. 
The biophysical techniques developed by Korngreen will be employed to create extremely comprehensive computational models of the biological mechanisms responsible for neuronal activity. The two teams will combine this data with the information collected by Urban and Kass, which connect neural activity to neural computation. 
“Research into the biophysical and statistical analysis of neurons has been running in parallel paths,” Kass said in a university press release. Fitting together the pieces of data collected by the international team and the Carnegie Mellon researchers has the potential to solve the puzzle of the role neuron biology plays in neuronal computation.
The research may contribute to curing brain diseases as well. In his research, Urban also seeks to understand how the expression of particular proteins is related to specific computations performed by neurons. This work could help scientists understand how the mutations in proteins lead to complicated deficits observed in brain diseases.
BrainHub, which was just launched this summer, seeks to elucidate the structure and activity of the brain by combining the efforts of various disciplines not just within Carnegie Mellon, but around the world. BrainHub’s website states, “Taking a global approach to understanding the brain, CMU, with its partners around the world, is uniquely qualified for tackling this sort of highly interdisciplinary research.” 
The brain consists of a complex network of neurons; it will take a network of researchers around the world to understand it.

During the celebrity phone hacking scandal, a small community on Reddit was the main aggregator of stolen photographs. Many called for Reddit to remove the material and close the community. In response, Reddit released a statement titled “EVERY MAN IS RESPONSILBLE FOR HIS OWN SOUL,” in which the company described itself as a government rather than just a “company running a website,’’ with the distinguishing factor being that a government “exercises restraint in the usage of its powers.” Pugwash decided to tackle this issue by discussing whether or not online communities can self-regulate.
Reddit is an entertainment and news community-based website. Anyone can start a community, called a subreddit, which has its own page and followers. Subreddits are moderated by members of the subreddit, rather than employees of Reddit. In other words, they are self-regulated. Popular subreddits include music, pictures, gaming, and movies. The employees of Reddit do not remove content unless required by law to do so. This means that many unpleasant communities also call Reddit their home.
From the start, everyone at Pugwash agreed that those responsible for acquiring and sharing the celebrity photographs were in the wrong. They had done something that was not only probably illegal, but also ethically unsound. However, some argued that although online communities that self-regulate can host unpleasant communities, they are also home to important discussions on issues such as the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), net neutrality, mass surveillance, and the Comcast and Time Warner Cable merger. If these companies did regulate, then important discussions may be censored.
Another important issue was the difference between hosting and linking content. Reddit does not host content; instead, it links to content hosted on other servers. We did not resolve whether or not there is a clear difference between hosting and linking to content, although we did agree that those who link to content are not without blame.
Throughout the discussion, we used physical analogies to better understand what was happening. For example, one member described Reddit as being like an organization that opens a park in which anyone can do whatever they want. In this analogy, it would seem strange to blame the organization for what people do inside the park. Instead, it would seem logical that we should blame the people themselves.
We then moved our discussion from bad communities on Reddit to bullying on Twitter. One could argue that Reddit is quite easy to moderate due to the centralized communities. Twitter, on the other hand, is much more decentralized and thus impossible to moderate. Bullying is rampant on Twitter. For example, Anita Sarkeesian, a feminist, was the target of a cyber mob who attacked her through social media outlets, including Twitter. The attacks, although only online, were incredibly painful and violent, and the perpetrators went unpunished. Sarkeesian is not a special case. Many people, not only the rich and famous, are cyberbullied, and rarely is anything done in response. Those at the meeting agreed that this was a serious issue but did not have any suggestions on how to solve it.
The meeting ended with a poll where we asked whether or not Reddit should have removed the content when they were asked to. A vast majority said that Reddit should have removed the content, but interestingly the entire group agreed that Reddit should not have removed the content before they were asked to.

Sweat-eating bacteria could be cure for acne
In a study presented at the American Society for Microbiology Conference on Beneficial Microbes in Washington, D.C., two groups of volunteers were asked to apply a topical cream on their skin. 
The experimental group’s cream contained ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), which digest ammonia — a large component of sweat. In comparison with the control group, the experimental group showed significant improvements after three weeks. Additionally, volunteers who applied more of the bacteria experienced even greater improvements.
The experimental group did not experience any side effects associated with the treatment. AOB may be the solution to the Food and Drug Administration’s warnings of the rare but life-threatening side effects of current acne products, which contain active ingredients benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. More studies will be conducted to confirm the results of AOB.

Canada opens first large-scale carbon capture plant
Last Wednesday, Canada launched the world’s first attempt at a large-scale carbon capture and storage plant. Located in Estevan, Saskatchewan, the Boundary Dam coal plant took five years and $1.4 billion to modify for the project. As it captures its emissions, most of the extracted carbon dioxide will be stored underground, while some of it will be piped to nearby oil fields to be used for oil recovery. Cenovus Energy, one of Canada’s largest oil and gas companies, has already agreed to purchase the recovered carbon. The expected annual capture of this project is estimated to be the equivalent of taking 250,000 cars off the road.
Skeptics of the agreement have argued that the public should focus on alternative energy needs, including wind and solar power. Ultimately, the project will be a test to see whether reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the usage of capture technology is economically viable.

First domestic case of Ebola confirmed in Dallas hospital
After tests were run on samples taken from a patient in Dallas’s Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the first case of Ebola diagnosed in the U.S. It is believed that the patient may have contracted the virus while visitng relatives in Liberia.
Short for Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Ebola is a disease that arises from a viral infection. Ebola is only contagious if the person exhibits any symptoms, including vomiting and diarrhea. The Dallas patient was reported to have symptoms several days after flying from West Africa to the U.S. Efforts are being made to monitor individuals who have recently been in contact with the patient, including a group of school-aged children.
While the case has brought about public concern, CDC Director Tom Frieden expressed his confidence that the virus will quickly be stopped in its tracks.

Student discovers method to study water on Mars
Kellie Wall, a senior at Washington State University (WSU), studied the potential effects of water on crystal formation in basalt, a dark volcanic rock found in much of eastern Washington and Oregon. Through her collaboration with other researchers, Wall established a way to measure the texture of volcanic rock, which utilizes an index called “groundmass crystallinity.”
On WSU’s campus, Wall used an X-ray diffraction machine to analyze rock samples from the various regions around the world. She then made comparisons with volcanic rock observations made by the rover Curiosity on Mars’s Gale Crater, which also used an X-ray diffractometer.
While her results indicate that the samples of Mars volcanic rock did not erupt with water, Wall’s method may prove to be useful in the ongoing search for life outside of Earth. Wall’s research has been published in Nature Communications.

New drug-delivery capsule may replace injections
On average, a patient would prefer taking a drug orally rather than receiving an injection. However, many drugs cannot be administered as a pill due to the pill’s potential to breakdown in the digestive system.
Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Massachusetts General Hospital are working to solve that issue. They have designed a novel drug capsule, which is covered in a layer of tiny needles. After a capsule is swallowed, the needles are designed to attach to the lining of the stomach and inject the drug into the system. 
Through animal studies, the method has proved more efficient than typical skin injections and did not result in adverse side effects. In the future, the team intends to find additional techniques for enhancing the effectiveness of the drug-delivery capsule and hopes to diminish safety concerns about the needles.

Backdoors to smartphones could be dangerous
While Apple and Google have toughened the encryption of their smartphones, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has been making numerous complaints in response. On Thursday, FBI Director James B. Comey criticized the giant tech companies for making it harder for law enforcement officials to access information stored on a device. Police say such searches are essential to solve a wide range of serious crimes, such as murder and terrorist attacks.
Unfortunately, while creating a backdoor for law enforcement could help the FBI solve more crimes, these backdoors are not possible without making new vulnerabilities in the device.
In the meantime, law enforcement have publicly urged companies to leave such backdoors embedded in their devices.

VIA, the world-renowned multimedia music festival, once again returned to Pittsburgh last week, filling every nook and cranny of the city with music, experimental art, and other events from Oct. 1–5. The festival, which has been a staple of the Pittsburgh cultural calendar since 2010, expanded to include a simultaneous event in Chicago this year, demonstrating the success VIA has had in its hometown.
Venues across the city hosted events, so it was virtually impossible to hit every event, unless you are one of the many Carnegie Mellon students who seem to have a time-turner. We at Pillbox threw our lot in with the following events, and found out a couple of things, such as crowds of hipsters are incredibly boring and there’s no bloodlust like video game bloodlust. We also heard some music — some of it good, some of it not so good — and have decided to share our experiences so those of you who couldn’t attend the festival can do so vicariously through our carefully crafted words.
Real Estate — Wednesday
In the world of indie surf pop, VIA headliner Real Estate is one of the rising stars. Performing their headlining set on the festival’s opening night on Wednesday at the Altar Bar, the band proved their growing skills as a live act.
Each release since 2009’s self-titled Real Estate has built upon their growing momentum. On the heels of their most recent album, Atlas, Real Estate has grown into an independent headliner, taking top slots at the Pitchfork Music Festival and, it goes without saying, the VIA Festival, among others. The effect of the group’s growing popularity could be felt in the room — newer songs such as “Talking Backwards” and “It’s Real” were some of the few moments when the largely stoic crowd began to lose themselves. But that’s okay, because Real Estate isn’t a band that inspires passion, but relaxation.
To attend a Real Estate show is to go under hypnosis; the soft and bright guitars float gently above the rolling sea of grooving bass and steady, controlled drums. Singer Martin Courtney’s vocals, cloaked in a warm blanket of reverb, sound like distant echoes of thoughts shouting from the back of your brain.
Songs like the meandering “Green Aisles” and the wistful, lazy jaunt “Beach Comber” felt like a pleasant dream performed live. In fact, the rowdiest the crowd got all night was after the band left the stage. The entire room erupted in impassioned cheers for the band to return, violently eager for the mellow vibes to be brought back.
If there’s one thing to be said about Real Estate’s fan base, it’s that they’re a pretty homogenous bunch. Walking into their show, a visitor couldn’t help but shield their eyes from the oppressive sameness of a room full of people in their mid- to late 20s. The men wore beards and vintage zip-up hoodies, and the women’s earrings dangled against their necks, their glasses had frames that stretched above their eyebrows.
Having come from the same five-mile radius as the band members, Real Estate has always been a group close to my heart. Ever since hearing the name whispered around Ridgewood, N.J. coffeehouses, each new height of success they reach serves as a little reminder that even if you think you come from nowhere, that doesn’t mean you can’t be someone. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again; Real Estate sounds like how it feels to grow up in New Jersey. And that’s what made the show a little personal. For an hour and fifteen minutes, it was nice to feel like I was back home in Jersey — except without all the fear and loathing that comes with living there.
Liturgy, Deafheaven — Thursday
Let me preface this by saying that I have nothing against the metal genre — as a young guitar player, I marveled at the intricate song structures and lightning-fast finger work of virtuosos such as Metallica’s Kirk Hammet and Slayer’s Kerry King. Is Rob Zombie’s Greatest Hits CD in my car? Yes it is. Does it get played? Only at maximum volume.
That all being said, Thursday night’s performances at the Rex Theater from black metal bands Liturgy and Deafheaven just didn’t do much for me. The bands (seemingly) performed well, but the sounds of each individual instrument just blended into a disorienting cacophony. There was no way to distinguish what each player (except the drummer) was playing, so I found myself unable to establish a connection with the music.
Liturgy’s songs all sounded like a great crescendo that never opened up into anything — the music never felt like it was allowed to run free. You know how at the end of a concert, a band will start making noise on their instruments and they’ll hold it and hold it, and the tension will rise, until they finally all stop at the same time? Well Liturgy sounded like that moment, just stretched for an entire set.
Deafheaven, known for their brand of melodic deathmetal which has helped garner them a decent amount of attention and critical respect in musical circles far-removed from typical metal heads, gave a bit more to chew on. Their use of visuals was particularly striking; psychedelic illustrations and animations flashed on a series of disjointed screens behind them, often moving in near-perfect time to the music. Lead singer George Clarke was energetic and engaged with the crowd well. There were also some very peaceful moments during songs when the rest of the band would drop out and guitarist Kerry McCoy would play some very beautiful and melodic guitar interludes bathed in lush reverb. But these moments were always followed by a sudden assault of screaming and distortion, like biting your tongue while chewing on a piece of sweet candy.
All would’ve been well and good if the atmosphere had been a more physical one. But Deafheaven and Liturgy are deathmetal for the Pitchfork-reading, Brooklyn-pilgrimaging crowd. This was perhaps the only place one would be able to see tattooed biker girls wearing KISS Army denim jackets adorned with pentagrams standing next to pencil-thin hipsters wearing stiff collared shirts and precisely-trimmed beards — and almost none of them were moving. Given a recent hand injury, I was expecting to have to stand in the back, away from the flailing limbs and outpouring energy common at performances of aggressive music. Instead, I was in the thick of the crowd, and the circulation cut off from having my hand tucked into my armpit caused the only pain.
VIA Music Conference — Friday
Friday saw the VIA Music Conference, hosted in the CFA Studio for Creative Inquiry, arrive on Carnegie Mellon’s campus. The entire day was stacked with lectures and demonstrations of electronic equipment, such as Ableton Live. The day concluded with an audio visual performance by Richard Devine and Hector Llanquin.
Michael Johnsen opened the performance with a set of his electronic music. Johnsen got his start working in films before leaving to build his own electronics. A large, friendly-looking man in Ben Franklin spectacles, he sat on the stage surrounded by a mess of wires and gadgets that resembled the floor of a budding computer engineer’s bedroom.
The sounds that emitted from his performance were interesting — a mix of watery bass and clicks, whistles, and scratches. There didn’t seem to be any discernible pattern, but Johnsen’s deliberate movements certainly suggested otherwise. At times the sounds were engaging, but often the cacophony sounded like a chainsaw revving in a slaughterhouse where all the animals know exactly what’s in store for them.
In my opinion, the main event did not fare much better.
Llanquin’s visuals were certainly striking — his surrealist landscapes of geometric shapes and patterns were very well rendered, and successfully created a sense that one was floating through another world. The Chilean artist has worked with multiple formats, including movies and video games, and this varied influence was certainly apparent.
Devine prefaced his audio performance with an admission that he had encountered a host of technical difficulties, including some broken equipment, prior to the performance. “If something catches on fire, well, that’s the end of the performance,” he joked.
Devine’s sounds weren’t much different from Johnsen’s in terms of aesthetic. Industrial and angry screeches emitted from the speakers with an eardrum busting ferocity. It was hard to feel anything but discomfort listening to them, and I couldn’t help but wonder whether the music was really the result of Satan possessing an old Windows 95 machine.
Union Trust Building — Saturday
VIA culminated at the Union Trust Building on Saturday night, Oct. 4. The event’s theme was audiovisual experiences in the modern world, with an art exhibit on the first floor showcasing various technologies, and the club below, featuring acts performing accompanied by visual displays. The performances ranged from local independent acts to a welcome host of LGBTQ rappers.
The audiovisual experience began with the art gallery on the first floor, where two video games, showcased on large projection screens, were available to play. The first game, called Dog Park, allowed four players — each playing a roughly 3-D animated dog in a park — to simply kill the other dogs. The players’ virtual avatars joyously ripped each other apart, the blood and the gore of the display contrasting with the low-resolution graphics ripped straight from a Wii game, numbers popping out of the dogs’ heads as they feasted on each other. Players of the game seemed remarkably invested, whooping when they managed to knock down another dog and maul its defenseless form. Thinking back to all the hundreds of faceless human avatars I’ve killed in games like Halo or Call of Duty, I became fairly unsettled by the display and turned my attention to the other game on display—a charming four-player indie-looking game with simple cartoonish graphics where the objective was to cooperate to use an onscreen avatar (imagine Catdog, except with human torsos at either end) to wrap themselves around a red ball. Both teams of two used their own avatars, and the video game did a good job of displaying the medium’s power as a social accelerator. Completely random strangers were laughing and cooperating as they had to work together to maneuver their avatar around the ball while fending off the other team. It seemed that the exhibit served to showcase both the negative and positive potential of the gaming medium.
Other art exhibits were also on the ground floor of the Union Trust Building — all fitting within the theme of digital art. One such exhibit was an audiovisual movie consisting of YouTube clips. The clips were all extremely surreal, the “weird part” of YouTube for those unfortunate enough to be familiar with the term. Intriguing at first, each individual clip went on for far too long and the exhibit got rather old after a while. Another rather interesting exhibit worked within the new field of augmented reality. Visitors aimed an iPad camera at certain VIA posters arranged around the room and saw a 3-D graphic pop up. The graphics were very low resolution and looked ripped from a video game circa 2001, but the exhibit succeeded in its goal to show an indication of what could be. The graphics moved and had a variety of effects, and perhaps more amazing, they even changed their profile if looked at from different angles, behaving like real objects. With new technologies such as Google Glass and Oculus Rift all slowly becoming realities, the augmented reality that the exhibit’s makers put on display may not be that far away.
The main attractions of the festival were, of course, the musical acts in the basement. A host of independent artists performed on two stages, with an array of screens displaying accompanying visuals. The visual displays rarely had anything to do with the acts and didn’t really contribute to the experience. In fact, the additional light from the display worked against the enjoyment of the concerts, as it was already too bright in the basement even without the gigantic displays. 
In any case, the acts themselves varied in quality. The array of LGBTQ rap performances unfortunately fell flat. Between muddy mixing, poor flow, and beats that weren’t particularly enjoyable (or danceable in any way), the performances were sub-par.
Other artists, however, did a commendable job.Independent act Blue Hawaii, for example, was particularly enjoyable. Lead singer Raphaelle Standell-Preston’s beautiful voice and impressive mixing and looping, worked to create a well-rounded set even though the underlying beats were rather boring. There were stretches when the set dragged, but to Blue Hawaii’s credit, they did a good job of mixing up the flow and the sound of their performance. The energy of the crowd itself was rather sporadic. For every person tangibly contributing to the energy of the field, there were many more just standing around, which sort of dampened the experience.
Overall, the event was fairly enjoyable. Some of the art exhibits, the virtual reality exhibit in particular, were cool to experience. The acts themselves were hit and miss, but if the festival comes around again, Pittsburgh citizens should consider going just for the sheer volume and diversity of acts.

After feeling trapped in a kaleidoscope at Studio 205 during one of the School of Drama’s productions last year, I was a little apprehensive about going to another show in which technology would be so heavily featured. I took comfort in the fact that it would be in the Rauh Theatre of Purnell — a quick getaway should I want to escape during intermission.
Unfortunately, Bliss had no intermission.
This play is about Rein, an engineer who invents a time-travel machine and accidentally teleports from Moscow in the 20th century to Moscow in the 23rd century with a geriatric apartment supervisor and a kleptomaniac. They end up in a classless, utopian society called Bliss, but conflict still arises as the trio of main characters explore the new world.
There are many achievements worth mentioning in this production. For one, it was a fairly successful attempt at comedy, a genre the School of Drama historically hasn’t explored too often. As always, the cast was incredibly talented; senior musical theatre major Annie Yokom (Bunsha) was especially delightful to watch.
The costumes demonstrated a stunning attention to detail that brought characters to life, and the dial-inspired stage design was a powerful, yet subtle, allusion to the theme of time. The choices to switch the genders of the characters and to integrate cast members into the physical setting were bold and effective.
Most importantly, though, there was a refined use of technology. Instead of distracting from or being the foundation of the show, the use of projections — with the exception of a few scattered instances that felt slightly forced — served to enhance the production by bringing the setting into the future.
Unfortunately, none of these redeeming factors could make up for the fact that, whether lost in translation from the page to the stage or butchered by cuts, the plot was an unbearable jumble. One minute, the audience watched pickpocket Miloslavskaya recite poetry for a party; the next, it suffered through a garbled scene of drunken tomfoolery. Transitions were completely lacking, which left performers charging through scenes as if they were walking through a swamp, focused only on getting out.
In his playbill note, junior dramaturg Jordan Sucher emphasizes the “machinery of society” as a construct in the play; however, while there are symbols of a totalitarian regime (e.g. everyone wore white in the future, and movements, including greetings and kisses, were rigidly defined) everywhere, the atmosphere created was anything but. Again, the mess of a plot made it impossible to enjoy the show.
Bliss began with the illusions of time and choice resonating as clear themes meant to criticize philosophies that “encourage people to follow blindly without thinking for themselves and without justifying their own actions,” as Sucher says in the program, and had all the right components to be successful. But as a result of the inherently poor script, it disintegrated into a mind-numbingly vapid romance that made no substantial commentary on past, present, or future society and only offered true bliss when it ended.

Seven Guitars sounds like a painfully literal band name, but in this context it’s the School of Drama’s first main-stage production of the season.
Seven Guitars is a relevant and hyperlocal choice for this audience: It’s written by Pittsburgh-born playwright August Wilson and takes place in the Hill District circa 1948. The crew wastes no opportunity in capitalizing on the setting: The exceptional scenic design is fastidiously detailed, as School of Drama patrons have grown accustomed to seeing.
According to the program, the setting is “the backyard of 1727 Bedford Avenue,” but the scenic design crew ran wild with this barebones description. The setup is distinctly 3-D, featuring small, convincingly textured brick apartment buildings jutting out onto the stage. An herb garden packed with soil stretches toward the audience, and moss grows in the breaks between squares of concrete. A clothesline dips between buildings — sheer garments hanging by clothespins — illuminated from behind by the suggestion of a perpetually glowing distant sun.
As a caveat, the production is exceptionally long: Including the intermission, the performance clocks in at nearly three hours. If you’re viewing an 8 p.m. show, don’t count on being anywhere else until 11 p.m. or later.
In that respect, the producers might have done more to condense the play into a stage-suitable production. The scenes are not extraordinary in number, but they are long, featuring interchanges of rambling and seemingly trivial dialogue between characters. Seven Guitars is considered to be August Wilson’s ultimate artistic catharsis, and the characters’ mundane ruminations, while sometimes tiresome to watch, are important for developing characters and setting a historical time and place. But the shocking moments of the play — isolated spurts of violence — are set so far apart from each other that they lose some of their impact. An abridged version might have made for a more powerful production.
That said, protracted as they were, the actors’ performances were particularly outstanding, surpassing the School of Drama’s already high standard for student performance. The seven actors rose to the demands of incessant, expressive, dialect-heavy and quickly delivered dialogue, rarely appearing to falter.
Perhaps the performance of highest note is that of senior acting major Mitchell Edwards, who plays Floyd Barton. Floyd is an energetic, dreamy, sometimes violent character who grapples with his lot as a poor black musician on the cusp of a possible record deal in Chicago. Edwards seamlessly portrays both Floyd’s uncontainable energy and cheer and his moments of explosive frustration. 
His female companion and foil is reserved, skeptical Vera (played by senior acting major Johari Mackey), who finds comfort in menial, domestic tasks and constantly questions her loyalty to the historically unfaithful Floyd. Mackey conveys Vera’s more private nature but also delivers her character’s rare but stunning passionate outbursts in a quavering, but strong voice. Despite the shaky state of their characters’ relationship, the actors have an easy chemistry: Floyd is cheerful and affectionate, while Vera is more likely to brush him aside — impatient but quietly fond — while gardening or cooking.
Other performances are not to be overlooked, however. Each character has his or her moment in the spotlight, although some may be brief. Senior musical theatre major Harron Alexander as railing, distanced, unpredictable Hedley dreams aloud about being a “big man” with a carrying, lilting Creole accent. Senior musical theatre major Veladya Chapman is perfectly hysterical, mothering, and no-nonsense as Louise. And though she makes a late entrance, senior musical theatre major Alexis Floyd playing Louise’s niece Ruby makes her presence known, with her piercing voice, big-booty walk, and surprising emotional complexity. More minor characters Canewell (senior musical theatre major Jean Floradin) and Red Carter (senior musical theatre major Erron Crawford) are similarly dynamic, their portrayals fluid and colorful despite their supporting roles.
It’s important to note that the seven-person cast is entirely non-white. Though the audience isn’t privy to casting decisions or the pool from which actors are selected, it is a notable choice, especially considering that the program ruminates on colorblind casting. The cast works seamlessly together and spares us the suspension of disbelief involved in fitting a white actor into a non-white role.
Another surprising but important quality to all the actors is vocal talent. Vocal music is an integral component to Seven Guitars: The play begins and ends in song, and we hear every character’s voice, however briefly, at one point or another. It’s used as a vehicle for the emotional content of significant scenes. At the play’s beginning, Louise breaks the ice with a jokey, improvised tune. Later, Floyd offers a chilling, thought-stirring solo seated with his suddenly solemn friends. Hedley ends the play with a heartbreaking, voice-cracking repetition of a folk tune.
Seven Guitars is one of the best displays of sheer student skill you’ll see on the School of Drama stage, and it’s thought provoking to boot. Just be sure to bring a snack and a friend to supplement the long first act.

Gone Girl opens with the back of a blond head being caressed by a man’s hands. The head obviously belongs to a beautiful and elegant woman, resting on the chest of her loving and doting husband. Suddenly, the husband’s (Ben Affleck’s) thoughts are introduced via voice-over: “What are you thinking? How are you feeling? What have we done to each other?” These fundamental questions will undoubtedly haunt the rest of the film.
He keeps caressing the golden strands of his wife’s hair, as his thoughts turn darker: “I imagine cracking open her head, unspooling her brain, trying to get answers.” His wife (Rosamund Pike) turns to him with a look of concern, almost as if she has heard his thoughts as the screen fades to black and the unraveling of their marriage begins.
Based on Gillian Flynn’s novel, Gone Girl is about a wife who goes missing in the midst of a troubled marriage. The premise seems simple and intriguing, but Flynn dives into a story of dark complexity that’s drenched in tension and suspense —so much so that the novel has spent over 79 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list and has sold over 6 million copies. So when a film adaptation was announced with director David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network) aboard, many people were not only aware of the plot twists that the movie entails, but also held a certain set of expectations.
In short: The film definitely holds up. With the screenplay adapted by Gillian Flynn herself, the film is loyal to the plot of the novel while offering a deliciously slick account of a marriage gone horribly wrong as Nick Dunne (Affleck) finds his Missouri McMansion in carefully crafted disarray as his wife, Amy Elliot Dunne (Pike), is nowhere to be found. The film immediately alternates between the contradictory narratives of Nick and Amy, as Nick struggles to adjust to the national attention of his case while Amy details their tenuous marriage through her diary entries.
Fincher exhibits a superb craft in filmmaking. The film is slick and suspenseful, carefully building up in moments when we don’t know who’s guilty of what. The restrained ambience of the film heightens the audience’s fear that some characters are not as good as they seem, as they meticulously mask their more depraved selves from the public.
Fincher and Flynn understand and show that Gone Girl is more than a murder mystery. It presents a distorted view that crushes the overly idyllic and abstract idea of marriage.
Of course, marriage is hard, hard work. In marriage, you are annoyed with or may even resent your spouse, but spouses have to learn to work and even fight productively. 
Through the ups and downs, husband and wife will be able to make it work and love each other even more as they get to know each other more. Marriage turns many spouses into better people; for Nick and Amy Dunne, that’s not the case. The more they resent each other, the less they realize they know each other. Gone Girl dissects the marriage of two inherently selfish people and, despite whether they are inherently good or evil, they were meant for each other.
‘Til death do they part.

While I’ve written about celebrity fashion multiple times, I usually write about being inspired by stars’ styles in general, rather than their specific pieces of clothing. Sometimes, however, stars wear outfits that are so lovely that we just have to copy them. Not all of us can buy the exact same clothes as celebrities, so the best thing we can do is find outfits that are really similar. Luckily for us, most stores copy styles similar to what celebrities wear, so it isn’t difficult to imitate their styles. Here are a few ideas for how to get some popular celebrities’ styles for less!
Here’s a jacket worn by Emma Watson, who has recently gained a lot of attention for making a speech about gender equality for the UN General Assembly as a UN Ambassador.
The outfits that she makes using this jacket are typical of Watson’s polished and classic, yet somewhat edgy, style. For instance, she has paired a similar jacket with a simple black skirt from the brand Theory, a cashmere sweater from the brand Equipment, black tights, and short black boots from the brand 3.1 Phillip Lim. She has used the black leather jacket as the statement piece of her outfit, along with a simple gold pendant necklace. While the brand of Watson’s leather jacket is unknown, a jacket with a similar fit and belt can be found at Topshop for $136. A gray sweater or a nice blouse can be bought anywhere, such as H&M or Forever 21. And the same goes for a black mini skirt, since this is a basic piece that most stores should carry. As for black boots, 3.1 Phillip Lim ones that Watson wears are approximately $525, but Lucky Brand’s ‘Bartalino’ Stud Embossed Leather Booties are only $99.95 and are about the same.
Another notable celebrity who has been relatively scandal-free and known for her incredible style is Blake Lively. She’s best known for being one of the stars on Gossip Girl, but is currently better known for her interest in fashion and lifestyle. Her style on a day-to-day basis can be described as Bohemian-chic, and is illustrated by the outfit to the right.
This outfit can be dressed up or dressed down, and like Emma Watson’s outfit, can be copied with just a few basics. The loose-fitted white T-shirt can be found anywhere, but the pants are the statement piece of the outfit. Grab yourself a pair of printed pants from Free People, such as the Star Crossed Crop Pant for $98. Pair these pieces with a pair of black ballet flats to dress the outfit down or black heels to dress it up, and you’re good to go!
Although the Kardashians are pretty unpopular among most people, one of the younger members of the family, Kendall Jenner, is well known for her fashion. She has modeled in Fashion Weeks around the world, has her own fashion line with her sister Kylie, and sometimes appears in the well-known TV show Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Jenner’s style is also very simple and polished. 
Jenner has a classic black leather jacket; ou can find a similar one from Topshop for only $110, which is relatively less than what Jenner’s original would cost. A fitted gray T-shirt and dark skinny jeans can complete the look, but the main pieces in her outfit are the shoes. She has worn printed ballet flats that add interest to her outfit, as well as 3.1 Phillip Lim calf hair flats, which are approximately $142. Compare that to the BP ‘Moveover’ Pointy Toe flat from Nordstrom for only $59.95, which looks exactly the same, and you could get this look for much less.
As you can see, most celebrity styles consist of basic pieces that can be found anywhere, with one statement piece for which a cheaper copy is easily accessible. For this reason, copying a celebrity’s style is a great way to spice up your wardrobe without spending too much, since you probably have basic pieces. Just buying one new item of clothing can create a whole new look.

The idea of dessert is billed as an afterthought — “oh and by the way here’s some cake” — and actually is anything but. It’s impressive to make an elaborate dinner, don’t get me wrong. But the true measure of becoming a chef, a true cook, worthy of the jealousy of your peers and the envy of your exes, is literally being able to put the icing on the cake and serve them a dessert.
By this time in our lives, no longer are chocolate chips and brownies considered to be the measure of success. Instead we turn to other desserts, more sophisticated, more complicated, more daring. We turn to soufflés.
Chocolate Caramel Soufflé
This is the kind of recipe that you only stumble upon every few years. The kind that redefines what decadence means to you. The kind that will make you realize that you are, without a doubt, the classiest, most talented chef in this kitchen. It’s rich, it’s smooth, and it’s damn impressive. Have at it.
1/3 cup of sugar, plus at least another 1/4 cup for sprinkling
1 tablespoon of butter, melted
1/2 cup of chocolate (this can be fancy, expensive European chocolate or plain old Nestlé chips)
3 egg yolks
6 egg whites (I know, I know, extra egg yolks)
Caramel sauce
Note: To really and truly make soufflés, you must have ramekins (four to six). These are tiny, ceramic dishes that will yield the most beautiful, airy soufflés you have ever seen. You owe it to yourself to have a set anyway, so just suck it up and buy some.
1) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
2) Time to coat the ramekins: Swab them with butter, then put some sugar inside of them and shake them around to cover them entirely in both butter and sugar. I know it seems stupid, but actually, it’s not. The mix will guarantee that the soufflés rise evenly and smoothly, thus creating perfect soufflés.
3) Melt your chocolate. Do not do this by sticking it in a microwave. Instead, try a double boiler technique: Start by boiling some water in a pan. Put the chocolate into a glass bowl, then hold the bowl above the boiling water until the chocolate starts to melt. From there, stir until the chocolate is liquidy and smooth.
4) Remove the chocolate from the heat and then stir in the egg yolks. Set aside.
5) Beat the egg whites in a mixer until they start to form peaks (a fancy way of saying that their texture starts to change). This will literally feel like it is taking forever. Just stay calm. Start adding the 1/3 cup of sugar slowly, a little bit at a time, until stiff peaks are formed. This will look like meringue. 
6) Pour the chocolate mixture slowly into the egg whites. Fold it in gently. 
7) Distribute the mixture among the ramekins. Before you bake them, run your finger over the edge. They’ll rise better if you smooth out the top.
8) Bake them for about 25 minutes, or until they’ve risen but are still wiggly in the center.
9) Let them cool, then take a spoon and carve a little out of the center. Pour some caramel sauce into the center and then put the cap back on. 
10) Consume, then die of self-appreciation.

Dear Evan,
One of my best friends plays Chaser on the university’s Quidditch team, but only because she didn’t make Snitch last year. She’s been training nonstop — literally every day since then, she’s been painting herself gold and running laps around the football field in her underwear — tryouts are next week so she’s been having me time her laps and pelt her with dodge balls — does the Snitch even get pelted during real games?
But she’s not going to get the position — she runs like a wounded hippogriff, and I can’t count on two hands and feet the number of times I’ve scored headshots. How do I let her down slow and make sure she doesn’t go about the same training regimen (or worse) this year?
Miserably,
Mostly Offish and Reclusive, Except Obliging Friends and Associates, Regretting Ever Disclosing Will to Assist Lucy with Life’s Fierce Aspiration to run Naked
Dear MORE OF A REDWALL FAN,
Oh, you won’t be able to do both. Let her down slow and discourage her from trying again, I mean. From personal experience, avid (a mild adjective, considering their vehemence) Harry Potter fans, particularly those who go so far as to act out events from the books, like Quidditch players or LARPing cosplayers, have tendencies toward the stubborn and the dramatic.
If you value your time and sanity, I’d skip going easy on her and jump straight to telling her flat-out that she’s slow as balls and that she should stick to spending Saturdays failing to solve New York Times crosswords.
RIP Brian Jacques (pronounced “Jakes,” apparently),
Evan Kahn
Dear Evan,
I always leave my dishes in the sink to do later, but then I forget to wash them, so my roommates get mad at me. But I really don’t want to do the dishes. Help?
Lazily yours,
Sometimes Consume Unpretentious Meals But, Under Constraints, Kip Ere Tidying
Dear SCUM BUCKET,
Just make it look like you’ve washed your plates and water glasses. Silverware is easy — just swipe your fork with a soapy sponge once, and you’re fine. The trick is to put in absolutely no effort.
I hope my roommates don’t think I do this…
Evan Kahn

If you’re into seeing a movie about monkeys taking over the world, then I figure you would let a toddler cut your hair or learn English from Sofia Vergara. But such a seemingly laughable premise as that seen in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes can always be redeemed with an unfathomable amount of CGI. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’s apes fall between 2001: A Space Odyssey chimps and Curious George — meaning the monkeys in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes are so realistically unreal the viewer may not be able to connect to the apes, which lengthens the already time-consuming movie. However, with that said, the movie is able to maintain the appearance of a thought-out and organized symphony of moving parts. In conjunction with the actors, the apes turn out to deliver great performances, interacting with humans and a post-apocalyptic setting. As a follow up to the reboot of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a solid film worth seeing that will make you leave McConomy saying, “Yeah, they’ll make a third one.”
Continuing this week’s theme of sequels, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is playing this Saturday. Three words: action, drama, and muscles. Unlike the first movie (and most sequels out now), this movie jumps ahead almost 70 years into the future. It starts out kind of where The Avengers left off, but that does not automatically exclude people who have not seen the epic movie involving most of Marvel’s popular superheroes. (Sorry Green Lantern’s Ryan Reynolds, you didn’t make the cut.) This shield-toting superhero sequel doesn’t require the viewer to have seen the original. Many new characters (and bromances) are introduced, as well as old recognizable characters. Like any Marvel superhero movie, the action is superb. Between the car chases, awesome shield-swinging skillz (yes, with a “z”), and fighting sequences, this movie really solidifies the superhero genre as one to be taken seriously.

Well, let’s hope he finally got it out of his system.
Thom Yorke’s solo work and work with Atoms for Peace (which you could call another Yorke solo project) have always reminded me of creators that came out of warp records in the late ’90s.
Being a long time Radiohead fanboy, I have a love/hate relationship with Yorke’s solo work — in that I love it on its own but hate its influence on Radiohead’s more recent albums.
Yorke’s new album Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes makes me think the sound that Yorke has been chasing ever since Kid A has finally come to life. Odd time signatures complemented by atmospheric and spacious vocal melodies dominate the album.
If you’re a fan of Bonoboo, ambient Aphex twin, or even SBTRKT, I would give this album a listen.

Over 500 students, faculty, and community members participated in the sixth annual Donut Dash on Sunday, a yearly event held by the brothers of Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE).
Junior cognitive science major June Hammer Walitzer took first place in the women’s singles division, and undeclared Mellon College of Science first-year Joey Pickens took first in the men’s singles division and overall with a time of 12:36.
For the past five years, the Donut Dash looked much like those held by other organizations around the country: run, eat some donuts, run more, and try not to puke. But this year’s Dash was transformed, thanks to a makeover from senior cognitive science and human-computer interaction double major Jeff Mich.
“Whenever anyone asks me what the difference is between this year’s Dash and last year’s, I cut them off,” Mich said. “We’re doing everything differently. We’ve rebuilt the event from the foundation.”
To make that dream a reality, Mich worked with coordinator of Greek leadership and SAE chapter adviser Emily Cunningham.
“Last year, I was really taken aback by the quirkiness of the chapter and the event,” Cunningham said. “It’s weird, it’s so weird, but it’s so them. I love seeing their passion and how they can make this goofy thing so great, so I wanted to help make it a reality.”
Though in the past the event raised money for the Children’s Hospital, a charity with which Mich said the fraternity had a great relationship, this year, the money raised at the event is going to Live Like Lou, a Pittsburgh-based organization that is focused not only on funding research to find a cure for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig’s disease, but on helping patients and their families by providing support and care to create a community for those affected by the disease.
Neil Alexander, the founder of Live Like Lou, spoke at the end of the event, saying he was impressed with this year’s Donut Dash.
“Six months ago, we received a phone call from SAE asking if they could work with us for Donut Dash ... which we thought was just about the best idea we’ve ever heard in our entire lives. This is an impressive group of young men,” Alexander said.
According to Mich, the change was spurred on when the house’s alumni adviser, Bob Dax, was diagnosed with ALS last year. Knowing that the disease is fast-paced, the brothers decided to honor Dax by dedicating their annual fall charity to Live Like Lou.
“I’ve seen firsthand how invaluable Dax is to the house. He is the reason that we are still on campus, the reason that our house is filled with as many great guys and strong leaders as we are. Somebody needed to step up to show him how much he means to us,” Mich said.
“[Dax] is truly the example of the SAE True Gentleman,” Alexander said at the event.
In 2013, roughly 64 people were responsible for the majority of the fraternity’s $22,000 funding.
“We could do better; we could do so much better. That’s not a sustainable effort, and it’s not fair to our donors. They were investing in us, and it was our responsibility to show them what that money could do — not only on a college campus, but in a community,” Mich said.
Cunningham was impressed with the fraternity’s efforts and organization, saying, “Their passion, drive, and emotion that has gone into making this happen says a lot about these men and how deeply they understand brotherhood and what that means. They are truly incredible men who have truly pushed the boundaries and made things happen, and I don’t know how they’ve made as many things happen as they have.”
The fraternity raised $100,510.68, the largest sum raised by any organization on Carnegie Mellon’s campus, including collective events such as Greek Sing.
“[We] wanted to show this campus what it really means to fundraise. We care about this cause, and even though we don’t participate in a ton of stuff around campus, this is something that we’ve built a strong, growing foundation for. We don’t do things that don’t have a lasting impact. We’re setting the expectations for next year’s leaders,” Mich said.
According to Cunningham, the event has become so large that it caught the attention of Nigel Travis, the chief executive officer of Dunkin’ Donuts, who called the fraternity last week to thank them for placing the largest order ever — 9,000 donuts. Dax, who attended the event, said that he was blown away by the fraternity’s efforts.
“I’m overwhelmed. I can’t say enough. I never expected anything like this, especially compared to last year. This is mind-bogglingly amazing,” Dax said.
Though Mich does not hold an official leadership role in the fraternity, he said he was determined to make Donut Dash a major event on campus by “putting the amount of work that was required and having a desire to do things for the event.”
As project manager for the event, Mich was responsible for the growth of the event: the food trucks (Mac & Gold and Franktuary), the live music from WISH 99.7, the donut decorating station, the community connections, and the corporate sponsorships, ranging from People’s Natural Gas to The Brew Gentlemen Beer Company.
Cunningham said that she did not do much at all, but rather served as an adviser to help the men.
“It’s so rewarding to see that so many men are working together to make things happen,” Cunningham said. “You don’t see that delegation very often, but that is truly what fraternity is and should be: to give others leadership opportunities and to work together and to be wholly invested in this as a chapter event.”
“I believe that any work that I do, personal or academic, I try to get the most out of it,” Mich said. “That sort of started with [David] Kosbie’s class, when the final project was about doing something real and influential instead of just making a great game. Whenever I’m faced with a problem, I want the solution to be the most beneficial to me and the community. Donut Dash was the perfect fit.”

“America’s conversation on race has only just begun,” said NPR correspondent Michele Norris during a talk on racial diversity last Wednesday at the Carnegie Music Hall. The lecture, titled “Eavesdropping on America’s Conversation On Race,” proved more than an exercise in listening, and rather an invitation to an open dialogue on race in America. Hosted by the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, the event was held in tandem with the museum’s new exhibit “Race: Are We So Different?”
Michele Norris began hosting NPR’s All Things Considered after working for news outlets such as The Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune, and the Los Angeles Times, eventually winning both an Emmy and Peabody Award for her coverage of the Sept. 11 terror attacks in conjunction with ABC News.
In 2006, Norris was inspired by the term “post-racial” to explore the real conversations Americans were having about race. Today, Norris directs her social experiment, “The Race Card Project.” 
People from America and elsewhere may send in their six-word stories about their experiences with race to the “Project.” More often than not, Norris finds people are eager to share many of their anecdotes.
At her lecture on Wednesday, Norris shared some of the accounts she’s heard while directing “The Race Card Project.” 
Once, a woman revealed she had saved an invitation to a lynching that was sent to her father. In a more intimate moment, Norris recalled learning that her own father had been shot in Birmingham, Alabama after serving in WWII. While still in uniform, her father attempted to enter a center where he was taking a class on the Constitution but was stopped by a police officer. A scuffle ensued, and the officer attempted to shoot her father. Luckily, he escaped with only a flesh wound.
Norris’ father, however, never told her about this experience. Instead, she said, he decided “to pass on ambition” to his children rather than a history of violence and oppression.
For Norris, these small moments of racial tension add up to create a person’s “wealth.” Norris proposed a new definition of wealth in relation to race. America’s “wealth” of diversity comes from these small ways we experience race, Norris said.
She said that although sometimes people’s words might sound harsh or off-putting, their curiosity to talk about race and diversity should be encouraged. Norris ended the lecture by reading some of the six-word “Race Card” stories she found funny or thought-provoking: “It’s a non-issue when aliens arrive,” “What ever happened to midnight basketball?,” “I am Asian, not a genius,” “Ghetto’s a place, not an adjective”, “Hated for being a white cop,” “Delicious ambiguity: the permanent in-betweener,” and “Still more work to be done” to name a few.
Norris’ own six-word story? “Fooled them all, not done yet.”
Many Carnegie Mellon community members who attended the lecture hope that projects like “The Race Card Project” inspire more campus dialogue on race. 
For Assistant Director in the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs Shernell Smith, conversations about diversity strengthen the Carnegie Mellon community: “Food, festivals, and fairs only get you so far,” Smith said. “With the unanswered questions in the room — or the elephant in the room — these kinds of dialogues allow for us to dig a little bit deeper and really have those meaningful exchanges with one another. Because those meaningful relationships are about collaboration.... As President Subresh said earlier this week, ‘Diversity inspires innovation.’ And Carnegie Mellon is filled with innovation.”
“She really included a lot of multicultural issues; she hit on Asian ethnicities, Hispanic ethnicities, blacks, whites. I even like how she mentioned how whites are sometimes underprivileged because of the inability to say certain things that colored people can,” sophomore English major Melanie Diaz said.
For others, the lecture sparked some more critical thoughts on Carnegie Mellon’s relationship with race.
“CMU has a huge problem in that we not only devalue the humanities, but we pretend that science and technology are these holy grails of objectivity, when science and technology, in both education and application, both have a huge history of racism and sexism,” junior chemistry and creative writing double major Sophie Zucker said. “How can we call science and technology today not racist and sexist when 60 years ago we were saying that racial differences indicated intelligence?”
Others found the lecture’s tone fresh and hopeful.
“It wasn’t just ‘let’s acknowledge that race issues are alive,’ ” said the secretary of the Black Graduate Students Organization and mechanical engineering doctoral candidate Nateé Johnson. “It was also ‘Hey, let’s be comfortable in our own skin while recognizing that it’s not that different from someone else’s.’ We are naturally curious beings. We’re evolved to notice differences.… We don’t have to let stereotypes dictate how we treat people, or how we perceive people are treating us. This race conversation doesn’t have to be abrasive.”

“Today we honor Carnegie Mellon’s best-kept secret: our incredible staff. Simply the finest, most hardest working, and most dedicated staff in the world,” said Cohon University Center Administrator Stanley Krowitz at the 20th annual Andy Awards.
The Andy Awards, held on Sept. 30, honor faculty and staff from all over campus for outstanding performance and contributions to the campus community.
The ceremony began with a speech from President Subra Suresh that emphasized the importance of the behind-the-scenes work that the university’s staff performs.
“[The staff members] are the unsung heroes of the enterprise,” Suresh said. “That’s why I personally believe that something like the Andy Awards are so critical.”
Suresh also stressed the value of the university staff’s creative contributions, no matter their size.
“What people don’t realize is that innovations ... happen every day. Very small innovations, from a practical sense, can be much more impactful,” Suresh said. “We put a man on the moon before we put wheels on the suitcase.”
The first awards for Years of Service were presented by Pattye Stragar, staff council chair and fitness operations manager in the department of athletics.
“Win or lose, you represent the best that the staff has to offer,” Stragar said. “Your contributions are an example for all staff who work day in and day out to contribute to the campus community.”
Sixteen staff members were recognized for 30 years of service, nine for 35 years, and three for 40 years. Chuck Gitzen, storeroom manager for the physics department, was recognized for 45 years of service, and Joe Rudman, a scientific project administrator also in the physics department, was recognized for 55 years of service.
Next, Everett Tademy, assistant vice president for diversity and equal opportunity services, presented the Andy Award for Outstanding Dedication.
“These nominees have a can-do attitude and consistently do whatever it takes to overcome obstacles ... in order to accomplish their goals,” Tademy said of the winners. “Like Randy Pausch, they run through walls.”
The Outstanding Dedication Award was given to Gitzen. The Andy Awards website says of Gitzen, “Day in and day out, [Chuck] just gets the job done, no matter what it is. In everything he does, Chuck is committed to doing a quality job.”
The Andy Award for Outstanding Commitment to Students was presented by Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno.
“[The nominees] surpass their duties of their job description and understand the immediate as well as underlying needs of our students” said Casalegno. “Staff at this institution express an investment in learning about the whole student, through understanding students’ values, their ambitions, their aspirations, and what motivates them to learn and contribute to the broader community.”
The award was given to Rubab Jafry O’Connor (HNZ ‘05), an academic adviser in the Tepper School of Business.
Mary Ann Blair, director of information security, presented the award for Outstanding Innovation.
“As individuals, teams, and community members, people in this room continually invent and adapt,” Blair said.
The award was given to Treshea Wade (HNZ ’14), the sole nominee and assistant director of alumni relations in the Tepper School of Business.
“An incredibly hard worker, [Wade] has earned a reputation for her imagination, creativity and innovative ideas especially related to online communication with alumni and social media” according to the Andy Awards website.
The Andy Award for Outstanding Culture was awarded to Diane Stidle, the graduate programs manager in the School of Computer Science’s Machine Learning Department. According to the Andy Awards Website, the award for Outstanding Culture recognizes those who “foster a balanced and inclusive workplace” and “bring out the best in each individual and organization.”
Vice President for Campus Affairs Michael Murphy presented the Andy Award for Outstanding University Citizenship.
“The Andy Award for Outstanding University Citizenship honors those who have made important contributions that benefit the entire university community,” Murphy said. “These individuals have committed their time and energy to working with others to improve and enhance Carnegie Mellon as a whole.”
The Outstanding University Citizenship award went to Rudman. According to the Andy Awards website, “Over the years, the name Joe Rudman has been synonymous with caring and commitment.... He makes people around him better than they would have been, and he never gives up on those in whom he believes.”
The last award was for Outstanding Community Contributions, and was presented by Krowitz.
“Nominees for the Andy Award for Outstanding Community Contributions are those individuals who tirelessly devote themselves to enhancing the living, learning and working experience of the campus community,” Krowitz said. “Through their words and actions, they go above and beyond every single day in every single way.”
The award was given to Leon “Pete” Smith and William Taylor of the Leonard Gelfand Center for Service Learning and Outreach Drivers Team. Smith and Taylor drive the buses used for education outreach by campus members.
“I’m so excited; it’s wonderful. I’m so thankful that they recognized what we do,” Taylor said. “My mother said if you do something, do it good, and that’s all I can do.”

Last week, the university announced that Henry Hillman donated $5 million to Carnegie Mellon’s nascent BrainHub initiative.
Hillman, referred to in a campus-wide email as a “renowned Pittsburgh philanthropist,” has donated funds to Carnegie Mellon in the past to support the construction of the Hillman Center for Future-Generation Technologies.
“The Hillman gift will provide new endowment funds to help support presidential graduate fellowships in areas broadly connected to brain research,” the email said. “It will also provide seed grants, through CMU’s ProSEED program, for innovative research projects that will connect faculty from disciplines across CMU.”
The Henry L. Hillman Foundation, according to its website, is “dedicated to improving the quality of life in Pittsburgh and southwestern Pennsylvania.” Hillman inherited much of his money from his grandfather, a Pittsburgh steel tycoon and the founder of the Pittsburgh Coke & Chemical Company, according to Business Insider.
“Understanding how the brain works is among the great challenges of the 21st century, with results that promise to improve human health and well-being in dramatic ways,” said President Subra Suresh in a press release. “Carnegie Mellon can make a unique and distinctive contribution to this global effort by bringing together our strengths in neurobiology, computation, data sciences, human learning and behavioral science to create urgently needed research frameworks, tools and technologies, and by working in close concert with the network of BrainHub universities around the world.”
Carnegie Mellon launched the BrainHub initiative in late August; the initiative includes plans to expand Carnegie Mellon’s brain research in several different ways.
As part of the initiative, according to the initial press release on the subject, the university plans to hire 10 or more faculty specializing in brain research across various departments and fields. 
BrainHub will focus on developing better tools to measure neuron activity in the brain and computational methods for analyzing brain activity to understand the link between activity in the brain and the body’s behavior. Hillman is one of many sources of funding for BrainHub. According to the press release on BrainHub, Carnegie Mellon has secured $75 million in initial commitments from organizations like the R.K. Mellon Foundation; Dietrich Foundation;  Kris Gopalakrishnan, co-founder of business consulting company Infosys; and others.
“The gift will help support the training of the next generation of brain researchers on a global scale,” the university press release says. “As part of BrainHub, Carnegie Mellon scientists will work with university partners from China, India and the United Kingdom, and the Hillman gift will be matched with other sources of support for BrainHub.”
BrainHub is meant to pave the way for new methods of measuring and analyzing brain activity, as Carnegie Mellon scientists work with other top brain researchers.
Some of BrainHub’s global partners include the University of Warwick, which has expertise in the field of digital health; Sun Yat-sen University, whose medical school is clinically experienced with autism and Alzheimer’s; Oxford University and its International Brain Mechanics and Trauma Lab; and the Indian Institute of Science, which has its own brain research center.

Ex officio report
Director of Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation Joshua Centor provided a report on the state of university athletics and the Jared L. Cohon University Center (CUC) expansion, highlighting that there were 70 student athletes with a 4.0 QPA last fall and 58 with a perfect QPA in the spring. Overall, the student athlete QPA statistics are on par with those of the rest of the campus community, and 109 athletes received the distinction of “All American” last year.
There are currently 18 varsity sports. The most recent addition is women’s golf. There is approximately the same number of club athletes as varsity athletes. One recent change is that club coaches are now being paid by the university as employees, with their salaries coming through the athletics department. Centor also discussed plans for renovating Skibo Gymnasium and  putting  a new athletic facility in the CUC, expected to be completed in 2016.
Committee update: Senate Week
For Senate Week, student representatives will be giving out Senate-branded merchandise to interested students and selling T-shirts for five dollars to the campus community.
Senate members will be tabling outside of Merson Courtyard 10 a.m.–2 p.m., Oct. 6–10 and will be encouraging students to “like” the Student Senate Facebook page as well as fill out surveys regarding stress culture, the use of activity fees, the possibility of a smoke-free campus, and sexual assault policies.

It quietly slipped by, unnoticed, lost in the turmoil of the ISIS crisis — the 50th anniversary of President Lyndon Johnson’s “War on Poverty” speech. Fifty years ago, Johnson verbally recognized the problem of cyclical poverty and, in addition to giving the issue national attention, he started several means-tested welfare programs designed to turn what he called “taxeaters” into “taxpayers.” In other words, the War on Poverty was supposed to help people achieve self-sustenance, welfare programs would eventually be phased out, and prosperity would be achieved.
Since the war on poverty started, America has spent $22 trillion on means-tested welfare programs in constant 2012 dollars. Yet we’ve made minimal progress. When LBJ left office in 1969, the poverty rate sat at about 13 percent; Now it’s 15 percent.
It seems impossible that we can spend $22 trillion over 50 years and still have 15 percent of the country living in poverty. That’s because it actually is impossible. According to a recent Heritage Foundation report, 75 percent of those deemed to be living in poverty have a car. Thirty one percent of the impoverished have two cars, two-thirds have cable TV, more than half have video game systems, and 40 percent have wide-screen LCD TVs.
When we think about poverty, we think about not having enough food to feed a family or sustain one’s own health. We think about homelessness and the kind of material deprivation that nobody in a country as wealthy as the United States should have to face. Turns out, only two percent of those in poverty are homeless, and, according to the Department of Agriculture, impoverished children and upper-middle class children have an identical intake of protein and vitamins. The overwhelming majority of those in poverty reported that they were not hungry for a single day during the prior year.
Though there are people in this country who do face the type of material deprivation we associate with poverty, the problem isn’t as widespread as we think — the 15 percent figure is certainly misleading. That $22 trillion that we’ve spent on eradicating poverty has actually just bolstered the lifestyles of those with yearly earnings that place them in the impoverished income bracket.
If that’s a decision that we want to make, then that’s one thing, but such raw wealth redistribution seems to intuitively run counter to the American ethos. As LBJ originally described the War on Poverty, the goal was to turn “taxeaters” into “taxpayers.” By that measure, the War on Poverty has failed miserably. We have a nearly identical percentage of the country in the impoverished income bracket, and welfare spending in chained 2012 dollars is now 20 times what it was when LBJ left office.
Fortunately, we already spend a lot of money on these means-tested welfare programs. Rather than gutting the programs or looking for more funding, all we have to do to fix this issue is restructure the administration of these resources. That way they can help people become self-sufficient. There are all kinds of plausible ideas for welfare programs out there, many of which are now suggesting that local governments would be best equipped to handle the war on poverty, as they’re intimately familiar with the problems of their constituents.
To reflect this at a policy level, the federal government would restructure means-tested welfare spending as a state grant. States that opt in would be given the federal money that would have gone toward traditional means-tested welfare programs. The states would then experiment and see which anti-poverty measures work best. 
Similar plans have been suggested in the past, and while they haven’t been perfect, they still came close to achieving the original aims of the War on Poverty. In order to actually lift people up into true, self-ordained prosperity, we need to restructure federally appointed welfare spending. Hopefully the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty will give us cause to reflect on the past and commit to positive change for the future.

Climate change is a hot-button topic, as it should be, with bitter divisions over its impact and implications for the future. With all the media buzz, it’s easy to dismiss it as clickbait and journalistic hyperbole. However, global warming is still an exceedingly serious issue, and should be treated as such.
The European Space Agency released a report just last week from the GOCE (Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer), detailing its findings on how the loss of ice from Western Antarctica between 2009 and 2012 has caused a dip in the gravitational field in the region. Dips in gravity aren’t abnormal, but usually those dips take place slowly, over thousands of years, according to Discovery News.
While scientists do not yet know the direct impact such rapid changes in gravity will have, the fact remains: Climate change is now altering the way fundamental laws of our planet work, laws that have governed our environment for millions of years.
According to a Stanford University study funded by the National Science Foundation, climate change is causing unprecedented drought in California. Scientific American predicts that the desert climate of the Sahara will begin pushing northward; southern Europe is already experiencing intense droughts. Whether or not people want to accept climate change as a problem, it is.
It’s important to separate political ideology from scientific fact. There is no question that climate change is a rapidly escalating problem. To deny this fact is, simply put, scientifically misguided. Of course, it is easy to become overwhelmed by the sheer size of the problem, to feel lost in the crush of dire circumstance. 
However, people should not look at every newly found environmental crisis as another sign that the world is coming to an end. Instead, people should look at each new piece of information as a personal call to action, an impetus to change the way we look at, and interact with, the environmental world.

California just experienced a wave of progressive legislation signed into law last week, briefly becoming a stronghold of legislative efficiency while most of the country’s governments are stuck in gridlock. Governor Jerry Brown has now signed bills into law that address sexual consent on college campuses, eliminate the “gay panic” defense in cases of LGBTQ hate crimes, and ban single-use plastic bags.
With growing discussion and debate regarding sexual assault on college campuses, the “Yes Means Yes” law is the first of its kind to be passed by a state, defining consent as “affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement" and requiring colleges to provide sexual assault victims with confidential report opportunities, counseling, and access to an advocate. The provision of these 
resources is tied to state funding for student financial aid.
In addition to the passing of this affirmative consent law, California passed a law eliminating the “gay panic” and “trans panic” defenses which have been used in court cases to reduce sentences. Previously, these defenses have been used in assault cases against gay or transgender people to claim that the assailant was too shocked by discovering the victim was transgender or gay to be held fully responsible for their actions. 
Thankfully, homophobic and transphobic defenses will no longer be accepted in California, a standard other states should certainly adopt.
In terms of environmental issues, this recent display of legislative action has also banned the distribution of single-use plastic bags by grocery stores and pharmacies, and implements a 10-cent charge for plastic or compostable bags. Liquor stores and convenience stores will be affected by this ban in one year, and the 10-cent charge can only be used by stores to cover costs associated with complying with this new law. Plastic bags are a significant contributor to environmental damage, and this move should help curb the devastating ecological impacts of their overuse.
While much of the country is facing a painfully unproductive legislative season, California has become a small beacon of hope in successfully passing a number of progressive pieces of legislation. 
We can only hope that other states, and our federal government, will take similar steps in the near 
future.

On Sept. 30, a man in Texas who had recently traveled to Liberia was diagnosed with the first documented case of Ebola in the United States, heightening previous worries about the disease that erupted after ebola-infected missionaries were flown home from West Africa this summer.
However, in a country with a well-established healthcare system and access to basic sanitary necessities, there is little need to worry that the appearance of the disease in America could become a widespread epidemic. 
Unlike Liberia and other West African nations, the United States has measures in place to prevent the rapid spread of a disease like Ebola. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for example, can identify and monitor people who came into contact with the Texan to ensure that the disease does not spread further than already infected individuals.
Additionally, the disease is not airborne; it can only be spread through direct contact with bodily fluids from infected individuals. Once a person is identified as having Ebola, it is easy for the CDC and doctors to contain the patient and, effectively, the disease. The disease can also be killed by cleaners and other sanitizers.
Ebola has become widespread in other nations because of a lack of similar, already-established response networks like the CDC and America’s vast hospital network, as well as limited access to sanitizing products. Without these resources, it is difficult for people  to treat those infected  in a sanitary way that will not infect caregivers and, in turn, those they interact with.
While the spread of Ebola is a true concern in other nations with less developed healthcare systems, the spread of the disease in America is something that should be of relatively little concern to citizens. This is especially true when one considers that the likelihood of being killed by food poisoning or partying too hard is greater than the likelihood of dying from Ebola in America, according to Newsweek. So don’t sweat Ebola, fellow Americans — at least for now.

For the last few years, Hong Kong has readied itself for the ongoing debate and protests that have raged through the city’s business district of Central.
Occupy Central, a movement dedicated to civil disobedience and organized by professors, lawyers and members of the clergy, was already hyped up last summer. Many writers and witnesses have referenced the Tiananmen Massacre and the tragedy that unfolded during China’s last large civil disobedience occupation. However, it is important to note that while the possibility of a crackdown is not negligible, China faces a unique set of constraints from the international community that limits its hand. Last time, China was in the midst of its “dark ages,” not the economic juggernaut it is today.
A sudden change in tactic on the part of the Hong Kong government reveals the new approach being implemented by Beijing and Hong Kong. A week ago, video footage of crackdowns on violent protesters showed tear gas canisters being hurled into large crowds. As a Hong Kong resident myself, it never would have crossed my mind that extreme political unrest reminiscent of the Arab Spring was occurring in Hong Kong.
It is important for people to know about the events unfolding in Hong Kong, a city that has long served as the bridge from Eastern to Western worlds. While the bulk of China’s population lives below or on the poverty line, Hong Kong’s citizens enjoy a much higher standard of life, equal to that of the United Kingdom or Iceland. 
Additionally, the future of the small territory offers valuable insight into the future of China. The way in which China reacts in the coming weeks, apart from its expected condemnation of the protests, will give hints of China’s long term political future. 
As a student from Hong Kong, I am often asked what Hong Kong actually is. Is it an independent city-state like Singapore? I always reply with “it’s part of China, but Hong Kong keeps a separate government.”
This is officially called the one-country, two-systems government as outlined in the Basic Law, the de facto constitution of Hong Kong. The Basic Law was written when Hong Kong transitioned from British colony to reclaimed special administrative region of China. As a result of this history, Hong Kong was once a prized possession of both Britain and China. It served as the gateway for the Chinese to sell their goods and for the British to gain access to the lucrative, emergent markets in China. However, the rise of Shanghai as China’s own financial hub in the last decade or so has dimmed Hong Kong’s importance. While Hong Kong remains a major city that many corporations focus their operations on, it is not as indispensable as it used to be.
The Basic Law also guaranteed Hong Kong a large amount of autonomy in affairs not concerned with national defense or foreign diplomacy. This autonomy formerly meant that Hong Kong would be able to hold its own elections in 2017. Each citizen would receive one vote, and candidates would be nominated from Hong Kong by the Hong Kong people. This was the vision many Hong Kong citizens had harbored. However, the Chinese government disagrees, and released a statement over the summer saying it would only allow Hong Kong elections under the condition that the candidates be approved by the mainland. Clearly, “universal suffrage” isn’t very universal in the Chinese government’s vision.
Hong Kong has prized itself on being Asia’s “World City.” Although competition may have diminished the city in terms of economic might, it remains a pearl that has been long prized by both Eastern and Western cultures. As a result, it prides itself on being Asia’s best place to live, work, or do business. It has accomplished this all under the one-country, two-systems rule. Many people recognize this and are proud of this fact, and consequently, economic progress for them also means political progress — specifically, democratization.
Many critics in Hong Kong and China point out that Hong Kong already enjoys a high degree of autonomy and should not be complaining. But changes in China’s hierarchy, as well as their plan to “allow” universal suffrage point to the fact that Hong Kong may be going backward in terms of political organization. 
Xi Jinping, China’s new president, has been shown to be a strong, decisive leader and is very much focused on a consolidated, executive office in China. His quick movement to dismantle the corrupted elite offices in China, as demonstrated by the capture of Zhou Yongkang over the summer, paints a picture of a powerful and determined leader. Recognizing this, the people of Hong Kong fear that the elements that made Hong Kong so dynamic may soon disappear, especially as China tightens its grip around the city. 
Going forward may be a tall order, but in the eyes of Hong Kong citizens, the Umbrella Revolution is the only thing stopping them from sliding back down.

How often do you find yourself asking for a plastic bag at Entropy+? Does the fee of a few cents change your mind about using plastic bags? Taxes need to hit a certain pain level to actually change behavior and since taxes do not always call for immediate action, statewide bans on plastic bags may be necessary. Last week, California became the first state to ban plastic bags  officially — a model for other states.
Over the past few years, a handful of local and city governments have been successful in implementing a plastic bag tax or even a ban on plastic shopping bags altogether. San Francisco was the first major city to ban plastic bags in 2007. 
This ban led other local governments to follow its model. Seattle, for example, prohibits retail stores from providing customers with single-use plastic carry-out shopping bags. Retail stores are allowed to provide any size recyclable paper or reusable bags, but they must charge 5 cents for paper carry-out bags of a large enough size.
Increasingly, more local governments have been following these examples, but there has not been a statewide ban on plastic bags until now. The California ban will go into effect from 2015 through 2016. This statewide ban should be a powerful way to push people to use fewer plastic bags and encourage them to use reusable ones.
Environmental activists have pushed for plastic bag bans for years, as these bags create mountains of trash that are difficult to recycle. In addition, plastic bag manufacturers use energy and nonrenewable resources like oil. The use of plastic bags isn’t the only problem; their creation also harms the environment.
However, it has been difficult to pass a statewide ban because plastic bags are cheaper for businesses to use than paper bags. According to Cathy Browne, a general manager at a California plastic bag manufacturer, the banning of plastic bags will lead to layoffs in companies such as hers. In response, Democratic California governor Jerry Brown stated that the ban will be “closing the loop on the plastic waste stream, all while maintaining — and growing — California jobs.”
Even within the community of environmentalists, there are disagreements on the ban of plastic bags. There are people who oppose banning plastic bags and suggest that a tax is the better alternative. One of the main arguments against the ban is that plastic bags are very low in priority when all environmental issues are considered. Nevertheless, encouraging small, environmentally positive changes is a step. It may or may not make a giant impact right away, but it is, in fact, a step.
For those cities that do not have plastic bag bans, it is not difficult to make the more environmentally-friendly choice on an individual level. You can walk into any grocery or convenience store and find a display of reusable bags for sale. As students, we typically carry backpacks that can also be used to carry groceries. Make it a habit of bringing a reusable bag with you when you go grocery shopping. It is not a huge change to make,  but, in the company of many others, it will make a significant impact on the future of our environment.

Microsoft has always been a risk taker with its products, often releasing them to the market before they have been properly readied.
We have seen this time and time again with Windows Vista, the Surface line of products, and most recent prominent instance, Windows 8. After the Windows Vista disaster, Windows 7 came in to save the day. After several iterations of its Surface tablet, the new 12-inch Surface arrived as the product that Microsoft should have been producing all along. Windows 10 answers the complaints about Windows 8, an operating system that could not even manage to achieve a 15 percent adoption rate among Windows users.
As the market moved toward mobile devices, Microsoft became well aware that it needed to become more touchscreen friendly or die. However, releasing Windows 8 as a response to this trend was much too radical, plaguing mouse and keyboard users with large tiles and hidden menus that were clearly not optimal for their peripherals.
However, with Windows 10, Microsoft may have finally hit the nail on the head with its dream of “One Product Family, One Platform, and One Store.” They appear to have finally created an operating system that tailors to touchscreen users, while not throwing desktop users aside.
First and foremost, they have restored the coveted Start Menu. Nearly 20 years after its creation, it is finally making its return and, with it, Microsoft is finally doing what it should have done all along. Instead of plaguing desktop users with a giant fullscreen view of their tiles, a much more user-friendly start menu — complete with a resizable dynamic tile menu — greets new and returning Windows users.
For desktop users, full-screen “modern” apps can now be run in resizable windows, along with legacy Windows 7 applications. Microsoft has not forgotten about the desktop, and the company is now adding loads of features, including a smarter snap and an updated command prompt and desktop search.
However, Microsoft has equally considered touchscreen users. For devices without physical keyboards, users will still be greeted by a modern user interface (UI), optimized for touchscreen. More impressively, when they attach to a keyboard with the new “continuum” feature, the desktop — along with more mouse- and keyboard-friendly UI features — will take the screen.
With Windows 10, Microsoft will also add universal apps to the Windows Store, which will run on all Windows 10 devices, everything from mobile to computer to television-connected media devices.
While its implementation was overly radical, Windows 8 and similar progressive ideas will help Microsoft continue to generate in order to remain prominent in the market. However, while progressive ideas are imperative, Microsoft must make sure that it is not too radical in implementation. Windows 10 should be a major improvement to Windows 8, restoring functionality to traditional users, while continuing to bring touchscreen and mobile users into the future.
