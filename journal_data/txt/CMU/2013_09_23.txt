After a string of 1–0 victories, the men’s soccer team found the net more often this week starting with a 3–0 victory over Washington & Jefferson College earlier on Wednesday. The Tartans ended the week pummeling the visiting Bethany College Bisons 5–0 on a rainy Saturday afternoon.
On Saturday, the Tartans first got on the scoreboard in the 19th minute when first-year Tristan Lockwood tapped in a well-placed ball from senior defender Ben Bryant for his first goal of the season. The play started off with a free kick by Bryant, who lobbed a pass near the right crossbar where it rebounded off a defender, meeting Lockwood who was right there to put in the goal.
Lockwood was very active in the first half and had many quality breakaways on the sideline. One of them led to a goal by senior forward Max Tassano who had a brilliant low shot to the corner of the net in the 22nd minute.
The Tartans frenetic attack, consisting of several through balls and great ball control, led to another goal in a matter of five minutes. This time, senior Mike Ferraco’s cross-pass into the penalty box found a sliding Lockwood who scored his second goal to put the Tartans up 3–0.
Near the end of a fabulous first half for the Tartans, Tassano found the net again, this time with a header off senior Jerome Reano’s cross that sailed to the back post.
“It was definitely a confidence booster for me to get two,” Tassano said. “I have been struggling recently with scoring.”
As it turned out, it was also a confidence boost for the whole team, as the Tartans emptied their bench in the second half. Senior Kevin Pierce had an easy goal into an empty net off a pass from Reano in the 60th minute. The Tartans continued their attack and had quality shots on goal.
“We made sure to be positive from the bench and make sure that we were cheering them on,” said senior Chris Wysocki, who was selected as the Division III Men’s Disney Soccer/NSCAA Player of the Week last Tuesday.
As impressive as the offense was in scoring five goals, the defense held its ground and allowed the Bisons to get only five shots on goal. “Our defense has been stellar this year,” Tassano said. “It’s been huge for us because we know they are probably not going to score, and if we get one or two, we got the game.”
Overall, it was a perfect game for the Tartans both offensively and defensively as they improved their record to 7–1. The Tartans will compete next against Grove City this Saturday at 4:30 p.m. at home.

After suffering a season-ending injury last year, junior William Duncan is excited to be back on the court as part of the men’s tennis team.
“It was miserable not being able to play,” Duncan said.
During his first year, he started experiencing extreme pain in his shoulder, especially when serving. After a visit to the doctor, he discovered that he had a SLAP tear. Deciding to get the necessary surgery was difficult, but Duncan persevered through a year without tennis.
“I am still trying to get back to where I was,” Duncan said. Though he doesn’t claim to be back to 100 percent, the results suggest he is getting close.
After five matches, Duncan remains undefeated. Duncan was also named the University Athletic Association Men’s Tennis Athlete of the Week Sept. 1–7.
The team — which has a short fall season — will compete next in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) Regional Tournament in Fredericksburg, Va. this weekend. The winner of the tournament will play in the ITA National Small College Championships in Florida.
Although the team has fallen short of making the national tournament in the past, Duncan believes that this year the goal is within reach.
“We have high expectations. We expect to make the NCAA,” Duncan said. If they do, Duncan will be a big reason why.
“[His] desire and heart has always been unquestionable; [they] are something any family would love to have on their team,” said his doubles partner, junior Christian Heaney-Secord.
Duncan is a computational and applied mathematics major looking to double major in computational biology and hoping to go to graduate school for bioinformatics.
Having to manage one’s time while playing a varsity sport can be difficult, but Duncan is able to manage his time well. “I don’t feel like it gets in the way [of school] at all,” Duncan said. “It’s like anyone else — you have busy weeks and weeks that aren’t as busy.”
Having started playing tennis at the age of 6, Duncan has grown through tennis both as a player and as a person.
When asked what his favorite part about tennis was, Duncan excitedly mentioned the competition. “When you win, it’s like you’re better than the other player and you’re just proving that,” he said with a light in his eyes.
Winning, however, isn’t everything to Duncan; using his entire potential is much more important. After every match, Duncan wants to feel he played his best even if he loses.
While tennis is largely an individual sport, Duncan also embraces playing as part of a team.
“Everyone cares, everyone wants to win, [and] everyone is working really hard to get better. And it’s good to be in that kind of environment; you can push each other,” he said.
His teammates are also glad Duncan is returning to the courts.
“Willy Dunks is quite possibly the hardest working and most dedicated person I have ever met,” Heaney-Secord said.
As a team member, Duncan also plays an important leadership role.
One of his newest teammates, first-year Kenny Zheng, has found Duncan to be someone he can look up to. “[His] work ethic and determination make him a great role model for the rest of the team,” Zheng said.
After he finishes college, Duncan hopes to continue playing tennis competitively, though he recognizes that it may not be as accessible. Until then, Duncan will try to make the most of his time at Carnegie Mellon.

The women’s soccer team continued its streak of dominance last Friday, beating the La Roche College Redhawks at home 2–0 in convincing fashion.
The win — their fourth in a row — improves their record to 5–1–1.
The Tartans started scoring in the 10th minute when senior defender Rachel Contopoulos curved a corner kick into the top right corner of the net for her first goal of the season.
The Tartans cruised for the rest of the game, controlling possession in La Roche territory while pressuring the Redhawks into turnovers in the rare instances where they had the ball
The Redhawks’ only shot of the game came in the 18th minute and harmlessly soared over the net. The Tartans ended the game with 24 shots. 
Sophomore Louisa Pendergast scored her second goal of the season in the 57th minute.
“We switched our positioning — instead of having two center-mid[fielders], we had two attacking mid[fielders],” she said.
Sophomore Amanda Broderick advanced the ball to outside the penalty box and found Pendergast on her left, who struck the ball with her left foot past the goalie’s stretched arm.
“No one was defending me. It was an easy shot,” she said.
For the Redhawks, the game was one long, self-tormenting cycle. With the Tartans keeping possession in the La Roche half, the Redhawks took many goal kicks. Unfortunately for them, their goal kicks bounced back to Carnegie Mellon players, which allowed the Tartans to restart their attack in great position.
“They dropped off a lot of defensive players,” Pendergast said, which allowed them to win the opposing goal kicks. “And they were short.”
Over their four-game winning streak, the Tartans have outshot their opponents 60–14.
Despite their recent success, Pendergast says there is still room for improvement. “I think we have a lot to work on,” she said. “The progression has been going well, but we really need to start putting teams away.”
“Once we touch up our attacking third, I think we’ll have a solid season,” she said.
On Friday, the Tartans had an opportunity to increase their lead in the 30th minute. Junior Lucy Havens — taking a penalty kick after sophomore Carson Quiros was taken down in the box — shot right into the diving goalie’s hand.
In the first half, first-year forward Megan Bartoshuk caused havoc on the left flank, creating chances for her teammates by advancing the ball to the goal line and crossing the ball into the penalty box. 
In the eighth minute, she created a chance of her own as she beat her defender and drove a shot that clanged off the crossbar.
The Tartans will play Wednesday at home at 7 p.m. against Juniata College.

The Cleveland Browns have been the epitome of futility since they were refounded in 1999. The original Browns franchise moved to Baltimore in 1995, was renamed the Ravens, and has since won two Super Bowls, further proving that Cleveland is where sports teams go to die.
After another disappointing season and a transfer of ownership to businessman Jim Haslett, the Browns replaced their entire management, firing head coach Pat Shurmur and general manager Tom Heckert. Rod Chudzinski was hired to replace Shurmur and Michael Lombardi to replace Heckert.
The new management began the slow and arduous process of bringing the Browns out of the gutter and back to the level of their AFC North brethren: the Baltimore Ravens, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Cincinnati Bengals.
Normally, the standard ineptitude of the Browns isn’t headline news with the merry-go-round of head coaches, starting quarterbacks, and exceptional teams. This time is different, however, as the Browns have made one of the most shocking trades in NFL history: trading running back Trent Richardson, the third overall pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, to the Indianapolis Colts for a 2014 first-round pick.
The trade came as such a surprise that no one is quite sure who made the better deal, and more importantly, what in the world the new Browns management was thinking.
Richardson has been a polarizing player since his days at the University of Alabama. He first made an impact as the backup to the 2009 Heisman Trophy winner and current New Orleans Saint Mark Ingram. He then lead Alabama to a national championship in 2011 as the feature back, being named an All-American and winning the Doak Walker award for best college running back.
In the 2012 draft, the top two players were clearly quarterbacks Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin III. The Colts had the first pick and drafted Luck, while the Washington Redskins traded up from the sixth pick to snatch Griffin. The Browns were also interested in trading with the St. Louis Rams for the second overall pick but were outmatched by the Redskins offer of three first-round picks.
This left the Browns in an interesting spot, holding the fourth overall pick while the Minnesota Vikings sat in front of them with the third pick. The Browns decided to pass on quarterback Ryan Tannehill who fell to the Miami Dolphins at No. 8, and instead made the curious move to trade up one spot with the Vikings. The Browns then filled their quarterback need by taking Brandon Weeden, the oldest-ever player taken in the first round, with their 28th pick.
Which brings us to the present day. Normally, moves such as bailing on the third overall pick after only 18 games are reserved for coaches and general managers who know their days are numbered. But in this case, it appears that Cleveland’s front office is taking the exact opposite approach, looking to the long term.
To return to relevancy, the Browns need a franchise quarterback. The Weeden experiment has failed; its failure is further pronounced when the other quarterbacks of Weeden’s draft class — Luck, Griffin, Tannehill, and third-round pick Russell Wilson — have established themselves as franchise cornerstones.
This upcoming draft is likely to be full of NFL-caliber quarterbacks with Teddy Bridgewater and Heisman Trophy-winner Johnny Manziel leading the way. The trade appears to be setting the stage for the Browns to pick any incoming quarterback and make the necessary trade to get him with multiple first-round picks in their arsenal.
For the Colts, this is an interesting move. Rarely do teams get the chance to bring in a potential Pro Bowl talent for only a first-round pick. The Colts gave up a chance to draft a great player for one they believe is already proven. But history will tell whether or not Richardson becomes a Hall of Famer, or another in the long line of running back busts who can’t last more than a few years, given the wear and tear they receive on a weekly basis.
If Richardson can help protect Luck from blitzing linebackers making the Colts offensive line look like Swiss cheese, and if the Colts can rebound from a tough 1–1 start to make the playoffs, the move will be considered genius. In addition, if the Colts’ legitimate passing threat forces teams to stop crowding the line of scrimmage against Richardson — thus making his pedestrian yards-per-carry rise to the level of a great player — the Browns will have added another item to their long list of poor moves.
The two teams are clearly heading in opposite directions, with the Browns looking toward the future and the Colts making it clear that they aim to win now. Let’s see how both teams fare in a year or two after all of the pieces have fallen into place.

“The world we are delivering to the next generation is utterly unsustainable.”
These are the words of professor Terry Collins, senior member of the Institute for Green Science and honorary professor of green chemistry. In recent years, because of the exploitation of carbon-emitting fossil fuels, the growing industrialization in developing countries, and the damaging treatment of the environment, green chemistry has emerged as a necessity for ensuring that our planet remains viable.
Green chemistry is the study and research of new methods and processes that limit the use of hazardous substances emitted into the environment. This problem of an unsustainable future has been at the center of Collins’s career and at the center of the field of green chemistry.
Collins has been one of the primary leaders of green chemistry. “My career started in 1980, and green chemistry didn’t come along till 1991. But the 11 years before green chemistry, I was doing green chemistry,” he said. In fact, as a result of Collins’s heavy investment in green chemistry even before its onset, Carnegie Mellon was the first institution to offer classes on the field.
While there are myriad pathways in the field of green chemistry, Collins has his sights on designing a way to reduce water pollution. Currently, different molecules flow into the water supply from medications, waste, purifiers, and other hosts. Many of these molecules have detrimental effects on not only humans that drink the water, but also on the aquatic life that lives in the water. Collins’s lab focuses on endocrine disruptors, which are some the most harmful toxins currently being excreted into the water supply.
The endocrine system controls the development of bodily functions, whether it be growth, tissue functions, reproductive functions, or metabolism. Endocrine disruptors are the most devastating toxins in water because if any stage of development is distrubed, the organism could be permanently changed or mutated.
“The endocrine disruption problem is the reason that the chemical enterprise is currently unsustainable,” Collins warned. “If I can take some pressure off through the water, then that is wonderfully rewarding, personally,” he said.
With this goal in mind, Collins has spent the last 15-20 years perfecting a method of removing these harmful toxins from the water. His invention, and the hallmark of his career, is the tetra-amido macrocyclic ligand (TAML) catalyst. Collins and his lab engineered this catalyst to oxidize and destroy harmful toxins in the water. A unique property of this molecule is that very small amounts of it are able to target and destroy numerous kinds of harmful wastes.
“It’s essentially like putting fire with water; minuscule amounts of TAML oxidize toxins down and take them all out. That’s what you want; you want a generic blow torch that goes in and gets rid of all the toxins in the water,” Collins said.
According to Collins, the oxidation properties of the man-made catalyst are actually working better than natural catalysts. “They are out-performing the enzymes. We are able to put them in water with tiny amounts and they work,” he said.
Collins is working in conjunction with other institutions to start a company that will commercialize and utilize his catalyst to clean water in both Europe and the United States. However, one of the major concerns and points of further investigation, is whether or not the TAML catalysts themselves are harmful to humans. Over the last decade Collins has researched and documented the effects of his catalyst on organisms at unprecedented levels. The main goal of the research has been to prove that the TAML catalyst does not act as an endocrine disruptor.
“We are mapping the entire territory on how to design to not create an endocrine disruptor. We’ve done more than anyone has ever done. People just don’t do these studies,” he said. The lab has been working mainly with fish species to test the effects of TAML. While fish are a similar model to humans, the lab will do further research to confirm that there are no side effects on mammals.
Abigail Burton is a senior in the chemistry department’s joint BS/MS program and a part of Collins’s lab. “I find Professor Collins’s research interesting because it’s important and currently relevant to the real world. It is interesting academically because we do things that no one has ever done before, but it is also interesting because the problems our research solve are relevant to all life on our planet,” she said.
The research being done on TAML catalysts has enabled us to envision new ways of maintaining the ecosystems we occupy. With further successful testing, one day we might see the fruits of Collins’s career enriching the lives of millions around the world.

Have a textbook you want to sell? Furniture you want to get rid of? Tickets to a game or concert you can’t make anymore? One option is DormDeal, a new web app developed by a team of Carnegie Mellon alumni that allows members of the campus community to buy or sell used goods in a safe environment.
The app was developed by Jonathan Bender and Nolan Carroll, both information systems students who graduated this past year; Collin Buchan, a fifth-year electrical and computer engineering master’s student; and Patrick Hogan, a recent mechanical engineering graduate. Bender currently holds the position of CEO, Carroll is the web developer, Buchan is the Android developer, and Hogan is in charge of design.
The group members began as best friends who decided to enter the 2013 TartanHacks competition during their senior year. “Nolan actually had the domain [dormdeal.com] since freshman year ... so we thought it would be a great idea to actually make it at the competition,” Bender said.
The team ended up winning the “eBay Best of eCommerce Hack” award, which inspired the group to take the project further. “I don’t think any of us expected for it to take off as much as it did from TartanHacks,” Hogan said.
Despite having only been developed this past January, DormDeal already has over 1,200 users. Currently, the main universities that are parts of the system are Carnegie Mellon, the University of Pittsburgh, and Pennsylvania State University. The app aims to connect buyers and sellers in the same location.
“We operate under the assumption that people have physical access to their university and can make deals on their campus,” Buchan said. 
Bender added, “The way we view it is that if we’re right down the street from Pitt, why not walk 200 yards and get a textbook for $20 cheaper?”
A user must have a university-associated email address in order to create an account.  “This really helps ensure that layer of trust that the people you’re dealing with are members of your community, and since they’re not anonymous, they will be held accountable for their actions,” Buchan explained. He also mentioned that in other used-goods markets, such as Craigslist, users will create more than one account to barter with sellers unfairly. On DormDeal, however, you can only sign up once.
Another feature of the app is that it is very image oriented. “People like to know what they’re getting. Personally, I would never buy something on Craigslist unless I can see a picture of it,” Carroll said. Though it is not required for sellers to use pictures, there is a filter option to search only for products that come with pictures. Search results can also be narrowed to specific product categories, such as books, furniture, electronics, appliances, apparel, and tickets.
Ticket sales have been very popular — particularly at colleges such as Penn State, which boasts a prominent sports culture. “One of the things we’re looking at, especially for ticket sales ... is being able to have it show the bids of other people so you can have a bidding war,” Bender said. 
While ticket sales may be popular at certain universities, DormDeal may discover other niches at different schools as it expands. “It’s tailored to each different college, to see what their community is like, and the things they’re looking to buy and sell,” Hogan said.
Some future directions that the team is taking include deals for housing, promotions in Pittsburgh, a ride-share program, and developing an iOS app. DormDeal’s new housing section will allow students to contact members living in off-campus housing who are graduating or looking for new roommates, as well as allow people to be pulled into open slots in on-campus housing. 
“We’re looking to have that done in the next couple of months,” Bender said, “so that it will be ready before room draw happens.” 
The section on promotions in Pittsburgh will allow restaurants and other local companies to offer student deals through DormDeal. Ride share will endeavor to connect students who want to carpool home for breaks or for other reasons.
“We really want this to be a service to students,” Bender said. “We want to make it something that is eventually the first thing you think of when you think of selling your textbook because it’s easy and free to you.”

Due to compatibility differences between smartphone platforms, apps for mobile devices can often only be developed for a single operating system. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon are working on ways to expedite the process of converting apps between operating systems through their startup and computer platform: Apportable.
Collin Jackson, an assistant research professor at Carnegie Mellon CyLab and the Information Networking Institute (INI) on the Silicon Valley campus (CMU-SV), developed the idea with co-founder Ian Fischer and Chinmay Garde, a graduate student at CMU-SV. The startup, now located in downtown San Francisco, has grown in popularity and translates apps from iOS to Android platforms. “We solved a problem and helped developers so that they don’t have to individually deal with the hassle of always translating the coding for one device into another language,” Jackson said.
Jackson came up with the idea for the startup while looking up apps on an iPhone and realizing that they were not available for Android, the most commonly used mobile platform worldwide. He noticed that it could take developers a long time to release the Android version of some iOS apps due to technical barriers that hinder cross platform development. These technical barriers are a slow and expensive process to overcome because they require the developer to rewrite the app in a new language and maintain a second code base for the Android version. Apportable helps make the process of translating between platforms faster, cheaper, and easier, while maintaining the quality and functionality of the original app.
In the early days of Apportable, Jackson and his team members developed a version of Objective-C, the language used to build iOS apps, that runs on Android phones. The team then developed prototype applications in iOS and ported them to Android using this technique. The prototypes were presented to Google Ventures, the venture capital investment arm of Google Inc., in order to fundraise for the project. The funding was then used to recruit technical teams to develop Apportable, a commercial product that grew to have 10s  of millions of users.
Currently, many game developers use Apportable and subsequently help promote Objective-C as the language for building apps across all platforms. Future directions for the company involve implementing the user interface framework used by certain photo sharing and music apps, like Bjork’s Biophilia album for Android, which is the first music app to be released for Android that was first written in Objective-C. The team is also helping non-game developers launch apps for Android through Apportable by building Android development tanks into their platform, allowing it to receive automatic support from a wide range of devices.
Making Apportable compatible with various devices was challenging. “Major challenges involved paying attention to a large number of little details to get Apportable to run perfectly,” Jackson said. In one particular example, “Apple developed an app that provided a ton of functionality, but the team had to provide equivalent functionality for Android hardware that was not designed to run iOS code, which required a lot of time,” he added.
Although much of their work focuses on converting apps for Android, Apportable is aimed at letting customers translate apps between different programming languages. The team’s favorite part of the startup? According to Jackson, it’s simply helping people overcome a time-consuming hindrance.

Whether studying for an upcoming exam, following a daily routine, or merely recognizing day-to-day objects, everyone is dependent on their memory to complete even the simplest tasks. Despite the fact that memory is such an integral part of our lives, scientists are only just beginning to understand the complex science behind our ability to remember.
The concept of memory can be generally broken up into three main categories: encoding, storage, and retrieval. Encoding deals with converting perceptions into chemical signals; this begins with our senses. According to howstuffworks.com, as our senses take in a variety of stimuli, the hippocampus and the frontal cortex — two parts of the brain — decide if the information is important enough to be remembered. If the information is deemed worthy, it is converted into chemical signals that travel through nerve cells in our brains.
The main action of encoding, however, occurs at synapses, which are the spaces in between nerve cells. When chemical signals reach a synapse, they fire across the gap to the next nerve cell, which releases neurotransmitters that create a link between the two cells.
As information is processed in this manner, a network of links between nerve cells is created throughout the brain. This process records all sensory perceptions including (but not limited to) visual, tactile, and emotional stimuli. The network constantly changes as more stimuli are encoded and is strengthened through repetition.
The second major aspect of memory, storage, is divided into sensory storage, short-term storage, and long-term storage. Sensory storage is used only for the initial perception of stimuli. Once the brain has decided that the information is worthy of being remembered, it is sent to either short-term or long-term storage. According to USA Today, short-term memory storage can hold approximately seven items for about 30 seconds. Anything past that is sent into long-term storage, where practically unlimited amounts of information can be stored indefinitely.
New stimuli are often linked with previous signals that are kept in long-term storage, which explains why it is often easier for people to remember things that are related to prior knowledge. A simple example of this is the use of mnemonic devices. By relating new information to something that the brain is already familiar with — such as the alphabet — the brain is forced to use neuron paths that have already been solidified by repetition. It then becomes much easier to remember new information.
The final category is memory retrieval. In order to remember something, the encoded information is unconsciously retrieved from the network of neurons present in the brain.
Difficulty in remembering something can be caused by a defect in any one of the three areas of memory. The stimuli might have never been properly encoded. The brain could have failed to store the information due to distractions or a glitch in short-term or long-term memory — or there could be a problem with the retrieval of the information. This last problem generally occurs when there is a discrepancy between the prompt the brain is using to remember the signal and the original signal that was encoded, according to howstuffworks.com. 
Through encoding, storage, and retrieval, humans are able to recognize everything from the time of day to complex mathematics. This allows people to perceive, understand, and respond to the variety of stimuli we encounter every day.

3-D printed objects may help blind use Internet
Blind children in Japan can now feel the results of their latest web search. Hands On Search, sponsored by Yahoo! Japan, is a project aimed at making Internet search results tactile, rather than just visual and auditory.
The Special Needs Education School for the Visually Impaired, affiliated with the University of Tsukuba, Tokyo, has a custom-made 3-D printer which looks like a big puffy cloud. When kids ask the machine for things, it processes the request using voice recognition, searches for the relevant 3-D data and prints out the object.

Breakthrough in Alzheimer’s diagnosis
Researchers have developed a way to illuminate a key protein associated with Alzheimer’s. Until very recently, all research on Alzheimer’s was based on detecting amyloid, a sticky substance that develops in the brain of people suffering from Alzheimer’s. However, another protein called tau, also associated with Alzheimer’s, piles up in the brain in the form of harmful tangles.
Researchers at  National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Japan, have discovered that a class of molecules can latch onto tau tangles and help illuminate them during PET scans.

Vitamin E fights static electricity
It has been found that Vitamin E can get rid of static electricity. Static electricity, known for the tiny jolts that one gets while walking barefoot on a carpet, can cause shocks that spark fires and explosions in electronics. 
When surfaces rub against each other, uncharged molecules called free radicals are generated in addition to the static electric charges. Researchers at Northwestern University have shown that these radicals help stabilize the charges that develop. Vitamin E is a radical scavenger, which absorbs these radicals. Thus, when the objects are dipped in a Vitamin E solution, the charges are destabilized and static electricity cannot be generated.

Comets may be source of life
New findings support the hypothesis that life on Earth arose from the wreckage of comet collisions. Experiments have found that when a steel projectile is collided with a comet-like concoction, amino acids are produced. Amino acids are the building blocks for proteins, which are the key molecules for life. It is possible energy from the impact of the comets with the earth may have catalyzed the transformation of simple carbon compounds into amino acids.
This is an alternative to the traditional hypothesis that life arose on earth from combination of chemicals that existed in the earth’s atmosphere and deep-sea vents.

Yeast strain can endlessly rejuvenate
Scientists at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics have found that a certain type of yeast can stay young forever by rejuvenating every time it reproduces.
In general, microbes reproduce by splitting into two halves and dividing the cell material between the two halves. In most cases, one of the halves gets all the new material and the other gets all the old and damaged material. 
In one yeast type, however, when the cell splits, an equal amount of old and new material goes into both the resultant halves. As both cells get only half the damaged material, the resultant cells are both appear younger than before.

iPhone 5S raises privacy and security concerns
One of the highlights of Apple’s newly released iPhone 5S is a fingerprint scanner to unlock the phone. This does away with the need for a passcode, making the phone much more secure against theft and misuse.
However, concerns have been raised about the collection of sensitive personal data like fingerprints. In addition to a possible privacy concern, it’s a potential security hazard as well; If one’s fingerprints fall into the wrong hands, hackers can impersonate him or her for the rest of their life, as they are inalterable.

The Miller Gallery’s newest installation, Alien She, explores the creative influence of the Riot Grrrls, an underground feminist punk movement rooted in Los Angeles that started making noise in the ’90s. Curated by former Riot Grrrls Astria Suparak and Ceci Moss, the exhibit “[reflects] on this movement’s influence on a generation of people,” according to Moss. 
Alien She opened on Friday and will run through Feb. 16 before touring the country.

Season 17 of Dancing with the Stars kicked off on Monday night promising a new format, new production — and of course, new stars. But this time, the show’s classic formula showed through: It’s the same dancing show time after time because stars’ success relies on dancing ability and likability in equal parts. As the seasons progress, there are a few cookie-cut roles that remain constant.
There is the athlete. This season, it’s Keyshawn Johnson, who moves in the stiff athletic way of a 6’4” former pro football player. His performance was marked by poor dancing and low scores.
There is the love interest — the partners that make us question if they’re more than just dance partners. This season it’s Pretty Little Liars actor Brant Daugherty and his partner, Peta Murgatroyd. The two quickly established that they were single and attractive, and there was a notable level of passion in their performance.
There are the forgotten stars — namely singer Christina Milian and actresses Elizabeth Berkley and Leah Remini. Milian came out strong with great choreography. Berkley seemed sweet and was a fair dancer, and Remini brought a lot of personality to the stage.
Actor Corbin Bleu danced dynamically. He is one of the few male dancers in the show’s history to really draw attention rather than let the professional do all the work. He displays a will to push himself, which resulted in a performance earning one of the top scores of the night.
There are the heartwarming stories. Former reality TV star Jack Osbourne focused his introduction on his experience with multiple sclerosis. He came across as a genuine, soft-spoken guy and impressed everyone with his dancing. Another inspiring story came from actress Valerie Harper: She was given just months to live due to lung and brain cancer, but she is now beating the odds and thriving on the show. She stole the hearts of many viewers not just with her story but with her sweet mannerisms and grace. She floated across the floor in an elegant, simple routine.
There are the stars that draw in a large number of viewers: Snooki, the self-proclaimed “hot mess,” took the stage looking strikingly thin. She promises that her partying days are over and she is ready to be more mature, but this claim fell flat as she shrieked “ew” and “perv” at her dance partner. Personality aside, she was a great dancer, receiving praise from the judges. 
Bill Nye is the kind of contestant that makes this show so special. Nye offered an admittedly poor performance, receiving the lowest scores of the night. But the crowd chanted his name as he finished and booed animatedly when the judges criticized him.
Bill Nye was a true class act. He brought a rose for his partner in a flask, taking time to teach us the difference between a flask and beaker. He spoke in lovely expressions, exclaiming, “Even a blind squirrel finds a nut sometimes,” discussed evolution, and danced in an endearing way. As judge Carrie Ann Inaba put it, he is “the heart of the show.” While he cannot keep up in dancing ability, his personality might just be enough to buy him a few more weeks.
Credit must be given where due, and Glee star Amber Riley stole the stage Monday night. Judge Bruno Tonioli described her as the “tigress of season 17.” She performed with ferocity and precision and received praise and high scores. While she is not the most widely-known star, she quickly grabbed viewers’ attention with her charisma. She spoke about wanting to be a role model for girls her size, wanting them to see her “throwing this weight around.” She was the most captivating and inspiring performer of the night and will surely go far in the competition.
While Dancing with the Stars is deeply rooted in the traditional format, it has yet to feel tired. The fresh crop of stars brings new life to the show and a promise for a season of fantastic dancing and dynamic personalities.

TV premiere season has begun, and on Tuesday night comes one of the season’s most anticipated pilots: ABC’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.
To be clear, this isn’t The Avengers. This is the team that finds the superheroes, sorting through the weird to find the spectacular.
The ensemble features Melinda May, a seasoned field agent portrayed by Mulan voice actor Ming-Na Wen; newly recruited Grant Ward (Brett Dalton); hacker-turned-team-member Skye (Chloe Bennet); and Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons (Ian De Caestecker and Elizabeth Henstridge), a tag team of a tech genius and a biochemist. Together the team is the face of a new initiative formed by Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) following the events in The Avengers. Their job is to find and keep tabs on emerging superheroes and otherworldly events, so that S.H.I.E.L.D. — the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division — can have a better handle on superhuman events and threats.
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is a continuation of The Avengers’ universe; currently, there are no plans to feature any of Marvel’s big-name superheroes, such as Iron Man or Thor, in any storylines. Executive producer Joss Whedon revealed at the Television Critics Association (TCA) Press Tour panel that the show is not intended to be “an Easter egg farm” for the Marvel universe. The show will be able to stand on its own, instead of constantly referring back to the past Marvel films.
Whedon is no stranger to TV shows, having produced such classics as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the short-lived Firefly. Most recently, Whedon wrote and directed The Avengers and adapted William Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing to the silver screen. Unfortunately for the show, he is also working on the sequel to The Avengers, which could reduce the amount of time he spends on Agents.
The show’s format will be serial in style, like its time slot competitor, CBS crime drama NCIS, but will feature a continuous storyline to bring the season together. TvLine.com reported that Avengers veteran Cobie Smulders, reprising her role as Agent Maria Hill in the pilot, will be the one to plant the seeds for the overarching mystery. Although currently her appearance has only been confirmed for the first episode — a surprise kept secret until the closed screening of the pilot at this summer’s San Diego Comic-Con — perhaps viewers will get to see more from Agent Hill after Smulders finishes as Robin Scherbatsky in the final season of How I Met Your Mother.
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s Agent Coulson was last seen in his death scene in The Avengers, but he’s back to head this new team as they head out on cases. For those confused about his resurrection, don’t worry — that story will come out. Whedon revealed at the panel that it will be “something of a drawn-out explanation.”
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. premieres tomorrow at 8 p.m. EST.

Kanye West, Lady Gaga, and Wes Anderson rarely make it into academia as subjects of study, and they’re even less frequently cited in this sense as renowned theorists like Judith Butler, Michel Foucault, and Emma Goldman. But a combination of pop culture and high-brow intellectualism was precisely what queer theorist Jack Halberstam brought to Carnegie Mellon in his Thursday lecture. The lecture — sponsored by the Center for Arts in Society, the English department, and Trans-Q TV — was titled “No Church in the Wild: Queer Anarchy & the Aesthetics of Chaos” and focused on a discussion of queerness and anarchy through the lens of popular culture.
Halberstam is currently a professor of English and the director of the Center for Feminist Research at the University of Southern California. He is a gender and queer theorist, and his books cover topics like female masculinity, critiques of heteronormativity and capitalism, and popular culture. His most recent book, 2012’s Gaga Feminism: Sex, Gender, and the End of Normal, looks at the significance of Lady Gaga’s fame — what she symbolizes and why it matters — and results in a manifesto of sorts, calling for a new type of feminism that encourages creative chaos and fluidity.
Halberstam’s talk on Thursday was focused on ideas of “the Wild” and queer anarchy: what they are, where we see them, and what they could mean for the future. Halberstam defined anarchy as a new form of opposition to the state and to institutionality in general and drew on political movements like Occupy to demonstrate that “people are turning now to political projects of anarchy.” The talk was extremely accessible even to those without a background in queer or political theory. Halberstam relied on popular culture reference points to guide his talk.
According to Halberstam, the current movement toward anarchy is all about disrupting the system and calling into question all of the social norms that we take for granted. The majority of the talk focused on where we see these ideas in popular culture, including Wes Anderson’s 2009 film The Fantastic Mr. Fox and Jay-Z and Kanye West’s Watch the Throne. “Art is a special place for experiments with anarchy,” Halberstam said, noting that in art, there’s less concern for practical consequences.
Fantastic Mr. Fox is a story about a fox that steals chickens from wealthy farmers every night until the farmers catch on and try to kill him. The fox and his family retaliate, outwitting the farmers and creating new homes underground. According to Halberstam, this film can be interpreted as a radical tale of queer anarchist disruption. The foxes literally go underground to escape the farmers, but this could be viewed as them creating a subculture that rejects capitalism and traditional ideas of male heroism.
Halberstam also discussed Jay-Z and Kanye West’s hit song “No Church in the Wild,” from their hit album Watch the Throne. The song embodies many major themes of the album as a whole: fame, wealth, power, and the challenges of these successes. R&B singer Frank Ocean — who happens to be gay, a point Halberstam finds worth noting — sings the refrain on the song: “Human beings in a mob./What’s a mob to a king?/What’s a king to a god?/What’s a god to a non-believer?/Who don’t believe in anything?”
“I hear anarchy in that lyric,” Halberstam said, discussing the difficulty of “non-believing” in a world where theology and existing power structures rule. Halberstam believes in the power of people to change society through solidarity with others who want the same things. By subverting the power of markets and the average person’s status as a mindless consumer, Halberstam believes we can be heroes like the protagonists of The Fantastic Mr. Fox and create actual, productive change.
Halberstam closed his talk with a discussion of drag culture and a few queer artists who continue to push the limits of art and disruption, before opening the floor to questions.
“I’m not convinced that anarchy is even supposed to be laid out in terms of a political regime,” Halberstam said, in response to an audience question about how anarchy can be understood through the most recent Batman movie. He emphasized his point that the anarchy he sees is more a means of disruption to our typical ways of thinking. “We’re not really debating new forms of subculture, but we are turning to anarchy to ask questions,” he said.
Attendees were left with a lot to think about, from how we interpret popular culture to what questions we ask about political structures. Halberstam acknowledged that he, too, still has questions, and that that’s okay: “I’m happy to sit with some of this material and not know.”

Once the canned laughter filling in all the funny (and not-so-funny) jokes disappeared from the background noise of The Idiot Box, something clicked. The play, originally by playwright and screenwriter Michael Elynow, produced a revelation among audience members. Amid the pregnant pause of expectance, both the characters and the audience realized that the “reality” in which they had existed was simply a carefully crafted, false universe and that it was time to face the terrifying real world. That poignant moment of silence perfectly encapsulated the message behind The Idiot Box.
The production, which ran Monday through Saturday in the Helen Wayne Rauh Studio Theatre of the Purnell Center, was co-directed by junior directing major Alex Tobey and Pittsburgh guest director Tami Dixon as a part of the Junior Performance Projects series. According to the show note, written by sophomore dramaturgy major Holly Dennis, The Idiot Box is meant to examine reality in a modern context — and what better way to do that than through America’s obsession with TV?
The show is centered on the cast of a sitcom called Pals, a close imitation of the iconic show Friends. During the play, the characters go from living a perfectly ordinary existence to one fraught with drama. All of the sudden, the corny jokes go away, and instead of dealing with an untrained puppy, they find themselves grappling with issues such as messy breakups, divorce, coming out, and depression. Their lives become complicated and unplanned, and they must learn to cope with it.
The small cast of this play was composed of junior acting majors: Chloe (Colleen Pulawksi), a romance writer with writer’s block; Connor (Jeremy Hois), her doting husband; Billy (Luke LaMontagne), a sex-crazed, funny man; Fiona (Olivia Brown), a bubbly blonde; and Mark (Benjamin Edelman), the straight-edged owner of the apartment.
The cast blended perfectly, staying in character through both the lighthearted sitcom moments and the dramatic, heart-pounding ones. Their perfect chemistry made viewers feel as though they were watching a scripted, orchestrated television show, until the world fell apart and the characters became real.
The show was smart and witty, not to mention painfully poignant. In a moment toward the end, when the characters are realizing with horror what dealing with the real world has done to them, Mark sits down 
with Chloe, who is resisting the return to normalcy. In order to convince her to forget Omar (Mitchell Edwards) — the dashing stranger with whom she has fallen in love and has made plans to escape — Mark describes his harrowing experience as a medic during 9/11. Seeing how Elyanow wrote the play in response to the media’s unresponsive attitude toward the crisis, it seemed appropriate for the show to close on such a somber note.
In essence, the cast and context of the show — eight friends, eight rooms, one big penthouse in the Big Apple — represented the carefully protected and forced innocence of Americans. When that naivety and blindness is shattered, the characters are tossed into crisis mode and are forced to come to terms with reality by discovering that their canned world is an illusion.
Through Dixon’s careful planning and design choices — from having the cast pose as if in an opening scene to introducing a theme song for Pals that closely resembles that of Friends — the message of the play is clearly conveyed, despite the risk of it getting lost in the many details of the plot. The entire cast and crew of the play should be applauded for creating a believable and meaningful play within a play scenario that resonated even after the lights went down.

Angel Olsen is the kind of singer-songwriter that belongs to an older time — a time before computers, when all music was made using purely natural sounds. Raw talent and emotion shimmers throughout her work, both in terms of her beautiful singing as well as her lyrics. Olsen will be performing tomorrow at the Andy Warhol Museum on the North Shore.
Chicago native Olsen first made her name known in 2011 with the release of Strange Cacti. Since then, she has been garnering acclaim everywhere she goes. Half Way Home, released last September, was met with critical praise from the likes of Pitchfork.com and Allmusic.com. Half Way Home is built upon the sound of its predecessor, adding more country-like arrangements and at times a fuller instrumental sound.
Olsen’s music is heavily folk and country inspired, which makes every song sound a little familiar even if you’ve never heard it before. She generally uses just her voice with soft acoustic or electric guitar accompaniment, which is no problem because her voice is truly the crux of her talent. Within a single song she can go from a soft whisper to a full, yodeling sound that gives many tracks a large range.
Her recent single “Sweet Dreams” features a full band, forcing Olsen to prove just exactly who the star of the show is. Her lyrics, while not of the same caliber as her musical skills, offer insights into topics such as death, falling in and out of love, and loneliness. “Acrobat” touches on the longing to be connected to another in every single way including the finality of death.
“Miranda” shows her taking on the role of a police officer reading a lying lover his or her rights before questioning. While not every song touches on such bleak subject matter, the overall mood of her music is despondent. Despite the sad words, however, on the whole the songs come off as more comforting than depressing, following the construct of her country and folk influences.
If previous performances accurately predict, Olsen’s upcoming show at the Andy Warhol Museum should be an intimate and engaging affair. Olsen’s is definitely a name to watch; she is one of those singer-songwriters who can truly bring it all to the table, and these days that’s an increasingly rare commodity. Next time you’re alone but don’t feel like going out, I recommend looking to her for company.
Doors to Olsen's performance at the Warhol will be open at 7:30 p.m. for a 9:00 show. Tickets are $12 with a valid student ID at the door and $15 without one.

Hey Batman,
Would you be willing to write a last-minute Advice for Awkward People? New Patrick(s??) isn’t getting back to us.
Sincerely,
Expecting Vulgarities And Nothing
Hey EVAN,
Yes.
What have you gotten yourself into,
Batman
Dear Batman,
How did you get the email batman@cmu.edu? Who do I have to bribe or give sexual favors / DineX / Vocelli’s to in order to get a rad email like you?
Sincerely,
Fake Reader, Especially Since Having Meaningful Advice Now
Dear FRESHMAN,
You don’t have to bribe or give sexual favors/DineX/Vocelli’s to anyone to get a “rad” email, but I will take all of the Vocelli’s you can feed me, preferably quad pineapple thin crust. It’s coupon code 700, but who cares about saving money when you’re using DineX?
Just go to http://www.cmu.edu/computing/email/cmuname/index.html. It’s easier than C@CM. Unless you failed C@CM. Then this would be awkward.
Twerker@cmu.edu will look great on your résumé,
Batman
Dear Batman,
Why Batman?
Sincerely,
Do Even Enlightened People Quite Understand Even Sometimes Truth Is Only Non Sequitur
Dear DEEP QUESTIONS,
Because I’m the hero Carnegie Mellon deserves, but not the one it needs right now.
Or, because when I chose my name in Chinese, it got me thinking — why can’t I just change my name in English?
Sometimes it’s only madness that makes us what we are,
Batman

Man of Steel
Thursday, Sept. 26

(Note: FREE as part of Ceilidh Weekend!)
Superman is back but with a whole new look. Zach Snyder and Christopher Nolan join forces to reboot America’s favorite superhero with more action and spectacle. The movie does not disappoint: Its brutal action sequences add a sense of exhilaration in scenes with Superman, played by the genetically blessed Henry Cavill, who struggles as a quiet alien hero amongst men. 
Margin Call
Friday, Sept. 27
7:30 10
One of the smartest Wall Street movies in recent years, Margin Call provides a thrilling look into the world of Wall Street within a period of 24 hours. The movie is a fictional account of an investment firm in Manhattan scrambling through a transformational night of the 2008 financial crisis. Director J.C. Chandor crafted a methodical thriller that proves engaging and intelligent. Featuring a solid ensemble cast and a marvelously sharp and clever screenplay, the film leaves the audience with just as many questions as it does answers as to whether financial firms are doing more harm than good.

In the latest Pixar installment, Mike and Sully are back in school, training to become the scariest monsters on campus. A genuinely heartwarming prequel to Monsters, Inc., the film is a great story about friendship and growing up that doesn’t bank on nostalgia. Also, for all of us with Tartan pride, one of the Monsters University campus buildings looks just like Hamerschlag Hall. Perhaps Pixar looked at Carnegie Mellon for inspiration? Watch Monsters University to find out!

Michael J. Tarr will take up the role of head of the department of psychology in January 2014, according to a university press release. Tarr, currently the George A. and Helen Dunham Cowan Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience, will succeed Michael Scheier, who has occupied the position for more than a decade.
Tarr, who grew up in Pittsburgh, joined the faculty in 2009 after holding several positions at other universities. He received his Ph.D. from MIT in 1989, subsequently spending six years at Yale University and 14 years at Brown University before arriving at Carnegie Mellon. When asked why he chose to come to Carnegie Mellon, Tarr pointed to the “awesome interdisciplinary training” offered by the psychology department.
His research focuses on how the brain takes 2-D images from the retina to create 3-D perceptions of events and items. His faculty biography notes some of his areas of expertise, including face and object recognition, visual categorization, and computation vision.
According to the press release, Tarr has been co-directing the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC) since 2009. The CNBC is a “joint center between CMU and the University of Pittsburgh devoted to investigating neural mechanisms and their impact on human cognitive abilities,” according to the press release. His tenure at the center has been very successful — the press release notes the CNBC has been responsible for the hiring of five faculty members and has raised upwards of $5 million in funding.
Tarr also co-founded a startup company, Neon, in 2012. According to the company’s website, Neon creates accurate video thumbnails by using models of “how the brain perceives images and can predict which ones people will prefer.”
“Michael Tarr is an outstanding scientist who has spent the past four years advancing Carnegie Mellon’s impact on the brain and behavioral sciences,” John Lehoczky, dean of the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, said in the press release.
Carnegie Mellon’s psychology department boasts 30 core faculty members, several research centers, and a childhood education center with a preschool and kindergarten.
Tarr feels very fortunate to be leading an already successful department, rather than a department in need of reform. 
Tarr noted in an interview that the psychology department at Carnegie Mellon is “one of the top-rated departments in the world,” and he hopes to “maintain that quality” and create new partnerships within Carnegie Mellon and its colleges, and particularly with the School of Computer Science.
While maintaining the quality, research-intensive program that the program boasts, Tarr hopes to move the department into new areas when appropriate. “It’s a wonderful department. I’m really pleased, and [I am] in a lucky position,” he said.

This past Friday, members of the Pittsburgh community gathered for PARK(ing) Day, a one-day worldwide event where volunteers, including Carnegie Mellon students, convert metered parking spots into temporary public parks.
The PARK(ing) Day project’s mission is “to call attention to the need for more urban open space, to generate critical debate around how public space is created and allocated, and to improve the quality of urban human habitat,” according to the PARK(ing) Day website.
The project was started by an art and design studio in San Francisco in 2005 and has since spread across the globe. The 2011 PARK(ing) Day inspired 975 parks in 162 cities, 35 countries, and six continents.
Participants of the project have gone beyond the original pop-up park design to create one-day events within a metered parking spot. 
These call attention to other social issues in their specific communities with projects like free health clinics, mini farms, political discussions, ecology demonstrations, and art installations.
Pittsburgh has participated in PARK(ing) Day since 2008, with up to 30 parks sprouting around the city each year. Master’s student in design Emily Abell and senior industrial design major Sharon Winter, along with four other graduate students in design, set up a parking spot on Forbes Avenue near Atwood Street last Friday from 8 a.m. – 3 p.m. They fed the meter and used an artificial grass carpet, potted trees, branches, stumps, and a makeshift bench to create their park.
“We wanted to focus on recycling and sustainability; everything we used we found in our own backyards or in Schenley Park, except for the fake grass,” Abell said.
The group also included interactive components in their park, inviting passers-by to write their thoughts about public parks on Post-it notes and to plant seeds in disposable cups from nearby food vendors. 
The notes were displayed in the park on wires strung between the potted trees; they included expressions of love for biking, hiking, picnicking, and clean air, as well as sketches of parks and trees.
The park garnered attention throughout the day from pedestrians who frequently stopped to ask questions, write down their ideas, and even eat lunch with the students. “We got a group of office workers from across the street. They said they had been watching us all day and just had to come down and see what we were doing,” Winter said.
Other memorable onlookers included an enthusiastic blogger who took a video of the park, three deaf students who communicated through Post-it notes, and a group of 20 bikers touring all 20 PARK(ing) spots in the city. “People asked if we were taking donations or what the purpose of this was, but it’s all just to get people to think about the way we use urban space,” Abell said.
The project triggered conversations about the desire for more public space, the need for improved public transport to decrease traffic and pollution, and rising prices in parking meters. The project also brought to light other urban issues and alternatives that many guests to the make shift parks admitted to never having considered before. “People asked us if we got any negative remarks, but we didn’t really; everyone was really positive and excited about the idea,” Abell said.
Abell and Winter graduate from Carnegie Mellon in the spring, but they hope that other Carnegie Mellon students will participate in next year’s PARK(ing) Day and that the project will continue to grow in support and interest, both within Carnegie Mellon and the larger Pittsburgh community, and inspiring more people to change the way they use urban space.

Bold: Get Noticed, Get Hired, a book written by a Tepper School of Business graduate and two University of Pittsburgh graduates, focuses on trying to make a meaningful connection with influential people in order to land a job.
The book was co-written by Liz Madsen (TSB ’11), Joshua Siva, and Melanie Feldman, Pitt graduates who took an entrepreneurship course at Carnegie Mellon. It was officially released Aug. 27, and is available in physical or digital versions on Amazon. Bold’s website describes the book as “based on creative strategies from real people who went from the middle of the résumé pile to the top,” promising, “We break down exactly what they did and how they did it so that you can build your own strategy off their success.”
“Especially to the attention span of a recent college grad, this book will be very useful. It gets to the point,” Feldman said.
The book covers examples and stories involving personalities such as ESPN sportscaster Neil Everett, as well as those of Alec Brownstein, who created a social media experiment where top advertising executives saw ads directed at them specifically when they performed a Google search of their own names.
“Our goal was to have a product we can get behind and would read ourselves,” Feldman said.
“We’ve put everything behind this,” Siva said, adding that reader feedback has “new ideas coming up in parallel.”
Madsen added, “the whole idea of the book is to help people land jobs,” and described the possibility of second and third editions containing stories and examples from readers.
Siva explained that their group “had tried all different sorts of tech ventures, but none of us are coders. It just so happened that Mel had gotten a job in a very different way.”
Co-authors Siva and Feldman met in the Tepper class Topics in Entrepreneurship taught by professor R. F. Culbertson. Both Siva and Feldmen were Pitt students at the time, and took the class through the Tepper School of Business. Culbertson described via email that their “book offers example after example of individuals who just ‘went after it’ - got ‘upset’ with the current process (emotion is often what it takes) - and found their own solution […] I think finding the people and getting their stories is great.”
Culbertson went on to describe that “Entrepreneurship is so often a ‘mindset’ more than an exact science,” and the mutual love of sales was “the common element about Mel and Josh.”
“We’ve had a sounding board in R.F. Culbertson,” Siva said. “His major mantra is to focus on the pain that people have and treat it. There’s a lot of pain for recent graduates.”
Junior business administration major Laviniu Filimon feels that the book’s connections to Carnegie Mellon could have a good effect on current students who will enter the workforce soon. “Having a Tepper grad participate in this guide book will encourage CMU students to be more active in their job searches,” Filimon said.
“The book has received really positive reactions. We’re off to a better start than we thought,” Feldman said. “People we didn’t expect had read the whole book and were organically spreading it.”
“We’re young. We just did this,” Madsen said. “We went through that pain, so we’re writing this in real time.”

Micah Rosa (TSB ’11) in his two years out of school with the launch of his media consulting business, Shoutside Media. The company  was featured in the Pittsburgh Business Times earlier this month.
Rosa’s knack for entrepreneurial endeavors started well before he graduated, when he created Shoutside Media’s predecessor SurhRosa in the course Introduction to Entrepreneurship. 
According to the Pittsburgh Business Times, SurhRosa was “a Web design agency that grew from a class project to a business serving restaurants around the city.”
Now a CEO in the world of media advertising, Rosa offered advice to current and recently graduated Carnegie Mellon students.
Above all else, Rosa advocated for the importance of computer skills in an increasingly online world. 
“No matter what department you are in, find a computer science student and be friends with them,” Rosa said in an interview. Otherwise, “bring the computer center cookies,” and ask to watch. 
“You need to know computers. You need to know someone who really knows computers,” he said.
In the same vein, Rosa emphasized that students should “forget Spanish, forget Chinese, forget Japanese … and learn Java or HTML5.”
Shoutside Media provides mobile website design and online advertising for companies looking to participate more effectively in the information age. Calling on the skills of computer programmers, Rosa has carved out a profitable niche in the media world.
According to Shoutside’s website, “Marketing does not just mean TV and Newspaper anymore. From YouTube ad campaigns to Facebook Like Gate promotions — we know what it takes to increase your social reach.”
“Understand that the Facebook news feed is the most read news feed in the world… Facebook will give you a lot of image, but will it give you $60,000 worth of image?” Rosa asked. 
That’s where Shoutside Media comes in. For most companies, the development and maintenance of a media presence doesn’t warrant a full-time position. Shoutside Media has a staff that will work with companies to create an effective online presence. 
For Rosa, career events such as the Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC) and the Business Opportunities Conference (BOC) last week failed to incite the traditional Carnegie Mellon nervousness and anticipation. 
By that time in his education, he already had a job: running SurhRosa.
From his position as a self-employed student, and his newfound perspective as a CEO, Rosa offered advice specific to job fairs and the recruitment process.
“You are at Carnegie Mellon, and that’s why we are here. We know you are fine. What we really need to know is ‘Do you make me feel good having you around?’ ”
Rosa recommended that students attending the TOC, BOC, or other job fairs break out of the traditional interview structure and “get recruiters to talk about themselves.”
Perhaps the most striking advice Rosa offered was directed toward presentation. Most students attending job fairs like the TOC and BOC aren’t yet employed, and it’s important to keep that in mind when applying for a position. 
“Be professional, but don’t be a professional. You’re not,” he said.

Money Scam
Sept. 16, 2013
A male Carnegie Mellon student filed a report regarding a money scam. According to the student, on Sept. 9, right after 2 a.m., a black woman in a white sedan pulled up next to the male and asked for gas. The woman told the student that she was an attorney named Paige who needed to get to the hospital to see her sick mother. The student gave the woman $40 in cash, thinking that the woman would reimburse him the next day. The student never received the money. Similar scams have been reported around the Oakland area over the last year.

Ex Officio Report
Thursday’s ex officio report came from Pascal Petter, director of dining services; Tom Caccavo, CulinArt regional district manager; and Larry Lee, associate dean of student affairs for operations. Lee and Petter, who are new to Carnegie Mellon, discussed their respective roles and their plans for dining and campus life.
Caccavo, Lee, and Petter also addressed current CulinArt contract negotiations and protests recently staged by CulinArt employees. The speakers took questions from several Senators about both the CulinArt protests and the future of housing and dining at Carnegie Mellon.
The speakers also discussed changes that they were planning to make to campus housing and dining, including a better system for getting comments and questions from students. 
Vacancy Elections
Two new Senators were inducted after this week’s vacancy elections. First-year CIT student Nkindé Ambalo and sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Nandini Ramakrishnan are now Senators. Ambalo and Ramakrishnan both gave brief speeches about their experience and motivation for being in Senate.
Ramakrishnan, as a sophomore, wanted to get involved in Senate her first year at Carnegie Mellon but only now has the time. 
Ambalo has extensive experience in student government and Model United Nations from his high school. 
Another vacancy election will be held next week for the empty seat in the Tepper School of Business. There are still three empty seats in CIT, three in CFA, and one in SCS.
Sergeant-at-Arms

The Bharatiya Janata Party announced last week that Narendra Modi would be its candidate for prime minister of India in the upcoming 2014 elections, according to The New York Times. Modi is the current chief minister of Gujarat, a western state of India, and one of the most controversial politicians in India today. Modi has supervised the improvement of Gujarat’s economy in the last decade, and wants to encourage Hindus to vote as a religious bloc, rather than be divided by caste. Caste division in India is analogous to racism in the United States, so subverting these divides would be a great step forward for India. However, Modi is also a Hindu radical who has been accused of encouraging the anti-Muslim riots that swept Gujarat in 2002. Because Muslims constitute roughly 13 percent of India’s population, having a prime minister with such virulent anti-Muslim sentiments will seriously damage the unity of India.
Back in 2002, anti-Muslim riots broke out barely a year into Modi’s ministership of Gujarat, in response to the deaths of 60 Hindus in a train fire, according to BBC News. Over a thousand people — 800 Muslims and 250 Hindus — died in the chaos. Citizens have gone so far as to accuse Modi not only of negligence, but of purposefully allowing the riots to continue. He was never charged, but several of his associates were convicted of inciting a riot.
These events took place, for the most part, over a decade ago, but many Indian Muslims still hate Modi with passion. This hatred intensified as more riots broke out in Uttar Pradesh last week after legislators from Modi’s party released a falsified video of Hindus being lynched by a Muslim mob, according to The New York Times. During the riots, 44 people died, and 42,000 people were displaced from their homes.
Despite the darker aspects of Modi’s political history, he has had some undeniable successes. One of his most visible victories is the economic strength of Gujarat today. Gujarat, which accounts for 5 percent of India’s population, produces 22 percent of its exports and 16 percent of its industrial products, according to The New York Times. According to the BBC, output from farms in Gujarat is nearly seven times the average in all of India, and its growth rate has remained in double digits for the past decade. While economic prosperity is a complex and multi-layered phenomenon, Gujarat’s fortune looks good for Modi’s campaign, especially when the Indian economy is looking shaky, according to The New York Times. Furthermore, Modi’s constituency resides in Maninagar, which is one of the most well-run and orderly neighborhoods in India. It has round-the-clock energy, functional streets, and a working sewage system. Maninagar is a wonderful place to live — except for the few Muslim communities within the town. These successes do not outweigh Modi’s history, but they do give him the appearance of a leader who can fix India’s ills.
Modi’s economic policy is not the only enticing aspect of his potential leadership. The minister wants to eliminate political barriers between castes as much as possible, creating a single Hindu voting bloc. One of the ways he plans on doing this is by focusing on young Hindu voters. In fact, he recently took to Twitter to encourage voters between ages 18 and 24 to register to vote, according to The Economic Times. For young people, Modi is a dynamic, impassioned leader who has the potential to both improve the economy and minimize caste divisions. Modi is even more appealing when compared to aging leaders of other parties, or to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who is 80 years old.
For a young Indian person, Modi’s message is incredibly appealing. He offers economic and political stability on a platter, and both of these things would make life easier in India. However, Modi is also dangerous because his message of unity is subtly tied to the discrimination of Muslim Indians. India, like America, is drifting toward being more politically polarized every day. While Hindus represent 80 percent of the Indian electorate, they have never bonded to form a political bloc because of caste divisions. If Modi can mobilize Hindus to act as a political unit, which he has the potential to do — especially with the lure of dynamic change and improved economic policy — they could very easily control Indian politics.
This cooperation would not be a bad thing. In fact, having India move past caste divisions would be a great cultural and political boon for the nation. If this cooperation is linked to anti-Muslim sentiment, however, it would eventually cause division among all Indians.

Older generations seem to always complain about younger ones, and the present older generation bears no exception.
It is not uncommon to find editorials or articles criticizing the millennial generation — those born from the late 1980s to around 2000. A 2008 op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, which refers to millennials as “trophy kids,” reports that many older managers view the millennial generation as more entitled and high-maintenance than previous generations. An article published last May in Time magazine focuses on the narcissism of the “me me me generation.” There is an overall notion that millennials are more self-absorbed and entitled than those who came before them.
This criticism, while harsh, is almost certainly true. 
Although it varies from case to case, it seems like the number of self-absorbed people has never been greater. Everybody wants others to read their daily Facebook statuses, Tumblr posts, and Twitter feeds. Some people need to take photos of themselves and their dog twice a day. Instant gratification, unwarranted self-importance, and first-world problems are abound.
This criticism is not just some anecdote-based gut feeling either. According to a study published in the American Psychological Association that analyzed values of people ranging from 18–40 years old, the millennials view money, fame, and image as more important than self-acceptance, affiliation, and community; they also have less concern for others and lower civic engagement than previous generations.
Given the way millennials were raised — myself included — it is  unsurprising that we turned out the way we did. For over a decade, we were told to expect more, want more, and feel better about ourselves.
Millennials were born in a time when it was good to be an American. The nation was strong and flourishing. We watched the Soviet Union fracture and fall while the United States became the strongest, freest, and most developed nation in the world. The American dream was more than a dream; it was taken for granted that, by the age of 30, a hardworking individual could have a stable job, a suburban home, and two or three kids.
This feel-good era was rife with feel-good values. Much fuss has been made about the “every child gets a trophy” mentality in school activities, but it is really only part of the larger self-esteem movement. A plethora of Disney movies told millennials to never settle for anything less than our hearts’ desires. Books and television shows told us to celebrate individuality. Schools were plastered with motivational posters that told us to dream big, disregard the naysayers, and never conform.
Each generation’s values are directly influenced by the society they grew up in — and with the advent of smartphones and social media to serve as enablers of self-promotion, it may very well be that the values of this generation are here to stay. However, with the nation still mired in war, recession, and political conflict, it is impossible to tell exactly what the next generation will be like. But the values of the millennial generation may constitute a new normal, and in time, people may have to reconsider what it means to be “self-absorbed.”

During the 2014 Miss America Pageant on Sept. 15, Nina Davuluri of Fayetteville, N.Y., became the first woman of Indian descent to be crowned Miss America. Following the announcement, riled pageant viewers unleashed a toxic deluge of racist and xenophobic tweets targeted at Davuluri’s win.
These tweets, some of which were complied on the popular website Buzzfeed, ranged from objections such as “I swear I’m not racist but this is America” to extremely offensive personal attacks calling Davuluri “Miss 7-11,” “Miss Terrorist,” and “Miss Al-Qaeda.” One person laughably claimed, “we all know Obama bought that pageant!”
As goes without saying, such comments are indefensibly bigoted and hopelessly illogical. President Obama is about as likely to have done a deal with Miss America pageant owner Donald Trump as Muslim extremists are likely to enter bikini-clad catwalk competitions. In addition to these people’s obvious errors is their utter misunderstanding of American values. America is a nation of immigrants.
Isn’t the idea of a great American melting pot among the first of the values that patriots and pageant contestants should represent? Comprised of many races and unique ethnic groups, the American population ought to prize diversity as much as any other national value — and certainly shouldn’t be protesting it.
Yet despite the outrageous nature of these tweets, and despite reactions to them ranging from righteous anger to mockery, one reaction has been almost nonexistent: surprise. Almost nobody, it seems, is in any way surprised by this gross display of racism; the incident has been described as a “tired theme” by CNN.
This lack of shock is among the most troubling aspects of this story. Racism of this kind is apparently commonplace enough that it is unsurprising even when it is written publicly with no concealment of identity.
According to a World Values Survey published this year, the population of America is among the least racist in the world, and yet Americans are quite used to racism. The national struggle against bigotry is clearly too far from won.
Certainly, enormous progress has been made in American culture’s overall standing with diversity. From the civil rights movement of the 1960s to modern-day immigration reform, Americans as a whole increasingly accept diversity and condemn prejudice. This positive trend will hopefully and probably continue. However, the nation has a long way to go until racist vitriol of the sort exhibited following the Miss America pageant is rare enough to be anomalous — preferably shocking and wholly impermissible.

To appreciate the disturbing gender divide in popular media, one only has to take a hard look at two of the most talked-about artists in recent months. Robin Thicke, the man behind “Blurred Lines,” and Miley Cyrus, who made news last week with her hit “Wrecking Ball,” almost beg for a comparison.
At first glance, the two artists seem radically different. Thicke is 36 years old and married, with almost two decades of experience in the music industry. Cyrus is only 20, and a former Disney Channel star.
It is highly disconcerting, however, that there is such a large disparity between the widespread condemnation of Cyrus and the comparatively minimal criticism of Robin Thicke for their work as artists, as well as their performance at the 2013 VMAs. It takes two to tango, but the phrase does not seem to apply to their performances. Cyrus was practically burned at the stake, but Thicke’s only regret after grinding on a girl 16 years his junior may have been that she stole the spotlight.
Lately it appears Cyrus has been doing everything in her power to scrub away her persistent image as America’s sweetheart. Needless to say, Cryus’s decision to take a ride on construction equipment in “Wrecking Ball” and to “twerk it out” in her single “We Can’t Stop” has been controversial. As a result, the wholesome sweetness of Hannah Montana has been erased.
But perhaps that is the point. What right do people have to dictate the career choices of a performer in the midst of redefining herself? Horrified fans of a younger Cyrus would have her stay stagnant, crying foul at the shearing of her trademark wavy locks, and at her provocative wardrobe. They throw around words like “slut,” “trashy,” and “pathetic.”
Such treatment is not only unrealistic, but grossly unfair. Many people fail to recognize that the celebrities they fall in love with are liable (and justified) to change. In pushing boundaries, Cyrus is creating an unforgettable buzz, gathering a new fanbase, and establishing herself as a performer with staying power. Frankly, it does not matter if a million people find Cyrus’s clothing distasteful and her actions crude. She has the right as an artist to make choices about how she wants to be perceived, as well as a right as a woman to do with her body what she will.
While Cyrus has been criticized for her performance and rapidly changing image, Thicke has enjoyed resounding popularity for the blatantly misogynistic “Blurred Lines.” The song hides behind a smooth beat and annoying catchiness, but the closer one looks, the less it sounds like sexy dance music and more like an endorsement for sexual assault. 
Lines like “I know you want it,” “I’m gonna take a good girl,” and “Do it like it hurt,” resemble classic justification for sexual assault. Thicke’s song promotes the destructive idea that consent itself is a blurred line.
Nowhere is the contrast between Thicke and Cyrus more apparent than in the music videos for their latest respective hits. The uncensored music video for “Blurred Lines” features Thicke fully dressed and in control as a trio of topless models clad only in nude G-strings strut around for his viewing pleasure. Cyrus similarly strips down in her “Wrecking Ball” video, but while Thicke and the models have taken relatively little abuse for their display, Cyrus has been mercilessly vilified for daring to show her body.
This huge difference in public reaction is telling. Our media-saturated generation has become numb to Thicke’s brand of misogyny. Objectification of women is nothing new to us. Cyrus’s exhibition in her “Wrecking Ball” video is an instance not of a woman being sexualized by the media, but choosing to place herself in a position of sexual power. Maybe this choice is unusual enough that the public rejected it offhand.
Whatever the underlying cause behind Thicke’s praise and Cyrus’s criticism is, it might be useful to take away this: Knee-jerk reactions often deserve a second look. The next catchy song could glorify something terrible, and the next wild pop star could just be growing up.

The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board is spending $70,000 to cut down on underage drinking in Oakland, Squirrel Hill’s Rep. Dan Frankel told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. The money was split into two grants, with $40,000 going to the Oakland Planning and Development Corporation, and the remaining $30,000 going to Carnegie Mellon’s University Police.
The allocation for the Oakland Planning and Development Corporation will be used to hire off-duty police officers to crack down on alcohol-related crimes and code violations. They will gather data on drinking to target outreach programs with landlords and students. The executive director of the corporation, Wanda Wilson, said that she will crack down on pay-to-enter house parties, which promote dangerous drinking. University Police will use its share to provide additional training for officers, and pay for increased underage drinking patrols.
Underage drinking is a concern at Carnegie Mellon, as it is at every institution of higher learning, but a focus on catching students seems to miss the point. While breaking up large house parties to reduce high-risk drinking is worthwhile, spending more money on catching students is unlikely to deter them from drinking in significant ways.
The money might be better spent educating students about alcohol in more effective ways, and giving them better risk assessment tools for the still-likely event that they drink. Online alcohol education is the punchline of many jokes on campus, and for good reason. Every year students find ways to skip the inconceivably outdated videos. The quizzes are no real guarantee of understanding and students have little motivation to do the program — even less to invest in how they do it. 
Providing more engaged learning may deter drinking more than crackdowns would. More hands-on learning, possibly through a single weekend class, could give students more motivation to digest the material presented to them traditionally through online programs.
Carnegie Mellon’s University Police and the Oakland Planning and Development Corporation should not waste money working to reduce drinking significantly; students will continue to drink, and may resort to more risky drinking in less suitable locations than houses, in response to crackdowns. Risky drinking could be made riskier in unsafe locations. Instead, the grants should go toward helping students drink more responsibly.

Carnegie Mellon held its annual Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC) and Business Opportunities Conference (BOC) last week, where students dressed professionally and perfected their résumés in search of employment or summer internships from about 300 recruiters.
There’s no denying that the TOC and BOC are invaluable resources for Carnegie Mellon students, and ones that the student body may often take for granted — but the timing of these events limits job and internship opportunities for some students due to conflicting academic schedules.
The TOC and BOC are held from 10:30 a.m.–5 p.m. on their scheduled days — Tuesday and Wednesday for the TOC and Thursday for the BOC. For students who have days filled with classes, finding time to search for an internship or employment opportunity at these conferences is problematic. Students may have to rush to the University Center during a short break between their classes, sometimes foregoing their lunch to do so. They might even miss class to attend these events.
Academic schedules should not limit the opportunities students have to obtain jobs or internships during the TOC and BOC.
Professors should strive to become more understanding of potential conflicts with the TOC and BOC, and permit students to miss class for the conferences, or at the very least not schedule exams on the same day as one of these events. 
Alternatively, it may be possible to change the times during which the TOC and BOC are held. Recruiters often stay overnight for the job fairs, so it is worth exploring the option of holding these events after standard class hours — perhaps from 4–8 p.m. With times in the evening, a far greater number of students may have the opportunity to attend these important events without rushing through them.
The TOC and BOC are great opportunities that benefit Carnegie Mellon students. However, to curb people from missing classes or recruitment events, professors must either adapt their courses to allow students to miss classes on these days, or the university should work to move the TOC and BOC to more accessible hours.

Recently, Netflix revealed that it adds movies and television shows to its catalog based on which media people most often stream or download from piracy websites, according to BBC News.
This move by Netflix obviously benefits the company and producers — they gain revenue and customers that they would otherwise lose to piracy sites — but it also benefits viewers, particularly college students. Piracy can be more effectively combatted if major streaming services work toward the same goal.
While there is debate over whether piracy helps or hurts viewership, Netflix ensures that viewers already paying for their subscription service do not resort to illegal (and often unreliable) websites with pop-up advertisements or computer virus threats, such as The Pirate Bay. On these sites, users have to sort through links for what they deem to be the most reliable third-party hosts. In contrast to these sites, Netflix provides users with a reliable hub of television shows and movies for a relatively low monthly price — $7.99.
For college students, this budget-friendly subscription is a viable and welcome alternative to piracy sites. The subscription costs less than $100 each year. However, a paid subscription often cannot compete with the free option, despite any risks associated with it.
Regardless, Netflix rewards customers by providing them with wanted content. Some users may still use piracy sites to find content that Netflix does not carry, but the service is aiming to reduce visits to these sites by anticipating and researching what their users want. Other video streaming services, like Hulu and Amazon Instant Video, could benefit their customers by doing similar research. By combining forces to ensure that popular television shows and movies are available to the largest audience possible, these services should decrease visits to piracy sites.
According to The Guardian, Kevin Spacey — star of the Netflix original series House of Cards — said during the Edinburgh Television Festival, “The audience wants control. They want freedom. If they want to binge ... then we should let them binge.”
The iTunes store has thrived off the concept of giving users easy access to content when they want it. Apple stocks its library full with movies and music that are accessible on various platforms. By researching which television shows and movies are most often pirated, streaming services like Netflix give users similar control to binge on the content they want.
