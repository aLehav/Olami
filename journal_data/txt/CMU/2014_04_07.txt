The Carnegie Mellon track and field teams hosted another tournament this weekend. Both squads placed second at the Carnegie Mellon University Quad Meet, and several individual athletes took home first place titles.
The women’s track and field team was looking to rebound after last week’s disappointing fourth place finish. The Tartans came out with a vengeance and took it out in the throwing events. Seniors Samantha Oleson and Colette Tano finished first and second in the hammer throw with tosses of 39.52 and 39.40 meters, respectively. Junior Sasha Spalding followed up by taking second place in the shot put with a throw of 10.74 meters.
Spalding continued her dominance with a win in the long jump after leaping over the competition with a distance of 4.84 meters. First-year Rebecca Fortner added another strong jumping finish as she took home second in the high jump, bounding 1.50 meters in the air.
On the track side, senior Jacqueline Guevel led the way with a pair of victories in the 100- and 400-meter hurdles. Guevel sprinted her way to the finish line with times of 16.13 and 1:04.75, respectively.
Sophomores Elizabeth Snyder and Haley Bryant both helped the team effort with strong individual efforts in distance running. Snyder took home first in the 3,000-meter run with a time of 10:44.33, while Bryant finished the 800-meter run in 2:29.86 for second place.
The men’s team continued on its blistering pace, setting several career bests, but ultimately falling short of repeating a first place finish as a team.
Senior Zachary Erra-Hernandez continued his domination of the competition, breaking his own school record from last weekend in the hammer toss by over .5 meters with a throw of 54.53. Senior Nathan Cheek and junior Gino Pilato helped round out a one, two, three finish with throws of 51.59 and 39.98, respectively.
The Tartan throwers kept up the dominance with Erra-Hernandez winning both the shot put and discus titles with throws of 15.80 and 44.38, respectively. 
Cheek finished second in the discus with a 43.92 toss while senior David Markowitz took home the title in the javelin throw with a career best 52.09-meter throw.
To round out the field events, first-year Kyle Weaver and sophomore Victor Yan took second and third in the pole vault, each clearing the 3.95-meter bar.
The Tartans did not let up when the time came for the track events, starting with a sweep of the 3,000-meter run. First-year Ryan Archer and sophomore Grant Langevin, along with junior George Degen, helped the Tartans take their second one, two, three finish of the meet, finishing with times of 8:59.70, 9:00.44, and 9:04.40 respectively.
Carnegie Mellon also dominated the steeplechase and 1,500-meter run, taking home first and third in both events. First-year Curtis Watro took home the title in the steeplechase at 10:04.40, and sophomore Brian Bollens finished just behind with a time of 10:35.13. 
In the 1,500-meter run, first-year Owen Norley finished in 4:03.02 to take home first while sophomore Marc-Daniel Julien placed third with a time of 4:06.74.
In the short distance events, the Tartans netted three second place finishes. First-year Andrew Chang placed second in the 100-meter dash with a time of 11.79, while senior Mike Standish grabbed second in the 400-meter dash after crossing the line with a time of 57.57. First-year Nathan Willis rounded out the trio with a second-place finish of 2:01.43 in the 800-meter run.
The Tartans took home one more title in the 4x400-meter relay with Julien, Standish, Willis, and Norley combining to take home first with the time of 3:26.43.
Both squads will be splitting up next weekend, with parts of each team traveling to the Bucknell University Distance Carnival and the rest competing in the Bennie Benson Memorial Invitational hosted at Robert Morris University.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s tennis teams traveled to Case Western Reserve University on Saturday, and both came home with victories.
The 11th-ranked men’s team was the underdog against 8th-ranked Case Western, but managed to pull out the victory after they fell behind 3–0 after the doubles matches. The Tartans then came back and took five of six singles matches to claim the 5–4 victory. Juniors Christian Heaney-Secord and Will Duncan both pulled out victories in three sets, winning 4–6, 6–2, 6–3 and 7–5, 1–6, 7–5, respectively.
The three first-years Kiril Kirkov, Kunal Wadwani, and Kenny Zheng came up big for the Tartans, with Wadwani and Zheng both winning in straight sets, 6–3, 6–2 and 6–3, 7–6 (9) and Kirkov coming from behind to win his match 6–7, 7–6, and 7–5.
The women’s tennis team, ranked ninth in the nation, had a much easier time against the 27th-ranked Case Western squad. In a reversal from the men’s match, the Tartans took a 3–0 coming out of the doubles matches. Junior Bryn Raschke and first-year Vanessa Pavia came back from a 5–4 deficit to win 8–5 while the tandems of senior Katie Cecil and sophomore Brooke Tsu and junior Angela Pratt and first-year Nicholle Torres had an easier time, winning 8–3 and 8–5, respectively.
In the singles matches, Pratt, Pavia and Cecil all won in straight sets to quickly secure the victory for the Tartans. Pavia only surrendered one game all match winning 6–1, 6–0. Pratt and Cecil, while not as dominating, still cruised to easy victories — 6–4, 6–1 and 6-1, 6–4, respectively.
The women’s team next competes on April 18 when they host Duquesne University, while the men’s team is back in action on April 19th when they host Kenyon College.

Every year, the month of April tends to bring out an uneasy sense of excitement among soccer fans. It’s the time of the year when their team is either fighting for their lives to stay in the top-tier of soccer, fighting for European qualification, or in the race to win a cup. One of these cups is the UEFA Champions League (UCL), the most prestigious club competition in soccer. The UCL quarterfinals first-leg games were played out last week: who will make the semifinals to move one step closer to securing the dream win?
Real Madrid vs. Borussia Dortmund
This tie is probably the only one that is definitely over after the first leg. Madrid oozed class in the first leg played at the Santiago Bernabéu and destroyed Dortmund, who had keeper Roman Weidenfeller to thank for keeping the score line respectable. Wingers Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo scored two of the goals, and expect them to be in the mix again at the Signal Iduna Park. The midfield three of Luka Modrić, Ángel di María, and Xabi Alonso seemed to control the game and the same is expected at the Westfalenstadion. Dortmund is nothing resembling the side that destroyed Madrid 4–1 at the same stadium last season, and while the scorer of all four of those goals Robert Lewandowski will return, even that score line would not put them through this time.
Winner: Madrid. This injury-ravaged Dortmund side is never getting past Carlo Ancelotti’s side.
Manchester United vs. Bayern Munich
They say Manchester United never die. This matchup proves that saying, as even after facing defending European champions Bayern Munich in a hugely disappointing season behind them, Manchester United is not dead, but rather very much alive in the quarterfinals of the Champions League. United’s home form had been nothing short of atrocious and Bayern’s form scintillated everywhere. Credit is in order for David Moyes, who pulled off one of the best performances of the season for his team, but that still does not reduce the magnitude of the task at hand. Bayern has the away goal advantage at this stage and United might be shorn of top goal scorer and talisman Wayne Rooney for the game. The team is already missing key forward Robin van Persie. Bayern is without key personnel too, as midfielders Bastian Schweinsteiger and Javi Martínez will miss the game through suspensions picked up in the first leg, while Thiago Alcântara is injured. However, Bayern has probably the strongest and deepest squad in the world, as the likes of Mario Götze, Toni Kroos, and Dante will step in to replace the above while United has no one near that quality. United did beat their opponents 4–0 on the weekend and Bayern did lose for the first time in 53 games in the Bundesliga, but for United to pull this off would be nothing short of a miracle.
Winner: Bayern. United have a stupendous away record, but betting against a team that wrapped up their league title in March would be just be ignorant.
Paris St.-Germain vs. Cheslea
One of the games that was exceptionally hard to predict was made easier to do so with Paris St.-Germain’s (PSG) stunning performance and Chelsea’s equally pathetic show in the first leg. Chelsea manager José Mourinho’s decision to not play a striker and instead play attacker André Schürrle up top backfired spectacularly and his public derision of his strikers after the game couldn’t have helped their confidence. Chelsea was particularly awful in the final third, and PSG took their chances equally well, coming away with an important two-goal cushion. It would be wrong to count Chelsea out however, as PSG will be missing their best player in striker Zlatan Ibrahimović for the second leg. Edinson Cavani is more than able backup, but should Chelsea manage to keep a clean sheet, a 2–0 win would mean they go through.
Winner: Chelsea. Reason 1: Mourinho has never lost at the quarterfinals in the UCL. Reason 2: Mourinho knows how to win this tournament.
Barcelona vs. Atlético Madrid
This matchup was the hardest to call, and remains so. In their four games so far this season, there have been two 0–0 draws and two 1–1 draws. Barca and Atlético have not been split this season and its probably why they are currently the two top teams in the La Liga. These two teams will likely battle it out for the La Liga title on the very last day, and the winner of the second leg could very well win the UCL title as well. Atlético Madrid have the advantage, as Atlético midfielder Diego’s stunning goal at the Camp Nou gave them the away goal they needed, while forward Neymar continued his run as the only Barca player to score against Atlético this season. Barca has the x-factor though in forward Lionel Messi, arguably reaching the same form that made him the best player in the world before his injury this season. Atlético, though, have not lost at home this season and conceded two goals only to Real Madrid at the Vicente Calderón Stadium. Barca will need their best players to be on top form, and manager Tata Martino must get his tactics right, else Diego Simeone’s team will move one step closer to the impossible.
Winner: Atlético Madrid. Madrid will win only by a whisker only though — because this means no Messi and Barca in the semifinals for the first time in six years.

To start, I have to thank Ben Matzke for helping me last year to get my annual thoughts on buggy out there. This year, however, I’ve opted to go back to the good old ways.
This year has been quite the interesting one. We’ve seen some new additions to the buggy fleet with a few buggies mysteriously disappearing from competition, but that aside, the field is more level this year than I would have predicted while watching fall rolls. Well, that is, if you’re not counting SDC. As a hint, going forward into predictions, you’re going to see those letters come up very often. Let the fun commence.
In the women’s division, we’ll watch the powerhouse that is SDC A walk away with a (nearly) uncontested first place finish. There is potential for them to break the 2:30 barrier. Their competition will be from Fringe A, who will be looking to close the gap after last year’s performance. Both teams have solid pushers to follow up the even faster buggies from those organizations. Things will get a little lazy between CIA A and SDC B, but I believe the willpower of the CIA women will edge out SDC B for their respective third and fourth place finishes. Last year, we saw a third place finish from PiKA A, narrowly ahead of CIA and SDC, but this year, I haven’t seen much of their pushers and expect them to roll into fifth place, relying heavily on PiKA mechanics. At the bottom of the pack, I expect a dark horse candidate out of Sig Ep A.
Before I share my thoughts on the men’s division, I want to say that this year will have all the excitement one could imagine. The spring rolls started very late, and I have yet to see raceday-quality speeds from any organization. Moreover, course quality has been rapidly degrading to the point that drivers have the joy of zigzagging through cones every morning. 
That in itself isn’t too hard, but knowing other treacherous potholes on the course must be holding back drivers and mechanics alike. So with drivers coming down the course faster than they have all semester combined with abysmal road surfaces, expect to see shuddered wheels and spun-out buggies in the chute this coming raceday — on to men’s predictions.
Barely making it to day two, I expect to see SDC C come back weaker than last year. This time, I doubt there will be as many disqualifications to boost their place. 
Having an additional year with their driver, PiKA B will likely squeak into a ninth place finish. Look for Fringe B to come in eighth with one of their faster buggies. CIA A will be safely into day two with a seventh place finish above all the backup B and C teams. Recently having put a new buggy on the course, we’ll see if their pushers are equally motivated as their mechanics. 
Spirit A is a team with everything to win and hopefully their driver will display as much skill as their pushers have speed. They will land short of the top five with a sixth place finish. Inevitably, that spot will be stolen by SDC B. The indomitable SDC will surely use one of their experienced drivers and sleek buggies to propel the second team into fifth place. PiKA A will end up disappointing, with another poor showing in the pushing department. Their SDC-esque buggy is going to dominate the downhill, but when we’re in the top five, a fast buggy will never be fast enough. That’s because there are still some competitors to be reckoned with, such as Fringe A, who will not make the same mistake as they did last year. Sending their top buggy and top driver with a quality push team can secure them some third place hardware. Sig Ep A, who jumped up the rankings in 2013, will surely be motivated to keep that next-to-top spot; they have shown signs that they are ready to fight for it and will hold onto it, at least for this year. 
With no further delay, as you may have predicted yourself, SDC A will cruise across the finish line with the coveted first place trophy waiting for them. Buffered by a five-second gap between first and second last year, SDC will have their eyes off the rearview mirror and zoned in on the clock.
Good luck to the teams and enjoy the races. I look forward to seeing you all on raceday, although you’ll never see me.
Predictions:
Men's:
1) SDC A
2) Sig Ep A
3) Fringe A
4) PiKA A
5) SDC B
6) Spirit A
7) CIA A
8) Fringe B

According to The Boston Globe, on April 15, 2013, three people were killed and over 260 others injured during the Boston Marathon bombing. In relation to the tragedy, Yu-Ru Lin, an assistant professor of the School of Information Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh, as well as a Bostonian herself, presented a Human-Computer Interaction seminar lecture last Wednesday, titled “The Diffusion of Fear, Comfort, and Solidarity during the Boston bombing.” In the lecture, she used Twitter data to study how communities are affected by tragedies.
“How do we examine fear, its diffusion, and its relationship to other community dynamics?” posed Lin at the beginning of her lecture. She explained that past studies on how catastrophes affect communities rely mainly on surveys, which are unreliable because of time lag and memory bias. 
Instead, Lin’s approach uses data obtained from geocoded tweets: “Social media, like Twitter, allows me to sample large populations and study how people respond to real world events. This immediate response would avoid biases of memories.” Lin also noted that the data from these tweets allows her to study larger geographical areas.
She used over 180 million tweets which came from 95 of the largest cities in the world — 60 from the United States and 35 from other countries.
One focus of Lin’s study was fear. In order to determine which tweets express fear and which do not, Lin used the fear lexicon, a collection of words that linguists have determined to be associated with fear. 
As an example, Lin explained that in the tweet, “What the hell just happened in Boston?” the word “hell” would contribute to the tweet’s fear index. To demonstrate the validity of this method of indexing, Lin showed that on a graph of fear indices versus time, tweets from the city of Boston showed peaks on the day of the bombing, as well as a few days later, when a manhunt occurred.
To determine how the fear felt by Bostonians corresponded to the fear felt by people living outside Boston, Lin studied shared fear. “To study how people’s fear response is similar to that of the people from Boston, we computed a shared fear as the temporal correlation of fear indices after the bombing,” Lin explained.
Lin also focused on two types of social support: comfort and solidarity. Comfort was measured by the frequency the hashtag #prayforboston was used, and solidarity was measured by the frequency the hashtag #bostonstrong was used.
In Lin’s study, she endeavored to use tweets from the two weeks prior to the Boston Marathon bombing to predict the amount of fear, comfort, and solidarity that was observed in cities outside of Boston after the bombing. The factors which Lin used to try to make these predictions were geoproximity (how close someone lived to Boston), social connections (the strength of social connections, based on the number of replies sent between cities), and visits (if a person visited Boston recently). She looked at these factors both individually and in combinations.
Using these models, Lin discovered that the personal visit factor had the greatest impact on whether a person from outside Boston felt fear during the same periods that Bostonians were feeling fear. She also found that the geo-social combination model was the best predictor for solidarity, although when she looked at just cities which were far from Boston, the best predictor was the visit factor. The best predictor for comfort was, again, the visit factor.
But how does shared fear correspond to comfort and solidarity? Lin found that fear is significantly associated with solidarity, but not with comfort. “So what this means is that, holding other factors constant, cities with more shared fear tend to show more solidarity,” Lin said. This result is interesting, because it suggests that fear could have a productive role in social support.
Although Lin’s study offers a comprehensive picture of community dynamics following the Boston Marathon bombing, she ended her talk with an invitation for collaboration with Carnegie Mellon researchers to further improve the study.

Last Tuesday, on April Fool’s Day, the Association of Computational Heresy (ACH) held its eighth annual SIGBOVIK conference, a tongue-in-cheek, computer-science-themed conference, in a packed Rashid Auditorium. The conference showcased papers about fake, though humorous, research in computer science submitted by students and faculty. In the words of one of the presenters, “This is a really good year for attendance! I think this might be the first year that we announced the food.”
Emcee Tom Murphy VII (SCS ‘07), began by welcoming the audience to “SIGBOVIK 1,000” — a play on the fact that the number eight is 1,000 in binary. He then showcased a web application, “SIGBOVIK plays Twitch plays Pokémon plays SIGBOVIK,” where the audience members could press keys to change the posture of a stick figure on the screen, in a manner similar to Twitch plays Pokémon, a crowdsourced social experiment in which Pokémon is played via the video-streaming website Twitch by parsing commands from users worldwide. Murphy stipulated that the SIGBOVIK presenters must maintain the same stance as the stick figure on the screen at all times while presenting, which was how the contraption in turn “played SIGBOVIK”. Murphy then called on the first speaker, Jim McCann (SCS ‘10), who now creates video games on his own website, TCHOW (The Chicken’s House of Wacky).
McCann introduced himself as associated with TCHOW LLC, and began with a 30-second description of his latest game, TCHOW Rainbow. He went on to discuss cryptographically-sound jokes and optimality of jokes, but kept returning to this introduction and 30-second plug after every few slides, adding to the hilarity of the presentation. One of the funniest parts of his presentation was the following cryptographically-sound joke, that was also published in the conference proceedings:
“What do you call a predatory fish, endorsed by the NIST and NSA?”
“A 6265a4a07968a7c1df16a61004fb7191177cafd4, of course.”
This huge string is actually SHA (‘rk’), where SHA, or Secure Hash Algorithm, is a hash function commonly used in cryptography. McCann also discussed the structure of a joke, proposing that a joke was composed of a “set up” and a “punch line” and depicted this structure using a logical system. He also gave various examples of optimal jokes, including “knock-knock” and “reverse knock-knock” jokes.
Patrick Xia, a Ph.D. student in computer science, presented DollarCoin, a new cryptocurrency, as an alternative to Bitcoin. DollarCoin is mined, or generated, by burning a $1 bill, while taking a video of the burning process in a specified manner. In his paper, Xia proves that burning the bill in this specified manner ensures that the currency cannot be forged or double spent. The highlight of Xia’s presentation was a demonstration of this process of generating a DollarCoin, taking a dollar bill out of his pocket and lighting it on fire.
Stefan Muller, a second-year Ph.D. student in computer science, demonstrated a new and better web browser. Muller believes that standard browsers are inefficient pieces of software because they use a lot of memory, display advertisements, and are prone to security vulnerabilities. He declared that the root of the problem was the features in the web browser, because “every time you add a new feature to a browser, you’re slowing your browser down, hogging more CPU resources and potentially you’re introducing bugs into the software.” Muller’s solution is Aluminum, the world’s fastest and most secure browser, with no extra features beyond the necessary functions of a web browser. 
Muller displayed his own website using the browser and it turned out to be just plain text, not the nicely-rendered pages that we usually see on a browser. According to Muller, rendering a website is a “feature,” hence not part of this minimalist browser. He then went on to show how chunks of the website could be viewed on his phone, using text messages. This demonstration led to a great deal of amusement among the audience, due to the fact that all the chunks of his website didn’t actually show up via text message, and even if they had, it didn’t look like they were sent in a particular order.
This humor-filled conference contained several opportunities for laughter. For more laughs, the conference proceedings can be found at http://sigbovik.org/2014/proceedings.pdf.

In recent years, Missouri-based chemical company Monsanto has generated nearly-endless negative press associated with their genetically modified Roundup Ready crops. The crops, despite not being Monsanto’s primary products, are designed to be pesticide- and herbicide-resistant or even produce their own pesticides. This ability theoretically allows crops to have a higher survival rate, allowing a higher yield for farmers. The crops are incredibly controversial and have come under fire for being a threat to everything from human health to scientific research. However, high profile public battles like the one over genetically modified organisms (GMOs) produce many myths on both sides, making the heart of the Monsanto debate very hard to access.
The major genetically modified crops created by Monsanto are designed to withstand Monsanto pesticides. While very few crops have actually been commercially released by Monsanto (Roundup Ready versions of corn, canola, cotton, soybeans, squash, and papaya, to be exact), these crops account for a huge share of agriculture and the effects of the pesticides can be devastating. The increase in pesticides has created large populations of pesticide-resistant insects. This leads to Monsanto nearly fighting an arms race every year with bugs that are becoming increasingly resistant to Roundup and other chemicals used to kill pests and weeds. These population changes could drastically affect ecosystems, as well as the increase in foreign chemicals as local flora and fauna fail to adapt. Another threat to local ecosystems is Monsanto seeds that are blown out of the confines of the farms on which they are grown, which could also lead to contamination with local populations and change the landscape very quickly.
Monsanto has also come under fire for what is called the Terminator Gene, according to NPR, with claims that Monsanto seeds are sterile. People argue that these sterile seeds force farmers to continuously buy Monsanto seeds rather than replanting the ones already produced. While Monsanto has isolated the Terminator Gene, they deny using it in their crops. 
Further, buying new seeds each year is a common practice for farmers. The Terminator Gene can also help prevent Monsanto crops from acting as invasive species, as the seeds terminate and cannot grow.
Another thing muddling this debate is a common tendency to equate Monsanto and GMOs. While companies like DuPont are also part of the market, Monsanto holds a massive amount of the market share, and it is very difficult for GMO producing companies to start up because the negative press of Monsanto has spread to GMOs. GMOs are widely disliked, largely because of some of Monsanto’s business practices, but mostly anti-GMO sentiment has fueled the charge against Monsanto. However, under closer examination it seems Monsanto has used the concept of GMOs for its own gain and not for the benefits that GMOs can yield. 
GMOs have been used for extremely positive purposes. One example is golden rice, a form of rice genetically modified to contain vitamin A in order to help regions where vitamin A deficiencies are extremely common. The production of the rice has been met with mass resistance, as both environmental groups and protesters have uprooted crops and prevented the spread of the product. This resistance stems from a general resistance to GMOs, as golden rice has undergone extensive testing and has been determined to be safe both to eat and for the environment. It is clear that most of the world refuses to eat genetically modified crops despite the scientific urge to do otherwise.
The most common concern with GMOs is the health risk often associated with genetically modified foods. Many scientists tend to believe that GMOs are not inherently dangerous, but there is a very vocal minority who say they are. A common example is a 2012 study by Gilles-Éric Séralini linking Monsanto corn crops to cancer in rats. For a vast number of reasons, this study was retracted, and GMOs are likely safe to eat, but that is not the end of the debate. These general defenses of GMOs are not always specific to Monsanto. Often, Monsanto genetically modifies crops to solve problems that wouldn’t exist without Monsanto, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of need for Monsanto products. 
Further, Monsanto’s use of patent laws makes it extremely difficult to research the exact effect Monsanto’s crops can have. Researchers need permission from the company to conduct studies. While claims of Monsanto suing people because their crop blew into a garden stems from a sensationalized version of one lawsuit, something similar happens with scientific research where Monsanto will often refuse to give people the rights to research their products.
Genetically modified organisms and Monsanto, at the end of the day, are different. Monsanto is a chemical company producing pesticides and herbicides to help kill everything in someone’s garden that isn’t a crop. They make crops designed so that their products do not kill the crops too. 
However, with massive public resistance to GMOs, these crops seem to be what we get from GMOs for the near future. With the potential of foods that can make more land arable and arable land more efficient, a company that designs foods that only survive their own products holds a massive share of the market, coming close to a monopoly. As time goes on, will GMOs ever reach their full potential, or has Monsanto poisoned the well?
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science, technology, and medicine on society. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

When the first laser was produced on May 16, 1960, it was described as a solution looking for a problem. Today, however, lasers are involved in many standard procedures including surgery, manufacturing, and reading barcodes and compact discs.
The science behind lasers is based in the structure of atoms. Atoms contain a nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by electrons in what is called an electron cloud. The electron cloud can be understood as many different orbits, often called energy levels, around the nucleus. When energy, often in the form of heat, is added to an atom, electrons are moved from their ground state energy level to a higher energy level. This state is called an excited state. Electrons in an excited state want to return to their ground state energy level. To return to this level, the electrons will release energy in the form of a photon, which is a particle of light.
The word laser is actually an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. This term is a concise way of saying that lasers control how atoms release photons. 
According to LIGHTFAIR International, laser light differs from normal light in three important ways: It is monochromatic, coherent, and directional. The term monochromatic means that the light consists of only one wavelength of light. Each wavelength of light corresponds to a specific color of light, and the wavelength of light is determined by the energy state of the electron and the amount of energy released. The term coherent means that each photon moves in unison with the other photons in an organized manner. Finally, the term directional signifies that the light is released in only one direction, which makes the beam strong and concentrated.
In order to produce laser light instead of normal light, stimulated emission, or organized emission, must occur. According to howstuffworks.com, this process begins when a burst of light or electrical discharge raises atoms in the lasing medium to an energy level about two or three levels above their ground-state energy level. In order to return to their ground state, these electrons emit photons of light. 
Stimulated emission occurs when one photon of light encounters an electron in the same energy level as the original electron that created the first photon. When this happens, the first photon causes the electron to emit a second photon of light with the same wavelength and direction as the original photon.
This effect is enhanced by a pair of mirrors located on either end of the lasing medium. These mirrors cause the photons of light to reflect back and forth through the lasing medium. As they travel back and forth, the photons encounter other electrons and cause them to emit photons of the same wavelength and direction. This process ensures that the light is monochromatic, coherent, and directional. One of the mirrors at one end of the laser is “half-silvered,” which means that it reflects some light and allows some light to pass through. The light that passes through this mirror is the light that we see as the laser.
While all lasers perform this general function, lasers have been split into many different categories. The type of laser is often determined by the lasing medium. Lasing mediums can be solids, liquids, gases, or semiconductors. Some common laser types include solid-state lasers, gas lasers, excimer lasers (with reactive gas laser mediums), dye lasers (with complex organic dye laser mediums), and semiconductor lasers. Each of these types of lasers is able to perform slightly different functions. According to howstuffworks.com, gas lasers are often used to cut hard materials, whereas semiconductor lasers are often used in laser printers.
Lasers have already become an integral part of our daily life, and will continue to affect the fields of science and technology in the future.

Gene editing cures mice of disease
The CRISPR-Cas system, developed by researchers affiliated with The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has shown to correct a genetic mutation in mice by using gene-snipping machinery from bacteria. With this technology, a DNA-cutting enzyme binds to a specific sequence close to the mutation. The enzyme is then able to cut the DNA and then paste a correct, non-mutated version of the gene into place. Using this method, researchers were able to correct a mutation in live mice that results in the inability to break down the amino acid tyrosine. 
The hope is that one day this technology can be used to cure single-gene disorders in humans.

Geologic clock finds age of moon
An international team of planetary scientists has determined that the moon formed around 100 million years after the solar system began. The international research team set up hundreds of simulations of the growth history for planets similar to Earth. By looking at growth simulations for Earth-like planets, they found a relationship between the time Earth was impacted to create the moon and the amount of material added afterward. By adding information about the mass of the Earth to the simulations, a “clock” was found in the data. Previous research provided data on the mass of the Earth post-impact.

Researchers reset immune systems
Researchers at Emory University have tested a method that “reboots” one’s immune system on 20 patients undergoing kidney transplants. Normally, when a patient undergoes an organ transplant, he or she must take an intense drug cocktail to keep the immune system from attacking the new organ. The treatment begins with a drug, inserted intravenously, that significantly decreases the amount of white blood cells. These cells “regrow” over the next year, and this time they accept the new organ. Doctors give a monthly injection of a drug that helps the white blood cells accept the new organ even more; another drug is given to suppress some of the old cells which might attack.

Ebola outbreak in Western Africa
An outbreak of the Ebola virus has taken the lives of more than 80 people in Western Africa, mostly in the country of Guinea. The World Health Organization reports a total of 137 cases. Doctors Without Borders has been attempting to educate citizens about how Ebola is spread, as well as help train medical personnel that may have to deal with infected patients. Genetic analysis has indicated that the strain of this outbreak is most closely related to the strain Ebola-Zaire, considered one of the most deadly of Ebola strains.
Ebola causes hemorrhagic fever and has a mortality rate of over 60 percent.

Transgenic trees better for biofuels
A recent article published in Nature shows that transgenic poplar trees are easier to break down to make paper and biofuels. Lignin, a tough polymer found in trees, is usually the most difficult part of the plant to break down when making biofuels or paper. The transgenic poplar trees, however, have a form of lignin that is easier to break down.
“The potential for saving energy is so high that this change should be considered in every plant that’s destined to be pulped or converted to biofuel,” said Professor of biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison John Ralph, an author of the paper. Ralph and his team have filed patent applications for the genetically modified poplars.

Muscles controlled by reaction to light
Scientists have developed a new way to control muscles with light. 
The research, developed at the University College London, involves transplanting synthetic motor neurons into nerve endings. The neurons are made from stem cells and react to blue light; scientists can control the muscle function depending on frequency, intensity, and pulse of the light. These cells may help individuals with diseases that affect motor neurons and cause paralysis, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Saturday night saw Rangos Hall in the University Center transformed from a dull and unassuming space into an electrifying celebration of culture, beauty, fashion, and art thanks to the 2014 SPIRIT Fashion Show. Going beyond the typical fashion show format to combine all forms of performance, the show was more than a showcase of clothing, but rather a statement on numerous social issues related to discrimination and the lingering feelings of hatred that course through the blood of America.
The theme for the 2014 SPIRIT Fashion Show was “Prima Facie,” Latin for “at a first glance,” and guided the show’s discussion of discrimination. As described in the program, “Image is powerful and complicated, and we want to show the community just how complicated it can actually be. Our show will demonstrate the power of someone’s first impression.” Indeed, the show’s four acts were divided into four sections, each dealing with a specific theme: “Sexuality” touched on the struggle for gay rights and acceptance, “Women” railed against unnatural standards of beauty and disregarding strong female behavior as “b****y”, “Black Men” dug deep into racial discrimination and violence, and “United States of America,” the first act of the show, served as an introduction to the evening by briefly mentioning all three aforementioned themes.
What sets the SPIRIT Fashion Show apart from other events, such as Lunar Gala, is the fact that its much more than simply a showcase of clothing. Throughout the night, there were numerous performances — spoken, sung, and danced — that made “Prima Facie” more of an artistic statement than a mere runway. Poems performed by junior acting major Mitchell Edwards (who also wrote a number of them himself), senior dramaturgy major Alesia Etinoff, and junior psychology major Nkem Chikwendu gave each section a narrative voice, with music and dance performances also serving to highlight the themes. Junior musical theatre major Jean Floradin’s defiant dance performance to Bon Iver’s “Lost in the Woods,” which provided the close to “Sexuality,” was especially powerful in its representation of the spirit of the night.
The fashions of “Prima Facie” kept in line with the sections in which they were placed. For example, “Human,” a collection by Sammi and Company that was included in the “Women” section, strives to “remind everyone that no matter who we are and what we wear, we should be treated and judged like humans, and not just as a trend.” Many of the collections showcased in “Black Men” were influenced by urban streetwear and, in keeping with the section’s character, some drew inspiration from figures who fought against repression. “Versus,” for example, included sweatshirts and T-shirts that bore the images of everyone from the Notorious B.I.G. to Malcolm X and Maya Angelou.
“Prima Facie” was a tremendous effort that transcended usual fashion show fare to become a statement on incredibly important issues of social justice and equality. Rather than celebrating perfection, “Prima Facie” chose to rail against it and celebrate beauty and triumph in its most true forms. And as an added bonus, the proceeds went to fund the Visionary Performing Arts Academy in downtown Pittsburgh.

Many School of Drama productions have somber themes and leave the audience pondering deep subjects, such as the meaning of time or humans’ relationship with mortality. Gutenberg! The Musical, however, was a breath of fresh air. The acting, as always, was wonderful, the sets were simplistic but representative of the tone of the production, the story was creative yet easy to understand, and the dialogue was absolutely hilarious.
The musical is about Doug Simon, played by junior musical theatre major Harron Atkins, and Bud Davenport, played by junior musical theatre major Erron Crawford, two young and energetic dreamers who have written a musical about the inventor of the printing press, Johann Gutenberg. Unfortunately, they did not realize that there is, ironically, very little historical information to be found about Gutenberg. So rather than choosing a new topic, they decide to write a historical fiction musical and make up the story of how Gutenberg invented the printing press.
Bud and Doug perform the play for the audience in hopes that there may be a Broadway producer in the audience who would like to help put the show on the big stage. However, since the ambitious writers are young and inexperienced, they do not have a cast or an orchestra, so they must play the role of every character. Both actors wore baseball hats with the name of their character written on the top so the audience could always tell who each actor was portraying. Sometimes they wore several hats at once and would take them off or put them back on to change characters. Another way they distinguished between characters was by using different accents. However, these accents didn’t always make explicit sense. For example, some characters had Cockney accents, some had American accents, some were just high-pitched, etc. In addition, Bud and Doug cannot afford fancy props or sets, so everyday items such as cardboard boxes, crates, bicycle pumps, and stuffed cats were used as props.
The limited set and the two-man show, along with senior biology and music performance double major Angela Lo accompanying on the piano, made for quite a spectacle and a really funny performance.
The story itself was just as humorous, filled with characters such as the overly malicious Monk who wants to stop Gutenberg from building a printing press out of a fear that the commoners might be able to read and interpret the Bible for themselves. The Monk has a stereotypical henchman at his side, and the two wreak havoc throughout the town. The Monk adds another source of humor, especially with lines like, “What a cute cat! I think I’ll name him Satan. I love Satan.” Another memorable character that adds humor to the story was Helvetica, Gutenberg’s young, beautiful, bodacious assistant who pines for him and despairs over unrequited love.
Between scenes, and in place of an intermission, Bud and Doug would break character to explain what was going on to the audience and give a quick preview of what was to come next. This served the purposes of allowing them to change scenes, keep the audience on the same page, and to add even more humor in the dialogue. Also, before the show started, Bud and Doug were seen setting up the stage and arguing about where to place a line of tape on the floor. At first, it was unclear if this conversation was part of the show or if it was real, but the audience laughed listening to the banter between the two characters.
Overall, this production was very enjoyable and definitely worth the free price of admission. In a particularly high-stress time of year with lots of projects and tests piling up, Gutenberg! The Musical provided a happy distraction. Laughter is definitely a great form of stress relief, and this production had the audience laughing from start to finish. The songs were surprisingly catchy, the acting spot-on, the story easy to follow and understand, and the characters engaging. This show proved that a huge cast, an elaborate set, and an orchestral score are not necessary for an entertaining show, and also spoke to the power of a strong story line.

If last Monday’s series finale of How I Met Your Mother proved anything, it was that the show should have ended a long time ago.
Had the beloved CBS sitcom been canceled after one, two, or even three seasons, perhaps then the ending would have made some semblance of sense. But HIMYM was no typical three-season flop. It was a sitcom unique in its innovative and playful relationship with style, its serialized and time-jumping format, and its fearlessness in tackling serious issues along with hijinks. Moreover, HIMYM was a series with nine seasons to its name that endured the marriages, pregnancies, and career fluctuations of its main cast, in addition to surviving a serious post-season seven dip in quality. Nine seasons of watching meant that HIMYM fans experienced nine seasons’ worth of plot advancement, character development, and emotional buildup. After all that, the HIMYM finale was nothing short of unacceptable. And it’s almost absurdly easy to pinpoint why.
For years, creators and head writers Carter Bays and Craig Thomas freely admitted that the finale was long-planned, the endgame set. There can be no better sign than these confident assurances that they had lost sight not only of fans’ expectations, but of what an organic and fulfilling end would entail. They failed to consider the nine years of writing that had occurred between their conception of the final scene and that scene’s unveiling. Bays and Thomas were too blinded by their idea of the perfect “full-circle” ending to realize when that ending was no longer applicable.
Almost nothing about the finale makes sense when placed in context with the rest of the show. For starters, season nine is set over the weekend of Barney and Robin’s wedding. An entire season is devoted to the marriage of a couple — considered for years to be HIMYM’s most popular — which the writers go on to destroy in less than ten minutes. Then, to add insult to injury, seasons of character development for Barney — tossed away along with his marriage — are reinstated with the lazy insert of sudden fatherhood. Lily, career forgotten, is reduced to a baby-making machine. Robin, career-consumed, closes off, abandoning the gang and the ex-husband who was once her best friend. Marshall is perhaps the only one who gets off unschated, and the finale tells us practically nothing about his future that we don’t already know.
Ted, however, receives the worst treatment of all. Good-guy Ted, eternal romantic Ted, finally meets his soulmate. The Mother — whose name is revealed to be Tracy — is quirky and smart and perfect for Ted in pretty much every conceivable way. They meet at a train station, and it’s the one truly beautiful moment amidst a sea of suck. In that moment, and during Ted’s closing speech about how he loved Tracy with all that he had for as long as they had, it is doubtful there was a dry eye in front of screens across America.
But then it got bad. Viewers had been speculating for months about the Mother’s death, so the confirmation was hardly shocking. However, only the wildest, densest speculators could have guessed at the stunt the writers pulled next. After years of on-again, off-again, not over it, over it, and a season spent making viewers fall in love with Tracy, it turns out that the Mother was just one final obstacle in the way of Ted and Robin.
The final scene — filmed in 2006, before the kids could get old — is jarring and irreverent. Ted’s tale of “How I Met Your Mother” is really just an elaborate ploy to convince his kids to give him the green light to chase Robin once again. “Seriously Dad,” the kids seem to whine, “stop blabbering on about our dead mother and go hook up with Aunt Robin already. We all know that’s what you really want.”
Is it, though? Is there a single fan who thought, after all this time, that Ted and Robin were genuinely meant to be together? That the Mother was just a gimmick, one more plot twist at the eleventh hour to make the final scene of the last episode echo the final scene of the first? Judging from the fan and critic outrage that has met the HIMYM finale, it’s hard to believe that anyone wanted this.
What message are we to take from HIMYM now? That no matter how long you wait, how much you try, and how deeply you love, friendships fade, loved ones die, and good things never last? If that’s the truth of living, no one is going to be watching what was meant to be a light-hearted sitcom to learn it.
Fans came to How I Met Your Mother and stuck with it for so long on the promise of a show celebrating friendship, love, and life. The finale felt like a grievous betrayal of that promise, and fans are left with a bitter taste in their mouths.

As the 100th annual Carnival arrives with a bang, many on campus are looking back into the history of the legendary event. The Spring Carnival Committee, headed by senior statistics major Emily Hrin and senior lighting design major Jackson Gallagher, in particular is bringing back an assortment of historical traditions from the early years of Carnival.
In researching the history of Carnival, which is recognized by most Carnegie Mellon students as the best weekend of the academic year, Gallagher became interested in the traditions of years past. The two that piqued his interest were plank jousting and the class chain tradition.
Plank Jousting
Plank jousting was a large part of Carnival from 1947 to the early 1980s. It involves laying a plank of wood across a pit of mud, and then having teams of about five people hit each other with pillows while balancing on the plank. The goal is to knock the opposing team into the mud below. According to Gallagher, the mud pit for the event will be created in the grassy area near the path by WQED off the Morewood parking lot. Teams can sign up to participate on the spot, with no preregistration needed, and hopefully for free, if feasible. If enough teams sign up for the event, the committee plans to have a tournament.
Class Chain
The second tradition that the Committee plans to revive is the class chain.
From the years 1914–1942, each class forged a link of a chain and then stamped it with their class year. When World War I started, however, the tradition was discontinued. This year, the chain will come out of the archives, where it has been stored for years, and, after nearly 70 years, be added to once again.
Not only will the class of 2014 be adding a link to the chain, but the Carnival Committee will also be sponsoring the forging of links for every missing class as well.
“Emily and I will be stamping our year into the chain,” Gallagher said. Alumni from every year have been invited back and will hopefully be available to stamp their year into the chain. Gallagher and Hrin hope that this tradition that will continue into future years as well.
“We’ve also arranged a ‘history of Carnival’ museum-type exhibit that will be open during UC operation hours containing memorabilia from Carnivals past,” said Hrin.
At the 100-year landmark, Carnival is thriving, and students should take this opportunity to revisit the history of the event while enjoying it for themselves.

Warning: This article contains spoilers for the first episode of season four of Game of Thrones.
The dragons are bigger, the stakes are higher, and the numbers become smaller with each episode. Season four of the wildly popular Game of Thrones premiered Sunday night, and with it came promise of a season full of twists, turns, and, of course, bloodshed.
Based on the book series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin, the hit HBO show is set in the fictional continents of Westoros and Essos as their inhabitants fight for control of the Iron Throne.
But the road to power and glory is lined with the lives of those who were unsuccessful, because when you play the game of thrones, you either win or you die.
This was a lesson learned the hard way by Robb Stark (Richard Madden), his mother Catelyn (Michelle Fairley), and his wife Talisa (Oona Chaplin) in one of the show’s most gruesome scenes from last season, dubbed “The Red Wedding.”
Last season’s finale “Mhysa” saw the fallout from the tragedy and brought many of the storylines if not to a close, then to a nice pause.
This week’s episode, “Two Swords” picks up as King’s Landing is preparing for the wedding between King Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) and Margaery Tyrell (Natalie Dormer).
Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) has his hands full dealing with the arrival of the Dornish Prince, but not the one they are expecting. Prince Oberyn (Pedro Pascal) is there to exact revenge against the Lannisters for the death of his sister.
Tyrion’s wife, Sansa (Sophie Turner) is understandably struggling after the murder of her brother and mother. In a particularly touching scene, Tyrion plays the good husband and tries to convince her to carry on for the sake of her mother, but to no avail.
Her bastard brother Jon Snow (Kit Harington) doesn’t have much time to mourn his late half-brother before he is put before a council of the Night’s Watch to answer for his transgressions last season.
He’s admitted to his time with the Wildlings, especially Ygritte (Rose Leslie), but is upset that his brothers don’t seem to believe his warnings of an oncoming war from beyond the Wall.
The despicable King Joffrey proved once again that he’s more interested in looking like a king than actually acting like one, by ignoring his duties and, instead, tormenting his uncle Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldeu).
Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), Mother of Dragons, Khaleesi, and one of the most impressive characters on the show, continues her mission of amassing an army large enough to invade Westoros and take back the kingdom she believes is right fully hers.
In the meantime, she is beginning to discover that even the most devoted mothers cannot always tame their children — be they dragons or men.
As can only be expected, it was an episode for the viewer to play catch-up, focusing more on laying the groundwork for the major storylines this season. Although lacking in any major excitement, the Game of Thrones season four premiere was the perfect episode after a long break

Dear Matt & Ryan,
Carnival! Carnival! Carnival! It’s here! I thought I’d be moving on my sorority’s booth in the rain on Friday, but I didn’t! Instead I’m just slaved to building the damn thing for the next 72 hours, which is oh so wonderful. I can’t wait to watch all the happy children climb around this carefully constructed junge gym of fun! Carnival! I’m so happy! Sunshine! Rainbows! Kittens!
Sincerely,
Unbelievably Naive Into Carnival, Operating Really No Sleep
Dear UNICORNS,
It is wonderful that you are so excited about Carnival, we too have been checking isitcarnivalyet.com constantly for the last two weeks. Which is probably the reason that we both got zeros on our midterms, but that doesn’t matter! Spring has come again. We will get to eat artery-clogging state-fair food in the Morewood parking lot! Both of us have been looking forward to our last Carnival here at Carnegie Mellon, and are kinda glad that we don’t have to see Carnival moved next to the CFA parking lot.
Seriously, a Ferris-wheel view of the University Center isn’t as cool as one of Gates.
Ryan & Matt
Dear Ryan & Matt,
I’m really surprised that although both of you are seniors, and have plans for after graduation, you are still as invested in everything as you’ve ever been! What is your secret? I’m dying to know so that I can be as good a senior as you two next year.
Sincerely, **
**Nebby, Attached, Student Activity Leader
Dear NASAL,
To answer your question, the reason that we are as good of seniors as we were sophomores and juniors is that we both really want to graduate, and get out of here. Don’t get us wrong, Carnegie Mellon has been a great place to get an education, but we are ready to do something else with our lives. Matt got that scuba-diving job, and Ryan is eloping with his roommate’s girlfriend. As such, we both have caught a case of senioritis ahead of our last Carnival as students, and have decided to enjoy April in Pittsburgh. This is our last advice column. We are sorry to no longer be able to offer sage advice to all you awkward members of the Tartan audience, but all good things must come to an end.
We’ll always live on in your memories, however terrible our puns were. 
With love,
Matt & Ryan

Frozen
Friday, April 11 — 9
Sunday, April 13 — 2:30, 5, 8
If you’re one of the three people who doesn’t know the lyrics to “Let It Go,” it might be time to check out Frozen, the latest Disney animated feature film that’s been taking over the world by winter storm. Elsa (Idina Menzel), princess of Arendelle, has the magical ability to create ice and snow. While it seems like a dream come true, Elsa resents herself because of the harm she bears to her younger sister, Anna (Kristin Bell). Due to Elsa’s fear, she decides to isolate herself from Anna, causing a rift to grow between the two sisters. But when the entire kingdom gets cast under Elsa’s ice spell, Anna teams up with mountain man Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), his reindeer Sven, and the magical snowman, Olaf (Josh Gad), to find her sister. In one of the most splendid films of the year, Frozen has you singing to the top of your lungs and bawling your eyes out at the same time.
Sharknado
Friday, April 11 — 12
Saturday, April 12 — 12
The movie we’ve all been waiting for is finally here and we are all alive to be a part of this momentous event. Sharknado takes adventure to an entirely new world and it’s too good to be true. After a freak hurricane hits Los Angeles, man-eating sharks start attacking the city literally by storm. In a desperate attempt to save his wife, bar-owner Fin (Ian Ziering) gathers together his group of friends to face an impending tornado — of sharks. In what is definitely on of the most unexpected movies of all time, Sharknado manages to toss criticisms aside by making fun of itself within its own movie. It’s amazingly fun and fearlessly imaginative and, if you miss it, you might regret not being able to tell your grandchildren how awesome it was to be alive during the generation of Sharknado.

I am so underwhelmed and unsurprised by the choice to have Mac Miller and Icona Pop play at Carnival this year, I can barely get riled up enough to share my opinion.
But this is music, and the Tartan is giving me my very own soapbox, so, why don’t I?
I don’t know a lot about Mac Miller, I admit. All I know is that he is a rapper, and he is from Pittsburgh. That’s it. I know someone who saw him in Squirrel Hill once, and everyone was very excited about it.
Despite my limited knowledge of Mac Miller, I do at least know everything there is to know about Icona Pop: that one song from Girls. Seriously, I’ll go see Icona Pop just to watch the change in the crowd from bored and uninterested to foamy­-mouthed fans when they play that one song.
I can think of a ton of artists I would have been jazzed to see at Carnival. First of all, Danny Brown would have been killer. I know we like to pick rappers for this, so lets get an awesome one, right? Old was such a good album, and I think it came out recently enough to be relevant. Plus he has a song featuring Charli XCX as well, so people wouldn’t miss that Icona Pop song too much.
But if we wanted to break the monotony of rap, I’d be down to see Empire of the Sun as well. They’re a crowd­pleaser, like MGMT, except they never released an album as personally disappointing as Congratulations was. Plus, they have this crazy glam­rock, king­-of-­Neptune thing going on. I bet it would be fun as hell to watch.
I’m not pleased with the concert choice, but that’s okay. That’s not really all that Carnival is about. It’s about people waking up way too early for Buggy, and professors canceling class on Wednesday because “none of you would come anyway.” It’s about not having to do homework! And, in my case, it’s about escaping briefly to Morgantown to see Tobaxxo and The Hood Internet, which is going to be gnarly, in the best sense of the word.

When Carnegie Mellon released its Fall 2014 course listings last Sunday, some Carnegie Mellon students noticed that something was missing — 70-419 Entrepreneurship Practicum: Apprentice, a course taught by Robert F. Culbertson, adjunct assistant professor of entrepreneurship in the Tepper School of Business.
Culbertson’s course was an outlier in Tepper’s entrepreneurship offerings, and gave students hands-on lessons in entrepreneurship. According to Michael McDermott, a junior materials science and engineering and biomedical engineering double major and a teaching assistant for the course, the course was broken down into four to five apprenticeships, which are different projects, usually in groups and ranging from two weeks to a month long, that students complete.
The first one, McDermott said, was always karaoke. Students had to break into groups and sing in front of the class, “because most of us have terrible voices, and just look and sound terrible in front of the class when we’re doing it,” McDermott said. “That primes you to work with other people and be comfortable with being uncomfortable.”
After that, McDermott said, the course focused on selling products and getting funding from venture capitalists. 
For the final apprenticeship, Culbertson gave each group of students a seed fund and asked them simply to make as much money as possible, which, McDermott said, “is the heart of entrepreneurship.”
McDermott is also author of a change.org petition to “Save RF Culbertson and 70-419,” which currently has 579 signatures. According to the petition, “By signing this petition, we as students stand together to save one of the most influential classes taught here at Carnegie Mellon, and to save the man who has given so much to this school and its students.”
McDermott has reached out to the administration of the Tepper School of Business, focusing on how the loss of Culbertson’s course affects not only current students but future students, as well as alumni relations.
“We just want to highlight — whether the course gets reinstated or not — the customer at CMU; if we talk in terms of sales, the customer is a student. And so if you’re [angering] your customer, how is that going to translate into money from donations in the future?” McDermott said. “As a student, I don’t want CMU to have a lower endowment because they [angered] alumni in their thirties who love [Culbertson], who this guy has done everything for.”
“I’m in engineering; I’m not really behind the business program,” McDermott said. “I took the course because I thought it would be interesting, and it changed my life. And I want that to continue for future students.”
According to a news release from the Tepper School of Business, “We appreciate the sentiment expressed by members of the campus community via social media, as through other communication channels, and will thoughtfully consider the perspectives that are expressed. However, the school will not publicly discuss specific details relating to our curriculum decisions.”
Michael Trick, senior associate dean of education for the Tepper School of Business, said that Tepper, and Carnegie Mellon as a whole, is in the midst of reforming its entrepreneurship offerings. “This has been a great time for entrepreneurship at the school. We have a track for it in the business school; we have a new minor out of economics called economics, entrepreneurship, and innovation,” Trick said. “As a minor, in the Tepper school, you can pick up entrepreneurship courses. There’s a good number of ways to get entrepreneurship courses.”
While Trick did not comment on why Culbertson’s course was removed from Carnegie Mellon’s Fall 2014 course offerings, he said that it was important to have actual entrepreneurs teaching entrepreneurship to students. “When you think of entrepreneurship training, the concept of mentoring, the concept of getting real entrepreneurship teaching the students, is an incredibly important one,” Trick said. “We’ve had more adjuncts hired in the last three years than in any time. So, while we use tenure-track faculty and teaching-track faculty, we also use entrepreneurs, and they are fantastic.”
Culbertson is a well-known entrepreneur outside of Carnegie Mellon; according to McDermott, he began at a young age as an entrepreneur by starting his own taxi and limousine service, and from there has been “buying and selling companies and starting and selling companies for 25 or 30 years.”
Culbertson is currently the chief executive officer of Eidoserve, Inc., a privately held company that, according to Bloomberg BusinessWeek, “develops interactive voice response (IVR) solutions with integrated mobile, Web, and avatar dialogue platforms for customers in the United States.” In March 2010, Culbertson gave a talk called “Getting Rich and Staying There” as part of TEDxCMU.
In an email sent to Culbertson early Saturday morning, Trick wrote, “After consulting with the entrepreneurship faculty, I have decided that we will no longer be offering your Apprenticeship course. As part of our revamping of the curriculum, I need to rationalize our entrepreneurship offerings. This involves providing a clear sequence of courses, with one ‘gateway’ course leading on to more advanced offerings, increasingly offered by tenure-track faculty. The Apprenticeship course does not fit in this sequence.”
In the current entrepreneurship sequence, students start with one of several introductory entrepreneurship courses, such as 70-415: Introduction to Entrepreneurship, before moving on to more advanced electives. Culbertson’s course, Trick said, was free-standing, and did not act as a prerequisite for any other entrepreneurship course offerings.
Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno, who works to facilitate discussions between students and faculty about matters such as this one, echoed Tricks’ sentiments about Carnegie Mellon’s entrepreneurship offerings.
According to Casalaegno, “[Carnegie Mellon] is looking at its entrepreneurship options for both the Tepper curriculum and for all of campus, and has been really well articulated, I think, in having the move to the Tepper Quad being a hub for all disciplines to collaborate and to really enhance the thrust of entrepreneurship as a coalescing theme for students in all programs.”
When Casalegno heard over the weekend from students and alumni after it was announced that 70-419 would not be offered, she contacted Trick and Dean of the Tepper School of Business Robert M. Dammon and “let them know I was hearing from students, and that I wanted to know how [Trick] would like me to encourage their direct engagement with him. He responded immediately and said ‘please have them get in touch with me and the dean so that we can hear feedback and consider all of it.’ ”
Trick similarly said that, although he welcomes the input from students, it is unlikely the course will be reinstated. “In everything we do, we welcome the input, even if it’s telling me I’m an idiot, because it tells me about the student experience, what the students find valuable,” Trick said. “And that’s important to me. I cannot crowd source running this business school, but what I need is that input. And I am not shying away from any input on any other decisions I am making.”
Zaneta Grant, a junior economics and professional writing double major who is currently taking 70-419, said that Culbertson’s course will be sorely missed. “It’s my favorite class I’ve taken since coming to CMU, ... this has been my favorite class to date because it encourages me to think outside the box,” Grant said.

Student government election results were released on Monday, March 31. Junior electrical and computer engineering and business administration double major Ian Glasner was elected student body president (SBP) and junior biological sciences major Shalini Ray was elected student body vice president (SBVP). 
Additionally, the student body voted sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Divya Kothandapani as student body vice president for finance (SBVPF) and sophomore computer science and math double major Jack Michalak as student body vice president for organizations (SBVPO).
Student voter turnout showed a slight increase over previous years, with 17.9 percent of total students voting. 32.21 percent of undergraduate students cast their votes, as compared to 30 percent in 2013. Graduate student voting decreased, however, with only 3.32 percent of Carnegie Mellon’s graduate population voting, a small drop from the 3.94 percent who voted in 2013.
Glasner and Ray ran their SBP/SBVP ticket on a platform of getting students more involved in their representation, promising to push for a number of reforms including restructuring dining plans to be more desirable to upperclassmen and changing the school’s dorm alcohol policy to one which uses an internal system rather than one which involves the police, similar to the system currently in place at all eight Ivy League universities.
While not designating one policy as a top priority, Glasner said, “I’m very passionate about dining, and I’m also passionate about looking into the current alcohol policy on campus.”
“I think every change that I want to happen is going to be a year’s process, if not more,” Glasner continued. “So, getting them all started at the beginning of the year is going to mean weekly meetings with administration, bringing students on board, and getting student feedback.”
Kothandapani campaigned on her experience serving on the university’s Joint Funding Committee (JFC) and promised to provide an easier-to-understand budget process for student organizations.
Kothandapani said that “starting the application for next year’s JFC reps” would be her first task when taking office, and spoke about the number of votes she received, saying “it feels really good to have that support.”
Michalak built his campaign around a set of reforms beginning with the organization recognition process, setting up a better system for student organizations to receive advice, and creating  an improved system for room registration. Michalak also spoke of supporting broader campus reforms, such as expanding the Amnesty International policy for alcohol to include drugs, and the prospect of establishing gender-neutral restrooms.
Michalak recalled the wishes of current SBVPO Corrine Rockoff. “She really wanted someone with the experience to take over the position,” Michalak said. “I wanted to be able to make sure somebody with the experience relevant to the position got it, and the best way to do that was to run.”
“A lot of people see the organizations of Carnegie Mellon as the bread and butter of the university,” Michalak said, stating that he wished to immediately focus on improving the organization recognition process and encourage graduate student participation and representation in student organizations.
Ray spoke of her joint candidacy with Glasner, saying, “It ended up being the perfect relationship, because we weren’t best buddies before we came in, so we had that sense of respect for each other. But now we get along so well; we will crack jokes with each other all the time.” She added, “It’s great. I honestly love working with him.”
“From what I’ve seen so far, we work very well together,” Glasner agreed. 
“There hasn’t been too much experience on the working relationship between the two of us because the work’s just getting started.”
Ray encouraged students, saying, “don’t be hesitant to approach us with anything. We have enough experience to make things work.”
Glasner stated that he was honored to have been elected as SBP and said, “I really want to help improve the student experience at Carnegie Mellon, and if anyone has good ideas, I absolutely want them to share them with me. I look forward to a productive year.”

He lived in Egypt for eight years — three as a correspondent for the Los Angeles Times and five for The New York Times — and returned to the region to witness the dramatic conflict in the Middle East during the Arab Spring.
Speaking before a half-filled auditorium in Porter Hall, now Deputy Foreign Editor for The New York Times Michael Slackman visited Carnegie Mellon on Tuesday to discuss the United States’s role abroad, particularly in the Middle East. The discussion was presented by The New York Times, Undergraduate Student Senate, and the Collegiate Readership Program.
During his discussion, Slackman stressed the importance of the citizen’s responsibility to be informed. “Just read about the world about you,” he said. It’s what everyone in the world is fighting for right now — the people in Ukraine, the people in Egypt — you have the right to have that information.”
Slackman told the story of the day he was fired at in the island country of Bahrain in February 2011. Slackman was dispatched to Bahrain when a community of Shiite Muslims demanded rights from the ruling Sunni Muslim family during a series of peaceful protests. “Members of the Shiite community were coming out by the tens of thousands — hundreds of thousands — and they were determined to push for their rights,” Slackman said during an interview with The Tartan.
One day, abut a thousand young protesters marched to Pearl Square in Manama, Bahrain’s capital.
They were fired upon by the police. Slackman and his colleagues ran from the conflict, but were fired upon too. “A helicopter ... flew overhead, and I thought we were being shot at by the helicopter,” Slackman said. 
He ran into an alley with a colleague and saw the helicopter follow. “And that was when I was like ... they’re hunting us.” A car drove by and Slackman screamed at it before the driver took him away from the area.
Slackman told the audience, “What foreign correspondents do is they bear witness.” He said correspondents witness events so that people have access to information about the world around them — so that they can be responsibly informed citizens.
“Being a reporter is one of the most thrilling and rewarding jobs you can have,” Slackman said to The Tartan. “It allows you to experience life through someone else’s eyes ... to give voice to the downtrodden and the oppressed.”
Slackman then turned the discussion to the United States’s involvement in the Middle East, as well as Crimea. He questioned, “How much of an actor should the United States be in other nations’ revolutions?”
Slackman compared President Barack Obama’s current foreign affairs footprint to former President George W. Bush’s footprint. President Obama’s footprint is much smaller than Bush’s footprint was, Slackman said. He explained that Bush’s term ended after two wars and two occupations and resulted in resentment from several parts of the world. 
Meanwhile, President Obama promoted foreign policy through an aggressive diplomatic core, Slackman said. While Bush turned to his defense secretary for matters of foreign policy, President Obama turned to his treasury secretary to promote sanctions. “It seemed to be working fairly well until now,” he said. “Right about now everybody’s asking, ‘Has the lighter footprint run out of gas? Is the world coming apart and moving backward again because the United States is taking a different approach?’ ”
“What’s playing out is very mobile and it is kind of immune to the influence from abroad,” he answered, noting that it is misguided to ask what America and other outsiders should or shouldn’t be doing in the Middle East: “What’s happening now is a search for identity.” 
He said that the United States and Western Europe have trouble accepting the search for identity by countries in the Middle East while they stand by. “But that’s not to say that there’s no role for the international community in the Middle East,” Slackman said. “And if there’s one thing that I’d like you guys to take away tonight, I want you to think about Syria.”
Syria is a country of 23 million people, over half of which are displaced. Slackman said that people in Syria are caught between a brutal dictatorship and foreign powers, but the United States has not become heavily involved. He stated that maybe the United States shouldn’t have applied the lessons it learned from Iraq to Syria. “The humanitarian crisis that we’re experiencing in Syria is unprecedented in my life,” he said. “It breaks my heart when I think about what’s happening in Syria.”
Slackman ended his talk with the assertion that the Obama administration has not articulated it’s foreign policy well, but that if a democratic nation like the United States is not going to get involved in a foreign affair like the situation in Syria, the nation has to explain why. Slackman then opened the floor for discussion.
Business Affairs Committee Chair for Student Senate and newly elected Student Body Vice President for Finance Divya Kothandapani said about Slackman, “I thought it was important that someone [in media] come and explain how media works — how newspapers, editors, and writers — what they think, their thought process, and giving a different perspective.”
As Business Affairs Committee Chair, Kothandapani, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major, oversees the Collegiate Readership Program and works with The New York Times through this program. 
The program is responsible for providing newspapers across campus in various campus buildings and dorms, including the University Center and Resnik House. 
Students pay a five dollar media fee each academic year for the papers, which are otherwise free throughout the year.

Students, faculty and staff jostled to get into Rashid Auditorium to hear a talk by Sal Khan, founder of Khan Academy, Thursday morning. Ten minutes before the speech was scheduled to begin, the 250-seat auditorium was standing room only — it was so crowded that the University Police closed the doors, barring additional spectators to prevent a fire hazard.
Determined to see Khan, many students looked in through the window instead, like Robert Buarque de Macedo, a sophomore physics major, who said that seeing Khan was amazing after hearing his voice so often in Khan Academy videos. “Khan helped me through high school,” Macedo said, although he had never met Khan nor seen him in person before. Aatish Nayak, a first-year electrical and computer engineering major, added, “It’s crazy that [Khan] makes his own videos; it shows his dedication.”
Khan’s videos, which now form the basis of the website Khan Academy, have become enormously popular, with more than 10 million students viewing them each month.
Khan is, in many ways, an accidental educator. While working for a hedge fund, his family was visiting and he learned that his cousin Nadia was struggling in math. “I told her, ‘Look, I think you’re fully capable of this … if you’re willing to … we’ll work on the phone everyday,’ ” Khan said. Starting in August 2004, Khan worked with her on her math skills while he lived in Boston and she lived in New Orleans.
Khan’s belief that everyone can succeed if given the right education drives much of his work.
Nadia rapidly progressed in her school from “slow” math to an advanced track — her success inspired other family members to ask Khan for tutoring help. Khan, who has a background in software, started writing quizzes for his students to take and was mentoring as many as 10 family members at once. A friend recommended to Khan that he prerecord his lessons and load them onto YouTube so he could scale to more students.
Khan was apprehensive at first, saying, “That’s a horrible idea. YouTube is for cats playing the piano.” But after a month of using the YouTube videos, his cousins told him that they preferred the videos over the video chats.
“It soon became clear that people who were not my cousins were watching the videos. Most of the comments were just ‘Thank you’ which is a pretty big deal. I don’t know how many of you watch YouTube, but most of the comments are not ‘Thank you,’ ” Khan said. “Then [the comments] got more intense, like ‘this is the reason I passed algebra,’ ‘this is the reason I decided to major in engineering.’ ”
Khan’s success on YouTube kick-started his career as one of the most well-known online educators in the U.S.
Khan’s mission is “to provide a free world-class education for anyone, anywhere.”
“Education has always been the key determinant between the haves and have nots, but it has always been scarce and it has always been expensive,” Khan said. 
Khan sees online education as a “once in a millennium” chance to change education’s inaccessibility by giving his content away for free.
Khan was in Pittsburgh to receive the 19th annual Heinz Award for his advancement of the human condition. 
His speech at Carnegie Mellon is part of the Distinguished Lecture Series for President Subra Suresh’s newly launched Simon Initiative, which will explore technology-enhanced education such as the Khan Academy.
Khan closed his talk with an anecdote to illustrate the potential he sees for more widespread education delivered with novel technology to transform our society.
“If you were to go back 400 years to Western Europe, you had a 15–20 percent literacy rate,” Khan said. “If you asked a clergy member, ‘What percentage of the population is capable of reading,’ they might have said … ‘40 or 50 percent are even capable of reading.’ We now know that’s widely pessimistic; the answer is pretty close to 100 percent.”
The historical example was meant to show how easy it is to doubt students. Khan ended his lecture by challenging the audience.
“What similar blinders do we have on today? If we ask ourselves what percentage of people are capable of understanding quantum physics, you might say maybe one percent, maybe five percent ... what percentage of people are capable of contributing to genomics research? Maybe ten percent, maybe 15 percent ... But what if over the next 10 or 20 years, … that gets closer to 100 percent? ... [What] if education becomes a basic human right?”
“I think that will be a very exciting time to live,” Khan concluded.

Underage Drinking 
March 29, 2014
A University Police officer on patrol saw a visibly intoxicated male at the intersection of Forbes and Morewood Avenues. After stopping to check on the individual, the officer confirmed that he was under 21. The man, who was not a Carnegie Mellon affiliate, was cited for underage drinking and given further medical assistance.
Underage Drinking and False ID Card
March 29, 2014
University Police cited a Carnegie Mellon student who was visibly intoxicated in front of Hamburg Hall. At the time, the student presented the officer with a false ID card, and was later confirmed to be under the legal drinking age. The student was cited for two offenses — underage drinking and carrying a false ID — and was given medical aid.
Underage Drinking
March 30, 2014
A Carnegie Mellon student was cited after she passed out in the television lounge of Hamerschlag House. A security officer checking the area noticed the unconscious student and checked on her. University Police later confirmed that she was under the legal drinking age, and transported the female to the hospital for further treatment after citing her for underage drinking.
University Police also cited a Carnegie Mellon student who had passed out while eating at Skibo Cafe. A passer-by who noticed the student called University Police, who found the student slumped over with his face resting on a plate of food. The male was identified and cited for underage drinking, and after being tended to by CMU EMS, was released in the care of a sober friend.
Suspicious Activity 
April 1, 2014
University Police responded to Mudge House after a student reported to University Police that at 8:55 p.m. he was walking on Morewood Avenue near Stever House when a gray or brown Cadillac pulled up next to him. According to the student, a black male in his mid-thirties or early forties rolled down the window and reached for the glove compartment, while the vehicle was at a complete stop. The student, who was afraid of being robbed, ran away and could not confirm the driver’s intention.
Underage Drinking
April 2, 2014
University Police responded to McGill House after a community adviser contacted them after hearing a party in the dormitory that might involve underage drinking. When the police arrived, they confiscated all alcohol and cited five individuals for underage drinking.

Committee Reports 
The Campus Life Committee discussed their upcoming annual effort to distribute Krispy Kreme doughnuts and coffee during Move On in the Morewood Parking Lot on Friday between 9 p.m. and midnight. The Internal Development Committee reminded Senators to come to the Alumni Brunch that will be held during Spring Carnival from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. on Saturday in Donner House.
Finance Allocation 
Senate allocated $4,500 to the Mindfulness Room. Student Body President and senior biological sciences major Lindsay MacGillivray presented in front of Senate and described the purpose of the money. When the Mindfulness Room was constructed, money from several sources was used to refit what was then the West Wing TV Lounge and buy equipment — like yoga mats and plant walls — for the room. The motion was unanimously passed.
Points of Discussion 
First-year artchitecture major Victoria Yong was approved as a new member at large. Class council and a potential budget outline were also discussed. 
Senate also discussed purchasing food for meetings. Typically, Senate provides food at 4:30 p.m., half an hour before General Body Meeting starts. 
Often, there is no food left by the time the meeting begins at 5 p.m. Members agreed that Senate should order more food, so that those who arrive at 5 p.m. are still able to eat.
Announcements 
Senate thanked those who helped out with The New York Times lecture event and who  helped with public relations for the Sal Khan lecture. Senate also congratulated electrical and computer engineering and business administration double major Ian Glasner and biological sciences major Shalini Ray on their elections to student body president and student body vice president, respectively. Civil and environmental engineering and engineering and public policy double major Colin Chadderton and senior biological sciences major Lindsay MacGillivray reminded Senate that the last installment of the “First Lectures” series will take place on April 17.

The New York Times Deputy Foreign Editor Michael Slackman visited Carnegie Mellon on Tuesday for a talk presented by The New York Times, Undergraduate Student Senate, and the Collegiate Readership Program. Slackman sat down with The Tartan to talk about his time in the Middle East and his life as a reporter and editor. The following transcript is an abridged version of the interview, with some questions and answers removed.
The Tartan: Your talk is about U.S. relations abroad in relation to the Arab Spring. How did those events initially affect relations and how are they still affecting relations?
Michael Slackman: The Arab Spring did two things to America's role in the Middle East. The first thing that it did is, it upended the paradigm of power that previously existed and that we relied on to pursue our agenda in the Middle East and to preserve the status quo. What I mean by that is — well there was Israel — but in the Arab world, we primarily relied on this loose axis of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan to preserve the peace with Israel and contain Iran. With the Arab Spring and all the tumult that has occurred in Egypt, that has fundamentally — we've basically lost Egypt as a vehicle for trying to pursue our interests in the Middle East, but because of the way we've behaved in Egypt, first supporting the ouster Mubarak, and then not supporting the military takeover, the Saudis are very angry at us. So they are pursuing what they see as their own interests in the region, sometimes contradictory to ours. 
So I think it's really shaken up the way in which we are able to engage in the Middle East because that power paradigm has changed. But the other thing is — the reality is — the Middle East, these countries, are going through a real identity crisis. It's very internal, whether it's in Egypt, Tunisia, or Syria. They're trying to figure out who they are and how they relate to each other, what it means to be a citizen, what the relationship between religion and society is, what the relationship between military and society is, so to that extent, there's almost nothing we can do. We just have to kind of sit back and let events play out on the ground as these countries try to figure out who they are and where they're going. 
TT: When you were abroad in Egypt, when the Arab Spring — the first events were occurring — were there noticeable changes that you saw?
MS: The biggest change — I lived in Egypt for eight years, not consecutively three for [the Los Angeles Times] and five for The New York Times — and the entire time I was there, the street was a non-factor. The population was largely depoliticized. It was too costly for the Egyptian public to get involved in politics. For a long time, there was a compact between Mubarak and citizens that basically said 'You can live your lives, we'll guarantee a level of livelihood, but keep out of politics.' As the population got bigger, as the economy stalled, the government was no longer able to keep up its end. The entire structure of the state really was failing in its ability to do what you expect a state to do from pick up the trash to provide security to put out a fire if there's a fire, to provide access to basic healthcare and education. It couldn't do that anymore and the demands of the people and the anger of the people kept growing. With the Arab Spring, the street — for the first time in my lifetime — became a real force in Arab politics, and it continues to be to this day. Leaders can no longer dictate from the top down. They need the consent of the masses because people have seen the power of protest.
TT: How did your experience abroad differ from what we saw here? How did it compare?
MS: I didn't live in Egypt when the Arab Spring happened. I had already moved to Germany a year earlier, and I went back as it was unfolding — spent some time in Egypt, a lot of time in Bahrain, I was in Morocco, and Jordan during that period. I don't know what you saw here, but in those places there was absolutely a sense of — and I suspect this came across here — there was a sense of possibility. One of the tragedies of 30 years and — depending on the country — decades of dictatorship was the concept of hope was gone. People had no hope or very little hope — many people, not everybody, I'm generalizing — for improving your station in life, that your kids would do better than you, that you could be who you want to be. That hope had kind of disappeared. It wasn't there. There was no sense of self determination and suddenly you had people saying 'We can make a difference in our own lives,' and that was tremendous. It was very powerful.
TT: Were there tangible things that you noticed when you went back to the Middle East that showed that hope?
MS: Yeah, there were, all over the place. There were community groups organizing. When there was an election, people would wait on line in the blazing sun for hours to be able to cast a ballot. It was civic life and civic participation growing in ways that had never happened before in Egypt that I had never seen. Later — see the thing is, it's very easy to know what you want to tear down; it's hard to know what you want to build. And in any society that's divided, when people come together against something, the minute that thing is gone, they have decide collectively what they want to build or it becomes a little bit 'every man for himself.' In the post-Mubarak period, when the military was still running Egypt, life got difficult, the traffic got worse, prices went up, foreign-directed investment tapered off, the economy was tanking, people started to get desperate. And then I went back a year into it and people were starting to get tired. They were still hopeful, but they were worried about the economy. At the end of the day, if you can't feed your family, that's really what matters and there was a level of desperation rising.
TT: There was a really striking video of you being shot at from the helicopter in Bahrain. Could you talk about that experience a little bit more?
MS: I couldn't believe they were shooting at me. I had got to Bahrain — I was only supposed to be there for two days — and I had arranged to spend time with a young man who had trained in human rights work. Before you knew it, we were in the middle of a huge popular uprising. Members of the Shiite community were coming out by the tens of thousands — hundreds of thousands — and they were determined to push for their rights. They thought that they had been discriminated against in education, employment, in everything, by the Sunni leadership that was the minority. I was there for a week, and there were highs and lows and there were protests and the police shot people and teargassed people and we witnessed all kinds of events that left people dead. Throughout this, I would go to funerals, so the morning was protests and the evening was funerals. 
One of the last days that I was going to be there, there was a funeral, and when the funeral was over, everybody — for a kid who was shot at by the police, a young man — they buried the kid, and a group of protesters started leading the crowd toward the hospital — a couple thousand young people marching up toward the hospital. And I'm standing to the side with my colleague Nadim Audi, and we're walking up toward the hospital, and the road splits, and to the left was Pearl Square and to the right was the hospital. I'll never forget this — Nadim leaned over and went 'Uh oh, this is not going to be good,' because the army had surrounded Pearl Square and decided they would not allow people to gather. Protest movements can't really congeal if there's no public space for people to gather. Tahrir Square — Egypt happened partly because Tahrir Square exists as a physical space. The rulers of these monarchies throughout the Persian Gulf have built cities where there's no public space — people don't interact — except the mall. So they surrounded this space and as the kids — these were kids, just marching, clapping their hands over their heads — and we're standing off to the side and we're walking up and the army just opened fire. They just opened fire, and I ran [one] way, Nadim ran straight back, and the kids ... got shot. 
Later, I looked at the video — I never realized I jumped over a wall, but there's a wall there that I apparently jumped over with the videographer, and we stopped a good distance away — you can see in the video we're pretty far away — and I'm talking about it, and this helicopter flies over us and they open fire. I was nowhere near the group that had been protesting. We were way off on the side, and the bullets — you've seen in the movie when they puff in the sand — that's what it was like. We ran — Patrick and I, poor Patrick, he was a newlywed and he'd never been to a conflict zone before — we ran down this alley, and I leaned up against a retaining wall, and the helicopter followed us. This is the only time I ever got scared. At that moment — like when we were being shot at it, it was so stunning that they would — the first time, they shot at the crowd and we happened to be there. The second time, they targeted us, absolutely, but then they followed us and I'll never forget looking up at the bottom of that helicopter thinking ... 'They're hunting us' and at that moment a car drove by and I screamed and the guy opened the back door and we jumped in and we drove away. And the Qatari government has denied ever since then that they shot at us from the helicopter. Maybe they didn't. Maybe they shot at us from the buildings, but they targeted us — they shot at us.
TT: You were a reporter before and are now an editor. What's the most rewarding part about your job now, and what's one thing that you miss most about being in the field?
MS: I like learning new things and the thing is, every step of the way of my career as a reporter, I learned something new and every job prepared me for the next job. I was a local reporter, I was a government reporter, I was a county reporter, an investigative reporter, a state government reporter, and then I became a foreign correspondent. And being a foreign correspondent is a whole different set of skills. It involves everything from understanding how to get places — logistics is 80 percent of it ... And then after a while, you develop those skills, and I remember I got to Warsaw — one of my last [foreign] assignments, and I thought 'This is kind of cool, but I've done this' ... And then around that time, they offered me the job as deputy foreign editor, and I went back and I've just learned so much. 
Being a reporter is one of the most thrilling and rewarding jobs you can have. It allows you to experience life through someone else's eyes and in someone else's shoes — to ask people things you couldn't even ask your own family, and they want to share with you, they want to tell you — to give voice to the downtrodden and the oppressed — absolutely, it's awesome — but it's very linear, so it's you doing your story. You get your assignment, you figure out how to report it, you collect the material, you conceptualize, synthesize, write, edit, it goes in the paper. 
As an editor, I have to have a much broader view and I have to think in 360 degrees all the time. I can't just think about Egypt and the Middle East. I have to think about what's going on in Latin America — why is Brazil suddenly exploding in protest and what does that social movement mean? I have to understand how the whole area of North Africa has become kind of a free zone for Jihadis and Islamic radicals and what impact the French are having on that area. I have to understand Europe, which in many ways can be very boring, but it's also fascinating as the continent tries to hold onto what it stands for but reinvent itself. How it deals with immigration, how it deals with the rise of Islam. It's fascinating and it's challenging because I have to do it all simultaneously, so it's just different ... Opportunity at my age to do something completely new and learn something new is cool.
TT: Is there anything that we haven't talked about that you would want the student body to hear?
MS: Don't let anyone ever tell you what you can and can't do. Follow your heart and just, honestly — I had an editor early in my career who pulled me aside and said 'You're not very good, you can't write, and maybe you want to think about doing something else with your life.' And I just thought she was [rude], to be honest with you. But at the same time, I took her criticism to heart and worked at it. Part of it is luck. Part of it is opportunity, but it seems to have worked out. Don't let anyone tell you who you can be. Be who you want to be. That's my message.

Last week, one of my favorite shows, The Colbert Report, was harshly criticized because of a tweet: an out-of-context joke about the “Ching-Chong-Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever.” 
Upon reading this tweet, Suey Park, a Twitter activist, sent out a tweet calling for Colbert’s firing with the hashtag #CancelColbert, subsequently creating a newstorm as various media outlets picked up the story. Damn it, news corps, you made me care about a Twitter hashtag.
Even out of context, the joke was not offensive to me, though that may just be because I’ve heard one too many Ricky Gervais jokes about child rape. In context, it is a stretch for anyone to call it offensive; it satirizes Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder’s charitable foundation for Native Americans, which has the term “Redskins” in it. In fact, it reaffirms that “Ching-Chong-Ding-Dong,” like “Redskins,” is racist.
Upon realizing that she had taken the joke out of context, Park told people that she didn’t actually want Colbert’s show to be canceled, and that she used the hashtag to raise awareness for her broader message.
Supporters of #CancelColbert claim that comedy should not use racial stereotypes, and that satire has to be completely clear about who it is ridiculing because people could misinterpret the use of subtle anti-racist humor as a green light to use actual racist humor.
There is no special reason why comedy in particular, along with every other kind of entertainment and speech that exists, should not use or discuss racial stereotypes. These stereotypes won’t go away if we stop talking about them. Furthermore, all speech can be misinterpreted. For instance, Glenn Beck used Martin Luther King, Jr.’s speeches for his conservative causes despite King’s advocacy for liberal causes. The value of any form of speech should not be determined by the people who misuse it.
Colbert’s critics also claim that white men should not comment on race, which is a fairly ridiculous assertion. Being white doesn’t mean you can’t make good points about race. Furthermore, conversation about race relations should aim at being inclusive rather than exclusive.
More disturbing is the number of people who claim that Park’s tactic of overreaction, calling to cancel Colbert’s show, was justifiable in raising these concerns.
Fox News pulled a similar stunt in 2010, when it took a quote from then-government official Shirley Sherrod out of context, painting the content of one of her speeches as a diatribe against whites, when in reality it was a personal story of racial healing. As a result, Sherrod was forced to resign from her position as Georgia State Director of Rural Development for the United States Department of Agriculture.
It is unlikely that a celebrity like Colbert would be fired due to #CancelColbert, but suppose Park’s target had not been Colbert, but some business owner or teacher whose words were taken out of context. The tactics used by Park and Fox News are irresponsible and have the potential to damage the careers and lives of innocent individuals.
Some people may wonder why I’m not criticizing the commentators who sent rape and death threats to Park. Their behavior is vastly more reprehensible, but no reasonable person actually thinks such behavior is justified. On the other hand, a lot of legitimately influential people seem to agree with #CancelColbert on the views I have mentioned.
Also note that this is not a commentary on social justice in general, but rather on these specific viewpoints that certain members of the community hold. There is a place in the world for social justice, in a society where minorities are still culturally and politically underrepresented. However, insular and sterilized conversations peppered with knee-jerk reactions do not in any way advance social justice causes.

American Exceptionalism is in crisis mode. Maybe President Obama articulated it best when he was asked about it in 2008. 
“Sure I believe in American Exceptionalism,” he said, “just like the Brits believe in British Exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek Exceptionalism.”
Some people just don’t believe in American Exceptionalism anymore. Some people actually find the whole notion of American Exceptionalism to be unfounded, nationalistic hubris created to justify American cockiness and aggressive foreign policy. While American Exceptionalism and its drivers are changing, we are still an exceptional nation, but for different reasons and with different implications than before.
To understand this change, one must first understand the origins of American Exceptionalism and what it has historically meant. The idea of American Exceptionalism is commonly traced back to Governor John Winthrop’s 1630 “A Model of Christian Charity” speech. Winthrop declared, “For we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us.”
Contrary to popular belief, Winthrop meant that Europe would be watching to see how the American experiment unfolded, not that we’re somehow on a pedestal above other nations. He understood that the New World provided a platform for trying new governance. If we succeeded, then people would voluntarily follow our example. The concept of American Exceptionalism was never meant to prove that we were better than everyone else, just different: the exception to the European rule.
As American society wore on, we developed three factors that set us apart from Europe. First amongst them is our religiosity. As Alexis de Tocqueville noted in his famous Democracy In America, we have historically been a very religious set of people, and that sets us apart from many other nations. de Tocqueville noted that, because Americans were so religious, we were more inclined to work hard, adhere to strict moral codes, believe in personal responsibility, take pride in being self-sufficient, and uphold family values.
Additionally, the United States has always been a unique defender of freedom at home and abroad. Internationally, we were the force that turned the tide in both world wars and, domestically, our Constitution was designed to safeguard against tyranny in all forms with careful checks and balances of power. Mitt Romney took to calling the United States “the hope of the Earth” throughout his 2012 campaign, reflecting on our commitment to propagating liberty.
Finally, the circumstances of our country’s founding were exceptional. We were one of the first successful anti-colonial revolutions, and we birthed a country that did not have a history in feudalism. Because of these circumstances, social mobility and opportunity have abounded in the United States, and the idea of a Marxist proletariat working class, stuck in squalor, is foreign. We generally believe that hard work can get anyone ahead.
Of course, these three factors don’t have positive connotations to many groups of people in our country. Religiosity is definitely declining, especially amongst younger generations, and religiosity is the main driving force for pro-life and anti-LGBT movements, further alienating more and more people as the national dialogue becomes more accepting.
Additionally, as we look back on slavery and racism in America, it’s increasingly apparent that we were only guardians of domestic freedom for white men until about 50 years ago, and even now we’re a far cry from living in a colorblind society. Also, guarding freedom abroad gets us into nationally and internationally unpopular wars, notably Iraq and Vietnam.   
Finally, after the recent recession, the middle class has become increasingly worse off, and social mobility has been damaged. As a recent study by The Equality of Opportunity Project noted, American social mobility is not the same as it was 50 years ago.
Clearly, American Exceptionalism and its drivers are changing, but perhaps appropriately. Fleeing religious persecution, dying for freedom, and starting fresh on new land aren’t even distant memories anymore — they’ve entered into the lexicon of American folklore. But a change in the factors that birthed American Exceptionalism doesn’t spell its demise. We are still an incredibly unique nation, relying on two new factors to create a lifestyle and culture that can’t be found anywhere else in the world: entrepreneurship and federalism.
Religiosity contributed to Exceptionalism because it drove people to put in an honest day’s work and lead a virtuous lifestyle in the eyes of God. Religion is declining as a motivating factor, but there are people in this country working harder than their religious predecessors, driven instead by their passion and ambition. 
The United States has become the global capitol of entrepreneurship, touting enterprising, risk-taking visionaries who sleep under their desks and work long hours into nights and weekends to follow their dreams and create something they believe in. While your stereotypical religious family man is seen less and less, entrepreneurs are creating their own brand of rugged, individualistic apotheosis. It’s hard to imagine the lexicon of American folklore 100 years from now without the names Zuckerberg, Gates, and Jobs. Without the fear of God, startup culture is promoting hard work and driving economic growth in a way that’s unique to this country.
In the San Francisco area alone, there were 7,439 new ventures last year, and in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Pittsburgh combined there were 7,744, according to StartupBio.me. Compare that to all of Western Europe, which had a total of 2,917 new ventures, and it becomes apparent that religion isn’t necessary to sustain the levels of hard work that make our country exceptional.
Aiding entrepreneurship in keeping America exceptional, our federalist system of government provides a platform for experimental governance seen nowhere else in the world. The system of states being able to experiment with most powers of government, while all living under one prosperous federal framework, gives our government the ability to adapt to new circumstances much quicker than other countries, and also allows us to try new policies with limited consequences.
Examples of federalism are far reaching and varied. SeaTac, a city in Washington, recently raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour in an effort to explore the effects a higher minimum wage would have on the community. In 2011, Vermont passed statewide legislation that created, essentially, the first single-payer healthcare system in the country. Additionally, Colorado and Washington have experimented with legalizing recreational marijuana, and states across the union have started allowing same-sex couples to get married.
These changes have had an effect in Washington and across the globe. The Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act as a response to state-by-state same-sex marriage legalization. This decision has brought the issue of same-sex marriage into the national dialogue in places like Ireland and Chile, where same-sex marriage is still considered taboo. 
No other country has a platform for intranational legislative experimentation the way that the United States does, and as the role of government in people’s lives continues to change, federalism paves the way for continued innovation and improvement.
Throughout the course of history, our willingness to try new things — whether we succeed or fail — has paved the way for improvement across the globe. From the immeasurable amount of good that cell phones are doing to lift people out of poverty in Africa, to understanding that alcohol bans aren’t going to work, America’s differences have made the world a better place.
As Winthrop noted almost 400 years ago, people around the world look to our example to learn. We don’t have to be better or worse than any other country, just different. Let’s keep America weird.

It’s almost been a month since the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was declared lost, and almost two weeks since it was officially declared to have crashed in the South Indian Ocean. 
As numerous planes scour the seas for any sign of wreckage or debris, we — the onlookers — have followed the news story from the start. We have seen the countless theories surrounding the flight, including everything from the pilot and his co-pilot, stolen passports, hijackings, and the Illuminati.
It is important to follow current events, yes. They make us well-informed citizens and enable us to participate in a public dialogue with our friends, professors, and whomever else we meet. But there comes a point when we are overloaded with information from the press. The press has reached maximum capacity when it comes to Flight 370.
In the past month, I have received more than 10 mobile pings that have said, “Potential debris spotted in Indian (or South China Sea) Ocean” or some other variant. In fact, according to The Huffington Post, CNN reporter Martin Savidge has spent the past month or so in a flight simulator testing Flight 370 theories, inspiring the Twitter trending hashtag #freemartinsavidge.
Despite the extensive media coverage, there have been few significant developments in the past month regarding the flight. These developments have included, first, that the flight had disappeared; second, that it has been declared lost in an area in the South Indian Ocean using satellite data, complex calculations, and the Doppler effect; and last, that there have been possible debris sightings close to the area where the plane is believed to have passed through.
But as each day passes without confirmed sighting of the wreckage, the media — CNN in particular because of its wide, expansive coverage — has resorted to excruciatingly aggravating extrapolation. In fact, one headline on CNN even read “Was Flight 370 a Zombie Plane?” There have been theories — none of which are substantiated in any way — regarding terror plots, hijackings, and a secret message from the plane before it vanished. Not only is CNN covering the story this way, but the other “Big Two” — Fox and NBC — have joined in, perhaps in an effort to boost television ratings in an era where news is more mobile and Internet-based.
I’m not saying that the CNN or news outlets should not be covering Flight 370. In fact, there are some fascinating stories behind it. For example, Malaysia’s public relations and general management of the flight’s disappearance have been criticized internationally. Therein lies the potential for a story with concrete facts and credible sources, one that would not be an extrapolation.
However, on the other side of the TV are viewers obsessed with finding this flight. Something within our human subconscious is drawn to such tragedies, and the surrealism of a plane crash contributes to our fascination. Flights, which used to be considered a luxury, are now considered to be essential. Air travel has connected the world by making it so much easier to traverse.
As a result of this accessibility, there is a sense of security, ease, and comfort, even, to be traveling in a metal bird thousands of miles above the ground. Then, an incident like Flight 370 comes along and disrupts our confidence in such a sense. As a result, we are compelled to understand what went wrong, and how Flight 370 differed from the millions of others. 
That being said, there are several issues with the way the “Big Three” — CNN, NBC, and Fox — have been capitalizing on this innate public interest in the doomed flight. The outlets, by throwing speculations and extrapolations, have left us confused and lead us to question their authority and integrity on such relatable, high-profile incidents.

No longer will students be able to double-book themselves for classes during registration. In an email sent out to the student body on Thursday, University Registrar John Papinchak detailed that, in order for students to register for two conflicting courses, they need to run it by their academic adviser before registration, and must gain permission to take them concurrently.
Trying to juggle courses that meet at the same time is a risky move for students; while it’s sometimes necessary in order for them to complete their coursework before they graduate or for other valid extenuating circumstances, there is no reason why the option should be open to students from the start of registration. 
Also, some students that have trouble deciding which courses to take often overload themselves with courses — some of which overlap — in order to try each of them, then drop the ones they don’t like as much. The new registration policy will make this practice more difficult.
The Associate Deans’ Council made a smart move in implementing this new registration policy. Not only does it encourage students to make decisions about their next semester’s course work earlier on, but it also helps alleviate some stress among the student body. Carnegie Mellon is known for its stressful and academically intense environment, and balancing two classes at the same time contributes to that environment. In a roundabout way, the faculty and administration are helping to combat Carnegie Mellon’s “stress culture” with this new policy.
Admittedly, this new policy may prevent students from getting some of the classes that they want. Some people have back-up classes lined up so that they have a second option ready and waiting in case they don’t get off the waitlist for their first-choice class that meets at the same time, but now students have to decide if they want to risk getting off the waitlist for that class or take the safer route with a different, more accessible course. 
Despite this drawback, the policy will help ease both the registration process and students’ stress levels.

University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) surgeons will soon begin human trials on suspended animation, which is more formally known in the medical community as emergency preservation and resuscitation, according to Medical Daily. 
The technique is intended to give doctors more time to fix life-threatening wounds, such as gunshot or stab wounds, and has been a resounding success in non-human trials. The pigs used in those trials survived the procedure with no cognitive or physical impairments. The procedure will only be used on patients in cardiac arrest, and it involves replacing all the blood in the body with a cold saline solution, which induces a physical state very similar to hypothermia. If the procedure is successful, other hospitals will begin to implement it. 
UPMC should be commended for its willingness to innovate and try potentially dangerous procedures in a cautious manner. Obviously, the hospital is not attempting the technique on any and all patients who come into the emergency room. According to Dr. Samuel A. Tisherman, the lead surgeon in these trials, speaking to The Huffington Post, the ideal patient for the procedure would be someone who was admitted to the hospital with a fatal gunshot or stab wound, and who did not respond to the conventional treatments the hospital currently employs. 
Choosing only patients on the edge of death avoids the potential ethical minefield of using such extreme methods in human trials. However, the FDA does not require approval from the patient or the family, as the patient would die without some kind of extreme intervention. 
The procedure itself sounds unnerving, like something out of science fiction, especially as the patient will be clinically dead for a few hours and then revived. Risky medical procedures, especially in human trials, should not be taken lightly; hospitals should carefully consider how they implement these techniques. 
UPMC has clearly considered the risks and is going about these trials in a measured and methodical way. This unconventional technique has the potential to save lives.

Last week the results from the student body elections revealed that Ian Glasner and Shalini Ray were elected as student body president and vice president, respectively. Glasner and Ray displayed a great deal of confidence and experience in the debates held prior to the election and have an ambitious platform promised for their upcoming term.
It’s important for Glasner and Ray to remember and be accountable for these goals, ranging from reforms of the dining system to changing the dorm alcohol policy on campus. During the SBP/SBVP debates, they displayed their knowledge of the systems related to student government and campus administration in an impressive manner, especially with Glasner referencing meetings he held with various campus officials regarding the issues being campaigned on. However, a few topics — specifically the dorm alcohol policy — will be difficult to accomplish. Glasner and Ray need to put their utmost effort into representing the wishes of our student body and carrying out their initiatives in a practical and well-reasoned way.
Glasner and Ray exhibited remarkable poise and institutional knowledge prior to their election, and we hope that they will continue to impress as they assume their respective student government roles.
Similarly, recently-elected Student Body Vice President for Finance (SBVPF) Divya Kothandapani and Student Body Vice President for Organizations (SBVPO) Jack Michalak must strive to fulfill their duties to the student body as they assume office.
Kothandapani’s campaign platform did not promise reforms as bold as those suggested by SBP and SBVP candidates, but her desire for a more comprehensible budgeting process would be an excellent addition to the current system.
Michalak campaigned on goals including expediting the organization recognition process and improving how student organizations receive advice. His platform also addressed supporting broader initiatives such as improving room selection, the installation of gender-neutral restrooms, and expanding the amnesty policy to cover drugs. While all important topics, Michalak should focus most of his efforts on accomplishing what is most in his power to do so. As a sophomore, Michalak has the opportunity to run for higher student office, where he’d have greater power to tackle and throw greater support behind some of these broader reforms. 
The Tartan congratulates the newly elected SBP, SBVP, SBVPF, SBVPO, as well as the college senators. We hope that those elected will be accountable for their promises and work with the student body to build a better campus community.

Today is a relaxing day, provided you make the necessary effort to deal with material constraints. You would like nothing more than to plan fun activities for the future. 
There's a lot on your mind today. Over the last few weeks, you've analyzed your relationships and now new people with attractive qualities are tempting you to make a change. Is this a good time to accept the upheaval such changes would create? 
The past few days have been quite serious, but today you awaken with a light heart and boundless energy. Your capacity for charm will be at its peak. People at work will yield to your wishes today.
You could be feeling a little overwhelmed and overworked. Perhaps the demands of your professional life are weighing heavily on your mind. Don't worry; these feelings will pass.
Are you feeling grumpy lately? Don't worry, because your bad mood won't last. This attitude is unlike you. Your co-workers notice the change in your personality, but still treat you with consideration and respect.
You have to work hard to achieve your purpose. Every day, it's as if you carry around an overstuffed sandbag. This would be a good day to identify the source of this trouble.
You may have an urge to invent new things. You feel compelled to create something in the technical, artistic, or philosophical field. If only you'd given yourself enough time to pursue these ideas. Maybe today is the day to recognize them. 
Generally, you come up with a perfect, witty answer one day too late. Impulse and intuition take a back seat to your great self-control. Today, you will be presented with an opportunity to let go of those constraints.
Today, you'll be inspired to revamp your role models and lighten your workload. Equality in the home is just as important as equality in the workplace.
There is some likelihood of a slight career conflict. You might have to deal with a comrade who steps on your toes and takes advantage of your gentle nature to push you around. Defend yourself with your favorite weapons: silence, laughter, and perspective.
Don't fret about your appearance today. You've been questioning the way you act and dress lately, and those fears should be relinquished. Don't use your judgment to hurt yourself.
Take this day to think about your private life; be particularly sensitive to all kinds of demands from those closest to you. You have the power to create greater harmony at home and in your relationship.
