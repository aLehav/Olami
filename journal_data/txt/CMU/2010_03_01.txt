About 18 months ago, I wrote in this space about the compelling role team sports had taken in the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, despite the slew of individual competitions that make up the Olympiad. It would seem much harder to make this contention for its winter counterpart, where the athletic and the artistic are brought together through various individual games. Still, it was a team sport that had been simmering just offstage before stealing the show with its epic conclusion yesterday. Some of the greatest moments in the Vancouver Winter Olympic Games were brought about by the great American afterthought: hockey.
The National Hockey League (NHL) could not have asked for better advertisement. With star athletes Sidney Crosby and Alexander Ovechkin leading the powerhouse national teams of Canada and Russia, respectively, fans of the game were excited for what they expected to be a monumental showdown between these two teams in the gold medal game. But what actually happened drew those who had never watched a game of hockey to their televisions sets. When the United States defeated top-seeded Canada in preliminary play, it was the largest upset in hockey history, surpassed only by the Miracle on Ice 30 years ago. In one game, the entire landscape of the tournament, along with perception towards U.S. hockey, shifted.
Olympic hockey is recognized as being faster-paced and more skill-heavy than what fans are used to in the NHL. There is a higher premium on puck movement with rules put in place to reduce checking and eliminate fighting. Watching the best players in the world play under these conditions is something to behold, something first-time watchers have been realizing as they have tuned in to watch America’s unexpected Olympic run.
The U.S. team surprised Canada in its first outing with its aggressive play, fitted to the narrower North American rink being used in Vancouver. They made up for the talent gap that existed between them and team Canada by being grittier — fighting harder for pucks along the boards and constantly forcing the puck toward the net, ultimately muscling a win from Canada. This, coupled with great goalkeeping by Ryan Miller, allowed them to come out of the round robin preliminary round undefeated and seeded first. Suddenly, Russia and Canada were no longer on track to meet in the finals but much earlier in the quarterfinals. And suddenly, Canada’s chief rival was no longer the equally talented Russia, who they eventually disposed of easily, but the hard-playing United States.
What all of us were witnessing was the mark of team competition in its purest form. It is impossible for one player to carry a team in Olympic-style hockey, as is the case at times in the NHL. With all participating players already at the highest skill level, what separates each team from the others is their chemistry and ability to stick to a sound strategy. Team USA was able to play to its strengths. There was nothing flashy about any of the goals that they scored — the hallmark of Team USA in these Olympics was heavy pressure along the boards of the offensive zone and crashing the net. Early on, Canada and Russia seemed content with allowing their most talented players to create their own offense, which led to breathtaking goals, but both teams ran into trouble early on when they met more physical and cross-checking teams like the United States, Slovakia, and Switzerland.
The result was one of the most physical and close preliminary rounds in Olympic hockey history, setting the stage for one of the greatest hockey games ever played.
For the Americans, it was a story about their David to Canada’s Goliath. And for the Canadians, it was a story of redemption. It was fitting that the United States and Canada met again in the gold medal game. Canada had gone on to score a combined 15 goals in the two games following their loss to the United States, and seemed to have adopted the aggressive play the Americans had incorporated during their upset. Both teams seemed unstoppable leading up to the final game, and that the United States was able to score a tying goal with 24 seconds left in the final by frantically crashing the net was as much a shock as it was, well, completely appropriate.
Canada, in the end, got its redemption, finally winning a hockey gold medal on home soil. Canada’s sudden-death goal was not the prettiest Sidney Crosby ever scored — fighting the puck away from the board and forcing a shot on goal — but in the end, results counted more than style.
Canadians undoubtedly will have been celebrating this victory as a nation in a way the United States could not have done. But Americans are surely mourning this hockey loss unlike any they have before. Hopefully, this gives Americans around the nation reason to start attending local NHL games or to pick up the hockey stick that is gathering dust in their basement. One would hope that this was simply the start of a cross-border rivalry that has up until today been purely one-sided.

This past weekend, the Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team, ranked sixth in Division III, traveled to DePauw University to compete in the ITA National Team Indoor Championships. Going into the tournament looking to defend their title, the Tartans came home with a disappointing seventh-place finish after defeating Johns Hopkins University in their final match. The Tartans now have a blemish on their otherwise spotless record, and move to 5–2.
On Friday, the Tartans, seeded fourth in the tournament, squared off against number-eight Denison University, regarded by many to be one of the best teams in the country. The Tartans dug themselves an early hole, as they got swept in doubles to immediately go down 3–0. With their title hopes looking bleaker by the second, the Tartans went down without much fight, losing the match by an overall score of 8–1. 
First-year Alex Tapak recorded the lone Tartan win at third singles in a grueling three set match.
The Tartans woke up the next day for an 8:30 a.m. match looking to bounce back from their disappointing loss, and faced Gustavus Adolphus College in the first round of the consolation bracket. The doubles team of junior Ashley Herrick and sophomore Laura Chen staked Carnegie Mellon to an early 1–0 lead by winning at first doubles by a score of 8–3. Unfortunately for the Tartans, they dropped the remaining two doubles matches and went into singles down 2–1.
Chen again started off the scoring at first singles, cruising to a 6–0, 6–0 win. With a win at second singles by sophomore Courtney Chin, 6–2, 6–4, the Tartans were in pretty good shape going into the remaining matches. However, losses at third and fourth singles tightened the match and put Gustavus ahead. Soon enough, Gustavus rallied from deficits at fifth and sixth singles to snatch victory from the reeling Tartan tennis team.
After the two disappointing losses to Denison and Gustavus, the Tartans went into their seventh-place match against Johns Hopkins with a feeling of failure. However, this did not stop them from taking care of business, as the Tartans swept doubles behind a strong victory from the newly formed first doubles team of Chen and Chin. 
Going into the singles matches up 3–0, the Tartans finished off Hopkins with a flurry of wins by sophomore Cze-Ja Tam 6–2, 6–2, and junior Kelly Hart, 5–7, 6–3, 1–0 (12-10). The Tartans forcefully –ulled themselves together and took their only win by the score of 7–2.
“A lot of things went wrong this weekend,” Tam stated. “We didn’t have the right winning attitude the whole tournament, which brought us down. What we do from this point will determine our strength and character, not this past weekend.”
Sophomore Laura Chen shared her teammate’s sentiments. “I think we all need to straighten out our priorities and work together as a team to make these losses a distant past. We have our spring break trip next week and another round of matches — a chance for redemption.” 
“We completely forgot the significance of ‘national’ when we went to this national team championship,” Tapak said. “These teams were very tough and we just got outplayed. But it’s still early in the season, so we can move forward from this point. We know what our weaknesses are and we can focus on getting better.”
The Tartans will travel to Claremont, Calif. over spring break to take on a series of tough opponents and hope to prove themselves once again.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s alpine ski team traveled last weekend to Blue Mountain in Palmerton, Pa., to compete in the 2010 United States Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association (USCSA) Mid-Atlantic Regional Championships. 
The team qualified to compete in the regional competition by finishing third out of 10 teams in the Allegheny Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Conference (ACSC), after five in-conference races from January through February. The five-year-old team, made up of 30 students, has now qualified for regional competition two years in a row.
Alpine ski racing in the USCSA consists of two events: slalom and giant slalom (GS). These are two downhill skiing events featured in the Winter Olympics. Slalom is a race involving quick turning and precision, whereas GS features wider radius turns at higher speeds.
During conference competition in the ACSC, Carnegie Mellon recorded its best ski season to date with third-place finishes from both the women’s and men’s team. The ACSC’s top teams include Penn State, Bucknell, Villanova, and the Naval Academy. The women’s team’s high point of the season came during the fourth weekend of competition, when the team placed second.
The team was also well represented on the individual level. Sophomore Nicola Carey, a civil engineering major, placed ninth in the season out of 70 women in the conference. Carey finished every race during the season, and had a season-best finish of eighth during the first race at Wisp in Maryland. 
Junior Ben Streeter, a mechanical engineering major, finished ninth out of 70 men in the conference. Streeter’s best finish of the season, sixth, came at Elk Mountain’s GS race. Rounding out the Tartans was junior Jeff Bizzak, also a mechanical engineering major, who finished the season in 11th place and landed in the top 10 in three different races. These individual results are a great accomplishment: Historically, no Tartan racer had ever finished a season in the top 10.
Streeter shared his thoughts about Carnegie Mellon’s best season yet. “I am thankful that our team was able to put together a great season start to finish. This was due to many contributions from every individual on the team. The team’s enthusiasm about skiing, in addition to the thrill of competition and the challenge of skiing, makes ski racing a great sport,” he said.
Although the race season is now over for the Tartans, the team looks forward to another season of competition beginning next January.

This past weekend, the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s swimming and diving team competed at the University of Pittsburgh in the East Coast Athletic Conference (ECAC) Championships.
The Tartans kicked off their meet on the second day of competition. The first event, the women’s 200-yard medley relay, with the team of first-year Dorothy Yu, first-year Breanna Stillo, junior Molly Evans, and junior Brianne Burton, were disqualified. The next event Carnegie Mellon competed in was the women’s 200-yard freestyle, with first-year Sarah Musial placing 47th with a time of 2:02.56 in the preliminaries. In the men’s 200-yard freestyle, junior Josh Mathews placed eighth in the preliminaries with a time of 1:42.24, a time fast enough to qualify for the ‘A’ finals, where he placed seventh with a time of 1:41.86, a season best. First-year Breanna Stillo placed 13th in the preliminaries of the women’s 100-yard breaststroke with a time of 1:06.97, along with senior Sara Andrews swimming in a time of 1:07.55 and placing 17th.
Mathews started off the meet for Carnegie Mellon on Sunday, swimming the men’s 100-yard freestyle and placing 16th in the preliminaries, with a time of 47.08, assuring him a spot in the ‘B’ final. In the women’s 200-yard breaststroke, Yu hit a time of 2:28.15, finishing 19th, and first-year Price Kinney placed 26th in the same event, touching in just two seconds later.
In the women’s 200-yard butterfly, junior Rebecca Ussai swam a time of 2:11.12, finishing 23rd. On the men’s side, junior Justin Whaley placed 16th with a time of 1:54.63, earning him a spot in the ‘B’ finals, while first-year Brandon Yee placed 20th, finishing in 1:56.42.
“I didn’t do as well as I wanted to, but it felt good to get another race in before the season ended,” Yu said, reflecting on her season. “Even though only about 10 of us swam this weekend, the rest of the team came and cheered us on.”
The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams will next be in action at the NCAA Championships March 20–23 at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team played its final match of the season on Saturday, falling to the Spartans of Case Western Reserve University 51–71. 
The Tartans struggled through most of the season winning just one of their last 18 games. The Carnegie Mellon team ended the season 5–20 overall and just 1–13 in University Athletic Association (UAA) play.
With the stands packed with men’s basketball alumni and parents, five seniors stepped on the court with high energy for their final game. The game was close early in the half, with each team going bucket-for-bucket. A jumper by junior Shane Rife put the Tartans within one of the Spartans with 13:48 remaining in the half. However, over the next eight minutes the Tartans were held to just one field goal as Case Western Reserve improved their lead to 30–14. As the teams headed into their locker rooms for the break the scoreboard read 37–19 in favor of the visitors.
Coach Anthony Wingen must have sparked a fire in the locker room, as the Tartans went on a 12–4 run to start the second half, pulling within 10 points of Case Western Reserve. The 10-point deficit was as close as the Tartans would come to taking the lead, as the Spartans pulled away for the rest of the game.
The Tartans shot just 31.1 percent from the floor compared to the Spartans’ 45 percent. The Tartans were also out -rebounded by the visiting team 45–34.
Senior Jack Anderson once again led the Tartans with 14 points, followed by sophomore John Duhring with 13 and Rife with 10. 
While the Tartans struggled this season, it was not all bad for Anderson, who led the Tartans overall in three categories. Anderson posted 401 points for the season, 64 assists, and 24 steals.
“I had a great career at Carnegie Mellon,” Anderson said. “We had a lot of success over the years and there have been a lot of great players to come through this program.”

The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team hosted Case Western Reserve University on Saturday. Despite strong performances from senior Rachelle Roll and first-year Emily Peel, the Tartans fell to the Spartans with a final score of 66–83. The Tartans finished their season with an overall record of 9–16 and a record of 2–12 in University Athletic Association (UAA) play.
The Spartans took an early lead, and 10:15 in to the game, they were up 24–14. The Tartans then went on an 8–0 run to pull within two, helped mostly by Peel, who scored six of those points en route to an eight-point first half. 
Shortly thereafter, the Spartans took off with the scoring with a 23–8 run that buried the Tartans in a 52–34 hole at the half. 
Despite the deficit, the Tartans had scored a season high for first-half points in conference play.
The Spartans picked up right where they left off as they began the second half with a 12–2 run, putting the Tartans’ deficit at 64–36. Case never looked back, and the closest Carnegie Mellon got to their opponents was when they trailed 76–62, with 2:03 to go in the game.
Roll was one of the bright spots for the Tartans on Saturday as she shot eight-for-eight from the line in the first half, along with her eight rebounds. Roll ended her final collegiate game with a career-best 22 points and 15 rebounds.
Other strong performers for the Tartans included Peel, who had a career-best 17 points and 10 rebounds, and sophomore Jennifer Larsen, who scored 13.
Despite their losing record, the Tartans’ season was an improvement over their 2008–09 performance. They will look for better luck and further improvement when their next season begins in the fall.

The Tartan women’s basketball team has had a roller coaster season, starting strong and hitting a few rough patches due to injuries and close-fought contests. One of the peaks of this active season occurred on Feb. 12 in Skibo Gymnasium, as the Lady Tartans took on Emory University in a University Athletic Association (UAA) competition. First-year Brit Phillips sunk a buzzer-beater jump shot to send the game into overtime, where Carnegie Mellon clinched the victory.
Phillips’ strong presence on the court has fortunately carried over from a successful high school career at Normandy High School in Parma, Ohio. While there, Phillips was a four-year varsity starter and a three-year captain, as well as the conference’s Most Valuable Player and an All-Academic Athlete. Phillips cites her father as her most influential inspiration in pursuing her basketball passion after she took up the sport in first grade. While part of the off-season has to be devoted to maintaining her fitness and drive to improve, Phillips also enjoys catching up on the latest television shows and books. She enjoys snowboarding, but the lengthy basketball season has left it to be a hobby that Phillips can pursue after her college career.
While currently seeking a major in mathematical sciences, Phillips is also interested in computational finance. Having a busy schedule has helped with time management, but Phillips is definitely looking forward to the upcoming break: “I plan to sleep in as much as possible, and maybe earn some money if I can. But mostly just relax. The Cavaliers are playing the Celtics on March 14 [and] I’ll be there.” 
Whether it’s leading on the basketball court, being a conscientious student or enjoying free time, Phillips seems to be fitting right in at Carnegie Mellon University, and will be taking on her next three years.

Many regard music as the universal language. But getting robots to speak any language is harder than it seems.
Eric Singer is a musician who also holds an electrical and computer engineering degree from Carnegie Mellon. However, his passion for music was too great to ignore, and he studied music synthesis in the Berklee College of Music after graduating. “I’ve been a sax player since grade school and have been interested and involved in technology for about as long,” Singer said. With this mindset, he created innovative musical robots, using them to play along with some of the most famous musicians.
Singer founded LEMUR, or the League of Electronic Musical Urban Robots, in 2000 as a means of combining musical instruments and robotics. The group, according to Singer, has “had about 100 members in the form of contributing artists, technologists, and apprentices.” It has already created a variety of robotic instruments. Some of the most memorable include GuitarBot, a four-stringed robot that plucks strings — the pitch can be altered by moving sliders up and down the strings. Singer described his update to GuitarBot: “I’ve just spent the last year creating GuitarBot Mark II, an updated, sexier, and more reliable version of the original.” In addition, some robots can be manipulated by humans. “My favorites have been the Slime-o-trons, which use conductive ‘slime’ to control musical algorithms, and the Slink-o-trons, which convert the motion of Slinkys into musical controls,” Singer said. Many of his instruments have intrigued musicians looking for something new, including world-famous guitarist Pat Metheny, who recorded with a set of robotic instruments on his album Orchestrion, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
Besides musical instruments, Singer also programs performance systems that interact with live performances. One, called Cyclops, according to www.ericsinger.com, controls a variety of stage equipment including cameras, audio, video, and robotics. He also created interactive musicians that listen to live performers and actively play along with them.
One of the goals of LEMUR is to find new ways to create music. “The current reality is that 99 percent of the music that is created involves the use of electronics and technology in some way or another,” Singer said. “Short of beating drums around a bonfire, musicians are going to use technology in some part of recording, performing, or creating music.” Singer focuses on exotic and lesser-known instruments, and he also is inspired by non-musical objects; he tries to find ways to make them into instruments. Singer jokes that instruments sometimes come “from the dark, strange recesses of my mind.”
Singer has been interested in both music and robotics since a young age, and it was at Carnegie Mellon that he started to combine his interests. After meeting Richard Boulanger, a music technology professor at Berklee College of Music, he began to uncover different and innovative methods to combine music and technology. Singer’s technical background allowed him to lead the implementation of his ideas: “I do all the electronics, PCB design, firmware, and most of the control software for LEMUR’s instruments and installations.” More information can be found at www.lemurbots.org and www.ericsinger.com.

In the wild, when animals have poor vision, they must use their other senses to make their way around. For decades, studies have suggested that humans too may be able to navigate without using their eyes, but until now this possibility was not confirmed.
A 2009 study from the University of Alcalá de Henares (UAH) in Spain has proven that humans are capable of echolocation, which is used by animals like dolphins and bats. While this ability is not one most humans would claim to use, it is a skill that can be developed. It will be especially useful, scientists believe, for the blind and for rescue workers.
Echolocation relies upon sound in order to navigate and explore. Animals use echolocation to determine the proximity of an object or objects by making clicking sounds and listening for the echo of that sound. By observing the amount of time that elapses between the click and its echo, animals can determine how close or how far away the object is. This works in a way similar to vision. Both seeing and hearing rely upon the reflection of waves (light waves for seeing and sound waves for hearing), and by learning to interpret reflected sound waves, humans can explore the world through sound rather than through sight.
According to this study, humans are capable of learning to listen and interpret sounds to navigate the world without using sight. Unlike in the animal world, however, this ability is not something that comes naturally.
In order to use echolocation, humans would need to participate in a training process to learn how to properly interpret the information they receive. First, a person must learn how to make the proper sounds. According to a June 2009 ScienceDaily.com article, Juan Antonio Martínez, the lead author of the study, believes that “palate clicks” are the best sound to use for echolocation. Palate clicks are made by placing the tongue on the palate, directly behind the teeth, and moving it rapidly backwards.
Once the sound is mastered, learning to use echolocation requires a great deal of practice. Echolocation trainees should practice using clicks to determine whether there are objects in front of them, beginning with small objects and moving on to larger ones. With enough practice, echolocation can be used to determine not only how far an object is, but potentially what kind or size of object is present.
While the possibility of humans using echolocation was only recently confirmed, people have been training themselves to use sounds to judge distances and help with navigation for quite some time. One of the most famous self-taught echolocation users was Ben Underwood. He had his eyes removed because of retinal cancer at the age of two and began to use echolocation to get around at the age of five.
Underwood died of cancer in 2009 at age 16, but in the years before his death, he managed to become proficient in the use of echolocation. YouTube videos and a documentary show Underwood riding a bicycle, playing basketball, and even playing video games, all without the use of sight. Underwood’s ability to use only echolocation to determine what was around him was unique, as he used no other aids to help him around. Instead, he chose to fine-tune his ability to judge his surroundings via sound.
Another well known human echolocation user is Daniel Kish, who also lost his vision due to retinal cancer as a child. Kish taught himself how to use echolocation, determining what kinds of objects were around him, as well as how far away they were. Now, Kish works to help other blind people learn to use echolocation to increase their mobility.
While human echolocation has reportedly been used since the 18th century to help blind humans get around, it was not confirmed or understood until recently that all humans are capable of echolocation with the proper training and practice. Scientists believe that while this skill is very useful for the blind, it is also potentially beneficial for rescue workers, like firefighters, who need to navigate in situations where it is impossible to see clearly, such as smoky rooms.

At the rate at which technology is being developed, it is easy to get lost in a bombardment of tech words and fancy lingo referring to new pieces of hardware and software. One of these words that has gained more attention in recent times is the term “cloud computing.” Upon hearing the term, it is probably not entirely clear what it is or how it works, but for those who have used some form of cloud computing service themselves, it is evident why it has become a buzzword used even at the top levels of the software and information technology industries.
Cloud computing may be simpler than it seems. Think of a network of computers that are either linked for the use of a company or people simply working on a similar project. In order to make sure that progress occurs as efficiently as possible, it is important that each person is equipped with the right hardware and software to do his or her job. Additionally, when dealing with a project that may eventually expand, it is also important to consider the costs of paying for licensing of additional members, costs of additional data storage, and even upgrades in software versions. This would normally be frustrating for any group using conventional file sharing or file transfer methods. With cloud computing, however, many of these problems are easily resolved. By abstracting key aspects of a project, such as memory storage and file sharing, and providing them as a service on the Internet, the project becomes more scalable and dynamic, while maintaining structure and simplicity in use, according to www.cloudcomputing.sys-con.com.
Among people who are more familiar with computing and its terminology, cloud computing has often been compared to grid computing, utility computing, and autonomic computing. Grid computing commonly refers to a cluster of networked, loosely coupled computers that form a virtual supercomputer, used in order to perform very large tasks. Utility computing refers to computing resources that are charged based on the amount of use, similar to utilities such as electricity and water. Autonomic computing refers to computer systems that are capable of self-management. In many ways, certain cloud computing services share common traits with each of these concepts. However, every service exhibits different aspects based on its functionality, and thus cannot be classified into one category or another.
Aside from being scalable and dynamic, cloud computing services are often cost-efficient due to an individual service’s ability to maintain its technological infrastructure on its own, in addition to the utility-based pricing often implemented with its use. Since services are accessible online, information resources can be accessed on any machine with Internet access. Given the centralized structure of these services, security becomes more efficient while maintaining reliability provided by redundant sites in terms of disaster recovery and business continuity. Switching costs associated with cloud computing are often very low. A business looking to transfer their system “to the cloud” can do so with minimal barriers to entry, according to www.howstuffworks.com.
Several cloud computing applications are Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, Managed Service Providers, Service Commerce, and Internet Integration. Services include Salesforce CRM, which is used to automate and organize sales-related activities; Amazon Web Services, which is a group of software services developers can use to build cloud-based systems; and Google App Engine, which is a platform for hosting and developing web applications.
Cloud computing, though relatively new, is slowly starting to have a crucial impact on the way we handle information and Internet resources. It is possible that we may soon see cloud computing implemented as a standard in the near future. What is now known as just another buzzword could become a gateway to a new age of information technology.

Less massive dark matter discovered
In the Soudan mine of Minnesota, two experiments — the Cyrogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMSII) and the Coherent Germanium Neutrino Technology (CoGeNT) — have yielded results that may lead to new information about the size and sensitivity of dark matter, which is thought to be the most abundant form of matter in the universe.
Two weeks ago, CDMSII discovered particles resembling dark matter in the mine. The underground mine is known for its lack of particle activity, meaning there are few subatomic particles in the atmosphere that one would find in abundance at the earth’s surface. CoGeNT reported they observed similar dark matter particles with a smaller mass. Confirmation of the CoGeNT results would, according to physicist Juan Collar, “shift attention to experiments that are sensitive to lower energies,” since detection of the particles occurred at the lower energy sensitivities of the detectors.
Skepticism concerning results has been strong. The less massive CoGeNT particles do not match up with dark matter being investigated by space satellites. The CoGeNT experiment itself may also be faulty, since it is less shielded and more susceptible to unrelated radio waves than the CDMSII.

TigerText creator makes texting private
Following the revelation of golfer Tiger Wood’s numerous affairs and his subsequent apology last week, former recruiter and headhunter Jeffrey Evans responded by creating the TigerText iPhone app, launched on Feb. 25.
With the app, users who may not want their received text messages to be disclosed to others can store them in the TigerText server and set a certain time limit for the message lifespan. After the time limit has expired, the message disappears from both phones and the server. Recipients can see the texts, but they cannot respond. Any incriminating messages, therefore, can be deleted from existence.
Evans denies any claim that the phone was designed for cheating spouses, or that it was named after Tiger Woods in the first place. He designed it primarily to allow iPhone users to have more control over their privacy. Pointing to a ruling by the European Union in 2006 that phone and Internet providers would hold onto texts for a certain period of time, he claimed that the app was directed toward lawyers and business executives.
Whether this app was a practical investment or, as Time puts it, simply “stupidity insurance” remains to be seen.

China and Google have a standoff
China has threatened to shut down Google’s operations inside China due to Google’s decision to reduce censorship on its Chinese website. The situation began when, in late 2009, a series of Internet attacks against several U.S. corporations, including Google, was found to originate in China. The attacks targeted not only the companies, but also the e-mail accounts of several Chinese human-rights activists. In response, Google declared that it would stop restricting searches on its Chinese language search engine, prompting threats from the Chinese government.
Both powers have considerable influence. Google, according to Rebecca MacKinnon of Princeton University’s Center for Information Technology Policy, has a large enough presence “to define the standard operating rules of the Internet.” With the freedom of ideas available online, Google could very well combat any authoritarian regime.
China, however, has had a history of restricting Internet access through a list of blocked IP addresses known as “The Great Firewall.” Although the bandwidth is reaching maximum capacity in the country, China’s circumvention could find any number of unfavorable IP addresses.

The definition of art has been an area of contention possibly from the very first time someone hung a portrait on a wall. Over the years, countless talented artists and art appreciators have struggled to come up with a universally accepted answer, arguing for broader or narrower definitions of art according to their own beliefs about creativity and expression.
One definition that may be a little easier to pin down is that of body art. “That’s basically anything you can do to express yourself, using your own body,” tattoo artist Josh McQuade said as he bent intently over the calligraphic axe design he was drawing. “Anything body, hair, piercings — any way you can express yourself by using yourself.”
McQuade has been a tattoo artist for 18 years and currently works at Jester’s Court on Oakland Avenue. As he sketched at the front desk, a man entered the shop, bringing a gust of snow and a piece of paper clutched in his hand. He greeted McQuade and showed him the paper — it was an ornate dragonfly. An appointment was made and the man left, leaving the design for McQuade to study.“Everyone is different. You can never guess what anyone’s going to get when they first walk in,” he remarked.
The new customer seemed like the type to want a skull emblazoned on his bicep, rather than a dragonfly. This method of stereotyping that comes with society’s perspective on body art and tattoos often masks the meaning behind this art.
“This one probably has a story behind it,” McQuade announced. “It looks like a Maori style. Most of them have stories, but sometimes you get a kid who comes in and asks me to put whatever I want on him. I usually gave those people chicken wings.”
Jack London once said, “Show me a man with a tattoo, and I’ll show you a man with an interesting past.” People throughout history have used tattoos as a way of communicating something about themselves. Maori tattoos signified a person’s status and rank, marking rites of passage and significant events. Yantra tattooing in Thailand supposedly gives protection and magical powers to the wearer.
Over the years, tattoos have served as talismans, status symbols, family associations, and markers of significant events, and they have appeared in numerous societies all around the world.
Today in America, people seem to get tattoos for a variety of reasons, sometimes to mark a meaningful occasion or even simply as a way to acquire a new, distinct accessory. So even though they might not be used for magical purposes today, people still use them to express themselves. And though amulets and talismans aren’t often seen on forearms and necks, the occasional wizard makes an appearance. “I’ve done, like, 20 wizards a few years ago.” McQuade said, shaking his head. This influx of sorcerers probably coincided with the release of the Harry Potter movies.
Pop culture influences tattoo choices today as well. Many people use their bodies to show their interests, choosing designs ranging from wizards to band names to profiles of Michael Jackson and Bugs Bunny. Pop culture, religion, and loved and lost ones all inspire tattoos. Of course, people get tattoos for more serious and personal reasons as well. First-year music major 
Hannah Roberts has the Greek letters alpha and omega on her wrists. “They are for no particular reason, but I had been thinking about it for a while before I decided to get them,” she said. “I knew I wanted something religious, and I thought through several different ideas before finally ending up with the one I have.”
Roberts confidently acknowledged that she thinks her body art accurately portrays who she is. On the definition of body art, Roberts’ response was similar to McQuade’s: “I think body art is simply decorating your body to express yourself. I don’t think it necessarily refers to tattoos.”
Piercings also have a long and extensive history and symbology, and people today have adapted this form of body art to include gauges, bars, and other types of metalwork. Most people today, especially women, subscribe to this type of body art in the form of ear piercing, although many others have piercings on other body parts as well — nose and navel piercings are also fairly common, and eyebrows, lips, or any other body part that can be subject to piercing can be spotted. Although not as expressive as a picture on a forearm, many claim that piercing is a form of body art as well.
Following this broad definition of body art, body art can also include procedures much less permanent than tattoos and piercings. Hair dyeing is a fairly common, inexpensive, and temporary form of body art. Many people dye their hair typical colors like auburn or blond, but atypical colors like pink and blue can also be a form of self-expression.
Recently, crazy hair colors have been appearing in high fashion and blogger circles. Proenza Schouler, Comme des Garçons, and Chanel have all featured models with pastel and neon hair in their 2010 spring or summer collections. Icy blues and cotton-candy pinks seem to be inspiring designers and fashion followers alike. But whether you follow fashion, are taking a tip from Clementine from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, or have always secretly had a desire for unique and imaginative hair, dyeing is a fun way to experiment with your style and way of expressing yourself.
In spite of its relative popularity, body art is still a subject of contention in society. It is true that piercings and tattoos are very permanent procedures. 
While some people take the use of art on their bodies seriously and plan the meaning behind each procedure, to some it isn’t extremely meaningful at all, and only a new way to add some excitement to their daily look, akin to a bold new haircut.
It has also been argued that unlike a canvas, your body is not a disposable medium, and it should not be treated as such. Many think that art should be saved for paper and pencils, not skin and needles. 
A bad drawing on a piece of paper can be thrown away and a new one can be used in its place — what happens if a tattoo turns out badly, or if your feelings about it change in the next few years, or if you get it for the entirely wrong reasons?
Though this is an argument against permanent body art, it could also be used to support the opposite position. Doesn’t the permanence of the message, whatever it is, heighten the meaning and the experience of it as a whole? Whether a biblical quote or a smiley face, it’s an experience that can’t be erased or thrown away as easily as a piece of paper.
Whether you support the idea of body art or think that art should be reserved for the canvas, at least appreciate people who truly take the time and effort to try to understand who they are and portray it to the world. 
Whether it be neon green hair or a dragonfly on a bicep, understand that someone is purposefully trying to convey something about themselves, and while Daffy Duck may not be the interesting past that Jack London had in mind, it’s definitely a conversation starter.

Last Thursday, Diesel Club Lounge in the South Side hosted a spectacular display of talent. The Three Amigos Tour, which consists of three young, soulful singer-songwriters, has been traveling throughout the eastern states, and this performance marked its Pittsburgh debut. The three performers, along with another talented opening act, provided over two hours of quality music for the 100 or so spectators. Club Diesel itself puts its audience 50 feet from the performers, giving the show an intimate appeal.
The first opening act of Thursday’s concert was Plane Pilot, a keyboard-drum-bass-guitar quartet of 20-somethings. The band’s vocalist and style are reminiscent of Better Than Ezra, with an infusion of blues. “The Sun” was romantic with a strong box guitar sound, while “The After Affair” relied on a piano-driven beat. Their song “Kaleidoscope” could best be described as ’70s piano funk, with the last two minutes of the song devoted to pure guitar and drum solos.
After Plane Pilot came the first of the Three Amigos: Ben Rector. Easily comparable to Jamie Lidell and at times sounding like Caleb Followill, lead singer of the Kings of Leon, Rector is incredibly bluesy. His opening number was “The Feeling,” in which he asked the audience for some help. He explained that the chorus involved repeating the words “the feeling” a few times, and soon enough, he had dozens of singers helping him out. Next up was “Your Heart is a Lonely One,” which placed beautiful words on top of incredibly catchy guitar riffs. The infectious beat kept the crowd moving.
Another of Rector’s songs was “Loving You is Easy,” which had a tropical feel due to the Caribbean-fusion percussion instruments. Rector once again asked for the help of the audience, this time inviting a request for something for him to sing about in his next song. As a result, he ended up singing about Steve Moakler’s hair. Rector closed his set with “Hank,” a beautiful piano ballad written for his young nephew.
Next, Chicago native Andrew Ripp took the stage. Ripp began his set by singing “Peace Like a River,” a charming piano ballad written about his wife. His next song, “Savior,” was written after he performed for soldiers overseas and met with a soldier in Norway named Marty. He humorously explained that the song wasn’t “about them,” but he feels that Marty “might like it.” Another song, titled “The Privileged Life,” was extremely eclectic, evolving from heavy electric guitar riffs and requiring that the audience shout “Hey!” in unison. In a climactic and unexpected ending, Ripp broke out a kazoo.
Ripp incorporated the “Pants on the Ground” song from American Idol into his own set, creating an unforgettable moment. He also chose to end his set with a beautiful piano ballad, this one written for his mother. The song, “Dresden Wine,” was played masterfully; his vocals were flawless and emotional, while his piano was haunting.
Last but most certainly not least was the headlining act, Steve Moakler. Returning to his hometown, Moakler was greeted with enthusiastic fans who sang along to each of his song selections. After arriving on stage eating a banana, he quickly began with the energetic “True Like Your Name,” while singing engaging lyrics like “Love is the worst, you can’t explain / But once you feel it inside, you’re not the same.” Next on the set list was “Where You Belong,” followed by “Stay Sound.”
Moakler explained that the next song, “Boy That You Drew,” was written about a girl that he never met. The lyrics to this song are clever, while Moakler confesses that he’s not like the ideal guy his special someone has been dreaming about. He sings, “There’s no one to blame / Please place the fault on the game / Your heart’s bound to wear different names.”
The next tune, “18,” started out soft, gradually building up to a vivacious ending. Rector, on keyboard, accidentally started the song off on the wrong note. After Moakler restarted the song, Rector smiled and apologized, as they went on to deliver another great performance.
After singing “Happy Birthday” to two members of the audience, Moakler proceeded into a strictly acoustic version of the fan favorite “Run.” Dozens sang along with Moakler, crooning “How many times do you set love free / Before you know it’s supposed to be? / And how long do you wait and see / Before you know to run to me?”
Next on the set list was “Hesitate,” which was actually featured on an episode of Private Practice. One of the song’s verses compares taking a chance to a game of cards: “And I’ve never been a gambling man / But if you want to see my hand / Ask me now and I won’t hesitate.” Following it was “False Alarms” and then “All the Faint Lights,” which was accompanied by vivid blue, green, and red lights flashing on the stage backdrop.
The closing song was “Slo-Mo,” to which the audience sang along for the song’s entirety. Toward the end of the tune, the music stopped and Moakler looked to his other Amigos, asking if they had fun on their tour. After he got satisfying answers from both guys, the music started back up for an exciting and lively finish.
When Moaker left the stage, the crowd almost immediately began chanting for an encore. He promptly and delightfully returned to the stage to deliver two more songs before checking out for the night.
All the artists who played at Diesel weren’t afraid to let loose and have a good time with the crowd. Every one of these men are young, talented, passionate, and will without a doubt see success on the road ahead of them.

“Easy.”
The first word that pushed through her lips is not an accurate description of Joanna Newsom’s latest album. The project includes three discs clocking in at over two full hours of music, with many songs over seven minutes long, from a songwriter who eschews the concept of the refrain like the plague.
So let me take you on a voyage. Four years after Newsom’s Ys, we have abandoned that mythical city consumed by the sea, the doves stuffed with sawdust and diamonds, the exploited dancing bear, and have been given an album focused on love. From start to finish Newsom has created an 18-song tribute to love — expectant or unrequited, magical or pragmatic, just on the verge of beginning or already-ended love.
As an aside, I can’t discuss the emotional consternation I have with trying to accept that much of the beauty and raw love in this album may have been somehow provoked by Saturday Night Live digital-short star Andy Samberg. To me this will likely always remain the greatest mystery of this album.
You should open the package and place the first disc in your music player. If you have a digital edition, start with the first six songs. From the opener through much of the first disc (ignoring the slow and folky “No Provenance”) we are seeing a new Newsom, slightly peppy, often straightforward, with catchy quirky lines (I was repeating “like a bump on a bump on a log, baby” for hours). Both “’81” and “Good Intentions Paving Company” are transformed pop songs passed through a filter of Newsom’s voice and harp. The first disc alone, for many artists, would be an accomplished album. Actually, given the standards of today’s recording industry, the disc’s final track — “Baby Birch” — is more than most artists ever even aim for: a nine-and-a-half-minute song that is truly art. And that is just the first disc.
But here you might need a break. Newsom said this was easy, but you need to give it time, take a nap, wait a day. Have a drink on her. Listen to the first CD a few times, learn the rhythm and patterns in those first six stories before pushing on.
The second disc is more of a mystery to me. It pulls you in fast but really expresses itself on “In California,” where Newsom, in the darkness of the night, turns herself into a cuckoo clock. Everyone has a method for dealing with the uncertainty of love; don’t knock hers. Then you just have three more tracks to pretend to understand before you can move on to the third disc.
The final six songs are risky but rewarding. The start is filled with lawlessness (you will know what I mean); “Esme” and “Autumn” are seductive and caring, and “Kingfisher” is Newsom’s storytelling at its peak. But it is the end that makes this whole thing worth it. The final track, “Does Not Suffice,” is a tear-jerking yet subdued story of the now-ex-girlfriend packing up and moving out. Newsom’s mix of lavishly described clothing being packed compared to the starkness of the empty apartment: “The tap of hangers swaying in the closet / Unburdened hooks and empty drawers / And everywhere I tried to love you / Is yours again and only yours.” This accepted loss followed by an agitated musical outro that is really the best possible ending for this journey. One that pushes you right back in.
The difficulty in enduring a three-disc album is lightened partially by Newsom sticking to somewhat simpler lyrics, though her eccentric touch still lingers: the storytelling in “Baby Birch” (“A tarantula’s mounting Countess Lansfeld’s handsome brassiere, while they all cheer”), the title track explorations (“I roam around the tidy grounds of my dappled sanatorium”), or the obviousness of “her faultlessly etiolated fishbelly-face.” But even with these examples (and trust me, there are more) withstanding, this is Newsom’s most inviting effort yet. Each of these songs has a story, has lyrical and musical constructions that won’t be exposed on the first listen. I have no doubt that this album will in time earn its highly regarded and deserved place in Newsom’s growing canon, but to believe that, you may have to give it days of your time. I can only try to make you believe that it is worth it.
I won’t end with some sort of meta-lecture on how it is possible to transcend the cliche that is the concept album, bucking traditional three-and-a-half-minute songs, and producing something that is musically and artistically rewarding. I won’t do that; I will just mention it so you know it is true and that it is your responsibility as an indie connoisseur, a university hipster, or a harpist to listen to this album (all of it), and when you find it grating, to listen to it again for me. And then one more time — the last one is on her.

This past Wednesday, listeners gathered at Carnegie Music Hall in Oakland to celebrate the work of Carnegie Mellon’s most talented composers. Senior undergraduates and second-year master’s students studying composition unveiled, through music performed by the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic, their original full-orchestra pieces.
The show opened with a piece written by senior composition major Michael Claypool titled “So It Goes.” The piece appropriately alluded to the late Kurt Vonnegut’s 1969 classic Slaughterhouse-Five, in which the novel’s protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, uses the axiom “So it goes” in several distinctive circumstances. The phrase, which appears 116 times within Vonnegut’s book, is one of the author’s most popular lines.
In the concert’s printed program, Claypool wrote, “The piece is meant to be a celebration of life, beginning, appropriately, at death.” He explained how his music not only explores Pilgrim’s understanding of death, but also the different aspects of life that all of us have come to both enjoy and endure.
The piece itself was fast-paced, full of syncopated rhythms and relentless beats. Listeners were able to identify Claypool’s wit within the music, but still distinguish the various imperative messages it contained.
“I enjoyed Claypool’s piece the most,” first-year biology major Shruti Valjee said. “I myself am a huge fan of Vonnegut, and I found the overall eccentricity of the piece to be the most compelling.”
Next, sophomore music major Emma Steele took  the stage to perform Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev’s masterpiece Violin Concerto No. 2 in G minor, Op. 63. Although not a composer, Steele, who won the concerto competition as a first-year last year, easily wowed the audience with her performance.
“I especially liked the third movement because it was exciting and had a lot of rhythm changes,” first-year violin major Clara Treadway said. “I’m sure Emma could have performed ‘Old McDonald’ and I would have loved it. She is such an incredible performer.”
The concert continued with a composition, left unnamed in the concert’s program, put together by second-year graduate student Chad Robinson. Robinson, who received his undergraduate degree in music composition from the University of Houston, created a relatively contemporary piece for his audience that contrasted well with the otherwise more conventional performances of the night.
Senior music major Scott Wasserman’s piece Aoede was the last to be performed. The piece, named after the Greek Muse of song, was inspired by Greek mythology and Wasserman’s own understanding of what it feels like to dream. These influences were most certainly apparent as Wasserman’s music was both whimsical and dreamlike, and the reverie that Wasserman created proved to be the perfect tranquil ending to an otherwise brisk evening.
“This concert was a great opportunity for the composers to have the pieces premiered,” Treadway said. “This was the first time that some of these students got to showcase their self-written pieces.”
Those members of the Carnegie Mellon community who attended this concert were given the opportunity to see the efforts of their fellow students recognized. All in all, the pieces written and performed by these students were not only beautiful, but also extremely inspiring. Surely, when a student body may be motivated by the success of their colleagues, a campus can be expected to feel a sense of triumph.

For those of us who follow fashion, February is a big month. New lines are released, stores stock for the new season, and shoppers begin adjusting their wardrobes for the spring. For fashion enthusiasts in New York City and several other cities, February translates to one thing: fashion week. Fashion week is when fashion designers and brands display their latest seasonal collections in various runway shows throughout the city. Many shows are invite-only and are often flooded by journalists, editors, buyers, stylists, and celebrities alike.
Historically, New York City, London, Milan, and Paris have often been regarded as the major fashion week cities. There are two fashion week seasons that are intended to anticipate trends in advance: From February to March designers showcase their autumn and winter collections, and from September to November their spring and summer collections. These early shows allow buyers and media representatives to preview the looks for the upcoming season and prepare appropriately. Retailers and publications can incorporate the trends into the upcoming months of preparation.
New York Fashion Week
So far, one of the most notable shows has been Marc Jacobs’. Jacobs is the creative director at Louis Vuitton, but he also designs and manages his own line. Throughout the years, Jacobs has consistently presented impressive lines for New York Fashion Week, and this year was no exception. However, peculiarly enough, Jacobs decided to ban celebrities from sitting in the front row of his runway show this year. Considering his past collaborations with Victoria Beckham and Sofia Coppola, this was quite surprising.
Jacobs’ most recent collection can be summarized in two words: pure and simple. He opened his show by tearing down a brown construction paper curtain to reveal his models, who then walked down the runway one by one to a Juliette Greco cover of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” His collection consisted of a neutral palette — including shades of gray, beige, and cream with flashes of sweet yellows. Fur was a key material in Jacobs’ collection, along with tipped Mary Jane shoes and knee-length skirts. Jacobs created pieces for the everyday woman. Joe Zee, creative director of Elle magazine, said in an interview with the Associated Press that Jacobs’ line was made of “gorgeous, real clothes that were beautifully done.”
On another note, it looks like New York Fashion Week will be subject to some change next year. Since 1993 the events have been held at Bryant Park. However, starting next year, New York Fashion Week will be in Damrosch Park at the Lincoln Center Complex.
London Fashion Week
The fashion industry lost a celebrated English designer with the recent death of Alexander McQueen. The death of McQueen, who committed suicide at his London home, seemed to take a toll on the hype and excitement of London’s fashion week. The week’s events opened with a tribute address to McQueen by Sarah Brown, the wife of Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Despite the death of the designer, the label announced that his line will be continued.
One of London’s most impressive runway shows was that of luxury British line Burberry. Burberry’s show featured new technology that allowed people in London to watch the show from the Chelsea College of Art. The live show was simultaneously being streamed around the world, with 3-D showings being played to audiences in New York, Paris, and Los Angeles. The collection is extremely sexy, featuring skin-tight lace and satin body-conscious dresses. Thigh-high leather and snakeskin boots were notable accessories. Burberry’s coats and jackets were eye catching, curling at the collar and reflecting a military influence. This year, London Fashion Week also featured many fresh designers such as Christopher Cane, Marios Schwab, and Louise Goldin. Stella McCartney also debuted her much anticipated collection.
Stay tuned, fashion enthusiasts. There is yet more fashion to come as both Milan Fashion Week and Paris Fashion Week are to debut in March.

“Aurelia, how would you say ‘Stefano has a fever and a stomach ache’?” inquired my Italian professor Janice Vairo during class as we discussed the proper ways to ask for medical care in a foreign land. Nine in the morning always made me sad and flustered.
Why does she always use that name for her examples? So what if I can’t express Stefano’s diagnosis? I had already learned a lot more on my own trip to Italy than the formalities of the language.
I spent three weeks in Padua, just outside of Venice, during the summer of 2008. Despite its distance in my memory, it is still my most leaned-on topic of discussion. Some say that everyone has a moment in life that defines time for them: before 9/11, after the JFK assassination, before their children were born, and so on. For me, I say it was when I went to Italy and lived with nuns and sex slaves.
My high school offered many opportunities for adding to one’s college résumé. One opportunity was the Parkin Fellowship, a selective grant for students who desired to carry out environmental or service projects around the globe. This truly is a wonderful program; it brought me to the most life-changing and mind-altering place I have ever known. Until you live in hiding, until you see hope among the most tormented souls, you can never truly know yourself.
My Parkin Fellowship was a rather unique project. I desired more than anything to work with victims of human trafficking. Having done extensive research on this industry that earns $9 billion annually, an economy overlooked and unnoticed by the American populace, I felt compelled to have my hand in seeing an end to this injustice, or at least bring some happiness to the lives of these tortured young women.
I was scared, petrified even, when I was informed by the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor, who were graciously hosting me, that I would be living in a safe house patrolled on the hour by police officers guaranteeing that the women living there would not be abducted again. All I kept thinking was that Liam Neeson would not be coming to rescue me, that I would be lost in this web of red lights for the rest of my bound-to-be-brief life, if anything were to happen.
But my fear subsided as I entered the tram at the Pittsburgh airport, no longer able to see my mother. I imagined her, Au Bon Pain in hand, frightened, watching her 17-year-old daughter prepare to traverse an ocean to live the life of a foreign prostitute. If a mother can trust her daughter, I should trust myself, I thought.
I had huge plans to change the world. I wanted to patrol the streets at two in the morning, handing out condoms and brochures on STD and AIDS testing. I wanted to counsel the women in the safe house on self-esteem and post-traumatic stress. I wanted to babysit their children and teach them English. I wanted to see every aspect of the legal system that oppressed them and inform the masses of these injustices. I wanted to feed the people who were homeless as a result of this industry. Most of all, I wanted to put faces to the issue and humanize them in my mind. But while I was able to achieve almost all of these — the nuns actually helped me pass out condoms to the street hookers, which was especially incredible considering that strict Catholics object to birth control — I was unable to bring them joy. They had found it themselves.
My education in human trafficking started the instant I exited the plane. Sister Wilma, in her habit so I could find her easily, stood waiting for me in the airport in Venice. She took my luggage, led me to a Volvo, and drove down the highway at hair-raising speeds. The women I would be living with were mostly Nigerian, Wilma told me, taken from their tribes and homes after pimps came into their villages disguised as foreign travelers. These pimps would build trust and offer jobs to the oldest daughters in each home. Nigeria, being a poor nation, is a very easy target for this form of attack, seeing as the families are willing to give up one child in an effort to build financial stability for the rest. Once smuggled into Italy, these supposedly trustworthy men sell the girls to madams for staggering profits, leaving their promises for brighter futures and busying finance in the dust.
It was hard for me not to cry when I met these girls. Knowing the torment they have been through — being beaten by captors, forced to have sex with endless numbers of patrons while starved and sedated — I could not help but feel their happiness was a cover. But they truly were happy people. The more I talked to them, the more I saw that all the hope they needed was in the escape. Even just hearing the girls describe what they had been through brought me to tears. I soon understood that life was only bound to get better for them, that the future was blindingly brighter than their pasts and therefore they rejoiced in the most mundane things.
They bought me a soccer ball, calling me a stupid American for not having brought one with me, and we played in the vineyard for hours. I quickly realized that the maturity I expected from these girls was not there. They longed for the time they missed, clung to me like flies to honey for my youthful exuberance and “normal” childhood. My friendship was all they wanted, not my help or my pity. Through that bond of mutual respect and love, we found a common ground, an understanding, unlike any I have ever known. I saw the other side, and I loved myself more because of it.
I served in a way that is beautiful in its rawest form. I served myself by finding out who I am, by learning the true meaning of hope, by experiencing self-sacrificing love, by putting my life on the line for a cause worth fighting for. I am a new woman, and always will be. And that is one thing that no Italian class can give me. So I may not know how to say Stefano has a headache and needs to see a doctor, but I know a lot more. That has changed my life.

On specialized channels like Oxygen, ABC Family, and BET, the made-for-TV movie makes its comfortable home. Pop culture often mocks the “Lifetime movie” — rife with the same stories about abused women who fight back at the men who are oppressing, suppressing, and repressing them.
Made-for-TV movies are easy targets for criticism; after all, these films are typically low-budget, often starring B-list (or worse) actors who used to sell tabloids but now are lucky if they get any mention at all.
Take I Do... I Did as an example. This movie, released in August 2009 and aired on BET, is so undervalued that it doesn’t even have a Wikipedia page.
The cast of I Do... I Did includes Cherie Johnson, known primarily as Laura’s best friend on ABC’s Family Matters, and Shar Jackson, who played Neicy on UPN’s Moesha. The storyline was quick and the costumes shabby; it seemed as if the actresses and actors had chosen clothing from their own wardrobes.
The story follows the relationship between Marcus, played by Marcus Patrick, and Vivian, played by Johnson, who also wrote and produced the film. On the way to their honeymoon, the couple gets into a serious car accident. Vivian slips into a coma and is incapacitated for two years. Vivian’s best friend Candy, played by Jackson, comes to visit Vivian in the hospital every day, even after Vivian’s own husband stops visiting a year later.
When Vivian finally wakes up, Marcus has gotten remarried. Since Vivian’s family died while she was in the coma, Candy is now all she has. When Vivian finally leaves the hospital, she is forced to wear the wedding dress she was admitted to the ER wearing. The costuming is so bad that the blood on the dress still appears fresh.
Vivian is now forced to move into Marcus’ house with him and his new pregnant wife, Jenny, played by April Scott. At first, Jenny doesn’t seem to care that Vivian is there, but the tension starts to grow as Vivian attempts to show Marcus that this should be her life, not Jenny’s. Marcus now has to try to manage two wives under one roof.
This plot leaves serious issues for nearly any viewer, of course. Marcus was able to remarry without having to produce Vivian’s death certificate and, in the end, Marcus realized he is still in love with Vivian just in time, as luck would have it, for Jenny to fall into a coma.
But TV movies do more than just throw together poorly thought-out plots with barely remembered actors. In 2004, The Prince and Me premiered in theaters to mediocre reviews, although avid Julia Stiles and/or romantic comedy fans will likely list it among their favorites. In 2006, ABC Family took this relatively adorable movie and ran it through the sequel machinery to produce The Prince and Me II: The Royal Wedding. Luke Mably, as Prince Edvard, is the only cast member to return to this low-budget sequel.
In this second installment, moments before Edvard is to marry Paige and take up the throne as king, the Danish Parliament finds an old law requiring that the prince marry a woman of noble blood. As if on cue, Kirsten, a princess who was friends with Edvard when the two were little, comes to visit, and it just so happens that she wants to marry Edvard. He is only too happy to follow through with this plan, until Paige finds a loophole that lets her marry Edvard after all.
Even after the easily forgettable actors and barely memorable scenes were through, there came a third version (cleverly subtitled A Royal Honeymoon), this time shucking Mably in favor of unknown Chris Geere — an only slightly more unimpressive lookalike of Mably, who has yet to find another film to renew his relevance. Even IMDb cannot come up with a better plot synopsis than “King Edvard and Queen Paige set out on their honeymoon.”
What’s even more shocking is that a fourth one is on its way, titled The Prince & Me: The Elephant Adventure. Leave it to made-for-TV movies to wring out every cent of profit from an initially promising concept.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I’ve been Facebook-stalking this cute girl in one of my classes — I know it sounds creepy but, come on, everyone does it. Turns out we have a lot in common. How do I move off Facebook and into real life?
—You have one new friend request
Dear Friend Request,
First, you need to ask yourself one thing: Are you hot? If you are, don’t worry — you’re not a stalker. All you have to do is walk up to her and introduce yourself. Of course, since you’re a guy at Carnegie Mellon, the answer to the previous question is probably no. Don’t try to argue — you know it’s true. Just keep one rule in mind when talking to girls: Don’t be creepy. Just repeat that over and over in your head and maybe take deep slow breaths while you do it.
Here’s the deal — never use some information you found out about her on Facebook. Facebook-stalking is creepy. When you do choose to approach your girl, act as if you’ve never stalked her. Start sitting near her in class and strike up a conversation one day, maybe make a joke about your teacher. Just be yourself — you know you have something in common, and she’ll figure that out too.
Or you could always start actually stalking her. That’s always fun.
Binoculars aren’t just for bird watchers,
—Patrick Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I recently went to a party at the University of Pittsburgh and discovered that all the girls there are way hotter than Carnegie Mellon girls. I feel like I’ve missed out on something big here. What can I do?
—In the Pitts
Dear Pitts,
Your first problem is that you’re a Carnegie Mellon student, and thus, Pitt girls are instantly repulsed by you. The solution: Pretend you’re a Pitt student. Start by taking off your cape and maybe hopping in the shower. If anyone asks, you’re a “communications” major. If you want to pass yourself off as a Pitt kid, you’re gonna have to learn about sports.  
Keep in mind, though, you’re still a Carnegie Mellon student, so you’re still ugly. Don’t try to fly too close to the sun — those Pitt girls will burn you, and I don’t just mean that burning when you pee. Despite all the talk about how hot Pitt girls are, you might find you’ll have more fun and enjoy yourself more with a nice Carnegie Mellon girl. I mean, do you really want a girl whose head is like the Hindenburg — full of hot air?
Or, as suggested before, you could just take up stalking. I hear Point Park has some cuties. 
Put a new swing in your step,
—Brian Hoskins

Music and visual art have always shared a connection, but in this modern age, art and music are meeting on different terms. In the past, it has often been the prerogative of the visual artist to interpret the musician, but today, more musicians are realizing their own visual interpretations. 
Radiohead’s 2009 single “These Are My Twisted Words” was released with a series of images that could be overlaid to produce a variety of different album covers. The Arcade Fire’s music video for their single “Neon Bible” was made completely interactive on the band’s website. Depending on where a person clicked on the page, he or she could interact with the music video character in different ways. 
These combinations of art and music have expanded to large-scale art performances and installations as well. Last year, the BAM Next Wave Festival commissioned Bryce Dessner, Aaron Dessner, and Matthew Ritchie to produce a musical about the dawn of time that would go hand in hand with their gallery of sculptures and images. The performance was radical and the art exploratory. To date, I cannot imagine a more inspiring collaboration of music and art.
On March 4, the realms of music and art will once again blend when Animal Collective opens their new installation and musical performance at Manhattan’s Guggenheim Museum. The project, entitled Transverse Temporal Gyrus, will feature the works of artist Danny Perez and promises to be a stunning blend of sounds and art as well as a truly psychedelic experience. It is one of the most anticipated collaborations between art and music, and with the success of Animal Collective’s recent album, Merriweather Post Pavilion, the show is guaranteed to be spectacular.
These advances in the combination of visual art and music are allowing artists to truly explore the boundaries of their medium. We look forward to seeing future collaborations in this arena.

“How many of you have used HeLa cells in your research?” The soft-spoken voice of Rebecca Skloot fell upon the audience as professionals and students rustled to get a look at those in the audience who responded to the question.
The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a biographical, bioethical account of both writer Rebecca Skloot and the family of Henrietta Lacks, or HeLa. Together they search for answers, answers that concern science and humanity alike. Lacks’ story opens a discussion about the rights of patients and their consent for tissue donation to research.
With these issues in mind, Lacks’ children followed the author into the realm of science for questions left unanswered about their mother and her cells.
“I remember when Deborah [Lacks’ daughter] visited Dr. Christoph Lengauer’s laboratory to see her mother’s cells for the first time,” said the author. Chapter 32 reads, “Christoph reached into the freezer behind him, grabbed another vial of HeLa cells, and held it out to Deborah.... ‘She’s cold,’ Deborah said.... She raised the vial and touched it to her lips. ‘You’re famous,’ she whispered. ‘Just nobody knows it.’ ”
HeLa cells were first extracted in 1951 from Lacks when she came in for cancer treatment at Johns Hopkins Hospital in the “color ward” in payment for free medical consultation. The book cover reads, “Doctors took her cells without asking. Those cells never died.” HeLa is the first human immortal and commercialized cell line. As long as HeLa cells are provided with fundamental nutrients and optimal cell conditions, they will continue to divide an unlimited number of times. “They helped with some of the most important advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization,” reads the prologue of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. 
HeLa travels across mountains, countries, and generations of researchers, even at Carnegie Mellon.
Maggie Braun, assistant department head of the biological sciences department, raised her hand during Skloot’s lecture to discuss the use of HeLa cells.
“I previously worked with [HeLa cells] at the National Institute of Health using them as a control for ‘normal behavior,’ ” said Braun following the event, “we tested them against other cancerous tissues.”
Even the author had conducted research using HeLa cells as an undergraduate biology major. “I was excited every time I looked through the microscope because there she was,” Skloot said.
Skloot began her academic career in biology and in her junior year gravitated towards creative writing. “At the college I attended, creative writing counted as a foreign language so I took that instead of Spanish,” said a chuckling Skloot. The author worked on The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks for 10 years, leaving her master’s work to pursue the book. She later returned to the University of Pittsburgh with a copy of the rough draft. There, she received her MFA in creative non-fiction.
The author spoke to a 200-plus audience in East Baltimore the week before coming to Carnegie Mellon. “They were pissed,” said Skloot, “not at me though.” “Black residents near Hopkins have long believed the hospital was built in a poor black neighborhood for the benefit of scientists — to give them easy access to potential research subjects,” reads Chapter 21. “As soon as they know the family is onboard though, there’s not a resistance [to writing about Lacks],” said the author.
“I think it’s always important to remember the ‘life’ in life sciences,” said associate professor Jay Aronson of the ethics, history, and public policy program. “It’s one of those books that opens your eyes to the hidden human dimension of biomedicine, tissues, and common economic stratification. It takes the lens off America and American medicine.”
Students and faculty stood in line for words with the author following the event.
“I was really moved. It’s embarrassing because I never really thought about where tissues for research come from,” said Kelsey Briggs, a materials science and biomedical engineering sophomore. “I’m interested in learning more about ethics because it addresses all sides of human life.”
The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is available at the Carnegie Mellon Bookstore.

One of Carnegie Mellon’s own professors was a contestant last Friday on NBC’s Jeopardy. Pablo Garcia, an assistant professor in the School of Architecture, was one of the three players on the game show.
After trying out for the game back in 1999 and not advancing to Los Angeles to film the show, Garcia decided to give it another shot a decade later. Currently, much of the application process is online. When Garcia tried out, the application was made up of 50 questions in 50 categories to be answered in only eight minutes. Any of the applicants correctly answering 35 or more questions automatically advanced to the next round in New York.
There, all qualifiers participated in a mock version of the game. According to Garcia, at this level, winning was less important than in other rounds. Instead, it was crucial for producers to observe potential contestants’ interactions with the game. The reasoning for this, Garcia said, is so that producers know a potential contestant’s online test “wasn’t a fluke.”
After competing in New York, Garcia’s next step was to wait. Eventually, Garcia received a call asking him to be in Los Angeles in three weeks to film an episode of the show. Thus, for the next three weeks, Garcia read trivia and watched past Jeopardy episodes in order to learn about the style of questions asked.
Garcia traveled to Culver City, Calif., to appear in an episode of the show. Upon arrival, Garcia was surprised to be taken via shuttle to the Sony Pictures Studio, which, to Garcia, looked very similar to a warehouse. Garcia remarked on the building’s modest exterior, a definite contrast to the Jeopardy stage, which he described as “a very shiny place.” Garcia was also surprised by the size of the video screen that holds the game’s 30 clues. He said that each box is a 30-inch flat-screen TV, which, when six rows of six are stacked on top of each other, created a nicely-sized viewing board.
When it was his turn to compete, Garcia found the pace of play to be very rapid. It took only 40 minutes to film a 22-minute episode, and questions are asked one after the other in a seemingly endless string of miscellaneous trivia.
Garcia described his match as a back-and-forth battle between him and his main competitor, Elizabeth Galoozis, a 27-year-old reference librarian. Garcia’s third competitor, Lisa Dengate, held a score that remained far below those of Garcia and Galoozis. Each time Galoozis fell behind, she would catch back up to Garcia again by acing a Daily Double. Again, after Garcia went on a brief winning streak, Galoozis answered several questions correctly as well. This cycle continued into Final Jeopardy, when, before the last question, Garcia had $11,600 to Galoozis’ $14,000.
In deciding what to make as his final wager, Garcia decided to base it on the category. “If I see British monarchs, I’ll play more defensively. If I see architecture, I’ll play more offensively,” he said.
The Final Jeopardy category was “Artists” and the question: “In 1882, this artist wrote that ‘Though I am often in the depths of misery, there is still calmness, pure harmony, and music inside me.’ ” Garcia’s reasoning relied on the clue “misery,” which led him to the answer of Vincent Van Gogh. Though he got the answer correct, his opponent bet just enough to take the final lead.
By how much? One dollar.
Garcia described the outcome as one based on a game that “is so random” and “luck-filled.”
Apart from the game play, Garcia was surprised to see two sides to the game’s host, Alex Trebek. According to Garcia, while the cameras are rolling, Trebek maintains a serious exterior; however, there’s also a light-hearted man beneath. “Trebek does a great job of entertaining,” Garcia said.
Those who watch Jeopardy may wonder what Trebek talks about during the show’s end credits. 
Garcia, with a straight face, explained that Trebek talked with a contestant about ferrets, as well as began a discussion of the possibility of owning a wolverine.
Cassie Osterman, a first-year architecture major, got together with many fellow architecture majors to watch Garcia, who she described as “riveting,” on the air.
Stephen Lee, professor and head of the School of Architecture, was excited to hear that students joined together to watch their professor, saying that “getting together in a social setting is important to our mental health and fun.” Regarding Garcia’s participation in the non-design event, Lee said: “My agenda is to promote and encourage interdisciplinary education and research … so [Garcia’s participation] was perfect.”

Carnegie Mellon professor of art Bob Bingham, in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon alumni Robin Hewlett and Ally Reeves, has created One Mile Garden, a community initiative in York, Ala. One Mile Garden will provide residents with opportunities for education and better health. The creators will work with locals to establish garden sites and to develop a program for growing healthy food.
One Mile Garden was created in collaboration with the Coleman Center for the Arts in downtown York. Shana Berger, the co-director of the Coleman Center, initially contacted Bingham with the intent of collaborating on a community agriculture program. Berger had viewed Bingham’s website and was impressed by his 2005 “We Grow” project. “We Grow,” based in the Homewood-Brushton neighborhood in Pittsburgh’s East End, is a community-based program that encourages the creative use of vacant land for sustainable agriculture.
Though initially skeptical, Bingham was quickly won over by the prospect of creating a project to address issues such as starvation and unemployment in York. “She enticed me to go to Alabama to do a residency that usually happens throughout the full summer by explaining that it is in one of the poorest counties in the U.S.” Bingham said. “I agreed to propose a project through the STUDIO for Creative Inquiry in Carnegie Mellon’s College of Fine Arts and to spread out a food-growing and -distribution project over two years to allow for research, site visits, community process, growing, and harvesting.” 
The project quickly expanded with Bingham’s inclusion of Carnegie Mellon alumni Hewelett and Reves. “I could not imagine doing it alone, so I found two former students who create art about food to collaborate with,” Bingham said.
Bingham, Hewlett, and Reeves spent a week in York in March 2008 with the hopes of gaining an understanding of the layout of the town’s land. During this visit, they met Catherine Shelton, a self-taught organic gardener. Working with her, the artists established the first large community garden at the Coleman Center. As the project grew, satellite gardens were then established at sites throughout York.
“On Oct. 31, 2009 we planted a 54-fruit-tree orchard in Cherokee Park with the Fruit Tree Planting Foundation from California, with the help of 40 volunteers from the Truevine Fellowship Church across the street,” Bingham said. In addition to the Cherokee Park Orchard, other sites include the town’s Eastern Star Baptist Church and West End Junior High School.
One Mile Garden was featured in an exhibition at the Coleman Center gallery from Sept. 25 to Nov. 13, 2009.
Clara Baron-Hyppolite, a sophomore decision science and psychology double major, said, “I just think it’s really inspirational that a member of our faculty would take the Carnegie Mellon value of combining the arts and practicality to develop the greater good of the community.”
Norlex Belma, a junior musical performance major, echoed Baron-Hyppolite’s approval: “I think it’s great that this is happening. There are many people in our own country that lack the basics needed to survive. As students at a major university, it is our duty to use what we know to benefit the greater community.”
One Mile Garden is significant to Bingham as well, representing many of the values that repeat throughout his work. “We succeeded as artists to establish a program for people to engage in growing their own healthy food in one of the poorest counties in the USA. [This process] will now continue on and serve as a model for other communities.”
Bingham says he will visit once a quarter to check in on the gardens. He hopes to continue developing the project, establishing an artful way to assist people in growing larger amounts of food and combining a process of distributing it within the community.

College is a transition period after which children become adults, but during college, students are caught in an in-between state. They have the intelligence and ambitions of adults, but the imaginations and energies of children. They want to play like children and work like adults simultaneously. This results in students taking to childhood pastimes with childhood purpose while maintaining the focused intensity of a career.
This phenomenon was arguably manifested during the intense opening weekend of a game of Assassins on the Hill.
Assassins is a live-action game in which participants use mock weapons — in this case plastic spoons — to “kill” other players by hitting them in the back or neck. Each player has a target that he or she must assassinate, and after one assassinates the target, one then moves on to the target’s target. This process goes on until there is only one player left alive. As such, at any point in the game, each player has exactly one assassin attempting to kill them and, simultaneously, a second player whom they must assassinate. Players can defend against their own assassins by hitting them with a spoon, which “stuns” the assassin and gives the player immunity for one hour. Some areas, such as classrooms and restrooms, are also considered safe zones where players are not allowed to kill each other.
“By Feb. 20 [the day it started], we had 47 people signed up. The first deadline for killing the first target was Wednesday the 24th. By then, 33 of the 47 people playing had already been assassinated,” said first-year general MCS major Keyan Sadeghi, who is hosting the game. 
Though the game is time-consuming, the rules stress that it is ultimately just a game — making it ideal for college campuses. As of the time of writing, H&SS first-year Christopher Sparks and first-year science and humanities scholar Chelsea Hulse are tied for the most kills at five.
“Getting kills was easy because people post so much stuff on Facebook.... I had no trouble finding an image somewhere of who I was after,” said Sparks. “The circle of friends also matters a lot because there are some people you just can’t avoid.... Trusting them as they trust you is just a less stressful way to go. In return, they can help you spot your target and protect you as needed.”
But for all of Sparks’ preparation and strategy, his assassin, Hulse, actually had little intention of killing him initially.
“At first, [the game] wasn’t something I thought of all the time. On the first day, I was pretty busy, hadn’t read the rules yet ... so I wasn’t really motivated to play,” she explained. “However, when I accidentally let a friend [Sparks] in my building so that he could kill his target, I realized that he was, in fact, my target. I just learned his last name as he walked into the building.”
Sparks stunned Hulse before she could assassinate him, but Hulse was quickly motivated to try again. “I was ready to follow up and get my first kill,” Hulse said.
“On Sunday night, three of my ‘associates’ and I were in my dorm and one of my classmates came in, saying that my next target was back on campus,” said Sparks. “When we went out into the Hamerschlag lounge, my frontman didn’t see my assassin [Hulse] hiding behind the vending machines waiting for me.”
“One thing led to another, and on the night I planned to kill my one target [Sparks], I ended up killing two successive targets as well, getting three kills in one night,” Hulse said.
Currently, Hulse is still “alive” and has accumulated five kills so far. “Now that I’m a key player in the game, I am more motivated to stay in it. We’ll see what happens,” Hulse said. 
With a little more than a quarter of the original participants remaining by the end of the first week, Sadeghi wonders if the game will last the duration of the semester. “Maybe the last people alive will play very carefully,  which might extend the game for a while.”

Lave gets environmental award
On June 24, Carnegie Mellon’s Lester B. Lave will receive the prestigious 2010 Richard Beatty Mellon Environmental Stewardship Award, given by the Air and Waste Management Association. Lave is the Harry B. and James H. Higgins professor of economics. He also acts as the director of Carnegie Mellon’s Green Design Initiative and is the co-director of the university’s Electricity Industry Center.
The Richard Beatty Mellon Environmental Stewardship Award is annually awarded to an individual whose actions have greatly encouraged the betterment of the environment, especially in the control of air pollution and waste management. Lave will accept the award at the Air and Waste Management Association’s annual meeting, held this year in Calgary, Canada.
Lave has accomplished much during his time at Carnegie Mellon, advancing the effort to encourage environmental responsibility.  In 1970, Lave, with his Ph.D. student Eugene Seskin, published a research paper in the journal Science titled “Air Pollution and Human Health.” This paper linked high levels of air pollution with the shortening life spans of people in American cities — a concept which, while angering industries, would eventually revolutionize the environmental responsibilities of corporations. In 1982, Lave was elected to the National Academies Institute of Medicine for his contributions in air quality and health.
Lave earned a bachelor’s degree in economics from Reed College in 1960 and a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University in 1963.
Hendrickson tracks water use
Chris Hendrickson, a Carnegie Mellon professor of civil and environmental engineering, is leading a team of researchers who are studying the amount of water used in the production of various goods such as pet food and sugar. 
The goal of the group’s study is to help industries track and make better management decisions about how they use water during the creation of their products.
Hendrickson, along with civil engineering Ph.D. candidates Michael Blackhurst and Jordi Vidal, has committed to studying industrial water usage with the hopes of discovering the indirect usages of water that are not often reported. 
Hendrickson’s team found that most companies’ consumption of water is hidden because water usage is not measured when used in indirect processes like production. 
In 96 percent of sectors evaluated, indirect uses exceeded direct uses throughout the supply chain.
Through the study, the researchers discovered that it takes almost 270 gallons of water to produce $1 worth of sugar, 140 gallons to make $1 worth of milk, and 200 gallons of water to make $1 worth of cat and dog food.
The team hopes that their results will encourage effective and appropriate water usage in industry.
More information on Henderson and his team’s research can be found at www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2010/February/feb25_hendricksontrackswaterusage.shtml.

Last month, The Daily Princetonian ran a column written by first-year Iulia Neagu arguing that sex after an evening of drinking doesn’t mean a girl was raped, provided she decided willingly to consume alcohol. The opinion piece has garnered some national attention and has remained the most-viewed Princetonian piece for days, accumulating over 300 comments. 
However, we aren’t going to enter the debate as to whether or not the piece is sexist or embark upon an explanation to define sexual consent. Instead, we are going to briefly reflect on the position a university newspaper should take in publishing a knowingly controversial op-ed. Specifically, we believe that controversy can benefit a university community by creating discussion and productive debate about important, relevant issues.
College journalism is, in many ways, hyper-local. The audience of The Tartan is almost entirely composed of the Carnegie Mellon community, a group of about 15,000 people that it aims to support and report to. But even in our small community (by publishing standards), the diversity of opinions is huge. 
We believe it is our responsibility to attempt to canvass and understand the needs of people across the university, realizing that many individuals hold views that may not be accepted by the community. The difficulty lies in helping to present these opinions in a way where they will not be scorned, but published thoughtfully as a beginning of a larger discussion. 
The good that has come out of this is reflected in the current “Most Viewed” list on the Princetonian’s website. While Neagu’s piece maintains a solid first place, two of the other top five articles are well-reasoned responses. The Princetonian has created an environment for public debate, an elusive thing that is often difficult to cultivate, even on a college campus.

With the conclusion of this year’s Lunar Gala came the release of d’Arte, a new online magazine. d’Arte is managed by Carnegie Mellon students and dedicated to fashion, design, and culture.
The Tartan is excited to welcome a new student publication to campus. We believe increasing the published student voice on campus is always valuable. Carnegie Mellon prides itself on diversity, and a diversity of media is essential to this goal. d’Arte will fill a void in terms of opinion geared towards fashion and design at the university, and it will hopefully flourish in this environment. Carnegie Mellon has an outstanding arts program, and d’Arte will be able to mobilize this base for both content and readers.
We are happy to see that d’Arte has been updating its blog through the launch process. The magazine’s editors and designers have done a good job utilizing new media to gain readers, something that is becoming increasingly important in today’s publishing climate.
Moreover, The Tartan is excited to see the sustainable business approach d’Arte has adopted. By going online first, not only have the editors of d’Arte enabled themselves to create a brand before going to paper, but they will also be able to receive valuable feedback to decide if print is the right choice for the publication.
We encourage students and the campus community to check out d’Arte. We hope that this new publication will engage artists, designers, and the rest of the Carnegie Mellon community.
Check out d’Arte's first issue at http://dartemagazine.com.

In high school, when trying to decide which college to attend, I looked at a lot of information about each school I was applying to — the size of the classes, the student-to-faculty ratio, the area around the school, and the majors that the school offered. For me, a school needed to offer a wide variety of majors because I wasn’t altogether sure what I wanted to study, and I wanted to keep my options open.
Colleges and universities that offer a diverse array of majors usually seem more appealing to students, regardless of how large or small each department might be. The state of Pennsylvania, though, seems to think that only some majors are worth having.
A recent Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article states that the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education is considering eliminating many majors at state-owned universities such as Indiana University of Pennsylvania and Lock Haven University. Majors with fewer than 30 graduates over five years will be reviewed.
This means that over 200 majors are currently being examined for potential elimination. The majors being examined at each of the state’s 14 universities vary, but they include majors in departments like chemistry, French, math, German, economics, philosophy, and mass communications, just to name a few.
This change is being proposed in order to save money and cut costs in anticipation of reduced federal and state funding for the universities. Cutting costs may be necessary, but cutting majors is not.
For students who can only afford to attend state-owned schools, this decision will likely provide huge disadvantages. Students may be forced to study things that don’t interest them; they might be forced to attend a school with fewer advantages for them, or one that isn’t such a good fit.
Universities are centers for education. Students should graduate having had a well-rounded education with courses in both the sciences and the humanities. This will provide a better perspective for them — but only if the courses they take are of high quality.
If universities are forced to eliminate certain majors, faculty members from those departments are likely to leave the university. Students will be left without qualified teachers or will be unable to take classes in certain fields, possibly blocking them from finding out what really interests them.
In addition, public universities will lose their competitive advantage over private ones. While state-owned schools are less expensive than private schools, part of their appeal depends upon the diversity they offer, and not just in terms of students.
By taking classes in areas that may be less popular, students broaden their horizons and gain the opportunity to share views with more diverse groups of people. A diversity of classes and ideas is just as important as a diversity of students, and cutting majors that don’t have huge numbers of people in them jeopardizes this diversity.
In the Post-Gazette article, Kenn Marshall, the State System spokesman, said that they were trying to help students where they needed help most, meaning financially. By cutting majors, the universities could avoid raising tuition.
Marshall assumes incorrectly that the state’s priority should be to help students financially at the expense of their educational opportunities. While it is important to keep costs for students as low as possible, sacrificing the quality of the students’ education is not the best way to do this.
Moreover, the state should not be making decisions that are better left to university officials. The state is responsible for the financial aspects of these universities, but the educational side of the university — including decisions about which majors to offer to draw more students to the institution — should be made by school administrators.
With the elimination of so many majors across the board at Pennsylvania-owned universities, it will become more difficult to attract students from out of state or from other countries, decreasing diversity at the schools.
Putting finances ahead of educational quality and diversity may also affect universities’ rankings, which are often important for students and employers, not to mention the universities themselves.
Students who would have otherwise chosen to attend a university in Pennsylvania might decide to attend a school in another state or a private institution, decreasing the amount of money schools get from tuition and fees. 
While there may be fewer students to educate, many of the costs at universities are fixed. For example, the salaries of professors and staff members are unlikely to decrease with a decrease in the number of students, and campus maintenance costs will remain roughly the same as well. This puts the universities in an even worse position financially.
Even putting this aside, though, it is unclear why the state is willing to make sacrifices in higher education even as the federal government is trying to improve primary and secondary education to better prepare students for college.
The federal government has made education a priority, and the state of Pennsylvania should, too. The State System of Higher Education should look elsewhere for places to cut budgets without sacrificing the quality and diversity of education in state-owned universities.
Amanda Cole (acole@) is a senior English major and isn’t sure whether her major would survive the State System’s cuts.

Last month, Blake Robbins, a high-school sophomore in the Lower Merion School District near Philadelphia, accused an administrator of using a webcam on a school-provided laptop to spy on him in his home. Such an act, if true, would violate the trust of the school’s community, not to mention laws concerning legal methods of surveillance. 
We condemn this gross abuse of power and betrayal of trust, one which shows a school administration losing sight of its goal of teaching students and instead focusing on policing them.
Educators have a responsibility to teach, and that includes holding students responsible for their academic actions. But this responsibility does not justify or excuse an invasion of privacy. In an age of increasing surveillance, the home remains a sanctuary. 
Not even national security agencies can spy in a home without a warrant. That school officials are allegedly abusing these powers makes the accusations in the Lower Merion case profoundly disturbing. With its irresponsible conduct, the school district has betrayed the trust placed in it by its students and its community.
Even if Blake Robbins invented his accusations and the defendants are innocent, the case still speaks to an underlying concern of our society. Schools across the country are providing computers with webcams and remote desktop software to their students and faculty. It is likely that this technology is being abused right now — and even if it is not, the fear it instills in students is harmful enough.
With the opportunity for unsupervised surveillance readily available, we must decide as a society where our priorities lie. The response to this webcam scandal shows that Americans still care about their privacy, and The Tartan agrees. Privacy is a fundamental right and should not be invaded, least of all by those we trust to teach future generations.

I just wanted to go to South America. Pure, childlike, wide-eyed wonderment: That’s how I got roped into this.
As a sophomore, I was just emerging from the titanium shell I had been constructing since birth and was beginning to develop and discover my passions. I heard a rumor about a group called Alternative Break going on a service trip to South America, and I wanted in.
After showing up late to the info session in Doherty Hall on a rainy autumn afternoon (I fell asleep), I caught the end of a Q & A and learned that the group was going to work on a bio-marine reserve in Ecuador over spring break. Wow — would there be sloths, I wondered. Would we take pond scum samples?
Regardless, this sounded just up my alley — helping the world in a part of it I’d never seen.
When the meeting ended, I approached one of the leaders, trying to suppress my excitement. The only thing I could think to say was, “Uh, sorry I was late.” I don’t remember who I was talking to, but he smiled warmly and said, “Here’s the sign-in sheet! Did you get an application?”
I applied, was selected, squealed excitedly, hoped there would be sloths, and then told my mother I wouldn’t be home for spring break. 
Today, after returning from Ecuador and leading a trip to Peru, I’m co-president of this organization — an organization that strives to provide students at Carnegie Mellon with the opportunity to serve the world community over break.
Since Alternative Break first appeared at Carnegie Mellon in 2005, students have spent their breaks scattered across the Western Hemisphere. This year, 15 students will be spending spring break at an orphanage in the Dominican Republic.
The service we do is by no means as simple as gathering a group of friends, booking plane tickets, and jetting away. The planning for these trips usually begins in August, though some have been planned as early as 11 months before. Even with all that time, we still manage to run into snags along the way.
As a leader of the organization, I’ve learned volumes about myself (good, bad, and neutral) since that rainy day. One thing I’ve gleaned from the experience is that evolution is essential — we’re still a fairly young organization, growing out of our shoes and trying to find the perfect fit. But isn’t a perfect fit what we’re all striving for in life?

A bill that passed Utah’s state legislature on Thursday, Feb. 18 would charge a woman with murder following a miscarriage. As the bill waits to be finally approved by the governor, there are several important arguments that must be acknowledged so that this legislative motion never becomes a reality.
There is an outstanding question of agency here that is being ignored by the most poignant language of the bill: that women would be punished with up to a life sentence in prison for murder following an “intentional, knowing, or reckless act” without a doctor’s supervision that would lead to the termination of a pregnancy.
Regardless of how responsible a woman is, a murder charge is hardly the answer.
Yes — if you consider an unborn child to be the same as a living, breathing human being, then you might equate actively causing the death of the unborn child to actively causing the death of any other person. But this is not an argument about when life begins. This is a question of agency, and even more an issue of privacy.
Somehow, the issue of an individual woman’s health has been broadcast on the public political stage. 
Unless a person has a uterus and has been faced with either an unplanned, ill-timed, or failed pregnancy, it is impossible to judge what a person finding themselves in any of those three situations should or can do.
Even the term “reckless” is questionable. It is not the same as intentional. It is only the same in that the pregnant woman in question might not have intentionally or actively been protecting her unborn child — not that this is right, but it does not merit life in prison.
Supporters of the bill argue that it will only target women who pursue illegal means of terminating their pregnancies. Abstaining from an argument of whether or not even that would be right, I have to question: If that were true, then why can the bill lead to the prosecution of women who miscarry following a car accident or a beating by an abusive partner?
The sentiments supporting this bill are, then, “part of the cycle of domestic violence,” said Senator Luz Robles, a Democrat from Salt Lake City.
It is true that some women might actively seek a miscarriage rather than consult a doctor for a planned abortion. Some women might not always go about every situation in the most responsible or safest way, especially with an issue as multi-dimensional as a pregnancy, and especially with an unplanned one. But as long as a culture pervades in which no one can talk about unplanned pregnancies, and in which no one can easily come out and admit to an abortion, it is possible that some women might induce a miscarriage of their own means. 
I challenge anybody that is anti-choice to find a significant population of women that have pursued a miscarriage and were at any point satisfied by doing so. Without an open dialogue, these women are alone. They are not malicious; they are simply trapped in incredibly difficult circumstances.
Miscarriages are not something women should ever have to defend themselves for. They’re going through enough — and being put on trial for a terminated pregnancy is barbaric. 
A woman dealing with a miscarriage is experiencing enough emotional and physical pain without dealing with a restrictive and ill-informed legislative body threatening to punish her even more. 
This pain is not to be disregarded, and should not be reduced to simple hormonal reactions or dramatic emotional responses. Her feelings are real. Regardless of a woman’s agency — or lack thereof — in causing her miscarriage, the scar is lasting. Squandering the rights and feelings of women who are trapped in such painful situations by arresting them would most certainly be an irresponsible and backward measure.
What the Utah legislature must take away from the rightful backlash against this proposed law is the indisputable fact that any pregnancy — especially one that ends in an abortion or a miscarriage — is incredibly complicated. It is never a black-and-white issue, and actions leading up to the termination of a pregnancy cannot be easily categorized into actions that should land a woman in jail. As much as Utah’s government wants to see pregnancy as a process with a clear, recognizable, and consistent set of steps, this is simply not reality.
Many advocates of women’s health rights argue that this law would be even less about protecting those who cannot speak for themselves and more about simply punishing women — and I have to agree. 
Until legislation is passed and a general social sentiment is accepted that is primarily shaped by the opinions of women who have faced unplanned pregnancies, abortions, or miscarriages, any negative legislation is and will be indisputably inhumane and malicious.
Women who have faced, are facing, or will face an unplanned pregnancy, a miscarriage, or an abortion, are regular people. 
They have voices, and they have the right to have their opinions heard. Unless their opinions are going to be respected and fully represented in the public sector, legislation ignoring them cannot be justified.
Right now, too many women feel shameful following their experience of any of the above life-changing events — chosen or not — and are silenced, if not by an abusive partner or a horrendously anti-choice state government, then by the unspoken pulses of a society in which issues of morality and mortality are still far too complicated by an overly conservative culture. 
I want those women to be able to speak out. I want them to be free to discuss what they have been through. Never should a woman sit in prison, punished by other human beings for something that only she can understand. 
Actively chosen or not, miscarriages are a personal matter, and the Utah legislative body is acting inhumanely by making them — and the women that have gone through them — a public spectacle.

Despite the revolutionary development in Qatar and the diversity of nationalities there, the fact that there is a bias toward a certain nationality or stereotype cannot be overlooked, especially when this bias conflicts with job and internship opportunities.
Summer break is near, and applications for internships are flooding into huge companies all around the state of Qatar, such as Qatar Petroleum, RasGas, and many more. It is hard not to question how equally each application will be treated and how many exceptions and overlooks will be taken on certain applicants.
It is natural to be attracted toward people with the same nationality, religion, or a certain social stereotype. This bias is ruining the reputation of many well-known companies, which reflects their unacceptable level of unprofessionalism. This issue should be a matter of concern to both students (of all nationalities) and companies who are missing out on a lot of neglected, skillful candidates.
Where does this bias in attitude come from? Since the majority of people in Qatar are expatriates and residents of the country, a policy was put forward to assure future jobs for Qatari youth: “Qatarization.” It is a concept, very well known nowadays, that builds up both a threat and an opportunity for people of different nationalities in Qatar. The certain number of job opportunities in each firm or company reserved for Qataris encourages the companies to lay out a corresponding number of internship opportunities as well. The strategy was feared for the reactions of residents in Qatar and undereducated Qataris as well, but explains an idea toward a better future within the hands of the nation itself.
Questions here are raised: Is this concept of tending to a specific nationality actually a “bias in disguise” under the name of a new future policy? Or is it a plan to assure a future for Qataris who were threatened by being the minority in their own country?
The official Qatarization website states in its mission statement: “The development of the Qatari workforce, through proper education and training, is now a primary national objective designed to enhance the development of the country.”
The workplace, the educational institute, or any other institution must give both the Qatari and international student the same opportunity and experience. But the fact that social factors are put into the equation of success in the fields of work or study is destined and inevitable. It is no myth that people take advantage and “use” their names, their titles, or their nationalities to bring themselves forward to win an exception or simply to be noticed. To what extent should this subjective attitude be considered unjust or offensive? Isn’t equality what we look for in a developed country such as Qatar? Or is the country simply assuring the future of its nation?
The injustice is debatable when it comes to non-Qataris who are working or students who have the internship slot in hand, but it has never been or will be that Qatar would “kick out” someone off their status to give it to another with a more appealing nationality. It is only a matter of concern toward those qualifications that might be misplaced or offended. Of course, it is also unquestionable that Qatar’s market will always need professionals from other nationalities to fill the fields of work that Qatar’s work force is lacking. Yet, students who are on the hunt for internship opportunities will find it difficult to do so if they have a subjective attitude at every path they turn to.
