The men’s tennis team spent its spring break in sunny southern California. The Tartans took on Chapman University, Bowdoin College, Pomona-Pitzer Colleges, and University of the South, finishing with a 2–2 record.
The Tartans started strong by dominating Chapman University 8–1, even with the adjustments the men had to make to play outdoors. Next, the Tartans took on the Bowdoin Polar Bears. The No. 14 ranked Polar Bears defeated the Tartans 7–2.
The first win came from the Tartans’ No. 2 doubles team of senior Jeremy King and first-year Thomas Cooper, winning the pro set in a tiebreaker. The other win came from first-year Christian Heaney-Secord at No. 2 singles, in which he defeated his opponent 7–6 (3), 7–5. Junior Harsha Rao and first-year William Duncan had closely fought matches at No. 3 and No. 4 singles, respectively. They were the last two Tartans on the court as they battled in their third sets.
The men’s team took the court the next day against No. 12 ranked Pomona-Pitzer Colleges and the Tartans fell 6–3 to the Sagehens. The first win came from No. 3 doubles team of Heaney-Secord and first-year Bryce Beisswanger. Duncan and King won their singles matches at No. 4 and No. 5, respectively, to round out the Tartans’ victories. Carnegie Mellon finished the California trip with a 9–0 sweep of University of the South.
The biggest win for the Tartans occurred this past Saturday, when they took on No. 5 ranked North Carolina Wesleyan. The men took a 3–0 lead after doubles; they had wins at No. 1 doubles from tandem of junior Duke Miller and Duncan, at No. 2 doubles from King and Cooper, and at No. 3 doubles from duo Beisswanger and Heaney-Secord.
“We were down double match point but were able to come back and pull the match out. It was a great win,” Heaney-Secord said.
The match came down to the wire in singles play, with only a win from Duncan at No. 4 singles. The match was tied at 4–4. After losing the first set at No. 2 singles, Heaney-Secord took the second set, which pushed the match to a third set. The third set was tightly contested, and Heaney-Secord prevailed 6–4, securing the win for the Tartans. 
“I knew it was on me, and I embraced that opporunity. I just trusted my shots and went big. I was smiling and having fun the whole third set,” Heaney-Secord said.
The Tartans took on the No. 16 ranked University of Mary Washington Eagles on Sunday and won 5–4. The match was delayed, but the men took the lead 2–1 after doubles play with wins from the No. 1 team of Miller and Duncan (8–4) and the No. 3 tandem of Beisswanger and Heaney-Secord (8–5). In singles play, the Tartans had two quick wins from Miller at No. 1 singles and junior Jooho Yu at No. 5 singles. Duncan clinched the match for Carnegie Mellon with a win at No. 3 singles.
The men’s team will take on Washington and Lee University this Saturday at home.

Over spring break, the Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team played in three competitions, defeating three straight-ranked opponents before falling to the defending Division-III champions last week.
The team started its West Coast road trip by defeating Chapman University 9–0.
The duo of seniors Laura Chen and Courtney Chin pulled out a victory 9–7, while first-years Bryn Raschke and Angela Pratt, and sophomore Katie Cecil and first-year Chelsea Motie won 8–3 and 8–1, respectively.
The Tartans also dominated singles with Chen, Motie, Cecil, Pratt, first-year Clare DuBrin, and senior Cze-Ja Tam losing only two sets among their six matches. 
The next opponent on their trip was Pomona-Pitzer Colleges. The Tartans faced strong competition from the No. 9 team in the nation, but pulled out a win of 7–2. Chen and Chin, along with Cecil and Motie, both pulled out doubles victories while Pratt and Raschke struggled to keep up with the tougher competition.
In singles, the women’s team again came out strong as Chen, Cecil, Chin, Pratt, and DuBrin were victorious in their matches; Cecil, Chin, and Pratt won in straight sets. Motie put up a resilient battle pulling even after two sets; however, she dropped the third. The Tartans ended their road trip by sweeping the University of the South 9–0. Chen and Chin, Raschke and Motie, and Cecil and Pratt won doubles. 
In singles, the team stepped up its game with Chen only needing more than two sets to seal her victory. Cecil, Motie, Chin, and Pratt all finished their matches quickly. Tam was particularly dominant, defeating her opponent without losing a single game.
Returning home, the Tartans took on the four-time Division-III champions and current No. 1 overall, Williams College. The Tartans’ winning streak ended here with a loss of 6–3.
The tandem of Motie and Raschke won their match 8–6 while Cecil and Pratt won with 9–8, coming from behind to seal their victory.
The Tartans’ previously dominating singles took a step back this game, with only Cecil pulling out a victory.
After the long, four-game stretch, the Tartans took on the University of Mary Washington Eagles on Sunday and had an 8–1 win.
The Tartans swept doubles, with wins from the No. 1 team of Chen and Chin, No. 2 team of Cecil and Pratt, and No. 3 team of DuBrin and Raschke. Carnegie Mellon continued on to win five out of its six singles matches.
“It was fantastic, baby! The team spirit was really strong today, and everyone was very focused starting from the warm-up and worked to take care of business,” Cecil said.
The women will play Washington and Lee University this Saturday at home. The match start time is still to be announced.

With the 2012 season about to begin, it’s time to evaluate the MLB’s largest division: the National League Central. Last year, the Milwaukee Brewers won the division and the St. Louis Cardinals were the National League wild card, eventually going on to defeat the Texas Rangers in the World Series. With both teams losing their all-star first basemen — Prince Fielder for the Brewers and Albert Pujols for the Cardinals — the division is up for grabs. Let’s look at the NL Central in 2012 with my predictions for how it will finish.
First place, the St. Louis Cardinals
Following their World Series victory, the Cardinals have to cope with the loss of their star slugger, Pujols, and longtime manager, Tony La Russa. However, the Cardinals are getting their superstar starting pitcher Adam Wainwright back — he missed all of last season for Tommy John elbow surgery — and have signed all-star outfielder Carlos Beltran. 
The Cardinals are also a veteran team, so adapting to a new manager should not be a challenge. The Cardinals have a strong lineup now, anchored by Matt Holliday, Lance Berkman, and great front-end starters Chris Carpenter and Wainwright. The question is how well the Cardinals’ bullpen can hold up and how this aging team plays in the field.
Second place, the Cincinnati Reds
While they were a pick to win the division last year, the Reds underperformed with many of their younger players failing to meet expectations. This year, they look to pick up where they left off in 2010 and make a strong playoff push. They did not make any big splashes in free agency, but do have several young prospects — such as catcher Devin Mesoraco — that are expected to make their major league debut sometime in the 2012 season. 
Their addition of starting pitcher Mat Latos by trade from the San Diego Padres is a nice move as well. The Reds’ biggest strengths are their pitching rotation, power bats, and honorable manager Dusty Baker. However, their youth and inexperience makes consistency a challenge. 
Third place, the Milwaukee Brewers
After winning their division last season, the Brewers had a hard off-season, losing Fielder to free agency and dealing with NL MVP Ryan Braun’s performance-enhancing drug scandal and the threat of losing him for 50 games. Thankfully for the Brewers, Braun won his suspension appeal and does not have to miss any games, but they are still going to struggle to replace Fielder both in the lineup and on the field. 
They signed third baseman Aramis Ramirez to improve their defense and to fill the hole in their lineup. They still have a good lineup anchored by Braun and shortstop Corey Hart, as well as great pitching in starter Zack Greinke and closer John Axford, but the back end of the pitching rotation is very weak, and has had trouble staying healthy in the past. 
Fourth place, the Pittsburgh Pirates
Although they were in contention at the all-star break last year, the Pirates finished the 2011 season with their 19th straight losing season. They have a lot of young talent and have tried to add some veteran help. But bad luck was bound to find the Pirates, as their newly acquired starting pitcher A.J. Burnett will now miss serious gametime, having broken an orbital bone after taking a bunted ball to his face. 
Regardless, their success will ride on the ability of their young talent to reach their full potential. If centerfielder Andrew McCutchen and outfielder Garrett Jones can take a big step and produce at a higher offensive level next season, the sky is the limit for this young team. Their top prospects, catcher Ramon Cabrera and pitcher Jameson Taillon, could be potentially good pieces for the future.
Fifth place, the Chicago Cubs
The Cubs have the most embarrassing streak in the major leagues — no World Series wins in 103 years — and this year looks to be no different. As they add a new manager and general manager, this season is definitely more about rebuilding than winning. Shortstop Starlin Castro is expected to build on the great rookie season he had last year, and hopefully turn into a legitimate star. 
The Cubs do not have many strengths, but the team has a few good prospects that may make debuts this year, such as first baseman Anthony Rizzo, who has shown a lot of power in the minors.  Regardless, the Cubs are in for a very long season with little promise of success now or in the near future. 
Sixth place, Houston Astros
As bad as the Cubs may be, the Astros are worse. They are returning just two starting position players from their opening day roster last year: Carlos Lee, who is moving from left field to first base, and centerfielder Jason Bourgeois. The Astros do not have much in the way of young, promising prospects. 
They are moving to the American League West after this upcoming season to balance out the two leagues, so this is the last season the rest of the NL Central can beat up on them. Their biggest strength is their recent sale to new owner Jim Crane. He will hopefully care more about winning than did their last owner and slowly work to turn this team around.

Two weeks of Carnegie Mellon golf have passed and now the Tartans have two tournaments under their belt. The University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships were held March 13–14 at the 72-par Red Tail Golf Course in Sorrento, Fla. 
The Tartans placed third at this event, scoring 308 in the first round and 310 in the last for a total score of 618. Emory University took first scoring at 581, University of Rochester finished second with a score of 586, and New York University took fourth by scoring 637.
Sophomore Grant Strimel and senior Terence Einhorn tied for 10th in the tournament with 36-hole scores of 153. Strimel’s second round was seven strokes better than his first. 
Both Strimel and Einhorn earned All-UAA second team honors. This is the third-straight season Einhorn has been honored with All-UAA: As a sophomore, Einhorn achieved first-team honors.
“I really worked hard on my swing in the offseason and was ready to hit shots when I got down [to the Red Tail Golf Course]. I had control over the ball, but my putter was just ice cold until the final day,” Einhorn said.
Senior Michael Cheng finished at 155 with scores of 77 and 78. Sophomore Ian Bangor scored 79 on both days to finish with a score of 158.
First-year Justin Fischler ended his play with a score of 161.
“We only had a few practice rounds to make sure that everything we worked on during the winter transferred over to the actual course. With a little more time, I think we would have played better,” said sophomore Matt Wilson.
The Tartans competed in the 2012 Jekyll Island Invitational from March 16–18. In the three-day, 54-hole event, the Tartans finished 26th out of 30 with a team score of 938 (304, 326, 308). 
Einhorn finished the tournament with a score of 226, shooting his best round on the third day with a score of 72. 
Cheng shot 230, and Bangor finished at 240. Strimel had a setback with a score of 250 in this tournament, and first-year Derek Cobb scored the same. 
“We did not play our best in both tournaments, but we showed signs of potential heading into our next couple of tournaments,” Cheng said. “We had some good rounds shot by our team.”
The Tartans compete again this Monday in the Titan Spring Invitational hosted by Westminster College.

“This is the nicest first day of outdoor season we have ever had,” said head coach Dario Donatelli when the men’s track and field team gathered for its first practice this season. Having just finished Indoor University Athletic Association (UAA) with a tie for second place, the Tartans were ready to begin outdoors, with the post-spring break weather in their favor.
The men’s track and field team traveled south to Lexington, Va. for its first meet of the outdoor season this past weekend at the VMI-W&L Track and Field Carnival, hosted annually by Washington and Lee University. There, they were again greeted by warm weather and pleasant competition conditions for nearly the entire duration of the two-day meet. 
Working as a team, sophomore Mike Standish, junior Benjamin Nealy, first-year Thomas Vandenberg, and junior Noel Titus ran the 4x400 meter relay race on Friday, finishing strong in fourth place with a time of 3:21.85. Vandenberg also competed in the 800-meter run the next day, finishing with a time of 1:58.33. Sophomore Joshua Newby came in second overall in the 5,000-meter run in 15:03.89. 
In the field events, many Carnegie Mellon athletes made strong marks. Sophomore Nathan Cheek placed seventh in the shot put, throwing 13.36 meters. Sophomore Zachary Erra-Hernandez threw the shot put a distance of 14.92 meters, earning an overall first place title in the event. He also placed sixth in the discus, as well as eighth in the hammer throw.
“I’m hoping to build off of all the practices, as well as from the indoor season, to get better each time during outdoors,” Erra-Hernandez said.
In the pole vault, junior Daniel Cardenas Rivero finished second after clearing a height of 4.10 meters, his career best. Competing in his first outdoor season, first-year Michael McDermott placed sixth in the pole vault, as well as third overall in the high jump with a height of 1.90 meters. Senior Ryan Kissell placed sixth in the long jump with a distance of 6.56 meters. He also came in third in the triple jump, clearing 12.94 meters. 
The men’s track and field team will continue to utilize the rare good weather for practice. They will be competing this Friday and Saturday at Washington and Jefferson University.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s club lacrosse team played two games last week. The first was against the John Carroll University Blue Streaks in University Heights, Ohio. The Tartans fell in this game with a close score of 9–8.
This game was tightly contested with strong defensive efforts from both teams. The Tartans’ junior goalie Spencer Rice posted an impressive 47.1 save percentage, but his number was bested by the Blue Streaks’ goalie’s save percentage of 61.9 percent. Sophomore midfielder Spencer Lehr led the Tartans’ offense with four goals.
The team also competed against the Walsh University Cavaliers last Saturday at Gesling Stadium. The closely fought match ended with a Tartan defeat, losing with a score of 20–15. The Tartans are now 1–4 overall, 0–3 in conference.
The Tartans’ lacrosse team lacked defense in this match, giving up 20 goals. Prior to the game against Walsh University, their season high for goals allowed was 13. The game raised their season average of goals against from eight to 10.4.
Carnegie Mellon’s offense was strong throughout the match. Although they lost, the Tartans put 15 past the Cavaliers’ goalie, matching their season high. This offensive frenzy contrasts the strong defensive game earlier in the week.
“We played well. We were up against a solid team with a very strong offense,” said junior midfielder Jimmy Komianos, who scored one goal on Saturday. “For our upcoming road trip, we can improve on keeping the game speed up throughout the entire game, as we got a bit complacent in the second quarter and we fell behind.”
The Carnegie Mellon men’s club lacrosse team is led by head coach Andrew Dickson, who has been in the position since 2007. The team’s assistant coach is Robert Heaps. As part of the Central Collegiate Lacrosse Association, the club lacrosse team plays under the Men’s Collegiate Lacrosse Association (MCLA) subdivision. All the rules of the MCLA are in line with those set forth by the NCAA. The team practices once or twice a week on either the soccer field or at Gesling Stadium.
The Tartans will be back on the field this Friday against the U.S. Coast Guard Academy (4–3, 1–1) in Connecticut. This game will be the first of a five-game road trip before the Tartans return home for their final game of the season against the University of Pittsburgh Panthers.

The good news is that the “Freshman 15” is an exaggeration; the average weight gain among first-years is only about 4 1/2 pounds, according to a study by Brown University researcher Elizabeth Lloyd-Richardson. 
The bad news is that gradual weight gain throughout college is becoming a problem, according to an article on www.CBS.com.
However, a recent study shows that a form of therapy currently used on diabetes patients may be able to promote weight loss by reducing a person’s food intake. The study was led by Jenny Tong, an assistant professor at the University of Cincinnati, and Darleen Sandoval, Tong’s research assistant. This therapy is used to reduce glucose in the bloodstream of diabetes patients and has been found to be as effective as FDA-approved treatments for obesity.
The secret is in the release of a hormone known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in a person’s body whenever he or she eats. According to Dr. James Norman, parathyroid surgeon and founder of the medical information website EndocrineWeb, GLP-1 is a special type of hormone — an incretin — that increases the amount of insulin in a person’s body. Norman describes insulin as a referee for how the body uses fat: The insulin slows down the burning of fat into energy, thereby prolonging the time a person can last without eating again.
Tong and Sandoval’s study found that by increasing the amount of GLP-1 in the body, a person’s food intake decreases. In a study among males of healthy weight, GLP-1 caused them to reduce their food intake by 12 percent and feel more satiated than a separate group of males who were given a placebo.
When asked about the possibility of GLP-1 therapy being used by Carnegie Mellon students, senior chemical engineering and biomedical engineering double major Jia Jia Zhang said, “I personally wouldn’t do it. Although the idea of eating less is appealing, I don’t think most CMU kids eat for the sake of eating, but rather to de-stress.” Zhang added that Carnegie Mellon students are also smart enough to turn down the guinea pig position of testing out an experimental therapy.
Scientists still have much to learn about the success of GLP-1 in combating obesity before it becomes available to the public. The weight loss effects of GLP-1 have only been observed in a six-week study on patients with Type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the results cannot be generalized across a population of people without diabetes.
The GLP-1 therapy does have some known negative side effects, the most frequently reported being nausea. Furthermore, the results of an internal application of GLP-1 via injection have yet to be thoroughly analyzed.
If the increase of GLP-1 content in the body is actually capable of decreasing food intake in patients without diabetes, then the health and cosmetic industries may have found a gem. With additional research, the discovery of GLP-1 therapy as a weight loss method has the potential to put over-the-counter diet pills out of business. However, the therapy will not be aiding college students any time soon.

People often complain about the inevitable wrinkles, body aches, and memory loss that accompany old age. Many scientists believe that DNA and proteins play important roles in the aging process. That’s no exception at Carnegie Mellon, where researchers are exploring the Sirtuin family of proteins, hoping to understand how this protein could impact aging. The research has provided significant insight into ways of possibly increasing mammalian and human life expectancy.
In the past century, life expectancy has increased significantly due to improvements in hygiene, drugs, and medical technologies. These improvements help the elderly better cope with the complications that come from old age, many of which could be the result of one’s DNA and proteins. DNA is comprised of genes, which act as instructions to make the proteins that our bodies use to carry out daily functions. As humans age, gene expression may drop.
Biology graduate student Guy Zinman and associate professor Ziv Bar-Joseph have been working with molecular biologist Haim Cohen of Bar-Ilan University in Israel to study genes that code for a particular class of proteins known as Sirtuin.
Sirtuin proteins have interested researchers in the past decade because of their possible ties to longevity. Over the past few years, projects considering Sirutin proteins have gained popularity. In August 2011, The New York Times reported the development of a drug involving Sirutin by the National Institute of Aging that helped obese mice live longer.
This past month in the journal Nature, Cohen and his team published their work exploring a specific Sirtuin known as SIRT6 and its impact on longevity in mice.
Back in 2006, Cohen and his team were the first to begin their research on SIRT6 by removing it from the DNA in the mice they tested. These experimental mice became very sick due to various health problems and died at very young ages. This increased the interest in SIRT6, so Cohen and his team in Israel wondered what would happen if they increased the concentration of SIRT6 in mice.
Zinman explained that “on average, the life expectancy of these mice increased by almost 15 percent.” With these results, Cohen and Zinman’s group tried to understand why these mice were living longer than normal mice.
In cells, proteins can induce a chain reaction — the production of one protein can make the cell produce another protein, which then activates the production of another protein. The group’s research concluded that SIRT6 acts in a similar manner by activating the production of another set of proteins. Sirtuin activates the production of many other proteins that can reduce the creation of cholesterol, a fatty substance that clogs arteries and restricts blood circulation, thus preventing heart problems.
It would be a daunting task for researchers to examine the hundred or so proteins that are affected by Sirtuin’s influence. To get around this obstacle, Zinman and Bar-Joseph worked with Cohen’s team in Israel using computational techniques that combined their results with data from other projects. From this, they produced maps that allowed the researchers to understand the activity of proteins in the cell.
However, Zinman found it very difficult to navigate the 30,000 different projects to obtain the information his team needed. “It was very unclear what types of projects developed that data,” he said. “Almost half a billion dollars worth of data stored online was practically unusable.” For researchers to successfully analyze a protein’s effects, they need to be able to compare their data to other data collected around the world.
Faced with this challenge, Zinman, Bar-Joseph, and a team of computational biologists at Carnegie Mellon attempted to find a way for researchers to utilize all this information. Together, they developed a tool called Expression Blast that acts as a protein data search engine for researchers. It allows scientists to input search queries about a protein or gene, and retrieve more information about it from various prior experiments.
“The most impressive aspect of Expression Blast is that it can compare results cross-species, a feature that similar tools in the past have not been able to do,” Zinman explained. This allows the tool to play an integral role in drug development, since most drugs are first developed and tested on mice even though the eventual target is humans. By using Expression Blast, “researchers will be able to predict if it’s going to work on humans,” Zinman said.
With the emergence of data on Sirtuin proteins proving their ties to aging and to the development of tools such as Expression Blast, scientists are now one step closer to determining a concrete way to prolong longevity.
“One day we will be able to develop drugs that could allow humans to live healthier lives and possibly enjoy a longer lifespan,” Zinman said.

The spring season brings blooming flowers, pleasant breezes, clear skies, and, unfortunately, allergies. Just thinking of allergies might induce mental pictures of stuffy noses, watery eyes, and sneezing. Usually, people will take a variety of medications for treating allergies, including steroids and allergy shots. One of the first medications typically given is an antihistamine, which works by blocking the effects of an immune system chemical in our bodies, fittingly called histamine.
Histamine is a molecule released in the immune system that leads to symptoms such as itching and runny nose. In general, when a person’s body comes in contact with an allergy trigger like pollen or ragweed, immune system cells called mast cells produce histamines. These molecules interact with receptors within the nose and throat, causing common allergy symptoms. They can also cause hives to form on the skin.
When any part of the body comes in contact with an allergy trigger, the body produces antibodies, which then interact with the histamine-producing mast cells. As a result, histamines are released and bind to special sites called receptors on cells in the nose and throat. 
This interaction causes blood vessels to widen, which allows more blood to flow to the area where the interaction is taking place. It can also cause swelling, fluid leakage, and itching in the nose and eyes.
Antihistamines block the interaction of histamines with their receptors in the nose and throat, thus suppressing both the swelling and the widening of blood vessels. 
The medications commonly achieve this by coating the receptors, preventing them from recognizing the histamines.
There are two general types of antihistamines. Sedating antihistamines can enter the brain and cause drowsiness. The most recently developed antihistamines, called non-sedating antihistamines, cannot enter the brain and therefore do not cause drowsiness. The sedating antihistamines are more commonly used since itching tends to worsen in the evening and the medicine can help the user fall asleep.
Once released by the immune system, histamines work very quickly. In fact, according to Discovery Health, “By the time your symptoms appear, the histamine has already attached to cell receptors, and the allergic reaction is well under way. That’s why you need to take antihistamines two to five hours before exposure to allergens.” This is because antihistamines generally work well only 15 to 30 minutes after they are taken and are most effective one to two hours after they are consumed.
Although antihistamines can be effective in preventing allergy symptoms, they also have a wide array of side effects such as drowsiness, headaches, blurred vision, and constipation. Moreover, antihistamines can interact with other medications and cause further problems, and therefore need to be taken with caution. 
According to the health website NetDoctor.co.uk, “Drinking alcohol with a sedating antihistamine can increase the drowsiness it causes and should be avoided. Also beware of a ‘hangover’ effect in the morning if the tablets are taken too late at night.”

Instead of using seeds or flowers to reproduce, ferns replicate by dispersing spores into the air. Using a high speed camera, scientists from the University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis and the National Center for Scientific Research in France were able to study the catapulting mechanism that ferns use to scatter their spores.
Spores are released from an initially curled structure located under the leaf called the annulus. The scientists observed that the annulus unfurled itself and released the spores in a snapping motion that occurred at two different speeds. The initial part of the snap proceeded very quickly, in microseconds, and then proceeded to slow down by 1,000 times to fling the spore out of the fern.

Within days of the latest iPad release, Apple announced that 3 million units have already been sold, in what Philip Schiller, senior vice president for worldwide marketing, called “the strongest iPad launch yet.” Apple has sold 10 times as many iPad 3s on the first day of sale as those sold at the original iPad’s launch. 
The latest version of the device has improvements in display, wireless connectivity, and processing power. The company has enjoyed similar success with other products, such as the iPhone 4S, which had 1 million units sold within 24 hours of opening weekend sales.

A new study from Western Illinois University found a direct relationship between Facebook usage and socially disruptive forms of narcissism. In the study, researchers examined the Facebook activities of 294 users between the ages of 18 and 65, who were rated for displays of grandiose exhibitionism (GE) and entitlement/exploitativeness (EE). 
Results found that the higher people scored for GE, the more friends they had on Facebook. The study also found that those who scored high for both EE and GE were more likely to accept friend requests from strangers.

Researchers from the National Institutes of Health found that women whose bodies had high concentrations of a benzophenone compound were more likely to be diagnosed with endometriosis than those who had lower concentrations. 
Benzophenones are a common compound in sunscreens that have recently been connected to endometriosis, a condition where the uterus lining grows into other types of tissues. This condition often results in pain and infertility in women, and has long been linked to estrogen levels in the body. While benzophenones have been known to mimic estrogen signaling, their connection to endometriosis was not discovered until recently.

A recent paper from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology revealed the ability to separate cell types without additional processing of the cells. In typical magnetic sorting devices, cell surfaces must be attached with magnetic particles beforehand, a process that costs both time and money.
In the new microfluidic technique, the labeling process was eliminated by incorporating cells directly into a nontoxic magnetic salt solution. As the cells flowed by a magnet placed in the device, they experienced different magnetic forces based on their size, and became separated based on their mass.

James Cameron, known for directing Hollywood blockbusters such as Titanic and Avatar, announced a plan to film his descent to the Mariana Trench. At 10,994 meters below the Pacific, the Mariana Trench is the deepest area known on Earth and has not been explored in a manned vehicle since a 1960 expedition by Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh. 
In addition to filming his journey into the depths of the ocean, Cameron intends to collect sediment samples and creatures for further study.

The Miller Gallery is currently featuring the work of seven Carnegie Mellon Master of Fine Arts students in the exhibition The You Inside of Me. After three years of study at the School of Art, the artists — Jonathan Armistead, Agnes Bolt, Sung Rok Choi, Jesse England, Riley Harmon, Oscar Peters, and Nina Sarnelle — are presenting their final theses in the exhibit, which opened last Friday.
The first floor of the gallery features work by Sarnelle, who “makes fantasies, miracles and lies ... [whose] performances explore the physicality of metaphysics and the malleability of belief,” as described in her artist’s statement. Sarnelle’s featured work tells the story of a social experiment in relationships that she conducted over the last year.
She mailed 400 letters to people living near her home. Each letter began, “Dear Soon to be Old Friend, I am interested in inventing the narrative of our relationship. This story may not have existed before but will most certainly exist from now on.” Sarnelle’s experiment resulted in the formation of friendships based on an improvised non-reality. “I really enjoy getting lost in something and not knowing what’s real anymore,” she explained.
Sarnelle’s art is different from what people visiting the gallery may initially expect, as her chosen medium for this particular project was not painting, drawing, or sculpture. Instead, she worked through people, building fictional relationships that have developed into real relationships that continue to flourish today. In this way, her work is among the most interesting of the exhibition.
Choi, Peters, and Bolt’s artwork is featured on the second floor of the gallery. Stepping out of the elevator, visitors are immediately struck by the enormousness of Peters’ work, which takes up the central area and includes a six-foot, 300-pound model of the moon that is situated on a circular wooden track. In the center of the track, a large green lion’s head sits atop a spar, and three red banshee heads, which appear to be silently screaming, hang from the ceiling. If the sheer size and aesthetics of Peters’ piece — which he described in his artist statement as “halfway between Sisyphus and Indiana Jones” — aren’t interesting enough, the piece is also mechanized so that the banshee heads move and the moon rolls around the track.
“I love Oscar’s piece. I like the physicality of it,” said Sarah Keeling, a sophomore art major. “It’s like a lot of his other work in that it’s really physical and you don’t know if it’s going to be dangerous or not.”
While Peters’ piece was certainly entertaining to observe, it lacked cohesion. For the art observer who tries to connect the dots between the swaying banshee heads, the lion, and the moon in order to derive meaning, the piece disappoints.
On the left side of the room is Choi’s project — a watercolor animation series titled “Operation Mole.” His animations show a capsule-shaped time machine and its driver tunneling into the earth amid images of human carnage, war, pop culture, and political events. The work is loosely based on events from Korean history, but also draws inspiration from comics, science fiction, and dark humor to create what Choi called “a kind of ridiculous, absurd landscape.” His work in this exhibit is aesthetically impressive and thought provoking.
Students who attended the opening expressed an appreciation of the balance that Choi and the others were able to strike between seriousness and fun.
“I like that everything I’ve seen so far is a little bit silly,” said Reese Adams-Romagnoli, a first-year art student. “I think that’s really the way to go. I was expecting something more serious, but I was pleasantly surprised. I can see that a lot of thought has been put into what these artists produce, and I appreciate the mental stretching that it took to create things that are both fun and valid at the same time.”
Bolt’s work occupies the right side of the second-floor space. Her piece “I’m Only Now” centers around what appears to be a stripper pole, which spectators can hold onto while a platform beneath their feet rotates around it.
Bolt explained that when spectators opt to take part, her project can be experienced in one of two ways. If the pole is perceived as a prop for a stripper, taking part will result in a “low experience.” Conversely, whirling around the pole can also be something very spiritual. “There is a suggestion of time being both present and kind of eternal,” she said. “The point [of the experience] is to use your body to see what you believe. You make it what you want it to be. You can get something more from the experience — this feeling that you’ll live forever.”
On the third floor of the gallery, England’s work includes custom-built gadgets, books, and cameras that are meant to engage viewers in the issues surrounding contemporary image consumption. “Technology has made it very easy for us to share media, but it is also very easy for us to lose that media,” England said. “I take impermanent things and make them permanent.”
England constructed a video-sharing mechanism, made from a wooden box and mounted on the gallery wall, as a parody of YouTube. The piece, complete with a view counter and pad of paper for viewer comments, is quite amusing, but it also raises a serious question about accessibility. Is ease of access more valuable than having media and information physically in our hands? England’s work feels very relevant to the issues our current generation faces.
Also on display is a camcorder that has been manipulated to function like its more primitive predecessors. Pieces of wood have been screwed to the camera’s frame to eliminate higher-tech features. Additionally, England has produced a physical back-up for his e-book copy of George Orwell’s 1984, as well as pamphlets that teach one how to mimic popular typefaces.
Armistead’s art — a large, pink, fountain-like structure made from office chairs, lotion bottles, and tissue boxes, all of which are held together by a metal frame — takes up the center space. White liquid flows from the lotion bottles into bowls that sit on the seats of the office chairs, while tissues fan out from the tops of the tissue boxes.
Armistead aims to “highlight an often dormant sexuality that exists within our everyday,” according to his artist’s statement. He said that his sculpture, titled “Reach Out and Touch No One,” reveals the importance of the office chair as a prop in people’s sexual lives.
“Every time I see an office chair in someone’s house, I think about how often they masturbate on it. I see an office chair, and I see sex,” Armistead said, pointing out that the majority of porn circulation takes place through the internet and that people in long-distance relationships can now engage in “Skype sex.”
“Also, these chairs represent the body because they are ergonomically designed to fit the body,” he continued. Armistead’s fountain of lotion and chairs is comical, disturbing, and effective. It successfully approaches a socially taboo topic without pushing viewers away, and simultaneously maintains the important element of visual appeal. “I really like the armchair piece,” said Katie O’Conner, a first-year art major. “I like that the aesthetics hide the technological parts of it — the pipes and tubes.”
To the right of Armistead’s work, Harmon presents a series of three videos. Though created separately, the videos share certain elements, including guns, performances, and the space inside of a vehicle. The videos coincide in a way that blurs the line between past and present, fantasy and reality.
Along with the three videos he created, Harmon also displays pictures of people imitating a popular scene from the movie I Am Legend that he found on the internet. The pictures all feature individuals curled up in their bathtubs with a gun and something else they value, most often a pet.
For the opening of the exhibition, Harmon also had a live musician who resembled Ryan Gosling playing guitar. This coincided with Harmon’s integration of scenes from the movie Drive, which features Gosling, into one of his three videos. The discreet way in which the pieces of Harmon’s piece come together sets it apart from the other projects.
Commenting on Harmon’s piece, Talia Levin, a first-year Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student in creative writing and drama, said, “I like it, because I feel like you can draw your own conclusions from it. It’s a lot to take in but not so much that it’s unreachable, or that I felt detached. The message isn’t shoved down your throat, but it’s also not so abstract that you can’t get it.”
Together, the seven artists have put together a memorable exhibit that explores a variety of topics — from masturbation to technology — through a variety of mediums.
The exhibition will remain open to the public through April 22. The Miller Gallery is located in the Purnell Center for the Arts.

“I <3 FEMALE ORGASM” was prominently displayed on several students’ T-shirts last week. These T-shirts were not solely intended to be provocative or racy, but were also a walking advertisement for the much anticipated “I <3 Female Orgasm” program. Presented by Ms. CMU — a newly formed student organization focused on women’s rights — and the Peer Health Advocates, the presentation featured sex educators Rachel Dart and Marshall Miller, who talked about every Carnegie Mellon student’s primary concern: the female orgasm.
The lecture in Doherty Hall was completely packed last Thursday, with students sitting in the aisles and on the floor in front of the first row. The speakers started off the program by showing the famous “I’ll have what she’s having” scene from When Harry Met Sally. Students were roaring with laughter, which was exactly Dart and Miller’s intention, as they said the topic of female orgasm should be something fun to talk about — not something serious or awkward.
The presentation was interactive: The speakers invited audience members to share what they already knew about the female orgasm. Dart and Miller would then address each piece of knowledge by either clarifying it as a myth or expanding upon it. This flexibility gave the presentation a natural flow that was more comfortable than if the speakers lectured straight to the audience. Miller was particularly hilarious, comparing poor sex education in high schools to a driver’s education class that only teaches you how to put on your seat belt and not actually how to drive the car.
Mainly females attended the presentation, but there was a good number of males present. One of the male attendees, Nick Zuniga, a sophomore biology and psychology double major, said that he attended because he “just wanted to find out more about how the female body works ... how to better help my girlfriend.”
The publicity for the event made sure to stress that this was a program for all genders and sexual orientations. The speakers did a good job of addressing the topic from multiple perspectives; the program never seemed like it was focused solely on heterosexual relationships and intercourse. Dart and Miller also addressed more serious concerns such as sexual abuse, providing resources available to students who may be affected by such issues.
About halfway through the program, the audience was divided up by gender and sexual orientation: Females stayed in the hall while males moved to another room with Miller, and a small group of those who did not want to be sorted by gender went to another room. Once isolated from the males, the females felt more comfortable openly discussing topics such as masturbation and its stigma, first orgasms, and how to better achieve orgasm. The format was an open forum, with audience members raising their hands and sharing their stories in a confidential, nonjudgmental environment.
The entire audience then reconvened in the original lecture hall, where the speakers finished their presentation by further discussing the female body and answering questions along the way. At one point, audience member Anya Weitzman, a senior Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student in art and anthropology, offered to clarify the answer to a question a male student asked regarding the clitoris, citing her Body Politics class as the source of her knowledge.
The audience was enthusiastic about the presentation and discussion. At the end of the program, students rose and gave the speakers a standing ovation for an entertaining and informative session.

“Carnegie Mellon University’s largest student-run fundraising event,” boasted the program for Greek Sing 2012. With over 1,000 participants from the Greek community representing 17 different chapters, the event managed to raise over $55,000 for The Children’s Institute of Pittsburgh. The philanthropy award, given to the house that raised the most money on its own, was awarded to Delta Gamma for raising over $8,000.
The Greek Sing chairs — Jake Yosafat, a senior business administration and ethics, history, and public policy double major in Alpha Pi Epsilon, and Harold Kim, a senior information systems and human-computer interaction double major in Sigma Alpha Epsilon — also served as the masters of ceremonies for the evening’s festivities. Both have served as the Greek Sing chairs of their individual houses, and Yosafat saw the opportunity as “one last final way to give back to the Greek community,” with Kim echoing his sentiments.
Yosafat and Kim aided in moving the show along with witty banter between performances that kept the audience laughing. Laughter was a big part of the show as a whole: Most groups used slapstick and lowbrow humor, which the audience responded well to. The first competitive performance, Beta Theta Pi, embodied this spirit and took the time to make fun of itself, showcasing the good-hearted spirit of the event and reminding audience members that the show is about giving back to the community. Similar to Beta Theta Pi’s seven-foot man in drag, Delta Delta Delta and Lambda Phi Epsilon had a cast member don an afro larger than his head that covered his entire face. This exaggerated humor was a big theme, and helped keep the entire event engaging.
The event had eight judges, all professionals chosen from the Carnegie Mellon community, including housefellows, professors, and program directors. Although the audience had no interaction with the judges, a description of each judge was included in the program along with fun facts such as computer science professor David Kosbie’s “near-perfect lack of pitch.”
The competition was broken into two acts: singles performances and doubles performances. After over two hours of competition and a video on The Children’s Institute of Pittsburgh, the scores were finally tallied. Kim and Yosafat awarded two Chairmen’s Choice Awards, an award for the houses they deemed the easiest to work with and that helped the event run smoothly. This year’s recipients were Delta Delta Delta and Kappa Kappa Gamma.
After much anticipation, awards were presented starting with singles third-place winner Alpha Kappa Delta Phi. The members of Alpha Kappa Delta Phi competed in the event for the first time this year and performed their own rendition of Disney’s Tangled. In second place for singles competition was Pi Delta Psi for its unique twist on Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory. In the group’s version of the show, Willy Wonka turns out to be Michael Jackson in disguise, thus explaining why three boys were lured to a land of candy and magic without the accompaniment of their parents.
The singles winner was Alpha Epsilon Pi, whose members performed Death of a Salesman. Managing to keep the plot of their show a secret until the performance, their show chronicled the death of a very well-known salesman of our day: Billy Mays. Beginning with his early days selling lemonade and continuing up to a clever scene in which he literally and figuratively “fell off the wagon,” the show was a pleasant surprise for audience members expecting a more traditional Death of a Salesman.
Doubles winners were some of the the most anticipated awards of the night. This year’s third place winners were Delta Gamma and Delta Tau Delta with their take on Tarzan. Second place went to Kappa Alpha Theta and Sigma Phi Epsilon performing Across the Universe. Vocal talents reigned in their performance, and the leads and soloists blended well once the show was under way. Both groups utilized the size of their ensembles and performed large group numbers with difficult choreography.
This year’s doubles winners were Alpha Chi Omega and Sigma Chi, whose members performed Footloose. The show included innovative rotating set pieces, as well as a lot of musical and dancing variety from one number to the next. The men of Sigma Chi performed a number in the show with no musical accompaniment that seemed to wow the audience. Despite the time constraint, the group managed to include a variety of set pieces, dance moves, and singing styles.
The night began and ended with non-competitive performances from sororities Kappa Phi Lambda and Alpha Kappa Alpha. Each group of women performed routines focused on stepping. Yosafat and Kim explained that more than 20 different organizations were involved in the night’s performances including the Greek houses, media outlets, the alumni association, and staff from all over campus. Such widespread involvement is indicative of the spirit of the event, and, together, everyone’s hard work managed to generate over $50,000 for a great cause.

After more than a year of a viral promotional campaign, The Hunger Games was released in domestic theaters this past weekend. Based on the popular young adult book series of the same name, the movie opened with rave reviews from critics and set a record for highest grossing revenue of any non-sequel film and the fifth highest revenue for opening day.
While recent movie adaptations of a book series aimed at a young adult audience have been mostly lackluster (The Golden Compass, Twilight, and Percy Jackson and the Olympians come to mind), The Hunger Games is not only a faithful adaptation, but conveys the story in a more fluid, enjoyable manner than the book does.
The Hunger Games revolves around Katniss — who lives in the dystopian country Panem that is divided into 12 districts and a capitol state — and her experience as a competitor in the Hunger Games. The games are a sporting event in which one girl and one boy, called tributes, are chosen from each district to compete in a battle royale to the death.
The biggest change from page to screen was the narrative shift. While the book was told from a first-person perspective, the movie embraces a broader narrative, extending beyond Katniss to the minor characters. The effect is brilliant. While the huge amount of expository dialogue Katniss unloads to the reader serves its purpose in the novel, excessive cutaway scenes and an overuse of voiceover would have killed the pacing of the movie, which remained tense and quick throughout.
The broader narrative also allowed the movie to explore other characters’ perspectives, which significantly added to the experience. Most notable were the scenes in which the audience views the Gamemakers, who design and control the event, creating changes within the game. These changes included coercing tributes to move in certain directions and altering the weather. The movie also included scenes in which President Coriolanus Snow interacts with Head Gamemaker Seneca Crane, which lend a deeper understanding of the politics of the Hunger Games.
Despite these changes, it was the sound and visuals that stood out most in the movie. While the book relied completely on Katniss’ narrative to create tension, the movie utilized sound. The score was sparse and mainly used for expository scenes and during the conclusion. The games themselves were largely without accompanying background music, as were scenes such as Katniss’ official interview. This resulted in an uneasy atmosphere that was only compounded by the camera work, which utilized quick perspective changes and occasional “shaky-cam.”
Of course, the movie was not without fault. To be fair, this mostly stemmed from the necessary changes in narrative. Much of the information that Katniss reveals in the book, such as historical information on Panem and her own thoughts, is left out. In some cases — such as her relationship with Peeta, the other tribute from her district — this ambiguity is a surprisingly welcome change. But this largely results in characters feeling less fleshed out, to the point where some characters are nameless throughout the film.
While reading The Hunger Games, it is hard not to imagine it as a film, considering the archetypal characters and the gripping narrative. The movie lives up to this expectation and, in some ways, even surpasses it.

Over 3,000 people converged at the Wyndham Grand hotel in downtown Pittsburgh when it hosted Tekkoshocon X, a Japanese culture convention, last Wednesday to Sunday. Many participants, known as cosplayers, came in hand-crafted costumes as anti-zombie commandos, school girls, wizards, aliens, knights, monsters, and more. Those not sporting guises wore shirts that declared their allegiance to superhero teams or their affection for certain video game characters.
This is the 10th Tekkoshocon — a portmanteau of convention and the Japanese word for steel mill. The first convention was the brainchild of a University of Pittsburgh student, who organized the convention in 2002. The event is run wholly by volunteers — from the administrators to those holding up signs indicating where the snaking lines of people clamoring for spots in screenings and panels begin.
One of those volunteers, Barry Marchetto, a junior biology major at Allegheny College of Meadville, has been coming to Tekkoshocon since its inaugural year. “So I figured, why not work here?” Marchetto said. “It gives me something to do in the downtime between panels.”
Having a panel only requires a willingness to do paperwork, leading to a highly diverse set of topics. Some explained the symbolism of the logos of obscure television shows, and others taught the dance moves to the latest pop songs from East Asia. Some of the nerdier aspects of Western culture were also represented, with discussions about the nuances of card games, what it means to be Bronie (an adult fan of My Little Pony), and the webcomic Homestuck.
The convention also featured voice actors who work on the English versions of animes, various musical and comedy acts, and an area for vendors. The vendors were difficult to access, however, since only a limited number of shoppers were allowed at a time. The fourth floor was dedicated to playing card games, a wide selection of video games, and several Dungeons and Dragons campaigns.
Still, cosplayers owned the day. Adventure Time heroes crossed swords with Darth Vader, as the dancing robot of LMFAO music video fame shuffled by the titular character of Inyuasha playing songs from the Persona 4 soundtrack on the lobby piano. The most anticipated events were the Masquerade, a group competition in which cosplayers performed a small talent-show-type skit, and an individual competition where contestants were judged on the quality of their costumes’ construction.
Enthusiasm for the costume aspect of the convention lead to the development of Carnegie Mellon’s own Cosplay Club. Mainly a development of the Vermillion Anime Club, the Cosplay Club was spearheaded by Angelique Rein, a first-year Japanese and linguistics double major. Rein is a veteran cosplayer.
“I started going to conventions as a freshman in high school, and after seeing everybody else, [me and my friends] decided to try it ourselves,” she said. Rein believes that accuracy takes dedication — her costume for Pokémon Gym Leader Erika for Tekkoshocon took over 40 hours of work — but is rewarding in the end. “People take pictures with you, they’re just happy to see you, and all your hard work pays off.”

As odd as it may seem, Pittsburghers can find a slice of the Big Apple in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh until May 27.
This is because the ToonSeum, Pittsburgh’s museum of cartoon and comics art, is currently presenting Will Eisner’s New York, a rare collection of original works by legendary comics pioneer Will Eisner. The exhibit chronicles the artist’s informal history of the city that shaped many of his illustrated masterpieces. Simultaneously personal and universal, Eisner’s depiction of New York City captures the nuance that the greatest of biographers are capable of.
The exhibition is curated by cartoonist and critic Denis Kitchen along with comic book writer and editor Danny Fingeroth; it is presented in partnership with the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art in New York (MoCCA). MoCCA had originally organized the exhibit in 2005, soon after Eisner passed away at the age of 88. The ToonSeum’s display of Will Eisner’s New York is the first time that this particular collection of work has been shown outside of New York City.
Considered one of the most important contributors to the development of the artistic medium of comics, Eisner was best known for his leading role in establishing the graphic novel as a form of literature with his book A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories. In this work and the subsequent works he created during the ’80s and ’90s, Eisner explored the communicative depths of the medium and laid down a framework for generations of aspiring cartoonists.
Will Eisner’s New York allows audiences to explore the artist’s most intriguing element, the ever-changing landscape of New York City. The exhibit includes over 50 original works spanning Eisner’s 70-year career, each capturing a glimpse of the city’s beauty and squalor. Dense but not overwhelming, the exhibit allows visitors to fully experience the city from pre-Depression to modernity. From immigrant ghettos to claustrophobic subways, dirty alleyways to towering rooftops, ramshackle tenements to grandiose bridges, Will Eisner’s New York reveals the artist’s powers of observation and empathy and, above all, the brilliance of his pen.
An exhibit like this makes it possible for visitors to lean forward and peer at the original drawings and, in so doing, increase their appreciation of Eisner’s art. Getting close to the original drawings, and to such a broad array of them, reinforces the notion of Eisner as a master of this 20th-century art form.
The ToonSeum’s main gallery houses the exhibition and displays it in a concentrated yet uncluttered fashion. A lively jazz soundtrack with pieces by the likes of Duke Ellington, Cannonball Adderley, and Cab Calloway accompanies the exhibit and adds the energy of New York to the halls of the ToonSeum.
Small details in the exhibit like a light post, a fire hydrant, and a manhole cover make for nice touches that embellish the exhibition. These details invite visitors to experience the work viscerally, on their own terms, and to develop their own relationship with the master’s work and with the city of New York.
Will Eisner’s New York will be on display through May 27 in the ToonSeum’s main gallery. The ToonSeum is located in downtown Pittsburgh’s Cultural District at 945 Liberty Ave.

Pittsburgh is not known for particularly good weather or road conditions, but somehow there is still a large biking community. Predominantly among college students, biking seems to be a favorite mode of transportation, perhaps because of the price of gas, the difficulty of parking on campus, and the impending bus service cuts. Biking is an ideal way to get around the city — as long as you can deal with intense potholes and a few massive hills.
Biking habits vary greatly from person to person, so it’s all about knowing your options and finding what works for you. It’s no secret that biking is great for your health and for the environment. It’s good exercise, helps reduce stress, allows you freedom to explore, and helps energy efficiency. For experienced cyclists, biking in Pittsburgh may be no big deal, but if you are new to biking in the city — or are still just considering it as an option — there are some basic things you should be aware of before you hit the streets.
Bike Safety
As a cyclist in Pittsburgh, you have to be aware of a variety of safety hazards, including poor road conditions, lack of bike lanes, other motorists, and pedestrians. In a survey of 106 Carnegie Mellon students who bike, the majority said they feel moderately safe while biking in Pittsburgh, but a significant portion feel moderately unsafe. Being aware of your surroundings and finding a route that works for your comfort level is the most important factor for safe biking in and around the city.
Biking on the sidewalk is a good way to gain confidence as a new biker. In fact, 31 percent of survey respondents said that they bike primarily on the sidewalk. Riding on the road requires you to be more alert to your surroundings, since other motorists, like cars and buses, are more unpredictable than pedestrians and often don’t communicate their actions with appropriate turn signals.
To stay aware of your surroundings, you should pay attention not only to what you see around you, but also to what you hear. It’s important to know who is behind you, and, since constantly turning your head to check can be dangerous, listening carefully is a good way to keep track of your surroundings.
61% of respondents wear a helmet at least sometimes while biking (39% wear one always).
69% of respondents bike primarily on the road.
Bike Security
Carnegie Mellon has lots of bike racks around campus, so locking up your bike is convenient no matter where you are. The university is striving towards making campus even more bike-friendly: The Undergraduate Student Senate has formed a committee to address campus biking issues and is working to install more bike racks around campus.
Using bike racks properly is extremely important. Bike parts are valuable and thefts are common. In the survey, over 80 percent lock up their bikes using a U-lock, cable lock, or chain lock.
Organizations like Bike Pittsburgh (BikePGH) have been working to increase the number of bike racks in the city to make Pittsburgh more bike friendly. When parking your bike off campus, lock it up on one of these bike racks or in a highly visible and well-lit area to avoid security issues.
17% of survey respondents do not use any type of lock on their bikes.
73% of survey respondents have not had any security problems, while 11% of survey respondents have had their bikes stolen.
Pittsburgh Organizations
Pittsburgh is home to a large bicycling community. The two most well-known cycling organizations in the city are BikePGH and Free Ride.
BikePGH’s mission is “to establish Pittsburgh as a city that is increasingly safe, accessible, and friendly to bicycle transportation.” Focusing on bike advocacy — increasing the number of bike lanes, adding shared-lane markings to roads that are too narrow for bike lanes, and organizing events like Bike to Work Week and BikeFest — and maintaining up-to-date bike maps, BikePGH has been working on improving biking conditions in the city since 2002.
Free Ride is a DIY recycled bike collective and educational facility located at Construction Junction (214 N. Lexington St.). Free Ride is “dedicated to recycling bicycles, offering mechanical education, and promoting bicycling.” The facility is open as a repair shop and also hosts a number of adult classes, youth programs, and volunteer nights. As a shop, all bicycle parts are free of charge — all that is required in exchange is volunteer hours at the shop.
Bike Trails
Now that the weather is nice, spending an afternoon biking around doesn’t sound so bad. Pittsburgh has a lot of bike trails along the rivers that are useful for efficient transportation around Pittsburgh and feature beautiful views of the city.
The Eliza Furnace Trail follows the Monongahelia River for four miles around Downtown. The trail is ideal for beginner bikers. The Panther Hollow Trail runs along the west side of Schenley Park, down to the Monongahela River. The trail is short — just 1.5 miles — but it connects Oakland and the Carnegie Mellon campus to the Eliza Furnace Trail, so those looking for a longer ride are in luck.
If you’re up for an adventure, the Great Allegheny Passage is the trail for you. Connecting Cumberland, Md., to Pittsburgh, the Great Allegheny Passage boasts beautiful views of western Pennsylvania and is a useful connector for serious bikers.
For more information on bike trails in Pittsburgh, BikePGH has a comprehensive map of bike trails on its website bike-pgh.org.

Dear Patrick,
My one friend “Jen” really hates my other friend “Steve.” However, Steve thinks they’re both really good friends, and I just don’t have the heart to tell him. What can I do to defuse the situation?
Thanks,
Fraternal Relationship Isn’t Exactly Non-Existent; Malevolence Is Entertained Singly
Dear FRIENEMIES,
There are two options here: Either Jen legitimately hates Steve, or she wants to tutti frutti his sweet booty.
If she hates him, then there’s not much you can do. You should just tell Steve what’s going on. Otherwise they’ll just keep running into each other, and he’ll keep ruining her day. If he knows, then he’ll at least have the decency to avoid her. Or he’ll just keep hanging around her out of spite. If it were me, I’d go the spite route. Luckily, everyone loves me. Right? RIGHT?
Right. On the other hand, she may just find herself irresistibly attracted to him and not know how to deal with it. In that case, you should just step aside and let nature take its course. And by “nature,” I mean alcohol. At some point, they’ll both get drunk and hash out those feelings. And by “hash out those feelings,” I mean my editor won’t let me say what they’d actually do.
Or she’ll just slap him,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
My friend’s throwing a birthday party with jello wrestling. I feel like it’s a terrible idea, but he’s insisting on doing it, and has already bought a kiddy pool, tarp, and a few gallons of off-brand jello. What can I do to keep this from being a disaster?
Thanks,
Want Really Entertaining Story, Though Leery of Existing Revelry
Dear WRESTLER,
Judging by that purchase history, your friend is already on an FBI watch list for creepy serial killers. So as long as a bunch of federal agents don’t bust the party, it’ll be a relative success. Really, there’s only one thing you can do in this situation. At some point, you’re just going to have to down a few drinks, hop in that tub, and take on all comers. Sure, your friend probably wants girls in bikinis in there, but he might just have to settle for a drunk guy in a Hawaiian T-shirt. 
Or instead of taking that terrible advice, go to your friend’s house early and just eat all of the jello beforehand. That’s the only way to salvage everything. Grab a spoon, and jump on that jello grenade.
Or maybe there will actually be some slutty girls there,
Patrick Hoskins

When simplified to the most basic interpretation, people dance for two reasons: For a love of movement and for a love of sex. These two motivations dominate any dance floor and are in a constant state of conflict. Unfortunately, it appears that far too many individuals simply see dancing as an opportunity to attract one another.
Imagine yourself at a dance party. Do you know what the DJ is playing? The thumping sounds emitting from the speakers aren’t playing Rihanna and Calvin Harris’ “We Found Love” or even the latest Skrillex jam. Despite this, some people are dancing the night away without a care in world. At the same time, a girl in stiletto heels who is wearing far too much makeup walks up to the DJ and asks for something people can dance to.
Why is only half of the crowd dancing? Perhaps only half of the crowd is dancing for the right reason. Those who dance out of a love of movement do not care about the artist being played, but rather they care about the experience and the atmosphere the DJ is creating. As long as the DJ can create fluid transitions and keep a sense of tension, this crowd could care less what genre of music they are listening to.
On the other hand, those who dance to attract others tend to only dance to music they have heard before. The ability to recognize the song is essential, as this dictates the "appropriate" style of dance. These types of dancers are not truly interested in experiencing the music, but care more about who is looking at them. This over-sexualized form of dancing is ruining the concept of the infinite beat. When a love of movement is removed from the equation, the idea of dancing until sunrise or dancing in the middle of the day seems absurd.
Next time you find yourself listening to music you are unfamiliar with, don’t become distraught. Instead, think about how this music can compel your body to move. If you follow these steps, I promise you’ll have a better time. You might even attract something better than a one-night stand.

Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy
10 12:30
Based on the 1974 novel of the same name, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a 2011 film that follows the hunt for a Soviet spy within MI6 (yes, that’s James Bond’s organization). Gary Oldman plays George Smiley, a semi-retired British spy, who is put on the case to uncover the double agent before it’s too late. Nominated for three Academy Awards, including Oldman for Best Actor, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a skillfully put together espionage film that perfectly blends a sense of mystery, suspense, and drama. (Not So) Fun Fact: Oldman has yet to win an Oscar.
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
10 1
In keeping with the Oscar theme, this film was nominated for five Academy Awards, with one win for Best Film Editing. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a thriller directed by David Fincher and is the English-language version of the Swedish film of the same name. The movie follows Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander, brilliantly played by Daniel Craig and Academy Award nominee Rooney Mara, as they join together to figure out what happened to a girl who has been missing for over 40 years. Fun Fact: The many piercings that Mara has in the film are real — she had them done specifically for the role.
The Descendants
10 12:30
The Descendants is a 2011 film nominated for five Academy Awards, with one win for Best Adapted Screenplay. The movie traces the life of Matt King (George Clooney), a land baron who labels himself as a “back-up parent.” But when a boating accident puts his wife in a coma, King begins to uncover a lot more about his family than he ever thought possible. The Descendants was critically acclaimed for nearly everything, including acting, soundtrack, and visuals. Fun Fact: Jim Rash, who co-won for Best Adapted Screenplay, is one of the stars on the television show Community.
Melancholia
10 12:30
The fourth 2011 film this week, Melancholia, wasn’t nominated for an Academy Award, although it did get Kirsten Dunst Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival. This somewhat trippy sci-fi drama directed by Lars von Trier revolves around the strained relationship between two sisters (Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg) and how the imminent collision between Earth and another planet affects that relationship. Melancholia is told in two parts — one for each sister — and, if nothing else, is a wholly unforgettable film. Fun Fact: There were no rehearsals for this movie; the actors improvised during takes and took instructions afterward.

Amy Quispe and Bryan Wade
Campaign: “Empowering You.”
Fun facts about Amy Quispe: She took a gap year to go to Germany to work for a volunteer organization, lobbied to sell cacti in Dutch despite not speaking Dutch, has programmed since she was a kid, and has a full tuition scholarship.
Fun facts about Bryan Wade: He went to the same high school as Bill Gates.
“We’re not a joke campaign. We’re a serious candidate,” said Amy Quispe, a junior computer science and math double major.
Quispe and junior economics and computer science double major Bryan Wade decided to run because they wanted to make it easier for students to get things done, to form student organizations, and to get funding. “We thought there was a lot of red tape in student government; it is hard to start student organizations and get funding as well,” Wade said.
Quispe and Wade are both Student Senators this year. They said that, as Senators, they have realized that a lot of problems exist within student government. As student body president and vice president, Quispe and Wade say they could fix those problems.
One of the problems they wish to address is with the Committee on Student Organization’s (CoSO) student group policy. Quispe and Wade said that the current policy is very strict as to how a student group may become recognized, because once they are recognized as a group, they immediately get funding. As such, CoSO doesn’t accept student groups very easily.
“We want to make it so there is another group type that it’s very easy to become recognized but it’s ineligible for funding, so that CoSO doesn’t have to worry about this funding issue,” Wade said. “People can become official groups, and can use SpaceQuest, and go to the activities fair and poster — do all these things that they don’t need funding for.”
“We really feel that what students can make and what students can do is most important,” Quispe said. “And removing red tape, whether that’s improving the CoSO process, opening up data, making it easier for student projects to become official.... It’s all about making this campus more alive.”
Will Weiner and Meela Dudley
Campaign: “Silly names, serious campaign.”
Fun facts about Will Weiner: He was once the No. 8 Madden player in New Mexico, once brought a tumble weed back from New Mexico to campus on an airplane, and sang “The Safety Dance” for his entire school at the end of his high school graduation.
Fun facts about Meela Dudley: She is a die-hard Boston Red Sox fan, applied to 20 colleges and was accepted into 19 of them, and speaks four languages.
Junior economics and statistics and decision science double major Will Weiner has been involved with student government since his first year at Carnegie Mellon. Weiner says that there are a lot of changes that need to be made. “Problems have not been addressed well, and I’m going to attack them from different angles,” Weiner said.
Weiner is the Student Senate Chair, on the Pittsburgh Student Government Council, is heading a lobby trip, has helped with musical productions, and is a head orientation counselor. While Weiner has a lot of management positions, he said that “it’s not about [those positions] but about seeing people happy.”
Weiner’s running mate, junior creative writing and professional writing double major Meela Dudley, said, “Without reading our resume, we’re basically the same person. We’re both very busy — but we’ve cleared our schedules for this. We’ve sealed up our different positions and we have three main objectives: recruitment, communication, and presentation.”
Their initiatives focus on communication and fun. Weiner aims to make a logo for the student body president. Student Senate has a logo already, but the president doesn’t. In order to maintain communication with the general public, Weiner said that they would maintain their website after elections.
“We’d post mad minutes every two weeks,” Weiner said. Mad minutes would be a summary of things they’ve covered in meetings. “And if we don’t do something [or] get something that we said we would done, we want you to hold us accountable to it.”
Their website is www.weinerdudley2012.com.
Brian Groudan and Amanda Ho Sang
Campaign: “Your Voice, Your Choice.”
Fun facts about Brian Groudan: He is half Chinese and half European, and  is from New York. He’s also taken a class in every college except for CIT.
Fun facts about Amanda Ho Sang: She lived in Singapore for 10 years, her parents are from Jamaica, she studied in Oxford, and she once saw Emma Watson on the street.
Neither junior information systems and human-computer interaction double major Brian Groudan nor decision science and psychology double major Amanda Ho Sang have held any student government positions. However, Groudan was on the TedxCMU team, was an orientation counselor for Mudge for two years, is a teaching assistant, and will be an RA in West Wing next year. He said he is running for office because he wants to give back to the student body and to “a campus that’s given [him] so much.”
“I think that through the things I’ve been involved with, I have a really good perspective and reach on campus,” Groudan said.
Ho Sang said she has been part of Dancers’ Symposium, has served on the Dance Marathon Executive Committee, and was a teaching assistant.
“I think that Brian and I, collectively, have had a lot of different experiences here at CMU, and we’ve really tried to take advantage of all the things we are a part of,” Ho Sang said.
Groudan and Ho Sang said they have four main areas they intend to focus on. Two of the areas are balance and efficiency. By balance, they mean using recreational places to create a stress-free working environment for students and having convenient transportation for students to use.
By efficiency, they mean streamlining certain processes to make students’ lives easier, making it more convenient for students to access information, and creating a digital and physical calendar.
“The core aspect of student body president and vice president,” Groudan said, “is to be the voice of the students, and that’s the approach we’ve taken in our campaign.”
Seth Vargo and Joe Frick
Campaign: “In Plaid We Trust.”
Fun facts about Seth Vargo: He owns three companies, works 60 hours a week for the university, was offered $250,000 to drop out of school at a conference, and once worked for a site that was hacked by a foreign country.
Fun facts Joe Frick: He had a year-and-a-half modeling stint that he didn’t think he would do, got three of his fingers crushed by Vargo karate kicking a door, played baseball twice in the PNC Park, and has kissed the Stanley Cup.
Junior information systems major Seth Vargo and junior economics major Joe Frick decided to run because they want to keep moving student government forward. Some of the initiatives they would like to accomplish are: improving dining, getting the university to give back to students, and empowering students to accomplish their own ideas.
“I have really good relationships with CulinArt. Through my experience and conversations with them, it’s actually not CulinArt’s fault [that food is subpar], but the university’s because the university forces them to serve certain food,” Vargo said. “So instead of trying to get better food on campus, we want to extend dining and bring DineX or at least PlaidCash to start down Craig Street and into Oakland.”
The university taxes alumni donations by 5 percent, so an organization only actually  receives $95 of a $100 donation. This tax was enacted last year and will increase to 6.9 percent, and then 9.6 percent in the following years. “We’d really like to see the university give back to the students,” Vargo said.
Vargo and Frick say that they also intend to empower students by helping them accomplish their own ideas. “Instead of saying ‘we’ll take care of it,’ we’ll say, ‘what do you need to get it done?’ So if someone has an idea, we’re going to give them the opportunity to run with it on their own before we say we’ll do it for you,” Vargo said. “A single individual can make a difference, and we want to make sure they know that.”

Senior materials science and engineering and biomedical engineering double major Matthew Biegler is running an unorthodox presidential campaign. 
With his slogan, “Cat-Hat Party. Cats cannot walk, cats cannot talk,” a platform of seemingly unlikely ideas, and a colorful campaign website, Biegler is turning heads.
Biegler has a 13-step plan if he is elected into office. One of the steps involves implementing a balloon room on campus. Another step is to have a limo shuttle going from the Skibo Gym to Morewood Gardens. Only students living in Morewood would be allowed to take the limo shuttle.
“This is awful,” said Ninar Nuemah, senior electrical and computer engineering major. “It seems like he’s not taking it very seriously, and he’s mostly doing it as a joke, which is amusing but stupid.”
When asked if Biegler and his running mate, second-year architecture student Amy Friedman, were taking this election seriously, Biegler said, “We’re on the ballot.”
“I think they’re funny, but it’s kind of obnoxious also that he’s up there stealing votes. Those votes can be going to people [who need it],” said first-year physics major Sonal Nanda.
As testimony to his credentials, Biegler said that he went to a student government meeting last year and that he has good ideas. 
“[Our ideas] are actually outlined in our platform and it’s on our website. We are the first candidates to have a platform and a website,” Biegler said. 
Biegler also said he was a cabinet member under former student body president Jarett Adams two years ago and was on an election campaign committee last year. Due to these experiences, Biegler said he knew that a lot of money  went into the Executive Board and that there was a large working budget.
“I’m hoping to utilize that [budget],” Biegler said. “I’ve felt that it may’ve been under-utilized in the past. I’m not sure. I really don’t know anything about student government.”
Biegler’s campaign website is mattyb4prez.angelfire.com.

Jake Flittner remains student body president after Thursday evening’s joint Undergraduate Student Senate and Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) meeting. The vote for impeachment did not officially occur, as GSA did not have enough members attending to meet its 3/4 quorum.
Flittner, a senior mechanical engineering and engineering and public policy double major, faced impeachment hearings after Senate unanimously requested on March 1 that he be removed from office. At Thursday’s meeting, the impeachment motion was presented to the joint session, and Flittner presented arguments in defense of his role. He emphasized that Senate and GSA members should “stick to the constitution” when deciding their vote, arguing that he has fulfilled nearly every duty that is outlined for his position in the Student Body Constitution.
During his defense, Flittner admitted to missing a few meetings and to a lack of concrete progress toward achieving his campaign goals. Specifically, he addressed the issue of transparency between himself and Student Senate, saying that it was the “biggest one that we failed at.” However, Flittner made sure to emphasize that, despite what he felt to be small failures, he accurately “represented the voice of the student body to the administration” throughout his term.
Flittner made comparisons to the previous student body president, Jarrett Adams. He said, “Stepping into this office, I didn’t have a single document from my predecessor.... I came into this with a clean slate.” He also criticized the vague wording of the Student Body Constitution, especially in the representation section of his duties.
Senate, GSA, and others present then discussed the impeachment motion for almost an hour. A common theme of the discussion was a debate whether the motion for impeachment should be based on the president’s constitutional duties or on Student Senate’s satisfaction with Flittner’s progress.
Senator Seth Vargo, a junior information systems major and a candidate in this year’s student body presidential race, did not seem impressed by Flittner’s defense. He especially disagreed with Flittner’s critique of the Student Body Constitution. “The purpose of this meeting isn’t to decide the bylaws and constitution, but whether he’s fulfilled them,” he said. “Even if it wasn’t part of his platform, I would have expected that he would have moved to change them during his term.”
Student Body Vice President for Organizations Will Zhang, a senior computer science major, sided with Flittner. “I agree with a lot of Jake’s points. Honestly, I really don’t think it’s a big deal anyway,” he said. “I think [the Executive Committee] is well run. I think the only part of what he hasn’t really fulfilled is his discretionary objectives. Speaking as a second semester senior, it’s really easy to check out.”
Zhang continued, touching on Flittner’s fulfillment of his constitutional duties. “They’re guidelines. You can’t follow them 100 percent,” he said. “If you want to impeach him because you haven’t seen tangible results, then that’s a valid reason.”
Andrew Ramey, a doctoral student in history who was present at the hearing, summarized his feelings on Flittner’s performance succinctly. “He admitted to not fulfilling his duties,” he said. “This is a cut and dry case. You can’t pick and choose.”
Senator Jon Mark, a junior lighting design major and current candidate for student body vice president for finance, initially called for Flittner’s impeachment and made the final comment before the discussion period closed. “I think it comes back a lot to perception issues,” he said. “The things that were moving along, that were happening, were a result of [Student Body Vice President Sangita Sharma]. I know she wants to say they’re a team, but when it comes to student government, she would do a better job.... Senate really does believe that doing this is the right thing to be doing for the student body.”
After discussion, Senate Chair Will Weiner, a junior social and decision science and economics and statistics double major, called for a vote from both bodies. Due to GSA’s lack of quorum, the vote was unofficial, but the votes were still tallied. Undergraduate Student Senate voted 19–8 in favor of impeachment, and GSA voted 22–23. 
Flittner would not have been impeached even had the votes been official, as neither body achieved the required 3/4 super majority of votes in favor of the motion. Because the request for impeachment was only valid for three weeks and the vote did not occur, the motion expired.
Reflecting on the event, Sharma felt good about the discussion at the hearing. “It provided great feedback. I was genuinely happy with both sides of the argument. Nothing was a personal attack, nothing was too one-sided,” she said. “I think it was really well discussed. I think that people responded well to Jake’s defense.... People understood that a lot of this was a miscommunication on both ends. People came in with an open mind, which is great.”
Moving forward, she hopes that she and Flittner can work to improve transparency and communication for the remainder of their terms, as well as improve the transition to new leadership. “I think that Jake and I will work really hard to make sure that whoever comes in next year has that message,” she said. “We’re going to work towards constitution changes and make things more clear.”
“We don’t want them to come in unprepared,” Sharma said, speaking about the current student body president candidates. “A lot of people are running this year, and no matter who comes in, this job is a lot different than they think.”

The Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) recently voted to contribute $175,000 from its capital reserve funds to the official Carnegie Mellon endowment.
As GSA president and economics Ph.D. student Jason Imbrogno wrote in the official announcement of this decision, “This is a testament to both the strength of our graduate student body and its leadership. I venture to say that nowhere else in the world is another student government wrestling with such significant decisions that can impact their university communities to such a high degree.”
Imbrogno thanked GSA Vice President for Finance Will Boney, Vice President for Campus Affairs Michael Murphy, and GSA Vice President for Finance Grace Heckmann for their assistance in this process.
Andy Schultz, materials science Ph.D. student and Vice President for Campus Affairs for the GSA, preferred to frame the contribution in terms of an investment rather than a donation. 
“The GSA will get income from interest on that money, which can be used to fund activities,” Schultz explained. “This money directly benefits graduate students immediately.”
Electrical and computer engineering Ph.D. student Peter Klemperer said that he was “a little surprised that GSA had that much money left over” for such a donation.
The GSA capital reserve has increased in size over the past few years due to unspent student activities fees and budget surpluses, and Imbrogno has stated that spending down the surplus in this account would be a main goal of his presidency. 
Heckmann said in an email that prior to the donation, there had been about $220,000 in the GSA capital reserve.
Klemperer had greater support for the idea of collecting interest on the money, which he said he had not previously been aware of. “That wasn’t explained at all that way in the email from the GSA president,” he said. Klemperer still expressed concern over the quantity of funds the GSA had sitting in the capital reserve account.
Imbrogno stated in the same announcement that the GSA would also appropriate $35,000 from the capital reserve account for a new campus bike rack project. Schultz explained that the choice to fund the new bike rack project resulted from a survey sent around last year asking for input on what the GSA should fund.
“The resounding answer was bike racks,” Schultz said.
The project is currently being overseen by a committee consisting of GSA members, Undergraduate Student Senate representatives, and faculty members. It includes the plans to create a bike station in currently available space in the Gates Center garage.
Schultz concluded that the funds and interest gained from this contribution would “go toward projects that would benefit graduate students for a long time.”

The OM organization brought five speakers and a dance group to the Carnegie Music Hall on Saturday to share their views on happiness in an event called OMx.
The five speakers were Tim Bono, a professor of psychology at Washington University in St. Louis; Hari Chandan, a post-doctoral fellow at Carnegie Mellon’s department of engineering and public policy; Indira Nair, Carnegie Mellon’s former vice provost for education; Patty Eppley, a meditation expert; and Helen Wang, a Carnegie Mellon housefellow. They were joined by the Pitt Nrityamala, an Indian classical dance team.
Bono discussed the ways the focus of one’s attention determines one’s happiness. He described studies which showed that people randomly assigned to think about good things that had happened to them in the previous week became happier than people randomly assigned to think about bad things. “One of the easiest ways to increase happiness is to regularly practice gratitude,” Bono said.
Chandan explained the Hindu spiritual approach to happiness. He told a parable of two birds sitting in a tree. One eats fruit, some sweet and some sour, and is happy and sad accordingly. The other eats nothing, and is fulfilled of its own glory. Occasionally, the fruit-eating bird glimpses the fulfilled bird. Chandan said that our true nature is that of the fulfilled bird.
“If our real nature is that infinite happiness, why don’t we see it? Because we are too distracted all the time,” Chandan said. He described the four Hindu paths to happiness: knowledge, devotion, action, and meditation.
Nair said that she believes happiness can be found through authenticity, integrity, and mindfulness. When she took her children to campus in the ’80s, they asked her, “Why does nobody smile at Carnegie Mellon?” By the ’90s, she said, the campus was happier. Nair said that one of the reasons for the change is that there is more love at Carnegie Mellon now. According to Nair, love, connection, and kindness are the keys to happiness, and they can be achieved by practicing authenticity, integrity, and mindfulness.
Junior information systems major Christian Reyes said that he connected to Nair’s presentation. “She spoke right to me, with the idea that you don’t have to worry about what others think,” he said. “That really resonated.”
Eppley focused on meditation. She said that regular meditation had made her a happy person. Eppley said that in her adult life, she had once been a “crisis meditator” who only meditated when things went wrong. Then, she said, her life fell apart. She went to study meditation with Deepak Chopra, a physician who specializes mind-body medicine. Later, Eppley was going to travel to India to find a guru, but found she did not need to. “The guru is within,” Eppley said.
Wang discussed her personal journey to happiness, speaking about pain. She said that discussing and acknowledging our pain is not detrimental to happiness, nor is it necessarily selfish. “When we give our story to the world, we celebrate our common humanity. We create safe spaces for others to have their pain lifted off of them. And when we do that, we create happiness.”
Wang told a story about her first years in America. She would bring lunches full of her mother’s cooking to school, and other students made fun of it because it looked and smelled strange to them. Eventually, Wang traded her beloved curry for turkey sandwiches and juice boxes.
After she grew up, though, Wang said that she learned that she was denying a huge part of who she is. She said that she stopped doing that, started being who she really was, and became happier. Wang stressed that, in order to be happy, we need to be our effortless, authentic selves. “We walk in the world as if we were broken, but really, everything that we have is more than enough.”
Attendees liked Wang’s section of the presentation. “I thought she had a good perspective on Carnegie Mellon students,” said Vicente Estrada, a first-year in CIT.
“She seemed to really believe what she was saying,” said junior cognitive science major Susan Dou. “If she didn’t have her notes, I bet she would have made the same speech.”
The six presentations were structured around a narrative, delivered by junior information systems and decision science double major Archit Kumar, the president of OM. Kumar played a Carnegie Mellon student named Arjun Patel, a senior chemical engineering major, who was searching for happiness. Each of the presentations was meant to be a person or experience Arjun engaged with along his journey.
First-year CIT student Vijay Iyengar, one of OMx’s co-chairs, said that the point of OMx was not to teach happiness, but to make attendees think about the way they practice happiness in their own lives. Every speaker touched on that idea. “The shortest distance between point A and point B is a straight line. And each of our speakers converges into one straight line,” Iyengar said.
He said that he has already started putting some of the speakers’ ideas into practice in his own life. In particular, he said, he has taken Eppley’s advice to heart. “I have started taking five minutes out of each day to just step back and distance myself.”
Proceeds from OMx were donated to the Ekal Vidyalaya Foundation, which sets up single-teacher schools in small villages.

Rishi Patel
Sophomore business administration and decision science double major Rishi Patel is running on a platform of funding improvements. Patel, who is currently a member of the Joint Funding Committee (JFC), believes that funding is one of the most pressing problems Carnegie Mellon student organizations are facing.
“Funding is definitely an issue right now,” Patel said. “Right now JFC has cut a lot of budgets because we don’t have enough money to allocate to all the organizations.”
To relieve student organizations of some of their financial burdens, Patel says that he would work to improve organizations’ relationships with their alumni and foster communication between JFC and the Committee on Student Organizations (CoSO).
“Alumni relations is a great way to tap into an untapped resource and get money for organizations,” Patel said. As vice president for organizations, Patel said that he would try to show student organizations how to connect to alumni. Patel said that his fraternity, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, has the best alumni relations program on campus, and that he would use the knowledge he has gained there to help other organizations.
Patel said that he would also work to institute meetings between JFC and CoSO once a semester. “I want to make sure that people on JFC know the CoSO process, because right now they really don’t know that much about it. I feel like you have to have knowledge of both JFC and CoSO to be on either organization,” Patel said.
Patel also said that he would like to create a booklet of best practices for organizations. The booklet would contain information on how to get space on campus, how to fundraise, and other strategies that Patel feels organizations should understand. The Office of Student Activities currently publishes an annual handbook for student organizations that explains the recognition and funding processes, space and event planning, and university policies.
Patel’s platform also includes plans to revamp the current CoSO organization categories, promote an increase of the Student Activities Fee, and establish awards for well-run student organizations.
Patel hopes to advocate for student organizations. “Right now, if you’re a member of an organization, it’s hard for you to get your voice out there to representatives in the administration. I feel like the VPO’s the person who represents the organizations, and bridges the gap between them and the administration.”
Alyssa Danesh
Alyssa Danesh, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major, is running on a platform of strengthening the Committee on Student Organizations (CoSO) and improving communications with student organizations.
As vice president for organizations, Danesh said that she would improve the transparency of the organization recognition process; make CoSO stronger and more efficient; educate organizations about CollegiateLink, the proposed new platform that will replace BudgetTracker and OrgTracker; and act as an advocate for student organizations.
Danesh, who is serving her second year on CoSO, said that she would set clear deadlines for the organization recognition process.
She also wants to ensure that people take CoSo seriously by making members reapply each year. “This year, the Committee on Student Organizations is made up of about 15 people, and we have a big problem with attendance,” Danesh said. “We have a big problem with taking things seriously, and it is a pretty serious thing. Being recognized means a lot to an organization. It means we’re giving them the Student Activities Fee. It’s a lot of money. I think that it’s important that the people in CoSO are taking it seriously.”
Danesh said that she also wishes to establish office hours to educate student organizations on CollegiateLink in the hope that they will use the platform more heavily than they currently use OrgTracker. 
She also plans to speak to the leaders of established organizations to compile a database of advice for new organizations on how to run an organization effectively.
Danesh is also the current chair of the Senate Communications Committee.
Danesh said that during her time on Communications Committee, she worked to rebrand Student Senate. She said that the experience has taught her how to communicate with the student body, an ability which she feels is key to the role of VPO.
“As it stands right now, organizations look at the VPO and say, ‘Oh, okay, so it’s this person who I have to go through for recognition. So I’m going to get recognized, and once a year I’ve got to do this,’ ” Danesh said. “And that’s part of the role of VPO. But the big part of it is acting as that advocate. You’re the vice president of organizations, so the organizations are what you’re representing. I think that it’s very important that the VPO act more as that kind of advocate.”

Junior lighting design major Jon Mark is the only candidate running for student body vice president for finance, but he is still campaigning.
“The VPF role is organized around the student organizations: managing student accounts, making sure everyone plays by the rules, and dividing up the student activities fee,” Mark said.
As vice president of finance, Mark said he wants to “bring back knowledge to everyone” about the financial process of hosting events by holding office hours.
“They’d be laid back, fun, and we’d work to get an event down to the correct budget,” he said.
As for experience, Mark has served in the Undergraduate Student Senate for every possible semester of his Carnegie Mellon education, and has served on the Joint Funding Committee (JFC).
Speaking about his experience serving on the JFC, Mark said, “Looking at the process, I don’t see it as efficient.”
As part of his plans to improve the process by which the JFC operates, Mark said that he wants “to put more power into the hands of the representatives to make a recommendation” regarding an activities budget.
In terms of the student activities fee, Mark is in support of a 20 percent increase. He said that the budgets currently being requested by student organizations would require a 40 percent increase in funding, and he wants to meet that number halfway, “invest[ing] that 20 percent back into CMU.”
“I’m a pretty intimidating character; I wouldn’t want to run against me either,” Mark said, joking about his status as the only vice president for finance candidate.
Switching to a more serious tone, Mark added that he was surprised that, for two consecutive years, no one has run for what he considers “the most powerful position” up for election.

First-year students place second in math tournament
Three first-year Mellon College of Science students placed second in the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition. The students — math majors Michael Druggan, Albert Gu, and Archit Kulkarni — are members of the Knaster-McWilliams Scholars program, which is funded by two alumni and provides students with increased access to faculty and early research opportunities.
To win second place, Druggan, Gu, and Kulkarni answered 12 math problems in six hours. Over 4,000 American and Canadian undergraduates participated in the tournament, which was held in December. The results were released this month.
“This remarkable success is a reflection of the high caliber of students in Carnegie Mellon’s Department of Mathematical Sciences, as well as a reflection on the students’ hard work and dedication,” said mathematics professor Po-Shen Loh, the team’s coach, in a university press release. “At Carnegie Mellon we have developed an innovative undergraduate program, which leads the brightest undergraduate mathematicians to achieve their full potential.”
Druggan, Gu, and Kulkarni’s second-place finish is the highest a Carnegie Mellon team has ever placed in the competition. The Department of Mathematical Sciences will receive $20,000 as a result, and Druggan, Gu, and Kulkarni will each receive $800.
NSBE conference to be held at local convention center
The 38th annual conference of the National Society of Black Engineers will be held in Pittsburgh this Wednesday to Sunday. Carnegie Mellon will have a booth the conference, which will be held in the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in Downtown.
Carnegie Mellon’s booth will consist of current graduate students and representatives from the Office of Undergraduate Admission. Steelers mascot Steely McBeam will also be present to greet participants. The College of Engineering will co-sponsor bags that will be given out to all convention-goers. The college also made a slideshow to showcase the Carnegie Mellon experience.
Carnegie Institute of Technology Dean Pradeep K. Khosla will host a kick-off lunch for graduate students at the conference. “Participation in this conference is very important as we continue to build the workforce of the future and remain competitive globally,” Khosla said in a university press release.
“The world’s increasing globalization demands more interaction with people from diverse cultures and backgrounds, so this NSBE conference is an excellent opportunity to reach a large, talented, and diverse audience,” said Kurt Larsen, assistant dean of undergraduate studies at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, in the press release.

The Fence tradition began in 1923 when the senior class painted a soon-to-be-demolished wooden fence to advertise a party. Destruction was postponed, and the Fence is now perhaps the most recognizable and beloved part of Tartan school spirit. With an 89-year history that includes such events as reconstruction after collapse, wedding proposals, and vandalization, the Fence has been through a lot. Here are a few facts about the Fence that you may not have known:
4: The current difference in inches between the height of the first post and that of the last post
64: The current average circumference in inches of the Fence’s posts 
6: The world-record-setting thickness of the paint of the original Fence, in inches
20: The approximate diameter in inches of the Fence’s six caps

The impeachment process of Carnegie Mellon’s Student Body President, Jake Flittner, was a failure on several levels.
The Undergraduate Student Senate unanimously called for Flittner’s impeachment on March 1. Senate Chair Will Weiner and Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) president Jason Imbrogno proceeded to schedule the hearing March 22, on the last possible day to impeach Flittner. GSA then failed to reach quorum, without the 53 members required to vote — 46 of the 70 members showed — and the impeachment hearing was null.
This hearing was meant to be the turning point, at which Carnegie Mellon’s student government would get its act together and start following its own rules. Its purpose was to show that members of Senate and GSA would not stand for those who shirk their constitutional duties and would set a precedent for the future.
While failing to achieve quorum for an impeachment hearing of a student government known for his absenteeism is embarrassing, it is not the reason why the motion failed. The sentiments of the impeachment hearing did not match those of the movement to impeach, where Student Senate unanimously voted to proceed with the impeachment hearing against Flittner.
Instead of recognizing that Flittner had blatantly left his duties unfulfilled, excuses were made that portrayed the Student Body Constitution as a mere guideline.
Student Senate did not hold Flittner to his constitutional standards.
The situation shows how Student Senate has been unable to follow through on initiatives that would benefit the student body.
Impeaching Flittner would have been a significant step toward reaching that goal, simply because student government would have followed through with an attempt to reform itself.
Hopefully in the future, Senate will take the necessary measures to put student interest first by following through with initiatives to remedy problems, especially those within Senate.

Whether you’re a self-proclaimed “gleek,” an occasional watcher, or only know about it through Facebook status updates, it’s undeniable that the television show Glee has become an important part of modern pop culture. As of late, the show has been addressing some pretty serious topics — a big change from the campy, all-smiles episodes in the earlier seasons.
The only scandal back then was which glee club members were cheating on their superficial relationship partners.
But now, for every absurd and hilarious insult said by Sue Sylvester, the show’s antagonist whose mission is to disband the glee club, there’s another scene that leaves you shocked at the seriousness of the situation.
The show recently documented anti-homosexuality bullying, a suicide attempt, a confession of a character’s previous thoughts of suicide, teen marriage, and a car crash involving texting while driving — all in one episode.
Among all these grave issues, the singing troupe still managed to compete at the always-occurring sectionals, which left viewers with a confusing mix of emotions throughout the episode. Glee is becoming more of a social commentary than it ever has been, but are they overloading? Is this seriousness too much, too abruptly?
It seems that the show’s writers have finally realized the power they hold in their creation. While I respect the show for finally addressing serious topics, it seems they’re throwing in these plot elements just to create a stir.
The characters (and the show) become a bit ridiculous if every situation finds a character having a deep-seated emotional experience. If the writers were going for realism, they’re starting to lose it.
One character, Santana — who’s known as a flirtatious and sexual temptress — has come to display the powerful emotions of a secret same-sex relationship, while keeping her sexual orientation private. In a recent episode, she decided to come out to her grandmother, who disapproved and told her, “Everyone has secrets ... they’re called secrets for a reason.”
This tearful interaction came after the rumor spread through school and a guy came up to her claiming that he can “straighten her out.” We empathize with this character who can’t catch a break, but we’re quickly encouraged to sympathize with another depressing situation only 10 minutes later.
However, Glee gets it right with a scene where three of the main characters discuss their senior year. With the impending approach of graduation for the main characters, the future of the show is constantly up for debate.
When discussing college rejection letters, the trio talk about how college was always just a distant event. The effervescent Kurt says dramatically, “The future used to be such an abstract idea. The dream was enough.”
The show has rarely seen such resounding simplicity that is so effective. Moments like this are when Glee shines brightest.
The upcoming graduation may have writers trying to cram in as many storylines as they can, and unintentionally overdoing it. The army of outcasts are facing mature and realistic situations, but the overloading is becoming quite a distraction. Glee should adopt the notion of less is more because when it’s good, it’s great.

A great deal of attention has turned to college campus security in Pittsburgh over the past month.
On March 8, tragedy struck the University of Pittsburgh’s campus when a man opened fire in the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic of UPMC, killing one and injuring seven before being killed by University of Pittsburgh police.
Between March 14 and March 22, three bomb threats occurred at the Cathedral of Learning, with mandatory evacuations and searches concluding each one was a false threat. Almost one month ago, Carnegie Mellon had a bomb scare, with Warner Hall and Smith Hall being evacuated.
Our deepest gratitude goes to the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and the campus police of Carnegie Mellon and Pitt. However, there were problems with the CMU ALERT Emergency Notification Service (ENS) that led to some students not receiving warnings for some emergencies. This problem needs to be fixed so that students are aware of these situations, especially since many live in Oakland.
While some students and faculty received an alert by text or voice recording from the CMU ALERT ENS after the March 8 shooting, for others the only official notification they received was an email from President Jared Cohon a day later expressing his condolences for the victims of the shooting and thanking the city and campus police. 
For a period of time on March 8, the whereabouts and location of the shooter were unknown, which led the city police to block portions of the campus. Central Catholic High School on Fifth Avenue was put on a lockdown.
It is a serious issue when students who are signed up to receive these alerts have no indication that an emergency is occurring near where they live.
When there are students living in Carnegie Mellon housing mere blocks away from a potential shooter on the run, they should be notified of the risks. While a message was sent, it was not received by everyone signed up for the service. The number of Carnegie Mellon students who reside in Oakland warrants more notifications for emergencies at Pitt, and the technical issues that occurring with the CMU ALERT ENS need to be resolved.

On March 5, the non-profit group Invisible Children released the video “Kony 2012,” which details the brutal war crimes of Joseph Kony, head of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), including coercing children to become soldiers. Invisible Children activists not only raise awareness of Kony’s inhumane actions, but also direct military intervention and giving aid to the the Ugandan military.
The “Kony 2012” campaign has done more than just raise awareness about the war criminal Kony. It has harkened a new era for social activism and political awareness — one that utilizes the recent surge in social media usage.
In less than a month, it has amassed over 84 million views thanks to its viral marketing campaign, which gained massive attention through social media platform giants such as Facebook and Tumblr.
This is not the first time that social media has helped raise awareness of political issues. However, “Kony 2012” is singular in its widespread circulation. It made the rounds on sites such as Tumblr, which has a reputation for circulating political interest stories from varying perspectives such as the corruption of Hosni Mubarak, police brutality during the peak of the Occupy movements, and the death of Trayvon Martin.
While professional media sources presented information on the “Kony 2012” movement, its exposure was greatly assisted by people posting links on their profiles and blogs. One of the most notable examples I saw was a video by a Ugandan citizen giving her opinion on “Kony 2012” reblogged thousands of times on Tumblr. This unique viewpoint could never have been seen so widely before social media became popular.
In the days after the “Kony 2012” video was released, it was impossible to look on your Facebook newsfeed and not see references to the video. While Tumblr is based on the idea that you can follow any person or organization without personally knowing the individual or group, Facebook is geared almost exclusively toward social networking with people you know.
As such, most posts on Facebook are aimed toward disseminating personal information. While there are occasional political debates, they are often isolated to one conversation or one picture. 
Invisible Children’s campaign shattered that notion and has opened up an entirely new venue for viral, grassroots campaigning.
However, it is dangerous to ignore the pitfalls of a campaign such as “Kony 2012.” As benign a cause “Kony 2012” may appear to be, it is also biased, and some aspects of the video are misleading. For example, Kony and the LRA have not been active in Uganda since 2006, making the idea of sending aid to the Ugandan government questionable, especially given the Ugandan government’s own history of using child soldiers.
Regardless of how accurate “Kony 2012” is, the video’s immediate dispersion through Facebook and Tumblr has opened a new realm of possibilities for grassroots activism. It would not be surprising if other campaigns in the near future mimic the marketing strategy that Invisible Children used.
While this is wonderful in terms of spreading information, we cannot be content to merely reblog a video or buy action kits.
It is too easy for sincere activism to degenerate into something trendy. We have to thoroughly research organizations and the causes that they support and remain persistent above all.

In Florida, you can be legally fired for wearing an orange shirt. Under the doctrine of at-will employment, it’s possible to be fired for something as arbitrary as wearing a sherbet colored top if your employer deems it a worthy reason.
Executives at the Deerfield Beach law firm of Elizabeth R. Wellborn, P.A., utilized this law when they fired 14 employees two weeks ago simply for wearing orange shirts. A group of employees had been wearing the shirts for several Fridays “so they’d look like a group when they went out for happy hour,” according to the Sun Sentinel.
Executives said there had been a previous protest involving orange shirts. Furthermore, they believed that because the employees were all wearing orange, the workers must have been involved in this vague and undefined protest and should, of course, be fired.
This incident demonstrates the unnecessary extremity of the law. Legislators in Florida, and in every state, should reevaluate laws, especially those along the lines of the at-will employment laws.
There was no office policy against wearing orange shirts. Perhaps the executives of the law firm were simply trying to keep a diversity of clothing from entering the workplace. Maybe they saw the orange shirts spreading like a plague and decided to root it out, before the last boring striped tie and sullen face disappeared. Possibly, they just don’t like happy hour.
We at the Tartan are inclined to think they saw this orange-shirted trend and decided to grab an opportunity to cut a little fat from the company. Florida is one of the few states that still practices a very rudimentary at-will employment doctrine: The state allows an employer to discharge his employees “for a good reason, for a bad reason or even for the wrong reason, as long as it’s not an unlawful reason,” according to Eric Gabrielle, a Florida labor and employment lawyer.
Other states have moved past this archaic doctrine by adding various exceptions and implied contracts that help level the employer-employee playing field. These exceptions protect employees from employer retaliation if they were to report on illegal company activity or if an implied contract’s existence can be proven.
Florida has no such protections for its employees, and instances such as the mystifying mass firing of 14 law firm employees are a strong indicator that the state might want to rethink things.

If you’re interested at all in the affairs of Wall Street, then you’ve probably heard about Greg Smith. After resigning as vice president for Goldman Sachs, Smith published an opinion piece in The New York Times titled “Why I Am Leaving Goldman Sachs,” criticizing the company’s culture. Smith’s article points out two main flaws at Goldman Sachs: First, that the company is not working to help its clients but rather to make the most money off them; second, that it suffers from a culture of arrogance and disrespect toward clients.
Smith writes that Goldman Sachs wasn’t always like this, and, indeed, when he joined the firm 12 years ago, Goldman Sachs had just gone through a very momentous change. After more than 100 of years as a partnership, Goldman Sachs went public in 1999. That is when many like Smith think the company started to lose its moral compass.
The initial public offering only gave up a small ownership stake to traders, but after several more stock offerings in the following years, the company’s ownership became increasingly diluted with pension funds, investment management companies, and banks. With a few exceptions, shareholders like these manage many investments and only have the time and energy to worry about a company’s bottom line. In contrast, a private partnership might care about more than just revenues and may value intangibles like preserving a certain company culture or staying true to a certain ethical or moral code.
Any first-year business student can tell you that in a publicly owned firm, an employee’s primary responsibility is to the shareholders — not to the customers, not to a boss, and not necessarily to any code of ethics. In executive positions, employees act on the shareholders’ behalf. Since shareholders want a better return on investment, employees arguably have an obligation to do whatever it takes to achieve a better bottom line, even if that means exploiting clients for profits by recommending that they buy mortgage-backed securities while the company itself is shorting them.
Obviously, not all publicly traded companies are like Goldman Sachs, assuming Smith described the bank accurately. Southwest, for instance, comes to mind as a company with a widely admired culture. Moreover, not all private partnerships are beacons of morality. But you can imagine how in a company as driven, competitive, prestigious, and ruthless in bringing home profits as Goldman Sachs is, secondary concerns like caring about customers could get lost.
The culture of arrogance, however, may also be an indirect result of Goldman Sachs’ going public. Although shareholders’ pressure did not dictate that clients be referred to as “muppets,” it’s likely that it created an extremely vicious and competitive environment. Even in his article in Forbes criticizing Smith, former Goldman Sachs employee John Tamny confirmed this up-or-out, eat-what-you-kill culture: “Those who don’t produce are let go, and to produce they must beat their contemporaries at competing investment banks; many of those competitors eager to beat a Goldman Sachs that once neglected to hire them, or that once fired them.”
So, being employed and moving up the corporate ladder at Goldman Sachs is not just a source of income, but also implies that you are the best at what you do and “beat” the other people in your field, as you would in a sport. It’s human nature to feel just a little bit arrogant in this type of culture. Since clients are merely sources of revenue, it’s not hard to imagine how you could feel disrespectful toward them.
None of this, though, necessarily makes putting profits over customers or treating customers with disrespect right or even acceptable. These are exactly the type of attitudes that sparked movements like Occupy Wall Street.
However, given the fact that little has gotten better after the 2008 financial crisis, arguably a consequence of the culture on Wall Street, it’s hard to say if and how things might change.

In response to the article regarding the Armenian Genocide denial law, there are a few comments that should be made.
First off, there already exists in France a law against the Holocaust Denial which serves as a direct precedence for this genocide denial bill as France accepts both genocides. So the author should argue against both the Holocaust denial law and Armenian Genocide denial law.
Second, an EU framework was established in 2007, in combating racism and xenophobia, which said as part of that framework, genocide denial should be punished in EU member states. So not only was France following up on the Holocaust denial precedence, but also, as an EU member, carrying out this framework that applies to it.
Hence, it is uncalled for the writer to characterize France’s passing of this law as “overstepping its boundaries.” So in reality, no boundary was overstepped as the law reflected precedence from a previous genocide denial law and adherence to a legal EU framework.
