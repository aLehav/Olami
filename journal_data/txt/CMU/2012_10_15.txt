After the men’s tennis team’s slow start to the fall season, the Tartans finished in strong fashion. On Oct. 6, the Tartans took on Robert Morris University, defeating the Division-I school 9–0. The match was the perfect warm-up for the team’s match on Oct. 7 against No. 2 nationally ranked Amherst College. The Tartans defeated the Amherst Lord Jeffs in a close 5–4 match after coming back from a 3–0 deficit in doubles.
“Especially given the quality of the team we were competing against, it was hands down the most impressive comeback I’ve seen in my 10 years at Carnegie Mellon,” head coach Andrew Girard said. “To win five straight set singles matches against an opponent like Amherst shows that our team is capable of beating anyone this year. This very well may be the strongest and deepest team we’ve ever had. An outstanding way to wrap up our fall season.”
Despite rain in the forecast, the Tartans managed to fit in the match against Robert Morris University.
The Tartans started with doubles, and first off the court was No. 3 duo of sophomores Bryce Beisswanger and Christian Heaney-Secord, with a score of 8–3. Next off the court with a closer match was No. 1 doubles team of senior Duke Miller and sophomore William Duncan. Rounding out the 3–0 doubles sweep came from No. 2 doubles, the newly formed team of sophomore Thomas Cooper and first-year Kosuke Hasegawa, 9–8.
The Tartans took the court for singles and won every match. The first off the court was Heaney-Secord at No. 1 singles with a 6–2, 6–3 victory. Miller at No. 2 singles followed suit, winning 6–4, 6–4. Hasegawa won without dropping a single game at No. 3 singles. Duncan finished next, only dropping three games with a 6–2, 6–1 victory at No. 5 singles.
Senior Harsha Rao, No. 6 singles, took out his opponent 6–1, 6–0. No. 4 singles player senior Jooho Yu battled to a three-set tie-breaker, winning 7–6, 6–2, 10–6 to conclude the match.
The next day, the Tartans’ match was moved to an earlier time in an effort to avoid rain. They took the court against the Lord Jeffs starting with doubles. Despite the tough fight, the team lost all three doubles matches. The Lord Jeffs defeated No. 1 team of Miller and Duncan 8–5, and then took out No. 3 team of Beisswanger and Heaney-Secord 8–4. The Tartans’ No. 2 doubles team of Cooper and Hasegawa resisted the longest, but eventually fell 9–7.
The Tartans started singles play with a 3–0 deficit, but this did not stop them from winning the match. First-year Yuvraj Kumar led the Tartans with the team’s first victory of the day at No. 4 singles, winning 6–0, 6–4. Duncan followed suit, winning his match at No. 6 singles 6–1, 6–4. First-year Abhishek Alla kept the ball rolling with his match at No. 3 singles, winning 6–4, 6–4.
After a rain delay and a move indoors, the Tartans maintained the momentum. Heaney-Secord won at No. 1 singles 6–2, 6–3, increasing the lead to 4–3 and set up the team for a win. Miller lost at No. 2 singles bringing the match at 4–4. Hasegawa was the last Tartan on the court, and after a well-fought battle, won his match 7–5, 7–5, sealing the Tartan victory.
Assistant coach Mike Belmonte was proud of the team’s comeback.
“We certainly didn’t go into the match thinking we would lose all three doubles points, but we knew that we had the talent at every other spot to compete with Amherst, and our guys proved us right,” he said. “It was a very hard-fought and well-deserved comeback victory for us, and we are going to use it to launch ourselves into the spring season.”
The team will begin its spring season in February with its first match against the West Virginia Wesleyan College Bobcats. This match will be hosted by the Tartans at one of the team’s indoor facilities.

The Tartan men’s soccer team experienced its first conference loss, 3–2, in double overtime to the University of Rochester on Friday night, and defeated Case Western Reserve University yesterday 4–0.
Carnegie Mellon is now 9–2–1 overall and 2–1–1 in the University Athletic Association conferencce.
The University of Rochester Yellowjackets started the game aggressively and scored a goal within the first four minutes of play. 
The Tartans answered with a shot by junior midfielder Chris Wysocki that finished just above the goal in the 14th minute. Soon after, Rochester came back with another goal in the 21st minute to pull up to a 2–0 lead. The remainder of the first half included two unsuccessful shots by both teams.
Within the first 44 seconds of the second half, Tartans, junior midfielder Mike Ferraco scored his second goal of the season, bringing his team within one point of the lead.
For the following 15 minutes, the Tartans continued to get openings at the goal, but were just short of scoring until a second penalty kick by junior forward Max Tassano put the team back on the scoreboard.
The rest of regular play resulted in two unsuccessful shots by the Tartans and Yellowjackets.
Overtime began with a score of 2–2 and resulted in two shots from the Tartans, consisting of one shot from Wysocki that was saved by the Yellowjackets goalkeeper and a header from senior defender Alex Abedian that landed just wide of the goal.
In the second overtime period, the Tartans got another two shots, but neither connected with the net. With 2:19 remaining, the Yellowjackets scored the final goal, leaving the score 3–2.
“An unfortunate way to end an incredible comeback. We had them on their heels all second half and in [overtime], but couldn’t get that third goal. This game proved that even with a great group of guys like we have that there is still room for improvement. An early 2–0 deficit makes the game unnecessarily difficult,” Abedian said.
The Tartans will travel to Grove City to play the Grove City College Wolverines this Wednesday at 4 p.m.

The women’s soccer team continued to boost its conference success with a 1–0 win over the University of Rochester last Friday and a 3–1 victory over Case Western Reserve University yesterday.
The 24th ranked Tartans’ record improved to 9–1–2 overall and 3–1–0 in the University Athletic Association (UAA) conference as the University of Rochester Yellowjackets fell to a 0–3–0 UAA record.
The Tartans exhibited a strong offense, putting plenty of pressure on Rochester during the first half. The pressure culminated at the 33-minute mark when junior defender Rachel Contopoulos kicked the ball to first-year midfielder Carson Quiros, who headed the ball to senior forward Brianna Magill for a goal. The goal marked Magill’s third of the season, giving the Tartans a one-point advantage.
The second half was marked by impressive defense on both sides and strong offensive attempts by the Tartans. Senior Mitra Ebrahimi shot just too wide at the 51-minute mark, while junior forward Cecilia Zischkau shot a header that went just above the goalbox at the 68-minute mark. Contopoulos continued her efforts with numerous goal attempts as well.
The Tartans were able to maintain its advantage throughout the game with an all-around team effort.
“I am really proud of our team for stepping up each game to the challenge. We play each game as the most important one of the season and it is definitely paying off. With only four more UAA games, we have the motivation to keep outplaying our opponents and getting victories,” senior midfielder Stephanie Hare said.
The Tartans will travel to face Grove City College this Thursday in hopes of maintaining their national ranking and strong record.

Senior running back and captain of the Carnegie Mellon football team Jake Nardone injured his right knee earlier this season. He has been contemplating whether to redshirt the rest of the football season and come back next year to play one more season, or to pursue a career. Prior to his injury, Nardone received All-UAA honors twice, achieving First Team All-UAA as a sophomore and Second Team All-UAA as a junior. 
Nardone is majoring in business administration, with a track in finance. If he decides to graduate this year, he is interested in pursing a career in sales and trading. “The most rewarding part of being a CMU athlete is that you know you are one of the few people who can succeed both athletically and academically at one of the most challenging private universities in the country,” Nardone said.
Nardone’s injury occurred this season in the game against Catholic University. “I was playing with a sore hamstring. I was playing well, but right before halftime, I made a sharp cut to break away from a safety and I heard a sharp pop in my knee. I think that I was relying too much on my knee because of the hamstring injury,” he said.
The timetable for this type of injury is anywhere from seven to 12 months. “If I choose to play a redshirt senior year, I would be ready to play next season,” Nardone said.
Meanwhile, Nardone has limited mobility and is currently undergoing treatment on campus. “Every day I go to treatment in the athletic training room. Adam Hindes has been a tremendous help working me through the pain to get my knee back into playing condition. Also, two days a week, [physical therapists] from UPMC stop by to check my recovery status. It has been difficult so far, but I know that it is well worth it,” he said.
Nardone doesn’t want to miss out on spending time with the team. “The aspect of football that I love the most is the camaraderie within the locker room. No matter what, I know that being with the guys is going to lift my spirits,” he said.
Despite being injured, Nardone has been remained active on the team. “I just show up with the same positive attitude that I always have,” he said. “The challenges you face in life are never the same, but the mindset you take to conquer them should never falter. That is why I am able to stay positive.”
“When thinking about Jake, not just one aspect stands out from the rest of who he is as a person,” senior outside linebacker Owen Parker said. “It is quite perplexing because as a player, captain, leader, and teammate, he is what I consider to be the cream of the crop. When I look back on my college experience, I without hesitation believe he is the most genuine and caring person I have met both on and off the field.”
One way Nardone stays active within the team is by setting goals for himself and his teammates. “The goal for myself is to continue to be a strong leader through the injury process,” Nardone said. “It is so difficult as a captain to not be out there every day on the field, but I can still show the guys that my heart is still with the team and that we have come this far together, that we have so much more to work for.” 
“My goal for the team is for each member to remember that they are a part of something bigger than themselves and to continue to work hard and improve everyday,” he added. “I know that if this team is able to do that the amount of success we will have in wins will speak for itself.”
Whether Nardone decides to redshirt and stay for another year or not, he feels that “football has been a huge part of my experience at CMU. The sport has helped me stay focused through the academic rigors, and it has also led to countless great friendships that I will take with me for the rest of my life.”
“I just want to thank everyone that has reached out to me and encouraged me through the injury and rehab process, because it has made such a difference to see that people care about your well-being,” he said.

The Carnegie Mellon Athletics website recently underwent a major overhaul. The site was given a complete facelift with larger photos and a greater emphasis on fan interaction. The site was introduced to Carnegie Mellon on Sept. 28.
The athletics department is thrilled by the new  website. Director of Athletics Susan Bassett said, “Our Athletics Communication staff conducted an excellent process including athletics department staff and colleagues from across campus to produce a website that reflects the department vision and mission.”
According to Associate Director of Athletics Josh Centor, the site has been redesigned to showcase Carnegie Mellon athletes “on and off the field of play.” 
The new Fan Zone button links users to a page containing stories about athlete and alumni activities outside their sport in addition to the Captain’s Chair section, which showcases a team captain’s experiences with Tartan athletics and their leadership experiences.
Fans can now easily find multiple sports calendars, results, and live webcasting statistics to better follow sporting events and games, even if they cannot be there in person. The new website has the opportunity for more “dynamic content,” Centor said.
While the website has undergone stylistic and organizational redesign, much of the content is the same. The human interest stories about the athletes and alumni and the Captain’s Chair were on the previous site, but were harder to locate. Junior biological studies and Russian histories double major and Science and Humanities Scholar Brendan MacNabb plays on the baseball team and writes the recaps of the games, so he often uses the athletics website. “While the site looks much better stylistically, some of the content is still lacking,” he said
This website is “a great vehicle to tell the story of some fantastic men and women,” Centor said. “We are thrilled with the redesign.”

The media in New York is unlike any other. It’s more aggressive than most, and is easily the most critical with failures and shortcomings put under a microscope.
Just ask New York Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez and New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez.
Last week, both athletes were reviled in the Big Apple. While their inability to perform anywhere close to professional level is cause for grievance, the New York media has had a momentous effect on the national opinion of these two athletes.
In the midst of a tightly contested American League Divisional Series against the Baltimore Orioles, Rodriguez is batting an appalling two for 15, with nine strikeouts. He has struck out at least twice in every playoff game this season. For a guy who is paid about $27.5 million a year for his offense, any criticism is credible.
Sanchez has been consistently one of the worst players, playing one of the most important positions on what should be one of the better teams in the National Football League. His 66.6 passer rating and six interceptions are hellish statistics, to say the least, and he’s led his team to a subpar 2–3 start. As if playing poorly in New York wasn’t enough, the polarizing and enigmatic quarterback, Tim Tebow, remains his backup and the favored choice of New York fans.
Playing in New York is a much bigger beast than playing anywhere else. We have seen good athletes come to New York and choke under the heavy weight of the big media market. Pitcher A.J. Burnett was pretty good as a Florida Marlin and a Toronto Blue Jay before coming to the Yankees.
But, in New York, he was 34–35 and never had an earned run average (ERA) below four; in two of his three seasons in New York, he had an ERA over five.
New York Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony continues to be criticized for being unable to lift his team to the level of championship contention, despite putting up similar numbers to what he was able to do as a Denver Nugget. The cases of Burnett and Anthony illustrate two different scenarios: simply being unable to perform with the New York-sized weight on your shoulders and being unable to live up to unrealistic expectations.
During Rodriguez’s horrible playoff performance — something that has happened consistently in his time as a Yankee — the columnists and journalists have fed like vultures on his failures. 
Articles condemning Rodriguez for not being completely committed to the team’s success or ordering manager Joe Girardi to bump Rodriguez down in the batting order are in vast supply.
For Sanchez, it has been no better. Articles bombarded the news questioning when Tebow would unseat Sanchez as the Jets’ starting quarterback. As head coach Rex Ryan continues to make Sanchez his starter, the media has continued to balloon the attacks to start the less skilled Tebow over the struggling quarterback.
But Sanchez’s performance hasn’t been significantly worse than his career numbers.
When you look at football teams in New York, it is hard to believe — based on the media coverage — that the New York Giants had just won the Superbowl.
Quarterback Eli Manning, fresh off winning the Superbowl MVP, is the third most talked about quarterback in New York behind Sanchez and Tebow.
For some, the pressure of New York is too much to handle. Maybe Sanchez would be better suited in a smaller market. Perhaps the expectations for him are just too high, and the numbers he puts up will attract less criticism in a different city. 
We know Rodriguez can bring it: His offensive numbers are some of the best the MLB has ever seen. But is the weight of 27 World Series victories too much pressure? He has consistently underperformed in the playoffs as a Yankee.
The media is a vicious monster, and there is none more vicious than a writer in New York. But the media is a public service, and its aggressiveness parallels its fans.
There is no escaping that monster in New York because all they expect in the Big Apple is championship success.

Jeremy Zerechak, an award-winning filmmaker from Pittsburgh, stopped by Carnegie Mellon CyLab last Friday to talk about his new documentary Code 2600. As part of a panel discussion led by Lorrie Cranor, associate professor of computer science and engineering and public policy, Zerechak talked about the major themes of the film, which mostly revolve around hacking, cybersecurity, and privacy. Two screenings of Code 2600, also sponsored by CyLab, were shown at McConomy Auditorium later that day.
After garnering success with his critically acclaimed 2008 war documentary Land of Confusion, Zerechak explained how a later encounter with an intrusion detection specialist sparked his interest about hacking and cybersecurity.
“I decided to go ahead and do extensive research into that story,” Zerechak said. “What I found was a history that was rich and untold, and a story of an expansive world that I felt was very underrepresented.”
Zerechak’s documentary begins by touching on the “phone phreaks” of the ’60s and ’70s, who would employ various techniques to leverage the telecommunications systems in place at the time. Among the most popular of these techniques was one that involved using a hobbyist contraption called a blue box to make free long-distance phone calls.
A phone phreak would place the blue box next to the mouthpiece of a telephone and dial a long-distance telephone number on the blue box’s keypad. The blue box would then generate corresponding 2600 Hertz tones — hence the film’s name — and trick the long-distance dialing systems into routing the call. With a 10-minute phone call from San Francisco to New York costing the equivalent of $55 today, these widespread “phreaking” techniques cost telecommunications companies fortunes at the time.
As this was one of the earliest struggles between tech corporations and hackers, panel member Nicolas Christin, associate director of the Information Networking Institute and CyLab senior systems scientist, drew some comparisons between that scenario and the piracy issues plaguing the digital entertainment industry today.
“In the ’60s, phone calls were expensive and people didn’t want to spend money, [so] they developed early ingenious technology to circumvent that,” he said. “Now if you fast-forward to, say, today, movies, movie rentals are very expensive, and people don’t want to spend that money.... The root of the problem is still the same today. The technology has changed, but ultimately it’s about economics.”
The film also described many current cybersecurity issues. It featured a few “white hats” — hackers who exploit systems for benign purposes, such as revealing security flaws to a company — explaining various methods they’ve used to obtain confidential information.
Some were able to extract account passwords, credit card numbers, social security numbers, and other types of sensitive data by cracking poor wireless encryption schemes or by inconspicuously acquiring such data at public wireless access points. Others tricked unsuspecting users into plugging flash drives full of hidden, harmful programs into their computers.
Jeff Moss, founder of the hacking conferences Black Hat and DEFCON, demonstrated a terminal program called Metasploit that he was able to use to gain access to the core system files on a Windows machine. The punch line this time? He was doing it all wirelessly from his jailbroken iPhone. 
Obviously, tools like these falling into the hands of “black hats” — those who exploit systems for malicious purposes — make them powerful opponents to the financial security of the typically unprepared consumer engaging in online transactions.
“Cyber crime is really taking over,” said panel member Norman Sadeh, professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon. “From people identifying exploits, to people enabling these exploits, to people controlling botnets and making these botnets available, there’s an entire black economy that has developed.... It has made it easier for people to launch attacks on a much larger scale than what was previously possible.”
Yet another dimension that Code 2600 ambitiously tries to address is the question, “Is privacy dead?” In an age where people seem willing to publicize more of their private information to social networks like Twitter and Facebook to promote their social status, some like world-class cryptographer and security commentator Bruce Schneier are questioning whether this really is the best course of action for our society.
“There’s a common myth that privacy is about something to hide,” Schneier says in the documentary. “ ‘I don’t have anything to hide, so I don’t need privacy.’ But you know that’s not true. You don’t have any[thing] to hide when you sing in the shower or write a love letter and then tear it up. Privacy is about us as individuals; it’s about our ability to be who we are, without necessarily telling everybody.... It’s not about hiding, it’s about personal dignity.”
“When you use a bookseller like Amazon.com,” adds Jennifer Granick, director of civil liberties at Stanford University, in the film, “they’re keeping information about not only books you buy and where your house is that they have to ship the books to, but about what books you brag [about]. All of that information gets collected and stored.... This is some of the most private kinds of information: what books you’re interested in [and] what you search on Google.... Think about how you would feel if someone could get access to what you were searching for. It’s basically what you’re thinking ... some of the most intimate, personal information that’s out there.”

Two big data research projects here at Carnegie Mellon received a combined total of over $1.7 million from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) last week.
Aarti Singh and Christos Faloutsos, the principal investigators of the two big data projects at Carnegie Mellon, received these grants as a result of the NSF-NIH 2012 Big Data Research and Development Initiative Launch. Grants, totaling $15 million, were awarded to eight big data projects throughout the country that focus on unique aspects of the problems present in big data.
But what is big data, and why is it important?
As society and technology’s relationship matures and becomes increasingly complex, scientists and engineers find themselves faced with a rapidly growing phenomenon: big data. As it implies, the phrase describes any data set that is very, very large. But as Suzi Iacono, senior science adviser at the NSF, described in the grants’ press release, “Big data is characterized not only by the enormous volume or the velocity of its generation, but also by the heterogeneity, diversity, and complexity of the data.”
That is to say, all of our twitter posts, satellite data, purchases, and medical records generate a lot of data: 2.5 quintillion — that’s a 1 followed by 18 zeros — bytes of data a day. There is a current need for innovative ways to process it all.
One aspect of big data that makes it so complex is its high dimensional nature. In a 2D system, x causes y and the relationship can be described by a function. But when more variables are added to the system, there are not only more data and data types that the variables represent, but the relationship that describes the data set is also harder to determine.
One way to sort through this data is by data mining, a technique that combines computer science and statistics. Both Singh’s and Faloutsos’ research focus on improving current data mining methods and applications.
Singh, an assistant professor in machine learning, received $820,000. She works with Timothy Verstynen, an assistant professor of psychology, and Barnabás Póczos, a postdoctoral fellow in machine learning. Together, they are the principal investigators for research that runs out of the Auton Lab, part of Carnegie Mellon’s computer science department.
According to its website, the lab wants to study “how to efficiently estimate certain important functionals of high-dimensional distributions ... and use these estimators in machine learning algorithms.” By doing so, the researchers can further the high-dimensional challenge of mapping the brain’s billions and trillions of neurons and neural networks. If their research is successful, not only can it be applied to just neuroimaging data analysis, but also to “other scientific fields where collective behavior of a population is important.”
Faloutsos’ research focuses on the big data associated with language processing. Faloutsos teaches in the machine learning department and works with Tom Mitchell, also in the department, and Nikolaos Sidiropoulos of the University of Minnesota. They work on graph mining groups of words, or “strings,” in a matrix to better understand language processing.
Their data contains millions of triplets that house three strings with a subject-verb-object relationship, such as the relationship between the strings “Obama,” “is the President,” and “of the United States of America.” With enough similar data, Faloutsos explained, the computer can extrapolate from “David Cameron,” “prime minister,” and “U.K.” that Cameron is probably a politician. And when it’s extended to “Ben Roethlisberger,” “quarterback,” and “Steelers,” the computer automatically builds another layer and groups Roethlisberger with other people of leadership. Mitchell calls this research project the Never Ending Language Learner (NELL).
Related to NELL and included in the NSF grant is a project in neurolinguistics that attempts to understand how human brains process language. The researchers use a functional MRI to view how the brain responds to a word, then try to predict how the brain will process other words, studying how those words relate to one another. The data associated with this research “will force us to develop new algorithms or to rethink algorithms and new theories that help us analyze new data sets that were almost impossible to analyze before,” Faloutsos said.

“Science is best learned when presented in story form.”
Such is Sam Kean’s point of view on the explanation of scientific knowledge. The science writer gave a lecture, titled “The Disappearing Spoon,” to a crowd of about 100 in Gregg Hall last Thursday.
Kean, an author of two national best-selling books, The Disappearing Spoon and The Violinist’s Thumb, focused his talk on the little-known back-stories of some of the elements on the periodic table. He began the lecture by tying his early interest in science to his mother’s mercury thermometer. Calling mercury the “most fascinating substance I’ve ever seen,” Kean explained how his curiosity while watching his mother clean up a broken thermometer turned into a full-fledged obsession with chemistry and the people behind the discoveries.
He delved into the story of Dr. Benjamin Rush, a physician who created tablets full of mercury as a way (he thought) to cure illness. Kean explained that the doctor gave Lewis and Clark over 600 of these tablets — known for their intense laxative effect — and that researchers can even determine some locations the explorers visited due to the high levels of mercury in the soil.
For Kean, these obscure tidbits of information are the most interesting ways to learn about science. He even noted that aluminum had the “classic narrative of a story,” following the element’s history from obscure beginnings as an unusable metal, its rising action to acclaim among royalty, its climax at the peak of manufacturing, and its eventual crash to relative worthlessness.
Kean read two excerpts from The Disappearing Spoon, one focusing on the political tensions surrounding the element molybdenum and the other on the work of scientist George de Hevesy. Kean said that he wanted his book to not only talk about the history of the elements, but to also talk about “some of the scientists with really big personalities.”
Kean utilized his story-telling skills throughout the lecture to interweave well-known historical events with the narratives of scientists such as Hevesy and James Seaborg. He gave an account of how Hevesy deceived Nazi soldiers looking for a colleague’s illegally exported Nobel Prize by melting the gold medal into an unassuming flask; the Germans never found it and the Nobel committee recast it afterward.
The students, professors, and other members of the Carnegie Mellon community in attendance were receptive to Kean’s humor and captivating presentation. 
For some, his lecture spoke of the importance of effective and interesting communication of science.
“As a society we certainly would benefit from a more scientifically-educated and engaged citizenry, and books like this are a terrific mechanism towards that end,” Karen Stump, director of the department of chemistry’s undergraduate Studies and laboratories, said via email.
Kean’s “science history romp” exposes the faces behind the periodic table, which he calls “the most precious real estate in all of science.” It’s these stories, people, and ideas that make science so fascinating to him.
“We all know about the science of the periodic table... it’s fundamental. But the periodic table means more to that; it’s a story book, it’s a trove, with our passions stored within it,” he said.

In recent decades, significant advances in particle physics have been made through experiments conducted by particle accelerators. While the most well-known and talked about accelerator is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), there are many other accelerators around the world, including the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider (BEPC) and the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Virginia — all of which Carnegie Mellon professors have worked with. 
The LHC is a gigantic particle accelerator that lies 100 meters underground between the borders of Switzerland and France. It accelerates protons or lead ions inside its circular track, which then collide head-on at high energy levels. The particles created by these collisions are then analyzed in detectors.
“Carnegie Mellon has been involved in the design and construction of the CMS,” said physics professor Helmut Vogel, one of several faculty members working with the LHC, in reference to the Compact Muon Solenoid detector. “We also helped write the software and build part of the hardware. We are now involved in data analysis.”
One of the main goals of the LHC is to detect the elusive Higgs boson, a particle theorized to give other particles mass. However, many of the particles that the LHC seeks to discover, including the Higgs, have lifespans that are much too short to leave tracks in the detectors. Instead, scientists use simulations to predict the decay products of such particles, and look for these in the detectors.
“We have found something that in some ways behaves like the predictions for the Higgs, although we don’t have the amount of data yet to tell with high precision,” Vogel said. Further research supporting this newly discovered Higgs-like particle would prove that the current model of how the world works is correct. 
Meanwhile, a different type of particle physics experiment is going on at the BEPC in China. While the work being done at the LHC is referred to as the “energy frontier,” the BEPC focuses more on the “intensity frontier.” Instead of searching for the existence of undetected particles, precision measurements of particular known particles are studied to test how well their behavior agrees with theoretical models.
“Electron-positron collisions are used to produce various bound states of charm quarks,” wrote Carnegie Mellon physics professor Roy Briere, who collaborates with the BEPC, in his research statement. Data from this collider will answer important questions, such as the dominance of matter over antimatter in the universe. 
In Virginia, the Jefferson Lab is probing the behavior of quarks. Michael Darcy, a junior physics major who interned with the lab over the summer, described the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility, the lab’s particle accelerator: “It accelerates electrons with superconducting radio-frequency cavities around a racetrack-shaped tunnel.”
“Jefferson Labs currently has three running experimental stations called Hall A, B, and C,” he said, describing the lab. “Electrons from the beamline can be split into these three different rooms and each room has a different kind of particle detector in it.” A fourth hall is currently under construction and will be used to perform the GlueX experiment, for which physics professor Curtis Meyer is the spokesperson. GlueX aims to discover exotic mesons — a postulated but yet-undiscovered type of meson made of two quarks and two anti-quarks. 
So why is it important to spend time and money on these immense projects? Vogel gave two reasons.
The first is cultural: “What is the benefit of knowing the Earth revolves around the sun and not the other way around? It is knowledge that contributes to the culture of society. Even if it has no direct impact on building a better microwave, or better cars.... It is valuable knowledge.” 
His second reason is more practical for those seeking a career: “Particle accelerators are immensely complicated apparatuses that take people with very sophisticated skills to build. These experiments are training a new generation of people with enormous skills that are very marketable, and very sought after, in many fields.”

Nobel Prize goes to two American chemists
Scientists Robert Lefkowitz and Brian Kobilka received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for interpreting how the human body senses and responds to signals from the outside world. Their discovery, including the detection of receptor molecules between adrenaline and cells, has provided an intricate understanding of the human body and has aided greatly in drug development. 
According to Sven Lidin of the Royal Swedish Academy, the receptors discovered by Lefkowitz and Kobilka “are the target of half of all drugs.” Lefkowitz, a medical professor at Duke University and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute researcher, and Kobilka, a medical professor at Stanford University, will share the $1.2 million.

Researchers explore black hole energy blasts
A team of astrophysicists may have unlocked the mystery of what makes black holes spew energy back out. Black holes have a gravitational pull so strong that they will consume anything near them, and they have been observed to spew out energy jets from previously-consumed matter.
Astrophysicists at the Haystack Observatory and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology used radio telescopes to observe a jet spewing from a black hole in a galaxy about 54 million light- years away. The energy jet came from near the innermost edge of the accretion disk, the last point at which the matter can move in a constant orbit. The team has speculated that the blasts occur because magnetic fields within the orbiting material in the hole become twisted and carry energy away through an electromagnetic blast.

Massive galaxies often collide with each other
Astronomers at the University of Utah found evidence of repeated collisions between massive galaxies. The galaxies, which contain close to a trillion stars, are the end result of the merging of many smaller galaxies. Astronomers have observed that they have become denser at the center over time, which can only occur when two galaxies of similar size collide.
“If you have two roughly comparable galaxies and they are on a collision course, each one penetrates more toward the center of the other, so more mass ends up in the center,” explained Adam Bolton, the principal author of the study. The study is a joint effort between the University of Utah, The Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and 20 other research institutes worldwide.

New iPhone app able to monitor ear infections
Researchers at Georgia Tech and Emory University have developed the “Remotoscope.” It makes the iPhone function as an otoscope, the instrument doctors use to check their patients’ ears. The idea behind the app is to enable parents to regularly take pictures of their child’s ear and send the images to pediatricians so they can supervise infections. 
It functions by putting a scope over the phone’s camera lens, facilitating capturing images of the ear canal, and magnifying the images. The app is currently undergoing clinical trials, with the hope that the results may be published by the end of the year.

Eyeball of unknown species found on Florida shore
While walking on Pompano Beach, Fla., Gino Covacci stumbled across what he claimed was “the biggest eyeball he had ever seen.” According to Covacci, the eyeball seemed to have recently been separated from the creature it belonged to, as it was bleeding when discovered.
He turned the eyeball over to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, which has preserved it in formaldehyde to observe it further. So far, the most likely source of the eyeball seems to be a large fish, such as a swordfish. However, there is not yet certainty as to what creature it belonged to.

Kellogg’s cereal may contain metal fragments
Kellogg has issued a recall on its product, Mini-Wheats, because the cereal may contain metal fragments. The company has defended itself, claiming to have had a thorough metal detection program, using magnets and metal detection devices. “We are working with our metal detector supplier to understand why the equipment did not detect the mesh fragments,” Kellogg’s officials explained through an online statement. No injuries or incidences have been reported

While I was watching the Cooking Channel a few weeks ago, an advertisement came on for Maruchan Ramen Noodles that showed a white, suburban, middle-class family happily enjoying prepackaged noodle products together. I rolled my eyes; with the family’s over-enthusiastic responses to ramen aside, it seemed unlikely that that family represented Maruchan’s main customer base. At a mere 40 cents a package at Giant Eagle, ramen noodles are best known for being a standard staple of any broke (or kitchen-fearing) college student’s diet, eaten more out of necessity than out of genuine enjoyment.
The commercial got me thinking, though, about ramen noodles’ culinary potential. While the noodles and accompanying flavor packets may be unexciting on their own, they are straightforward enough to serve as excellent building blocks for other recipes that are more nutritious and interesting.
My culinary accomplice, Xuexia Jiang, and I thus set out to use ramen in as wide of a variety of meals as possible, and we found that ramen noodles can be incorporated into plenty of different recipes for every meal. There are literally hundreds of recipes on the internet involving ramen noodles, but our sampling of ramen-related culinary experiments proves that the noodles can be consumed for any meal and taste delicious in the process.
Ramen Egg Scramble
Ramen for breakfast sounds suspect, but the noodles work surprisingly well in this dish. Since ramen noodles are fairly flavorless on their own and have a nondescript texture, they make for a good, filling ingredient. In this recipe, for instance, one can turn three eggs and a handful of vegetables and cheese into a filling dish that can easily satisfy two people.
Recipe
Adapted from indochinekitchen.com
1/2 pack chicken-flavored instant ramen noodles
1 tbsp butter
2 tbsp onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, halved (or any other vegetables of your choice)
3 eggs, beaten with 2 tablespoons of water and a pinch of salt
1/4 cup cheese
Salsa
Drop half of the package of ramen noodles into boiling water. Cook for four minutes, or according to package instructions.
Drain water and toss in instant powdered stock included in the package. Mix well with a fork.
Melt butter in a pan over medium heat. Quickly cook chopped onions for two minutes, or until they are translucent. Add cherry tomatoes (or other vegetables) and cook for another minute.
Add noodles into the pan and mix well with the other ingredients. Cook for another two minutes.
Spread noodles and tomatoes evenly across the pan. Add egg mixture and cook for one minute.
Add cheese on top, turn down heat slightly, and cook for approximately three more minutes, stirring occasionally.
Top with salsa and serve.
Ramen Skillet Pizza
This recipe is not a perfect replica of pizza. If you have a craving and the only cure is pizza, this dish probably will not suffice, as it still tastes like noodles rather than pizza crust.
However, if you’re just in need of some carbs drowned in sauce and cheese, ramen pizza can get the job done. The noodles take on a nice grilled flavor when cooked in the pan, and the more toppings you add, the easier it is to forget that the “crust” is actually just 80 cents’ worth of Japanese noodles.
Recipe
Adapted from womansday.com
2 packages ramen, any flavor
1 tbsp olive oil
1/2 cup spaghetti sauce (adjust as desired)
4 oz mozzarella cheese, shredded
1/2 tsp dried oregano, crumbled
Other pizza toppings, as desired
Heat broiler. Bring water to boil in a large pot.
Add noodles and cook, stirring occasionally, for three minutes or until tender. Drain in a colander.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet. When hot, add noodles and press evenly to cover bottom of pan. Cook on medium-high heat for four minutes or until browned underneath.
Spread sauce over noodles, then sprinkle with cheese, oregano, and other toppings.
If the skillet handle is plastic or wood, wrap it in a double layer of foil to protect it from scorching. Broil four to five inches from heat source for two minutes, or until top is bubbly and cheese starts to brown.
Let cool about five minutes before cutting to serve.
Ramen Stir Fry
Stir fry is a very flexible and easy dish. You can buy frozen packages of premixed stir fry vegetables, or you can just use whatever combination of vegetables and meat you happen to have on hand.
Recipe
1 package of Oriental-flavored ramen noodles
Cooking oil (olive, vegetable, or canola all work)
Soy sauce
Assorted vegetables for stir fry
Pour a small amount of oil onto the bottom of a frying pan or wok and heat pan.
Add vegetables and fry; cook off most of the water.
At the same time, boil a pot of water. Add ramen and boil until noodles are pliable.
Place ramen noodles into the same pan as vegetables and add a dash of soy sauce, the package of Oriental seasoning, and a little more oil.
Stir briefly, then take off heat. Add salt and pepper.
Chocolate Peanut Butter Munchies
Ramen noodles for dessert sounds even more doubtful than ramen for breakfast does. However, the uncooked noodles in this recipe work as a crunchy complement to peanut butter and chocolate. If you’re craving some peanut butter and chocolate and don’t want to just eat peanut butter and chocolate syrup straight off a spoon, this is a surprisingly tasty way to satisfy your craving.
Recipe
Adapted from budget101.com
1 pack instant ramen noodles, any flavor
1 1/2 cups chocolate (chocolate chips, Hershey’s bars, etc.)
1/3 cup creamy peanut butter
In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave chocolate in 30-second intervals until melted, stirring in between.
Stir in peanut butter with melted chocolate.
Carefully break uncooked ramen into bite-sized chunks. Be careful not to crumble noodles.
Spread chocolate peanut butter mix over each of the noodle chunks, covering each well.
Refrigerate for 10 minutes, or until chocolate mix has completely hardened.

The perfect exotic escape from midterm stress lies not across the ocean, but simply across campus in the Tropical Forest India exhibit at Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens.
According to the exhibition website, Tropical Forest India was exhaustively researched and planned for over a year by Assistant Curator of Horticulture Ben Dunigan and interpretive specialist Jordyn Melino, and this extensive research shows in the final product. The exhibit is more than just a collection of plants: It’s a green teleporter of flora and fauna that whisks you away to the forests of India.
Cheery impatiens are dotted throughout, accompanied by tea plants. Palms with gigantic leaves stand over hundreds of plant varieties. The impossibly thick vegetation is swathed in fog from a fog machine. A “river” flows through the room that houses the exhibit, lined with dainty purple blooms and vibrant green leaves.
The exhibit goes beyond just displaying tropical plants and some dirt, incorporating interesting cultural tidbits and extra displays throughout. Among these are waterfalls, the river, and a quaint Indian bazaar that displays different varieties of teas and spices native to the country. Also featured is a collection of field research that highlights the work of botanists around the world, an outpost that features the medicinal uses of the plants and, of course, as much tropical forest as can be packed into one room in Pittsburgh.
The vast array of species spills over from the carefully designed beds onto the winding pathway, truly transforming the room into a little slice of paradise. Immediately upon walking through the doorway — which is decorated with an Indian temple façade — visitors experience a sense of peace and tranquility mixed with a dose of ancient wisdom. Plants labeled with tags that beg, “Smell me, I’m fragrant!” are the first to welcome visitors with their powerful and sweet scent, setting the vibe for the entire exhibit. At the charming Indian bazaar just down the path from the waterfall, samples of tea and spices create an aromatic bouquet.
Besides the pleasant scents and the explosion of exotic flora, the exhibit is packed with signposts that feature interesting facts about the country, its culture, and its native plants. The Ayurvedic healing garden and outpost highlight the interwoven histories of the religious culture and medicinal uses of the plants growing in the exhibit. It’s interesting and educational to browse the easy-to-ingest information presented in a fun, original way, and to find out how many uses the Indian culture has for the plants that surround it.
A unique Pittsburgh gem, Phipps is a wonderful escape that mesmerizes and immediately calms. There’s something about being surrounded by lush greenery that feels cleansing and healthy. Take advantage of this amazing place: It’s just across Flagstaff Hill, it’s free for Carnegie Mellon students, and it’s open until 10 p.m. on Friday nights.

As part of the Carol Brown Lecture Series, Gordon Hutner spoke last Thursday in Rangos Hall on “Writing the Literary History of the 21st Century: A Brief Introduction.” Hutner, a professor of American literature at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has been widely published in the field of literary history and is the founding editor of the journal American Literary History.
Hutner’s most recent book, titled What America Read: Taste, Class and the Novel 1920 – 1960, examines how the literary works remembered by academia may not be the ones that were most pertinent to the general reading public. The novels that were forgotten were those that pertained mostly to middle-class values — novels that he described as “literature not of the great, but of the pretty good.” Hutner said the “critical memory” of academia is assigning less value to “middle-brow” works, and instead favoring bourgeois values. This work led Hutner to consider the current literary climate.
Hutner means to create a system of reviewing novels that avoids the mistakes of previous generations of academics. It was intimidating for him to decide how to start. Initially, he considered doing close readings of a handful of key novels, but decided that this method would not be representative enough of the century as a whole.
Instead, he gathered prize-winning novels — works that had already earned accolades and had value according to the prize panels. The idea of this method provoked murmurs of assent from the audience. However, he discovered that the panels were almost exclusively comprised of other novelists. He wittily described it as “pigs giving reviews about bacon.” But this realization led him to wonder why there aren’t more academics involved in evaluating literature.
The most interesting part of Hutner’s lecture was his response to the problem, “Who is paying attention?” He argued that there is a lack of literary criticism, which is replaced by reviews in newspapers and magazines. Hutner speculates that this lack of criticism results from the shrinking of print culture, the close relationships between book publishers and reviewers, and the fact that the spirit of argument has been replaced with the habit of praising the strong and ignoring the weak. His focus on the evolution of literary reviews gave context and lent interest to his topic.
Hutner recommended that academics get back into the criticism game to alleviate this issue. English professors need to read modern works and evaluate them seriously in order to create a true history of the 21st-century novel — one that is more representative of the works being written as a whole and those that are more relevant to the readers of the time period. During the Q & A after the lecture, there was some debate as to whether or not professors can be expected to do this. Hutner said that it should be included in the job description, and while this answer may not have convinced the questioner, it reinforced Hutner’s position.
Hutner realizes that his solution is not foolproof, and acknowledged that the books that stand up to the test of time may be the ones by “less heralded” authors, or even “books I haven’t heard of yet.” The goal of Hutner’s project is a noble one, and addresses the need for a more complete literary history of the novels that address the problems of the time, be they middle-class ethics, race and gender issues, or other everyday topics. He presented his ideas in a fashion that was both engaging and informative, bringing life to the subject. There are many works worth preserving, and the consensus in the room was that there needs to be action to make that happen.

Transcendental Youth is no sonic revolution for the Mountain Goats. But then, who was really looking for one? After 20 years of being led by vocalist, lyricist, guitarist, and keyboardist John Darnielle, the Mountain Goats have established a predictable but strongly effective sound.
Every song in the new album sounds familiar without sounding rehashed, much like an old friend’s new escapades showing up on your Facebook feed. But sonic atmosphere is not the soul of the Mountain Goats’ music; it is the lyrics that truly define the band’s musical accomplishments. The Mountain Goats’ musical output is much like the bibliography of a well-established, prodigious author: linguistic magic delivered in crisp packaging.
While Transcendental Youth won’t sway any of the band’s detractors, it is an excellent listen for both veteran fans and for those who have never heard of the band. Continuing in the trend of more recent Mountain Goats albums, Darnielle is supported by bassist Peter Hughes and drummer John Wurster (better known for his work with Superchunk). The band creates sounds that complement Darnielle’s lyrics perfectly, whether it is the almost low-fidelity crunch that recalls the more visceral work of early Mountain Goats on “Amy aka Spent Gladiator 1,” or the propulsive upbeat bassline and horn lines of the album’s first single “Cry for Judas,” which belies the hopelessness of the lyrics.
But the instrumentation’s function is really just as a complement to the voice. In this case, that’s totally fine, because if you’re listening to an album made by the Mountain Goats, you’re listening in order to hear Darnielle’s singing.
And, boy, does Darnielle deliver. The singing is drenched in urgency, toeing the line between control and chaos that Darnielle has perfected. Without even taking the lyrics into consideration, Transcendental Youth is enjoyable to listen to, filled with both upbeat anthems seemingly crafted for long road trips and introspective, emotionally devastating monologues.
What makes this album so beautifully devastating, however, is the songwriting. Darnielle is an incredibly gifted lyricist who is capable of both vivid imagery (“When the men emerge with rifles from the haystack / Everybody looks surprised / Like the mice in the forgotten grain / Way up on the top shelf” on “Spent Gladiator 2”) and smart poetic wordplay (“Dream of maybe waking up someday / And wanting you less than I do / This is a dream though / It’s never gonna come true” on “Night Light”).
The album is loosely themed on self-destruction and the constant struggle for salvation and hope. While an album from a more self-conscious band may have been overly trite, the pure ferocity with which the band delivers its sound makes empathizing with the characters in Transcendental Youth a near inevitability. It is the band’s ability to provoke empathy that allows the Mountain Goats to continue creating such brilliance release after release. For listeners who have become jaded by a music industry consumed with irony and self-awareness, Transcendental Youth is a welcome beacon of raw, controlled power.

Halcyon, Ellie Goulding’s second album, is not bad. But it isn’t particularly great, either.
Goulding’s debut, Lights, came out in 2010 to critical acclaim and widespread popularity in both the United Kingdom and the U.S. Lights was extremely successful and featured songs such as the titular track “Lights,” “Starry Eyed,” and “Your Song.” Her debut was a little indie and a little electropop, and those two elements blended seamlessly, along with Goulding’s vocals, to create a good collection of songs.
Halcyon tries to mix up that old formula a little bit, and Goulding should be commended for that. Too often, musicians lean on their old successes for fear of trying something new. Goulding moved away from the indie flavor of her first album, and Halcyon is much more deeply rooted in a pop and synthetic sound.
Unfortunately, Goulding’s voice is perhaps better suited to the first genre. Too many wordless vocals clash with electronic upbeat instrumentals, which creates a jarring juxtaposition in several of the album’s songs. “Don’t Say A Word,” the first track of the album, tries just a little too hard to be ethereal and consequently falls short. In the track “Atlantis,” Goulding’s voice is too high and too slow, and “Dead in the Water” is too sparse on the instrumentals. Goulding tries to use the lack of instruments to complement her vocals, but the attempt flops somewhat awkwardly.
This album repeatedly relies too much on her voice, perhaps copying the style of the hugely successful Florence Welch of Florence + the Machine. When Florence + the Machine chooses to fall back on vocals, the technique works, because Welch has an incredibly strong voice. Goulding has an absolutely lovely voice, but it’s not strong enough to carry this particular album, especially because she competes with her own instrumentals at times.
That being said, Halcyon is not all bad. Both “Only You” and “I Need Your Love” have the catchy strangeness that Goulding was going for in the whole album. “Figure 8” blends Goulding’s voice with the electropop accompaniment effectively. She is still a talented artist with a beautiful voice; the songs on her second album just do not showcase those talents as effectively as her first album did. Her songs might also exhibit her talents better if she were to choose more diverse subject matter; most of her songs detail the trials and tribulations of her love life.
The problem in Halcyon is that none of its songs has the same simple beauty as “Lights” or “Starry Eyed.” Part of what made Goulding so popular was the simplicity of her early works: The songs were not complex, but they were alluring. While not all of the songs in her debut album were perfect, they all smoothly maintained that simplicity; none of them sounded overworked. Halcyon, with its heavy use of electronic sound, has somehow lost that simple elegance. It’s worth a listen, but it’s not Lights.

A lot of people are going to hate The Casual Vacancy. J.K. Rowling’s first novel for adults is bleak, dry, and decidedly without magic. But it’s also powerful, and to anyone with a stomach for sordidness, it has the potential to be a rewarding read.
The Casual Vacancy tells the story of Pagford — a small, well-to-do British town that has been saddled with an impoverished housing development called the Fields for 60 years. Many Pagford residents would like nothing more than to hand the Fields over to the neighboring city of Yarvil, and when parish councilor and Fields advocate Barry Fairbrother dies suddenly, leaving council members with the titular “casual vacancy,” they see their chance. A decades-old game of tug-of-war comes to a head, with 16-year-old Fields resident Krystal Weedon as the rope.
Rowling’s prose is workman-like. She has always over-relied on adjectives and adverbs, and her attempts at figurative language are generally awkward. For example, the aneurysm that kills Fairbrother “sliced through his brain like a demolition ball,” which isn’t very evocative and doesn’t make much sense — do demolition balls really slice? But her attention to detail and her intricate characters make up for that.
Rowling’s characters, be they heroes or villains, shine. They are detailed and recognizable: Narrow-minded, doting housewife Shirley Mollison regularly checks her “favorite medical website” to diagnose her neighbors. Apathetic, uptight Gavin Hughes, one of Fairbrother’s pallbearers, can’t stand that the wicker coffin puts him so close to the dead body. Council candidate Miles Mollison, who witnessed Fairbrother’s death, just wants people to recognize that he’s an important player, too.
But Weedon, with her multiple piercings and exposed thong, is the real thematic heart of the book. Weedon is tough, vulnerable, and entirely alone in the world. She curses like a sailor and outwardly scoffs at society, but she secretly dreams that her older half-sister Anne-Marie, whom she’s never met, will be her friend. She carries her little brother Robbie’s picture in a red, plastic heart keychain in her pocket. She stows her rowing medal — one of the few awards she’s ever gotten from Pagford — in the only safe, treasured place she has: a plastic jewelry box in her otherwise barren room. Weedon is a girl half-in and half-out of her community; she’s not wanted and knows it, but she can’t help but want to be part of it anyway.
The places where the book suffers are those where Rowling has tried the hardest to get away from her reputation as the author of the Harry Potter series. There’s a lot of sex and a lot of swearing, and while those aren’t bad in and of themselves, the book sometimes reads like South Park. That doesn’t seem to be what Rowling was going for.
But when she gets it right, Rowling’s new adult material injects a level of realism that wasn’t possible in Harry Potter. For example, social worker Kay Bawden recalls the many horrors she’s seen during her time working for Child Protective Services: “... and once (she dreamed of it, still), a child who had been locked in a cupboard for five days by his psychotic stepfather. That one had made the national news.” That’s a pretty bold step away from Harry Potter — in a dark direction.
Although Rowling’s book is bleak, there’s humor for those who are willing to look for it. Rowling has always been better at building worlds and observing people than she has been at constructing plots; she’s in her wheelhouse here, writing about a huge cast of sharply observed characters in a well-defined world. Instead of choosing one point of view, she narrates her story in a broad, omniscient voice, and it suits her — letting her play all her characters’ thoughts off each other and explore the little ironies, tragedies, and pettinesses of her cast. It is difficult not to laugh when sex-starved housewife Mollison breathes a sigh of relief when she discovers that, although she and her 14-year-old daughter both have crushes on members of an American boy band, they’re at least on different members. Never let it be said that Rowling doesn’t know the power of a good detail.
Mostly, though, The Casual Vacancy is a depressing book. The characters are, by and large, both unhappy and unlikeable. Their spots of hope are small and fragile; they are preoccupied with themselves and with their own troubles. The majority of what was good in their lives seems to have come from Fairbrother, who, as it gradually becomes clear, was the best person in Pagford. Rowling’s details work the other way as well, highlighting tragedies large and small in her characters’ lives, making gut-wrenching scenes of moments that otherwise might have been merely sad.
But there is a purpose to Rowling’s bleakness, and a strategy behind the unlikeability of her characters. Rowling’s book has one central theme that she hammers home: the desire of those comfortable with their lives to turn their backs on those who are afflicted. The heroes of the book — and there are very few of them — are the people who eventually manage to look away from their own lives and troubles and see value in the people around them. Meanwhile, the real villains of the story are not the people trying to oust the Fields; they are the ones who see what’s happening, and think, “I just can’t be bothered with local politics.”
The Casual Vacancy is a difficult book. It’s long, it’s sad, and there are precious few likeable characters. It’s a tragedy. But if you like tragedies, if your sense of humor runs to the dry, and if you are, like Rowling, constantly amazed by people’s willingness to avert their eyes — read it.

It’s fair to say that people have come to expect excellence from the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO). Between the orchestra’s international renown and its ability to consistently snatch world-class guest soloists for its performances, impressive concerts have become the norm for this musical gem in the heart of the Cultural District. But the PSO’s performance on Friday night featured the typically extraordinary orchestra at its very best.
While the PSO has no trouble bringing high-profile guest soloists to Heinz Hall, this time the orchestra chose to showcase its own talent: Concertmaster Noah Bendix-Balgley took the stage as solo violinist with a sweetly passionate rendition of Beethoven’s Concerto in D minor for Violin and Orchestra.
With its rapid, sweeping pace and almost unintelligibly fast successions of notes, the concerto is clearly not designed for the technically faint at heart. Bendix-Balgley not only gave an impeccable performance but supplemented it with his clean, pure stylistic voice.
After a warm introduction by the orchestra, Bendix-Balgley made his entrance with a series of sweet, climbing octaves. The high ethereal notes tumbled off the strings; the soloist’s fingers barely seemed to graze the fingerboard as they moved. Bendix-Balgley displayed exceptional grace and precision, even for a musician of his caliber.
As well as a sensitive and accomplished soloist, Bendix-Balgley proved himself a capable and daring composer. He wrote original cadenzas (guitar solos of sorts for the classical musician) and played them passionately — maintaining the sweet, sweeping melody of the piece while incorporating his own musical signature. Bendix-Balgley’s efforts earned him a wild standing ovation at the end of his performance. 
While it seemed unbelievable that the second part of the program could live up to the first, the orchestra’s performance of a reworked Mozart Requiem was equally impressive. 
The PSO’s rendition of the Requiem was all about ambience. Before the performance even began, the lights dimmed, and to the soft, chilling sound of a death bell, the audience read about the piece’s background on screens at the front of both sides of the hall.
Even when the musicians raised their instruments, and the members of the accompanying Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh rose from their seats, the Requiem was not played straight through. Interspersed between movements were other death-related works by Mozart and a few haunting Gregorian chants that offset the majestic piece with a quiet, chilling hum. The performance also featured readings by award-winning actor F. Murray Abraham, famed for his role as Salieri in Amadeus.
This collection of works, though somewhat eclectic, had the beautiful effect of drawing new meaning from centuries-old classics. The program emphasized how death, while a common and ubiquitous occurrence in Mozart’s time, is today a source of fear and uncertainty. This context lent a grave air to the performance and allowed the audience to absorb familiar music with a new perspective.
This kind of creative programming — reworking a familiar classic in an engaging and thought-provoking way — is something that the orchestra frequently pulls off with huge success. With this combination of creativity, a talented soloist, and a fantastic orchestra, the evening was among the best in the PSO’s recent history.

The National Endowment for the Arts’ 2009 report “Reading on the Rise” said that 47 percent of adults read at least one work of fiction in 2008. Not even half of America made it through a single short story that year, and that statistic is considered an improvement.
But we do read. We spend our time online: watching videos, browsing photos, and reading text online. From Facebook statuses to online news to our favorite nearly pornographic e-book, we are probably reading more words than ever; they simply aren’t coming from literary classics or the nation’s poet laureate. And if anything, the last decade has shown that we can collectively come together and read, from community-based big reads and one-book projects to the thermonuclear success of a single boy wizard.
None of this is wrong: Reading and writing — online or not — and developing tastes are important, even if these tastes are shared with our 450 million closest friends. But for voracious readers, there is a constant goal to expand one’s oeuvre, to find something new. So it’s worth a look when, each year in autumn, the Swedish Academy places the Nobel crown on the head of their most recently glorified author.
This year, the prize went to Mo Yan, a Chinese fiction writer who is probably utterly unknown to most American readers. His work, unlike much contemporary Chinese fiction, has been translated into English, largely because of Howard Goldblatt’s more than two decades of translating Chinese writers. Because of this, you could start reading one of Mo’s books now. Seriously, don’t let the rest of this article get in your way. Start with Red Sorghum or Life and Death are Wearing Me Out. You can even get the latter on your Kindle or e-reader of choice.
Many people have had their views of the Nobel Prize handed to them wholesale by the media, and think that these prizes are simply political gestures. Particularly resentful Americans believe that the Swedish Academy’s stubbornness to reward the best of our own country’s writers means it should be ignored. Politics are certainly at work in these awards, but the Academy still manages to select writers of fiction that is absolutely worth reading. The 2008 laureate Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio’s stories are terrifyingly depressing. Doris Lessing, winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Literature, defined whole genres. John M. Coetzee, the 2003 laureate, is one of our best living writers.
Politics are obviously involved. China can now proudly claim a Nobel Prize and at the same time happily continue pretending that the prizes its nationals won in 2000 and 2010 never happened. Arguably, Mo deserves the award for that alone: He has managed to successfully write oft-satirical novels, which are widely banned; has gained global acclaim; and yet remains in good standing with the Chinese government.
For example, take The Republic of Wine — an engrossing novel that rotates between detective Ding Gou’er and the short stories of Li Yidou. Between the fantastical elements of investigating baby cannibalism, audacious displays of government corruption and debauchery, and the uneven talents of a young writer, Mo is able to guide us through a tour of food and drink in China. Right from the lady trucker opening, Mo proves that he can spin a tale that delights, while providing a greater social commentary.
But consider these literary awards as recommendations from some very well-read friends. You may now go read Mo’s work, or, if you are a holdout, peruse the National Book Award finalists or wait until the Man Booker Prize is announced tomorrow. Awards will keep coming, the books will keep piling up: Read one.

Pittsburgh’s vibrant film community blossoms in the fall as the city plays host to a series of unique opportunities for cinephiles. This week marks the beginning of a great season for film as the Pittsburgh Lesbian and Gay Film Society presents the Reel Q LGBT Film Festival. Just on the heels of National Coming Out Day, Downtown’s Harris Theater will be showing exclusive programs of the latest and most vital work in LGBT cinema this week. There are a number of films to choose from, and this might be your only chance to see them.
Monday and Tuesday
Monday and Tuesday evening’s programs are made up of collected short films, with women’s pictures showing on Monday and men’s on Tuesday. The women’s program features six different films, including a musical, a period piece, and a celebrated work from Japan. During the men’s program, filmmakers from Canada, Australia, Germany, Spain, France, and the U.S. will be represented in nine different shorts.
Wednesday
Wednesday night will be the Pittsburgh premiere of Mary Lou, a film that has been described as an Israeli spin on Glee. A young gay man sets out for Tel Aviv to find his mother, whom he claims left him to become a backup singer for the famous Svika Pick. Mary Lou will be presented with English subtitles.
Friday
Following another evening of short films on Thursday, Friday’s program is dynamite. The celebrated British work Stud Life will play at 7 p.m. It features one of the most applauded performances in recent LGBT cinema from T’nia Miller. Stud Life will be followed by the new biographical movie Joshua Tree, 1951: A Portrait of James Dean at 9:30 p.m. James Dean, one of the most legendary figures in American culture, has always seemed elusive, but in focusing on the period just before his launch to fame, actor James Preston illuminates his conflicted, closeted youth.
The true beauty of Reel Q is the opportunity it affords. LGBT cinema is, unfortunately, still well outside the mainstream. However, these films don’t aspire to play in multiplexes, and they use that to their advantage. They’re films you won’t be able to see anywhere else, and they deal passionately and firmly with the most contested social issue in America. Reel Q gives us the chance to see these pictures the way they’re meant to be seen — as a social event. Many of these films may never find distribution outside the internet, so take some time this week to support a vibrant community and a growing slice of film culture.

Dear Patrick,
I am so busy with school and sleeping that I don’t have time to catch up on True Blood. I need my erotic vampire fix! How can I fix this?
Thanks,
Tense Vampire Fun-time Action Needed
Dear TV FAN,
Well, there’s your problem right there: You like True Blood. This may get me in trouble with my female readers, but it’s just not a good show. However, until the Men in Black (they’re real) commercialize their memory erasing technology, you can’t unwatch the show. In that case, you might as well finish it, since the series is already over. Luckily, now you can fast-forward through all the boring exposition and stick to the sex scenes.
Your problem here is simply one of time management. Luckily, since you’ve decided to go ahead and skip all the boring bits, watching a whole season should only take half an hour or so. If you’re actually in it for the story and the characters, then you’re watching the wrong show. Since you seem to be an HBO fan, watch The Wire. It’s not as dirty, but has a great plot and characters. If you still want some juicy scenes, try Deadwood.
As a Carnegie Mellon student, you shouldn’t be sleeping anyway,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
A lot of people say I’m narcissistic because I often talk about how handsome I am. But I can’t help being so good-looking! Is there anything I can do to change people’s opinions of me?
Thanks,
Desirable, Attractive Person Penalized Erroneously, Regardless Desire Advice Now
Dear DAPPER DAN,
It’s hard for us handsome folk sometimes, but don’t let the regular people get you down. They can’t help but be jealous of those cheekbones. You need to keep that in mind when you’re dealing with them. They don’t need constant reminders about how good-looking you are; they get that whenever they look at you. You don’t need to rub in the fact that they were beaten with an ugly stick.
However, maybe you still need that constant affirmation that you are attractive. You could do what girls do and say you look ugly or fat so your friends have to compliment you. Note that this doesn’t work if your friends are jerks; they’ll just wind up agreeing with you. Nothing wrong with being a tad narcissistic; just don’t stare into a river too long.
Mythological jokes are funny,
Patrick Hoskins

The Bagel Factory, located on the intersection of Forbes Avenue and Craig Street, is a relatively new destination for college students weary of campus choices. In the spacious yet often bustling restaurant, students can be found wolfing down a quick meal while frantically writing a paper, while others enjoy conversation over an extended afternoon snack.
The restaurant specializes in — you guessed it — bagels, but also offers breakfast and lunch fare ranging from French toast and oatmeal to deli sandwiches and burgers. However, the first thing that hits you about the Bagel Factory isn't the food itself; it’s the portions: They're huge. Upon ordering an omelet, a diner will receive a generous helping of hash browns and the choice of buttered and toasted bagel or two slices of toast. Prices do not disappoint either; $10 will provide a large deli sandwich and a drink. Those especially taken with one of the factory's many cream cheese varieties can buy it in a small $3 tub.
Although the Bagel Factory's large portions and moderate prices make it a good deal for any college student, quality seems to not be a constant variable in the equation. The plain bagel “stuffed” with lox, red onions, capers and tomatoes is untoasted and therefore chewy and the remaining components, while well-prepared, are dwarfed by an excessive dollop of cream cheese. Similarly, the cinnamon French toast truly tastes of cinnamon and has a pleasant, crunchy texture, but because it’s overcooked, any hint of moisture is absent without the assistance of a generous dose of syrup.
The Bagel Factory's bagels aren't of New York City stature nor is the French toast a perfect replica of breakfast back home. But its food is still good, its portions large, and its extensive menu will add flair to any college student's campus diet, making a short walk down Forbes to the restaurant worthwhile.

Rehana Mohammed, a graduate student in Heinz College, stood up on the Cut Thursday and told the campus the story of how she discovered she was gay and came out on the same night. Her father walked in on her kissing a friend at a sleepover.
“The next day he sent an ambassador, a.k.a. my mom, to come uncover the truth behind the situation. Had they been wrestling? Had I dropped the remote behind her and had to get it and it took a long time? Had my lips fallen on hers? Had there been some sort of situation that transpired? And this was the opportunity, right? This was the opportunity to lie. He laid it out for me. Tons of possible lies that I could just take, just use. But I was feeling tired. Didn’t get much sleep. Wink wink. And so, I just told the truth.”
Every year on National Coming Out Day, Carnegie Mellon’s ALLIES, an LGBT support group, hosts “Coming Out at the Fence.” For this event, ALLIES attempts to paint the Fence. However, in the past three years that Colin Meret, president of ALLIES, has been here, the group has been unable to take the Fence. This year was the same — Sigma Alpha Epsilon took the Fence to advertise its charity event, Donut Dash — so ALLIES hosted its event next to the Fence.
Members set up speakers and a microphone and allowed students, faculty, and staff the chance to share their coming out experiences with the Carnegie Mellon campus.
“I think it’s really helpful,” Meret said of National Coming Out Day. “I think it’s good for people who aren’t out to know that, well, there’s a whole day dedicated to this. Even if they don’t come out on that day, they still know that it means that there are people out there who are supporting, despite what might be their current vocal position.”
During the event, Gina Casalegno, dean of student affairs, shared her experience of her three-year-old son revealing that he wanted to be a ballerina “with a pink skirt and a cool pair of tights” for Halloween. 
When her husband turned to her and asked, “Are we in on this together? Do we want to do this together?” Casalegno replied, “Of course we’re gonna do this together. We’re gonna let our son be a ballerina.”
She later read a book to her children about various families and how, no matter how different each family is or how far apart they are, the family is still a family and still cares about each other.
“We’re on the verge of such potential change, and we have seen it coming slowly in my lifetime, and when I think of my kids and their future, I am very hopeful,” Casalegno said.
When stories weren’t being shared, ALLIES played recordings such as “25 Celebrity Coming Out Stories That Shocked The World” by The Huffington Post.
“It’s in your face in a good way,” Vivek Nair, sophomore electrical and computer engineering major, said of the event. “It’s actually effective at those half-hour marks, where a cluster of people wait to read. It gets the message across without being a parade. It tells a story, instead of spectacle.”
Meg Evans, housefellow for Stever House and coordinator of LGBTQ resources, said that ALLIES’s main goal is “a cross between advocacy, awareness, activism and community.” 
Evans also said that the number one way that LGBTs support people coming out is by “just having a community of people that is safe and is going to fully accept them for them.”
October is LGBT History Month. According to Evans, ALLIES has multiple events going on this month to promote awareness.
“Something about being gay that a lot of people think is awful is that you have to come out to everyone you meet. You know, you’re not just [gay] like straight people are just straight. And you’re straight until proven gay. And that does kinda suck, but I like to see it as an opportunity to come out in different ways every time,” Mohammed said. “I encourage people to think of coming out not only as this awful thing they build up to — which the first time it is — but the continual coming out.... Make it fun. Why not?”

CMU Garden and CulinArt, two organizations that focus on food and marketing, have teamed up to host a farmer’s market on campus.
The farmer’s market, according to CulinArt Director Shelby Cole, is meant “for CulinArt to extend even more efforts towards sustainability on campus.”
Cole believes that by holding events such as the farmer’s market, which is located in Resnik Cafe, students will be able to spend their DineX dollars on fresh groceries and other food staples that they would otherwise have to buy off campus.
First-year chemical engineering major Ben Lam enjoyed having more fresh produce on campus.
“My Interpretation and Argument class decided to take a field trip to the market,” he said. “And I definitely think I’ll go again if they have it in the future.”
The wide variety of produce in the farmer’s market is supplied by the CMU Garden, a student-run organization on campus that owns and tends a garden near the Solar Decathlon House in Donner Ditch.
Junior biology major Molly Berntsen, the president of the CMU Garden, said that the purpose of the garden is for students to get “together to learn sustainable ways of growing food.”
Berntsen was pleased with the way CulinArt has worked with and provided aid to the CMU Garden.
“The CulinArt farmer’s markets are the perfect size for us,” Berntsen said. “Because they occur monthly, we can just bring as much produce as we have available at that time.”
In total, four farmer’s markets are scheduled for this semester. The dates are determined by seasonal changes and harvesting times. 
The first two farmer’s markets have already occurred, but the next two are scheduled for Oct. 23 and Nov. 27.

Journalist and author Brooke Gladstone, the managing editor of National Public Radio’s On The Media, discussed the subconscious influence that media have on human decision-making processes last Monday. She spoke to an audience of around 75 students and faculty in Giant Eagle Auditorium in Baker Hall.
She focused her presentation on her recently published book, The Influencing Machine. The book uncovers the changing relationship between humans and new media.
While Gladstone does not believe that media portray an accurate representation of our nation, shebelieves they run on what they can sell, and therefore generate manifestations of our desires.
“Media are largely a reflection of who we are. Right now [we live in] a fractious and furious nation. You all are facing a media catastrophe: an apocalypse of dubious information,” she said.
According to Gladstone, conscious choice is an illusion, and consumers subconsciously change the information they consume to fit what they believe. She said this problem can be fixed if consumers first add their own thoughts to the “creative aggregation” of opinions in media.
Citing the Oracle of Delphi, Gladstone said to escape from the “nauseating experience of constantly questioning our beliefs,” we can focus on the phrase “know thyself” as the foundation for approaching media. “In an era when everything can be asserted and anything denied, the responsibility falls very heavily on each of us to know ourselves,” Gladstone said.
“We have a trusty stock of old opinions, and when someone contradicts them, or facts contradict them, or they contradict each other, we are thrown into turmoil,” she continued.
Gladstone said our reactions are driven more by impulse than by irrationality. She referenced statistics gleaned from studies conducted for her book to show the audience how the brain reacts to the mind’s stream of decisions.
“Everything that we know about cognition says that when faced with a contradiction, we use our rational brains to think about it, but that simply wasn’t the case,” she said.
Citing a study conducted in the ’60s on college student smokers and nonsmokers, Gladstone said the study found smokers were more likely to focus on information given contesting the relationship between smoking and cancer and the nonsmokers were more likely to focus on the information given affirming that link.
“There you can see very clearly that the filtering happens an awful lot in our own mind,” she said, adding that it is difficult to fight something that is so built into our brains.
Citing the implicit association test conducted by Harvard University, Gladstone explained that consumers could check their subconscious biases and discover the filtering that occurs constantly in their brains.
Gladstone believes that the only solution to fix the problem of media’s infiltration of our subconscious is “to bring the unconscious forward.”
“Our only choice is to bring those impulses and biases where we can see them,” she said. “Talk back to the media outlets that you consume, and produce and distribute your own information and commentary when you know it’s good.”
Students who attended Gladstone’s lecture said they got a lot out of it.
Elizabeth Lee, a master’s student in English, said, “I think that media can [start to affect us] if we don’t think critically about what it’s telling us every day. I think if we just absorb it, then it would be dangerous. Talks like [Gladstone’s] are good because it is good to be aware of keeping your filters on.”
Some students, however, disagreed with aspects of the talk. Kurt Sampsel, a Ph.D. student in English, said that he disagreed with Gladstone’s assertion that media is a reflection of what we desire. 
“I think it’s an interesting model of understanding or critiquing media to start with how it does things that we like, but it also ends up doing things that we don’t like. For instance, advertising ends up selling a lot of products that I’m not interested in, so it doesn’t necessarily mirror my interests,” he said.
Gladstone’s lecture was sponsored by the Humanities Center for its lecture series on media and social change, as well as by the Center for Arts in Society.
Kathleen Newman, an associate professor of English, was responsible for bringing Gladstone to campus. 
“I think of Brooke Gladstone as somebody who tries to take a pretty fair look at media and social change,” Newman said. “She is sometimes dubious about the power of media to make a positive change, so I thought she was an interesting person to play both sides of the argument.”
Gladstone has received two Peabody Awards, which are awarded yearly in recognition of distinguished public service by radio and television stations.

Former General Counsel and Ambassador for the Clinton administration Ira Shapiro delivered a lecture last Wednesday that compared the Senates of the past 30 years to the current Senate.
The lecture was hosted by Carnegie Mellon’s Center for International Relations and Politics (CIRP) and is part of an ongoing series of talks sponsored by the CIRP leading up to and following this year’s presidential election.
Kiron Skinner, director of the CIRP, said, “We think it’s important to bring in speakers that offer views from both perspectives [on political issues] before and after the election. Last week we had General Stanley McChrystal, and this week we are fortunate to have Mr. Shapiro.”
Shapiro, a Democrat, has completed numerous international trade deals while working in politics and government, most notably the North American Free Trade Agreement. He also helped establish the World Trade Organization. 
Shapiro, who has worked with the U.S. Senate and senators for the past three decades, began by talking about what he called “the last great Senate” — the Senate from the ’60s to the ’80s.
“I was at first worried that my nostalgia was making me see past Senates too favorably, and influencing my views on the present [Senate],” he said.
But after three years of research coupled with extensive personal experience, Shapiro published his book, The Last Great Senate. The book details the efficiency and successful bipartisan efforts of previous Senates.
Shapiro described the Senate of this past era as one with a record of monumental accomplishments: passing civil rights laws, creating Great Society legislation, and clashing with the executive branch over the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal.
Shapiro pointed out that the senators of this period were able to achieve an extraordinary amount and avoid the gridlock of today’s senators thanks to their willingness to work in a bipartisan way toward the common good.
What made the “last great Senate” so great? Shapiro offered an answer in three parts.
First, he explained that many of the senators between the ’60s and ’80s had either fought in World War II or had been affected by it in some large way. He described the generation that went through and emerged from the war as one that had great faith in the government and what it could do for the people.
Second, Shapiro said, this generation of senators did not have the vitriol and polarization of parties that the current Senate suffers from. He described the relationship among the past senators as a “healthy ecosystem.” 
“They would have fierce debates and then go out to dinner as friends,” Shapiro said.
Finally, as a result of the previous two points, the “last great Senate” was made up of a group of individuals that realized the Senate was a vehicle for national action, and not a vehicle for personal interest.
“They were in parties and represented states, but the national interest was first in their minds,” Shapiro said. “They were willing to take political risks, to be bipartisan, if they believed it was best for the country.”
He pointed to a series of events that led to the gradual change from the great Senate to the “miniaturized institution” of today. The first was the landslide victory of Ronald Reagan and Republican senators in 1980. “There was a great exodus of experienced senators, and there was an entrance of many neophyte conservatives,” Shapiro said.
Then, in the ’90s, things shifted for the worse when the resentment and polarization between the two parties in the House of Representatives began moving into Senate.
Since then, Shapiro said, it has gradually turned into more of a competition between two parties than an institution acting in the nation’s interest. “In the past, once an election was over, governing started. Somehow, we’ve entered the ‘permanent campaign’ and never a time for governing. There’s always jostling for a political advantage,” he said.
Shapiro said that much of today’s gridlock stems from the Republican Party. He pointed to the aftermath of the 2008 presidential election, when newly elected President Barack Obama faced the worst financial 
crisis since the Great Depression and the prospect of ending two wars.
“The Senate’s priority was to make sure Obama wasn’t reelected. That shouldn’t have been their priority. Their priority should have been the national interest,” Shapiro said.
“If you look back at what happened, the Senate Republicans didn’t allow the stimulus to be big enough.... They tried to block the healthcare bill even though it contained ideas from both parties.... We got close to the brink of default in 2011. In the past, [the debt ceiling] would have gotten raised automatically,” he said.
Even so, Shapiro has some optimism for change.
“The hope that I see comes from the senators themselves. They are as frustrated with the hyper-partisan system as the public is. There is a chance for change now, but they must decide themselves to go back to being senators,” he said.
Those who attended the lecture responded positively to Shapiro’s talk, saying that his explanation of what made past Senates so effective was clear and insightful.
“What he said made sense,” said sophomore international relations and politics major Razghiem Golden. “A lot of times, politicians worry about staying in office more than getting stuff done. The change needs to start from the top down.”
“I’m Republican, but I think Obama is the best choice for the next election. He has the chance to do something more radical [if elected] because he doesn’t have to worry about running for another term,” Golden continued.
As Shapiro closed his talk, he reminded the audience both of the past Senates’ triumphs, and of the problems that face the current and next Senates. 
“The next Senate elected in January has a great privilege; they walked where the greats walked. They have to work the way the greats worked,” he said.

Lenore Blum, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, recently presented a School of Computer Science Special Talk Lecture. The lecture, which took place Tuesday in Rashid Auditorium, was titled “Alan Turing and the Other Theory of Computation.” Alan Turing is a famous figure in computer science, and is well known for inventing the Turing machine and for his work with the theory of computation.
The lecture was an encore performance of one Blum delivered earlier this year to celebrate Turing’s 100th birthday.
Turing is known for his role in the development of the theory of computation, but Blum’s lecture focused on his work in what she calls the “other theory of computation,” based on “numerical analysis and continuous mathematics” in scientific computing, rather than “logic and discrete mathematics in computer science.”
She noted the differences between the two areas. Computer science uses “0s and 1s,” discrete mathematics, and the Turing machine; it solves problems exactly and is a function of input word size. Meanwhile, scientific computing employs real and complex numbers and uses algebraic analysis and continuous mathematics; it “solves problems to a certain accuracy” and is a function of “intrinsic word size.”
“They really are two cultures,” Blum said.
First, Blum spoke about “where Turing meets Newton and bridges the two traditions” of computer science. 
Blum described how, in 1936, Turing demonstrated his interaction with real numbers in his first paper. He “used real numbers as a motivation to define his machine.” 
Additionally, in a paper written afterwards, Turing returned to computing with real numbers. 
Blum said Turing’s experience was positive, as it was “fashionable to talk about computing as a lens on the sciences.”
First-year English major Andy Hutner had a positive opinion of the lecture. “Well, I’m actually familiar with Alan Turing, even though I’m not in the mathematical field, because his theories on discrete mathematics play a big part in the study of linguistics,” he said. “I think Blum did a great job of showing Turing’s contributions to mathematics in a different way than most people would think of.”
Blum has been on Carnegie Mellon’s faculty since 1999. She has dedicated a large portion of her career to the advancement of women in mathematics and science. Blum is a founder of Women@SCS, as well as the founding director of Project Olympus, which supports Carnegie Mellon-based tech start-ups.

Students develop biosensor for engineering competition
A team of Carnegie Mellon undergraduates have developed a biosensor that can be used to monitor cell activities.
The team developed its sensor for the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition, which focuses on synthetic biology. Competing teams were given a toolkit of biological building blocks and were then asked to design and build a synthetic biological system using their knowledge of fundamental biology.
Carnegie Mellon’s team developed a biosensor using a fluorogen-activating RNA sequence and a fluorogen-activating protein that glows brighter in response to cellular activities like transcription and translation. Then, using a mathematical model, the students were able to analyze the results and determine the efficiency of several promoters in bacteria.
The Carnegie Mellon team consists of junior chemical engineering and biomedical engineering double major Yang Choo; sophomore and senior electrical and computer engineering and biomedical engineering majors Peter Wei and Jesse Salazar, respectively; and sophomore biological sciences major Eric Pederson. The instructors are Cheemeng Tan, a postdoctoral fellow in the Ray and Stephanie Lane Center for Computational Biology, and Natasa Miskov-Zivanov, an adjunct professor in the department of electrical and computer engineering.
SCS to offer robotics as new undergraduate major
In addition to the undergraduate courses it already offers, the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute is now offering an additional major in robotics. The additional major is available for all students, particularly those with technical majors such as computer science or electrical and computer engineering.
Matt Mason, the director of the Robotics Institute, said in a university press release, “The Robotics Institute always has been at the forefront, not only of robotic technology, but of the education of roboticists.”
“We created the first Ph.D. and master’s degree programs and the first undergraduate minor in robotics. Undergraduates already are an important part of the institute, working side by side with our researchers on some of our most exciting projects. Providing the option of robotics as an additional major just seems like the natural next step,” he said.
The program will focus on robotic control systems, movement, machine perception, systems engineering, and cognition and reasoning, with hands-on courses on designing, building, and programming robots.
It is suggested that current students who wish to pursue the additional major apply to the program by Feb. 1 of their first year, although it is possible for sophomores to apply as well.

Last week Nobel Prizes were awarded in physics, chemistry, peace, and physiology or medicine. Founded by Alfred Nobel in 1901, the Nobel Prize is awarded for significant achievements in the sciences, in the arts, or for peace. In celebration of the recent Nobel laureates, here are some facts about the awards:
3: The maximum number of people to whom an award can be given in a single category every year.
100–250: The number of nominees per prize.
50: The number of years that Nobel nominees’ names are kept secret after their nominations.
2: The number of times that Frederick Sanger won the Nobel Prize in chemistry. He is the only person to win a Nobel Prize twice (in 1958 and 1980, respectively).

Although college is supposed to be the transition from childhood to adulthood, the nostalgia that comes from reliving childhood pastimes can relieve stress and raise spirits. However, that transition to adulthood is often fast and jarring. It will be hard to escape the mundane activities and repetitiveness of adult life, and all of us will surely yearn for our youth at some point during our adulthood.
Luckily, we’re in college, and we still have full reign to bask in the nostalgia of simpler times. Therefore, we commend AB Special Events for helping us make the most of this time by hosting a petting zoo Tuesday on the College of Fine Arts lawn.
AB Special Events “exists to provide the campus community with various novelty events throughout the year,” according to its website. While no other upcoming events are currently listed, we hope the organization continues to provide fun and unexpected activities in the future, especially events similar to the impromptu petting zoo.
While such things may seem immature to some, the student body revels in the euphoria that fluffy animals can bring to campus. Harkening back to our childhoods — be it through proximity to farm animals, obscure references to childhood TV shows, or playing with Nerf guns — is an excellent way to deal with the stress of academia and our imminent dive into maturity.
The largest event of the year for Carnegie Mellon, Spring Carnival, is entirely devoted to this concept. Funnel cakes, carnival rides, and fun houses not only fill our time during the festivities: They bring us back to a mindset when we were less cynical and everything was magical. 
Petting a goat on campus on a Tuesday afternoon may seem trivial, but it’s the little things that matter. It’s those special moments in the day when we can forget about midterms, deadlines, that roommate of yours who doesn’t empty the sink, and relax, if ever so briefly. 
We applaud AB Special Events for making this feeling accessible to the student body, as a petting zoo does as much for the soul as a life lesson from Mr. Feeny.

After the first presidential debate on Oct. 3, many people wondered why President Barack Obama performed so poorly. Was it the high altitude? Was it the fact that his 20th wedding anniversary fell on the same date? These theories only distract from the main reason that — in addition to the demands of a reelection — Obama has a pretty stressful job.
The thing about being the President of the United States is that everyone else knows how to do the job, but no one else actually wants to do it, because to do so requires running for president. And running for president in the 21st century is, quite frankly, awful. Everything you’ve ever done in your life is up for grabs and blown out of proportion.
Obama is learning this the hard way. In 2008, his assurances of hope and change left him unscathed by the cynical media. Huge expectations were placed on him. He was going to be this; he was going to do that. Granted, Obama only fed America’s infatuation with his blind optimism.
After four years, the sobering realization that hope and change have little swaying power over partisan discord has left many Americans frustrated with our political system and its leaders. The pervading negativity of the current presidential campaign only reinforces the cynicism of those political leaders. One can only wonder how the man at the top has handled this blistering campaign and his fall from invincibility.
He seems to be, by most accounts, an introvert. The same man who electrifies crowds of thousands has trouble cozying up to donors with fat wallets. While this trait can be a great quality in a leader, it can sometimes be self-defeating. He is not Republican candidate Mitt Romney, who can easily shake his Etch-a-Sketch —  erasing a history of mudslinging through the Republican primaries — to win some votes. Obama is his own biggest critic, and with that comes a lot of unnecessary stress.
On Oct. 3, Obama stood at the University of Denver stressed with the challenges of a recession and the hectic schedule of a reelection. However, it wasn’t the external pressures that caused his listless performance. It was the stress he puts on himself. He has a mountain of troubles, but doesn’t seem to ask for anyone’s sympathies. His fatherless childhood shaped him into the untrusting, do-it-yourself man he is. It’s what’s gotten him here, but it’s also hurting him.
In a CNN/ORC International poll released on Aug. 26, 53 percent of likely voters felt that Obama cares about the needs of people compared to 39 percent for Romney. But how many of us truly care about our President and his well-being?
I feel sorry for him. He’s got it tough and it will probably get worse. In the meantime, the man could use a hug.

It’s no secret that students in the humanities often struggle to find relevant resources in their fields at Carnegie Mellon. Recently, though, I finally gave Carnegie Mellon’s online recruiting system, TartanTrak, a try. Specifically, I tried using ProNet, a tool for current students to connect with relevant alumni from a student’s major, career interests, industry, and geographic area, in addition to other search criteria. The results I received were frustrating and disheartening.
As a professional writing major, I began my search with a few parameters like “professional writing major,” “interested in publishing and printing,” and “in Pittsburgh, Pa.” My search brought zero results. Broadening my search to one parameter, “professional writing major,” yielded six results. Carnegie Mellon has thousands of alumni from all over the world, and the Department of English website website boasts “almost 30 years of experience educating professional and technical writers,” and only six of these alumni are willing to receive an email from me regarding my future? I find the notion either very sad or very unlikely. In the case that only six alumni of my major are willing to give back to campus by helping current students, some serious work needs to be done in building morale and pride in the program.
What about my friends who are here studying other majors, such as global studies or linguistics? Thoroughly intrigued by the lack of results I received for professional writing, I also ran searches for “global studies major” and “linguistics major,” which each yielded zero results. If the answer to the lack of support in these areas of the humanities is the newness of the programs, I find that a legitimate argument. But I also feel the university and specifically Dietrich College should have suggestions for finding resources for students in these departments.
The problem I find more likely, though, is a lack of communication and outreach to alumni in the many departments and programs Carnegie Mellon has. If TartanTrak is going to be marketed by the Career Center as a place to explore your options, then the claim needs to be true. The university has an obligation to reach out to alumni in all majors, especially if they are going to suggest ProNet as a resource to connect with relevant alumni.
Other big issues with ProNet also need to be addressed before it can be seen as a helpful resource for students of any major. In my attempts to navigate TartanTrak’s ProNet search, I ran into a lot of confusion. 
There is a section for specifying “College/University” on the search page with no explanation for what that means. Is the list of schools presented places that Carnegie Mellon alumni also attended? Is it a list of schools where a students might want to attend after their time at Carnegie Mellon?
Along the same train of thought, when specifying my state in the search box, I could choose between “PA” and “Pennsylvania.” Cleaning up the search page and adding better descriptions and directions are all overlooked issues that should be taken care of if the Career Center ever expects students to make regular use of the website.
ProNet is a great idea in theory. Providing undergraduate students the opportunity to connect and network with alumni in their field or major is an admirable goal. But in order for these connections to happen, Carnegie Mellon, and especially Dietrich College, needs to reach out to more alumni, and the website must be made more user friendly.

Every American citizen should be generally aware of the happenings in the Supreme Court; the rulings it makes affect our entire nation, after all. But one of the court’s most recent cases could have a monumental impact on Carnegie Mellon and its student body.
The case, Fisher v. University of Texas, concerns the use of affirmative action in admissions at the University of Texas at Austin. 
Abigail Fisher and Rachel Maichaelwicz, both white women, applied to UT Austin in 2008. When they were both denied admission, they filed suit, arguing that racial discrimination was at play. The case has made its way up the ladder of our district court system since 2009, and in both the lower court cases, the university’s affirmative action policy was upheld.
The Supreme Court, however, is split on this issue. With Justice Elena Kagan, who was involved as Solicitar General, sitting out this case, Justice Anthony Kennedy probably stands as the decisive vote.
If, through this case, the Supreme Court rules to revise or entirely scrap 2003’s Grutter v. Bollinger, which allowed colleges to use race in their admissions processes, Carnegie Mellon will have to rethink its admissions and scholarship processes.
According to a Carnegie Mellon research study conducted in 2009, minority enrollment in top-tier schools could decrease by 35 percent if affirmative action were to be banned. 
Carnegie Mellon, known for engineering a diverse campus, would be drastically affected.
In a 2003 memo from Carnegie Mellon President Jared Cohon, he made very clear that the university is “committed to equal opportunity for all, and to affirmative action.” A significant part of Carnegie Mellon’s culture and values stem from the idea that diversity stimulates intellectual and personal growth, that surrounding students and faculty members with people unlike them not only “makes them better” — as stated in the memo — but also makes Carnegie Mellon a way station for almost every valid opinion and perspective.
We at The Tartan advise all Carnegie Mellon students to pay particular attention to the Fisher v. University of Texas case, so they can be well-informed about what could be an immense change to campus life and university policy.

Pokémon played a prominent role in our generation’s childhood. From the video games to the trading cards to the television show, Pokémon is a fun and exciting franchise, remembered fondly by almost all who grew up with it.
However, the release of the newest Pokémon video game has brought on some substantial criticism from animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, better known as PETA.
PETA, well known for its outlandish publicity stunts to draw attention to their causes, has started protesting the Pokémon franchise as promoting animal abuse.
In opposition to the new game, PETA released an online parody titled Pokémon Black & Blue: Gotta Free ’em All. The game and its artwork feature a bandaged, bloodied Pikachu that escaped to fight for freedom against its former, bloodstained masters.
Pikachu can fight back using standard attacks such as “Thundershock” and “Quick Attack,” but can also “Protest” or try to engage in a “Group Hug.”
On top of that, once you successfully beat your trainer, your reward is the ability to watch videos of animal cruelty.
The choice to protest Pokémon, out of all the possible causes to choose from, seems absurd. 
PETA’s decision to attack a game series that has passed its peak, one whose anime and related products emphasize values like friendship and companionship, seems inexplicable.
Below the parody game, PETA wrote, “The amount of time that Pokémon spend stuffed in pokéballs is akin to how elephants are chained up in train carts, waiting to be let out to ‘perform’ in circuses.” It added, “If PETA existed in Unova, our motto would be: Pokémon are not ours to use or abuse. They exist for their own reasons. We believe that this is the message that should be sent to children.”
It is worth noting that, despite their role as fighting pets in the videogames, the Pokémon cartoons and movies have always emphasized that Pokémon should be treated humanely and with respect as friends. Nintendo also went to lengths to emphasize that Pokémon only “faint” after their battles, and do not die as a result of fighting in battles during the game.
This isn’t the first time PETA has distorted popular games for its cause, having released a Mario parody in the past and Super Tofu Boy in response to the popular indie game Super Meat Boy.
Despite the absurdity of this protest, the game has been successful at one thing: gaining attention. 
What better way to get your name in the news than by attacking people’s fond childhood memories? PETA has always been an organization concerned about gaining publicity, and doesn’t care if it’s good or bad.
If PETA wants to raise awareness for animal rights, that is its own prerogative. 
However, attacking our childhood memories and a perfectly innocent game franchise is not the best way to do this.

Speaking at a recent dinner event at a Baptist Church in Georgia, Congressman Paul Broun (R.-Ga.) declared, “All that stuff I was taught about — evolution, embryology, Big Bang theory — all that is lies straight from the pit of hell. It’s lies to try to keep me and all the folks who are taught that from understanding that they need a savior.” Unfortunately, this statement might not be surprising to those attuned to American political discourse.
What did surprise me is that Broun is on the U.S. House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, whose jurisdiction includes energy policy, research, and science education. 
Yes, someone who legislates policy related to educating youth about proper science would presumably be unable to pass a grade school class that taught it. Marking “It’s a lie from hell” on a bio test would be a surefire way to fail. Our country, which has led the world in science research in countless fields for years, appears to be run by those who, because of their fundamentalist views, lack a fundamental understanding of reality.
What’s even more shocking is that not only is Broun a medical doctor, but he also holds a B.S. in chemistry from the University of Georgia. It would now appear that he holds science as B.S.
Further complicating matters is the fact that none other than U.S. representative Todd Akin of Missouri, best known for his comments regarding “legitimate rape,” is on the same committee. Wired magazine complied a list of things other members have said regarding climate change and related issues. Suffice it to say, not everyone on the committee accepts the truth of global warming, and it’s only the Republican members who have made such statements.
How can this be? Do these Congressmen really not believe in something for which there is mountains of evidence? I’m not so sure. But I do know that according to a Gallup poll, 46 percent of their constituents think God made the human race less than 10,000 years ago. It could very well be that they’re saying whatever people want to hear to get elected, but considering Broun is running unopposed this year, this might not hold true in every case.
Regardless of why such anti-science rhetoric exists in our political system, the question remains: What can we do about it? Science advocates such as Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye attempt to reach out to young people, but as I previously wrote in The Tartan, this has garnered a rather negative response from the kinds of people who vote in anti-science legislatures. Clearly we need to improve education, but how are we supposed to get an educated electorate with these anti-science people in charge?
Luckily, though, there is hope. Just this past week, a Pew report showed that those with no religion are on the rise and Protestants — the religious group that most Creationists call home — are no longer the majority, with about a third of those under 30 years old claiming no organized faith.
Why is this good? It means that presumably public favor with certain flavors of fundamentalist dogma are on a downslide. People are less likely to accept arguments for or against certain laws based on faith alone. More progressive views might have a chance to be heard without fear of being labeled as “against family values.” 
There will still be opposition, no doubt; the anti-intellectual strain in this country is too deep seated to disappear overnight. Yet we can be reasonably certain that future politicians will have all the more reason to study up if they want to stay in office.

This month, for the first time since the start of 2009, the unemployment rate has been below 8 percent. Although many pundits and commentators are celebrating this milestone in the gradual economic recovery we’ve been having, there are certain individuals who have eyed the 7.8 percent unemployment rate with skepticism.
Last week, Jack Welch, a former CEO of General Electric, came out with the theory that the Obama administration fixed the unemployment numbers for political advantage in the month before the election. In an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, Welch stated that it was highly suspect that the unemployment rate would have dropped from 8.3 percent to 7.8 percent in the span of two months. He did not, however, offer any concrete evidence of any alleged numbers-fixing.
Noted economists, such as Nobel Prize winners Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia University and Paul Krugman of Princeton University, sharply criticized the “jobs-number conspiracy,” and for good reason. Welch’s statements display a deep ignorance of the economic and political realities in the U.S.
Fixing the jobs numbers would be an act of political stupidity on behalf of the Obama administration. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which collects economic data on the state of employment, has civil servants with various political affiliations that have worked over many administrations. Its data is available to the public and can be easily verified. 
Someone would have blown the whistle if the jobs number had been falsified. It is highly unlikely that President Barack Obama would engage in such an easily discoverable fraud a month before the election. If it did not entirely sabotage his chances for re-election, it would certainly risk a Watergate-esque investigation after Nov. 11.
Secondly, the jobs numbers are not out of line with the data collected in the past year. While the BLS’s estimates of unemployment vary within 0.1-0.2 percentage points each month, they do show a general trend of real — albeit slow — job growth over the last few years. Furthermore, the BLS tends to undercount jobs during recoveries because the survey of employers that they use to determine the rate often does not take into account newly established businesses. This is what happened over the months of July and August, and subsequent BLS revisions to those numbers show that there have been 50,000 more jobs created than previously thought.
For students, the improvement in the unemployment rate suggests real cause for celebration. For once, the rate this month has dropped not because people have stopped looking for jobs, but because there is an actual increase in the number of jobs. Furthermore, there has been an increase in the number of full-time jobs for Americans age age 16–24. Although the future of the economy is still uncertain, these past few weeks have given us something to be optimistic about.

Kyle Henson wrote an article for The Tartan last week, “Economy must be top issue for young voters,” that emphasized that it takes no leadership or skill for politicians to take a stance on social issues. The article also made the case for young voters to vote based solely on the economic issues of the nation, since social issues will remain stagnant due to the ineptitude of our country’s politicians.
Henson asks if we are naive enough to make any issue more important than the economy and our future job prospects. While I agree that the economy is one of the most important problems facing the country today, to disregard social issues and other obstacles plaguing the nation as secondary to and entirely dependent on our financial future is equally naive. 
Additionally, while it is easy to criticize politicians on both sides of the aisle for their lack of action, it is by no means reason to disregard the personal or public stances of all politicians on social issues as irrelevant or inconsequential.
First, I’ll address the current political landscape. I share Henson’s discontent for politicians who don’t follow through with promises on which they run their campaigns, and for a Congress that is entrenched in partisanship, endless repeals, and little compromise. But to shrug off President Barack Obama, presidential candidate Mitt Romney, and the entirety of Congress as completely passive and unable to take a stance on social issues is ignorant.
It is a far cry to say that Obama and Romney share the same view on marriage equality. Henson claims that, “Both want to leave it to the states to decide if same-sex couples can get married,” yet Romney’s campaign website states that the Republican candidate will “champion a Federal Marriage Amendment to the Constitution defining marriage as between one man and one woman.”
But this might all be hot air, since how often does legislation on social issues come to fruition? Henson can only recall Congress’ measure to “declare pizza a vegetable” (which wasn't what happened, but that’s beside the point) as an example of our legislative branch’s recent achievements.
I’d like to jog his memory with the Congressional repeal of “Don’t ask, don’t tell” (DADT) in 2010, a landmark for gay rights in the U.S. The repeal of this unconstitutional segregation is only the start of a movement for equal rights for all Americans. To say the status quo on social issues isn’t changing is utterly false.
If DADT or marriage equality doesn’t personally affect you, this past summer Congress passed a bill that prevented subsidized Stafford loan interest rates for students from doubling to 6.8 percent for this academic year. 
Some may see this as an economic issue, but I see it as a social issue. The country has an ethical imperative to help students gain access to affordable, high-quality education, which more than anything else will help bring the nation out of any turmoil or crisis.
Social issues are far from a stagnant arena. Many baby boomers in politics on both sides of the aisle are stubbornly entrenched in their beliefs and viewpoints.
But soon they will have to make way for our generation. I believe our generation of political leaders will be more open-minded, more willing to listen to and consider the opposition, and less shackled by an aging, two-party, black-and-white view of the political system.
Secondly, I’ll address the prioritization of economic issues for young voters. Henson cites an article from the Associated Press that says 53.6 percent of college graduates under the age of 25 are jobless or underemployed. However, that same article states that in 2000, well before the Great Recession and Obama, that percentage was at a low of 41 percent. 
An increase of 12.6 percent is nothing to scoff at, but it provides more context to the situation.
Regardless, Henson’s argument hinges on this claim that, “If you can’t pay for an abortion or your same-sex wedding, it’s not going to happen whether it’s legal or not.” It’s overly simplistic to think that every aspect of our society must take a backseat to revenue and expenditures.
Henson fails to realize a crucial aspect of this nation and its citizens. It’s not the economy that drives and sustains America: It’s people. It’s the values and passions that get us out of bed every morning to follow our vocations. Through our virtues and actions, we will leave behind a legacy to our children — hopefully a legacy that we’re proud to stand by. 
The true cost of modern times on future generations won’t only be the burdens of our economy: It will also be how we faced injustice, ignorance, and oppression.
On Nov. 6, my vote will be for the candidate who is best aligned to act in accordance with my beliefs on all issues. Young voters: I have the utmost confidence in you. I implore you to vote likewise, whether I agree with you or not. Don’t let others dictate whom you should vote for or what you should base your vote on.

Ms. CMU, a new organization on campus, held a “Who Needs Feminism?” campaign at the Fence last week. Its efforts are part of a larger campaign that first started at Duke University in April and spread like wildfire thanks to Facebook and Tumblr.
The campaign consists of individuals holding up signs outlining the basic reasons why they are feminists; it’s a “PR” campaign for feminism, to show people all the reasons why feminism is still necessary. Ms. CMU’s members were trying to get Carnegie Mellon students to do the same. The one time I walked past them at the Fence last week, they were clutching a small whiteboard, calling out, “Come tell us why you need feminism!” Alas, even though there were plenty of people walking past them, I didn’t see anyone stop.
It’s unfortunate, because Carnegie Mellon could use more feminism. There’s still plenty of sexism pervasive on campus, a prime example being an incident with the Fence a few weeks ago. Some Hamerschlag residents decided to paint, “McGill, I could use a sandwich...” on the Fence. On an ensuing conversation on The Tartan’s Facebook page, many students defended it as “just a joke,” dismissing those who found it offensive as being overly sensitive and humorless.
Consider this: Sandwich jokes and other similarly sexist jokes reinforce the stereotypes within our culture that women are inferior and subservient to men.
You may say “So what?” but those stereotypes have quantitative consequences. Studies have shown that, when members of groups believed to be academically inferior — African-American or Latino students, or women in math and sciences — are reminded of their race or gender right before taking a test, they will get lower scores than they would if they weren’t reminded of such stereotyped qualities. It’s a phenomenon dubbed “stereotype threat,” and considering the size of the math and science programs here, reinforcing these stereotypes is detrimental for women in those majors.
Even the administration could use a strong dose of feminism. All of the deans of our university’s seven different colleges are male, and women only make up a little under 30 percent of the top administrators at Carnegie Mellon.
But gender issues aren’t limited to underperformance or underrepresentation in leadership roles. They expand into far more dangerous territory. A 2009 report from the Center for Public Integrity indicated that more than 20 percent of college women will be a victim of rape or attempted rape by the time they leave college, but a later investigation that the Center conducted found that “on many campuses, abusive students face little more than slaps on the wrist.”
Only 12 percent of students found “responsible” for rape are expelled, while the rest merely receive practically negligible punishments — one student accused of rape was found guilty of “sexual contact” and was suspended for the following semester, which was a summer semester during which he would not have been taking classes anyway. And considering that over half of assaults nationwide go unreported, there are probably many unreported assaults that allow the attackers to go without punishment.
You might think Carnegie Mellon is an “elite” school, and thus would be immune to such issues. But just because we don’t have public conversations about assault on this campus, that doesn’t mean assault doesn’t happen. I know women who have been stalked and harassed by Carnegie Mellon men. I’ve personally been assaulted by another Carnegie Mellon student.
Feminism gives us the space, the vocabulary, and the strength to address each of these issues head-on. It’s personally given me the confidence and ability to overcome the issues I’ve faced.
I think Carnegie Mellon needs feminism. Do you?

Pennsylvania are four presidential candidates representing four different parties. They are Democratic Party nominee President Barack Obama, Republican Party nominee Mitt Romney, Green Party nominee Jill Stein, and Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson.
But there are even more political parties out there than you or I have ever heard of, one being the Socialist Equality Party that has been putting up flyers around campus. There’s also the Constitution Party, the Justice Party, the Peace and Freedom Party, and the Reform Party, started in 1995 by Ross Perot, who gained 20 percent of vote in the 1992 presidential election as an Independent candidate.
Yet despite all this, people complain daily about the injustices of the two party system, and how they’d vote for Johnson if he just had a chance of winning. 
If we have a two-party system, then it’s entirely self-inflicted. Political parties aren’t even mentioned in the Constitution, and there’s absolutely nothing systemic about two-party dominance.
Perot polled strongly enough in 1992 to be included in the presidential debates, and people speculate that he would’ve have a much better shot at winning had he not dropped out and re-entered the race only a month before the election. It’s entirely possible for a challenger to be taken seriously and take the White House.
If everyone who wanted a third party to enter the fray and really change the trajectory of the nation went out and voted for that candidate rather than for either the Republican and Democratic nominee, that candidate would begin to be taken seriously and maybe even win a race. At the very least, that candidate’s platform would be absorbed into the current two parties, which has happened consistently to almost every third party in our nation’s history.
The Republicans started as a conglomerate of the Free-Soilers, Greenbacks, Anti-Masons, Whigs, and Know-Nothings. The Populists of the 1890s were absorbed into the Progressives, which were then absorbed by the Democratic Party. Finally, Perot’s platform of fiscal solvency was absorbed into the Republican Party in 1994, when the U.S. ran a balanced budget for four years.
On an interesting note, Johnson and the Libertarian Party have filed an anti-trust lawsuit against the Republican and Democratic parties for not allowing him to enter the debates.
This is entirely unprecedented and certainly won’t have any discernible outcome until well after the election, but it’ll be interesting to see where it goes. Current policy on the debates is that 15 percent support in the polls gets you a podium. This further reinforces the need for people disheartened with our current two parties to support an alternative. We’re not lacking for options, just for people willing to stand up for what they truly believe in.
If you don’t like Obama or Romney, please vote for someone else. Give your support to Johnson or Stein. 
You’ll be giving that candidate a much-needed bump, and, if enough people follow your trajectory, you’ll contribute to our democracy. Hopefully, you’ll see your will enacted either through that third party, or through an existing party that desperately needs your vote.

New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and the city’s Department of Education implemented the program Connecting Adolescents To Comprehensive Healthcare (CATCH) last year to prevent teenage pregnancy in students of city schools.
This pilot program for sexual education and contraceptives has been in place for almost two years, but it recently gained the spotlight for its expansion from five to 13 schools, and for teens’ increased access to the morning-after pill, also known as Plan B.
New York City’s plan to reduce teen pregnancy by increasing sexual education and availability of various contraceptives is a step in the right direction. The U.S. has one of the highest teen pregnancy rates when compared to equally developed countries.
But allowing Plan B to be easily accessible will perpetuate the idea that unprotected sex is okay.
Plan B is not a substitute for traditional contraception, such as condoms or the pill; it is supposed to be true to its name: A “plan B” for if your plan A fails. Making Plan B so accessible will make it too easy for teens to count on Plan B in a way they shouldn’t.
An increase in unprotected sex will result in an increase in pregnancies, because while Plan B is effective, it is not as effective as traditional contraceptives. Unprotected sex also results in a higher chance of contracting STIs. 
If Plan B is to be available, students should learn its risks and dangers of overuse. However, Plan B is better than no plan at all, so schools should have information for students on how to access it, especially for victims of sexual assault.
Those behind CATCH also hoped that the plan would result in an increase in communication between parents and their teens about sex. 
But making contraception available at student health centers means that teens don’t need to communicate with their parents at all — they just need to speak to the school nurse. In this way, schools are going over the parents’ heads. 
While the schools asked parents for their consent, some didn’t feel comfortable or sure of their opinions; these and other parents simply didn’t answer. Many never received any kind of notification about the program.
There are parts of New York City’s plan that do make sense, though. Condoms should be available to students, as should sexual education.
Sex is a part of life for many teens; pregnancy shouldn’t be. And since teens are inevitably going to be making choices about sex, they should be educated on the potential consequences of their actions and how to take precautions to avoid them. 
Plan B is an effective form of birth control as a second or third option, but should remain behind the counter in a pharmacy, not with the school nurse.
