Jeffrey Ko, one of the candidates on the slate for Student Body President, along with his running mate Carrie Haney, is running with the slogan “Proven Leadership. Compassionate. Determined.” Ko, a junior studying International Relations and Politics and Hispanic Studies, with a minor in Cybersecurity, lists as his credentials his two consecutive years in the Student Senate, from first being elected in the Fall of 2017 to serving as the Chair of the Senate’s Committee on Advocacy the following year. 
Haney, who is running alongside Ko for the Student Body Vice President position, is a junior double majoring in International Relations & Politics and Statistics & Data Science, with a minor in Chinese Studies. She is the former New Member Educator for the Carnegie Mellon branch of Alpha Phi, and is on the executive board for the political debate club the Roosevelt Institute. Haney has also served two years on the Student Senate, and has worked on the Communication Committee. Her goal is to “make the office of the student body president accessible and transparent to the student body,” and building a productive relationship between the Senate and the Student body. 
Ko’s platform was inspired by conversations he has had with members of the campus community, as well as his time on the Committee on Advocacy, where he pushed to for increased diversity on campus, improved awareness of sexual assault, and “challenged the proposed changes to the Title IX guidelines proposed by the Department of Education.” Additionally, he wrote and passed an initiative requiring candidates for tenure-track positions to declare their “commitment to foster a diverse and inclusive space in academia.” Ko’s policy positions include increased student wages, collaborative art spaces “similar in 
function to The Fence,” and increased transparency and communication between the Senate and student body. 
For his policies, he sees his role as laying the vital groundwork for the future and building a lasting effort that can be sustained throughout multiple administrations. As an extension of his work on diversity and inclusion at the university, Ko plans to “set aside funding so that Student Ambassadors visit historically underserved regions and groups of people to attract the talent and minds for a more representative community.” He plans to further promote diversity by enacting a “mandatory written submission for tenure-track candidates that highlights their understanding of the barriers that underserved groups experience and their dedication in addressing these barriers in all capacities.”
As for voters, Ko encourages everyone to check out the policy positions available, and to “actively engage throughout this deliberation policy and really understand what the policies are of each candidate.” “If I were a voter, I would posit that everyone really takes the tie to see what these policies are that everyone is putting forth, and really hold people accountable.”

Rising juniors Govind Menon, an information systems major, and Emma Cohron, a computer science major, are running for Student Body President and Vice President. Menon is the vice president of the debate team, a chair member of business fraternity Alpha Kappa Psi, and a member of the Committee on Student Organizations. Cohron is the Vice President of administration for Delta Delta Delta, an orientation counselor, and a TA for 15-150. Currently, they're both stuck in their homes in New York and New Jersey, respectively, so they developed a platform that focuses on three overarching issues: “Diversity and equity,” “unity across campus,” and “our responsibility.”
On their website under the “Diversity” header, they write that one goal of their administration is to establish a gender neutral bathroom in each building on campus. Additionally, they hope to give preference to students with second languages in the hiring process for orientation to help with the transition of international students. A recent issue around diversity at Carnegie Mellon, the map in the Cohon Center, escaped mention in the diversity section of their website, but Menon expanded on diversity priorities of the student government. He said that he discussed the list of priorities with current student body president Evan Feder: “I was talking to Evan...to find out what he thinks his administration could have done better and what we can try to help add to.”
To develop unity across campus, Menon and Cohron want to add a Bee Garden to the extant Peace Garden next to Hunt Library, add Oomf charging stations across campus, and develop a weekly club mailer. The Bee Garden is a sustainability initiative that is supported by campus group Sustainable Earth, and they hope to add more laminated posters above compostable bins across campus, while also trying to add more bins. Oomf chargers, currently in use at Chapman University, allow students to sign out portable chargers and use them anywhere on campus. Cohron said that the lack of outlets across campus is a big issue to students: “We really think it fills a need the student body has, especially in places like Tepper where there is not a lot of outlets to use, but a lot of people do want to go work there.”
Additionally, Menon and Cohron hope to add free menstrual products across campus, push for equitable TA wages, live stream student government cabinet meetings, and develop a clothing drive for students who are ill-equipped for Pittsburgh winters without the financial means to purchase winter clothing. 
They are also pushing for a student speaker series in front of the Board of Trustees and better advertising for the Emergency Student Loan program, which has recently been expanded to the Tartan Emergency Support Fund in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On putting more students in front of the Board of Trustees, Menon says, “You need a greater voice from the student perspective...trying to put someone who knows what the current issues are in that room is pretty important.”
The Menon and Cohron campaign is looking to make the most of their time in the presidency, and they are focused on taking certain policies developed by the previous administration through their next phases. Namely, the Bee Garden, the Oomf chargers, the expanded accessibility to student government, and the clothing drive are policies that could be made actionable within their time as president and vice president.

Kendra Adegbesan and Alejandro Garces are running for Student Body President and Vice President. Their campaign proposals fall into five themes, “Equity and Inclusion,” “A Community Connected,” “Interdisciplinary Recognition,” “Student Employment,” and “Sustainability,” as written on the campaign’s website.
Kendra Adegbesan, a junior studying neurobiology, creative writing, and film, has been a member of the Undergraduate Senate for five semesters, three of them acting as the Senate financial chair. 
Adegbesan told The Tartan in an interview that the role of student body president “requires you to be able to speak on the student perspective, the entire student perspective, whenever, as actively and effectively as you can.” Her job as student leader would be “talking, and talking, and discussing, and talking, and bringing forth points that I know are well researched and well supported throughout the student body.”
Students “have a lot more input than I think we realize, but a lot of that, I think, again, is because people don't know what their student government is doing,” Adegbesan said, explaining that central to her campaign is the aim to change how student government addresses representation and collaboration. 
For the past three semesters, Adegbesan has been the Senate’s Finance Chair. This experience put her in the center of communication with student organizations. “I have a lot of experience trying to figure out how to balance preferences, and how to come to the best conclusion for a group of people, whether that be 40 or 14,000. I can do both very well,” she said.
The policies Adegbesan and Garces propose cover several parts of the campus. To name a few, they want to start a commission for multicultural organizations to, as the website states, “honor, address, correct issues and concerns minority culture groups often face on campus.” They want to initiate an undergraduate and graduate student “connections program” to bridge the gap between campus members. They want to see an expansion of sustainable campus practices, including creating a university Department of Sustainability. They want to improve on the student employment model. 
On how these policies would get done, Adegbesan told The Tartan that “one of the fantastic privileges that the student body president has is to get a meeting with any person they have to in the administration.” She says she’d work hard at “representing the student voice and student interests… talking to [the administration], informing them about things that we want, or things that are important to us.” 
When asked what sets her apart from the other three candidates, Adegbesan said, “I know the ins and outs of student government, I know when it needs to change, and I know what actually can be done to help the student experience. I've been working on [these things] since I joined Senate, and now I'll just have the opportunity to actually see these things come to fruition.” A lot of the job of student body president, Adegbesan told The Tartan, is meeting with “a lot of people way above your paygrade,” representing the student body, and representing the university. “And as I've already done that… many of the same people that I talked to in [previous] positions are people that are happy to talk to me right now.”
Adegbesan’s pick for Vice President, Alejandro Garces, is a junior who also studies biology. He doesn’t have the experience Adegbesan has in student government, but he has had other leadership roles. He’s currently the brotherhood chair for the Phi Delta Theta chapter, is a member of the Spanish and Latin Student Association, and was selected to be an Orientation Counselor this year. Adegbesan said that while she is very informed about the ins-and-outs of student government, what Garces offers is that he knows more about what goes on outside of student government. “He’s very well connected on campus, and in a lot of different organizations, and he has a very good ear. So the two of us together work very effectively,” Adegbesan said.
“All of the candidates for Student Body President and Vice President are fantastic, amazing people, and I think the university is going to be in good hands with every single one of them,” Adegbesan told The Tartan. “But there’s one pair that they would be in great hands with.”

Improving student experience with stress and mental health has motivated much of the work that Zeke Maroclo-Kemmerling, a junior majoring in Biological Physics, has done in Student Senate. After seeing David Cresswell’s effort at quantifying aspects of the student experience in the Life@CMU study, Maroclo-Kemmerling chose to join Student Senate via a vacancy election to help with these issues, which he says have impacted him personally.  
The issue of combatting overwork culture is now a distinguishing part of Maroclo-Kemmerling’s platform in his campaign for Student Body President. Maroclo-Kemmerling sees “overwork culture” as an umbrella term that can address many of the different pressures Carnegie Mellon students often talk about, from stress culture to sleep culture. 
After Cresswell’s Life@CMU study reported that students experienced similar levels of stress to other universities,  Maroclo-Kemmerling observed that some tried to shift the conversation from helping address the cause of student stress to shifting student’s perspectives on their own workload. “The university is taking the stance that if we just change the context, then the culture will realign proportionally,” said Maroclo-Kemmerling, “And I think that's a good step. But I think you need a more institutional level change as well. And where I really want to get work done is in the policy that can help make this easier for students.” 
“I want to institute academic policies that would be more universal,” says Maroclo-Kemmerling, “but allow enough breathing room for professors to do their own thing, but would require professors to be more conscientious.” He acknowledges that changing academic policy is a “dangerous road to run down,” but thinks that facilitating conversations about what standardized policy should look like will help close the gap between faculty and student’s perspectives on academics. 
Maroclo-Kemmerling gained experience navigating the complicated world of academic policy during his time on the Academic Affairs Committee in Student Senate, where he worked with others on the committee in continuing to negotiate the terms of the add/drop deadline, understanding student needs when it comes to access to online learning resources, establishing college-level career resources, and suggesting ways to align prerequisite requirements with the actual demands of the course. 
Maroclo-Kemmerling took on initiatives outside of his committee as well, passing a policy with the Advocacy Committee to work with SLICE and the Office of Title IX Initiatives to integrate more concrete policies surrounding sexual assault and relationship violence into clubs.  Sexual assault is rarely discussed in clubs, says Maroclo-Kemmerling, and awareness and reporting mechanisms are currently “very touch and go, and var[y] greatly based on the clubs themselves.”
Maroclo-Kemmerling is also proposing increasing access to student government by implementing office hours for the Student Body President like the ones Provost Jim Garrett has begun to hold. 
Maroclo-Kemmerling has also made including more graduate students in his cabinet a facet of his platform. He was careful to note that there are parts of the graduate student experience, such as their dual status as employees and students, that he hasn’t encountered as an undergraduate. “The easiest, most direct way to deal with that is to encompass, to integrate, that experience more intimately with you and your presidency and your cabinet,” said Maroclo-Kemmerling.
To close our interview, Maroclo-Kemmerling wanted to highlight the role that the student body president could have in increasing involvement in the wider Pittsburgh community. 
“CMU as a research university has a vast array of resources and influence that would just be such great benefit to the the community and to the city. And, clearly we don't always do right by them,” says Maroclo-Kemmerling. An important part of his platform, says Maroclo-Kemmerling, is to “make sure the university stays committed, and make sure that we as students and faculty can find ways to contribute to the community.”

Ethan Rich, a rising senior in electrical and computer engineering, is running for Student Body Vice President of Organizations. Rich has been in a number of leadership roles across campus, including Concerts Chair for the Activities Board, Housing and Dining Chair for the Student Dormitory Council, Finance Committee Chair in the Undergraduate Student Senate, and the station manager of the Carnegie Tech Radio Club. 
The Vice President of Organizations is responsible for leading the Committee on Student Organizations (CoSO), which recognizes campus organizations based on their constitution. Usually, the committee’s job ends there, but Rich wants to turn the members of the committee into advocates or advisers for student organizations. In an email to The Tartan, Rich wrote, “I would like to have more written material about an organization's activities whether it’s minutes from GBMs or notes from a CoSO rep at an org’s event. The collection and sharing of this data will allow student government to make more informed choices about organizations.”
Some of those choices include the distribution of funds from the Joint Funding Committe (JFC). Currently, the JFC sees a small blurb about each student organization to determine the distribution of monies collected out of the Student Activities Fee. Rich wants to make sure each organization gets a fair shake from the JFC by providing more information via the advisers on the CoSO. Another goal from his platform is to establish joint JFC-CoSO meetings to help the JFC understand more closely the workings of each organization on campus. 
Another goal of Rich’s is to expand space in the Cohon Center for student organizations. Cohon Center office re-allocation will not occur during the next year, but the Vice President of Organizations can work to build more cabinet space or locker space in the Cohon Center. “This would benefit smaller organizations that historically would not be able to utilize a space in the UC, but still require a small amount of storage,” Rich told The Tartan. 
Additionally, Rich hopes to make the transition between student leaders for clubs smoother by changing the Tartan Leadership Conference to be more useful for organizations. According to his platform, Rich wishes to provide more resources about The Bridge, organization financing, and room reservation without the time commitment required by the current incarnation of the Tartan Leadership Conference. 
With his experience across various organizations on campus and his experience in student government, Rich believes he will be able to help students make the most of the activities fee, and even if that means hours of meetings on a Saturday, Rich will do what he can to make sure that new student organizations will be recognized as swiftly as possible.

Imran Hyder, a sophomore majoring in economics and philosophy, is running for Student Body Vice President of Organizations (SBVPO). Hyder has been part of CMU Debate for two years, and is the recruitment chair for Sigma Chi. The main theme of his candidacy is streamlining the bureaucratic procedures affecting campus organizations.
“What I offer is that there are a lot of people who could do the duties of the SBVPO, but my pitch to the Carnegie Mellon community is reimagining the position and reimagining the systems that are in place to reinvigorate the position and the organizations on campus,” Hyder said. “We can have a lot more organizations on campus. We can do a lot more by streamlining all of these processes.”
Hyder’s decision to run for SBVPO was born in part out of a high school hobby. “All through high school, I did this thing called ethics-bowl… In debate, you are assigned to a position which you are forced to argue, whereas in an ethics bowl competition, it’s more about what you believe and the quandaries, so it’s more about what you think is actually right,” Hyder said in an interview with the Tartan.
“It all started when I tried to start [an ethics bowl] at Carnegie Mellon. I realized that [starting a club] seems as though there is a pretty easy process, but I sent over three emails, two Facebook messages, followed someone on Instagram, and I couldn’t even get a response about starting a student body organization. After thinking about it for a long time I decided to pursue for myself the position [SBVPO] because I believe I have a lot of ideas as to how to improve the position and how it can be done better.”
Hyder’s ordeal trying to create an organization was partly caused by the procedures for forming an organization at Carnegie Mellon. Currently, you must reach out to a few people to start the process of making a constitution for an organization, and ensuring a timely response can be hard without a formal contact process. 
“A lot of the SBVPOs have been trying to find ways to streamline the process of [recognition and] re-recognition of clubs, so I want to continue that trend”, Hyder said.
Hyder plans to change this system by making a dedicated SBVPO website, with an abundance of information on forming organizations, re-recognizing organizations, contacting the SBVPO, and on the various forms that must be filled out.
According to Hyder, the re-recognition process is problematic not because clubs are struggling to get re-recognized, but rather that the process simply takes too long for club leaders.
“Your priorities as a club leader should be your priorities in terms of ‘oh I want to schedule more debates,’ your priority shouldn’t be that you have to dedicate this amount of time towards re-recognition; it should take 15 to 20 minutes. There are forms, meetings, and maybe even an audit, so a lot of the process is internal and takes time. So one of my priorities would be streamlining it.”
Another issue Hyder has championed is a more guided constitution-drafting process. Currently, clubs have to meet with the SBVPO, who will explain the guidelines for drafting a constitution, and they are sent off to write it, after which it will either be accepted or rejected by the committee in charge of these matters. Hyder plans for one of these committees to be appointed to advise the writers of the constitution while they are drafting it, so that they are not submitting their constitution blindly. 
Hyder wants to make sure that students who are organizing a club can do so easily and fruitfully.
