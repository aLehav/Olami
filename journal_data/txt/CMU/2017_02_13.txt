The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team began Alumni Weekend by putting away a wire-to-wire victory against the Brandeis Judges on Friday, snapping a four-game losing streak.
The Tartans moved their record to 16–5 overall and 5–5 in the University Athletic Association (UAA) for the season.
The game started auspiciously for the Tartans. After winning the opening tip, the Tartans whipped the ball around the perimeter for the full shot clock, finally finding first-year guard Makayla Filliere for a long three that found the bottom of the net.
Filliere added a jumper from the left corner and another from the free throw line in an opening run that gave the Tartans an early 14–6 lead.
It wasn’t all smooth sailing for the Tartans. Their 2–3 zone stifled plenty of Brandeis’ possessions, but it also created space for offensive rebounds.
Brandeis was able to use a run built on several second chance points to climb all the way to 17–16 before the Tartans put up a 9–2 run to stop the bleeding.
The Tartans did give up one more second chance bucket at the end of the first quarter and went into the second up 26–20.
The second quarter did not open well for Carnegie Mellon as a few turnovers let Brandeis cut the Tartans’ lead in half in the middle of the second quarter.
The tide turned as the Tartans were getting more successful with their rebounding by going after missed shots more aggressively. In addition, senior center Lisa Murphy’s rim protection went from tough to dominant in the second quarter.
Even offensive rebounds were turning into difficult, contested shots that Brandeis wasn’t able to bury.
Murphy finished with seven blocks, completely cutting off the restricted area for Brandeis players.
Offensively, Murphy helped key a 12–2 run that gave the Tartans a 43–30 lead at the half, including a layup that came off a drop step to cap off the run at the buzzer. No matter who Brandeis sent to stop Murphy in the post, Murphy was stronger and more able to take the precise steps necessary to play down low.
When Brandeis sent double teams, Murphy was an effective playmaker, racking up four assists and plenty more hockey assists.
Brandeis had no answer for her on either end, and she was able to collect 15 rebounds and 22 points on only 13 shots.
The Tartans also went on a run in the first half of the third quarter, extending their lead to 20 points before the final period began.
While Murphy was dominant on the low block, the Tartans’ successful offense had a huge assist from excellent three-point shooting, finishing around 40 percent for the game.
Filliere finished hitting three of four from deep while sophomore guard Jenn Mayberger added another three. Carnegie Mellon’s ball movement stood in stark contrast the more dribble-based play from the Judges and it showed in the shooting stats.
In all, the Tartans’ nine shots made out of 23 attempts from three point range towered over Brandeis’s two out of 10 and the difference was more than the margin of victory.
The Tartans will continue their season on Friday, Feb. 17 when they take on Rochester in a rematch of their game on Jan. 20. The Tartans won that game at home 71–62.

On Friday, the Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team battled the Brandeis University Judges in a University Athletic Association (UAA) rivalry game, coming away with the victory.
The game began with the Judges making two three-pointers and building a fast lead. Both teams established the quick pace of the game with powerful defensive play. At 15:29, a dunk by senior center Chris Shkil on a fast break opened the game up the Tartans, who soon scored several consecutive baskets to take the lead early in the first half. Though the Tartans missed several second chance shots after offensive rebounds, they continued to play aggressively on both sides of the ball. With precise passing in the paint and by taking advantage of chances at the free throw line, the Tartans maintained a small lead. Three quarters of the way through the half, the quick scoring slowed down, and the defense took over the game. The Judges evened the score twice, but the Tartans found a way to take the lead both times. Sophomore forward and guard Seth Henry scored a three-pointer at the end of the half, just beating the buzzer. Carnegie Mellon led 37–29.
Carnegie Mellon scored the first points of the second half, amassing a 17-point lead early, with the Tartans’ offense taking control of the game as it had in the first half. Though the Tartans sustained a double-digit advantage over Brandeis for much of the half, the Judges inched their way back, scoring 10 points to 1, and by the midpoint, had closed in on the Tartan’s lead. At 10:36, a technical foul by the Carnegie Mellon coach allowed the Judges to cut the deficit to 9 points. The Tartans refused to let the Judges take over the game, surging to score 13 unanswered points and building a 22-point lead with 6:39 left to play. The Tartans had as much as a 24-point lead as the game came to a close. They held on to win 78–64.
Senior forward Jack Serbin and Shkil both recorded double-doubles. After being named the UAA Athlete of the Week on Tuesday, Serbin scored 16 points with 16 rebounds. Shkil led the team with 21 points and added 12 rebounds. As a team, Carnegie Mellon had a better night statistically than Brandeis, with a 45 percent field goal rate compared to the Judges’ 36.5 percent. The Tartans also had more rebounds, 42 to 31, assists, 16 to 12, second chance points, 10 to 2, and points in the paint, 26 to 12. The Judges’ field goal percentage in three-pointers was 42.3 percent, much higher than the Tartans’ 27.3 percent, and they took more three-point shots overall. However, the Tartans committed fewer turnovers and scored more points off of turnovers than Brandeis did. Leading for most of the game, the Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team had a dominant performance over the Brandeis Judges.
On Sunday, the Tartans took on New York University. The Tartans  came away with a 94–58 victory, bringing their record to 13–9 overall and 7–4 in the UAA.
After a missed three-pointer by NYU to start the game, Shkil made a layup off a Serbin assist, and the Tartans never looked back. After NYU’s first points answered the Tartans’ ten, senior forward Joseph Cossins’ first long ball on the ensuing possession put the Tartans ahead 13–3 and never saw the lead dip below double digits the rest of the day. Carnegie Mellon’s largest lead of the first half came in the closing second of play when junior guard Ryan Maha scored on a layup, as the teams went into the locker room with the score 47–22. Carnegie Mellon started the second half making eight of its first 10 shots and led 67–33 with 13:28 to play. With 4:46 to play, a fast break layup by Shkil gave the Tartans their largest lead of the game at 88–46. Carnegie Mellon shot a season-best 57.6 percent from the floor while holding the Violets to 31.3 percent from the floor.
Serbin grabbed a game-high 13 rebounds to record his third straight double-double and UAA leading 14th. Shkil chipped in with 16 points, had eight rebounds, and recorded four blocks in the win.
The team continues the season against the University of Rochester at 8 p.m. on Friday, Feb. 17.

On Sunday, Feb. 5, 111.3 million people with almost as many levels of football knowledge watched Super Bowl LI. The game started as a blowout for the Atlanta Falcons, but the New England Patriots managed to pull off the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history, forcing overtime for the first time in the Super Bowl en route to their fifth Super Bowl victory.
The outcome generated a number of awkward moments with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, perhaps the most fitting response for the way he handled the 2015 Deflategate scandal.
For quite a large portion of the time, the game itself was rather boring, so the other aspects of the big game took the stage. The halftime show headlined by Lady Gaga most certainly drew the attention of fans and detractors alike, even if others like me were more invested in taking the opportunity to prepare something to eat or use the bathroom instead.
However, the halftime show still took up only the time between the end of the second quarter and the start of the third.
For those who wanted entertainment during the game but either didn’t care enough about football or just weren’t interested in the game being played out, the ads were the spotlight of the show.
According to a 2014 survey conducted by ad agency Venables Bell & Partners, 78 percent of Americans look forward to the commercials more than the game itself.
In an age where ad blocking is popular and advertisers are seen as annoying and potentially compromising safety, it’s almost as if the Super Bowl is a holiday for advertising, the one day in the year people will accommodate advertisements as an essential part of the whole experience. It’s no wonder the price for a 30 second ad spot has reached $5 million.
For years, the top advertisements in the Super Bowl have generally revolved around comedy and animals. However, it seems this year’s ads have been headlined by the political tones surrounding them. An Audi ad featured a father considering how his daughter would be viewed as less valuable than a man to highlight the wage gap between men and women. A Budweiser ad which showcased the story of its founder’s path to achieving the American Dream generated boycott threats over its tone on the value of immigration. 10 Haircare urged viewers to make up for “four years of awful hair,” a humorous reference to President Trump’s infamous hair.
Perhaps the most controversial ad came from 84 Lumber. Titled “The Journey”, the ad showed a mother and a daughter journeying across the Mexican desert on the way to the United States. Viewing the full ad online reveals that they eventually reach an impasse in the form of a wall, but manage to sneak in through a door made from 84 Lumber materials. “The will to succeed is always welcomed here,” closed out the ad. The tumultuous election cycle that led to Trump’s electoral win over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has no doubt shone a greater focus onto the issues facing the country, and it’s no secret that the NFL has been a part of politics for years.
In 2014, the St. Louis Rams (now Los Angeles Rams) made hands up gestures in reference to the "Hands Up, Don't Shoot" cry that drove protests in Ferguson following the death of Michael Brown.
San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has been well documented for his protest of the national anthem.
Many fans were enraged when the NFL denied a request by the Dallas Cowboys to wear stickers in support of the Dallas Police Department.
It seems that politics have become entwined in football, and this is now showing in the way companies have been approaching ads.
Quite a number of ads stuck with the tried and true formula of comedy and lighthearted presentations with celebrities to push their companies’ products. However, it seems like a greater number of people are focused on politics now that Donald Trump has become the president of the United States.
Whether this is good or bad depends on perspective. Some people would prefer having politics out of their entertainment, while others might welcome any avenue that promotes discussion about the issues the country is facing.
The world has certainly recognized the gravity of recent events.
Perhaps it is time the Super Bowl recognized it too.

New test detects Ebola quickly
Scientists are currently developing a new test that has the potential to rapidly detect Ebola, the virus that causes a number of potentially fatal symptoms, including fever, vomiting, diarrhea and internal bleeding.
According to the World Health Organization, there are no licensed cures for Ebola, although two are undergoing human safety testing. Currently, Ebola is detected by examining genetic material; it takes an entire day to detect and the samples must be examined in a specialized laboratory.
Researchers reported the new test on Feb. 6 at the American Society for Microbiology Biothreats meeting. They are examining the use of antibodies that latch onto the virus and flag it — much like a pregnancy test. One antibody, containing gold nanoparticles, forcibly removes the virus particles from the sample, while another reveals the virus’ presence in the form of a colored line. By dabbing a patient’s blood onto a paper containing the antibodies, the colored line will appear either confirming or denying the virus’ presence after 10 to 15 minutes.
However, immunologist Haley DeMers of the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine says that the test only gives accurate results once a patient has been sick for a long time. DeMers and her colleges are currently testing different antibodies to find the most efficient and effective combination.

United Nations Secretary General calls for more women in STEM
On Saturday, Feb. 7, the annual International Day of Women and Girls in Science, the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General António Guterres called for more investment to teach science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to girls and women worldwide, and more equal access.
“For too long, discriminatory stereotypes have prevented women and girls from having equal access to education in science, technology, engineering and math,” said Mr. Guterres in his message. “On this International Day, I urge commitment to end bias, greater investments in STEM education for all women and girls as well as opportunities for their careers and longer-term professional advancement so that all can benefit from their ground-breaking future contributions.”
The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) released its annual science report earlier this week titled 'Towards 2030' which featured a section called 'Global Trends in Human Capital,' noting that women are a minority in the research world, have more limited access to funding than men, and are less represented as faculty at prestigious universities.
“This should be a wake-up call,” UNESCO said. “Female participation is falling in a field that is expanding globally as its importance for national economies grows, penetrating every aspect of daily life.”

Rabies is a potential solution to brain cancer
Researchers are looking into a seemingly unconventional way to treat brain cancer – through rabies. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, rabies is a viral disease transmitted from wild animal bites. 
It holds interest among researchers primarily due to its capability to infect the central nervous system. Normally, this will infect brain tissue, causing disease in the brain and resulting in death. Scientists are trying to mimic this capability in order to infect brain tumors with tumor-killing nanoparticles.
Researchers from Sungkyunkwan University in Suwon, South Korea are engineering gold nanoparticles that have the same shape and size as the rabies virus, giving the particle more surface area. This allows for more receptors to bind to nerve cells. The nanoparticles themselves do not carry any drug, instead relying on heat produced from the gold rods absorbing light to kill surrounding tissue.
Currently, this approach works only in mice. Major concerns regarding this method include whether the nanoparticles actually make it to the tumor, side effects and potential toxicity from the rabies virus.

SpaceX launch to bring more scientific hardware to ISS
SpaceX is currently preparing for the launch of its Falcon 9 rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Feb. 18. This launch signifies SpaceX’s tenth resupply mission for the International Space Station (ISS). The Dragon Spacecraft will carry cargo for the mission, including more than 5500 lbs. of new scientific hardware.
Onboard the craft will be the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS), developed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and the University of Alabama. LIS detects lightning over a larger geographic area and can help scientists and meteorologists understand weather forecasting, climate change, atmospheric chemistry and physics, and aircraft and spacecraft safety.
'Nanobiosym' is an experiment that will look into how microgravity affects the growth and mutation of a superbug, which is a bacterium that rapidly mutates in order to resist antibiotics.
Another interesting project is Raven, which is a robotic system that will be installed on the ISS in order to observe facets of any approaching vehicles. Autonomously, the ISS will then gimbal or pivot autonomously for rendezvous.

Autonomous cars to create organ shortage
As autonomous vehicles become the norm in the future, the roads will arguably be a safer place, resulting in fewer accidents and less death. However, while less death is always good from a humanitarian perspective, it may not be from an organ donation perspective.
According to national data from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), 13.6 percent of people who donated organs after they died in 2016 were killed in automobile accidents. There are over 120,000 people on an organ transplant list a day, and not nearly enough organs to go around.
Science offers another solution to this organ shortage – 3D printing and other bioengineering technologies. There are a number of different ways researchers are looking into organ transplant – one is to regrow the organ using stem cells and avoid replacement altogether. Another is to build new organs using tissue scaffolds and stem cells or 3D printing and use those for transplantation.
Some organs are easier to recreate than others; the heart is currently one of the most difficult. This field of modern research could make drastic improvements on the current organ shortage. With science, it’s a win-win situation.

Head-dress figurine discovered in 17000 year-old tomb
Archaeologists have discovered a 1700 year-old tomb during an expedition to remodel a Seventh-day Adventist church in Colima, Mexico. The tomb dates between 0 and 500 A.D. during the Comala Period.
The tomb is broken up into three burial layers. In the first layer, the archaeologists found 12 skulls and other human bones piled atop each other. According to Rosa María Flores Ramírez, a physical anthropologist at the National Institute of Anthropology and History in Mexico, some of the skulls showed damage such as tooth fractures and wear. The second burial level contained a male and female figurine placed face down next to two more skulls and several pots. Both figurines were sculpted from fine paste and adorned with elaborate headdresses.
The fact that the tomb was found untouched is very rare – more often than not, tombs are found already looted. This gave the archaeologists "a first approach with the bone remains, to observe the lesions, deformations and to have more information to know what was their way of life," the researchers said in the statement.

Carnegie Mellon Ph.D. candidate Madeline Gannon combined her creativity with computational design knowledge for her project, Mimus. On display in a glass box at the Design Museum London is an ABB IRB 6700 robot, normally found on assembly lines in factories. The robot interacts with passersby much like a curious animal in a zoo does, bringing it to life with character. The Design Museum has displayed contemporary art related to industrial design for almost four decades. The exhibition is titled [Fear and Love: Reactions to a Complex World.] 
Gannon wishes to highlight the empathy humans can develop with robots. "Creating new ways to communicate with machines is my passion," said Gannon in a Carnegie Mellon press release. "When something responds to us with lifelike movements — even when it is clearly an inanimate object — we, as humans, cannot help but project our emotions onto it." 
The name "Mimus" is derived from the Latin word for mimic and a gens of the bird family, highlighting its mirror-like and its sentient behavior. As robots become more intertwined in our everyday lives, the need for them to react normally to human interaction will increase. Autodesk vice president Amar Hanspal commented on Mimus and the connection between machines and people, saying "Madeline and Mimus highlight how that new relationship can emerge." Justin McGuirk, chief curator for the Design Museum, also said "One starts to get the sense of how robots may behave in the future."
The robot relies on gesture-based software and depth sensors to determine its actions. It then uses simulation algorithms to determine its reactions; nothing is premeditated. Other students and alumni helped in creating Mimus, including Kevyn McPhail, Ben Snell, and Dan Moore.
Gannon's work is a reply to the misunderstanding that came with automation and the job loss that followed. Robots replaced factories workers at an alarming rate because they are more accurate, do not require wages and work at maximum performance for hours. Despite laying off workers, production has grown at a 2.2 percent rate per year since 2002.
The exhibition is open until April 23. There are 11 other installations alongside Mimus that focus on modern-world advances.

On Tuesday, Feb. 7, Dr. Thomas S. Mullaney, Associate Professor of Chinese History at Stanford University, visited Carnegie Mellon University to discuss the history and development of Chinese computing, the topic of his upcoming book, The Chinese Typewriter. Mullaney specializes in the fields of East Asia, the History of Science, and Global History, and received his PhD from Columbia University. His works have been published in Journal of Asian Studies, The Atlantic, and the Los Angeles Times.
Invited to Pittsburgh by Carnegie Mellon’s Department of History, Mullaney presented his lecture, “The Ecologies of Chinese Computing.” He began by first explaining the fundamental difference between the characters of the Chinese language, and the letters of the Latin alphabet that dominate the Western world. There is no such thing as “typing” in Chinese. The language is written electronically by input, retrieving information from a database to print something on paper or on screen.
When Chinese linguists began to develop the Chinese typewriter in the early 20th century, Mullaney explained, they considered the basic idea of typing: what you type is what you get. In the 1940s, Lin Yutang, a Chinese linguist and inventor, introduced the concept of putting only the radicals that make up characters and several common characters on a keyboard because it is impossible to fit over 50,000 characters on a keyboard, compared to the 26 characters of the Latin alphabet. Instead, a typewriter would have a database of characters and parts of characters from which a writer would retrieve by pressing the keys.
Many different innovations have contributed to the progression of Chinese computing throughout the 20th century. One innovation Mullaney presented was predictive text, which placed characters next to each other that were commonly used together. For example, each of the characters in the name 'Mao Zedong' were spread apart on the keyboard, but through predictive text, were organized next to each other, which lends to quicker, more efficient typing. Another innovation was autocompletion, similar to today’s autocorrect. Because Chinese languages are not necessarily spelt, the concept of autocompletion is a retrieval mechanism. Not all of the parts of a character are needed to arrive at an unambiguous location in the character database to print the desired character.
Mullaney continued his argument by discussing the keyboard that the Chinese government developed in the closing years of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976). This keyboard had 256 keys, some with full-body characters, but mostly with bits and pieces of characters, bringing back Lin Yutang’s original ideas thirty years later. This keyboard was considered a medium-sized keyboard in comparison to the QWERTY keyboard used in the West. 
To bring his lecture to the present day, Mullaney conceded that in the 1990s, the Chinese input system slowly began to look just like the QWERTY keyboard. However, he labeled this era as “a nervous system of Input Wars,” when hundreds of different input systems in China were competing with one another all while standardization was becoming more common. Most of these systems were structure-based systems, not the Pinyin system — the input of romanized Chinese characters by pronunciation that we see so commonly today. One structure-based system still prominent today is the Wubi input system, which is much faster and transcends specific dialect pronunciation.
Mullaney also explained other input systems, such as shaped-based retrieval, which assigned characters to a particular shape of Latin characters, and the Double-pinyin method, which used Latin letters as variables for different elements of Chinese pronunciation. Though they are not in use, these systems are a testament of the creativity of Chinese linguists in a globalized world dominated by Latin languages, especially English.
Despite the prevalent use of the Pinyin system, Mullaney stressed that we should not assume that the 'phoneticization' of characters is complete or concrete. On the contrary, he said, the capacity of structure-based systems such as Wubi is great, beginning with their efficiency. 
At the end of his lecture, Mullaney challenged the audience to think about how Chinese computing has evolved, and how it will continue to evolve in the face of constant technological advancement. Mullaney’s upcoming book, The Chinese Typewriter, will be released in the summer of 2017.

The commercial airliner Concorde, commissioned in 1976, once traversed the Atlantic in a little less than three and a half hours. The result of British Airways and Air France collaboration, the supersonic plane demonstrated how small we could make the world. Achieving supersonic flight not only demanded engineering and design creativity, but also introduced a great deal of risk as well. How did the Concorde fly faster than the speed of sound, and why couldn't it last?
The jet engines that thrust the plane forward were the twin Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593s. Producing up to 142 kN, the titanium engines were designed to withstand high temperatures and pressure. It worked by taking in air at high speed and pressure, then compressing it through seven stages. The compressed air was then mixed with jet fuel and ignited. The ignition was released from the engine nozzles, creating forward thrust. The engine pushed the Concorde from takeoff speeds of 200 mph to Mach 2.04 speeds, more than twice the speed of sound (Mach 1) and almost 1,400 mph.
The Concorde’s ability to achieve supersonic speed was partially thanks to the design of its body. The aircraft sat a hundred passengers and was not as spacious as usual 100-seater planes. This is because the plane’s cabin had a small circumference, which mathematical models determined was optimal for such speeds. The wings of the plane resembled those of the Space Shuttle, yet were curved along their perimeter to reduce drag forces and generate more uplift. The plane’s long, sharp nose was a disadvantage for pilots when taking off, as it blocked their view. This was fixed by enabling the nose to adjust mechanically, referred to as a droop nose.
Supersonic speed came with many problems. The plane’s surface created so much friction with the fast-moving air molecules that passengers admitted to feeling heat on the window panes. Drag forces at such high speeds created incredible stresses and strains on the body of the aircraft, causing it to bend up to two meters during banking. Engineers solved this issue by adjusting the center of mass of the plane through the redistributing of fuel in the wings and tail.
The supersonic jet had to fly at high altitudes where the atmosphere is much less dense. At 60,000 feet, or 11 miles into the air, the plane experienced much less drag force. Passengers noted that they could see the curvature of the Earth from such a height. In comparison, subsonic commercial planes fly below 30,000 feet. An extremely disastrous consequence of the Concorde’s high altitude was the damage its exhaust had on the ozone layer.
Another issue the Concorde had to deal with was its sonic boom, the sound associated with the shock waves left behind an object traveling faster than the speed of sound. It is caused when the sound waves, which travel at Mach 1, that are emitted at the front of a supersonic object merge into one super shock wave; it is as though the waves cannot move from the object’s path quickly enough. It resembles a loud crack, capable of shattering windows below. Therefore, the airliner was not allowed to reach supersonic speeds until it was above ocean.
The Concorde is a reminder of many things. It demonstrated how engineering, and especially international collaboration in engineering, can produce cutting-edge technology. It also proved to us that the world can be made even smaller, and travel more time-effective. Yet, it reminded us that no matter how much a product pushes the envelope, it will not last if it does not have a good business model. Running a supersonic commercial jet was unimaginably costly, with many faulty parts and expensive tickets. A fatal crash of the Concorde in 2000 also withdrew public support for the plane. 
Today, planes fly well below the speed of sound and, to many, it seems a downgrade. Until a supersonic jet is designed that addresses the engineering and business issues the Concorde faced, we will live in the aviation stone age, spending six hours in transit from New York to London.

Uber has hired veteran NASA engineer Mark Moore as its Director of Engineering for Aviation to help realize its long-term program for developing flying car technology.
Moore's move to Uber follows 30 years of research at NASA, working with electric motors in vertical takeoff and landing vehicles (VTOLs), which are flying vehicles. He made the switch because he believes Uber's vision for accessible, affordable flying cars is achievable: “I can’t think of another company in a stronger position to be the leader for this new ecosystem and make the urban electric VTOL market real," he told Bloomberg.
Moore's 2010 research paper on electrically powered VTOL technology inspired startups and aviation companies to investigate the technology he described. Several tech companies are currently developing VTOL concepts both in the US and abroad, some funded by high-profile tech entrepreneurs like Google co-founder Larry Page.
Moore previously worked as a consultant for Uber when the company first released the white paper on its vision for VTOL vehicles, Uber Elevate. 
Uber's ultimate goal is to eliminate practical barriers to VTOL use so that it can offer a VTOL service to allow quick commutes in metropolitan areas, even those with heavy traffic. As the white paper on Uber Elevate explains, "Just as skyscrapers allowed cities to use limited land more efficiently, urban air transportation will use three-dimensional airspace to alleviate transportation congestion on the ground."
Uber Elevate is not necessarily working towards building a prototype vehicle; instead, its aim is to identify and resolve the practical barriers to implementing a system of VTOLs in an urban environment. Some of these concerns include safety protocols for urban airspace, regulations for potential harmful emissions, noise pollution issues, and affordability for the consumer: concerns which Moore will presumably help address in his new position.
Though the technological and logistical concerns highlighted by Uber Elevate are significant, they are not insurmountable. After all, urban airspace is already used frequently by helicopters, and increasingly by drones, with little issue. And though a VTOL taxi service would be expensive at first, Uber estimates that once it has implemented an infrastructure of "vertiports" for takeoff and landing, a ride in a flying vehicles might cost no more than a trip in an Uber does today.
In fact, Moore predicts that flying vehicles controlled by humans will be in the testing phase within one to three years, and Uber projects that they will begin offering VTOL rides in some cities within the next five to ten years.

Light in the Attic Records just rereleased Lee Hazlewood’s out-of-print 1972 album 13, a work rooted in the political turmoil, cynicism, and paranoia of the early 70s during Nixon. Hazlewood, best known for producing Nancy Sinatra’s “These Boots Are Made for Walkin,’” recorded many solo albums in the 60s and 70s, characterized by his distinctive baritone voice and idiosyncratic production skills on lush lounge, bubblegum pop music, and folky, country tunes. 13, stands out rather starkly in musical direction from Hazlewood’s other albums as he explores the soul-funk idiom. While the songs feature the type of seedy characters often found on his records, the seediness is especially pronounced on 13 as funk instrumentation like fuzz and wah-wah guitar with brass, organ, elastic bass, and a solid beat, provides music reminiscent of the era’s grindhouse films.
​*13* originally only saw release in a limited number of countries excluding the United States. It was released on CD in the early 2000s, but again on a limited basis, so this is the first time that the album is widely available. Hazlewood lived and worked in the US, throughout the 60s, but started traveling the world on the business of his independent production label Lee Hazlewood Industries (LHI). Fed up with what amounted to minor success in the US, Hazlewood found he had a following in Sweden and decided to settle there in the early 70s, becoming a recluse of sorts in self-imposed exile from Nixon’s America as he worked on a number of projects. It is out of this unique context that 13 was able to become the perfect musical example of early 70s drugged-out paranoia and disillusionment with the prior decade’s idealism.
13 is R&B instead of Hazlewood’s usual styles because before he went to Sweden, he hired musician Larry Marks to produce a contemporary R&B funk based style for LHI. Originally recorded as a Marks album in 1970, 13 got shelved due to LHI’s financial straits and lack of distribution. When Hazlewood left for Sweden, soon after working with Marks on the album, he took the unreleased 13’s tapes. In 1972, Hazlewood released a new version of 13, with his vocals replacing Marks’.
13, though it did not start out a Hazlewood album, still has much of the artist’s usual traits on the album. From the era and cover art alone, one can nearly tell that 13 is a masterpiece of early 70s burst-bubble hippiedom, a place for the idealism of flower power to choke on the polluted haze of "stonery" non-conformist angst and paranoia. The cover art shows the center of a dart board with Hazlewood’s head right under it, surrounded in the background by darts, presumably thrown daringly around his cranium. Besides immediate humor, such an absurd photograph is likely a joke that Hazlewood is hardly in the same category of fame or influence as the assassinated political leaders of the era like Martin Luther King Jr and President John F. Kennedy or of then recently deceased rockers like Jimmy Hendrix who were also thought to possibly have been killed by “The Man.” Furthering the paranoid interpretation of the album cover is Hazlewood’s change in appearance from his typically fancily dressed, shorthaired, and mustachioed look to a hippie look wearing a plain navy blue sweater with long hair and no mustache. The number 13 that gives the album its title also lends it weight toward such an interpretation of tongue-in-cheek paranoia as Jesus had 12 apostles making him the '13th' person, ripe to be crucified.
Hazlewood was nothing if not a tasteful user of kitsch. Although funk was revered by critics in 1972, there were plenty of cash-in attempts in the genre, as session musicians were hired to compile libraries of ready-made funky music for soundtracks to films and commercials. It is this contemporary kitsch-funk that one is reminded when hearing the opening of 13 as the lead track “You Look Like a Lady” kicks off with propulsive horns and a heavily funky rhythm section. Such musical elements may seem a bit dated since much pop music of that era was similar due to crossover influence of black music and the massive success of horn-driven bands like Chicago. However, pop artists would not have tried to emulate this sound were it not a pretty groovy sound that required high levels of musical ability. Still, one hardly expects to hear a voice like Hazlewood’s, suited to his own folk-country, to come out of such a heavy funk.
“You Look Like a Lady,” also displays Hazlewood’s classic sense of humor and the non-conformist "stonery" ethos of the album. For one thing, the idea of a person looking like a lady, but not necessarily being one has been used for comedic reasons, but also speaks to non-conformist identities like transgenderism and homosexuality, much like Lou Reed’s classic hit from the same year, “Walk on the Wild Side.” In addition to shattering taboos surrounding sexuality, “You Look Like a Lady,” quickly establishes the album’s breaking of the taboo of drug references, the opening lines of the song and album being: “My head is bad / My mind is through / Ain’t been so stoned / Since I was new.” The song is about a drifter and one gets a sense of both the urgency of his movement and the deeper longing that he experiences.
The chill of the next song “Tulsa Sunday,” sets a pattern on the album of alternation between fast and slow tempo tunes. The song is slow funk, filled with building fuzz and guitar in addition to the floating and falling horns that traipse along to complement Hazlewood’s slow, almost drunken vocal. The song's instrumental aspect alone might be enough to qualify it as drug referential, even without all its lyrical assertions. In “Tulsa Sunday,” Hazlewood serenades a mysterious “Priscilla,” who may or may not be the person who “looks like a lady,” or, for that matter, may or may not be Elvis’ wife. He asks her to “Take a look at that sun, Priscilla, / don’t it make you want to fly? / take a look at that sky, Priscilla, / don’t it make you want to get high?” While it might be perfectly reasonable to dismiss these as banal stereotypical stoner lyrics that lack any substance, keep in mind that was kind of the point in the first place as Hazlewood puts his own perverse spin on the hippie drug culture through what are often intentionally exaggerated and stereotypical tropes.
Following the languor of “Tulsa Sunday,” is the upbeat “Ten or 11 Towns Ago,” which contains the line that may be most indicative of the album’s hippie nonsense ethos: “One week in San Francisco / Existing on Nabisco / cookies and bad dreams / sad scenes and dodging paranoia.” The line recalls San Francisco as the home of hippiedom, but beyond that, seems to be evocative of lines from the song “Truckin’” by that scene’s premier band, Grateful Dead: “Livin’ on reds, Vitamin C, and cocaine / all they can say is ain’t it a shame?” Whether Hazlewood is lampooning such cultural references or trying to make his own stab at them is up to each listener to guess, but this does not seem to be a song that takes itself too seriously.
​On what many describe as Hazlewood’s “soul album,” the track that is most discernibly soul is “And I Loved You Then.” It is heavily reminiscent of Isaac Hayes and fits the album’s narrative of a character that for all his movement is stuck in the same place. One does not generally think of Hazlewood as soul balladeer, but this is his stab at it and he sings on his own terms.
​*13* ends on the funky “Hej, Me I’m Riding,” pronounced “hey.” The misspelling is once again that anti-grammar ideals of hippiedom rearing its head. It explains the background of the drifting speaker as someone whose brother died and father left, which is a timeless blues trope. Despite this, the narrator has managed to make a life for himself, his “riding,” being that he is on the ride of life. It is a summary of the album’s speaker’s situation, somebody with no real home, who is kind of just drifting along. In a sense, one might say that it was also a summary of Hazlewood’s situation at the time as he felt there was not much for him back home in the U.S, while Sweden could never really be his home.
​*13*, though not necessarily representative of his broader work, is still an essential Hazlewood album. Even though this is such a drastic production departure from his more typical symphonic orchestrations, he was known for quirky production, so this is not too unfamiliar. Are you going to hear a great soul singer? No, but you are going to hear a highly unique singer on a great psychedelic pop and soul album filled with hazy 70s morose.

Something that makes Pittsburgh so unique is its interdisciplinary culture, with the sciences, the arts, and technology all in one place. From all the public art installations throughout the city to the self driving cars that roam the streets, these are the kinds of things that really define Pittsburgh. But the most fascinating sights are the ones that combine the very different fields of science, art, and technology. A great example of that is a current art exhibit being displayed here on campus, titled Hacking/Modding/Remixing as Feminist Protest. This exhibit, presented at The Miller Gallery in The Purnell Center for Arts, will be showing until Feb. 26 and has been organized by Angela Washko, a visiting Assistant Professor in the art department of the College of Fine Arts. 
Hacking/Modding/Remixing features mixed media works of various artists that communicate themes and issues raised by the feminist movement. The exhibit itself takes up about three floors in the gallery, with each floor representing one of three different takes on technological art: hacking, modding, and remixing. The first floor essentially provides a preview for the themes and artwork seen later in the exhibit. It features a little pink setup for visitors to play video games at the side of the entrance and a room showing various videos that speak to the topics of equal rights and gender roles, specifically using clips from popular films and TV shows. 
The pieces on the second floor exhibited the hacking/modding aspect, where all the works focused on the concept of coding, and how it can be used as a tool for transforming the functions of common devices. For example, one of the pieces on the second floor was a short “mobile poem,” titled "Dear Sirs", that was presented on a Nintendo DS. The main idea was to have the viewer physically interact with the text, and hopefully find a hidden message within the poem. Many of the other pieces on the floor were similar, where gaming systems were incorporated to both make the art more interactive and allow guests to think about how the digital world can influence people’s behavior. 
The third floor was centered around the technique of remixing, where the artists utilized existing songs, videos and pictures to communicate messages about politics, women’s rights, and the female body. All the graphics and various forms of media being displayed throughout this floor definitely made all the pieces very eye-catching. All three floors of Hacking/Modding/Remixing as Feminist Protest had a lot of information to share and powerful themes to express with visitors, but the exhibit didn’t just end there. On Friday February 10th, there was a special extended event to the exhibit at The Andy Warhol Museum. The event included a presentation of multiple abstract videos, all focused on the same topics addressed in The Miller Gallery exhibit. There was a live performance by video and performance artist, Ann Hirsch, in which she taught the audience "How to Get on Reality TV", and referred to her own experiences, having been on VH1’s reality TV show Frank the Entertainer...In a Basement Affair. All the content in this event addressed the many issues associated with women’s rights, sexuality, and how they are viewed in society. The videos explicitly presented the major influence social media has on the portrayal of women in popular culture today, and without a doubt helped the audience see all these effects from the perspectives of the female artists featured in the event.
The entire Hacking/Modding/Remixing as Feminist Protest exhibit really makes its guests think. Guests can learn more about the hidden meanings behind various forms of entertainment, and how they contribute to shaping gender roles in society. It can also allow guests to open their eyes to new perspectives, and even emotionally experience issues regarding discrimination and violations of equal rights, that so many people have dealt with, and continue to deal with today. It’s a sight that is truly inspiring and certainly worth visiting. 
The artists featured in The Miller Gallery exhibit were Addie Wagenknecht (Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry Fellow 2014), Anne-Marie Schleiner, Annina Rüst, Cat Mazza (CMU Alumna, SoArt 1999), Channel Two, Dara Birnbaum (CMU Alumna, SoArch 1969), Elisa Kreisinger, Kathy High, Lynn Hershman Leeson, Mary Flanagan, micha cárdenas, Morehshin Allahyari, Myfanwy Ashmore, Olia Lialina, Rachel Rampleman, Rachel Simone Weil, RAFiA Santana, Skawennati, Soda Jerk and VNS Matrix, Sondra Perry, and Suzie Silver (CMU Professor of Art).

You fight dirty
You shoot your eyes like daggers at mine
On the phone, and when we fuck
A thousand times to push your luck
Show me who you are
Don’t tell me what you want
Its easy to fall and easier to stand
When you’re my only helping hand
Am I just lost?
Or did I find something special here
You lead me straight into the light
Even though it leaves me blind
My lungs fill with emptiness
In this twisted galaxy wrapped around your finger
I forget who I am every day
And I let you remake me from clay
From where we stand
I see the city lights down below
Other things seem small when I’m with you
I don’t want to fall - I’ll never let you go
You lob your bombs and fire your guns
I’ll catch them all till you’re done
Memories are made and lost in a day
When there are so many coming my way

Every time I've walked into a movie theatre in the past three months, I've been reminded at least once that LEGO Batman would be coming out in mid-February, suspiciously near the holiday filled with love, public displays of affection, overpriced heart-shaped chocolate boxes, and, for some, the stinging sensation telling them that they are still single and that's not okay. Thankfully, the movie trailer did not once mention the fact that V-day is approaching. It seemed to be a perfectly innocent movie about a superhero learning to team up with ordinary people to fight bad guys, plus a few superhero jokes that only teenagers could truly appreciate. So I went, only expecting to be entertained. 
I was, undoubtedly, entertained by the flashing colors and deafening sound coming from the impressive sound system of the IMAX theatre. I was slightly disappointed when I found that constructing different objects using LEGO blocks — a prominent theme in the first LEGO movie — was only used as a creative form of presenting the Batman story, but I should have seen it coming. After all, this is LEGO Batman, where "LEGO" is only the adjective, nothing more. There are only a few references to building weapons and automobiles scattered throughout the movie. This movie is basically a Batman movie stripped of all seriousness and smoothness, accompanied by Batman's brutally honest statements about his socially unacceptable true nature.
Just like any other superhero movie, Batman, again, saves the entire city of Gotham and everyone's a** five minutes into the movie by defusing Joker's bomb, which was intended to blow up the entire world. After singlehandedly defeating an entire army of villains, Batman returns to the Batcave in a swarm of praise and awe, with a news reporter's voice echoing, "It must be great to be Batman — I can only imagine he's going home now to party the night away, surrounded by friends and lady activewear models!" 
The music slowed, and the lights dimmed. I was now watching Batman returning after one (short) day of victory to his home inhabited by two and half people: his butler Alfred, Batman himself, and his computer. The enormous, high-tech, lavish residence on an isolated island seemed to provide Batman with nothing more than boredom and loneliness. Just like any tired employer who returns to their empty apartment at the end of the day, Batman walks into his home, warms up food left in the fridge by Alfred, sits in front of his television, and starts watching a romantic comedy.  This is the recurring theme throughout the entire movie. It starts with Batman being lonely in his cave, then extends to him staring sentimentally at his family photo, defensively answering Alfred's question about his greatest fear, and clumsily teaching his adopted teenager to behave. 
We get it: Batman has emotions, and he is simply a vulnerable, normal human being under his shell.
But the movie went even further. After telling Joker how unimportant he is and consequently breaking his heart, Batman reveals his ultimate vulnerability. Without someone who he can passionately hate and chase after, he is bored and disoriented. Always working and claiming victories alone, Batman suddenly can no longer fight crimes without the presence of a team or a family. While it is not a crime to use these cheesy coincidences to make a point, nor does anyone really care about the plot consistency of a "kids' movie," I do find some aspects of the movie unsettling, especially the one emphasizing the importance of having the one to make you happy or successful. Somehow singlehandedly fighting villains and wanting to celebrate victory by spending time alone is less okay and satisfactory than sharing it with loved ones; somehow one cannot live to the fullest without the one that they love (or, in this case, hate) full-heartedly. This is proven by the ending scene where Batman lets a team of villains, including the Joker, walk away in the face of the police after expending tremendous efforts to hunt them down. Under the lighthearted and somewhat cynical humor lies the constant reminder that being alone is really not okay.
Someone who thinks they care about you and understand you will come knocking on your door, asking you whether you are okay; and even if you are perfectly okay at the beginning, you feel less okay after you hear their questions. Next thing you know, you are already questioning yourself. "Why did they ask me if I was okay?" "There must be something wrong with me." No. There's nothing wrong with you, or being alone. There are two types of LEGO movie fans: the people who like LEGO Batman — a romantic comedy masked in a superhero costume shaped like a patchwork of cubes — and the people who like the first LEGO movie, because we understand that not "everything is great when you are part of a team." While you're sympathizing with the new LEGO Batman movie, don't forget that some of us are born to be superheroes and need no mask of disguise. We can feel happiness by being alone, in fact, just as much as by having that special one to rely on.

Dear Shanley and Rachel,
Hello. So The CIT Ball is coming up this week, and I’m super pumped to go. So the thing is, I know that the guy usually asks the girl… But I was so excited about the ball that I thought that maybe I should be the one to ask a guy. In a panic with only a week until the ball, I decided to ask one of my close guy friends. I guess I may have made TOO big of a deal about it, because I went all out on asking him. I went to the store and bought several balloons. Then I contacted his roommate so I could put them all in there to surprise him. I had never asked anyone to a dance before, so I thought that I should make it magical. Well I guess I made it TOO magical. Because he came back to his dorm and freaked out. And when I mean freaked out, I mean he yelled at me saying, “Who are you? Why are you in my room? Get out!” I guess we weren’t as close friends as I thought. I am now really embarrassed. I want to go to the ball with a guy, but I guess I’m lost on how to ask someone now. Do you have any recommendations on how I should ask in the future?
Sincerely,
Dates Are Tough, Even Laid-back Events Seriously Suck
Hello DATELESS,
I am so sorry that asking your guy out didn’t work. But don’t let that get you down! Being awkward isn’t easy, and trust me, I’ve been in that awkward stage before. I recommend that maybe you should ask more casually, especially if you’re asking a friend. Besides, if you go with one of your guy friends then you guys can just have a good time with no pressure. Maybe next time go to one of your friends and just be like, “hey I heard the CIT ball is coming up next week, and I was wondering if you think it’d be chill if we went together.” That way it is very casual so even if you do get rejected it’s not that big of a deal. Maybe before you ask, you could ask one of his friends if you think he would go with you. But even if another guy says no, don’t take it personally! There are plenty fish in the Carnegie sea.
From yours truly,
Shanley and Rachel
Dear Ruth, 
The other night, I went on a date with a cute boy and we had a great time over dinner and drinks. We went back over to my place, one thing led to another, and well... you know how it goes. The next morning, however, I was in a pickle because as someone not on birth control, I had to quickly run to my nearby CVS and purchase Plan B. Did you know Plan B is $50?! That’s ridiculous. Anyway, I let the boy know about that situation. However, I lowkey think he should help me out paying for the Plan B. I mean, we both decided unprotected sex was a risk worth taking, and it does take two to make a baby. Should I ask him to split halvsies with me on the Plan B pill?
Sincerely,
Pay a Little And No Babies
Hello PLAN B,
Our society and the medical community like to put the vast majority of birth control responsibility on women. The only male-specific form that’s even commercially available right now is condoms, and I’ll be honest, I know a lot of women who keep their own supply just in case. This is, I think, totally B.S. Just because one party faces a lot more risk if conception actually happens doesn’t mean everyone involved shouldn’t take equal responsibility. So yes, you should absolutely ask him to go halvsies on your Plan B; and if he complains, remind him that it’s way less expensive than going halvsies on raising a child. (Also, pro-tip: generic is only $30.)
Get some safely,
Ruth

Zeke and I originally planned to start off this column with an exciting bar in an exciting neighborhood. But when Zeke was an hour late (although he insists he was only 49 minutes late) and we had no mixers but cinnamon-apple tea and the world was an icy wasteland of frozen dreams, we decided to walk down the street to Squirrel Hill Cafe. 
The location: Outside of Oakland, which is dominated by Pitt students (oh the horror), Squirrel Hill Cafe might be the most accessible bar from campus. Just hop on any 61 bus and you'll end up right across the street from its friendly red neon sign. In one of the safest (read: overrun by children) neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, this bar is where the locals kick back with their buddies after a long day at work. Be warned, though, Squirrel Hill Cafe is pretty much the only bar in the neighborhood (exception: that one sports bar, which Zeke will never drag me to). Find a good table and expect this to be your home base for the night.
The drinks: Sit down for five minutes and a waiter will actually come to you. This isn't the place to order anything fancy, but they're good on your basics. Since I never drink beer unless it's free from a keg, I ordered a whisky sour and Zeke ordered a gin and tonic. It's hard to mess up a gin and tonic, and I'm relieved to say they didn't. The main thing the cocktail menu has going for it is the price. I was shocked when the bill came out to about $3.50 a drink. Hard to ask for a better deal, especially if you're talking to a couple New Yorkers. The last time we went drinking, over break in Manhattan, we accidentally purchased Long Island ice teas for $17 a pop. Needless to say, this was a better night for us. 
The vibe: You probably won't make any new friends here, and if you're prowling for booty you might want to look elsewhere. But for a casual night with friends Squirrel Hill Cafe is ideal. Noise level is minimal and music is unobtrusive. Bigger groups can grab one of a few tables, while we got our pick of cozy little booths. They're built for two people who'd actually like to talk to each other, but might also be appropriate for anyone who'd rather sip at their Jameson neat and contemplate loneliness. We had ample opportunity to talk our way ever closer and tipsier toward the topic of our impending futures, a favorite hobby of all graduating seniors.
Lit or nah: Nah, but that's sort of this bar's appeal. If you can accept smelling like an ashtray until your next shower, Squirrel Hill Cafe is the perfect bar for cheap drinks and easy conversation with some good company. 
On the other hand, Zeke did want to mention that $3 drinks are exceptionally lit.
They've also got food, but only until midnight. So after last call, we headed over to the only place open in Squirrel Hill at two in the morning: Eat n' Park. Nothing beats a heaping plate of mediocre diner fries at an hour any normal person should be sleeping. Or a full serving of straight cottage cheese, if you're the same brand of weirdo as Zeke.

On Feb. 9, Mike Doyle, the U.S. representative for Pennsylvania’s 14th congressional district, spoke to a packed crowd in Margaret Morrison Hall. Doyle used this platform to discuss how he and other Democratic representatives planned on fighting President Donald Trump with regards to issues most important to them today.
Doyle began his speech by discussing healthcare, a hot topic over which Republicans and Democrats have butted heads for many years, ever since the passing of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. The reason that it is such a topic of debate now is due to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often shortened to ACA and nicknamed Obamacare. Instituted in 2010, in the midst of Obama’s Democratic presidency, the ACA made healthcare available to people who were previously unable to afford healthcare. This was heavily contested by Republicans. Doyle said that he and many other Democrats did not initially support the ACA, preferring instead to strengthen the preexisting Medicare and Medicaid systems.
This reaction to ACA shows that attempts at bipartisanship were denied by the Republicans ever since Obama took office. This time around, with a Republican president, Doyle warned that if the Republican representatives wanted help they shouldn’t expect any, saying that “if [Republicans] want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, [they] own it. Good luck.”
Doyle then spoke about some of the steps citizens could take to fight the current administration, if they believed in that cause. One of the most important roles that he stressed was developing what he called a “farm team,” a group of passionate individuals willing to work hard to run for elected positions in their local government. Doyle joked, “you don’t start your political career as a U.S. Senator.” He emphasized how valuable it was to have a group of supporters that were willing to work at the lower levels if they were going to rebuild their political party.
Something else that Doyle insisted would be beneficial for the Democratic party was to re-elect Tom Wolf, the current Pennsylvania governor. In a state government that is currently dominated by the Republican party, having a democrat in a position of power will help increase the influence of the Democratic party. However, throughout his talk, he remained insistent that his party should not lose sight of its ideals and become overly radicalized, stating “let’s not be the Democratic version of the Tea Party.”
Doyle also talked about an issue that he felt was inhibiting the Democratic party’s ability to influence politics in modern America: gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is the rearrangement of district lines in order to change the outcome of election results. Doyle felt that Republicans had rearranged the district lines in Pennsylvania so that the substantial Democratic population around the Pittsburgh area was isolated mainly into one district.
After his speech, Doyle opened the lecture hall to the audience for a question and answer session. Among the topics of concern was immigration, specifically the recently publicized case of Martin Esquivel-Hernandez who was deported to Mexico. Doyle said that he and others of a similar mindset passionately fought against the decision, as he felt that Esquivel-Hernandez might have been racially profiled by the officers responsible for his arrest.
Doyle spoke about the issues that face the Democrats in the House of Representatives, the primary one being that they don’t control the floor, and therefore can’t propose more bills. In this case, Doyle explained, the best that can be done is ensuring that the hard work of the past couple years wouldn’t be erased. “I am not turning the clock back to the 50s, and I am not turning my back on my principles,” Doyle said.
He left the lecture hall with a critique of President Trump. As one might imagine, the Democratic representative was not pleased with him. In particular, President Trump’s attitude towards the First Amendment bothered him, causing him to claim that “Donald Trump has attacked free press in this country… that’s the beginning of the end.” He feels that Trump is trying to destroy our trust in the media, which is unacceptable to Doyle. However, he left the hall on a hopeful note, “I believe there are Republicans that are going to stand up.” He believes the American people will resist the antics of our current president and prevent him from doing anything too harmful.
Congressman Doyle’s talk is the first installment in Carnegie Mellon College Democrat’s Trump Resistance Series. All semester long, activists, civil leaders, and others will discuss how Democrats can stand against President Trump’s agenda.

Multiple research universities in Pennsylvania have decided to help federally funded research turn into more job options and business opportunities for the state by using the Pennsylvania I-Corps Network. This I-Corps group includes Carnegie Mellon University, Drexel University, the University of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania State University, Lehigh University, and the University of Pittsburgh.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) founded I-Corps in 2011. I-Corps’ goal is to finance engineers and scientists while they work outside of the laboratory to allow certain NSF projects to cause a greater effect on people. The National Institute of Health and the Department of Energy have begun using this program, and the Science Federation of Ireland has also taken to the I-Corps initiative.
“The NSF I-Corps program is having a transformative impact on innovation by creating new pathways from discovery to commercialization,” John Holdren, who served as President Obama’s science advisor and director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in a university press release. “The [Pennsylvania] I-Corps Network will help energize more faculty to explore the potential of transforming their research into powerful ideas.”
The American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA) reflected overwhelming bipartisan support for the growth of the I-Corps program. It stated that I-Corps has a good track record for executing its goals, and federal agencies should take note and enact I-Corps practices. AICA also granted the NSF director permission to initiate both local and state relationships that resemble the work being done in Pennsylvania.
“NSF investments in fundamental research underlie technologies such as the Internet, 3D printers, GPS, and solar cells,” NSF Director France A. Córdova said. “The I-Corps program, which first started at NSF, is accelerating the transformation of ideas into commercial products and companies by training researchers how to bring their discoveries into the marketplace.”
A group put together by the universities involved in this plan has started looking into how a Pennsylvania I-Corps Network would help improve the corroboration of the best and most effective procedures on coaching, counseling, and encouragement activities for people who want to be entrepreneurs. This collection of people is also looking into ways to include other higher education places in Pennsylvania in the I-Corps program and how the I-Corps principles and teachings can help startups backed by the Ben Franklin Technology Partners. The Ben Franklin Technology Partners is financially supported by the state of Pennsylvania and is a renowned economic development organization that supports new firms and established manufacturers through monetary investments, experience in the field, and collegiate assets.
“Within a span of only five years, the NSF Innovation Corps program has established a new model for catalyzing and fostering an innovation ecosystem that is firmly grounded in fundamental scientific research. I am delighted that the U.S. Congress and other federal agencies have strongly endorsed and embraced this program,” President Subra Suresh said. President Suresh led the creation of I-Corps as Director of the National Science Foundation.
Carnegie Mellon’s I-Corps Site program has included 203 people from Fall 2014 to Spring 2016.
“I am also pleased that Carnegie Mellon University, along with our sister institutions in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, have decided to explore stronger collaboration on statewide I-Corps activities,” Suresh said.

On Friday, Jan. 27, President Trump signed an executive order halting the U.S. refugee resettlement program for 120 days, putting an end to the resettling of Syrian refugees in the U.S. indefinitely, and banning citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries in the Middle East and North Africa (Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen) from entering the United States.
A federal judge temporarily stopped enforcement of much of the controversial counter-terrorism executive action on Friday, Feb. 3. Judge James Robart instructed the government to no longer ban individuals from the seven countries from entering the U.S., and the refugee bans were undone as well. Even the section of the executive order that instructed the government to give preference to religious minorities when selecting refugees was halted by the restraining order. This is a temporary measure that will remain in place until the court system makes a more definite ruling. 
Several high-ranking Carnegie Mellon University officials reacted to the executive order via emails to the campus community. President Subra Suresh wrote about how his personal experiences as an immigrant lead him to support Carnegie Mellon’s international students through university policies. “We will do all that is within our power, as individuals, as an institution, and by working through national organizations such as the Association of American Universities and with federal, state and local officials, to support our international students and scholars to the fullest extent possible,” President Suresh wrote. Carnegie Mellon’s president also promised to create a community forum and support group to discuss issues relevant to immigration and international students at Carnegie Mellon.
Provost Farnam Jahanian and Dean of Students Gina Casalegno also wrote a letter to the Carnegie Mellon community, pledging that the university will offer support and assistance to international students who are affected by changes in the immigration policy. Helen Wang, the Director of Residential Education, emailed students promising that Carnegie Mellon will continue to be an inclusive and accepting home. “No matter where you hail, what your beliefs, where your frustrations/anger/fear/hurt comes from, you have a place and a home with us,” Wang wrote. 
The Office of International Education has been posting regular updates on its news page, which includes the recommendation that citizens of the seven countries included in the executive order should not travel outside of the U.S. due to the “ongoing legal uncertainties.”
To get a better understanding of the policy changes, The Tartan spoke with Brian Kovak, Assistant Professor of Economics and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College, who researches and teaches courses on immigration policy. 
Professor Kovak noted that “there’s quite a bit of historical precedent for presidents using executive actions to either strengthen or defer immigration policy enforcement.” President Jimmy Carter temporarily restricted certain types of travel from Iran to the U.S. during the hostage crisis of 1979-1981, and President Obama used executive power to more thoroughly vet Iraqi immigrants and refugees, but Kovak claimed that Trump’s executive order is “certainly unprecedented in the modern era in terms of its scope.” 
So why were these seven countries selected for the ban? It appears that the countries were taken from a 2015 list put together by Congressional Republicans and the Obama administration’s Department of Homeland Security. Since 2015, citizens of the countries on the list have been required to obtain a visa to enter the U.S., even if they also have a passport from a country like Britain or Japan.
Would these immigration and refugee restrictions make the U.S. more or less safe? Kovak thinks that “on balance, it’ll have a minimal effect.” Kovak pointed out that “No one from the seven countries listed has been arrested on terrorism charges in the years since 9/11. No one from those countries was involved in the 9/11 attacks.” Further, Kovak believes that the existing vetting procedures for refugees and immigrants are “quite extensive”, so an outright ban would not significantly reduce risk.
Jonathan Caulkins, a Heinz College professor who studies counter-terrorism policy, also believes that the executive order would “not make a huge difference either way.” Caulkins dismissed concerns that the policy would offend the Iraqi government, the United States’ ally in the fight against ISIS, saying that most Iraqis probably already have their mind made up one way or the other about the United States, and this policy wouldn’t do much to change that. Kovak disagreed, saying that the immigration ban “may generate a breakdown of international relations between our government and the governments of allied countries, such as that in Iraq” which could reduce cooperation and “make us substantially less safe.”
As for the prediction made by Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) that the executive order would facilitate terrorist recruitment, Caulkins and Kovak are both doubtful that the policy will have a large effect on ISIS’ ability to gain followers.
If you are passionate about immigration policy and would like to voice your opinion, Kovak recommends the following for students who are eligible to vote: Register to vote in advance of the 2018 midterm elections and call your representatives in Congress. For students registered to vote on campus, contact Senator Robert Casey (D-PA), Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA), and Congressman Mike Doyle (D-PA). Make sure to list your name and address of your voter registration so that the politician knows that you are his/her constituent.
For international students who might be personally affected by changes in immigration policy, Kovak encourages you to share your story on social media and/or contact a reporter about your experiences.

Professor Andrzej Strojwas, Carnegie Mellon’s Joseph F. and Nancy Keithley Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, has been awarded the 2016 Phil Kaufman Award for Distinguished Contributions to Electronic System Design (EDA). The EDA award was established by the Electronic System Design Alliance to honor significant contributions to the area of electronic design.
Strojwas, an immigrant from Poland and a Carnegie Mellon graduate, received the award for “his pioneering research in the area of design for manufacturing in the semiconductor industry,” according to a university press release. He has been chief technologist of PDF Solutions since 1997 and has served in a variety of other companies, including AT&T Bell Laboratories and Texas Instruments. He has also received many other awards for his publications and was elected IEEE Fellow in 1990.
Much of the significance of his work centers around the design of semiconductor chips, allowing their manufacturing in fabrication labs (also known as fabs) to be more efficient and less costly. He played a key role in integrating the design and manufacturing of chips, processes which were previously mostly separate. Many modern chip designs are based heavily on research work Strojwas and his group have done.
“When we started our research, design and manufacturing were two disjoint areas and very limited information was exchanged between the chip designers and Integrated Circuit (IC) fabrication engineers,” Strojwas said in an interview with The Tartan.
He and some colleagues realized that, besides controlling fab contamination and defects, design issues also contributed to the semiconductor yield. Thus, it was possible to systematically model the semiconductor yield and test the results. His research also yielded information about methods of testing wafers that saved time and money. These processes have become widely adopted by the semiconductor industry.
Initially, the statistical testing processes developed by Strojwas were such a radical departure from the original chip design processes that it took several years for the industry to adopt them, mainly after it started becoming constrained by the ever-shrinking size of chips designed. “As the miniaturization and the rapid increase in the chip complexity progressed, they forced the industry to change and that’s how the Design for Manufacturing had become the necessity,” Strojwas said.
He says that the biggest modern challenge to this field is developing even newer technology for chip design amidst the demands for more miniaturization and more computing power. The smaller the size of the chips, the more difficult and complex the manufacturing process gets. At these kinds of scales, it is difficult to detect and fix any problems that might occur during the manufacturing process.
“You really have to make sure you’re performing close to what you promised your designers,” which is the biggest modern difficulty in this field due to the current limits of the small-sized technology, Strojwas said. At length scales smaller than 20 nanometers, the transistors only get more challenging to manufacture in a cost-effective way.
Something memorable that happened during his research career was when three of his Ph.D. graduate students decided to start the company called PDF Solutions, which Strojwas himself is still involved in. The company has grown rapidly since its founding and today employs about 450 people. It works in a variety of areas, including engineering consulting and working with fabless companies to streamline the process for new technologies to be introduced to the market.
“The environment at PDF has been amazing and I am extremely fortunate that these guys still want me to be involved,” Strojwas said.

For the 21 and over crowd, getting a drink at a bar on Friday or Saturday nights tends to be the norm to unwind after a long week. What first starts out as an effort to relax can quickly turn bothersome while dealing with long lines at crowded bars. To combat this problem, a group of Carnegie Mellon students have recently launched a mobile ordering app called Refill which will allow users to skip this process and easily order and pay for drinks on their phones.
The app was first conceived after Ian Glasner, a 2016 graduate of Tepper Business School and Carnegie Institute of Technology, and a friend were excited to catch up over a few drinks at a bar in San Francisco. After waiting over 15 minutes to place their orders, they found themselves getting frustrated and chose to leave. The pair decided not to let go of this experience but rather work to prevent it from happening to countless other people. After spending hours discussing this issue, they realized that, with the help of a few other Carnegie Mellon students skilled in design and engineering, they could develop an app to help avoid it.
Refill allows customers to search through the various choices on the bar’s menu to conveniently order drinks on their phone. The user is able to see a timeline of when their order is being prepared (including who is making the order) to when it is ready. Each order has its own code which makes it easy to retrieve. According to Glasner, this simple process means that “there’s no wait, no line, and no shouting above the din of the bar to get an order across. The entire experience takes place in the app.”
Due to the efficiency of using an app to place orders, larger companies have also come out with a similar product. Starbucks, for example, has a similar app which allows customers to order their drinks and food ahead of time. Refill’s goal, however, is to provide smaller coffee shops and bars with the same resources used by big corporations like Starbucks or McDonalds. “We want to give small companies that don’t have the technological or financial resources the same opportunities to target their customers,” Glasner said.
Refill first found its roots at William Penn Tavern, a small but popular bar that many Carnegie Mellon students frequently attend. After having pitched the idea of the app over a year ago, the owner of William Penn Tavern acknowledged its potential and decided to get on board.
William Penn Tavern housed Refill’s official launch party on Thursday, Feb. 9. The bar was packed with students all having a good time while trying out the app for the first time. By the end of the night, over 60 orders were placed, adding up to around $400.
Since the app started its development in Pittsburgh, the fact that it was launched in the area is special to the team. “Pittsburgh is the heart of it all, and we can’t wait for Refill to start influencing the way the city enjoys its bars and coffee shops,” Glasner said.
Glasner believes that over time, it is likely that ordering food and drinks will eventually go mobile. “It’ll be about who does it properly first.”
The company is now seeking to expand the reach of the app to other locations. Those interested can download the app at userefill.com and try it out for themselves.

Artificial intelligence experts propose new regulations to be used on driverless cars
Two artificial intelligence experts argue that current safety regulations for driverless cars are ill-equipped to ensure that these vehicles will perform in a safe and reliable manner. Their solution is to have regulations be performed for these vehicles in phases similar to the drug approval process. 
David Danks, the L.L. Thurstone Professor of Philosophy and Psychology and head of the Department of Philosophy, and Alex John London, professor of philosophy and director of the Center for Ethics and Policy in Dietrich College, published their opinions in an article for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' Intelligent Systems. 
"Self-driving cars and autonomous systems are rapidly spreading through every part of society, but their successful use depends on whether we can trust and understand them," Danks said in a university press release. "We, as a society, need to find new ways to monitor and guide the development and implementation of these autonomous systems."
In order to understand how the vehicles will act in various situations, Danks and London propose that this regulatory process begin with testing the vehicle in simulated environments with different landscapes and climates. If successful, the system will be able to move on to being tested in real-world environments with a trained human driver. As performance goals are continuously met, the vehicles will not have as many restrictions. 
"Autonomous vehicles have the potential to save lives and increase economic productivity. But these benefits won't be realized unless the public has credible assurance that such systems are safe and reliable," London said in the press release.
Experts argue that terrorism research should not be driven by political agendas
In an article published in Science Policy Forum, four experts from different fields propose that terrorism research should be theoretically informed and inclusive to all disciplines in line with policy-making. This proposal seeks to protect the academic research from political interference and protect policymakers from having simplistic academic accounts.
This strategy, proposed in an article titled "Challenges in Researching Terrorism From the Field," was written by Carnegie Mellon's own Baruch Fischhoff, a decision scientist, Scott Atran, an anthropologist at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris, Robert Axelrod, a political scientist from the University of Michigan, and Richard Davis, a former White House policy adviser now at the University of Oxford. The authors believe that terrorism research would benefit from a national institutional review board which would ensure the ethical standing of the work and that science, not politics, guided its funding.
"Bridging theory and practice is always challenging, and particularly when diverse forms of expertise are needed, and the people who have it lack opportunities, and perhaps incentives, for collaboration," Fischhoff, the Howard Heinz University Professor in CMU’s Institute for Politics and Strategy and Department of Engineering and Public Policy, said in a university press release. "Research that overcomes these barriers is a hallmark of Carnegie Mellon and of the projects featured in our article. It is essential if the social sciences are to make their essential contributions to the fundamentally human problems that terrorism reflects and represents."

Students with non-western sounding Asian names were targeted last week at Columbia University as vandals ripped the name tags off their doors. This happened in the wake of the Lunar New Year, a celebration welcoming the new year for the East Asian community. While the act itself might seem small, it’s enough to send a message of exclusion to the students targeted —one that has been echoed by President Donald Trump not only in current legislation, but in his campaign rhetoric.
It’s no secret that since Trump became a prominent figure in the political arena, people have become more emboldened in their beliefs. He’s given people that are self proclaimed “not-racists” the comfort of knowing that they’re not alone in wanting the country to go back to a time of little diversity. While the idea of “I’m not racist, but” has always been a prominent one in this country, he put that idea back into the White House and introduced legislation that’s not “meant to be racist,” but conveniently only targets certain groups of people.
Even small acts of prejudice make a loud statement in a time where Trump has set a precedent for a president to exclude immigrants based on religion. In this case, while it may seem silly to target something as trivial as a door tag, it’s just loud enough to send a message of exclusion. Racism isn’t as prominent as calling someone a derogatory term to their face anymore. It’s silent, but the silent acts of racism are the ones that seem the loudest. These are the things that don’t necessarily give the racist act a name and a face, but create a presence of racism which is arguably more intimidating than having someone outright say insulting things. It creates an environment in which racism is something that a lot of people are thinking, but no one wants to admit to, which doesn’t make it any more acceptable. In fact, it’s almost more frightening to know that Americans still have these secret, racist thoughts that surface through acts like this.
Xenophobia is almost as deeply rooted in this country as immigration is. However, despite what Trump would want us to believe, it’s not okay to belittle and erase people because you don’t want them in “your country.” Whether the students targeted at Columbia were from America or not, that doesn’t change the fact that they are people and deserve to be respected as such. Acts like these also create a divide between Asian and Asian-American students by showing that as long as you appear western you’re safe from scrutiny.
The fact that these vandals targeted only non-western sounding names also brings up ideas of how it is acceptable to have a heritage outside of the “American culture” as long as you assimilate to “American culture.” The idea that it’s okay to not be from America as long as, once you get here, you walk, talk, and act “American” is deeply flawed. There is no right or wrong way to be an American. We’ve always been called a melting pot of different cultures and ethnicities. You shouldn’t have to erase your own culture to be considered an American. Just because someone holds onto the culture and heritage of another country does not make them disqualified from being granted the same liberties that are supposed to be granted to American citizens.
The main critique for allowing immigrants into the United States is the claim that they take away jobs from Americans, but often overlooked is what immigrants bring to America. Many of them come here for education and America is able to reap the benefits of their knowledge and success. These students at Columbia have something to offer that could enhance the world, so what does it say that one of their fellow students has made them feel unwanted?
Carnegie Mellon and Columbia have a lot in common. In addition to being top-tier universities, both have a substantial international population that defines the experience for students at these schools. Our international students have always been assets, whether it’s their presence as a teaching assistant in an introductory course or their presence in one of Carnegie Mellon’s many research labs. It’s up to not only us as students to stand up and assert their right to be here, but it’s also up to the school’s administration to do so as well. Administrations must be there to support, protect, and stand up for their students.
Columbia and Carnegie Mellon are both also members of the Association of American Universities (AAU). Following the travel ban, the AAU released a petition calling for the termination of the ban in defense of the the international students represented by the 62 research universities that are a part of the organization. The AAU has three main reasons for supporting an end to the travel ban. The first is that it is discriminatory for only targeting certain countries and only people of certain religions from those countries. The second is that it is “detrimental to the national interests of the United States” because it limits the applicant pool for all of the institutions of higher learning in the United States. The last is because it places an unfair burden on the international students at AAU schools. This collective group of institutions recognizes that people come from all over the world to share their talents with us here in the United States and we need to make sure that nothing infringes on their abilities to pursue their education.
When acts of prejudice as outright as this happen at the type of school that’s supposed to be open to international students, it could send the talent that prospective international students have to offer elsewhere. In addition to recognizing that these students bring an immeasurable amount of talent to the United States, the AAU also recognizes that these students are people and that even if they aren’t participating in groundbreaking research or projects, they still deserve to feel like they belong in their academic communities.
An immigrant doesn’t have to be the next Albert Einstein to feel like they belong or add value to this country. While we don’t doubt that the students at Columbia will go on to do extraordinary things, they shouldn’t have to prove that they belong here by adopting western sounding names and abandoning their culture. We can’t let the rhetoric Trump has been preaching allow us to be complacent to random acts of prejudice that occur. We must be more vigilant now than ever. Just because someone who looks the other way on this type of behavior is now our president doesn’t mean that we can also just ignore these things. Trump and many other Americans wanting to go back to a time when diversity was scarce and America was “great” doesn’t mean that we can’t still hold them to the current standards for xenophobia.
If the rest of the country won’t stand with international students, then we as a campus community, along with universities everywhere, must stand together and protect our international classmates. They did not come here to ruin this country as Trump would like us to believe. They come here to advance not only our academics as a university, but to pursue the American dream promised to everyone that travels here, no matter what country they come from.

A hundred years ago, women did not have the right vote. Today, women not only have the right to vote, but can also hold public office. College education is no longer something reserved for men. In 2014, the world saw the first woman win a Nobel Prize in mathematics. In 2016, the United States saw the first female candidate nominated for president by a majority political party, and the first female campaign manager led a political candidate to a presidential victory. Yet, despite this progress, women are still lagging behind in law, politics, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Only we as a society can fix this problem.
Women gaining progress in STEM has been a long fought battle and one that has not advanced by much. According to statistics provided by the National Girls Collaborative Project, women make up half of the college-educated workforce in the United States, yet only 29 percent of the STEM workforce.
The reason behind the lack of women in STEM fields isn’t that women aren’t interested — according to a Girl Scouts' research study, 74 percent of girls express interest in STEM. Yet despite this difference, women still make up less than 30 percent of those who receive computer science degrees, as shown in a study done by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. Something happens to these young girls before they reach college. And unfortunately, it isn’t only in STEM fields where this gender bias occurs.
Gender bias is also present in politics and law. The American Bar Association released a study that found that that only 36 percent of those in the legal profession were women. Women in Congress make up less than 20 percent of the seats in the House and Senate. Women are still subject to sexism in the legal workplace, with many often mistaken as secretaries or finding themselves subject to remarks about trivial things such as a clothing.
While women are making progress — with women making up the majority of law school students for the first time — they are still far behind in STEM fields. As far as politics are concerned, at the current rate of progress, women won't achieve fair representation for almost 500 years. It is correct to assume that women are making progress, but this progress is not happening as fast as it must.
The gender bias present in STEM, law, and politics is a result of society, not any lower status in the face of the law. A study from the Women & Politics Institute at American University revealed that women are less likely than men to receive the suggestion from anyone to run for office. The study also found that women are more likely than men to perceive the electoral environment as highly competitive and biased against female candidates, which most likely is the result of the constant talk of how politics is biased against women, without offering any solutions on how to change it.
The lack of women in STEM, law, and politics is largely due to gender stereotypes against women. Women are often teased in schools and receive little encouragement in STEM interests. Somewhere along the line, women are either subconsciously or consciously told that they are not as smart as men, and a recent study showed that despite young women performing better than young males on tests, they are less likely to associate “female” with being “really, really smart.”
It isn’t enough to simply acknowledge that a gender gap exists in STEM, law, and politics — we need to change the way we as a society treat young women and girls. Constantly reminding these young women and girls of the bias against them is not going to achieve anything. The monumental changes begin with each and every American.
There is no need to tell young girls about how STEM, law, and political fields are biased against them. Instead, they need encouragement to study these fields. Current female engineers, scientists, attorneys, and politicians should become mentors for young girls and help give them the encouragement they need so these statistics become obsolete. The United States does not need a quota system for females to achieve equality in these male-dominated professions. Women have equal rights under the law, and there is no reason that women are not strong enough to build ourselves up without the help of the government.
Even those who aren’t women in STEM, law, and politics can help combat stereotypes and allow the gender gap to shrink in these fields. Empower women not through their bodies, but through their brains. If a young girl is interested in math, tell her about engineering. If she asks you why we haven’t had a female president, don’t tell her because there’s a gender gap in politics between men and women — tell her it is simply because she wasn’t born yet. Don’t remind her how she will have a long road ahead in STEM, law, and politics; she will learn this on her own.
Instead, we as a society need to focus on empowering these young girls in elementary and middle schools to study STEM, law, and politics, and assure them that they are brilliant individuals. Doing so is the only way we can stop writing articles about male dominated fields and shrink the gender gap, simply because these problems won’t exist anymore.

Right when the vast majority of American citizens checked their newsfeed and hypothetically asked themselves “what did Donald Trump do this time?”, Trump, over the National Prayer Breakfast, announced his wish to “totally destroy” the Johnson Amendment.
Add that to a list of jarring conversations held over a meal.
After a seemingly endless string of controversies and angry tweets, this may not have been a surprise, but the preexisting political chaos does not negate the potentially disastrous aftermath that the repeal of the Johnson Amendment can have on the United States, its citizens, and the core principles of which this country was founded on. 
The Johnson Amendment, enacted in 1954, is a tax code that “prohibits all 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations from endorsing or opposing political candidates.” Although this amendment is multifaceted and religious organizations are only one type of organization that are affected, there is a clear conflict of interest that emerges from this decision to overturn it — prominently, with the First Amendment.
The First Amendment is famous for protecting freedom of speech, but it also entails separation of church and state. When our founding fathers established this nation in 1776, they were escaping a nation where government was conflated with religion and hoped that this new nation would not repeat the same mistake. Over the years, America became a melting pot where people were gaining the right to practice their faith. Although the degree of religious tolerance in the United States is debatable, most can agree that, in theory, America’s core values cherish the “life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness” for all Americans. 
There are a multitude of incentives for Trump to meddle with the Johnson Amendment. Even before he was sworn into office in January, while on the campaign trail, he tried to pander to the evangelical votes. An overwhelming majority of white evangelicals voted for Trump in November 2016. Trump appealed to the evangelical voters for various reasons such as his promise to overturn Roe v. Wade, a court case which gave women the right to abortions, and his choice in running mate, former Indiana governor Mike Pence.
Overturning the Johnson Amendment would mean evangelists — especially televangelists — can contribute and invest more into politics than ever before, and Trump is cognizant of the power of the repeal. Jerry Falwell Jr., an early Trump endorser, states that “[Trump] thinks it is going to be a revolution in the Christian world.” Although Trump did not gain nearly as much support from non-white evangelists, the larger, wealthier, and more influential demographic that he has attracted far outweighs the lack of support he has received from other demographics.
Although these backers can afford the repeal of the Johnson Amendments, these are not the only people affected by the repeal. The Johnson Amendment also allows places of worship of all faith — not just Christianity — to be exempt from paying taxes. Many churches across the country rely on the donations of attendees in order to scrape by and make a living. That is merely scratching the surface — for minority religions, the numbers are usually more depressing. In order for Trump to get his hands on money from friends such as Mark Burns, pastor and evangelist who claims to “see the message of grace” in Trump, and Joel Osteen, pastor and televangelist who praised Trump as “a friend of our ministry”, Trump must first push more economic burdens down the throats of the countless listeners and their respective places of worship.
It is worth mentioning that this is not the first threat on the First Amendment that Trump has imposed. On the campaign trail, he stated he would “open up our libel laws” so that news organizations could be sued and he could “win lots of money.” His Twitter has been rampant with him calling out various media sources such as Cable News Network and the New York Times as “fake news”. He even tried to define freedom of the press in a Tweet, reading “It is not ‘freedom of the press’ when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!”
The Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative group that is in favor of religion being more prominent in the public space, "[argues] that [the Johnson Amendment] restricts free speech by censoring the content of a pastor's sermon,” thus possibly creating an argument that Trump is not, in fact, jeopardizing the First Amendment. However, what Trump and a significant portion of his supporters fail to realize is that the First Amendment is not just applicable when it is convenient to fulfill their own agenda and disposable in any other context.
Tomi Lahren, a public Trump supporter, claimed that Trump would “shake-up Washington.” Although many of her stances have been controversial, people from both sides of the political divide can probably agree that the White House has not been quite the same since the day Donald Trump transformed from businessman and television personality into 45th President of the United States.
In many respects, Trump has shaken up Washington. He “drained the swamp” and is in the process of re-swamping to unprecedented levels by filling his Cabinet with controversial choices such as Ben Carson for the United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and, more recently, Betsy DeVos for the United States Secretary of Education. His stance on the First Amendment has simply been the cherry on top of his colossal sundae that he has managed to make in mere weeks of being in office.
“Separation of church and state” has been something clamored about and cherished since America first became a sovereign nation. At the trajectory we are heading, we might find our nation back to where it was in 1776. Unfortunately, this time we do not have a “new world” to retreat to if we find our churches buying political power with cold, hard cash.

The latest installment of the saga of lawmakers attempting to dictate a woman’s choices in regards to her own body comes a law out of Arkansas, which bans all dilation and extraction (D&E) abortion procedures, the safest way for women to end pregnancies during the second trimester.
The bill, named the Unborn Child Protection From Dismemberment Abortion Act, is similar to D&E prohibitions that are in effect in Mississippi and West Virginia, and bans that have been introduced but blocked by the courts in Kansas, Oklahoma, Alabama, and Louisiana. It is being challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), because by prohibiting the most common and safest abortion procedure in the second trimester, it is essentially banning second trimester abortions, directly contradicting Roe v. Wade. The second trimester begins at week thirteen of the pregnancy, but Roe v. Wade protects a mother’s right to an abortion up until the fetus would be viable outside the womb, which is around 20-22 weeks of pregnancy.
Even more sinister, however, is a clause in the law that allows a woman’s husband, if he is the baby’s father, to sue her doctor for civil damages or injunctive relief, blocking the woman from being able to go forward with a D&E abortion. If the woman is a minor, her parents or legal guardians can also sue to stop the procedure.
The clause is included for the purpose of allowing women’s husbands and their guardians to retroactively sue doctors who have performed or attempted to perform D&E procedures and prevent those doctors from continuing to perform those operations. It wouldn’t allow for lawsuits to block other abortion procedures that are still legal, and would only allow for D&E procedures in progress to be blocked. It also wouldn’t allow for the woman in question to be sued, only her physician. It is included as a legal backup, in case the prohibition is not enough to stop doctors from performing the banned procedure. But although the clause is included to penalize doctors, it sets a terrifying precedent in the fight for a woman’s autonomy over her own body.
From a medical standpoint alone, an abortion is a procedure like any other, one that comes with inherent risks and, in the end, will have the most impact on the patient in question. What people often fail to consider, however, is that carrying a child to term and giving birth are medical undertakings that come with significant risks to the mother alone. A pregnant woman’s husband will not have to face anemia or morning sickness due to his wife’s pregnancy. The woman’s parents will not run the risk of internal bleeding or hypertension during delivery. It is the mother that bears the medical burdens in both cases, so it is the mother, and only the mother, who should decide which path to choose. By giving others the right to sue the doctor, thereby blocking the abortion, we are giving that choice to people who have no medical stakes in the decision.
This also sets a precedent regarding a woman’s power in her relationships. By dictating that a husband can take steps to halt an abortion in its tracks, the Arkansas government is giving an enormous amount of power to the husbands in question, a type of power that can be incredibly dangerous for expecting mothers.
It is estimated by the March of Dimes that almost one out of every six pregnant women have been abused by a partner. Abuse is often triggered by pregnancy, especially by unplanned pregnancy (which are often the types of pregnancies that require abortions), often attributed to jealousy or stress due to the prospect of financially supporting a child. Children further tie these women to the men that hurt them, because whether or not the woman decides to leave, she has a tie to her husband via her child.
A mother is also less likely to leave an abusive husband due to financial reasons. If she is trying to leave an abusive husband but has both herself and her child to worry about financially, it is harder for her to leave and become financially independent. Giving a woman access to an abortion gives her a way to escape dangerous and potentially life-threatening abusive situations like this, and giving a woman the power to make her own decisions regarding an abortion enables her to make this escape without permission or obstacle from an abusive husband.
The bill, and other similar laws, are dangerous to women and expectant mothers across the country. They don’t reduce abortion rates: they only force women in desperate situations to find other ways to terminate pregnancies. In a  study published in the Lancet medical journal,research showed that in countries where abortions are illegal, the number of abortions performed per 1,000 women is actually higher (37) than that in countries where abortions are legal (34).
Even though this act is called the Unborn Child Protection From Dismemberment Abortion Act, this is a misnomer. The choice to get an abortion is not an easy one. No one wants to get an abortion: they are expensive, inconvenient, and come with medical risks. A woman might decide to get an abortion because she knows she is not capable of raising a child, because she is carrying a child who has almost no chance of surviving outside of the womb, because she faces health risks, because she is stuck in an abusive relationship that a child would bind her to, or because of a variety of reasons that are completely valid and in her best interests as well as those of an unborn child who would have to be raised in dire conditions.
If a woman is desperate enough to make the choice to terminate a pregnancy, she is going to find a way to terminate that pregnancy, by illegal means if necessary.
Abortion bans do not protect unborn children: they put pregnant women at risk and take power away from women who have the right to make decisions in their best interests. In the end, the only person who should decide what happens to a woman’s body is the woman herself. A pregnant woman’s mother, father, or husband is not the person who should be making decisions regarding her health. The question of abortion is one to be brought up between a woman and her doctor, not a woman and the U.S. government.

On Wednesday, Feb. 1, Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos was scheduled to give a talk for the University of California Berkeley College Republicans club to the dismay of many Berkeley community members, who decided to protest. Ahead of the talk, however, around 150 masked outsiders from Oakland, CA interrupted the peaceful protest of Yiannopoulos and racism and began rioting, destroying university property and attacking Republicans on campus. As a result, the university canceled the event as a safety measure.
In the aftermath of the riot, Donald Trump, Yiannopoulos, and their supporters have claimed that, by cancelling the talk, the university attacked Yiannopoulos’s freedom of speech and should be punished. That perception contains a gross misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of freedom.
The First Amendment to the Constitution, the primary legal source of freedom in the United States, protects citizens from being limited in freedom by the government — but it says nothing about citizens’ abilities to silence one another. The student protestors, university, and outsider rioters were all private citizens, so, even ignoring the fact that he’s not an American citizen, Yiannopoulos cannot legally claim any infringement of rights.
In fact, if anyone’s freedom of speech was under attack here, it is that of the peaceful student protestors. Trump himself is now a member of the United States government, so any attempts on his part to silence citizens are officially censorship.
In his tweet about the Yianno-poulos-Berkeley affair, Trump sug-gested that Berkeley’s federal funding should be cut for cancelling Yiannopoulos’s talk. However, the violent rioters were in no way affiliated with the university, so the only roles that the university actually played were those of allowing students to speak out against Yiannopoulos’ hate speech, cancelling Yiannopoulos’ talk to protect its students and staff from the violent rioters, and even  sending out a message afterwards reaffirming its commitment to freedom of speech. If Trump were to actually cut funding to Berkeley, he, as a member of the United States government, would be punishing students for speaking out against their government, and that would be an infringement of first amendment rights.
The purpose of freedom in the United States is to help people live the happiest, healthiest lives possible. Freedom of speech ensures that vulnerable members of society have outlets to express their discontent without fear of punishment: Freedom of religion allows people openly believe whatever they want. Freedom of the press allows us to have knowledge about our nation and government and enables us to make fully informed decisions about our lives. All of these freedoms work to uphold the values of self-empowerment and nurturance, values that are undermined by Yiannopoulos’ hate speech. Supposedly, when Yiannopoulos spoke at Berkeley, he was going to publicly name undocumented Berkeley students. Undocumented immigrants are the sort of vulnerable Americans that constitutional freedoms are designed to protect.
If Yiannopoulos had spoken, he would have wrecked those students’ lives. At worst, these students would have been deported, ripping them away from their friends and lives in the United States. At the very least, they and their families would have had to live with a heightened fear of deportation. People living in fear are not living their happiest, healthiest lives. People living in fear are not free.
Yiannopoulos is advocating for the freedom to take away the freedom of others. That is unacceptable and goes against everything that America is supposed to stand for.

Where were you when you realized that Donald Trump was going to be the next President of the United States? Were you at home? At a watch party? Did you go to sleep early, confident in Hillary Clinton’s victory only to realize the next morning that nightmares don’t just happen in your dreams? I don’t think I’ll ever forget updating fivethirtyeight.com every 15 seconds and just watching Clinton’s win probability sink lower and lower.
Whether you were horrified by or ecstatic about the election results — or just about anywhere in between — you probably weren’t expecting it. Before the results started pouring in, even top staffers in Trump’s campaign were saying that they would need a miracle to win the election. And a miracle was exactly what they got: despite losing the popular vote by an unprecedented three million votes, they edged out the Clinton campaign by a few tens of thousands of votes in states that few experts, pundits, and campaign officials even realized were in play.
For years, journalists, political scientists, historians, and campaign strategists will be studying the perfect storm that dumped President Donald Trump on our doorstep. Hopefully, none more so than the leaders of the Democratic party. In 2016, Democrats had an ideal map to retake the United States Senate and were up against the least qualified and most objectionable presidential candidate in modern American history. Still, they managed to lose in both key races. Now, Democrats are the minority party throughout the federal government, and they are at a historic low in terms of control over state legislatures and governor’s mansions.
Sadly, many Democratic leaders are pointing to external obstacles, rather than accepting responsibility for defeat so they can tackle the problems that brought them down in 2016. For instance, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that Democrats "don't want a new direction," even after humiliating themselves in 2016. Many point to FBI Director James Comey, who delivered a last-minute blow to Clinton by reopening her investigation fewer than two weeks before the election. Many others point fingers at Wikileaks and Russian hackers, who were accused of targeting Clinton campaign officials expressly to elevate Trump’s campaign.
There is no doubt that both of these factors harmed her campaign. Perhaps, they even delivered the knockout blow. But given Clinton’s superior qualifications, temperament, and policy positions, the race shouldn’t have even been close enough that these factors could influence the outcome. That this race was still competitive in November is a serious testament to Clinton’s serious weaknesses as a candidate and the Democratic Party’s utter implosion. Furthermore, Clinton was only vulnerable to these factors because they reinforced flaws in her candidacy and with the Democratic Party overall. Finally, these factors do nothing to explain why Democrats performed below expectations in House and Senate races.
Democrats need to take responsibility for their failure, seriously investigate what went wrong in 2016, and propose a series of substantive reforms. Such reforms should have three goals: bring swing voters back into the fold, generate enthusiasm in their base, and expand to places where Democrats aren’t even competitive, such as rural areas around the United States, especially in the Deep South.
I am a young Democratic Party leader who plans on doing just that. Here at Carnegie Mellon University, I’m the President of the College Democrats. Elsewhere, I have years of experience as a political organizer and progressive activist, I’ll be working in progressive politics for the rest of my life. Over the course of the semester, I’ll be conducting an election “post-mortem,” to discover what happened, why it happened, and what Democrats need to do in the future to make sure this never happens again. I’ll be documenting my results in this column, Post-Mortem.
If there are three crucial states for Democrats to study, they are the three so-called “Blue Wall” states, which most Democrats thought were securely theirs, until suddenly they were not. These states are Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. In each of these states, the same three major factors contributed to the end-result. First, traditionally Democratic blue-collar voters flipped from Clinton to Trump. Second, turnout among rural voters, who favor Republicans, exceeded expectations. Finally, turnout among urban voters, who favor Democrats, was smaller than expected in each state’s biggest city.
I will focus my investigation in Pennsylvania, where blue-collar voters in Western PA flocked to Trump in droves, where rural voters in my own native Central PA have never responded to a candidate as ferociously as they did to Trump, and where voter turnout in Philadelphia was stunningly poor. 
For now, I’ll conclude on an important caveat: while Democrats need to take a serious look in the mirror, that doesn’t even compare with the soul-searching that must be done within the Republican Party. Unfortunately, no one wants to examine themselves too closely when they’re on top of the world because they might discover that the things they need to change are the very things that put them on top.
While Democrats ran an extremely flawed campaign, Republicans exploited racism, sexism, and xenophobia to win. They promoted a candidate who they knew was not only unqualified to serve as President but was also a clear threat to democracy, national security, and the world order. And they did so by exploiting fear, attacking the media, undermining America’s faith in democratic institutions, sowing doubt and confusion where matters of clear fact ought to prevail, and demagoguing women, people of color, Muslims, and immigrants. Democrats fought poorly for the right things while Republicans fought well for the wrong things.
By critiquing the Democratic Party, I do not wish to imply false equivalence between the magnitude of Democrats’ strategic failure and the magnitude of the GOP’s moral failure. I am critiquing the Democratic Party because that is an institution in which I have the credentials, authority, and investment to do so. Only Republicans can change their party, and I am calling on them to do the right thing. With that said, I want to be perfectly clear in stating that while Democrats must respond to their failure in 2016, the Democratic Party must never pull the pages out of Trump’s playbook that attack the most vulnerable people in our society. It is not worth it to gain the world but lose our souls. That is something that I and any other Democratic official must always bear in mind as we seek to move forward. See you next week!
