Football
 #18 Carnegie Mellon took on Westminster on Saturday night despite the day’s rain. The game didn’t get started until the end of the first quarter. Sophomore Nolan Pitsenberger intercepted the Titans with 1:40 left and returned the ball 64 yards for a touchdown.
For most of the game, it was a back-and-forth struggle between the Tartans and the Titans. It wasn’t until near the end of the game that graduate student Cole Hanna put the ball between the posts of the field goal, giving the Tartans a 10-0 victory over the Titans.
Westminster was the leader in offensive yards, totalling 212 total, while the Tartans only managed to get a total of 105 offensive yards. This was Carnegie Mellon’s fourth shutout in 15 years and extended their winning streak to 12 games — the longest active in Division III. 
The Tartans will be heading to Waynesburg University next Saturday, Oct. 8 for a 1:00 p.m. kickoff. 
Men’s Soccer
On Wednesday, Sept. 28, the #8 Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team took on Juniata College at home. In the seventh minute of the game, sophomore Billy Boucuvalas sunk one into the net to open the scoring early for The Tartans. Twenty minutes later, sophomore Jake Kavan finished a shot from Boucuvalas, putting Carnegie Mellon ahead 2-0. Only three minutes later, first-year Brendan Schonwetter continued the Tartan’s scoring streak in the first half after he headed a ball from a Boucuvalas’ corner kick. 
As the second half started, the Tartans’ scoring streak continued. Senior Kiran Sarvepalli picked up another goal for the team in the 49th minute, making it 4-0 Tartans. Not even five minutes later, the Tartans advanced to a 5-0 lead when sophomore Jake Slackman sunk another one into the net. While Juniata attempted to stage a last-second comeback with two goals in the final eight minutes of the game, Carnegie Mellon kept up their winning streak, advancing to 8-0-1 for the season.
The team would not find the same success when they took on New York University on Saturday, though. The Violets were able to score early in the eighth minute and again in the 68th minute, and the Tartans struggled to get on the board the entire game. As a result, the Tartans recorded a loss in their first University Athletic Association (UAA) game of the season, making their overall record 8-1-1. 
The men’s soccer team will be traveling to Brandeis University on Saturday, Oct. 8 for their next match. 
Women’s Soccer
The #8 Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team also took on New York University this past Saturday at home for their first UAA game of the season. The Violets took to the board early with goals in the sixth and seventh minutes, putting them ahead 2-0 over the The Tartans. 
Senior Alex Adams didn’t take long to respond; in the 16th minute, she converted a cross from first-year Jenna Hallbeck, making it 2-1 with the Violets still leading. Adams was once again able to convert in the 62nd minute after a cross from senior Helena Spencer, tying the game 2-2. Neither team was able to score again, ending the game in a 2-2 tie. This advanced the women’s soccer team to 6-1-2 on the season.
The team will be joining the men’s team when they travel to Brandeis University next Saturday, Oct. 8.
Men’s Tennis
The men’s tennis team wrapped up their fall play this past weekend when they traveled to Fredericksburg, Va. for the ITA Southeast Regional Tournament. In singles play, senior Matthew Poh was able to advance to the quarterfinals after winning three singles matches, but fell to the top seed, 6-2, 6-2. 
In doubles, two Tartan pairs made it to the Round of 16. The pair of junior Arjan Bedi and first-year Akshay Joshi won their first two matches, but lost their third match 8-3. Poh and junior Derek Wong had a first-round bye and won in the Round of 32, 8-7 (7-5), but later lost in the third round 8-6. 
Women’s Tennis
The women’s tennis team hosted West Liberty University this past Thursday and Friday, Sept. 29-30 for an invitational. In singles play, the Tartans won 10 of their 12 matches. Highlights include first-year Anika Joshi winning against two opponents 8-1, junior Danna Tayloe winning two matches 8-2 and 8-5, and first-year Divya Ventarama winning two matches 8-3 and 8-5. 
The Tartans fared similarly in doubles play, winning 11 of the 14 matches. Notably, Venkatarama played and won three matches, pairing with Taylor, Joshi, and junior Julieta Ruiz; the pairs all won in one set. Taylor also took home four victories, pairing with four different players. 
Members of the team will be heading to the ITA Cup in Rome, Ga. on Thursday, Oct. 13.

On Friday, Oct. 7, the Major League Baseball (MLB) Postseason will kick off with the Wild Card Series. The postseason will have a format that baseball fans have never seen before: six teams from both the National League and the American League will fight for the World Series title. The seeding is decided by each team’s regular season record. The top three seeds are represented by the three division winners (in MLB, there are three divisions in each league). The remaining three seeds are titled the “Wild Cards,” as they are the remaining three teams with the best records. The Wild Cards can be in any division, so there is potential for four teams from the same division to be in the playoffs. 
The top two seeds out of the six earn a bye through the first round. The remaining four teams will play a best-of-three game series with the three seed playing against the six seed and the four seed playing against the five seed. This bye is crucial for teams, as they get to rest for five days and set up their pitching rotation in any way they prefer. The other teams have to play a high-intensity three-game set with little room for error. The winners of the four/five series and the three/six series will move on to play the one and two seeds, respectively. This is known as the Division Series, which is a best out of five games or first to win three. After that there is only the Championship Series, which is a best of seven for the two remaining teams of both leagues. The World Series is the final matchup of the postseason where the best of the National League (NL) and Atlantic League (AL) face off. 
Although it is valuable to know the format of the playoffs, it is much more important to know which teams are going to compete for the trophy. Each ballclub comes with their own strengths and weaknesses, which can heavily influence their respective game plans. For example, the Washington Nationals won the 2019 World Series Championship by relying on their dominant starting pitching. The Baseball Postseason is incredibly tough and I would say it is more difficult to win a World Series than ever before considering there are more teams and more rounds. The regular season does not matter anymore and whoever plays the best ball in October is going to win it all. The Atlanta Braves just last year only had 88 wins in the regular season, but they were able to take down the 106-win Dodgers and the 95-win Astros en route to their championship. 
I will approach ranking the playoff teams in a number of tier lists. These may not mean much, but it will be interesting to look back at how I viewed each playoff team once it is all said and done. As we reach the later rounds, it will be much easier to see each club’s playoff formula and evaluate how they fare against the other remaining clubs.
The highest tier is “Championship Contenders,” as I believe these squads are far and away the best in baseball. The four squads in this tier are the Los Angeles Dodgers, Houston Astros, Atlanta Braves, and the New York Mets.
The Los Angeles Dodgers are on pace to win more than 110 games, which has not been done in the NL since 1909 by our very own Pittsburgh Pirates. Their lineup is easily the best in baseball with three MVP-caliber players at the top and a number of other great players to round out the bottom. The Dodgers lack the firepower of their starting rotations in years past, but they still fielded the lowest starter ERA this season. Their bullpen has also been statistically one of the best in the league as well. A championship win for this ballclub would put them in the conversation for greatest team of all time.
The Houston Astros are looking to return to the World Series after their loss in the Fall Classic last year. They have a Cy Young favorite in Justin Verlander to lead their pitching staff, as well as Yordan Alvarez to help power their lineup. Their rotation has been the model of consistency this season with six guys who can give you a quality start. This ballclub is very well-rounded with a ton of playoff experience, which makes them the easy favorites in the AL to win the pennant.
The Atlanta Braves want to be the first team to repeat as World Champs since the 2000 Yankees. They have one of the best bullpens in baseball with elite starters in addition. Their lineup features a number of great hitters who are going to compete every game. The Braves are primed for another deep run, whether they win the division or not.
The New York Mets are currently battling with the Braves for the NL East division title. They arguably have the strongest starting rotation in baseball with feared names Max Scherzer and Jacob Degrom at the top. Their closer Edwin Diaz has been nothing short of elite and their lineup is filled with scrappy hitters. It will be tough to oust this squad in a five or seven game series.
It is possible, even likely, that none of these teams will win the World Series, but I would not be surprised if it is one of them hoisting up that coveted trophy. 
The next tier is titled “Serious Competitors,” as these teams are not as good as the ones named previously, but they can make deep runs in the postseason. The ballclubs included are the New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, Cleveland Guardians, Seattle Mariners, and the Toronto Blue Jays.
The New York Yankees have MVP favorite Aaron Judge, but behind him there are some question marks. I almost placed them in the tier above, but their lineup and rotation have not completely sold me as of yet due to some identifiable holes. They still have great players at all corners of the diamond and the first round bye will certainly give them an advantage.
The St. Louis Cardinals have two NL MVP favorites in Paul Goldschmidt and Nolan Arenado, who will be impactful throughout the postseason. They also have a few young players who have shined bright as well as the experience of seasoned veterans, those being Albert Pujols, Yadier Molina, and Adam Wainwright, who all look to go out on top one last time. This mix of young and old could yield just the right magic for this squad to play far into October.
The Cleveland Guardians won the weak AL Central, but they strike me as a team that could easily go on a deep run. They have excellent starting pitching, a dominant closer at the back end, and a scrappy, young lineup that always plays 110%. This team is the youngest in baseball by average age, so the experience is not exactly there, but crazier things have happened.
The Seattle Mariners have not been to the playoffs since 2001, which is the longest drought in all four national sports. They just punched their ticket to dance and they could go even farther. They have a great pitching staff that they improved upon during the season with the acquisition of Luis Castillo. The lineup has me skeptical, but they can be great if certain guys step up, and the entire baseball world is excited to see the young rookie phenom Julio Rodriguez in the playoffs.
The Toronto Blue Jays have firepower throughout their batting lineup, as well as some key pitchers at the top of the rotation. As a team, they have underperformed in my eyes, but they could easily find themselves in the ALCS if the bats start going.
These ballclubs are still serious competitors, so I would not be surprised if a few of them end up in their respective Championship series. 
The final tier of my postseason rankings is “Could Make a Splash.” These teams are either just in the playoffs or still fighting for a spot. They all have the talent to shock the world and win it all, but it just does not seem as likely. These clubs are the Philadelphia Phillies, Tampa Bay Rays, San Diego Padres, and the Milwaukee Brewers.
The Philadelphia Phillies have a great pitching staff with recognizable names and their lineup has big boppers up and down. The downside is their bullpen is questionable and their hitters can go cold in an instant. This team could be in the above tier, but they need to prove themselves just a bit more.
The Tampa Bay Rays are an oddity in baseball as their philosophy is just different than most baseball fans are used to. They do find ways to win games without a high payroll, so though they have few notable names on their roster, they seem to get it done. They can easily win a series or two, but they lack the talent to be placed in a higher tier.
The Milwaukee Brewers have been disappointing the last two months of the season, as they dropped far and fast behind the Cardinals, who won the NL Central division title. They are on the outside looking in as they trail the Phillies for the final Wild Card spot. If they were to get in, they have a great rotation and good bullpen. The lineup does not frighten anybody outside of Christian Yelich, but they do have a method to succeed.
If these teams play their cards right, they could certainly make their mark in October. The Baltimore Orioles will not be in the postseason, but they deserve some respect as they had a winning season for the first time in years. Hopefully, this young squad can stay relevant in the coming years. 
After the World Series finishes up in early November, we can come back and laugh about how dumb I look with these tiers. Each ballclub will get their shot to prove me right or wrong and I will be watching it all unfold. October Baseball is the best baseball has to offer and I implore everybody to watch a game here or there. There is potential for some great matchups between absolute powerhouses as we go deeper into the playoffs. Something you have not seen before always seems to happen when watching a baseball game, and there is sure to be plenty of unforgettable moments starting later this week.

We always knew that the rankings would move around a little bit after Week 5, if only because of the clash between two top ten teams, Clemson and North Carolina State, which would inevitably see one of them out of the rankings. But what we didn’t know was that this would be the week of the almost-upset; of the ten top teams, five were seriously threatened late in the game. Yet when the dust settled, the ranks looked pretty similar to last week.
Our Rankings:
Without a loss, the top three — Alabama, Ohio State, and Georgia — were always going to stay the same, but their order is liable to move around. And here, it did. All three teams have been dominant all season, but Ohio State gets bumped up from #2 to #3 on the back of a thumping win over Rutgers, while Georgia, who were only saved in the final minutes of a 26-22 win over Missouri which featured an insane nine — yes, nine — field goals, dropped down to #3.
Realistically, the order of the top three doesn’t matter. None of them are going to fall below third unless they lose a game, but two of the three tried their damndest to lose last week. Alabama led comfortably, 28-0 against Arkansas before a hellish third quarter which saw their lead reduced to 28-23 and their starting quarterback, Bryce Young, sidelined with a shoulder injury. Yet the Crimson Tide did what they do best, and late in the game, pulled away. The final score was a comfortable 49-26, which doesn’t do justice to the scare the Razorbacks gave the Tide.
Ohio State had settled into third, and they’ve been playing like we’d expect a #3 team to play, beating Notre Dame in a tough game and winning blowouts, but with competition the likes of Arkansas State, Toledo, and Wisconsin — not teams that are expected to seriously compete. Saturday was no different, as the Buckeyes laid into Rutgers, beating them 49-10. While they haven’t been tested much recently, they go into a tough three-game stretch next, playing Michigan State, Iowa, and Penn State, in that order. For now, they’re at #2 — not because of their improvement, but because of Georgia’s recent inability to run up the score the way the Buckeyes have.
Georgia slots in at #3. The National Championship favorites have been struggling, and this makes it two weeks in a row. After running their first three opponents out of the stadium by a combined score of 130-10, the Bulldogs have played two tight games in a row, getting away from Kent State last week 39-22 and nearly losing to Missouri tonight, taking their first lead in the dying minutes of the fourth quarter. In every game they’ve played, Georgia has indisputably been the better football team. But can the Bulldogs stand up to the pressure every Sunday, or will they eventually crack and lose one notwithstanding? The injuries are starting to pile up for this team, and if they lose a game, Georgia’s playoff hopes will center on not only going undefeated from here on out, but also beating Alabama in the SEC Championship. That’s no small task.
At #4 comes Michigan, who struggled at the end against Iowa but ended up with a comfortable-looking 27-14 win. Fifth is Clemson, who beat North Carolina State — ranked #10 going into the weekend — 30-20. Sixth is USC, who looked shaky early, but pulled away from Arizona State to win, 42-25. At #7, Oklahoma State beat a very good Baylor team in a game that featured, inexplicably, almost no scoring outside of the third quarter, when the teams combined for 39 of the game’s 61 points. At #8 is Tennessee, who edged a formerly-ranked Florida squad. At #9, Ole Miss, new to the top ten after knocking off Kentucky by a score of 22-19. And finally, at #10 comes a Penn State squad which was unranked to start the season but hasn’t yet played a ranked team. Penn State’s next three games, against Michigan, Minnesota, and Ohio State, should test that, and we’ll see if this team is for real.
Looking forward to next week:
Next Week’s Schedule
While there are no matchups within the top ten and no games that jump off the page as upsets, there are still a few to watch. All of the top three are playing teams that — while objectively inferior skills-wise — have a tendency to disrupt good teams’ seasons. Alabama, in particular, will remember last year’s loss to Texas A&M which nearly cost them a playoff spot. Further down the ladder, Texas Tech and LSU both have upset potential playing Tennessee and Ole Miss, respectively, and Penn State is the only truly safe team. Don’t be surprised if there’s a lot of change in the rankings next week, and don’t be surprised if there’s no change at all. But stay on your toes, because Week 7 — the week after — will be a doozy. We’re getting into that part of the season where teams can start thinking about playoffs and conference championships, which means that in a few weeks we’ll start talking more about those things. And more importantly, it means that the games just take on that much added importance and the sport becomes that much more fun to watch.

Buggy is a Carnegie Mellon tradition which has existed since 1920. The sport, which is practiced throughout the academic year, culminates in an annual series of relay races held on each year’s Raceday during Spring Carnival, in which teams vie for the title of “Champion.” The Buggy Rolls Report column reports on the buggies and roll counts for all of the teams which attend the freeroll practices (“rolls”) each weekend organized by the Carnegie Mellon Sweepstakes Committee. All of the information reported in the column is provided by the Carnegie Mellon Sweepstakes Committee.
Due to inclement weather, likely resulting from the fringes of Hurricane Ian, rolls were cancelled for both Saturday and Sunday.
So, this week, we will have a brief recap of total roll counts so far this Fall semester. A total of seven teams have rolled on the course thus far. In what would have been last weekend's roll order, they are: Apex, SigEp (Sigma Phi Epsilon), SDC (The Carnegie Mellon Student Dormitory Council), SPIRIT, PiKA (Pi Kappa Alpha), Fringe, and CIA (The Carnegie Involvement Association).
Apex has tallied a total of 12 rolls for Molotov, split seven and five between two drivers, 10 rolls for Phoenix, split three and seven between two drivers, three rolls for Firefly, and seven rolls for Solaris.
SigEp has tallied a total of eight rolls for Barracuda.
SDC has tallied a total of two rolls for Vanity, three rolls for Avarice, and twelve rolls for Inferno.
SPIRIT has tallied a total of 12 rolls for Kingpin II, 13 rolls for Seraph, split six and seven between two drivers, nine rolls for Inviscid, and two rolls for Mapambazuko.
PiKA has tallied a total of 11 rolls for Banshee and 11 rolls for Raptor, split two, one, and eight, between three drivers.
Fringe has tallied a total of 10 rolls for Burnout and nine rolls for Blind Faith, split three and six between two drivers.
CIA has tallied a total of 10 rolls for Roadrunner, two rolls for Tempest, nine rolls for Emperor, 13 rolls for Kingfisher, and six rolls for Equinox.

The equations that describe scattering particles are covered in your average introductory physics course, but there is a hidden richness to this otherwise simple problem. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in understanding scattering through the lens of "quantum field theory." One property of collisions is that, rather intuitively, the odds of any two particles scattering becomes smaller as you decrease the momentum of one of the particles. In the limiting case where the momentum is zero, the probability becomes zero as well. 
Assistant Professor of Physics Riccardo Penco and two co-authors discovered something interesting about the "probability amplitudes" of phonon collision. Their finding was published in the journal "Physical Review Letters." In an interview with The Tartan, Penco explained how they "tweaked one of the main assumptions" of this problem by studying scattering in a medium, as opposed to a vacuum. "We looked at what happens when you scatter phonons off each other," he said.
Phonons are quasiparticles that represent sound, much like how photons carry electromagnetic radiation — light. As the momentum of the phonon became vanishingly small, the probability of phonon collision decreased proportionally to the particle's momentum raised to a fractional power, as opposed to the momentum to an integer power (essentially, it decreased according to the square root of x instead of x-squared). This means that the probability of collisions trends toward zero at a much slower rate. They are the first to demonstrate the probability curve can be proportional to a fractional power of momentum.
Penco described how co-author Tomáš Brauner invited him to a seminar in Stavanger, Norway, where they discussed the nature of particles scattered in fluid. They initially modeled this problem purely with code, but they kept noticing strange square-roots popping up in their probability curve. 
"We spent a lot of time trying to find a bug in our code … no one had ever seen this before," Penco said. When Angelo Esposito visited Carnegie Mellon sometime later, he helped them realize there was no bug, and that this was a novel discovery. "Sometimes it's a matter of putting together the right people at the right time at the right place."
Penco's research involves "physical systems that range in size from laboratory to cosmological scales," and he's studied everything from sound-waves to tides to black holes. He acknowledges that his research may seem to involve disparate topics, but he links them together through the lens of "effective field theory." He explained how his breadth-first approach to research is encouraged by the interdisciplinary culture at CMU, and he's been given "free reign" to pursue different topics. 
"To do research you need a certain mindset," Penco said. "There are people that like to get super deep in a subject and know every single thing written about it, and are very narrow. You need people like that, but you also need people to draw connections between things that researchers in isolation wouldn't put together."

In the world’s first demonstration of planetary defense technology, NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) successfully slammed into the asteroid Dimorphos on Sept. 26. 
This mission, whose spacecraft launched in November 2021 and spent 10 months in space before intercepting the asteroid, was intended to practice asteroid deflection methods and technology before a need arises from a risky asteroid in Earth's orbit. While the DART’s target asteroid doesn’t threaten Earth, it gives us a chance to test if intentionally crashing a spacecraft into an incoming asteroid will be enough to redirect its course and defend the planet, one of the leading ideas for planetary defense from incoming asteroids. While DART reports that there is “no known asteroid larger than 140 meters in size (that) has a significant chance to hit Earth in the next 100 years,” they acknowledge that our knowledge could be incomplete and preparation is better than complacency.
The asteroid Dimorphos was purposefully chosen for this test because it was located in an eclipsing binary system called Didymos, where Dimorphos passes in front of and behind the larger asteroid Didymos, meaning that Earth-based telescopes can measure changes easily. By looking at the regular variation of brightness from this binary asteroid system, scientists can observe the orbit before and after impact with relative ease. Andrew Rivkin of "The Planetary Science Journal" explains other benefits, like how the system is also the closest of the roughly 60 identified binary near-Earth asteroids, is close to Earth, and has an orbit that eclipses often enough for scientists to glean useful data. Additionally, Didymos is in a cycle where in 2022, the distance between Earth and Didymos was minimized to roughly seven million miles, making telescope observations higher quality. This combination of factors means that measurements can be taken efficiently and affordably, with contributions from scientists across the globe. 
Beyond careful asteroid selection, the DART mission was meticulously designed. The DART program notes that the Didymos system orbit doesn’t intersect Earth’s in current predictions, and that the energy from the crash is low enough to not disrupt the asteroid to the point where it would be a threat to Earth. Scientists completed complicated projections and created geometric models to determine the best trajectory for the spacecraft to have a successful journey and impact, and achieve mission goals. Rivkin explains these goals for a successful mission as four-fold: (1) intercept the Didymos asteroid, (2) cause at least a 73 second change in the binary orbital period, (3) have successful ground observations of the system to determine the orbital period change, and (4) measure momentum transfer of the impact, location and surface characteristics of the impact site, and estimate resulting changes to the Didymos system using ground-based or spacecraft-based observations. 
The initial results of this collision were photographed by both the Hubble Space telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, with simultaneous pictures taken of the asteroid both before and after the crash. As Leah Crane of NewScientist describes, this marks the first time that the two most powerful telescopes in service have simultaneously observed the same object. She furthers that such images and other readings from after the collision reveal the huge plumes of dust and debris that came off the asteroid, and that scientists plan to observe “how much Dimorphos’ orbit around Didymos changed, as well as the material properties of of the asteroid” to determine how successful the technology was at redirecting the asteroid from orbit. 
This also is crucial for application of this technology at home, because additional readings on how much material was blasted off Dimorphos as well as the direction and speed it hurtled away will help us prepare for similar impacts when the debris is near Earth. The Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope will continue to view Dimorphos over the next few months to monitor such changes and impacts.
Looking to the future, the DART program furthers that the Hera mission by the European Space Agency is the next launch to the Didymos system. With a planned launch in 2024, the main spacecraft and two companion cubesats are expected to rendezvous with the Didymos system in 2026. While there, they will “conduct detailed surveys on both asteroids, with particular focuses on the crater left by DART’s collision and a precise determination of the mass of Dimorphos.” Such readings will give us more insight into the outcomes of this test, and help us plan for uses of this technology for planetary defense. This collaboration comes from AIDA, the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment, which plans to use both missions to “extract the best possible information for planetary defense and Solar System science from these groundbreaking space missions.”
Hopefully, thanks to work by DART, if an asteroid did happen to come dangerously close to Earth, we’d know how to respond.

CMU RESEARCH ROUNDUP
New CMU building: The Richard King Mellon Hall of Sciences
Carnegie Mellon will begin construction on The Richard King Mellon Hall of Sciences, a new building funded by a $75 million grant. It will house classrooms, labs, and other work areas. These spaces are primarily for Biology, Chemistry departments and the Neuroscience Institute from the Mellon College of Science, as well as Computational Biology, Machine Learning departments and the Language Technologies Institute from the School of Computer Science. The Miller Institute for Contemporary Art will also relocate to this building from its current location in the Purnell Center for the Arts, doubling in gallery space and accommodating five times more visitors.
Delivering by drone
Many of us are used to seeing UPS and Amazon Prime trucks every week in the neighborhood. However, these vehicles can consume large amounts of energy as they travel between the warehouse to your house to fulfill your "one-day delivery" promise. This type of delivery is called last-mile delivery, and as consumer demands increase, so does energy usage and environmental impact of last-mile delivery.
But what about delivery drones? Researchers in Carnegie Mellon's civil and environmental engineering department have investigated the possibility of using drones instead of trucks for last-mile deliveries to reduce energy consumption. The team periodically interacted with organizations like Amazon, Pittsburgh Region Clean Cities, and the City of Pittsburgh to ensure that the experiment mirrored real-world conditions. 
In their paper in the August issue of "Patterns," the researchers reported that drones use 94 percent less energy per package than other vehicles. How much energy the drone used depended on payload mass, or the weight of the package, and delivery distance, so the most cost-effective deliveries were for materials that were light but valuable, such as medical supplies. Surprisingly, they found that wind and drone speed seemed to have little effect on energy consumption.
In practicality, drones work best with smaller packages, so larger packages would still need to be delivered via other methods. E-cargo bikes currently provide a good alternative while similarly not draining too much energy, and delivery robots are currently being developed as well, though their energy efficiency still depends greatly on the manufacturer.
NATIONAL NEWS
The latest in AI-generated art
While garnering differing opinions all around, AI-generated art is definitely on the hype train, making more advances and becoming more readily available to the public. Most of the recent hype comes from Craiyon or DALL-E mini, a publicly available copycat of OpenAI's DALL-E that similarly generates art from text prompts. (It was renamed Craiyon after complaints that DALL-E mini wasn't affiliated with DALL-E or OpenAI.) While Craiyon is considerably underpowered compared to OpenAI DALL-E, generating warped images and motifs, it did not stop the Internet from using it to generate up to 50,000 images each day of everything from politicians to aliens.
Now, there's even more publicly available AI art generators: on Sept. 28, OpenAI made their latest version of DALL-E, DALL-E 2, available to the public. This can at least expose users to a more moderated, more secure AI-art generator that even comes with a Risks and Limitations document explaining all of its potential issues, such as reinforcement of stereotypes. This newly public DALL-E 2 also comes with Outpainting, a feature added in August that allows users to expand an image or piece of art beyond its borders in a similar art style.
Almost as popular as DALL-E 2 is Stable Diffusion, launched on Sept. 10 and made public on Sept. 22. It similarly generates art from text-based prompts. Another platform is Midjourney, which launched its open beta on July 12 and can be operated using Discord, where you send a text prompt and receive a set of images based on it through a bot.
The popularity of DALL-E 2 and its spinoffs seem to have inspired bigger tech companies to dip their feet into text-based generative art: Meta released Make-A-Video on Sept. 29, a tool that generates videos based on text prompts. Meta previously released a paper on Make-A-Scene, which generates art based on text input and a sketch input. Google also announced Imagen in May, a text-based art generator that they claim produces images rated as higher quality by humans than DALL-E 2's images. Google also released DreamFusion recently, which generates 3D models based on text prompts. Few of these, other than DreamFusion, are currently available to the public.
There's still the question of how they get the data to generate their models because AI can only learn art from other people's art. Much of the data is not taken with consent from the authors, usually web-scraped from Google, Pinterest, and blog platforms like Wordpress, as was the case for Stable Diffusion. OpenAI has yet to release details on the hundreds of millions of images used for DALL-E 2, drawn from both publicly available sources and licensed sources. Companies like Meta and Google have also taken data from publicly available datasets made explicitly for non-commercial use, though it's doubtful Meta and Google are really using them for non-commercial uses. It's not that these companies aren't involved in the data collection however: they also heavily fund the organizations collecting the data. So the maneuvering appears to be a way to shift accountability from the companies to the smaller organizations they use to collect their data.

In a blog post, Vice President and General Manager of Google Stadia Phil Harrison announced that on Jan. 18, 2023, Google Stadia will be shutting down. As part of the shutdown, all Stadia hardware, game, and add-on content purchases will be refunded if they were made through the Google or Stadia store. These refunds are anticipated to be completed by mid-January 2023. 
Stadia is Google’s recent addition to the consumer gaming industry. It’s “Google’s gaming platform that lets you instantly play video games on screens you already own.” Essentially, using cloud streaming technology, users can use whatever device they have with an internet connection to play the games they own through Stadia. 
Unfortunately for Google, Stadia did not gain the popularity they were hoping for, and they have decided to terminate the project. The blog post noted that while the project will be shutting down, the groundwork of Stadia will be applied to other Google projects like YouTube, Google Play, and Google’s Augmented Reality efforts. Many members of the Stadia team will continue the work they were doing, but for other parts of the company. 
The sudden announcement of Stadia’s demise caught many game developers planning Stadia releases off guard. Tom Vian, who is half of SFB Games (“Snipperclips”), tweeted on Sept. 19 that he first heard of Stadia’s service discontinuing from an article. SFB Games launched “Tangled Tower” two days later on the Stadia store; the launch had been set ahead of the announcement. 
No More Robots, a video game publishing company, was put in a similar position. According to Mike Rose, the founder of No More Robots, the company was planning on publishing “Soccer Story” on Stadia in November. In a tweet, Rose wrote, “Who wants to guess that Google will refuse to pay us the money they owe us for it.” In a later tweet, he stated, “Hours later and I still have no email from Stadia, and no clarity on what’s happening with our games, deals, anything.”
Apparently, team members who worked on Stadia weren’t even aware the project was going to be terminated. In a Reddit thread on the Stadia subreddit, an alleged (former) Stadia engineer was notified the same morning of the blog post that the project was canceled with the line, “APOLOGIES FOR THE SHORT NOTICE.”  
One of the problems with Stadia’s shutdown is that it could lead to a large amount of e-waste. The Stadia controller — which cost $70 but is no longer available for purchase  — is not currently compatible with non-Stadia uses. According to the shop page, “The Stadia Controller connects directly to Google’s custom gaming data centers to deliver precise control.” As of writing, the controller offers no direct way to connect to a normal Bluetooth device besides for Google Stadia purposes. While the controller page advertises Bluetooth functionality, a disclaimer at the bottom states, “Product contains Bluetooth Classic radio. No Bluetooth Classic functionality is enabled at this time. Bluetooth Classic functionality may be implemented at a later date.” 
The controller will still be usable without a firmware update that unlocks the Bluetooth functionality, however. There is still the option to use the controller by plugging it into a USB port on a Smart TV, computer, or gaming console. There has also been a “Stadia Wireless” hack released on GitHub that makes the Stadia controller function like an Xbox controller through the use of a phone.

I'm still doing this, huh?
Just another classic issue of the great PILLBOX, edited by yours truly and written by a wide variety of genius writers producing works of genius every week for you all to hopefully appreciate. We write these articles not just for ourselves, but for you, our glorious readers.
Page 4 holds an article entitled "The Power of Man's Best Friend." I sure hope Haley Williams writes something hilarious yet analytical on the topic, perhaps by making the title an allusion to a recent Wes Anderson feature film.
Page 6, a slightly less than in depth analysis of one Robert Crumb, comic creating genius and also maybe misogynist and perhaps racist though definitely not a cool guy unless he is?
Page 8, a wonderful concert by wonderful musicians.
Page 10, more of Anna Cappella's intriguing semi-non-autobiographical story about life in CMU America.
Page 12, An interview with Shawn Koza, renaissance artist.
Page 14, a proto classic analysis of the themes and concepts of one film remake entitled "Scarface." Also featuring a lovely drawing of a blimp.
Page 18, William Curvan releases a poem that makes us all hem and haw.
And still the playlist.
What a wacky week,
Your beloved -- and loving -- Pillbox Editor.

Dear Cassandra,
I dragged myself in at 1 p.m. today, after what seemed like an infinite night. When you decide to actually use the hours between midnight and 5 a.m., it lends you a whole lot of freedom to do a whole lot of things. Last night, I decided to spend those precious hours at Henry’s place, sitting on his floor, talking about how much we both love Death Cab for Cutie. There was a lot to say, and it just took up the hours like only something so unimportant as love for a band could. Worry not though. I remain in the friend zone for now, having slept right where I sat — on his floor — when we determined that it was too late for me to walk home. 
    He did give me a blanket, though.
    I feel kind of like I’m about to sail right off the edge of a waterfall with this whole thing. It’s not that I like him excessively, though it's also not like I don’t like him. Obviously I like him; I slept on his floor. Maybe it’s Lou, and the feeling that I’m giving up on missing him. It’s become such a critical part of my identity that I just don’t know what I’ll do without it. Or if Henry would even be able to eclipse it, or if he even wants to. I kind of want to feel like I’ve thought about it before I just do it — so I’m clear on what I want, etc. But who is ever clear? I certainly would not want to be held responsible for being clear.
    When I finally got around to becoming a person again today, all I wanted was a Good Egg from ABP, but when I went, I realized that it would be wildly incomplete without the addition of a mango smoothie. There’s something just inherently healing about their smoothies — they way they’re creamy and icy at the same time. They just do everything they need to do without any fanfare or expectations from you. 
    I really needed a smoothie last Tuesday. It seems like everything has been going wrong in economics recently. I stare and stare at the notes and the lecture slides and nothing happens. I’m studying and working really hard and I’m just not seeing any results from it, and there are few things in the world that feel as truly horrible as that.
    Sometimes I’m sitting in Gates or in lecture and I think to myself: Do people know what happens to us in here? Do they really, truly know and understand? Surely, there must be some person high up in government or somewhere who is in charge of keeping them in check. The professors, the deans, etc. Someone has to make sure they’re doing things that make sense, that they’re not going to break us. If nobody’s checking, who’s to say that they won’t just do it? Just because they can? Because they can. I don’t trust them. I don’t really think anyone should trust them. 
    I don’t really trust myself recently, either. More weird things have been happening. Yesterday I stopped at my RA’s door — their name is Bea — because I had a question and when I got close, I could hear music playing inside. It wasn’t loud, but the doors also aren’t thick. I think it was “The Judge” by Twenty One Pilots. Which is a good song. 
    Anyways, I knocked, and nobody answered. I waited a few minutes; still nothing. I knocked again. I was kind of mad at this point; if they were in there they could have at least answered. 
    Then I heard a scream and the music stopped. 
    I shook the door handle and yelled their name and the door opened almost immediately under my hands, throwing me forward. Right into Bea.
    I asked them if they were okay, and they seemed really confused. They looked perfectly fine. They told me they’d just been in the bathroom, which is why they hadn’t answered the door. Not wanting to seem unhinged, I moved on, asked them my question, and left. That’s all.
Love,
    Maggie

(Disclaimer: Spoilers, naturally.)
“They just don’t make 'em like they used to.” No, they sure do not.
It is arduous to render the totality of the masterfulness that is Brian DePalma’s "Scarface." It amazes me that a movie is capable of presenting so satisfyingly the rise of Tony Montana (played expertly by Al Pacino), from a three-bit gangster into a drug lord kingpin, and then handing a brutal reprimanding to the viewer for wanting to see the extent of his lavish, stylized crime lifestyle, with an ultra-violent recoil against him. The picture serves as an interesting view on the
common person’s mind. It’s our guilty pleasure to keep watching, almost cheering on Tony’s rise through the narco-empire, and NO, that doesn’t make us terrible people. It means we are human. It is a part of us that wants to see the extent of Tony’s ambition and the movie knows. It plays on that fact well, teaching us a lesson on passing judgment and how fast everything can come crashing down.
When we meet Montana, he’s living through the Mariel Boatlift of 1980. Reagan is president; Castro’s Cuba is injecting criminals and innocents alike into the United States. Tony is a mere pawn in two nations’ game, but he has ambitions greater than being a puppet. In the first scene with him, when he is getting questioned by Floridian immigration police, we get to see the first of the fantastic acting by Pacino. He hooks us in, appeasing to our American sentimentalism: He is poisoned with hatred against communism; he abhors when people try to control him and what he can say or think. It is this which makes us root for Montana, a man willing to do anything to get ahead. The difference between the common person and Montana
however is that he is willing to do whatever it takes to get whatever he wants.
I believe this is a fantasy that everyone has had at some point in time, however silly and naïve. Perhaps that is why we love to indulge in romanticized gangster flicks. We want to see a rise to power staged as a revolt against common life, miserable commutes to work, waiting in line like every person, and most of all, having to be bootlickers to people higher in status than us. There is a reason why we smirk and guffaw when Frank (Robert Loggia) tells Montana, “You’re gonna find out your biggest problem won’t be bringing in the [drugs] but what to do with all the  cash!” THE MONEY, THE CARS, THE WOMEN, THE HOUSES, THE SUITS, THE POWER. Tony is our guilty fantasy of being able to have anything you want at a moment’s notice. Not to the extent of becoming a drug lord (I hope not anyways), but at least in our day to day lives. We all have those moments when we could say something, do something. We think of what we could do but we choose to stay put, stay silent. It makes us ponder, what would happen if, out of the blue, we stood up to the drivel we put up with everyday and made our presence known to our burdens.
One of the recurring messages that we see throughout the movie is “THE WORLD IS YOURS.” It is a calling to the audience. “Look what you can have if you just take the chance to get it.” Power and Greed sits on his shoulder like the devil and tempts Tony, and it is due to this indulgence that we witness the slow decline of Tony. I do not believe that Tony is naturally sin-seeking and maliciously evildoing for fun. He has some sense of morality. A horribly balanced and broken moral compass, sure, but he has his moments.
He is, at least at first, not a complete monster. He does want to better his family. He wants to see his mother stop slaving away in some factory and he wants to see his little sister, Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), stay out of the broken world of drugs, sex and vice he perpetuates. The latter, unfortunately, to a point of abusive over-protectionism, shown when he castigates his best friend, Manny (Steven Bauer) for even mentioning his sister's attractiveness. While he plans to blow up a political figure's car, he refuses to kill the guy's wife and two daughters. Hell, he even looks down on those who do, calling them cockroaches, as if he is
any better than them. It’s a very strange dichotomy. Montana is not completely separated from emotions and feelings and a sense of wickedness. It pokes at the fact that we love to judge people so much, as if we are saints, free from shortcomings, but when was the last time we looked upon ourselves and criticized our features and ideals? It is so much easier to steal things than earn them. Lying to make us seem more ideal to others is easier than chiseling ourselves into better people. Montana, or what he embodies, is closer to us than we think, and one of Scarface’s best features as a gangster film is that it puts us in front of such a mirror. It grabs all of us, the sinners and saints, and sits us down for a judgment of our true selves. Bringing us on this journey, it shows the end of what a life of brutality and vile aggression gets you: a glorified bloodbath of steel, smoke and death.
The rise and death of Tony Montana clearly has a Shakespearean influence. I think that it lies somewhere between “The Tragedy of Macbeth” and “The Tragedy of King Richard III.” The ambitions of Macbeth ring akin to Tony’s. He, too, both faces paranoia and dethrones a king-like drug baron. Like near the end of King Richard III, he is haunted by the killings he has committed. Pushing away his friends and his family, he is nothing but an ugly, broken husk of a human being. In ultimate anger, he takes on a small army and in a blaze of glory, he dies full of bullet holes (I know, King Richard III got stabbed, but it’s basically the same death scene). It’s a fantastic scene and one which went down as one of the best shootouts in cinema. I know because some people have never seen "Scarface," yet know the quote “Say hello to my little friend.” It’s a very height-of-the-war-on-drugs-moral-of-the-story ending: If you put yourself in a life of crime and drugs, you’ll ruin your life and everyone around you until you are dead or wish you were dead. I have no doubt in my mind it was designed that way. I have no doubt you couldn’t make that the point of the movie. I’m not accusing the movie of being propaganda, as it would be silly to bottle up the whole film into a single political talking point on narcotics, but the message is clear here.
The best scene in the entire movie, however, isn’t some shootout, and no, it’s not a person getting tortured with a chainsaw. It’s the dinner scene where Elvira (played by a then-unknown Michelle Pfeiffer) leaves Tony at the fancy restaurant after having it with his constant belittling. They were, from the beginning, two broken people in a marriage set to fail. Tony only saw Elvira as a trophy to obtain, to have his kids, and to serve no other purpose than cheap late-night
pleasures. Elvira was already herself in a broken marriage, so from one boring narco to another, chasing coke and pleasure, she fell for Tony. When Tony reveals to Manny and the audience that Elvira is infertile, implicitly due to the constant drugs which she consumes all the time, making her useless to him, there is no reason for Tony to continue being with Elvira. To him, she’s just a drug addict, one who will smoke and drink and snort themselves to a young grave. After Tony physically attacks her and she leaves him, he gives a broken monologue to the people around him.
These lines are perhaps the most important lines of the film, where he says that “everyone wishes they were him.” He states that we, the audience and the common people of society, wish that we were willing to break the rules, do what we want whenever, with whatever, with whoever. It’s ironic that he puts on a show of what such a life would get you. A childish temper tantrum of arrogance, macho-ism, and narcissism. The scene ends quietly with patrons returning to eating, living their lives. It’s an emotional performance with meaning that shouldn’t be overlooked, and shines as fantastic acting by Pacino and direction by DePalma, truly a great scene.
The last thing that I think I should touch upon is, of course, the soundtrack of the movie. To explain the effect of the music from this movie on our perception of the 80s as a significant part of the era would extend this analysis much further than it already is. The synth-y city pop and electronic post-disco songs give an unmatched vibe of what that era was like. The lyrics' references to coke, materialism and ambition are infamously good. The soundtrack album is truly something which both soundtrack savvy and general music lovers need to check out.
In conclusion, watch "Scarface." I understand that some people are hesitant to watch “old movies,” but from a modern perspective, there is nothing that makes this movie not hold up. There is a difference between art that’s timeless and art that’s outdated. Timeless art doesn’t lose its charm. It stands the test of time, and is significant enough to continually examine, even after its popularity fades. People listen to Chopin, read Shakespeare, watch “old movies” because classical music, classic literature, and classic movies alike are all significant enough that they can be appreciated forever, beyond their creators’ days. Naturally, outdated art is the complete opposite. They are fads, gimmicks, shocks in the market, and will be one day forgotten. There is only so much time to spend, so might as well make it something good, so try on this movie and you might gain an appreciation for the yesteryears of generations prior.
TL;DR, "Scarface" makes you question your judgment on others when your actions committed aren’t exactly saint-like either. It stands to show what happens when one relies on unchecked ambition, blithe
morality, and tries to solve everything through aggression and violence, and its consequences. Definitely a must watch. 8.75 out of 10

The Gates-Hillman Center
Floor 5
So dear and close I oft think 
I forget 
It's not my home
And still
I fear that those who trod this ground are lost
In their mind
In their lives
In their sighs
'Midst scattered chairs and hum-buzz lights 
Their upward longing lost to screens of code
I fear the grasp of obligation
I wear my mask of concentration
Losing myself 
Slowly
Yet
At my lowest
Salvation
I upward walk the spiral course
And luck upon a fine recourse
A sign that greets and whispers:
"Quiet Study Area"
But
The sign is not all
It
I ne'er have felt such rapture 
My affection is captured
By the Scream Chamber
O the Scream Chamber
What wonders hold'st in thine soundproof walls
Your door withstands whatever noise
I hurl at thee with manic joy
My head turns up and now returns
The longing with which my soul yearns
My dreams and life are back in hand
I have regained a hold And 
And
I leave
I feel a levity of heart
That only your embrace imparts
Thank you Scream Chamber
I feel better now

Despite the relatively small number of Wes Anderson’s films that I’ve seen, I would still call myself a Wes Anderson enthusiast, and I’ve been slowly making my way through his filmography as I dig myself deeper and deeper into my newest phase. This week I watched “Isle of Dogs,” (2018) a surprisingly grown up and mildly heart wrenching film with that classic Wes Anderson charm and very visually pleasing claymation style. “Isle of Dogs” follows a pack of dogs lead by lifelong stray Chief (voiced by Bryan Cranston) as they journey to reunite the young and dedicated Atari Kobayashi with his exiled dog Spots (voiced by Liev Schreiber). As this ragtag group of good boys journeys across the eponymous isle, Atari and Chief grow closer together and truly prove the undying loyalty of a dog to his boy. 
As previously mentioned, I really liked the animation for this movie. It’s a really stylistic stop-motion claymation, and I feel like it just meshes so well with the tone of the movie. It’s sweet, but everything is kind of distinctly grungy. The dogs, who have all been exiled to Trash Island by the corrupt, dog-hating mayor of Megasaki, all look dirty and boney, and you can really tell that these poor guys have been on this island digging through trash for scraps for way too long. One thing I wasn’t expecting from this movie was some mild claymation gore, but I also went in with the (incorrect) impression that this was a children’s movie, and I’m absolutely not upset about it. I love a good stylistic choice, and one of the things that really made me smile every time was the way they animated fights; it’s just a wad of stuffing with various limbs and objects flailing about. I really loved it, and this film is full of fun little mannerisms like that.
Another somewhat controversial choice of Anderson’s was the decision to have nearly all of the human dialogue in untranslated Japanese. There is one American character who speaks English, and some lines are translated through an interpreter as if we’re watching foreign political debates via news broadcasts. I personally loved this. I feel like it really puts the movie into the point of view of the dogs! It’s not about the politics of Megasaki — it’s about dogs and people coming together to be the companions they were meant to be, despite an obvious language barrier. 
The dogs don’t speak Japanese, and neither do I, but that doesn’t stop us from caring so deeply about Atari and deeply needing him to find his dog. The experience of loving your pet is just so universal; you don’t need any captions to understand what Atari is going through. Furthermore, I think the few translations allow for more impact on some heavier moments. One of the scenes that really stuck with me was a moment where we are getting our translations through an interpreter. As Mayor Kobayashi proposes the official decree to ban all dogs to Trash Island due to canine flu, the dogs seem to have no one on their side. However, Kobayashi’s opponent, Professor Watanabe, stands up and implores the people to wait just a bit longer, as he is on the brink of a cure to canine flu. The interpreter has been faithfully translating, but right at the end of Watanabe’s speech she pauses for a moment, before translating his closing line with such sorrow in her voice: “What ever happened to man’s best friend?” Oh my god. When I tell you I was fighting tears. As someone with dogs at home whom I miss very much, this really got me. I was honestly not expecting this movie to make me cry, and yet here we are. I fully believe that Wes Anderson is a genius, and that this moment would not have been the same with standard subtitles. 
You’re obviously not escaping this article without hearing me talk about the score. It’s mostly written and performed by Alexandre Desplat, who previously worked with Anderson on “The Fantastic Mr. Fox,” “Moonrise Kingdom,” and “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” but you may also know him from “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” (parts 1 and 2), “Little Women,” and “The Imitation Game.” I am a longtime Desplat stan, and I was absolutely delighted to find that he had done the score for this movie. It’s so good, and it fits just perfectly. Much of it has a very heavy, percussive feel, which goes well with some of the heavier themes and emotional moments of the movie. I also really love that some of the pieces have a bit of a goofier, almost spy-movie-esque feel for some of the sillier sequences, and they do a great job of lightening the mood for a sweet little break in the middle of being intensely concerned over the fate of this boy and his dog. 
As per usual, I really loved this movie. Honestly, I expected nothing less from my bestie Wes, but I still feel it needs to be said. It’s so sweet, and relatable, and full of love for dogs, it’s like animal abuse to not enjoy this movie. Literally, if I find out you didn’t like this movie, I’m calling ASPCA to report you. It’s a big victory for the dogs, and all the dog lovers! On the usual Haley "Good Time - Bad Time" scale, “Isle of Dogs” sits at a comfortable “crying happy tears for the love between a boy and his dog.”

Robert Crumb has been called many things, and he doesn’t seem to let it bother him: a racist (most strongly with his character of Angelfood McSpade) - “Oh yeah, but it all came from white liberals”; a foot fetishist - “I’m not fixated on feet, but I can get into them”; a misogynist - “I would be lying if I said I had no beef with the female of the species.”; and much more. He has been a cartoonist basically his whole life, and has made many works, both famous and infamous. He created Fritz the Cat, the cover of “Cheap Thrills”, and “Keep On Truckin,” the one-page comic emblematic of a hippie era. He’s supremely controversial, he’s wildly successful, he’s a great artist, and he’s one of the subjects of Terry Zwigoff’s acclaimed documentary "Crumb." The documentary, while superficially just about Crumb, also includes some of the rest of his family. We get to see brief snippets of his relationships with his son and fellow cartoonist Jesse Crumb, and his young daughter Sophie Crumb (described by Crumb as the only woman he’s ever loved.) We get frequent interviews with his wives and ex-girlfriends, which expose us to his sexual nature. He seems incredibly shy, yet is still very touchy in ways that can sometimes appear to make these women uncomfortable. He can in fact often seem uncomfortable with himself. When Dian Hanson, editor of various pornographic magazines and friend of Crumb, organizes a photoshoot for Crumb with some of her models that seem ripped straight from Crumb’s comix, we see how uncomfortable he is, demonstrating that his extreme depictions of women that we discuss later might be, although obviously sexually fetishistic for himself, also critiques of misogynistic values permeating the culture that Robert Crumb grew up in.
Robert Crumb is perhaps most infamous for the unique way he illustrated women in his comics. He frequently draws variations on what he calls the “Perfect Female Body.” This “Perfect Female Body according to the personal obsessions of R. Crumb” has many traits, including, ”Big lips full of teeth; Strong, straight back, strong neck & shoulders; Firm Breasts, size unimportant; Strong Arms; Round, full belly; Thick Ankles,” and most importantly: ”Large thighs, exaggerated forward pelvic thrust; and Exceptionally large, well-endowed but firm buttocks with ‘shelf’ effect.” He has an obsession with piggy back rides. The documentary shows multiple comics of his with his creations mounted on the backs of women, and we even see him be taken for a real life piggy back ride on the back of a former lover. All of this extreme illustration can be seen as misogynistic and reductionary. However, the women interviewed in "Crumb" often seem to have praise for this fixation of his, saying that it was the first time they felt represented and seen sexually. Crumb doesn’t only draw women in this way, as we see many instances
Crumb has been especially criticized for his often decapitation of women in his comics. Not literally, but the women he draws in stories are often headless, which can be seen as even more demeaning of women, female characters that he is most frequently putting in grotesque sexual situations. Is this satire on the role of women in the 60s, or is this demonstrations of a purely sexual nature? In this complex question, the answer seems to be both. Robert Crumb obviously and freely admits to getting off — at least on some level — to his work, but he also claims to be working in satire, and relatively obvious satire at that. Finally, we can see that Crumb puts much of himself into these comix, and that they can be seen as him making art about his worst traits.
But what is the difference between the Robert Crumb featured in his comix, and Robert Crumb the person? In some ways, there is very little. He has similar obsessions and draws himself very similarly. When Dian Hanson is asked about one of the similarities, she explains: “Yeah, that is one part that is very true. He is endowed with one of the biggest penises in the world.” But Crumb is not just this sexual being; he contains multitudes. When his art isn’t disgustingly sexual, he can make something like “Short History of America,” an introspective page detailing the rise of an American city, and what it left behind, with deep sentimentality. Or his famous comic “The Religious Experience of Philip K. Dick,” published in Weirdo #17, and maybe the definitive description of Dick’s VALIS incident, apart from Dick’s own writings. Crumb has an extreme attention to detail with everything he draws, and a focus on just his most obscene comix belies his true talents. The simple portraits that we see him making during the documentary are stunning, and he holds strongly consistent views, much more than many of his contemporaries in the scene. He doesn’t like to give autographs, and decries a modern culture that is “one unified field of bought and sold market research.” He has also been described as having “Such a sweet romantic vision of things” by Dana Morgan, his first wife.
Crumb is a man who has won. His wife, fellow cartoonist Aline Kominsky-Crumb, looks like Crumb’s ideal woman. He has reached the top of his field, adoration from fans, a position in the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame. But what of the rest of the Crumbs?
From what we see, the three Crumb brothers are all immensely talented cartoonists, but only Robert got immense success and popularity. So what happened to older brother Charles, and younger brother Maxon?
Well, all three brothers lived in a bad family situation. Their father was abusive, and their mother abused amphetamines, diet pills, and may have “Threatened to give [the brothers] enemas if [they] didn’t behave properly.” The brothers were all interested in cartooning, and were all shy and unpopular. Robert managed to leave his home after highschool, but Charles stayed. Charles was mentally ill, and claimed to have “homosexual pedophiliac tendancies” that he never acted upon. His art is interesting in its similarities to Robert’s work, but differentiates itself with interesting lines drawn inside the subjects that fill all the white space. Before the release of “Crumb,” Charles killed himself.
The younger brother Maxon had a history of sexually assaulting women, one that he describes almost as an afterthought in “Crumb.” We see him interviewed in a bare and decrepit apartment, where he shows his drawings, stylistically differentiated from those of the other Crumbs. He practices Buddhist meditation on a bed of nails, and we see him swallowing a rope of cloth to “cleanse his intestines,” which he passes through his entire body over the course of three days every six weeks.
"Crumb" by Terry Zwigoff is supremely fascinating. A viewing shows you so much about this scene, and all these incredibly compelling characters. It begets more. I haven’t described fully how fascinating Crumb and his family is, and I don’t think a full description of them is possible without just seeing the documentary. We are shown these people with a revealing honesty. Everyone should see this documentary, even those with absolutely no interest in the Comix scene. Zwigoff truly made a masterpiece. It is free to watch on the Internet Archive.

In late September, Koza released a new Hip-Hop/RnB album on Spotify and Apple Music, as well as other platforms. Having listened to the album a couple of times, I’d say that it’s a really good, chill album. It has perfect vibes for when you want to feel cool walking to class with your headphones in, truly big main character energy. Halley’s Comet seems to be the most popular song off the album as of now, and I can definitely see why. It’s really satisfying and melodic, and perfect for a chill vibes playlist. My personal favorite song is Sativa Leaf, which has a bit of a heavier feel than the rest of the album, but higher energy. I’d definitely recommend this album to anyone who likes RnB or Hip-Hop, or anyone who has met a girl at a party and imagined your potential future together.
In late September, Koza released a new Hip-Hop/RnB album on Spotify and Apple Music, as well as other platforms. The Tartan was able to speak to him this week and get his perspective on what the album means.
How long have you been making music, and what made you want to start?
“I’ve been making music for around 4 years
I started because I really liked rap and rhythm
And making melodies and writing raps was something I’ve always been doing but never took it seriously
Recorded my first song on my iphone”
What was your inspiration for this album?
“The inspiration for this album was all the immediate experience that you experience when coming to college/ or being placed in a new environment
You make new friends
You meet new romantic partners
And how in through all the excitement it’s important to remember that no matter how glamours everything seems
You have to be mindful that it’s not about that
And how it’s about understanding and getting to know people on a much deeper level”
Is there a message that you want people to pull from this album?
“The message that I’d want people to know is to feel confident in their passions and life pursuits
And that there are always people with them that support and believe in them
Because those are the people that see you for more than just pretty”
Do you have a favorite song on the album?
“My favorite song on the album is met her at a party which is the interlude, because that song was made in such authentic way, I literally went out earlier that night, met an a amazing person and then when we went to the studio later that night, I just reflected on my experiences earlier in the night. It was the first song that we decided to put on the album. And then Glair did his thing and created a great hook. The original song actually had a Jerry Mulligan piano sample that we couldn’t get cleared, so I reached out to my friend Charlotte at Berkeley School of Music who connect me with Nico who played a new jazz part that allowed us to finish the song
And then to top it off my best friend and executive producer of this album Mihael “Da Vinchi” Haule added the String section to further add to the Jazz-Rap combination on this song”
Is there anything else you want people to know going into this album?
“One of my best friends always says to live everyday like you’re gonna meet your soulmate next week. And honestly I don’t think she is wrong… But romanticizing romance these days can be heartbreaking and unfortunately a lot of people are gonna let us down. The toxic inner thoughts creep in and give us feelings we don’t need to feel, and tell us things we don’t need to hear… so instead you can listen to this:
You are Pretty
You are Loved
You Are Enough
It’s Not About Pretty because it’s about much more 
It’s about Love and I Love You 
Dedicated to the real lovers out there
Koza 
Executive Produced By: Mihael “Da Vinchi” Haule, Surya Vangala, Marcel Milewski, and Gowtham Irrinki”
What’s your album called, and where can people find it?
“The Album is called ‘It’s Not About Pretty’

Roughly 60 people gathered in front of “Walking to the Sky” last Monday to protest carceral technology. The march was organized by Against Carceral Tech (ACT), a joint effort between the Coalition Against Predictive Policing (CAPP) and CMU Against ICE. They advocated for a city-wide ban on facial recognition. 
Bonnie Fan, who received their masters degree from Heinz College in 2020, was one of the march’s organizers. They said that in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, the University made a commitment to support communities of color. Predictive policing and facial recognition technology — which are racially biased and disproportionately target Black and brown people — do not reflect this commitment, Fan told The Tartan. 
Over the summer, Carnegie Mellon proposed using facial recognition technology in criminal investigations. CAPP launched a petition against the prospective policy that garnered 418 signatures. Following community backlash, the University announced that it was no longer considering the proposal. 
A question that Fan said a lot of students are asking themselves is: “Do I work on a morally ambiguous project that could be used to harm people in the future?” Fan began their doctorate of philosophy in 2020 with Carnegie Mellon’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute but took this year off to consider the context and impact of their research. They hope that students will work as a community “to amplify each other’s power.”
Leaders from numerous groups spoke at the rally. Brandi Fisher, the president and CEO of the Alliance for Police Accountability, discussed harmful policing policies. “All police can do is arrest,” but often people need resources “so they can become whole individuals,” she said in her speech. 
Fisher discussed conditions at the Allegheny County Jail, the site for “a huge number of deaths in our backyard,” she said. The Pittsburgh Institute for Nonprofit Journalism reported that 13 men who were incarcerated at the ACJ have died since March 2020. Fisher advocated for people to attend ACJ Oversight Board meetings, which are open to the public and held on the first Thursday of the month. She also called for Orlando Harper, the jail’s warden, to be fired. 
As the march made its way down Forbes Avenue, buses lined up along the Carnegie Museum of Art. One rider disembarked and shouted that he was trying to get to work but the protest was blocking the buses. Organizers eventually directed protestors to the right side of the road to allow buses to pass. Many protesters were not students and few, if any, were undergraduates. 
Laura Perkins, the Emergency Response Organizer at Casa San Jose, discussed the impacts of carceral tech for immigrants. “Mass surveillance is not regulated,” she said at the rally. “Our community gets hurt by this system.” 
Representatives from CMU Better, the Abolitionist Law Center, and the local Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions chapter also spoke at the march. Graduate students at Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh discussed pay disparities and unionization efforts. 
Pat Hugh, a graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh, told protesters that academia does not exist within a vacuum. He said he continued his education “to improve the world” but realized that his AI research was funded by the Department of Defense, which helped him get the highest stipend possible. When he decided not to accept the DOD funding, he said, his pay took a hit. 
“We pretend our work is at the very least neutral,” Hugh said of researchers. But he told the crowd that harmful research has consequences.
Fan said they want students to practice “educating up.” They told The Tartan this means asking what happens to research: Where does it go? Who does it affect? 
“Everyone who’s doing their work strongly believes that they’re doing it for a good reason and good cause and I believe that it’s coming from a good place,” Fan said. “But then there are these blind spots about the impact on marginalized communities. You have to let go of some ego to admit that you made a mistake. And that can be deadly in academia, to admit that you’ve made a mistake.”
Fan recognized the support faculty who “want to uphold human rights and racial justice and bring forth the concerns of the community in their work.” They said that they want that commitment to be universally reflected in research funding and impact.

This Fall, a new restaurant opened to serve authentic Chinese noodles at the Cohon University Center: Revolution Noodle. Its opening was attributed to the combined effort of Chartwells, the University's dining service, and the owners of Hunan Express, another Chinese restaurant at Carnegie Mellon with an older history. 
As one of the owners of both Revolution Noodle and Hunan Express, Leilana Chen hoped to meet the food demands of the University’s diverse student population. “[Revolution Noodle] opened up because it was another concept … something different for the students to try and have more options,” Chen explained. 
A choice of noodle, protein, and broth, or a couple of buns with several different flavors — the menu of Revolution Noodle is very simple. However, the variety of options still brings a lot of excitement for students to test out different combinations. 
In terms of the most recommended option, Chen states that vermicelli noodles with braised beef can rarely go wrong. On the other hand, for Andrew Seo, Class of 2026, “egg noodles, spicy broth, beef and shrimp … as much cilantro as possible” was his go-to order. “I like Revolution Noodle because it was the only place where I could have a meal with warm broth,” added Seo. 
Even without having an initial expectation, business at Revolution Noodle turned out to be a success. “We are busy, and a lot of students really like it, and we have a lot of regular customers from Hunan too … even from outside the university,” said Chen. 
According to Chen, Revolution Noodle is still looking for changes to better serve its customers by improving cooking equipment and offering special proteins. Due to the high demand of buns, Revolution Noodle is now seeking help from Dining Services for bun-making equipment to replace the slow hand-making method. 
“We try to put in different types of meat … like today we had sliced pork, we had it three days ago and a lot of students liked it … so we tried to bring it back, then we tried a different one again such as pork ribs,” Chen said. “We try to have one pan of a different thing a day for students who like to try varieties, [and] won’t get tired of the same protein options.” 
The full interview with Leilana Chen is below.
My name is Leilani Chen, me and my husband own Revolution Noodle and Hunan Express. We had Hunan Express first, and we were asked to open a second spot so we opened Revolution Noodle.
The Tartan: What made you open this restaurant?
We have a restaurant outside of CMU, so we have different concepts, such as Hunan Bar in South Oakland. We have different experiences. Hunan Express was first serving authentic food, like a better, authentic Panda Express. This one we opened up because it was a different concept. Something for the students to try and have more options. Chartwells asked us if we knew how to do noodles. We gave them what we were able to do and they loved it.
Why the name Revolution Noodle?
The Revolution Noodle name came from Chartwells. We were going to do Hunan Noodle House but Chartwells wanted us to keep the name so it was Chartwells retired concept that they just wanted to use.
Who is Chartwells?
We are subcontracted with them. Another company that does food services for students in different kinds of universities.
How long have you been planning for Revolution Noodle?
Just this summer! We were invited to do this this summer and all summer long we’ve been trying to get it open.
What were some challenges you faced?
Pretty much getting it to open and the space. It’s how it is when you open up a restaurant with inflation and everything is so hard to get with equipment and whatnot, and you know getting repairs and stuff, everything else you’d expect that but we are used to it, but it’s more harder now because of Covid and employee-wise too. People who are fixing equipment are short of staff too.
How’s business so far?
So far it’s been good. We didn’t know what to expect or how we would be, but we were hoping it would be something like Hunan, and it is. We are busy and a lot of students really like it and we have a lot of regular customers from Hunan too. A lot of students love it, even from outside the university, regular customers from our restaurant come in and try it and everyone loves it.
I like it too.
It’s really a personal preference. That’s what I tell everyone. It’s really just what you like. Whether you like the concept of Hunan Express or noodle soup with bao buns. We are not in full swing yet for bao buns because we are still waiting for some equipment to get fixed for it. But the noodles are in full.
Any changes you are planning to implement?
Nothing much, trying to get to the swing of what students like. My husband has been doing some specials, like the same thing we do in Hunan, we try to put in different types of meat when we can so students are not getting tired of the regular options. So we have one or two pans of specials; like today we had sliced pork, we had it three days ago and a lot of students liked it and were looking for it, so we tried to bring it back then we tried a different one again such as pork ribs. So we try to have one pan of a different thing a day so students who like to try varieties won’t get tired of the same protein options.

When Andy Warhol is invoked, images such as the Campbell’s Soup Can, the Mao portrait, and the Marilyn Diptych immediately come to mind. Yet, the artist who famously popularized the term “15 minutes of fame” to aptly describe our throwaway culture may have his most enduring legacy with “Interview” magazine.
It is commonly known that Warhol had a wide range of passions, from art to music to film, pushing the boundaries of what was accepted with each avenue he explored. He indulged himself by collecting everything he came across and was genuinely enamored with a wide variety of topics. With an unfettered openness to explore new ideas and forge several new routes, Warhol’s approach strikes one as groundbreaking even today.
This is seen with “Interview,” which he established in the latter half of 1969. Warhol conducted interviews with celebrities, artists, and musicians; hence, the name of the magazine. The photo of the interviewee would be featured on the cover, edited in Warhol’s inimitable fashion.
Warhol was constantly surrounded by celebrities, so he took advantage of his social capital and took off running with "Interview". The magazine is still in circulation today even after Warhol’s passing in 1987.
To pay homage to his longest-running project, the Warhol Museum premiered a new exhibit on Saturday, Sept. 24 — “Andy Warhol’s Social Network: Interview, Television and Portraits.” Spearheaded by Chief Curator Jessica Beck and Director of The Andy Warhol Museum Patrick Moore, the exhibit looks at “Interview”; his television shows “Fashion,” “Warhol TV” and “Warhol’s Fifteen Minutes,” and his portraits of notable individuals.
Part of why “Interview” was so successful was because Warhol was engrossed by celebrities and could attract different types of them while making it appealing to the youth culture. This gave “Interview” staying power.
The exhibit features a collage of all 204 issues of “Interview” preceding Warhol’s passing, ranging from 1969 to 1987. It is truly something one needs to see in person, notable for its breadth and the sheer statement on celebrity it makes as one peruses the cover photos — some enduring legends and many other subjects memorializing their 15 minutes.
With all of the editions layed out, museum-goers see the evolution of “Interview.”  Warhol was not alone in the creative process of the covers. In 1965, Warhol met pop art icon Richard Bernstein at his first independent exhibition. Interestingly, Bernstein started with black-and-white photographs that he then transformed into the eye-popping images that grab everyone’s attention.
With the instant appeal on the covers from Bernstein and personal, uncut interviews with stars, such as Olivia Newton-John, Elvis Presley, Rob Lowe, and Matt Dillon, to name a few, the magazine’s popularity was unprecedented.
“Interview” was more than an aesthetic masterclass. Warhol Museum Director Patrick Moore explained, “Andy Warhol’s Social Network reveals the importance of Warhol’s integrated business practices, which tied together publishing, broadcast, and fine art through his social connections. The exhibition reveals that Warhol’s success was not a matter of luck or even artistic talent but a carefully considered web of influence set in the compressed world of New York City.”

Three people were injured at Kennywood Park on Sat., September 24, when a teenager opened fire outside the "Musik Express" ride. 
A 15-year-old boy and 39-year-old man were both shot in the leg, and another 15-year-old boy experienced a graze wound. The shooter opened fire with a handgun during the first day of Kennywood’s 20th annual Phantom Fall Fest, a Halloween-themed event hosted during the fall every year, 14 minutes before the park was closing for the night. The gunshots caused chaos as the crowd scrambled to escape, leading to additional injuries as park-goers were trampled attempting to get out of harm's way. 
Kaity Wang (CIT '25), a Carnegie Mellon student who often frequents the park, was shocked to hear about the shooting, but upon reflection said she was “not surprised” to hear that such an incident had occurred. While she did use the metal detectors when entering the park each time she visited last spring, she noted “there is an optional bag check that I bypass most of the time even though I carry a small book bag each time I go.” 
The security vulnerabilities of the park were obvious even to the most well-intentioned guests, as Wang furthers that the “outside fence of the park could also allow someone to slip weapons through the railings,” and reflected overall that she doesn’t “think Kennywood’s security is very strict and small flaws in their security system could cause instances like this.”
This comes even after Kennywood added a new security system over the summer. Jesse Bunch of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette explained that Kennywood started using a weapons detection system by Evolv Technology last June. The company advertises itself as an alternative to metal detectors that “combines sensors with artificial intelligence to detect threats at an ‘unprecedented speed and volume,’ allowing venues to forgo bag checks and hire fewer security workers.” This was the system in effect during the shooting, although it’s not known whether the weapon entered the park through this area or through other areas, like the holes in the outer fence.  
In an interview with Kennywood General Manager Mark Pauls by Julia Felton of TribLive, Pauls explained that this new system has worked in catching knives and guns of off-duty police officers, suggesting its effectiveness, and that the system experienced “no glitches" on Saturday. Pauls said that old metal detectors are soon being removed from the park to avoid guest confusion and increase confidence in the new Evolv system.  
In the wake of this incident, Kennywood is enhancing security further. On Wednesday, officials announced plans to double the number of police officers contracted to the park, enforce a chaperone policy where guests under 18 must have an adult age 21 or older with them, improve sightlines by removing trees along the fenceline, add floodlights and security patrols along the perimeter as well as additional spot-checking of bags, implement new limits on bag size, and restrict facial coverings to those used for the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The editorial board for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette commended officials for moving quickly after the shooting, stating that “for now, the additional security measures should suffice.” 
Wang said she will return to the park but “would be more cautious of my surroundings in the future. ... I have confidence in their promise to update security because they see so many families each day. They have to make sure people keep coming so the only way to not have people worrying about their safety is by tightening their security after this incident.”
This new awareness of the potential risks of crowded areas is reflected by many Pittsburgh residents and Kennywood attendees who heard about the shooting. Local news networks interviewed the Secure Community Network, which provided tips on public shooting survival, highlighting the importance of reacting “with the intention of staying out of harm’s way until law enforcement arrives.” They recommended running, hiding, or fighting: get as far away from the threat as possible, or if that fails try to get as much cover for the three to seven minutes it takes for law enforcement to arrive on site. If that fails, in the event of a close-range encounter, SCN representatives recommend “120 seconds of uncontrolled violence and rage” targeting the hand holding the weapon, pulling on any instincts to stay alive. Ideally, there’s always a chance to get away, but sometimes we don’t have that choice.

Last Monday, the National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower Edward Snowden was granted Russian citizenship by Vladimir Putin, joining a list of only 72 foreign-born people that Putin has granted citizenship to. Snowden has been living in Russia since 2013, when he escaped prosecution for leaking secret files on the NSA. 
The news isn’t completely unprecedented — Pjotr Sauer of the Guardian explained that Snowden initially began the citizenship process in 2020, stating that he didn’t want to be separated from his soon-to-be-born son “in an era of pandemics and closed borders.” He’s had permanent residency rights since 2020, making the recent change only the next step in a years-long process. 
“After years of separation from our parents, my wife and I have no desire to be separated from our sons,” Snowden explained in the Guardian’s article. “After two years of waiting and nearly ten years of exile, a little stability will make a difference for my family.”
Dave Davies of NPR explained that Edward Snowden, while working as an IT systems expert in contract for the NSA, traveled to Hong Kong to reveal thousands of top-secret documents about U.S. government surveillance on American citizens. While Snowden thought he was whistleblowing privacy abuses by the U.S. government in violation of the Constitution, the U.S. government saw him as a traitor due to the sensitive nature of these documents. There are similarly contrasting views on how this leaked information has impacted U.S. security. Snowden explained that he made the journalists agree to go to the government before publishing any information to ensure the information he provided was correct and that sharing it wouldn’t lead to direct harm. However, Richard Gonzales of NPR said the government’s point of view, which is that the reveals “did tremendous damage to the U.S.” with a report of examples of how Snowden has damaged national security, and the government spent millions to undo the damage. 
Despite such back and forth on what happened, the BBC reported that in 2020, NSA surveillance of telephone records, as exposed to the public by Snowden’s leak, was ruled unlawful by a federal appeals court. However, they further explain that this ruling does not impact Snowden’s conviction — a conviction that Snowden has yet to go to court for. While trying to leave Hong Kong and reach Ecuador for asylum, Snowden’s passport was canceled due to his new standing as a traitor of the U.S. government, leaving him stranded at a Russian airport. He was trapped there for 40 days, with Russian intelligence trying to convince him to reveal any secrets in exchange for assistance (he refused), and Snowden trying to apply for asylum in other countries (they refused). Thus, Davies explains, Snowden’s settlement in Russia was never according to plan, and Snowden still maintains that he lives a life completely independent from any support by the Russian government.
It’s not that Edward Snowden wouldn’t be willing to go on trial for his crimes — he just doesn’t believe it would be a fair trial. Jamie Grierson of the Guardian said that Snowden would be willing to return to the U.S. if guarantees could be made of a fair trial where he could present “a public interest defense of why this was done and allow a jury to decide.” However, Snowden told Davies, the government has claimed that there cannot be a defense for this particular crime, meaning the only subject on trial would be whether or not he shared information — which it seems very clear that he did. 
Whether or not Snowden ever stands trial will depend on whether the U.S. government decides to give him the type of trial he wants. But until then? It looks like he’s trying to make the best of his life in Russia, and stay close to his wife and son.

The Undergraduate Student Senate held their weekly meeting on Sept. 29 in the University Center Danforth Conference Room. The main focuses of the meeting were Special Allocations, a funding request from The Frame Gallery, and vacancy elections.
Bhangra in the Burgh requested $8,000 from Special Allocations to cover venue costs. The organization currently receives $10,028.76 from the Joint Funding Committee (JFC), anticipates $15,000 to $20,000 from ticket sales, and anticipates $2,000 from University Funding. The $8,000 requested funds is to cover Hospitality ($6,000) and Tech Operations ($2,000). The request was due to an unexpected cost associated with inflation, as the venue’s pricing increased by 33 percent. The request was approved. 
CMU Wrestling made a request of $8,070.84 for a new wrestling mat from Special Allocations. The mat would be used by wrestling, grappling, and MMA clubs. Currently, an old mat is being used; wrestling mats like what was requested usually have a lifespan between eight and 10 years. CMU Wrestling is currently on controlled probation from the JFC, which the club leadership was not aware of. There is a $2,000 line item in the club’s budget from the JFC which was not taken into consideration when the special allocations request was made. The Senate approved an allocation of $6,070.84, the difference between JFC funding and mat cost.
The Chess Club requested $3,000 from Special Allocations to reset and expand the club. This includes chess sets ($400), chess clocks ($600), Chess Club shirts ($250), snacks ($300), guest speakers and reservations ($300), tournaments prize pool ($750), and miscellaneous costs ($400). Due to defunct leadership last year, the Chess Club did not apply for JFC funding. The request was approved. 
The Frame Gallery, Carnegie Mellon’s on-campus student-run gallery, requested funding from the Senate to renovate since its current infrastructure is falling apart. Planned renovations would happen during the school year, but efforts would be focused during the spring. While construction is occurring, works would be displayed in a different gallery. There is currently a limit on how many people can be in the gallery due to the lack of a restroom. 
The total cost of the renovation is projected to be $270,753.62 — $137,167.98 from non-restroom-related expenses and $133,585.64 from restroom-related expenses. Between the School of Art, College of Fine Arts, Universal Access Committee, Housing Services, Provost’s Office, Dean of Students Office, and the JFC, $235,000 has been secured for renovations. $40,000 was requested from the Student Government Operating Reserve to cover the remaining costs of renovations. The motion was approved.
The last order of business was a vacancy election. Grace Oualline was elected to hold a Senate seat for the Mellon College of Science.

Content warning: nasty-ass descriptions of smallpox
Why in God’s good name is our government holding on to a ridiculously infectious and deadly disease that was meant to have been eradicated 50 years ago? The Center for Disease Control in Atlanta has stores of smallpox that they can’t realistically do anything with, and they refuse to get rid of it. They say they’re keeping it in case someone else decides to weaponize smallpox; however, that’s a stupid justification for a few reasons.
But first, a brief intro to smallpox. Smallpox is a terrible illness which ravaged the world for many centuries. The most common form of smallpox, variola major, presents initially with symptoms such as fever and body aches, along with red spots which develop into a rash on the tongue and in the mouth. Anytime the afflicted coughs, they send millions of little smallpox particles into the air around them.  As the disease incubates, the rash spreads to the hands and forearms, before slowly working its way inwards until your entire body is covered in pustules. The pustules will then scab over and eventually flake off, showering everyone around you with highly infectious variola confetti. This form has a mortality rate of approximately three in ten, and that’s not even the scariest version. 
Hemorrhagic smallpox is much rarer, but truly the stuff of nightmares, with a 100 percent mortality rate. Luckily for us, pox viruses are highly specific to individual species, so they can’t really spread to any other species. This means that a super awesome team of World Health Organization (WHO) doctors were able to eradicate smallpox from the natural world, and we haven’t had a case since 1977! These WHO scientists are literally my heroes, and it is honestly so disrespectful for the CDC to just spit in their face by hanging onto live samples of a disease that they worked so hard to eradicate. Before the eradication, a man named Edward Jenner noticed that French dairy maids who had been exposed to cowpox never got smallpox. In an insanely ballsy and unethical move, Jenner inoculated his gardener’s son. The boy never got smallpox after that, even after Jenner straight up injected the kid with variola. This was pretty much the first vaccination ever, and we literally get our word vaccination from variola vaccinia, the proper name for cowpox. Vaccination against smallpox via cowpox became common practice for a really long time after this, and it worked super well. However, since smallpox has been eradicated, most people born after the early 1970s weren’t vaccinated. Now that you have all the context, let’s get back to why the CDC makes me shake with rage.
As soon as smallpox was eradicated, there was a big push to destroy any stores of variola. We’ve gotten to the point where (theoretically) there are only two places in the world which still have stores of live smallpox: the CDC lab in Atlanta, Georgia, and the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology [VECTOR] in Novosibirsk, Siberia. There is no use for them, since there should theoretically never be another outbreak. This subject has been hotly debated since the 1980s, and is unfortunately still ongoing. Since the first meeting of smallpox experts and scientists, anyone who participated in the eradication effort (such as D.A. Henderson, my hero) has adamantly argued against retention, but Peter Jahrling (the true villain of this story) and his band of silly little military scientists want to keep on holding on to it just in case, because they’re like, pretty sure that smallpox probably exists outside of the two places it’s supposed to. They argue that it’s important to keep our variola, because it’s needed for research into potential vaccine improvements, as well as a possible alternative form of smallpox prevention for people who can’t get the vaccine (a.k.a., ME, stick around to find out why). However, this is very stupid of them. Even if they do somehow synthesize something that might possibly be effective against smallpox, there’s no way in hell it’s ever getting approved by the FDA because there are no humans with smallpox to test it on! Furthermore, the FDA will sometimes approve things before they’ve been tested on humans if they prove to be effective in animals which are affected in similar ways to humans, such as monkeys. 
Attentive readers will already see the problem with this: smallpox should only exist in humans. Unfortunately, Jahrling once again reared his ugly head and urged on more smallpox research. In summer of 2001, Jahrling and his team were able to do the impossible and managed to give smallpox (a HUMAN POX VIRUS) to a monkey (NON-HUMAN). I am so unbelievably angry about this every time I think about it. Are you fucking kidding me? The only redeeming quality of smallpox is that it has no carriers, and can really only survive in humans, and these bastards gave it to monkeys! The real kicker is that even though the monkeys got smallpox and presented symptoms similar to those in humans, they still can’t use it for research because in order to make the disease present as severely as it does in humans, they had to expose it to a horrifically massive amount of smallpox (somewhere around 100,000,000 times the infectious dose for humans). And guess what… the symptoms still weren’t close enough for the FDA. So now I just have to live with the knowledge that people are giving smallpox to monkeys for no good reason other than to try and make the monkey as sick as possible, with very little chance of actually getting something useful out of it. The research is literally going nowhere, and so there is no reason to keep holding on to the samples. Furthermore, a group from Canada in 2018 managed to recreate an honest to god extinct disease (horsepox) in a lab with relatively little funding and not much specialization. This literally sends every single reason for holding onto smallpox down the toilet. You can literally make smallpox in a lab cheap and easy if it really comes down to us really needing it for some reason. There is not a single reason left to hold onto variola.
While I do admit that there is good reason to believe that other countries have worked on weaponizing smallpox, the CDC as a whole is still on my shitlist. Even as they hold onto their stores of smallpox, just in case of a hypothetical bioterrorism event, they GOT RID OF MOST OF THEIR STORES OF THE VACCINE! This left me utterly flabbergasted when I found out. At one point, the stockpile was as low as 15 million doses of vaccine. If someone was to target a big city such as New York, with a population of 8.38 million people, do you have any clue how many people you would have to vaccinate to contain that outbreak? The main containment strategy for smallpox is called a ring vaccination; essentially, you just vaccinate every single close contact of anyone who’s been infected, and then you vaccinate the close contacts’ close contacts. That is such a ridiculously large number of people. What if multiple cities had been targeted at once? The CDC loves to act like they’ve really got a handle on the situation at all times but we would’ve been caught with our pants down for real if something had happened. Thankfully the CDC came to their senses in 2000 and ordered 40 million vaccines to be added to the stockpile, plus 155 million more after the anthrax attacks in 2001.The Strategic National Stockpile now has enough vaccines in storage to vaccinate every single person in the United States in the event of a smallpox outbreak. While this is great news for you, it unfortunately doesn’t actually help me that much. 
Ever since I learned that people with eczema (a.k.a. me) are ineligible to receive the smallpox vaccine, the thought of bioterrorism has been lurking in the back of my mind. You see, the smallpox vaccine causes a quite nasty infection in people with eczema, and it’s risky to even come into contact with people who’ve had the smallpox vaccine in the last 30 days if you’ve got eczema. Basically what this means is that in the event of a smallpox outbreak, I’m screwed. Even if everyone around me gets vaccinated (which I now believe is unlikely to happen, given recent events), I’ll still have to basically go into quarantine for a good long while as everyone stops being a threat to me just because they’ve been vaccinated. Pretty much my options are to get smallpox or get eczema vaccinatum (EV). Furthermore, EV is contagious to people without eczema! So just existing around the world where smallpox is no longer eradicated not only puts me at greater risk, but it puts my friends and family at risk also. It’s honestly so frightening to think about, and I’d really prefer it if this wasn’t something that I had to actually entertain the thought of.
I honestly believe that the best way to convince other people to destroy their stocks of variola is for the CDC to lead the way and get rid of theirs first. It’s like some sort of messed up smallpox game of chicken, where no one wants to be the first ones to get rid of their supply. The CDC and VECTOR both need to man up, have some goddamn common sense, and destroy their stocks of variola so that people like me can just have one moment of peace, and smallpox can finally just go to hell and stay eradicated for good.

From Carnegie Mellon to the world at-large, protests have always been an important sign of change. For instance, in 2011, members of the community protested Carnegie Mellon’s partnership with the Rwandan government, which has since resulted in CMU-Africa. This past week, protests came to Carnegie Mellon’s campus in a march “Against Carceral Tech.” 
On the other side of the world, protests are currently happening in Iran over the death of Masha Amini. Amini, a 22-year old woman from the Iranian Kurdish town Saquez, was arrested by the morality police for “unsuitable attire.” As of Sept. 30, more than 83 people have been killed in the protests. During 2020, Indian farmers protested controversial government reforms, with related protests happening as recently as August 2022.
As the Russo-Ukrainian war continues, citizens in Russia continue to protest. More than 1,000 people were detained in Russia following protests over the announcement of Russian President Valdimir Putin’s plans to draft more than 300,000 men to fight in Ukraine. The protestors’ resilience is certainly admirable, but their limited rights to protest against the Russian government mean danger to their well-being. Some who were detained for taking part in these protests were given draft papers, a practice defended by the Kremlin.
What exactly unites all these causes? The short answer is a sense of justice. Clearly each group has a different cause, but they are all fighting for what they believe in. Both grassroots and national protests play an important role in their respective systems.
For us at Carnegie Mellon, protests and petitions mean getting the attention of the administration so they hear the opinions of the community. When a petition circled over the summer to protest the use of facial recognition technology in police investigations, over 400 people signed. But it was still nearly 400 people short of its 800-signature goal. The petition may have helped push the University toward their July decision against implementing the policy, but it also shows that many students were either not informed of nor interested in speaking out against the proposal. 
When Dr. Uju Anya posted her tweets about Queen Elizabeth’s death, grad students sprang to action to draft a petition in Anya’s defense. This demonstrated the enthusiasm students had to stand up for their professor and the larger Carnegie Mellon community. 
Petitions are a powerful tool for protest. They may not feel as loud or incendiary as a public demonstration, but they are a critical first step for a movement. Petitions are the thesis statement guiding the development of protests. They help navigate activism and anchor its mission. 
Once a movement has rallied behind a petition, the work has truly started. From there, coalitions have to create community. Beyond the systemic changes that they may be pushing for, activist groups invite those interested to join a community of people who share similar values and ideologies. This support can be an integral way to mobilize people, empowering them to drop performative activism on social media and instead engage in productive organizing.
It’s important to recognize that without the ability to protest or petition, we would continue to be victims of a cycle that doesn’t care about what we have to say. Though those in the U.S. are fortunate enough to have the right to peacefully assemble and petition, it’s easy to forget others don’t.
We are very fortunate to have the ability to stand up for what we believe is right; it’s important that we exercise that freedom, even at the community level.

Novel-tea is The Tartan’s literary and language opinion column, so if you like hot takes and reading about cool ideas in the literary community then this is the place for you!! If you have your own hot take to add to this column, do not hesitate to contact us.
In the 2021-2022 school year, book bannings took on new life with “2,532 instances of individual books being banned, affecting 1,648 unique book titles”  from July 2021 to June 2022, according to PEN America. Among the titles listed on PEN America’s Index of School Book Bans, 41 percent directly speak to LGBTQ+ themes and characters, 40 percent have protagonists or prominent characters of color, 21 percent confront issues of race and racism, 22 percent have sexual content (which range from abortion, sexual assault, and pregnancy to informational stories about puberty, sex, and relationships), 10 percent address rights and activism, nine percent are types of biographies or memoirs, and four percent focus on religious minorities. 49 percent are young adult books which include these topics.
This strikingly speaks to what America’s values and fears are. Beginning with the first book banned in America which was likely Thomas Morton’s 1637 “New English Canaan” which scathingly attacked Puritan customs in light of Morton’s exile from the Puritan colony, book bannings reflect the beliefs of the societies in which they are challenged. 17th century Puritan colonies were consumed by self-image and religious piety, thus writing which demeans those values was treated seriously.
Today, the majority of books banned are young adult books, which makes sense as those who enforce book bans often claim they are for the good of America’s young. While this statement is a fallacy, it also reflects America’s fears. Professor Trisha Tucker writes, “Book bans gain traction in cultures that imagine themselves as upholding a barrier between the purity of children and the corruption of the world.” In America, there is a culture of simultaneously trying to protect children’s purity, yet also exposing them to the dangers of the world quite early on. In 2022 alone, there have been 32 school shootings which resulted in injury or death with 26 students and/or children being murdered. How can those who claim to want to protect America’s children and their education, also be willing to see them repeatedly murdered and traumatized? 
This hypocrisy speaks more to America than anything. The values being perpetuated here are not protecting children, but rather protecting youth complacency. In recent years, youth voices have been some of the loudest in calling out the most dire issues of our society. A big part of this young impetus is expanded access to information that has come with modern innovations in technology, media, and literature. Book banning is not an attempt to protect youth innocence — if that was the case then there would be more efforts to improve public school resources, teacher quality of life, and prevent going to school from being a life-threatening activity — rather it comes out of fear for the power of developing young critical thinkers (which is really all banning books prevents).
Furthermore, book bans close-off public knowledge and understanding of America, of all the controversies that exist here and affect everyone — especially America’s youth. As an article from The Atlantic explains, “Keeping books about certain types of children out of libraries perpetuates a vision of a sheltered American childhood that has rarely existed.”

“Don’t Worry Darling” is a psychological thriller that has been in the works since October 2020 and was released on Sept. 23. Director Olivia Wilde, along with the “Watermelon Sugar” singer Harry Styles and actress Florence Pugh, have been at the center of dramatic rumors regarding Styles and Wilde’s lack of professionalism on set for the past few months. Rumors first sparked when fans noticed Pugh’s lack of advertising of the film on social media, as she is known to promote all her works.
In late 2020, Wilde and Styles’ relationship rumors sparked when they were seen flirting with each other on set. They also started a wildfire on "stan" Twitter when the two were seen holding hands at the wedding of Styles’ agent, Jeff Azoff, in January 2021. Though the two never went on social media to confirm their relationship, they haven’t been very secretive about being together either. Their relationship also instigated rumors that Styles triggered Wilde’s split with Jason Sudeikis, Wilde’s years-long (ex) fiancé, but Sudeikis and Wilde seemed to be at a good place, as the two were pictured sharing a long hug one month after they broke off their engagement. Drama ensued as Pugh was reportedly fed up with the couple constantly disappearing on set.
But here’s the thing: We. Don’t. Care. Wilde went on Twitter before the release of the film to address all the rumors, and all of the co-stars can confirm that there’s no bad blood there. Even Harry-Spits-on-Chris-Pine-Gate is false, confirmed by Styles himself.
I mean, Jacob Elordi dated both of his co-stars on two different shows and the world didn’t seem to care. Our Twitter feeds were filled with how cute Eldordi and Joey King were together or how adorable he and Zendaya were. Even Ben Affleck dated three of his celebrity co-stars — Jennifer Garner, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jennifer Lopez — and nobody seemed to care. People just focused their excitement on how #Bennifer is back.
Most of these rumors came from anonymous sources, so we don’t even know the validity of them. I mean, there were a few months that people thought Holivia split it up, but in reality, they were just keeping things on the down-low.
Why does everyone seem to hop on the hate train when it comes to women dating their co-stars? And why is Wilde the only one on the receiving end of the hate? TikTok, Twitter, and Instagram only seem to praise Styles more and more each day. The rumors that he split up Sudeikis and Wilde didn’t seem to have as much effect on his career as it did Wilde’s. Wilde was accused of putting a man before the interests of her children (as Sudeikis and Wilde have three children together) and was accused of being an unprofessional director for allegedly showing up to set late with Styles all the time. Key word: allegedly.
Even though Wilde addressed claims of the so-called “feud” between her and Pugh in Vanity Fair’s October 2022 issue as “baseless,” social media didn’t care and still pushed the narrative of Wilde being the bad guy. Whatever happened to women supporting women? Are we going to keep pitting women in Hollywood against each other?
Wilde even took the heat for the whole Harry-spitting-on-Chris-Pine-drama which didn’t even happen. Two days before her movie was set to premiere, she was being asked about that drama on a talk show. I mean what director wants to be addressing drama before their two-year-in-the-making movie that millions of fans were anticipating is set to premiere?
So, no, stan Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, and literally every platform that is trashing Wilde’s career. We don’t care about the drama that only perpetuates sexist stereotypes. It’s time we stop giving second chances in Hollywood exclusively to men.

I have to say one of my most blessed Pittsburgh experiences is impatient drivers almost hitting me as I’m biking to campus. There’s nothing more exhilarating to wake me up than a two-ton SUV sliding less than six inches beside me as I’m about to turn onto Margaret Morrison Street from Forbes. I get it, me, a cyclist, is hindering you from getting to Starbucks by five seconds. Instead of almost hitting me, just run me over, coward. 
According to Pennsylvania law, “Motor vehicles must allow four feet of distance when overtaking a bicycle and travel at a careful and prudent speed. It is the motorist’s responsibility to provide this distance, not that of the cyclist.” When I’m biking down the road, I try my very best to not be a hindrance to the vehicles on the road. After all, their life is more valuable than mine because they are paying $4.00 for a gallon of gasoline, and here I am freeloading, not bowing to our fossil fuel gods. 
I will say, most motorists on the road respect those on bikes, scooters, skateboards, etc. Thank you! But the real problem is those that don’t. This includes people who are distracted when driving, impatient, or simply ignorant. Bikers are expected to stay as far right on the road as they safely can. For me, this means about four feet from cars that are parked on the side of the road so I don’t become a victim of “dooring.” Dooring occurs when a bicyclist is injured or killed when a door is opened in their line of travel. Not the ideal way to go, I think. In Pittsburgh, there are about 57 accidents involving bicyclists every year. 
As unfortunate as it is, I don’t feel completely safe riding my bike on the streets of Pittsburgh even though there is no good reason why I shouldn’t. Why should the source of one-fifth of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States be favored over zero-emission transportation like biking? The short answer is because that’s just the way it’s always been. Only 15 percent of people who live in the City of Pittsburgh said that they use biking as a form of transportation.
However, it’s important to note that 73 percent of motorists said they would be more likely to bike if there were more protected bike lanes, more trails, fewer aggressive drivers, and/or low volume, slower-speed streets. 
It’s not just those who would use the bike lanes that believe they would prove useful. 83 percent of motorists also believe that people on bikes should have a dedicated lane or facility to ride in to reduce the possibility of accidents. This sentiment was especially high in people of color (95 percent) and women (87 percent), according to a 2020 report commissioned by the City.
In June 2020, the City of Pittsburgh released the “Bike(+)” plan. The plan “lays out a vision for a safe and connected network of on-street and off street (sic) facilities that will enable people of all ages and abilities to travel by bicycle and other small mobility modes.” In total, the plan proposes a total 150 additional miles of biking facilities, bringing the total up to 243 miles. Notably, the plan lays arrangements for bike lanes on Forbes Avenue in Squirrel Hill, Beeler Street, and Wilkins Avenue. Even if a street has a bike lane in only one direction, it is marked as having bike lanes. For instance, Forbes Avenue from Carnegie Mellon to Schenley Drive is marked as already having a bike lane despite it only being uphill (I, for one, would appreciate one going downhill as well.). 
But is this really enough? Don’t get me wrong, I do appreciate the efforts to make Pittsburgh a more bikeable place. I want to know that I won’t get hit because someone thought they could make it past me while only giving me six inches of room. I want to know I won’t get hit because someone was looking at their phone or wasn’t paying attention. 
Amsterdam, a city known for how bikeable it is, has the answers to some of these concerns. This is because a lot of the design decisions are made with bikers in mind. Pittsburgh, on the other hand, really doesn’t have that vibe. Granted that a lot of Pittsburgh’s infrastructure is already in place and car-dominated, that doesn’t mean it's ever too late for more bike-friendly decisions to be made. Here’s to hoping that one day I don’t have to worry about cars smashing into me as I bike through Pittsburgh.

After a historic national election in Italy, the Monday, Sept. 26 results showed a clear victory for a right-wing coalition led by the Brothers of Italy party. The victory made it almost certain that its leader Giorgia Meloni would be Italy’s first female prime minister.
The victory has reverberated globally and is a contentious topic of conversation in the United States, not because Meloni would be the first female prime minister but because of her alleged fascist beliefs. “Far-right,” “fascist,” and “extremist” are some of the most common malapropisms that have been thrown around recently. But is it fair to characterize Meloni as such?
It is hard to trust the American media when so much of it is in the custody of extreme narratives on the left and the right. It seems as though whenever the left-facing media identifies someone who does not follow their agenda, they try to silence them by censoring or associating them with a universally objectionable ideology like fascism. That is not to say that the far-right media does not do the same. They are guilty of using similar sensationalist tactics.
So when Meloni and the Brothers of Italy won the election, the response was predictable, to say the least. The left screamed “fascist.” But when you use a term like “fascist” so often, it begins to lose meaning and deflects from the real issues at hand. I am not arguing that there are no fascists in Italian politics, but evidence supports that Meloni does not fit the bill.
Giorgia Meloni is a capable woman who has traditional values. Some policies of hers are ones that Americans may not support or find questionable. Of course, using the slogan “G-d, Family, and Country” made her the subject of much criticism, drawing comparisons to WWII-era fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, which is an outrageous comparison. It is a cheap and ignorant shot.  Additionally, the use of “far-right” to describe Meloni is also frustrating since she is really “center-right” on the majority of issues.
One of the issues is that left-wing media has done a good job at releasing a flurry of articles to defame Meloni. A simple Google search would lead one to believe that Meloni is the second coming of Mussolini. But why is it more difficult to find unbiased reporting on Meloni’s views?  An explanation: censorship.
For example, YouTube removed videos from 2019 of Meloni for simply discussing her views. After receiving criticism, YouTube reversed course and re-uploaded the videos. When people watched the videos, they saw that her remarks were aligned with common new-right political views.
Big tech should not make learning about Meloni’s views harder. The issue lies in the media with how they do not allow people to make an informed decision as they are so quick to brand someone.
Yes, Meloni’s political views are conservative, and some are sure to inflame her opponents.  She has strict policies against illegal immigration and believes in the idea of a “traditional family.” These are hot-button issues in the Catholic country, and they become talking points in countries that are following from afar, such as the United States, where the issues resonate differently. Context is not part of the resulting coverage when it is easier to lazily brand someone.
It would also be irresponsible of me to ignore that her party does have its roots in fascism. Again, context is required as it is complicated to understand because Italy’s political history is much different from that of the United States. It is also different from that of Germany. Unlike Germany, which has rid itself of Hitlerism, Italian politics have not yet moved past Mussolini.  The Mussolini family is still politically involved. Rachele Mussolini, one of Mussolini’s grandchildren, is an elected member of the Brothers of Italy.
Sometimes, far-right members in the United States accuse individuals of being communists.  However, hardly anyone in American mainstream politics genuinely presents themselves as a communist. In Italy, there are real communists, a part of prominent communist parties. In the same way, there are parties descended from communist parties; likewise, there are parties that are descended from fascist parties. That is a part of Italian history. No one can deny that.  But Meloni said her party is no longer fascist.
Italy’s tumultuous political history can be hard for Americans to understand. Despite the fact it is a woman fronting a party that had no representation in the last governmental coalition, rivals are now disputing her credentials as a woman, dubbing her “anti-woman” because her feminism is allegedly subpar.
Yet, there has been pushback from the unlikeliest of sources; her liberal opponent, former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who spoke in Meloni’s defense: “Personally, I was against Giorgia Meloni. I’m not her best friend. We are rivals, but she is not a danger to democracy. The idea there is a risk of fascism in Italy is absolutely fake news.”
These accusations no longer work, as evidenced by the fact that the Italian public voted for Meloni. They voted for her in spite of everything that was said about her.  Why?  Because she relates to traditional Italian values and identifies as a mother, a Catholic, an Italian, and wants what is best for the Italian people. Meloni is gutsy, and she needs to be so for the needs of the Italians, especially in the poorer South, which is too often neglected by the ruling parties of the North.
Because Italian governments are coalitions, Meloni will be forced to have more moderate views. Meloni is a fresh look that has the potential to bring the other parties together. Her party ran on a platform of change for a country that has had a hard time agreeing on a unified vision.
The coalition system makes it so others will be brought in and heard.  This fact alone should be reassuring to those concerned about a right-wing stronghold. Rather than rushing to judgment, it's time the media lets the facts speak for themselves instead of being so quick to brand someone without providing context. Too many coalitions in Italy have struggled to last more than five minutes. She needs to be given a chance to succeed.
