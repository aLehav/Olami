It’s been three months since George Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, and where are we now? After the shooting of Jacob Blake, it feels like the same old song and dance: another unarmed Black man, another white police officer, another seven bullets in the back of someone who didn’t deserve to get shot. Okay. What can we do about it?
Along with everything else, the sports world was affected by Floyd’s death. With the Black Lives Matter movement taking center stage during quarantine, athletes did what they could to collectivize, show their support, and speak out against the atrocity. NHL players formed the Hockey Diversity Alliance to help players of color find a voice in a predominantly white league, culminating in a moment of silence for victims of police brutality before the first playoff puck hit the ice. The Pittsburgh Pirates draped a massive Black Lives Matter banner over their rotunda in left field. The NFL team in Washington removed their longtime nickname. Lebron James wore a hat with Breonna Taylor’s name on it. The question remains: is there something else these guys could be doing?
Chris Paul, Oklahoma City Thunder star, said something about it. Immediately after a playoff win against the Houston Rockets, while still in uniform, still on the court, still breathing heavy, he made no mistake in answering TNT’s Stephanie Ready:
Ready: "The series is tied now. What did you find at the end of this game that helped you guys pull away?"
Paul: "I don't know. That's all good and well. I just want to send my prayers out to Jacob Blake and their family. The things we decided to come down here to play for, and we said we're going to speak on the social injustice and the things that continue to happen to our people. It's not right. It's not right. So the win is good, but voting is real. I'm going to challenge all my NBA guys, other sports guys: Let's try to get our entire teams registered to vote. There's a lot of stuff going on in the country. You know, sports — it's cool, it's good and well, that's how we take care of our families. But those are the real issues that we've got to start addressing."
Those real issues were subsequently addressed by the Milwaukee Bucks, who chose not to play Game 5 of their own first-round playoff series against the Orlando Magic. After that, the rest of the NBA players followed suit, shutting down for a few days, an act of solidarity with Black America that the sports world has simply not seen before.
The protests extended into every other major sports league in the country, with three games in Major League Baseball being called off by the players on Wednesday, including the Milwaukee Brewers game. The National Hockey League postponed their playoffs as well, led by Matt Dumba, a defenseman for the Minnesota Wild, and the rest of the NHL’s newly formed Hockey Diversity Alliance.
Players from all corners of the sports world spoke out against police violence. Ryan Reaves, Vegas Golden Knights Enforcer, spoke to the media behind several dozen fellow NHLers: "It's great that the NBA did this and the MLB, WNBA; they have a lot of Black players in those leagues. But for all these athletes in here to take a stand and say, ‘we see the problem too and we stand behind you.’ I'd go to war with these guys. I hate their guts on the ice, but I couldn't be more proud of these guys."
Reaves went on to note that a simple statement of solidarity wasn’t going to fix anything — it was nothing more than a show of support — but let’s go back to that question: Is there something else these guys can do? There’s always more that can be done in the fight against racial injustice. These athletes could be donating large portions of their substantial salaries to local organizations who help take care of underprivileged folks in poor communities, but there are already a few athletes who have. Longtime Pittsburgh Steelers Center Maurkice Pouncey, for example, has a charity devoted to helping underprivileged youth.
These guys have charities, and they have put their money where their mouth is already. Realistically, this is the next logical step. Collectivizing as a group, forcing people to listen to you, and saying what needs to be said.

On June 9, the Institute for Politics and Strategy (IPS) at Carnegie Mellon announced the hiring of Richard Grenell as a Senior Fellow. Grenell had formerly served as the United States Ambassador to Germany and the acting Director of National Intelligence in the Trump administration. The appointment sparked nearly instant backlash among students and faculty. Many felt Grenell’s divisive rhetoric, particularly on his Twitter account, had no place at Carnegie Mellon. 
Much of Grenell’s controversial punditry takes place on Twitter. He frequently tweets in defense of President Donald Trump, calling the president’s June photo op at St. John's Church amid the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests “a triumphant moment of hope over fear.” He has called the coronavirus “the Chinese flu”, and he has supported anti-mask rhetoric in statements made after he officially began his position on July 1, which is at odds with official university policies 
Some feel that even without his divisive rhetoric, Grenell’s record is questionable. He has been criticized for saying he wanted to “empower” Germany’s conservative movement while serving as the US ambassador to Germany, and he has strained relations with German diplomats. Grenell has been accused of failing to disclose payments he received from Vladimir Plahotniuc, a Moldovan oligarch accused of corruption by the United States. Grenell was also paid for consulting work at the Magyar Foundation, a U.S. nonprofit funded mostly by the Hungarian government, without having registered the work under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. 
Another point of contention for those against his appointment was that Grenell was hired after Carnegie Mellon implemented a hiring freeze.
In the weeks that followed, multiple petitions to rescind Grenell’s appointment made the rounds, including a faculty-led open letter with 325 faculty signatories and a student-led petition with 1505 signatures. In response to the calls to rescind Grenell’s hiring Director of IPS Kiron Skinner released a statement defending the department’s decision. 
In the statement, Skinner said that the “Institute for Politics and Strategy is fully committed to intellectual diversity, which is the hallmark of the Academy” and that “as the nation’s first openly gay member of a president’s cabinet, a political conservative, a Christian, and a ten-year veteran of the State Department, Ambassador Grenell brings a unique perspective to the practice of US diplomacy and politics.”
Following Skinner’s statement, Carnegie Mellon President Farnam Jahanian released a statement backing the department’s decision, stating that “as an academic community that values the free exchange of ideas, we respect the variety of viewpoints expressed by members of the community on this matter.” 
President Jahanian also announced the formation of a special committee to review whether the appointment was consistent with university practice. The committee’s report was made available in a campus-wide email from Jahanian on Aug. 20. 
In an interview with The Tartan, Skinner elaborated on the department’s decision to hire Grenell. She clarified that Grenell would not be in a teaching position. Rather, he would engage the campus community on “intellectual and policy projects” focusing on the emergence of a “New Europe” and the decriminalization of homosexuality worldwide through campus forums and seminars. 
Skinner told The Tartan that it is standard to bring former government officials into academia, citing the Kennedy School’s appointment of Sean Spicer and Corey Lewandowski as fellows. “We’ve always had political figures and former officials on campus. This will be no different,” she said. 
Skinner says she “hired [Grenell] not for his viewpoint but for his background.” She said that “his viewpoints would contribute to the diversity of thought” at Carnegie Mellon, opining that intellectual diversity is “where American academia is overall weakest.” She also emphasized that Grenell will be required to abandon his political views when he comes to campus. 
In response to the controversy that surrounded Grenell’s appointment at IPS, Skinner stated “people who are writing petitions and letters and signing them are not coming to me to have a conversation to get a download on the facts about how and why I hired [Grenell].” 
“There needs to be exhaustive research on the individual and what is being claimed about them and then we can return to our first amendment conversation,” she said. 
Skinner added that it would be irresponsible for her to be the go-between for students and Grenell, saying she is “encouraging students to talk with Grenell themselves.” The Tartan requested comment from Grenell through IPS, but Grenell declined to comment.
In the faculty open letter opposing the hiring, the signatories disagreed with the administration’s use of the term academic freedom, stating “academic freedom does not in fact comprise an individual right to make appointments in a university, and it certainly does not remove the obligation to properly vet candidates for faculty positions (including visiting faculty) to ensure that they meet our university standards.”
Paul Eiss, an associate professor of history and one of the signatories of the letter, said the mischaracterization and misapplication of academic freedom “threw fuel on the fire” and was part of the reason many faculty signed the open letter. 
“When you fundamentally mischaracterize that freedom, you weaken that freedom,” Eiss said. 
He stated that academic freedom has three main applications: teaching, having the freedom to publish and research without reprisal, and inviting speakers. He emphasized that appointments do not fall under any of these categories. 
“It is a profound misuse of the term to use it, in effect, to say ‘you can’t question this, you can’t look at it.’ Not only are you misusing academic freedom for the purpose of preventing transparency, which is exactly what it’s not supposed to be used for, but in the process, you introduce a great deal of confusion into the campus community about what academic freedom is,” said Eiss.
Later, a separate open letter was published with 11 signatories, of whom only two are tenured faculty, titled “Defending Academic Freedom and Intellectual Diversity at CMU”, which lauded the administration’s decision to allow Grenell to stay. 
The letter reads, “Those demanding the appointment be rescinded are trying to redefine the meaning of ‘academic freedom’ to curtail this right, an action which would be extremely detrimental to the university. Furthermore, rescinding this appointment would create a chilling environment with respect to differences of opinion.”
Professor David Touretzky, a research professor of computer science and one of the co-authors of the letter supporting the administration’s decision, elaborated that the appointments should be the responsibility of the person in charge of hiring, rather than it being a group decision. 
Touretzky told The Tartan, “if it’s a group decision, then you’re forced to the lowest common denominator, the least controversial people that everybody can agree on. What you really want is for someone to be interesting enough that at least one person whose judgement you respect thinks they’re worth having on campus.” 
In response to the criticism that Grenell’s opponents have raised of his record, Touretzky found it to be “irrelevant” in the discussion about what Grenell could contribute to the campus discourse since they involve “political and professional decisions” made by Grenell. 
He further adds that “the real dishonesty” is coming from Grenell’s opponents. He cites a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article that included a tweet from Jeff Bigham, an associate professor in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute. The tweet states that “people who propped up Trump, helped to execute his agenda, should not be welcome to CMU.” 
“That’s what this is about,” he said. “Anyone who remains a Trump supporter should not be welcome on the CMU campus. That is what is really motivating them.” 
Touretzky added, “it’s the job of the adults to run the institution. Students don’t get to throw people off campus because they lose a popularity vote.” 
However, in wake of the controversy, Skinner reaffirmed her “serious commitment to the students in IPS,” which included starting a student advisory committee so the department can “include their perspectives and ideas.” 
The IPS department also held a virtual town hall on July 10 to directly communicate her decision with students. In the town hall, Skinner gave a timeline for Grenell’s hiring process. She discussed how Grenell had called her sometime after Carnegie Mellon’s hiring freeze to discuss a new book he was working on, as well as a project on the decriminalization of homosexuality. There was no search for a senior fellow position at the time. 
Skinner told students that she hired Grenell with a pot of money she received from donors to the department that was not affiliated with the university’s funds. She used this same money to invite past speakers such as Laura Chinchilla, the former president of Costa Rica, as well as Howard Dean. 
Mark Dempsey, a Class of 2020 alumni who attended the virtual IPS town hall, still felt skeptical about the hiring. Dempsey told The Tartan that “a charitable reading of Grenell’s hiring was that it is hubris and an uncharitable reading of it would be that it’s corrupt.” 
Later statements from President Jahanian, as well as the committee review report on Grenell’s hiring, confirmed Skinner’s statements about the funding sources and showed that Skinner had followed the proper protocol to get approval for the hiring process. In addition, she had received approval from Deans Schienes, Hebert, and Sanders, as well as Provost Garrett. 
In the midst of the debate over Grenell’s hiring, student activists have felt that their concerns about Grenell’s record have been misrepresented, and that the conversation had become too centered around the debate of academic freedom and partisan politics. 
Liam O’Connell, a junior in IPS, said that “people’s concerns are about Grenell’s record and reputation, not his ideology. I don’t think there has been much of a conversation about the issues that have been brought up.” 
O’Connell hoped that the conversation over the hiring could shift away from “liberals versus conservatives.” He stated that debate and “diversity of opinion” are good, but if the debate is “lies and misinformation, then I don’t see how it’s useful.”
“I don’t see how any academic institution, let alone one that talks about our prestige, would benefit.”
He also added that Grenell is a “US government alum whose focus is national security”, which is “not a new perspective that is being brought into IPS.” 
Catherine Taipe, a junior in IPS and one of the co-authors of the student-led petition, told The Tartan that “this is not an issue of whether or not he’s affiliated with the Trump administration or even being in far-right groups. It’s that he got so many complaints about his performance and wasn’t found to be competent at his job.” 
She added that “his Twitter account promotes harmful rhetoric, which is far different than having an opposing view.” 
Taipe also expressed her disappointment with the university’s mischaracterization of diversity, stating that “I don’t care about his identity or his background, but rather that he is a corrupt person.”
“The co-opting of the term ‘diversity’ to mean the embracing of racist and dangerous rhetoric in institutions of higher education is the most shameless, disgusting phenomenon that has come out of 21st-century performative and corporate wokeness. The goal of diversity, equity and inclusion is to uplift and empower the most marginalized voices –– and the way our university has twisted this goal in its favor is telling of its true values,” Taipe told The Tartan.
Taipe’s disappointment ventured beyond the university’s response to Mr Grenell’s hiring. 
“Carnegie Mellon University so badly wants to exist in this moral gray area for the sake of ‘diversity of thought’ that it ignores the active harm it is doing to its community members. This appointment is a slap in the face as a woman of color, as an IPS student, as a person who genuinely cares about the wellbeing of my classmates who are equally as disappointed,” Taipe said. 
As the semester begins, Grenell has continued to cause controversy among the student body. His tweet supporting anti-mask rhetoric was made on Aug. 20, the same day the committee report overseeing his hiring was made available by President Jahanian. 
That committee report states that Grenell will be expected to follow university policies and that it will “be incumbent on Prof. Skinner to make sure he understands this requirement and holds him accountable.” 
However, Taipe sees the university’s promise of accountability differently. “CMU has a lot of platitudes about creating a diverse, enriching, and equitable environment, but the actions they take don’t show it.... I just don’t really trust CMU’s promise on keeping Grenell accountable.”

A new COVID-19 testing facility has opened on Carnegie Mellon’s campus, the latest effort in a series of plans and protocols to limit the spread of COVID-19 as the university reopens for the fall semester. 
The outdoor facility is housed under the covered walkway alongside the Purnell Center for the Arts, and it runs almost the entire length of the building. Informative lawn signs flank the facility’s Forbes Avenue-facing entrance, reading “COVID-19 testing here,” “Face coverings are mandatory at all time,” and “Please remember to physically distance.” The facility is staffed by University Health Services (UHS) employees, who will administer PCR tests to the campus community that are sent to national labs for processing. 
Since Aug. 19, this facility has been processing tests from asymptomatic arrivals to campus, including all students moving into residence halls. This strategy was, as of Aug. 18, the only widespread testing the university planned to do, but as explained in an Aug. 28 communication, a new strategy expands asymptomatic testing to all undergraduate and graduate students, albeit not through this new facility. 
Starting this week, all asymptomatic Carnegie Mellon students in the Pittsburgh area will be “invited to schedule an appointment to pick up their FDA-approved at-home saliva test kit,” Gina Casalegno, VP for Student Affairs and Dean of Students, told The Tartan in a written statement. Results for these kits, which are being tested at a national lab, will be back in 3 to 5 business days. 
The university’s current plan to test a sample of around 1000 asymptomatic students per week will be carried out through this new Purnell pop-up facility. According to Casalegno, the university is also considering “the possibility of a surveillance strategy using an on-campus lab to administer and process saliva-based tests for all community members on a regular and ongoing basis” in addition to existing measures. 
The testing process for symptomatic individuals is different and will not be handled at the new facility. Tests for those with COVID-19 symptoms will be given at the UHS clinic and will involve two separate tests: an antigen test and a PCR test. The antigen test, given first, returns results in about 15 minutes. If a symptomatic student gets a negative result from the antigen test, a confirmatory PCR test is given. Right now, results for these confirmatory tests are coming back in 1 to 2 days, according to Casalegno. Those with symptoms of COVID-19, or those who have had close contact with someone who has tested positive, should follow the steps laid out by the university. 
The data that comes from this expanded testing strategy will be posted to the university’s COVID-19 dashboard with updates every Tuesday.

On the morning of Aug. 31, a widely circulated photo of The Fence on campus sparked outrage among the student body. The Fence, which had been previously painted to say “Black Lives Matter” was defaced to read “All Lives Matter."  “Black" had been crossed out in yellow paint.
According to The Fence rules, anyone who paints it must stand guard around the clock to prevent repainting, and if anyone is to paint the fence, they must paint it in its entirety. The defacing on Monday violated the rules, which means that it is an act of vandalism.
Following the incident, an email from Provost Jim Garrett and Vice President for Student Affairs Gina Casalegno went out to the campus: “The rules governing the Fence are upheld by members of the student body. As such, the university does not typically manage the Fence, or interfere with its content. This is not the first controversial message displayed on the Fence, and we are proud that our students have managed this situation in keeping with Carnegie Mellon’s culture and values.”
The email also added at the end “CMU believes and unequivocally affirms that Black Lives Matter.”
On the morning after the vandalism, The Fence was repainted swiftly by students, and on Monday night, dozens of students showed up to guard it. The Tartan reached out to some students who had gone back to repaint the fence, as well as some who stayed into the night to guard it. They all expressed their shock and disappointment at what had happened.
Ebi Indiamaowei, a freshman computer science major who helped repaint The Fence, explained how he was “holding his breath,” expecting something to happen to the Black Lives Matter message painted on the fence. Then it did.
“It was in the back of my head that I wouldn’t be surprised if someone did something to [The Fence], but the longer it was up there the more I was surprised. So when it happened on my first day, I felt really disappointed,” Indiamaowei told The Tartan.
Sheldon Yawson, a Dietrich College sophomore and a resident assistant at Stever who also helped repaint The Fence, echoed those sentiments, and added the effect it had on her.
“When I first saw it, it confirmed what I knew was already true,” Yawson said, “the microaggressions against Black students, the idea you don’t belong on campus because of the color of your skin.” 
Melina Castillo, a freshman ECE major, said she didn’t expect such an overt act of “bias and discrimination” on campus. She also added that “with painting the fence, it wasn’t just one person. It was probably a group. I fear that I walk by these people every day not knowing who they are.”  
During the night, students also put up 107 Black Lives Matter signs around campus, including one sign that read “why is it on us and not the administration?” A number of other signs read “Poor Black Lives Matter,” “Black Engineers Matter,” and “Black Fathers Matter.” The rest carried similar messages.
Students also spoke strongly of their disappointment at the administration’s emailed response.
Twain Byrnes, a CIT first-year, told The Tartan they would “be staying all night to guard the fence and possibly into the future until CMU creates some sort of solid response to this incident with an actual action plan.” Many students who were there also expressed their disappointment and anger at what they considered a “lackluster response.”
Yawson felt the response was a cop out.
“They basically sat around all morning and thought 'What’s the easiest thing we can do that people don’t blame us fully, but so that we don’t have to do the work to prove that Black lives matter on campus,'” she said.
Yawson also added, “when I first came to campus, I was under the assumption that if you violated the fence rules then there would be significant punishment, but now the fence rules are broken for hate speech and for a hate crime, and their response was just ‘Well some people repainted the fence and yeah Black lives matter,’ which is how it read to me”
Indiamaowei felt his perception of the school had been changed after their response.
“If the kids had put a swastika on it, there would be no issue, the consequences would have been swift and immediate and there wouldn’t even be a conversation about it. That’s the kind of energy I was hoping the school would have, and when there wasn’t, I was really disappointed.”
The student discourse has been largely rife with calls for the university to take action to attempt to find the perpetrators responsible.
Yawson pointed out, “CMU can’t have it both ways. If CMU can’t go after the person who broke the fence rules, and that’s ok by CMU standards, then why have the rules in the first place?”
Indiamaowei felt that Carnegie Mellon should do more to investigate “a hate crime,” adding that “saying something like Black Lives Matter isn’t something they should just say, they have to earn it. Even if they get flack in the news for ‘being too liberal,’ the university should actually enforce its ideals and put their money where their mouth is.” 
The Tartan reached out to the Carnegie Mellon police department for comment, and a spokesman from the university responded, saying “CMU Police does not anticipate any action because there are no security cameras on the Fence, and in the absence of a witness coming forward, there is no avenue of inquiry to pursue at this time.”
After the publishing of this article, an email went out to the campus from President Jahanian which addressed the incident and announced an investigation into it. At this time, it is our understanding that Carnegie Mellon Police still have" no avenue of inquiry." The headline has been update to reflect the situation.

As a queer Tartan alumnus, I welcome efforts by Carnegie Mellon to fight homophobia abroad. Homosexuality is a criminal offense in 72 countries across the globe - and punishable by death in 12. However, I don’t understand what it is that Former Ambassador Richard Grenell has to bring to these conversations that explain his appointment as a Senior Fellow of Carnegie Mellon’s Institute of Politics. 
It is fundamentally unclear what Grenell (or any member of the Trump administration) has to say in this area given the Trump administration’s abysmal record on LGBTQ+ rights.  Last year, when Grenell announced a campaign at the United Nations to decriminalize homosexuality, President Trump was surprised by the announcement. This policy also represented a continuation of 2011 Obama-era priorities. The Trump administration has attacked LGBTQ+ rights abroad in ways both big and small, by making it harder for queer people to receive asylum and adopt, giving pride of place to homophobic missionaries in sub-Saharan Africa, and bans on flying the rainbow flag at embassies where local politicians are actively attacking members of my community. The domestic policies of this administration are no better. They removed protections for queer federal contractors. They filed briefs to support employment discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in the cases decided by the Supreme Court this summer. They banned transgender Americans from serving in the military. They adopted Health and Human Services regulations that equate gender with sex assigned at birth.   
While it is unclear what benefit Mr. Grenell brings to Carnegie Mellon, it is very clear what benefits Mr. Grenell gets from Carnegie Mellon. He gets his reputation, tarnished by service in this administration, laundered. This action hurts all of us in the Carnegie Mellon community – as all of us will have that Carnegie Mellon name on our resume. A name now also associated with Richard Grenell.
Finally, as the President of the Graduate Student Assembly and member of the Student Government Executive Board for the 2016-2017 school year, this feels like a betrayal by President (then Provost) Jahanian and the Carnegie Mellon academic administration. When you met with me and my constituents after the 2016 election you expressed your commitment to diversity and inclusion. Those values now ring hollow. We worked together to make this a campus that welcomed everyone, for instance when you (President Jahanian) and I worked together with the Iranian Student Association after the first visa ban. These actions don’t mean much now    
This decision to bring Richard Grenell on undercuts all of the work done over the past four years by showing that the Carnegie Mellon administration will commit an unforced error. That it will go for the glitz of a big, morally questionable hire - and sacrifice itself in the process.

I’ve been hesitant to write about the recent hiring of Richard Grenell when the furor over his hiring really is not, as The Post-Gazette put it, “a unique drama.” As our President put it in one of the numerous responses to the university community, this is an issue that many campuses have faced before. Far from being a unique issue, the hiring of Grenell is a petty squabble among professionals, some of whom act like spoiled, irascible children and others like the parents who continually accommodate their tantrums.
It’s a dispute between and about professionals and professionalism, one that pales in comparison to the number of existential issues ongoing in our country. Two hurricanes bear down on the Gulf Coast, and previous hurricane disaster mismanagement has led to thousands of deaths. Wildfires continue to rage in California and the American West, leading to deadly smog in Denver. White vigilantism has killed two in Kenosha, and it has led to nooses, hung to intimidate, and lynchings across the United States. With the pandemic response mismanaged at every level of government, the COVID-19 death toll is closing in on 200,000 dead.
And we’re still debating whether or not Richard Grenell should be hired? The man who has committed to an anti-mask policy when masks are shown to be one of the most effective ways to slow the spread of the virus? The man who has continually dismissed protesters as violent, without recognizing that it’s the protesters who have been killed? The man who quips about “professional journalism” for cheap political points instead of focusing on the ongoing disasters? And we are still debating Grenell’s hiring!
The impotence shown by the deans and administrators in accepting this debate —  as President Jahanian said, “I am confident that our community will be able to work through them civilly and with rigorous debate” — is galling. They have all chosen to go to bat for their professional values of academic freedom, but when multiple opportunities to demonstrate basic moral competency cross the plate, they choose to let them go by.
What exactly does it mean to you to hire Richard Grenell, President Jahanian? Provost Garrett? All the others involved in his hiring? 
To me, it means that you chose to accept a debate of academic freedom and professionalism when Carnegie Mellon students are struggling to pay for food and rent. I’m sure it is quite the balancing act to run a university, especially one with such vast commitments to militant and police violence in the U.S., but is there not a shred of empathy for the students who go to your college who are dealing with these disasters? Surely, you all do have some capacity for empathy. You are all still human.
It just seems that your professional commitment to free speech is stronger than your moral commitments to your students. To prevent your students from going hungry, to prevent them from going homeless, to prevent them from losing their livelihoods and even their lives, takes a strong moral commitment. To accept the hiring of Grenell takes no strength, no commitment to foundational values like feeding the hungry or housing the homeless, and today, when millions could be evicted and lines extend miles at food banks, we have to act on our foundational values.
To President Jahanian, et al., stop acting like you have made a morally strong decision. Do something good.

Carnegie Mellon is not known for its stellar reputation as a liberal arts school. Judging by how things have been going recently in student government, this reality is unlikely to change anytime soon. Many have discouraged me from writing this letter — not because they thought that its content is not worth disseminating to a broader audience, but rather because they believe the issues I raise will be met with nothing but an uninterested shrug from members of our campus community.
On June 12, at the behest of the Dean of Students, student government leaders (president, vice president, senate chair and GSA president, in coordination with the Student Body Vice President for Finance) issued a recommendation to the Board of Trustees to lower the activities fee for the upcoming fall semester by approximately 20% for graduate students and 25% for undergraduate students. They did so in clear violation of both the letter and the spirit of our governing documents because neither of their respective legislative bodies was given a chance to vote on this suggested decrease, and — arguably even worse — neither body was even informed of this unprecedented action (GSA reps were only told in August). 
While there may be solid majorities in both bodies for a reduction of the fee, the action our leaders took while being pressured to act quickly by Dean Casalegno were fundamentally undemocratic in nature, because they broke with one of the core tenets of democratic systems, the “power of the purse”, which establishes checks and balances in government. Because the quota by which fees are allocated to branches of student government is fixed, this reduction also led to proportional reductions of the budgets of student senate, GSA-main and every departmental GSA budget, budgets which are usually passed with legislative majorities, or in the case of the departments, the executive committee has zero discretion over.
That our leaders have taken so rash a decision is also unfortunate because we are in the midst of a pandemic. Stopgap measures have delayed a severe economic shock for now, but eviction moratoria are set to expire soon. Many students in Pittsburgh are also at risk of being affected, even if they themselves are solvent enough to continue to pay rent. Our campus, too, is undergoing significant changes. It is in times like these where we need strong leadership in student government to fight for causes near and dear to our interests, and to ensure that all the new measures implemented in response to this crisis are as equitable as possible. We have witnessed an onslaught of new demands of our leaders, and the hours clocked in committee meetings ranging from efforts on diversity, equity and inclusion to new ground rules for campus life have have risen to unhealthy levels and there is a real risk that some of them will burn out before the semester even truly starts.
In this environment, having well-funded discretionary budgets to support these activities seems vital, if only to provide food and refreshments for grueling meetings. What’s more, the uncertainty inherent in a semester unlike any we have witnessed before should make us cautious about what the fiscal demands are for the upcoming year, so prematurely defunding these activities seems incredibly myopic, especially as tuition and other cost components remain unchanged. Evidently, many social events that government leaders have planned will not be feasible, but that does not mean that funds cannot be reallocated to activities that are more pressing at the time. Many of these considerations should’ve given our student government leaders pause, led them to consult with their legislative bodies and experts, and potentially search for a solution where unspent funds can be returned after the year is over. Instead, they took matters into their own hands and resorted to fiscal cannibalism.
