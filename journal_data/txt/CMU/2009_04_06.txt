Rounding out the two day Mid-Atlantic Regional with 614 (306–308) points, the Carnegie Mellon golf team took home its first ever regional invitational. Besting 14 other collegiate squads at the Hershey Country Club this past Sunday and Monday, the Tartans are well on their way to close out the spring season in the same fashion as the fall — dominating play and coming out with another championship title.
"The tournament we won this weekend was the biggest one we have ever won!" said senior Alex Timmons. "The team really pulled together and I am proud of everyone."
Despite a draw of 614 total points with Washington & Jefferson, the Tartans broke the tiebreaker with the fifth man's score on day two. This same result occurred the week before at the McDaniel Invitational, in which the Tartans tied Susquehanna University but ultimately won the tournament with first-year Terence Einhorn's tie-breaking score that put Carnegie Mellon up and in the lead.
The close victory excited the Carnegie Mellon squad as they prepared for the Titan Spring Invitational scheduled for last Monday. However, due to unplayable weather conditions, the tournament was postponed. The week of rest and training gave the Tartans a leg up on their competition as they entered the Mid-Atlantic Invitational and ultimately took home the title.
Following Carnegie Mellon and W&J came Allegheny University with 623, McDaniel University with 632, and Rochester University with 633.
Leading the Tartans, junior Christopher Lee tallied 158 (78–75) to tie for seventh overall. Trailing behind Lee, two Tartans gathered a 10th-place tie of 154 points total with senior Joshua Chen carding 78–76 and first-year Michael Cheng carding 74–80.
To round out the Tartans' competition, Timmons recorded an 80 on Monday after finishing Sunday with a 76. Einhorn shot a two-day total of 158 (81–77).
"I really feel that a lot of our success stems from the internal competition on the team," Timmons said.
The Tartans play host Thursday, April 9, for the Carnegie Mellon Invitational held at Longue Vue Country Club, with tee time scheduled for 10 a.m.

"Carnegie Mellon Rugby Football club steps on the field every game seen as pushovers and walks off the field earning the respect of the opposition and usually a win," head coach John Elash said.
Week after week, the Cardinal and Gray racked up victories against top regional teams, ultimately leading the Carnegie Mellon Rugby club to a 5–1 record overall in the fall and remaining undefeated in its playoff bracket.
As a result of the team's success, four Carnegie Mellon players, with a fifth alternate, have been selected for the Allegheny Rugby Union (ARU) Select Side. Fifth-year Jameson O'Donnell, junior Daniel Huddock, senior Mario Pedro Leonel, and graduate student Tim Lee will represent the Tartans, who make up just under 20 percent of the overall select squad that will compete in the Midwest Tournament. The invitational will be held at the end of the month in Grand Rapids, Mich. In addition to these six honors, the team's only female player was selected for the ARU Women's U-23 select side.
For the second time in four years, the team has taken home the trophy at the Coopers Lake Collegiate Plate Classic in which the Tartans recorded decisive wins over their three opponents on the weekend, defeating sides from Washington & Jefferson (15–7), Kenyon College (24–0), and Juniata College (18–3).
Starting the tournament with a struggle against W&J, Carnegie Mellon did not demonstrate its truth worth on the field right away but rallied in the next game to prove its dominance. Amped up and ready to go, the Tartans brought aggression and technique to the forefront, outplaying Juniata in the final match of the weekend.
With this exciting win, the Tartans entered this past weekend with high expectations and relentless game strategies that ultimately led to the Carnegie Mellon 27–7 victory over West Virginia University. Despite the close match-up, the Tartans were able to pull ahead, maintaining possession and locking in the defense. After a 20-yard sprint down the sideline, senior Frank Marzano recorded his first try for the Tartans and received Man of the Match honors. Marzano helped seal the win for Carnegie Mellon.
"This team has respectfully represented Carnegie Mellon all the while becoming a team that strikes fear into its opponent," Elash said. "We also know this is only the beginning of a great rugby tradition at Carnegie Mellon University."
The team will face Robert Morris University, and possibly University of Pittsburgh, this Saturday at Gesling Stadium.

The 14th ranked Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team had a change of schedule this week, taking a break from the usual dual matches against Division III opponents to win 4–3 against local Division I Duquesne University. The Tartans now stand at 13–5 for the season.
“We knew we would have our hands full with a Division I opponent. This team has beaten us many years in a row, and they are pretty banged up with injuries, so we knew we had a good chance. Our doubles [play] is getting better every match, and we really dominated start to finish on all three courts,” junior Jon Spero said. “In singles, we were a little shaky, but we got the job done. [Junior Ravi Raghavan] hasn’t played a lot of singles this year, so he isn’t very match tough, but he did a great job closing out two close sets to clinch the match for us.”
Although the Tartans played with official Division I scoring, in which all of the doubles matches count as a single point instead of three, they started off strong and swept all three doubles matches. The first doubles duo of Spero and sophomore Bobby MacTaggart dominated their opponents 8–3. Then the second doubles team of Raghavan and sophomore Alex Nemerov won 8–6, followed by a win from juniors James Muliawan and Nikola Ljuboja at third doubles, 8–5, to conclude the doubles competition with a Tartans sweep.
The victories did not just stop at doubles, and the Tartans were able to pull out three more singles wins to secure the match. Senior Yiran Liu nabbed the second point at fifth singles, steamrolling his opponent 6–1, 6–1. Adding to the total next was Nemerov at second singles, who snatched up a 6–4, 6–2 win, followed by Raghavan, who clinched the match at six singles, 7–5, 7–6 (7–5).
“This was a pretty exciting win for us, “ said Liu. “Since this was our last home match, it was nice to finish with a win against a good Division I team. I think this match is good preparation for the tournament coming up in a few weeks.”
The Tartans have a short break before they resume play in two weeks and try to defend their title at the Great Lakes Colleges Association tournament held in Crawfordsville, Ind.

Of all the complicated lessons Carnegie Mellon students learn in the classroom, there is one topic that is least talked about yet even more important than the others. It is bigger than any test, than any job interview across the nation, than any booth or buggy or formal. It lies within you; your health is the one and only decision-making process that stays with you from birth, and your body will benefit or suffer from these decisions.
It is a common belief that in order to be healthy, one must be perfect. However, nobody is perfect, so why bother? Our students should know this is faulty reasoning. Being “healthy” is not being a marathon runner or eating carrots and bran cereal at every meal. Being healthy simply takes just one step. And there is a multitude of tiny, easy actions that you can take anywhere to improve your well-being and add years to your life.
Take something as little as smiling for example. Every time you smile, you are helping your body. It sounds corny, but it’s science. Studentclinc.com cites numerous research studies done on smiling. The studies done on college students proved “smilers” to be perceived as more optimistic, reliable, and better leaders than their counterparts.
Psychologist Robert Zajonc is well-known for his studies on smiling. He finds that smiling cools down the blood in your face and releases serotonin, the neurotransmitter responsible for our moods, sleep, sexuality, and appetite.
ABC News discusses a research paper done at Carnegie Mellon showing that people are healthy because they are happy and happy because they are healthy; a cyclical system. Take it even further, and laugh. Helpguide.org finds that “laughter activates the chemistry of the will to live and increases our capacity to fight disease.... It reduces problems associated with high blood pressure, strokes, arthritis, and ulcers [and] may also reduce the risk of heart disease.”
It has also been proven that smiling and laughing both stimulate others around you and cause their bodies to naturally mimic yours, making your smile or laugh contagious. So if improving our health is as easy as upturning our lips, why do some people think being healthy is so hard?
Slow down, Carnegie Mellon. Too many students here get so wrapped up in their classes and extracurricular activities that they lose sight of what is most important: themselves. For just one day, look up when you walk to class. Stop text messaging or worrying about exams. The best thing you can do right now is to be conscious of your body and your surroundings.
Go on a walk or kick a soccer ball around with your friends — just feel your body moving. Exercise is a double plus because of the rush of endorphins your brain gets (find out why next week). If you just take time to breathe and take a look at what’s around you, you may end up with a huge smile on your face. Your body will thank you later.

As a member of the Carnegie Mellon golf team, first-year Michael Cheng has been a top performer in his rookie year, ranking in the upper echelon of competitors as he focuses on tuning his collegiate golf game. The Tartans recently were victorious, in earning first place at the McDaniel Invitational in Abbottstown, Pa., in which Cheng garnered a fifth place overall finish.
Cheng’s success so far at Carnegie Mellon is a continuation of his success in high school at Syosset, where he was a member of the varsity golf team for all four years and was also selected for the all-state squad during his final three years. With a handful of chances for competition this season before the opportunity to contend in the University Athletic Association (UAA) golf tournament at the end of April, Cheng can look to further improve his golf game before this year concludes. The Tartan golf team consists of strong leadership, especially from seniors Alex Timmons, a three-time UAA honoree in this season alone, and Joshua Chen, whom Cheng and the other members of the team can learn from while angling to make progress in their own careers in the sport.
Being a member of a varsity team at Carnegie Mellon has allowed Cheng to validate his excitement of meeting new people and developing great friendships upon entering his first year. Cheng has developed similar habits and interests to most college students in Pittsburgh, such as enjoying meals at his favorite off-campus eatery — Lulu’s on Craig Street — for its quality food at economical prices.
A native of Woodbury, N.Y., Cheng sees himself returning to his native state post-graduation, pursuing a career with his intended degree in economics. Cheng admits that golf will always be a prominent part of his life and will be useful as a leisure and networking activity in the years to come.
Holding Tiger Woods as his professional idol, Cheng is a tenacious and hardworking student athlete and said, “[Woods’] focus and determination on the golf course is what I strive to have.”
In his first year at the university, Cheng has already shown much focus and determination as he successfully balances academics and collegiate athletes. If he wasn’t playing golf, Cheng would most like to try his hand at tennis “because of its fast pace and the high amount of endurance that is needed to perform well.” Besides these two sports, Cheng also loves to snowboard and takes advantage of the long winter months in this region that make the sport most enjoyable.
The Carnegie Mellon golf team won its second straight Eastern College Athletic Conference South Championship this past fall, and with the combination of strong performances from underclassmen and the tradition of high achievement, the program can look to be a front runner in next year’s tournaments as well. Up next for the Tartans is the Carnegie Mellon Invitational at their home course at Longvue Country Club this Thursday.

”Line drive and a base hit! Justice has scored the tying run, Bream to the plate, and he is... safe! Safe at the plate! The Braves go to the World Series!” — Sean McDonough, Oct. 14, 1992, Game 7 of the NLCS.
Many Pirates fans remember this moment as the last time their team was any good. Braves first baseman Sid Bream, who fans still believe should have been out on the play, slid home safely under Pittsburgh catcher Mike LaValliere’s tag to send the Braves to a 3–2 victory and the World Series. Atlanta would go on to lose the Series to the Toronto Blue Jays, but made up for it by winning it in 1995 and winning the division title for 14 straight seasons, from 1991 to 2005. They also went to the World Series twice more, in 1996 and 1998, losing to the Yankees both times.
The Pirates, on the other hand, took a slightly different trail after their crushing defeat. The excitment of 1992 was followed up by a losing season in 1993 and, after a strike-shortened 1994, losing seasons in 1995, 1996, 1997, one-two-skip-a-few, 2007, and 2008. Personnel changes going into the 2008 season brought hope that maybe, just maybe, the Pirates would put together some semblance of Major League respectability, but fans were once again let down by another last-place finish. Don’t hold your breath, folks — the losing won’t stop here.
Today, at 4:15 p.m., the Pirates will begin the 2009 season in St. Louis. The Cardinals’ Adam Wainwright will oppose the Pirates’ best starting pitcher from 2008, Paul Maholm. To put “best starting pitcher” into perspective, Maholm went 9–9 last year. The team didn’t make any noteworthy acquisitions this off-season, but they did do the predictable Pirates thing by letting many key bench players go, like Doug Mientkiewicz and Jason Michaels, for fear that they would ask for — gasp! — too much money.
The Pirates also surprised no one with their stinginess in negotiating contract extensions for their best offensive producers, Ryan Doumit and Nate McLouth. Negotiations with McLouth, hands down one of the best offensive players in the league last year, took an especially long time, as the Pirates apparently forgot that he played for $425,000 in 2008 and deserved a considerable upgrade.
But stinginess has been a trademark of the Pirates organization for years. Fans have been calling for principal owner Bob Nutting’s head for many years now. Nutting, though claiming to have a goal of building a championship team, has clearly settled for instead making halfhearted runs at .500 seasons year after year. The three-year deals for Doumit and McLouth provide hope that a young, talented core to build a winning franchise around is finally being established, but just wait until their three years are up. If they’ve produced up to expectations, their monetary yearnings will no doubt be out of the Pirates’ and Nutting’s miniscule range.
Acquiring outfielders Craig Monroe and Eric Hinske in the off-season put them in a slightly better position to win this year, but also effectively blocked their four other outfield prospects — Brandon Moss, Nyjer Morgan, Andrew McCutchen, and Steve Pearce — from being promoted to the big league to showcase their talents and develop into that talented youth core the Pirates so badly need. The Tampa Bay Rays put faith in their youth and it worked out wonderfully last year, as they went all the way to the World Series after 10 straight losing seasons; why the Pirates refuse to follow suit is beyond me.
As an avid baseball fan, my assessment that the Pirates stink is considerably more educated than the average layman’s assessment that the Pirates stink. So if you’re a Pirates fan, stop holding your breath. Grab a ticket to one of the many fireworks and/or bobblehead nights, grab a beverage and a hot dog, and brace yourself for yet another season of blown leads, runners left on base, and a whole lot of booing.

As technology aimed at improving our lives becomes more advanced and integrated into our routines, the way we utilize machines not only needs to be simple, but also easy to interact with. One category of machinery that has been the subject of increasing amounts of research is robotics.
Bilge Mutlu, a Carnegie Mellon Ph.D. candidate in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, has taken this research one step further to find ways in which humans can better interact with robots. 
Originally trained in product design in Turkey and the United States, Mutlu also has a master’s degree from Carnegie Mellon’s School of Design. 
His interest in robots stemmed from his desire to make appliances more intelligent, but he soon discovered the vast potential robots have to impact the society.
Mutlu works in collaboration with the world’s largest human-robot interaction lab — the Japan-based Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International (ATR). Mutlu also works with the chief researchers of ATR, Takayuki Kanda and Hiroshi Ishiguro. Together, the two teams have been trying to design social mechanisms for robots and sharing information. At last month’s Human-Robot Interaction Conference in San Diego, Calif., Mutlu, along with Kanda and Ishiguro, as well as other ATR scientists, won the “Best Paper Award” for their paper “Footing in Human-Robot Conversations: How Robots Might Shape Participant Roles Using Gaze Cues.”
Mutlu has conducted several experiments to test human perceptiveness to a robot, and has found that the more human-like the robot acts, the better the interaction from the subject; he states the subjects gain “social and cognitive benefits.”
“Robots have to serve as a central interface for other forms of technology around us and offer us a social interaction paradigm to interact with them, ” Mutlu noted. “[Robots can have] a significant impact in the real world through practical applications and through scientific exploration. My work focuses on robots that embody human physical, cognitive, and social capabilities.”
To experiment with how humans can become more attentive to robots, Mutlu and his colleagues ran several tests where the robots exhibited several human idiosyncrasies. In one test, several subjects were read a story by a robot.  After time, the subjets were tested for the number of details they remembered from the story. The more the robot glanced at the human, the better the recall was for details of the story from the subjects. 
In another test, the subject was seated across from a robot and a dozen different objects were placed between them. 
The robot mentally chose an object but did not move.
The subject’s job was to determine what object the robot had chosen by asking questions. 
The researchers found that when the robot made subtle eye glances to the object, it took fewer questions for the subjects to correctly guess the right object. 
When quizzed afterward about the eye glances, about 75 percent of the subjects responded that they did not even notice them. 
This  led Mutlu to hypothesize that the signals were subconsciously detected by the subjects.
Another interesting find was that humans generally performed better in experiments with Ishiguro’s human-like robot called Geminoid. Geminoid is an android with basic artificial intelligence capabilities programmed to act like a human.  
This natural reaction, Mutlu says, is an automatic response to social clues, a phenomenon psychologists call “mindlessness,” an occurrence in which humans carry out their normal routines without realizing what they are doing. 
“Robots have the potential to draw on this automatic propensity to evoke social responses from people,” he added.
Other robots that Mutlu and ATR have developed and worked with with include Honda’s ASIMO, a four-foot-tall robot that can carry out straightforward actions like flipping switches or using doorknobs, and ATR’s own Robovie, a robot that can respond to simple questions.
The newest robot Mutlu is working with is called Wakamaru, which, according to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, is an “independent personality ... designed to live with humans.” 
The ASIMO and Wakamaru robots currently reside at Carnegie Mellon, while Geminoid and Robovie are at ATR in Japan.
According to Kanda, early applications for Mutlu and ATR’s human-robot research could be creating robots that have entertainment functions or roles to physically assist people.
“So the primary goal is to establish basic communication capabilities of robots, which also needs some degree of understanding of humans about how they perceive anthropomorphized robots,” Kanda said. “It will give us various possibilities to use functions of robots. One metaphor could be a Windows system, which is to use many applications on a computer; in a robot, such general interface function will be needed, which I want to realize.”
Mutlu believes that his three overarching goals for the direction of the research are to: study more complex social behaviors in humans and design these behaviors for robots, use robots as research tools for experimental behavioral research, and develop robotic applications for the real world in such domains as education and autism therapy.

“Dear CMU Webmail Subscriber,
To complete your CMU Webmail account, you must reply to this email immediately and enter your password here.... Failure to do this....”
You may have received an e-mail like this once or twice, and it may have made you suspicious. But if you were busy or careless you might have fallen for it — and e-mailed back your password.
“Phishing” is the collection of techniques that take advantage of an unwary user’s belief that an e-mail, or other message, originated from a trusted source. 
The goal is typically to obtain computer account or financial information.“Spear-phishing,” in particular, is a highly targeted form of phishing that attempts to emulate the style and content of a specific authority.
Carnegie Mellon’s Information Security Office (ISO) attempts to continuously identify and confront threats to the campus computer network and its users. 
“In August of last year, more than 700 Carnegie Mellon accounts received the [spear-phishing] attacks,” said Mary Ann Blair, director of the ISO.
As Blair explained, although the ISO has offered training on how to avoid falling prey to phishing, there remains the issue that “there is no good way of measuring effectiveness of security training.” 
Without objective measures of different security training regimes, it is hard to improve the training. Blair added that the ISO’s willingness to work with security groups on campus means that “researchers have a ready-made laboratory ... to test interventions.”
In a collaboration begun with the ISO last fall, Lorrie Cranor, an associate professor of engineering and public policy and also director of the CyLab Usable Privacy and Security Laboratory (CUPS), and her student Ponnurangam Kumaraguru from the computation, organizations, and society Ph.D. program have recently concluded a campus-wide study on phishing prevention.
The study invited all Andrew account holders to volunteer and drew 515 participants, each of whom were placed in one of three separate groups. Over the course of 28 days, the researchers sent out 10 e-mails, seven of which were simulated spear-phishing messages. For the first group, one of the malicious e-mails led to a comic explaining the security risk of phishing and how to avoid becoming a victim. 
For the second group, the comic appeared twice. The final group had no training at all on how to avoid the phishing e-mails. The researchers found that more training was more effective, and that the knowledge gained from training was maintained after a month’s time. In addition, the training did not result in participants’ avoiding legitimate e-mails in fear of a phishing attempt.
“The kind of attacks that we used in this study were very realistic,” explained Cranor. “Any attacker who looked at a few CMU websites would have enough information to perpetrate these attacks.”
PhishGuru, the security training technology used in the study, is being commercialized by Wombat Security Technologies, Inc., a start-up co-founded by Cranor with Norman Sadeh, a professor of computer science, and Jason Hong, an assistant professor in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute.
The results from the study will be presented on Friday, April 10 from 1–2 p.m. in McConomy Auditorium.

College activists, street protesters, radical civilians, and perhaps perverted stalkers are all familiar with what tear gas is and what it does. 
Nowadays, tear gas is usually used by both police for crowd control and by individuals for personal protection. What exactly is tear gas? Moreover, how do you fabricate tear gas yourself at home?
“Tear gas” is a term commonly used to refer to a group of chemicals known as lachrymators, or riot control agents. 
Lachrymators stimulate the corneal nerves in the eyes to cause symptoms of tearing, pain, hard breathing, and even temporary blindness. 
They attack the sulphur containing compounds in enzymes and irritate the mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, mouth, and lungs. 
Some common lachrymatory agents are 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile (CS gas), phenacyl chloride (CN gas), and oleoresin capsicum (OC spray).
CN gas has been used for personal protection and defense since the 1920s. Phenacyl chloride is usually synthesized by the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene using chloroacetyl chloride, along with an aluminum chloride catalyst. 
Some of the first such products were tear gas pens and pistols . These gas pens and pistols were able to aim the CN particles at an individual and cause some serious damage. The use of such devices usually results in both mechanical and chemical injuries to the eye.
In 1965, CN was sold by General Ordinance and Equipment Company as a personal protection spray device. It was widely marketed under the brand name Mace. This product gained extreme popularity in the 1960s, and the term Mace is still incorrectly used as a generic term for all aerosol defense spray. 
Unfortunately, according to Howard Hu’s article “Tear Gas — Harrassing Agent or Toxic Chemical Weapon?” since the advent of the product, there have been reports indicating the product to have limited effectiveness against some individuals, notably people who are under the influence of drugs and alcohol, or those with certain mental disturbances. 
In addition, it can take from several seconds to a few minutes for CN to achieve its full effect, which makes the person using the spray vulnerable to attack during this period of time.
After CN gas, CS gas was first developed by the Chemical Defense Experimental Establishment in Portland, England in the 1950s. 
CS gas is synthesized by the reaction of 2-chlorobenzaldehyde and malononitrile via the Knoevenagel condensation, in which a hydrogen atom is added to the carbon atom in the compound, and a water molecule is removed. 
The reaction is catalyzed by a weak base, such as piperidine or pyridine. The catalyst helps the reaction proceed much faster than it would without the catalyst.
Its useful form is intended to be a smoke or fog of suspended particles. This can form a mist that is very harmful. Since its introduction, CS has predominantly replaced CN as the riot control agent of choice in England and the United States. 
It can cause extreme severe skin and mucous membrane irritation even in minute doses. The symptoms caused by CS are also exacerbated in hot or humid weather.
During the Vietnam War, the United States developed the “Mighty Mite,” which is a continuous spray device used in caves and tunnel systems. Although described as a non-lethal weapon, recent studies have shown otherwise. 
In his research article “Possible Lethal Effects of CS Tear Gas” Uwe Heinrich stated that under the circumstances in which gas masks are not used and occupants were trapped, “there is a distinct possibility that this kind of CS exposure can significantly contribute to or even cause lethal effects.” 
In addition, according to the United States Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine, CS gas emits “very toxic fumes” when heated to decomposition, and at specified concentrations, CS gas is an immediate danger to life and health. They also state that individuals exposed to CS gas should seek medical attention immediately.
OC spray, most widely known as pepper spray, is another commonly used tear gas nowadays. It is a much less lethal agent but can be deadly in  rare cases. 
The active ingredient in pepper spray is capsaicin, which is a chemical derived from the fruit of the plants in the Capsicum genus, including chilis. Pepper spray  has effects similar to those of other types of tear gas and can cause a stinging and painful sensation in the eyes. Pepper spray is currently one of the most effective personal protection devices available. 
For Carnegie Mellon students who constantly stay in the library until late at night and feel unsafe walking back to their residences, it may be helpful to carry a can of improvised homemade pepper spray that has similar effects. 
A step-by-step guide for  making tear gas at home:
According to InfoBarrel.com, all you need to make pepper spray are two tablespoons of hot red pepper powder, rubbing alcohol, baby oil, and an empty spray bottle. 
1.Put the red pepper powder in a small glass container. 
2.Pour rubbing alcohol until it is one centimeter above the pepper powder.  
3.Grind the pepper in the alcohol. A spoon or spatula could be used. 
4.Continue to grind and stir for at least 10 minutes.
5.Add half a centimeter of baby oil and mix for about two minutes; cover the glass container and shake until well mixed.
6.Try to avoid spilling while shaking the container.
7.To filter the solution, pour it into another container that has a piece of cloth over it. 
8.Lastly, put the solution into the spray bottle, clearly labeled to avoid accidents.

Zombies are one of the true representatives of the horror genre. Why zombies are so frightening is a matter of psychology — we feel uncomfortable around objects that feel familiar and foreign at the same time. They seem so human, yet they have an unsettlingly different anatomy.
Fortunately for the human race, zombies do not actually exist. However, a medical condition exists that causes people to think they have turned into zombies. This is a mental disorder called Cotard’s Syndrome, or Walking Corpse Syndrome. Discovered by French neurologist Jules Cotard, who had a patient with the condition, it was first described in 1880 as a syndrome that eventually made the patient deny their sense of self.
Symptoms of this mental disorder vary between individuals, but share the common trait of being bizarre. Sometimes, patients think they have died or lost their soul; other patients deny the existence of their body parts, from limbs to organs inside the body. Some patients think that they do not have blood. 
The inability to recognize the body is an extremely dangerous condition, as no care will be given to it.
According to an article on www.associatedcontent.com, one patient starved himself because he did not think he had a stomach. The original patient studied by Cotard started to think she did not have to eat, and believed she could never die naturally. Another article on www.healthdoc.info, describes a case in which another patient, in 1996, thought he died of either AIDS, yellow fever, or septicemia, a disease where pathogens are present in the blood stream. In addition, he thought his soul was taking a trip in hell, while his physical body was asleep elsewhere.
People are not born with disease, but rather acquire it through some mental illness or physical injury. Different parts of the brain control the way a person perceives the world, and when these parts are injured, perception can be altered. Walking Corpse Syndrome is thought to be related to depression, schizophrenia, and derealization, a condition in which the world, or one’s self, feels unreal. 
Head trauma, like in a case in which a motorcycle accident caused this disorder, can be the cause of an altered perception as well. Cortard’s Syndrome is also believed to be related to Capgras Syndrome, a disorder that causes one to believe a person, usually a family member or close friend, has been replaced by an impostor. 
According to www.psychnet-uk.com, Capgras Syndrome results when the brain does not consciously recognize faces. Similarly, Cortard’s Syndrome may result when a person sees his own face or body but is unable to recognize it as himself. Therefore, the brain perceives the individual as someone else, resulting in a belief that the true self is nonexistent. 
This disorder presents itself subconsciously — just as we know we are alive and recognize ourselves, people who suffer from this syndrome act as if they truly believe their body does not exist.
Because of the rarity of the disorder, effective treatment is not known. 
Antidepressant drugs do not seem to have much effect on individuals with the disorder. However, electroconvulsive therapy has been shown to be effective in certain cases, curing patients of the disorder. 
Electroconvulsive therapy involves inducing a seizure in a certain area of the brain, causing a person to lose consciousness and convulse for 15 seconds. 
The mechanisms of electroconvulsive therapy are still not known, but it has shown to be effective for treating many mental illnesses, including depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.
This disease is still mostly unheard of and not well-understood; treatments are still largely experimental. 
However, for the select few who are affected by this disorder, what we do know will help them live a normal life.

Study proves heart can grow new cells
When a person gets a cut or breaks a bone, these wounds can heal. However, damage to the heart has been thought to be irreparable for a very long time. This is because the heart was thought to be unable to grow new cells. A recent study conducted by Jonas Frisen of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm shows otherwise. The study concluded that about 1 percent of the heart muscles are replaced every 25 years and this number falls to less than 0.5 percent by age 75.
Cell turnover rates can be measured in animals by making their cells radioactive. Frisen realized that nuclear weapons increased levels of radioactive carbon-14 during above-ground testing until 1963. Therefore, the carbon-14 should be incorporated into the cells’ DNA forever. 
Because the isotope’s levels fall every year, the amount of carbon-14 in the DNA can indicate the cell’s birth date. Frisen used this new method to successfully assess the turnover rate of heart muscle cells.

Poor brushing may  cause heart attacks
Oelisoa Andriankaja and colleagues at the University at Buffalo in New York tested 386 people who had suffered heart attacks and 840 people without heart troubles, and showed that two types of bacteria, Tannerella forsynthesis and Prevotella intermedia, were more common among the heart attack patients.
This recent study aimed at searching for evidence linking oral hygiene with overall health (especially heart attacks). Andriankaja’s team also discovered that people who had the most bacteria in their mouths were most likely to have heart attacks. 
Doctors believe that bacteria in the mouth that causes gum disease could set off an inflammation that causes a blood clot in the heart, thereby leading to a heart attack.

Drug decreases blood clot risk
A study recently led by Paul Ridker of Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston shows that people who take statin drugs to lower cholesterol (such as Crestor, Litipor, and Zocor) can also cut the risk of developing dangerous blood clots that lodge in the legs or lungs. In the study, Crestor cut almost in half the risk of blood clots in those people with low cholesterol but high chances of inflammation.
A high sensitivity C-reactive protein CRP is used to measure inflammation­ — a common cause of clogged arteries.

Stem cells could aid deaf patients
Researchers at the University of Sheffield in the UK successfully created cells that behave like sensory hair cells or auditory nerves from stem cells. 
This discovery could help deaf patients regain the ability to hear. Although tests have only been conducted on animals, this new find has the potential to someday be offered to humans. 
Laboratory studies showed that new cells derived from fetal tissue functioned like normal ones in developing ears. This research shows promise of opening up possibilities to restore hearing in the future.

New devices could replace scientists
Scientists at Cornell University have come up with a new computer program that can go through large amounts of data and formulate theories based on that data. 
The program is based on a principle called genetic programming, and came up with correct physical laws after it analyzed complex data from a system consisting of a double pendulum. The scientists described the working of the program in an issue of the journal Science.
In the same issue of Science, British scientists reported the development of a robotic scientist called Adam. This robot is able to come up with hypotheses and test them by performing experiments.

Researchers build a   battery with viruses
Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have manipulated a virus, called M13, such that it is able to build a powerful lithium battery. 
The scientists did this by changing two genes of the virus.
This change of genes allowed the virus to construct a shell made of iron phosphate and also connect the shell to carbon nanotubes. 
Although iron phosphate is usually not a good conductor, nanoparticles of the substance help make a good battery. 
This gives rise to a small yet powerful electrode that can be used in such devices as MP3 players and cell phones. 
An iPod can be run for three times as long with this battery than with normal iPod batteries. These batteries are also more environmentally friendly than traditional batteries.
The research was reported in the journal Science.

New technology controls space fires
NASA gave a $100,000 grant to Colorado-based ADA Technologies to develop fire extinguishers for space fires. Space fires, caused due to accidents on space shuttles,  are different from those on earth as they are spherical and hence harder to control. 
The fire extinguishers consist of tiny droplets that will coat the flames in a mist and contain the fire. The device uses water and nitrogen and is also non-toxic. NASA wants to implement this technology in its Orion spacecraft. 
The current space shuttle fleet will be retired in 2010 and NASA plans to build the Orion spacecrafts, new capsule-style ships, that can travel to the moon and back.

New fuel tanks help hydrogen cars
New research conducted at Purdue University has made it possible to fill the fuel tanks of hydrogen-powered cars within five minutes, enabling the car to run for 300 miles. 
The device consists of a fine metal hydride that can absorb hydrogen gas.
A heat exchange system, which prevents the device from heating up, has also been created. This is especially helpful, as the efficiency of absorbing hydrogen decreases with an increase in temperature. 
The stored hydrogen will then be used to power a cell that can generate electricity and drive the car.

It has once again started out as a very Pittsburgh spring: a few really nice days of warm weather, bringing with it flip flops forsaken since the fall, computer science majors in their Hawaiian shirts, and people spreading out to do work all over the Cut. However, the warm bliss quickly seemed to draw to a close when a few days of cold rain set in, dampening the campus and making the journey from building to building a soggy, unpleasant trudge.
Now, with colder days ahead, it seems like spring is out of reach already. Though there’s not too much to do about the weather, some of these tips might help you feel more in the mood for warmer days, regardless of the chilly forecast.
Fashion: Add a little mimosa to your life
Time to break out of those heavy winter clothes and start reinventing your wardrobe for the spring season! The color of the year 2009 has been declared as mimosa, a sprightly yellow with hints of goldenrod. Mimosa was selected by Pantone, Inc., a company that specializes in producing inks and paints both for graphic artists and for publishing companies.
Mimosa, a bright, happy color, reflects the optimism that people have about the future and the hope that things will improve, whether it’s getting the economy back on track, planting a garden that actually sprouts and produces fruit or vegetables this year, or just becoming healthier in the new season. Spring is the time to start afresh and mimosa’s bright, warm hues reflect its wearer’s cheery outlook toward the future.
General suggestions are to pair mimosa with sky blues or with neutral grays or mushroom colors. Thus, you can create a happy but urban style, bound to be chic. Another upcoming trend seems to be wearing clothes more from bargain stores rather than from designers. While this is good for your wallet, be careful. You don’t want to completely compromise quality.
Going to the Avalon Exchange in Squirrel Hill will hook you up with some trendy vintage fashion at reasonable prices, sure to be a hit this spring.
Spring cleaning: It’s that time of year again
While not everyone relishes the thought of going through their rooms and fishing out all the stuff that winter and fall left behind, spring cleaning doesn’t have to be a chore that you avoid stoically. Start small, like cleaning up a desktop or a drawer, and then be sure to give yourself a break. You don’t need to be a whirlwind of cleaning goodness, sweeping through every nook and cranny of your dorm or apartment. What needs to happen is that you feel like you can start the new season fresh and ready to tackle any obstacles that come your way.
Go through your closet and look at what clothes you wear a lot and what has been left by the wayside. First, try to reuse the items that you really love or have loved, but have fallen out of your daily wear. In the economy’s current state, you might not be able to buy new clothes, but you can rework older clothes into your outfit by adding fresh new splashes of color, like a trendy scarf or a cute accessory to snap it up. Those clothes that you’re not so fond of anymore but are still in good shape can be donated to a charity or shelter. Since donations are down, the recipient of your old threads will surely appreciate your gesture.
Sometimes, all a messy area really needs is a good bit of reorganizing. If you haven’t been using your space as effectively as you want to, then look into some cheap methods of storage. Buying shelves can be a little pricey, but Bed, Bath & Beyond or IKEA will usually carry some storage devices that fall within your budget. Also, be sure to use shelf space already in your room. Ledges by windows can be ready-made shelves, as well as a neat display for your knickknacks.
If you have an item that might be valuable but you don’t have the space or need for it, try selling it on eBay or Craigslist. It’ll get the clutter out of your room and put money back in your wallet, two things that are great to start out spring with.
Time management: Daylight savings got you down?
The leap forward is always hard on everybody. Waking up one hour earlier seems like a rip-off at first, even if it does leave more time in the sun later on in the season. With more midterms, papers due, and finals to prepare for as the final stretch of the spring 2009 semester begins to draw to a close, time is at a premium and sleep suffers. Use these tips to help plan the day more effectively and save up for some quality time with your pillow.
First, start off by making a list. It doesn’t have to be a list of every single thing that needs to get done in your life, but it should have some goals that you’d like to accomplish. What also works well if you’re feeling the crunch is to write a list of all the projects, assignments, or tests that are stressing you out. Get everything out and onto the paper, even if it’s something that should be enjoyable but is causing you to worry about it, like preparing a presentation for your favorite club or an upcoming sports match.
Next, start preparing. Budget your time over the next week and look at how you’ll have to allot your time and effort to make everything work. If your schedule starts looking too hectic, then prioritize. You don’t have to do everything, especially not when it’s interfering with your schoolwork or stressing you out. Plan for tests about a week and a half in advance and try to look over homework assignments, readings, or papers, a week before they come due. This way, you’ll have a better idea of what you’ll need to accomplish by the end of the week’s time. What’s great is that your brain will be working on them even while you’re not as your subconscious goes over things you’ve seen or encountered. It’s like multi-tasking without the effort: just let your sleeping brain do the work!
Set out times to actually do what you’ve planned. Making a big schedule and putting things in order isn’t of any use if you don’t actually do it. If your homework is looking to be a bit much, then start a study group. With finals on the horizon, it’s never too late to get together with a bunch of classmates and try to boost your grades before the last exams start. Give yourself rewards for getting things done on time, like an hour solely devoted to Facebook or a night out catching the newest movies.
You shouldn’t spend every waking moment working, though. Getting everything done that you want to accomplish (and see as reasonable to accomplish within your time frame) is a great feeling, but don’t feel like you need to overwork yourself to stay on top of the crowd. While everyone usually touts all-nighters as helping them through difficult subjects or essays, staying up all through the night usually just leaves you tired and less likely to understand things the next day, leaving you needing to catch up the next day. Eight hours of sleep is recommended, but for young adults, the amount of time needed is usually more: around nine to 10. The extra hours of sleep you get contribute to how creative and responsive you’ll be the next day.
If you’re still having trouble getting everything done, ask yourself when you’re at your most productive. If that happens to be in the evening, hyped up on a few shots of espresso from the library, then go for that. If you, like most people, get tired and find that you can’t work as well late at night, consider going to bed earlier, getting your sleep, and then waking up earlier. Most people aren’t awake by then, so the dorms and apartments are fairly quiet. You can work in peace and feel motivated to get your work done instead of falling prey to the numerous distractions of the Internet late at night.
Whatever your reason, spring is the time to get out there and start changing things around for the better. Start spicing up your closet, enjoy the weather soon to come (but come prepared with an umbrella!), and get ready to budget your time for Buggy and Carnival. This year promises to be a fun one, so get out there and start making spring work for you.

I’ve never been a huge fan of taking unnecessary risks, particularly ones that involve wasting my time and money. 
So getting on an elektrichka, or electric train, by myself and heading out of St. Petersburg to Oranienbaum, without having the slightest idea where I am going to be dropped off and what I am going to find there, is somewhat out of character.
As I try to figure out how to buy the tickets and how to get on the train, I attempt, with moderate success, to convince myself that I am adventuring. 
I sit in one of the farthest cars and hope that I really bought a round-trip ticket and not just a one-way. The ticket seller and I had repeated “there and back” to each other a few times, so I’m pretty sure it was all understood. 
I want to sit by myself, but not completely by myself, because there’s always a chance that some young drunk guys will get on, and in that case, I want to be sitting next to an older woman or a family, not just because I‘m wary of drunken young men, but also because I know that if they speak to me, it will be abundantly clear that I am American. 
I try to look out the window, but I am sitting facing the sun, which is somewhat unfortunate, so I sit back and try to read the Agatha Christie novel that I had bought in Russian. This is surprisingly difficult, so I have to pretend that I am absorbed completely in it, when everything that I have feared happens and a man comes up to me and addresses me. 
“Miss,” he says. I ignore him and hope that he will go away. “Ticket, miss,” he says, laughing at my apparent fascination with my book. 
Relieved, I hand him the receipt that I have been using as a bookmark, and he marks an “s” on it and leaves. I sit back and try to look out the window, watching people get on and off the train.
Fifty-five minutes later, I’m starting to worry a little about where the train will drop me off. 
Will I be able to see the Grand Menshikov Palace from the train? Will there be a map somewhere? 
Will I have to ask for directions? Or get on another bus?
I’m starting to worry because we’re in the middle of the countryside by this point, and the people on the train are carrying skiing or ice fishing equipment and the like. 
Finally, we get to a stop, but I miss the sign, and I don‘t know what it is. Everyone in my car gets off, and the loudspeaker says “(static, crackle crackle) Oranienbaum,” so I run off the train and hurry over to the sign, which is just out of my line of sight. 
Just as I get there, the doors close, and the train lumbers off. It’s the wrong station.
First, I am calm, but then I start to panic a little. I don’t know the train schedule, and I don’t know when the next one will come through. 
It’s 1 p.m. I know possibly there will be one around 4, but before that? Ever? 
I’m sitting on a train platform surrounded by woods. The train ride was supposed to be an hour long, so for a few minutes I consider walking along the track. I’d have to get there sometime, right? 
I dismiss this idea as possibly insane, especially considering the six inches or so of snow, and sit and wait. I watch the few people walking away from the train carrying bags of fruit.
Finally, I decide to go exploring and, walking down the platform, I find a piece of paper taped to the side of a bulletin board that claims that a train is coming in an hour going to a destination that is not Oranienbaum, but I think may just be further along my route. 
I just hope that no one checks my ticket again, especially since I think I have only one stop to go.
It’s about now that I come to the unpleasant realization that I’ve forgotten some of my documentation that I always have to carry around in St. Petersburg. 
So if a cop stops me in the street, I could be arrested, 26 miles outside of St. Petersburg, where my host may or may not be able to help me get out of jail. 
I’m pretty sure I’ve got my passport, but maybe not my spravka, my registration, and I’m not about to start fishing through my stuff looking. 
To put the icing on the cake, I drop my book in the mud and discover that the mini-pies I brought for lunch are not good. 
I descend into the depths of despair, but then am completely euphoric, because finally the train arrives and everything starts getting better. I even see a building I think is the palace from the window of the train, so maybe I will be able to find it easily.
Suddenly, it’s an exciting adventure again and there is a beautiful park to explore, if I can only find it and still be back at the train station by 5:30 p.m. 
In the end, of course, I’m really glad I went. Even if it’s sometimes a little hard to get around, it’s always worth it, and 
I wouldn’t trade the experiences I’ve had and will continue to have in Russia for anything else.

As the famous saying goes, “X marks the spot” — or in this case, Topshop marks its debut in Soho on April 2, with a crowd all too eager to scoop up the best of the U.K.’s fashion finds. After an excruciatingly long wait for the store to open, Topshop was unveiled at 12:55 a.m. last Thursday in downtown New York, with a line of people that wrapped around the block twice.
Topshop is a retailer, previously only available overseas, about whom proponents have generated endless buzz from day one — complimenting the trendiness of the pieces available for girls with normal and realistic budgets. In the U.S., not many stores have been able to parallel Topshop’s characteristics of carrying stylish, well-made clothing that’s also affordable. The most well-known rivals include Zara and H&M, both of which also began in Europe — Spain and Sweden specifically.
What’s the big deal about Topshop? Aside from a collaboration line with supermodel Kate Moss, the store has also influenced the direction of fashion among young women. The mash-ups of floral frocks and playful jumpsuits with tough ankle-strap heels and studded booties come directly out of Topshop’s website, and the effect has been tremendous. 
International fashion bloggers and runway models alike have long sang the praise of wearable and buyable clothing from this store, and some of the retailer’s inspired looks have even been spotted on our very own campus.
A military-esque shirt dress will remain a classic piece, wearable all year round. However, Helen Ra, a sophomore business administration major, takes it to the next level with one made of denim. A fabric once restricted to making jeans, denim has recently taken the fashion world by storm by claiming its stakes in loose, menswear-inspired button-down shirts, nautical jumpers, trousers, and, of course, dresses. It’s a great twist to otherwise classic basics, and it won’t be going out of fashion anytime soon.
There’s no better time than spring to let your legs breathe, and first-year science and humanities scholar Jessica Sochol does it in just the right way. Taking advantage of a warm and breezy day, Sochol wears a thin paisley print blouse and keeps the rest of her outfit simple with a fitted navy blazer and a pair of shorts. She tops her outfit off with Tibi sandals that have a tough gladiator feel, and they provide the perfect contrast to her feminine blouse.
Topshop boasts some great shopping finds for girls like Ra and Sochol, and it also serves as another stylish alternative to stocking up on basics — T-strap sandals, tights in a hue of colors, T-shirts of varying transparency, and charming necklaces and earrings. Even though Topshop’s only store is at its flagship Soho location, topshop.com is now open to the U.S., so even if you’re just looking for inspiration for tomorrow’s outfit, be sure to pay a visit to the next big thing.

The walkie-talkie on Todd Brown’s shoulder is clicking and shuddering with activity. Through a gritty line of static, a voice emerges: “Are we ready?” Brown looks out onto Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall and takes a deep breath. “Okay,” he says. “Time to think.”
Brown is a lighting technician at Carnegie Mellon who, for tonight, carries a heavy responsibility. He is in charge of lighting for the School of Music’s Collage Concert, which took place at Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall last Friday night.
The Collage Concert is simple in concept. It is a 90-minute, non-stop performance, featuring all the major music ensembles at Carnegie Mellon, with additional performances by School of Music professors and alumni.
The execution, however, is complex. How do you fill such a massive space with sound and keep it up for 90 straight minutes?
The answer lies with Brown and his colleague, Karla Boos, who is directing the event. The key, according to Brown, is the careful positioning of the different ensembles in different parts of the venue. For example, when an ensemble finishes performing on stage, another ensemble begins on the balcony. 
Though Boos handles the positioning, it is Brown’s burdensome job to make sure those who are performing are seen (and not blinded), while muting the movement and activity in other parts of the hall. “A lot of it is on me,” Brown said before the performance. “I’m feeling the pressure.”
The first spotlight of the night is not on any of the evening’s performers. Instead it is on Noel Zahler, head of the School of Music. It was Zahler who brought the idea of a Collage Concert to Carnegie Mellon from the University of Minnesota, where he used to serve as head of School of Music. “We live in difficult times,” he said. “People say music [is] at the periphery of what we need to. I would counter that music is the most important thing that we need to do.”
Brown sits at his lighting station — which, with dozens of blinking lights and flashing icons, looks more like the bridge for the Enterprise than a computer. He is poised and listening attentively. When the speech is over, he swings into action. 
With the flick of a wrist and the smack of a finger, the room bursts into a deep shade of blue and the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic pounds out Dmitri Shostakovich’s thundering “Festive Overture.”
The orchestra soon dissolves into silence and glides off stage as a moody white light now shines on the balcony. At its nucleus stands Alberto Almarza, a professor of flute and music history at Carnegie Mellon. Accompanied by a dancer, Almarza begins with nimble fragility, confident of the musical space he is occupying. Then, from the corner of the balcony, a photographer emerges. He’s standing right between Brown and Almarza, making it impossible to see if the lights are in the right position. 
“He’s in my line of sight!” Brown says. The cameraman is clicking and approaching Almarza fast. Brown leaps out of his seat, onto his tiptoes. Almarza is now growling and screeching through his flute. The dancer is in full-sway, her gestures becoming more and more animated as the music pulses, pulses, and builds. 
The shutter goes off until, finally, the cameraman ducks away. The music calms. The dancer slows. The light is still in the right place when the song ends. Brown sits back down and takes a deep breath. 
There are different definitions of the word “collage,” but according to the academic powerhouse Wikipedia, it is a “work of formal art ... made from an assemblage of different forms, thus creating a new whole.” During the jazz vocal ensemble’s version of George Gershwin’s “Embraceable You,” one of these “new wholes” is created.
Unfortunately, Brown can’t capture it with lighting. That’s because it comes not from any of the singers, but from an anonymous member of the jazz ensemble, who is positioned in the opposite portion of the balcony. As the singers belt with raucous enthusiasm, the jazz musician beatboxes, head-bobs, and jams along with singers. It’s comical at first, but on second look, it’s empowering; he’s sitting in the dark on the opposite side of the balcony and still feels like he’s got something musical to contribute.
This jam is representative of how well many of the musicians in this community relate to and communicate with each other. It’s not a new concept that musicians of different backgrounds and training can co-mingle, but it’s an impressive moment when the idea is played out.
It’s not the anonymous jazz musician’s only musical endeavor of the evening, either. Brown’s lights soon go up on the balcony in full flare, now shining on Carnegie Mellon’s jazz ensemble itself. They perform “Cover,” a piece written by junior composition major Alex Weston. 
It’s exuberant music that passes through heavy-handed rock beats, airy jazz solos, and odd time signatures with great ease. Though Weston said it wasn’t he who was grooving with the singers, it might as well have been; he seamlessly internalizes music of many disciplines.
For the final number of the evening, the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic Concert Choir, as well as various soloists, join together for a rendition of Leonard Bernstein’s “Candide: Make Our Garden Grow.” The Philharmonic and soloists fill the stage, while the choir — dressed in regal robes and tuxedos — swarm the aisles. 
No special lighting is needed now, as the physicality and geometry of so many musicians performing together is dramatic enough. Brown turns off his own lights and turns the house lights on. “We’re neither pure, nor wise, nor good,” the choir sings, echoing Zahler’s comments on today’s complicated economic, political, and cultural climate.
The song resolves, however, in true Carnegie Mellon fashion: “We’ll do the best we know.”

Last Sunday, The Gaslight Anthem came to Pittsburgh with the intent on putting on a good show. As Mr. Small’s Theatre began to fill up, whispers of eagerness were strung around the entire space. Exactly when the clock struck 8, the first band of the opening act of the night came onto the stage. While most of the audience was not at the concert for the bands playing in the opening act, people offered applause and attention to them. The show had a good mix of openers and a crowd-pleasing primary act that was hard to complain about.  
Good Old War, the first opening act, is a three-person band. The group played soothing folk music, focusing on the harmonies within each song. Sometimes two and sometimes all three of the members were singing for the entire performance, creating beautiful harmonies. Good Old War captured most of the audience’s attention right away, as the audience was constantly moving and clapping to the music. Overall, their performance made for an apt choice for an opening act.   
After Good Old War came the second opening act, Heartless Bastards. Erika Wennerstrom, the lead singer, was heavily obscured while singing incomprehensible lyrics. Unfortunately, Heartless Bastards’ 45-minute performance felt more like a primarily rock-instrumental performance with rasps of either unintelligible or uninteresting lyrics. Overall, though, it was an engaging performance, mainly because of the jam-styled music of the band. 
Then The Gaslight Anthem came onto stage, bringing wild cheers from the entire audience. Brian Fallon, the lead singer, walked up to the microphone and, immediately, the band went into its first song of the night, as fists pumped and hands clapped everywhere. The entire audience was ready for them, and the band didn’t disappoint. 
Although featuring a set list primarily consisting of songs from their newest album, The ’59 Sound, The Gaslight Anthem did play some songs from their previous album, Sink Or Swim. The band is not typically known for a very diverse selection of songs; many of their songs sound incredibly similar. Their sound was quite good, with crunching guitars and Fallon’s voice, which surprisingly had nearly no discernible change in the transition from the CD to the concert setting. 
As a way of giving the band a break, Fallon talked to the audience between every two or three songs. His sense of humor was quickly apparent, as he managed to make the entire audience roar with laughter nearly every time he went to speak. Whether it was talking about waiting for his syrup bottle to come alive and talk to him as a kid or discussing the dangers of breaking up with a musical artist, Fallon displayed an immensely quick talent for setting up an atmosphere. 
After the concert was over and the crowd mostly gone, Fallon and his bandmates came out to the floor to talk to the remnants. While many of the remaining people on the floor simply wanted a picture or to thank him for the good show, there were others who had questions. Speaking earnestly and still with his quirky sense of humor, Fallon attempted to answer each of the questions asked. 
The Gaslight Anthem’s concert performance might sound very similar to their CDs, but seeing them live offers an experience that can’t quite be had with simply a CD. Whether it was Fallon’s quirky sense of humor or their adamant attempt to keep the audience involved and connected with the concert, The Gaslight Anthem puts on a really good show.

There were two lines that snaked through David Lawrence Hall for Spike Lee’s lecture last Tuesday, and they met in a semicircle in the middle. This half moon was made of University of Pittsburgh students, faculty, and staff on the right while the general public waited in line on the left. 
After everyone was seated, there were moments of constant chatter and conversation, but soon, Lee was walking down the aisle sporting his signature New York Yankees New Era fitted hat, a cap that commemorates each year the Yankees have won a World Series Championship. He looked relaxed in a Yankees track jacket and loose-fitting jeans, and was soon invited by the president of the Black Action Society to speak at the podium.
He began with a history. He said his mother dragged him to watch movies and explore museums, so as a child he was immersed in the arts. After graduating from John Dewey High School in 1975, he attended his father and grandfather’s alma mater, Morehouse College in Atlanta, Ga. During his first two years, his grades averaged around a C, and before the summer of 1977, his adviser explained that he had exhausted all of his electives and that he shouldn’t come back from Brooklyn until he knew what he wanted to do. He described the feeling, saying “one move, one step, and I’d be off a cliff. Seemed like a spirit came and moved me in a new direction.”
He went home during the hottest summer on record, and he beat the blackout with a Super 8 camera. He began filming black New Yorkers and Nuyoricans going to the disco amid the terror that David Berkowitz, a serial killer also known as the Son of Sam, had brought upon the city. He returned to school with the footage and declared mass communication as his major. After that, he focused on being a filmmaker.  
After graduating from Morehouse on May 8, 1979, he said he didn’t want to go to Hollywood and work his way up from the mail room, so he decided to apply to film school. He got into the prestigious Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, moving into a studio apartment off Myrtle Avenue, and began making a movie. 
After he won the student Academy Award, he called his agent, who told him to “be patient.” He sat the plaque on top of his TV and waited by the phone. After two weeks, his grandmother told him to “get off his skinny, rusty butt and make it happen.” 
Lee moved on to talk about two specific films, School Daze and Malcolm X, his second and fifth films respectively. With School Daze, he wanted to show that “the black college campus experience is a microcosm of the black community as a whole.”
Lee is smart because he understands the significance of a supporting cast. Even though they may only be in a scene for just a moment, the strength of their individual performances are integral pieces in the puzzle that he puts together. Having actors like Kerry Washington, Jon Leguizamo, and Jon Turturro reappear creates some continuity within his entire body of work. These familiar faces fortify his films. Lee’s films force you into a realm of thought and cause you to consider current climate and contemporary racism.

Snuff is author Chuck Palahniuk’s ninth fiction novel, first released on May 20, 2008, but it will be reprinted in paperback this month. 
The definition of snuff, as it’s meant in this case at least, is the motion picture genre that depicts the actual death or murder of a person or people, without the aid of special effects, for the express purpose of distribution and entertainment. And it just so happens that the genre of this particular book is porn.
In Snuff, we meet Cassie Wright, a legendary porn actress who intends to end her infamous career the only way she knows how — with a bang. A gang bang in technical terms, and none of that foursome crap either. 
Six hundred men and one woman — truly a Guinness World Record any one of us would love to have, and Wright does this in desperate hope that this stunt will result in her death, which raises the obvious question of why, a question that results in a rather shockingly funny answer.
The story unfolds from the perspectives of four people, #72, #137, #600, and Wright’s personal assistant — Sheila. As each of the 600 men waits for their “alone time” with the ex-porn star, our three “heroes” and the lady inform the reader as to how they became a part of such a sordid affair, what they hope to accomplish by participating, and all sorts of other interesting tidbits about the wide world of pornography.
What eventually becomes the elephant in the room and one of many story arcs is the possibility that Cassie Wright had a porn child — as in she became pregnant while shooting porn with one of the many men she’s had in her life — and that it’s been a secret her entire life. 
That, along with questions about who the father is, reverberates constantly around the green room, where 600 men wait for their 15 minutes (or seconds) of fame.
For anyone else who has read all of Palahniuk’s novels, it’s safe to say that while every book is absurd in a different way each time, he has settled into somewhat of a premeditated form of writing. 
In each of his books, you’ll have a crazy premise, in this case a porno to end all pornos, followed by some twist — a porn child? — and then things start getting a little weird, until finally things go absolutely nuts and Palahniuk goes completely off the deep end.
Of course, this is the case with Snuff, but the road Palahniuk takes isn’t really captivating. 
While reading the book, it just felt like waiting for the next plot twist or big revelation, not so much like a story was actually playing out. This was much like the way his previous book, Rant, was written. 
Things just kind of drag in the middle as you wait for things to go awry, and while they do in a big way in that book, in Snuff, the climax just doesn’t hit as hard as those in his previous works.
That being said, Palahniuk is one of today’s most creative and innovative writers. His nihilistic writing style is a perfect parallel to today’s tough times, yet his wordplay always manages to bring a smile to the reader’s face. 
It is enjoyable to watch him craft a character so carefully one way, only to flip him on his head in a second with no regard to what the reader may be feeling toward him. 
With Palahniuk, the star becomes an extra in a moment’s notice and the “other guy” becomes the savior. His quick, black humor wrapped up nicely in short sentences will keep pulling you back in, even through the occasional periods of the book that seem to drag on and on. His wit is lethal and his table manners very impolite.
Another little extra you’ll get in Snuff, along with the rest of Palahniuk’s novels, is the incredible amount of research he puts in to every book he writes. 
Like Michael Crichton, Palahniuk will often throw in little-known facts, usually of the wild kind, into his novels, and with this book, you’ll end up knowing more about the world of well-attended sex acts and porn in general than you probably ever wanted to know.
The bottom line is that fans of Palahniuk will adore this novel as another opportunity to check out his unbelievable writing, and even for those who aren’t familiar with his work, this really is a solid form of entertainment and a great way to kill a long car ride.

Tech describes the prospects for the 1909 baseball team. With a new coach who is “rounding into championship form,” the team is practicing every day. There is one sour note, however. One player is accused of poor batting. His defense was “at least I didn’t shoot myself in the leg.” It would take Pittsburgh a hundred years to understand that comment.

The theme for Spring Carnival is officially “Spring Steals.” Organizations will build booths that relate to thievery. For instance, one fraternity is building a booth based on Jack and the Beanstalk. Another is titled “Stolen Bases,” which focuses on baseball. In related news, entrance fees for booth have been raised to $2000 per organization. When a group complained that they were being robbed, officials responded with: “Exactly.”

A freak snowstorm on Easter Sunday leaves students befuddled. Pictures are shown of daffodils covered in snow and of two students carrying umbrellas, both of whom are clearly oblivious that umbrellas are mostly used in different kinds of precipitation. Thankfully, since this is Pittsburgh, 15 minutes after the photo was shot, a half-hour heat wave struck campus.

A student forum is held to investigate whether Carnegie Mellon is an apathetic community. A philosophy and ethics major feels that it isn’t and loves the “energy that people have.” Another student feels differently, and expresses her anguish in trying to get people involved. Then the question came up about whether incentives should be given out to encourage students to support causes. Most people felt that it was completely unnecessary to do so. The talk was immediately followed by free pizza and soda, with 10 social points awarded to each participant.

With increasing first-year class sizes and limited spaces, the room draw leaves several first-year students homeless. This means that many students will be left living in apartments, or even hotels with room service. One first-year who dealt with the error laments about how he has to wash his hair with tiny bottles of shampoo, and that when the maid makes his bed, the folding of the top sheet is done in a haphazard fashion. Thankfully, students will eventually be placed in dorms, where they can experience the true joy of waiting for 20 minutes to use public toilets.

Dear Joe,
I was recently dumped over the way I dress. My (former) girlfriend has over 100 dresses and more shoes than I can count. I, on the other hand, have a few unwashed shirts and a four-year-old pair of shoes. Does it really matter what I wear? I thought personality was all on the inside.
—Dressed Down in Donner
Dear Dressed,
I can’t stand fashion. It makes absolutely no sense to me, and I always seem to look like the “before” picture even if I take time to look nice. I’m sorry that your style caused the downfall of your relationship. Maybe it was never meant to happen.
But while it may seem vain, Dressed, it’s a fact of life that we are judged heavily by the way we dress. Honestly, can you imagine a man in a Hawaiian shirt not being relaxed? Or a person with a thousand political buttons on her backpack being reserved? Clothes are really the first thing people can judge us on. That means you might want to run your wardrobe through the washer if you want to find another girl.
You might even want to get some new clothes. This doesn’t necessarily mean that you have to spend thousands on designer shoes. Just a few decent shirts and a respectable pair of jeans should do the trick. Remember, you’re at Carnegie Mellon, which means if you’re not dressed like a character from Lord of the Rings, you have a huge advantage over the field.
But let’s face the facts, Dressed. I don’t know a thing about dressing properly. What I do know, however, is this: women don’t like slobs. This pits some of us against huge odds for getting a date. Try and stay clean, Dressed, and you might find your romantic life just a little bit more fruitful.
A personality helps too, 
—Joe
Dear Joe,
I think I might have taken April Fools’ too far. Thinking it would just be for fun, I pulled a hotfoot on one of my friends. Unfortunately, his pants caught on fire and now he even has some burn scars from the joke. How do I make up for this?
—Fired in Frick
Dear Fired,
The hotfoot is a great joke when seen in a movie or read in a book, but not many other places. For those who don’t know, the hotfoot is when you place a blue-tipped match in the sole of someone’s shoe. Thus, when they walk, they light the match, and supposed hilarity ensues. Unfortunately, sometimes a small flame turns into a big fiasco.
For you, Fired, it’s going to take a long time to make up for this one. You’re obviously a prankster, but if you want to build your reputation back up, I wouldn’t pull anything like you did for a long time. That means putting away your whoopee cushions, handshake buzzers, and squirt-gun flowers. Even after you’ve changed your ways, your friendship will still never be the same again. I mean, you burned his leg for crying out loud.
May this be a lesson for all of you this April Fools’ season. Pranks are a great way to spread cheer and reduce the serious tone that so many people at Carnegie Mellon are afflicted with. Just be sure to keep away from pranks that can burn, shame, or maim the victims. Remember, it’s April Fools’, not April Cruels.
Your shoe’s untied, 
—Joe

Tonight, I spun the clickwheel of my iPod until “Ride Around Shining” by Clipse came up. Upon its release, the song and the album that housed it sparked a debate among the Internet cognoscenti about its ethics, or lack thereof. 
Was Hell Hath No Fury a nuanced treatment of the drug trade’s moral complexities or a raw glorification of crack and the cash that came of it?
I never really took a side in that argument — the ruthlessness of the production transfixed me more than the cold-hearted consumerism of the lyrics.  
Returning to the song, nearly two years later, it seems unsettlingly prescient. It’s as if Clipse knew, in the summer of ’07, that the housing bubble was overdue for bursting, and that the economy, a year and a half down the road, would be stumbling and desperate, like a crack addict caught in Virginia Beach traffic (of two kinds). “All I wanna do is ride around shinin’ while I can afford it” — did they know? 
Listening to the song today, it’s hard to say if the cloud of detuned piano that hovers over the minimal beat presages collapses or confirms it. 
Is that miasma of notes the tremor that says “earthquake,” or the dust of crushed concrete settling after disaster has already come? Are Clipse a pair of fortunetellers or funeral directors? 
The song, like its creators, seems caught between violent scenes. Virginia Beach rappers aren’t dirty South and they aren’t New York. They’re coastal, smooth, but never as glib as Snoop and Dre. 
They wouldn’t fit in Los Angeles. They rap in suspension, with the devil-may-care edge of a parolee speeding past the police station in a stolen convertible.   
A decade that started with a hyped crisis that never materialized (Y2K) is ending with an economic crisis borne of over-hyped material (toxic securities). 
For this author, “Ride Around Shining” is the anthem that captures the spirit of those two endpoints, as it cruises on a vaporous chassis, grille gleaming, right between them.

On March 31, the ballots were in and the winners were clear: Rotimi Abimbola and Adam Klein for student body president (SBP) and student body vice president (SBVP), with Nara Kasbergen as student body vice president of finance (SBVPF). 
This year’s elections experienced a 20 percent increase in student voters, as estimated by Elections Board data, and was described by all three candidates as a really tough race. Although only days into their offices, all candidates already have immediate plans for action.
Both Abimbola, a junior double major in political science and international relations, and Klein, a junior double major in business administration and history and policy, thanked their competitors for all their hard work.
“The competition and greater campus awareness pushed us to make sure our platform was really solid,” Abimbola said.
The pair’s biggest initiative continues to be transparency, with the intention of ensuring accountability.
They plan to continue “Ask Adam, Talk to Timi,” their biweekly video as part of Mad Minutes, a brief update on what student government is up to, which is aired on their website, www.ak2009.com.
In discussion of office hours, the two showed their uniqueness in the way they interact as a pair. While Abimbola doubted the success of the program in past years, Klein suggested simply moving the location to a very public space like the Cut.
“You can see me being jaded from student government and Adam coming in with a fresh voice,” Abimbola said.
They both commented Jared Itkowitz and Pooja Godbole for their initiation of the Football Fever program and hope to expand it even further into the Tartan Rewards program. 
This progam would  honor students for constant attendance with the help of corporate sponsors, the athletic department, and other departments around campus.
“As it is now, people are coming to the games for the wrong reasons,” Klein said. “We can see this in the attendance in the games before and after [the featured ones]. We want to reward them for consistently coming.”
The pair will also be continuing the new Loop shuttle service, offering late-night rides back to campus for students at stops throughout Oakland and Station Square, and expanding the roles and positions available on the cabinet.
To ensure transparency in the financial realm, they have begun talking to the CFO about preparing student literature on exactly where tuition goes.
They have started organizing a Textbook Flea Market and Yard Sale for the end of the school year or the start of next fall semester.
The two are also planning to introduce first-year students to some of the core organizations on campus — Activities Board, Student Dormitories Council, cmuTV, and The Tartan — before all the others. 
They want students to see that they are part of the entire university, not just one little organization or residence.
“We want to sow a seed of pride in them that grows in their time here,” Abimbola said. For Abimbola and Klein, the campaign has not yet ended. They hope for the campaign momentum to carry on.
Like her fellow winners, Kasbergen wants to increase transparency of student government actions. As SBVPF, she hopes to allocate funding so that students can see the value of their $92 student activities fee truly affecting their lives.
While Kasbergen said that the Joint Funding Committee (JFC) could always use more money, she said it was a matter of perspective for students: “They will never see a need to raise the fee but rather, one to just use the money more efficiently.”
Kasbergen said that her biggest challenge next year will be to use the money as efficiently as possible due to increasing strains from the economy. 
“A lot of organizations are used to relying on department funding, corporate sponsors, and grants, all of which are now harder to come by,” she said. 
Kasbergen has a number of ideas to help increase the efficiency of the JFC in the coming year.
She hopes to expand on the auditing system begun by former SBVPF Evan Osheroff, in which organizations sat down with their JFC representatives and broke down their exact budget for the year. 
Kasbergen said that the plan was met with some resistance this year due to its being viewed by some JFC representatives as micro-managing. 
“Auditing might even be the wrong word,” she said. “It would just really help JFC representatives to get to know the organization before providing funding.”
Kasbergen plans to continue to reform Budget Tracker, as well as allowing religious groups to apply for JFC funding. 
Kasbergen’s most immediate plan, however, will be to sit down with Osheroff to go over, as well as update, the JFC bylaws.
The three winners of the student elections will be working closely to bring their campaigns to fruition.
“I’m really excited to get to work with [Abimbola],” Kasbergen added.

A new research study conducted by Thomas J. Espenshade, a professor of sociology, and Chang Young Chung, a statistical programmer, both from Princeton University, finds that dropping standardized test scores as an admissions requirement will lead to increased percentages of minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged students admitted to college. 
The research will be formally presented next month at a conference at Wake Forest University regarding college admission.
The study is based on a variety of models, all using actual admissions data the from institutions studied, and patterns in applications once institutions switch to SAT-optional. 
In the modeling, the researchers assumed that at the SAT-optional colleges, those with high SAT scores would continue to submit them and be helped by them.
The researchers also noted that there would be no advantage for having high SAT scores only at institutions with “don’t ask, don’t tell” policies.
The models showed that at the private colleges studied with a mean SAT score of 1405, the percentage of admitted applicants who are black would increase from 8 percent to 11 percent in the scenario in which more minority students apply and the SAT becomes optional.  In this scenario, if the SAT is not considered at all, the percentage of admitted applicants who are black would go up to 13.8 percent. 
For Latino students, the percentage would go from roughly 8 percent to 10.6 percent in an SAT-optional system and to 12 percent when the SAT is not considered. 
Espenshade noted some caveats to the study, finding in particular that if the application pools do not increase, there is some danger, he said, that colleges might not have as many academically talented but test-averse applicants.
Joanna Dickert, coordinator of Student Affairs and teaching professor of the university-wide studies course Privilege, Responsibility and Community, said, “It is important to consider the type of preparedness that such tests actually measure. I think it also depends on how first-year student success is defined.
“To create a community that not only embraces diversity but facilitates the personal and professional success of its members, it is important that colleges and universities ensure that there are resources in place to support students throughout their campus experience. In order to be a community, they must be engaging one another intellectually and cultivating relationships in meaningful ways that allow all individuals to think critically about the cultural lens through which they experience the world,” she said.
“There should be some correlation between the test and performance,” said Gordon Weinber, a statistics professor at Carnegie Mellon. “The correlation is not perfect, but certainly not zero. As we have seen with the recent election, when intelligence and reason are applied, what has been previously called affirmative action could be a good thing.”
“Someone underqualified should not take the place of someone more qualified [at a university],” said Sean Lawley, a senior mathematics major and teaching assistant. “Race should not affect admissions at all; the finite resources for research and learning should be put forth to the best students in those schools. They should consider the best means to evaluate talent and use that.”
There is no word yet on which universities are considering making the SAT score optional on undergraduate applications.

This Thursday, the students of Carnegie Mellon will be able to see a sight they don’t see every day: large groups of men walking around in high-heeled shoes from 5 to 6 p.m.  which will take place Thursday on the Cut. 
The event taking place that day is called “Walk a Mile In Her Shoes.” This event is coordinated and sponsored by the Sexual Assault Advisors (SAA) board, which closely works with and receives help and leadership from Rowshan Palmer, the Student Life coordinator. The mission of the event is to inform the world of the important efforts that men are making in order to stop sexual violence. The Sexual Assault Advisors are a group of leaders on campus who advise and aid other students on sexual assault and related issues. 
In keeping with the fact that April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, the SAA board wanted to coordinate an event to raise awareness of sexual violence in which men a walk or march around the Cut wearing women’s high-heeled shoes. For Carnegie Mellon, this is the third year that this event is taking place.
“Right now, we’re in the stages of creating awareness at the event,” said Victoriya Kovalchuk, a senior BHA in design and writing. “We hope that in the future, this event will become a staple on campus and will become something that people will and can look forward to.”
The SAA Board is also getting a lot of support and aid from the Pittsburgh Action Against Rape (PAAR) and with 1 in 4, which is a Carnegie Mellon organization to promote men’s knowledge in preventing rape and sexual violence. Brad Hall, a senior mechanical engineering major and a member of 1 in 4, participated in the walk last year and said that he’s gained a newfound respect for women’s footwear.
“I vastly underestimated the amount of pain I would experience walking in high heels. If it takes that much pain to look pretty, I would make a hideous woman,” he said.
“The important thing to think about is that the reason why men are wearing these shoes is not only to show support for the cause but also because the issue of sexual assault is not only a women’s issue,” said Rachel Baldwin, an SAA board member and senior art major. 
She explained that the issue involves men too, although most people only think that women are affected.
Only male students will be able to participate in the walk.  
The campus organizers of “Walk a Mile in Her Shoes” are hoping that the Carnegie Mellon fraternity community will actively participate in the event.
“We hope to encourage a high level of participation from the men’s fraternities,” stated Hall in an e-mail. 
Pre-registration is not necessary, but regular registration for individuals or teams will take place from 4:30 to 5 p.m.

Carnegie Mellon students pitched their entrepreneurship ideas for companies in this year’s Tepper Venture Challenge, which was held yesterday in the Mellon Auditorium located in Posner Hall.
The Tepper Venture Challenge is an annual competition, started in 1998 by the Undergraduate Entrepreneurship Association, said junior H&SS interdisciplinary major Sachit Gupta. “At first it was a CMU-only business plan competition, but we have since expanded the competition to include regional colleges and universities,” he said.
Gupta and Corey Montella, a senior business administration and physics major, are vice-president and president, respectively, of the Undergraduate Entrepreneurship Association. The competition is currently open to all undergraduate students in Pennsylvania, and the applicant pool has been steadily growing each year. Based on the viability of their proposals, six teams were selected to present their ideas at the competition this year. Each of the teams had 10 minutes to introduce their proposals to the panel of judges, followed by an additional question-and-answer session.
The Tepper Venture Challenge tries to simulate the real process of entrepreneurship.
“The format is that of a pitch to venture capitalists [VC]. In fact, the judges are partners from local VC firms,” said senior computer science major Breck Frensen, who came in third place in the 2007 Tepper Venture Challenge. 
“You’re evaluated primarily on the quality of your idea as well as your ability to articulate it to the judges.”
While the Tepper Venture challenge has no specific guidelines for the types of business ideas that teams can submit and be entered into the competition, it asks participants to follow specific guidelines in their presentations to the panel of judges.
Montella explained, “Hands-on experience with pitching your business is one of the best ways to get your business started; it allows you to make mistakes and get feedback before you pitch to venture capitalists when it really counts.”
After the competition, the winning teams are encouraged to start their own businesses based on their proposals. In addition to receiving positive feedback from real venture capitalists and potential investors, students also receive a substantial cash prize that is meant to be used for marketing, business planning, and product development.
“Sometimes the only thing holding you back is the security of a job and a steady paycheck, but when that security is gone, taking that plunge is much easier,” said Gupta and Montella. 
“One of our favorite past winners is Luke Skurman. Luke won the Tepper Venture Challenge [TVC] when he was an undergraduate at [Carnegie Mellon] with his plan for his company, College Prowler. After graduating, he started his company and has had success with it ever since. He’s told us the most valuable thing he got from participating in the TVC was the feedback the judges gave him.”
Participants are graded not just on the quality and viability of their ideas, but also on their skill in communicating their ideas to the judges.
“The teams were graded on ... how [clearly] they communicated their proposals in a limited time,” said Meyer, Unkovic, and Scott LLP attorney David Obredeck, who had served as a judge.
Frensen also attributes his proposal’s standing to an inability to convey its potential. “My team’s idea was a website called Mave. The idea was to create a marketplace where people could post a service they needed and local service providers would automatically be alerted to the opportunity,” he explained. “Ultimately, the reason we didn’t win the competition that year was the same reason the website failed. It was a difficult idea to communicate and we were unable to make the connection in people’s minds that Mave was the easiest place to find a service provider.... We didn’t succeed; we failed.”
Obredeck also added, “If you have an innovative idea for a business ... you have to tell investors about it and convince them to trust you ... or it will remain an idea, not a business.”

The turn of the century has seen phenomenal growth in youth political involvement, said Robert Dry, diplomat-in-residence at City College of New York, to students in the Global and International Relations program during a luncheon discussion on Thursday.
Dry, a career United States diplomat who has held key positions in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, visited Carnegie Mellon to inform students about career opportunities in the U.S. Department of State, the main U.S. foreign affairs agency. 
“Current college students are part of what is known as the ‘millennial generation,’ characterized in part by an increased interest in community engagement,” said Traci Sebastian, academic adviser for the Global and International Relations program. 
A Georgetown alumna and former summer intern at the State Department, Sebastian described her “insider’s view of an embassy” as “fascinating.”
“I spent the summer after my junior year in college interning at the U.S. Embassy in Nassau, Bahamas,” said Sebastian. 
“I had been skeptical at first about working in the Bahamas. I didn't think of it as a place where much of interest would happen, from a political or economic point of view. But my experience that summer taught me that even small countries can have strategic importance to the U.S.,” she said. 
“Federal agencies seek people from various disciplines, and with a lot of different skills,” said Dry. 
From students specializing in written communication to computer scientists and engineers, there is something for every student who is able to produce “something completely different,” he said. 
“Within the embassy, I researched political, economic, and environmental issues, and drafted cables [reports] that were sent to the Department of State and other posts in the Caribbean,” said Sebastian. 
In addition to U.S. citizens who are proficient, capable, and hardworking in their respective fields, the State Department also encourages international students interested in foreign affairs and diplomacy to apply for internships and full-time positions with the State Department, said Dry. 
“Two-thirds of the State Department [is composed of] foreign nationals,” said Dry. 
The Foreign Service is a body of about 11,500 employees, as stated on the State Department’s website. 
Spread across 265 posts worldwide, these Foreign Service National (FSN) employees help bridge the gap between the local population and department officials with regard to language and cultural values, he said. 
Referring to his experience working with interns who were French nationals, Dry said that foreign students normally have a very comprehensive understanding of their countries. 
“They know their countries really well, which makes them interesting candidates, as well as cross-cultural targets for us,” said Dry. 
“For some students, an embassy internship crystallizes their interest in the Foreign Service; for me, my summer in the Bahamas, along with my year in Ireland, helped me to realize that while I love traveling abroad, I really enjoy living in the U.S.,” said Sebastian.
In order to secure an internship with the State Department, students must first register for a career track. Career tracks include management, economic, political, public diplomacy, international systems, and American history, among others. A detailed list of tracks and complete application procedures are available under Careers on the State Department’s website. 
Alex Brant, who is a graduate student in the Heinz public policy and management program, will be interning with the State Department in Rome, Italy this summer. 
“I will be working in the Management Office at the American Embassy in Rome this summer,” Brant stated in an e-mail. 
“I first heard about this internship at a State Department workshop hosted by the International Relations program, and filled out an application online. A few months later, I was offered to work at the consulate in Milan and Florence as well as the embassy in Rome,” stated Brant.  
“When our faculty designed the global politics major, they created the curriculum that they felt would best prepare our students not only for graduate school or globally-focused careers, but also for being engaged and informed global citizens,” said Sebastian. 
Excited to be a part of the Obama administration, Brant is eager to understand how American foreign policy works, he stated. 
“I feel like some changes will be made, and I will be a part of them,” he stated.
Fluent in Italian, Brant believes that he has an edge over the communicative challenge faced by a career diplomat. 
Megan Larcom, a junior business and global politics major said, “Ambassador Dry did a good job of conveying the lifestyle and the career trajectory of someone in Foreign Service.”
“I was surprised to learn how your geographical focus doesn't always remain constant; Ambassador Dry mentioned quite a few times when he had to learn new language sets — Chinese dialect, Vietnamese, and Arabic included,” she said. 
“Language is a window to other cultures,” said Dry. Knowing a foreign language reflects interest in other cultures and shows a sense of cross-cultural sensitivity, he said. 
This international frame of mind is what attracts Larcom, who is going abroad to the Middle East this summer to learn Arabic. 
“I am taking some classes right now that are really opening my eyes to new perspectives. Indira Nair's Global Issues, Local Solutions class is just one example of how CMU has helped me — we learn about U.N. Millennium Development Goals and our relation to the developing world,” said Larcom. 
As more students express interest in politics, Carnegie Mellon aims to keep up with the growing trend in youth political participation through its Global and International Relations program.  
“Students seem to have a keen interest in public service, and many of them seem to be considering careers in the public sector,” said Sebastian. 
“Dr. Kiron Skinner, the program director, has done a tremendous job of raising its profile, which has only existed for about 10 years now. We have supplemented the academic program by bringing speakers to campus that expose our students to a wide range of global topics. And whenever possible, we bring guests like Mr. Dry to campus to talk about career opportunities in the State Department and other areas of government,” she said.

Carnegie Mellon's revised smoking policy is currently in effect, but the campus community may not have truly seen the effects of the policy yet. With a sizable community of smokers on campus, we thought we'd share some demographic statistics about smoking in the United States: 
Men who smoke in U.S.: 26.2 million
Women who smoke in U.S.:  20.9 million
Percent of college students who are smokers: 28.5
Percent of smokers who consider themselves "casual smokers": 33
Average age when college smokers had first cigarette: 14

With the economy slowly spiraling into its current downturn, unemployment rates rising, and university endowments across the country in less stable states than in previous years, the fact that colleges are looking more favorably on applicants who can pay their own way shouldn’t be surprising. Sure, we’d all like it if every college or university was need-blind, or if they were willing to take in students solely on basis of talent, but the reality is far from ideal.
While no school has gone so far as to openly state that applying for financial aid hurts a student’s chances of admission, officials are divided as to how to admit the students that they want and still remain financially sound. According to a recent New York Times article about aid in universities, some colleges have opted to shift money from financial aid to something called “merit aid” as a way of offering a compromise. While financial aid has the connotation of being used to help families who would incur monetary difficulties by sending their child to school, merit aid is money that is awarded to students based on talent, regardless of financial background. Sound good? The bottom line is that, basically, while some students from affluent families may no longer qualify for financial aid, they can still soften the blow on their parents’ bank accounts by ranking up a few thousand dollars in merit aid instead.
The idea of merit aid is sound in theory. After all, aren’t we trying to make America into a meritocracy, where everyone has the job or place in life that their hard work has earned them? It seems like giving students aid based on raw talent is what scholarships have been about from their inception. However, the way that this merit aid is put into practice could undermine its mission.
For example, let’s say that a university has two applicants vying for one spot in its freshman class, both of whom are equally qualified for admission. One is from a family that could afford to send their student to school without going into debt, while the other would need a full-ride scholarship to attend. Using the guidelines of merit aid, the university could offer both students the same sized scholarship, which would probably be less than half tuition. The student from a wealthy background could go to school on that amount, as well as bring in money from tuition payments. However, the student in need of a full scholarship would be forced to look elsewhere unless their family went into substantial debt.
This way, some universities are avoiding having to pay out bigger scholarships and are still saying that they admit students only on basis of their “talent.”
The reasons for doing this, while officials admit that it at first sounds “immoral,” are simple. If the college isn’t bringing in enough money, then “the quality of education declines for everyone.” So, it makes the choice simple: Would you rather that you went to school with smarter peers or that you had a better education?
Colleges need to be honest with potential students. As a veteran of the application process, I know how hard it was to see letters in the mail that looked suspiciously paper-thin, especially from dream schools. The applications process is long, arduous, and, quite frankly, nerve-wracking enough already without the uncertainty about being refused admission because you checked off the box for financial aid. While some admissions officials have cited not wanting to scare people away from asking for financial aid as one of their main reasons for not addressing this issue, if I were applying for college now, I’d want to know what was going on.
Students put hard work into their applications for college, whether it’s answering all of those pesky “Supplemental Essays” that are tacked onto the Common Application or collecting just the right blend of recommendation letters from their teachers to show off their skills. They deserve to not be kept in the dark about why they weren’t offered admission, but rather informed beforehand of all the factors playing into selection.
As to various admissions departments’ fears: Would it really hurt to be more transparent to their application pool about admissions processes? While it’s always difficult being rejected from a college, hopeful students can cope with it better if they understand all the considerations that went into judging their application.
That is not to say that all hope is lost for those students without copious means or discretionary incomes. If the economic downturn continues, it will most likely mark the start of a trend wherein talented students begin to attend lesser-known or less prestigious schools, upping the competition for good grades there as well as keeping their bank accounts (mostly) in the black. That means graduating near the top of their class with little or no debt from student loans.
It will definitely be something to watch in the future: to see whether tomorrow’s leaders come from America’s most prestigious Ivies or from small colleges made famous by their presence. As for now, let’s hope college admissions offices become more honest about their selection processes and let the term “need-blind” really mean just that.

What stands out to you most from middle school? Playground games of tag, hopscotch, group skipping games, soccer perhaps, basketball, hide-and-seek — and girls, you probably remember the clapping games, you know, those ones accompanied by songs of dollies, boyfriends, and apple trees, whilst you feverishly clap as hard and fast as you can with the person opposite you: “My father went to sea, sea, sea, to see what he could see, see, see....”
These are the games that childhood memories are made of.
But now imagine if, when you were in middle school, all forms of physical contact were banned — and I’m not referring to just pushing, shoving, hitting, and punching. No, I’m asking you, what if ALL forms of physical contact were banned? Forbidden? A big fat no-no? What would your middle school memories consist of? What games would be played at recesses and lunch times? Bye-bye tag, group skipping games, soccer, basketball, hide-and-seek, and clapping games to songs of dollies, boyfriends, and apple trees.
Sounds utterly ridiculous, does it not? But this is the sad reality that the children of Connecticut’s East Shore Middle School are currently having to face since head teacher, Catherine Williams, put rules in place that prohibit any physical contact between the pupils, after a student was hospitalized when he was hit in the groin.
So, fair enough, recess isn’t always filled with these aforementioned happy and rosy games, as nostalgia would have us believe. In fact, the unfortunate grim reality is that playground violence is, undoubtedly, a growing problem in our schools, and subsequently proving to be a growing concern among middle school staff and parents. But placing a ban on all physical activity? Is this really a realistic and necessary way to handle the problem?
In a letter to all parents at the middle school, Williams stated, “Observed behaviors of concern recently exhibited include kicking others in the groin area, grabbing and touching of others in personal areas, hugging, and horseplay. Physical contact is prohibited to keep all students safe in the learning environment,” reports the Huffington Post. The letter continued, “Potential consequences and disciplinary action may include parent conferences, detention, suspension, and/or a request for expulsion from school.” This was news that outraged parents.
So let me get this straight, because, quite frankly, I just can’t get my head around it, and I’m pretty sure you’re having trouble, too. I’ve already declared anger at the fact that this rule eliminates nearly all, or at least the vast majority, of innocent, fun playground games, and that’s not to mention the complicated situation that gym class will become. But it’s more than that. Much, much more.
No hugging, no holding hands? Regardless of the question over whether this violates human rights, middle school is  where children learn the bulk of what they will take on into adult life. If all physical contact is banned and portrayed as a bad thing that will lead to expulsion, what is this teaching the kids? Let’s all tell our kids that cuddles are wrong. Yes, because that’s healthy.
Furthermore, we have to ask ourselves: Just what should kids be learning at school? Children spend more time at school than they do anywhere else, so it seems to me that it is crucial that school be not just a place of academic study, but it a place where children are taught important life skills, the difference between right and wrong, and the difference between proper/acceptable and improper/unacceptable human behavior.
And at no point in my life have I ever been told that hugging, playing, high-fiving and holding hands is by any means intolerable, improper, or unacceptable. What about team-building exercises, learning to work and play with others — can this be done without physical contact? I don’t think so.
And so this begs the question, just how much will this impact these children’s lives in the long run? It is not just fun and games that will be greatly reduced in their lives, but there will be a severe lack of affection, and what most would class as “normal” human interaction. How will this impact their attitudes and personalities later in life? Will it have positive outcomes? Unlikely.
The constant increase and popularity of game consoles and computer games is already a concern in today’s society, forcing us to ask how healthy this is for today’s generation of children. Children should be out playing on the streets with their friends instead of being cooped up in their house playing virtual games on their own, cry parents who remember the days when they would crowd the streets running, skipping, and playing hop-scotch. This exists much less in our streets today, but school is that place where children go and have no option but to play games that require interaction with other children. And Williams wants to take this away from the children at East Shore M.S.
So I’m asking you to be realistic about this, Ms. Williams. How on earth are teachers going to be able to implement this ridiculous new rule? Are they going to watch kids during recesses and lunches, taking note of every single child who reaches out and touches a classmate? It seems unlikely, and, well, completely unnecessary.
Why not just put all the kids in individual cells and provide them with hand-held game consoles during recesses? Yes, that’s a good idea. Let’s do that!
Aimee Beveridge (abeverid@) encourages everybody to go out and touch people. Because we can!

Too little, too late. That’s the unfortunate truth when it comes to foreign language education in the United States. In 2008, only 25 percent of elementary schools offered foreign language instruction, a decrease from gains made over the previous decade. When school budgets are slashed, foreign language programs are among the first to get cut. While high school foreign language programs are more common, it is more difficult for them to learn the language at that time. Frustrated, many students will give up and remain English-only speakers, becoming part of the growing population of Americans who has grown complacent in their monolingualism, believing that if they choose to travel abroad, “everyone will speak English.”
The United States is an anomaly among the vast majority of the world’s nations. Here, bilingualism or trilingualism is seen as a skill that only the most privileged residents have the opportunity to master. Meanwhile around the globe, it’s the norm for students to be learning one or even two other languages as early as elementary school. Students in Western European countries often learn English, French, and then a regional language; the vast majority of schoolchildren in Asia learn English as well as Mandarin Chinese in addition to their native Hindi, Japanese, or Korean; students in Central and South America learn English and Spanish alongside their indigenous tongue.
Meanwhile, the number of students enrolled in English as a Second Language (ESL) programs here in the U.S. has actually increased over the last decade, from 5.1 percent to 11 percent. When students from other countries enter the U.S., our education system demands they learn English right away. Yet schools don’t think it’s equally as critical for American students to reciprocate by learning some of the languages of their foreign-born peers. After high school or college, students can earn grants to travel to another country of their choice and teach English to the adults and children there. Are you sensing an imperialistic trend here?
While these students may feel that they have it easy now, their school systems are actually doing them a disservice by letting them graduate as monolingual. Globalization demands that successful businessmen and women speak at least one other language fluently in addition to their own. While the unofficial language of international business is English, the United States will simply not be able to compete on the same level as other world powers if American businessmen and women cannot communicate with at least some of their international partners in their native language.
But the need for multilingualism is growing at home as well. By 2025, whites will be the minority, as the U.S. grows increasingly diverse with more immigration from a wider variety of countries of origin. Still, the vast majority of American-born citizens remain monolingual.
Whatever the reason — xenophobia, stereotypes, or laziness — some folks would like to keep it that way. Known as the “English-only” movement, this group is pushing to have English declared as the only official language of the U.S. (the country currently has no official language) in an attempt to force out non-English-speaking residents.
The United States has prided itself on being a “melting pot” of citizens. Today, the descendants of those citizens would like to refuse this opportunity to other families exactly like theirs. The U.S. cannot truly welcome foreign immigrants if it cannot make an attempt to teach those immigrants’ native languages in our schools and use them in our workplaces. By doing so, we will be sending a message to residents of other nations that they are welcome here, just as Americans are welcomed (linguistically, anyway) in just about every other country in the world. The United States cannot be a melting pot of people unless it’s a melting pot of languages too, not just coexisting, but interacting with one another.
Claire Morgenstern (cmorgens@) speaks Spanish... sort of.

NASA had a contest to name the new node of the International Space Station last month. While NASA contests normally pass without even a yawn, this most recent competition became noteworthy when Stephen Colbert realized that the leading write-in candidate was Xenu, the dictator of Scientology’s “Galactic Confederacy.”
His obvious response was to ask the nation to write in his own name as a choice.
As you should have already guessed, Colbert dominated the competition with over 200,000 votes, beating all four of NASA’s official suggested choices: Serenity, Earthrise, Legacy, and Venture. NASA has not yet decided the final name for the new module, maintaining that the rules of the contest stipulated that they may choose any name, but they did state that the poll winners would receive serious consideration.
While we applaud NASA’s efforts to reach out and include people in their naming process, their choices were less than stellar. Unfortunately, judging from the suggestions that NASA originally had in mind, it seems unlikely that they will actually listen to the people they were trying to reach out to when they invited the public to vote.
Regardless of Colbert’s ability to compel his extensive fan base to do anything he bids, NASA should be prepared to accept the possibilities of how Internet contests can quickly be shifted by celebrities and public figures.
Because of Colbert, NASA and the ISS are getting far more news (including this opinion) than they would have if people had stuck to only voting for names as placid as Serenity and Earthrise, like NASA had originally suggested.
Maybe if NASA was only attempting to increase publicity about Node 3, Colbert’s naming campaign was the best possible outcome. However, if they were really just stuck and wanted people’s help choosing a name for the node, they might as well pick Colbert.

The United States is not the only country that has been affected by the recent economic downturn. Though we may sometimes get caught up in our Carnegie Mellon bubble and forget this fact, people in London certainly have not, as demonstrators took to the streets to show their anger toward the financial world during the Group of 20, or G20, summit meeting last week.
The G20 is a group of leaders from 19 nations with both industrialized and developing economies who gather to discuss important issues in the global economy.
While we realize that people are upset about the state of the economy right now (who isn’t?), we do not believe that the protestors went about expressing their anger in the right way. 
The point of a protest is to make others aware of your feelings and to show that there is something that needs to be changed. It seems pointless to demonstrate against the economy when it is no secret what people’s opinions are, especially when the group that you are protesting against is the group that is attempting to fix the problem. Regardless of whether or not the demonstrators were protesting against the leaders in attendance at G20, or they were rallying in support of what they were trying to fix, they only succeeded in adding to the pressure of an already tense situation.
There is some merit in protesting even when one’s feelings are already well-known — demonstrating is a way to feel like one is doing something for his/her case — if one is doing it peacefully, that is. This was not the case, however, during the G20 summit in London.
Bankers in London were warned of possible danger beforehand and were given a number of recommendations to help keep them safe — dress down, don’t leave the office early for meetings, and use public transportation if possible. Police were not unaware of the possibilities either — 37,000 police officers were placed on standby. 
And apparently, the caution was not unwarranted. The Daily Mail reported that rioters attacked the police on duty with missiles and also broke into the Royal Bank of Scotland, ripped out computers, and threw them at the officers. One man died in the chaos, and the demonstrators continued to harass the police by throwing bottles at them as they attempted to save the man’s life.  In addition, more than 100 people have been arrested as a result of their involvement in the riots.
The rioters in London went too far. It is one thing to protest to make your beliefs known, but to harm others in the process — and especially to hinder the police from saving a man’s life — is crossing the line. There is rarely a situation that calls for physical violence to let your views be known.

After Jennifer Church, the former Dean of Student Affairs, vacated her position in late 2008, the university began searching for a replacement, choosing Dick Tucker as the interim dean. The search committee has narrowed the selection down to four candidates, none of whom are from within Carnegie Mellon, offering the chance for a fresh perspective.
The administration isn’t making this decision by itself, however. It has invited the campus community to take part in the interview process with these candidates, affording students an opportunity to help select the best candidate to serve the affairs of students.
The student body, faculty, and staff, is invited to attend town hall-style meetings for each candidate. Questions are welcomed, and students have a chance to see how the candidates would respond to issues that are most important to them.
We think that this is a smart move from the administration, especially since the Dean of Student Affairs will interact the most with students and will be responsible for things students deal with most often, like housing, student health, and student activities.
Even though the administration is trying to collect opinions from the campus community at large, attendance at the town hall meetings has been disappointing thus far, showing a lack of concern from the community about the new dean. In order for the university’s attempts to receive feedback from the campus to be effective, more people need to respond to the administration’s invitation and attend the town hall meetings.
We hope that students, faculty, and staff will take this opportunity to help choose the new Dean of Student Affairs and give their input on both of the two candidates visiting this week.
When students are given the opportunity to question the candidates at the town hall meetings, they should keep in mind the qualities that would be important for a Dean of Student Affairs. In November, we expressed a desire to see a candidate who would communicate effectively with students, devote time to various groups on campus, and perhaps come from outside the university, reducing the risk of bias for or against certain departments or people.
We believe these traits are important to look for in a potential dean, and we encourage students to develop their own ideas about their ideal Dean of Student Affairs when formulating questions for the town hall meetings.
We encourage all students, faculty, and staff to attend the town hall meetings and to take advantage of their chance to help select the new dean. Meetings will take place in Rangos 3 at 4:45 p.m. today and tomorrow.

An active participant in the American College and University College Presidents Climate Commitment (ACUPCC) when I was president of Allegheny College, I would like to respond to the Jan. 19 letter from Dr. H. Scott Matthews, “PCC a weak attempt to decrease universities’ carbon footprints.”
It is not my purpose here to convince Carnegie Mellon to sign the ACUPCC but simply to clarify what the ACUPCC entails.
ACUPCC signatories understand that paths to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions will unfold only as technologies and circumstances evolve. Setting ambitious goals seldom involves knowing exactly how those goals will be reached — it is an aspirational act that leads innovation. The ACUPCC provides a framework with enough structure to ensure effective action and enough flexibility to allow each college and university to chart its own course and target date for carbon neutrality. I disagree that it is a “bad educational example” to set an ambitious goal and engage people in the creative process of achieving it — in fact that is at the core of leadership.
Rather than being a “10-step plan,” the ACUPCC is a pledge to create a climate action plan within two years and to take at least two of seven specified tangible actions during compilation of a greenhouse gas inventory and development of a plan to ensure near-term progress toward climate neutrality.
The earlier letter misses an important aspect of the ACUPCC — the collective action it represents, action that is opening up new opportunities and facilitating collaboration. It is also demonstrating critically needed leadership to the business community, the government, and the electorate.
I share Dr. Matthews’ disappointment that because Carnegie Mellon has chosen not to sign the ACUPCC at this time, some of Carnegie Mellon’s constituents are questioning the university’s commitment to sustainability. I commend Carnegie Mellon for its ongoing leadership and hope that when the time is right, that leadership will be leveraged as part of ACUPCC’s collective action — for the benefit of the network and the broader effort to address the climate challenge.
Richard J. Cook, President Emeritus, Allegheny College

Spring Carnival is just two short weeks away. The weather is getting warmer, the birds are chirping, the flowers are blooming, and large groups of people are gathering at odd hours of the weekend to send a small woman speeding down Schenley Drive in a torpedo-shaped vehicle. Yes, that last part is legal. No, they’re not insane. The sport is called Buggy, and it’s definitely one of the most unique extracurriculars in which Carnegie Mellon students choose to participate. What’s that you say — you’ve never heard of Buggy? That is precisely the reason I felt obliged to write this article.
Buggy is a long-standing Carnegie Mellon tradition, dating back to the 1920s. The easiest way to describe it is a combination of a soap-box derby and a relay race. Each buggy contains a petite driver who can steer and brake, and has a pusher who propels the buggy up the hill. Buggies start at the bottom of Tech Street. Near the top of the hill, the pusher passes the buggy to another pusher. They try to transfer all of their momentum to the buggy, sending it careening down Schenley Drive. Drivers roll freely to the bottom, where they make a sharp right turn onto Frew Street. Around Scaife Hall, another pusher “catches” the buggy to push it up this hill. The buggy will pass through the hands of two more pushers before reaching the finish line, and the fastest buggy around the course wins! Sound like fun? That’s because it is.
As chairman of Carnegie Involvement Association (CIA), an independent Buggy team, I have the privilege of experiencing the thrilling enthusiasm felt by all participants of buggy. Many team members spend large fractions of their free time building new buggies or preparing to race. Teams are also willing to wake up extremely early on Saturdays and Sundays in the spring and fall so that they can practice racing. Thousands of hours of preparation go into an intense two minutes of actual racing. So you can imagine my bewilderment when I hear one of my classmates say, “Buggy? What’s that?”
This article is my address to the campus community on behalf of all those who are passionate about Buggy. Now that you know about Buggy, come out to support the teams on April 17 and 18. You’ll be participating in a campus tradition and witnessing an event that can be seen nowhere else in the world! Races start at 9 a.m. and conclude at noon. It might be early, but turn on your alarm clock and head out to the Tech/Schenley/Frew loop on Friday and Saturday mornings during Carnival.

This is in response to the March 30 article, "Scientists create algorithm to help kidney transplants."
While the algorithms optimizing organ donation are enormously beneficial, without lifting restrictions on monetary compensation for donations the shortage of donors will continue. Bans on compensation for organ donation are essentially based on the anti-American principle of citizens being the property of the state, for if people are truly sovereign over themselves, they should be able to sell their liver (or any other part of their body).
