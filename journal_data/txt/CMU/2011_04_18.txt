“Managers are hired to be fired.” —Whitey Herzog
While Herzog’s quote is true in eventuality, a more succinct one would read: “Managers are scapegoats.”
Opening Day 2011 saw many teams entering the season with either a brand-new skipper or one in his first full season with the team, but the most important examples right now are Buck Showalter, Clint Hurdle, and Terry Collins. Showalter took over the Baltimore Orioles last August and provided just the spark and strategy that Dave Trembley most definitely had not for the majority of the year. Showalter managed to lead the team to more wins in the season’s final two months (34) than it had had in the first four (32). The Orioles’ late-season success seemed to spill over into 2011, when the club started off 6–1, but a five-game losing streak entering the weekend has provided the team’s first true adversity under Showalter’s guidance.
Showalter’s success at the end of last season afforded the Pittsburgh Pirates the opportunity to overtake them as the worst team in baseball —and they took full advantage of it. In an eerie (read: sad) coincidence, the Bucs finished last season with 57 wins and 105 losses, or the number of games the Orioles played under Showalter and Trembley, respectively. Following the season, the Pirates did what any team would do: they fired their manager. The saying goes that you fire the manager because you can’t fire the team; in this case, the Pirates fired their manager because they couldn’t fire their owner and couldn’t undo the damage done by former general manager Dave Littlefield.
So, instead, the blame for the Pirates’ 18th straight losing season, with the team’s lowest win total since the strike-shortened 1994 season and lowest overall winning percentage since 1954, fell on manager John Russell, who in all fairness did not get the most out of the talent he had to work with. New manager Clint Hurdle certainly has his work cut out for him, and after starting off the year with a record hovering around the .500 mark, it’s easy to find positives in Hurdle’s young first season in Pittsburgh. The team has been playing better overall baseball than it did at any point last year and has shown resilience and moderate consistency that has not been seen in a long while. That said, it’s always easy to find positives in a team that would easily win Hurdle a Manager of the Year award merely with a non-losing season.
Then there is Collins, hired to take over a talented but dismal New York Mets team that, after being haunted by collapses, failed to even give their fans hope each of the past two years. Collins was brought in after the Mets fired former manager Jerry Manuel, who was brought in after they fired Willie Randolph, who certainly found far more success in his Mets tenure than his successor or his predecessor, the awful Art Howe. Manuel was frequently berated by fans and media for a lack of fire, which had been Randolph’s issue as well, and Collins brought with him a history of almost too much fire.
The Mets also tried to buck Herzog’s old adage by firing their team — or, at least, the two most expensively unproductive members, Oliver Perez and Luis Castillo. Unfortunately, after an encouraging Spring Training and a decent 3–1 start to the year, the Mets have punched their fans and Collins in the stomach night after night, consistently taking leads and then blowing games day in and day out.
For a team with the Mets’ payroll and expectations, it’s tough to find positives in their season so far. Perhaps Jose Reyes, who has been on a tear, or recovering former star pitchers Chris Young and Chris Capuano, each experiencing some success in their first two starts, can provide that silver lining, but beyond that, the only consistency that the team has shown is its ability to disappoint without fail. For Mets fans, front office members, coaches, players, and manager alike, the only way to find positives in this season, and in Collins’ ability to manage, is to actually have success — pure, unadulterated success — and starting off the year 4–9 is not the way to do it.
The season is still young, though, and fans must remember that the World Champion 1969 Mets began the year 6–11 and were five games under .500 at multiple points early in the season. The team is one 11-game winning streak away from great success.
But there are no guarantees, and if this keeps up for another year, it looks like the front office will be plum out of time to find positives in Collins, and firing the team will once again not be an option.

Senior chemical and biomedical engineering major Laura McKee has been a consistently strong member of the Carnegie Mellon cross country and track and field teams this past year. Having been part of both teams for four years now, she made it her aim to reach all of her goals by graduation this year.
Beginning cross country during her freshman year of high school, McKee found herself enjoying the running aspect, as well as the team atmosphere. Thus, when presented with the opportunity to continue running in college, she pursued her love for the sport, as well as the strong engineering program, offered at Carnegie Mellon.
After four years of involvement with the sport, she finds herself leading the team in the captain position, noting, “I have learned that patience really pays off, whether you are talking in terms of racing in a pack or being captain.” Her leadership has positively impacted the team this year, for they have runners in every event finishing within the top five performances in school history. She aims to lead the team to reach UAA level, and eventually place within their conference there.
McKee realized early on the importance of time management when it came to balancing school and a varsity sport at Carnegie Mellon. However, having experience with sports from high school, she was used to always being busy and thus managing her time wisely. She said, “I have had to learn how to maintain a normal sleep schedule through tough academic schedules. Sleep has a huge impact on athletic performance.”
Over her four years of involvement with cross country, McKee has learned numerous lessons from the sport, as well as shared memorable times with fellow teammates. “My best moments have come with my teammates when we have been fortunate enough to break and then re-break some of the school’s relay records,” she said. McKee aims to qualify for nationals this year in the 1,500-meter race specifically, and finds herself looking to the comfort of chocolate frosting and the support of teammates when matters get overwhelming.

The Carnegie Mellon track and field team traveled to Wilmington, Pa., to compete in the Westminster Invitational. The men’s team placed fourth, while the women’s team finished sixth out of the 13 teams that competed.
“It was a tough meet because it was cold and rainy all day, but everyone stuck it out and we did have some great performances. In particular, junior Lisa Marion Garcia set the new school record in the pole vault,” junior Luci Laffitte said. Garcia set a new record with a height of 3.10 meters.
Two other notable performances came from senior Melissa Hwang, who placed second in two events. First was the long jump with a distance of 4.79 meters and then the triple jump with a distance of 10.52 meters. On the track, first-year Jacqueline Guevel finished strong, adding another second-place finish for the team in the 400-meter run with a time of 1:00.23.
On the men’s side, senior Dustin Musselman brought a first place finish to the Tartans in the javelin with a distance of 47.85 meters.
Other notable performances on the field came from first-year Nathan Cheek and first-year Zachary Erra-Hernandez. Cheek came in second in the discus throw with a distance of 39.84 meters. Erra-Hernandez placed third in the discus throw with 38.35, just falling short of Cheek. Erra-Hernandez also placed third in the shot put. On the track, sophomore Noel Titus had a strong showing as he came in first in the 200-meter race with a time of 22.91 seconds. First-year Tim Kikta finished fifth, although he was barely a second behind Titus. The 800-meter men finished with sophomore Ben Nealy in second with a time of 2:01.44 followed by first-year James Allen in fourth and senior John Briguglio in fifth with times of 2:02.17 and 2:02.35, respectively.
Next Thursday, the track and field team will pack their bags and travel to Atlanta, Ga. to compete in the 2011 Outdoor UAA Track and Field Championships, which are hosted by Emory University.

Never has one player captured the attention of baseball fans more than Manny Ramirez. Throughout the years, we’ve seen Manny take bathroom breaks in between outs, somersault in the outfield, and blatantly tank games, but we’ve also seen him have an illustrious career at the plate, as he is widely considered to be one of the best right-handed hitters of all time.  He’s been on five different teams, yet he will always be remembered for his days in a Red Sox uniform, where he turned around a cursed franchise to help it win its first World Series in 86 years.  
Unfortunately, it looks like Manny Ramirez’s storied career will come to end on a sour note, as he has decided to retire instead of facing a 100-game suspension for testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs for the second time in his career.  The past few years have been extremely disappointing for the 12-time All Star, as he was shipped out of Boston because of his attitude. 
At the end of his stay in Boston, he was better known for tanking than for hitting home runs. He made his way to Los Angeles, where he brought the Dodgers to the playoffs while posting a 1.200+ OPS.  However, it was downhill from there. Although he signed just last summer with the Rays to a one-year deal that would make him the Rays’ starting DH, he soon tested positive for steroids once again.
Although he was a great hitter, many people will remember Manny for his on- and off-field antics. He is probably one of the most ridiculous players ever to play the game, and that reputation was definitely well-deserved.  During a mound visit in the middle of an inning, Manny decided to take a bathroom break in the wall at Fenway Park behind left field, and only appeared as the next pitch was being released. 
In another game, Manny inexplicably cut off fellow outfielder Johnny Damon’s throw into the infield.  Normally, a cutoff is a good thing, but not when the person cutting the ball off is literally 10 feet away from you. Manny was always full of fun and laughs, but nothing he did ever surprised anyone.
Without Manny, the 2004 Red Sox, known as “The Idiots,” could have potentially taken on a different clubhouse feel and not been as loose throughout the playoffs to capture that historic championship.
So, what is the legacy that Manny leaves behind? Is it the player whom every pitcher feared, the one with the 555 career home runs, 1,831 career RBIs, and a .312 career batting average? Those numbers rank Manny near the top of the all-time leaders, among baseball greats such as Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron, and Willie Mays. However, Manny also leaves a ton of doubt in the eyes of the fans and the Hall of Fame voters, as this is the second time he has been suspended for drug use, and more than the third time he has been accused. The 2004 Boston Red Sox championship run has been tainted by steroid use, and there are many who doubt that any of the home run hitters that dominated the so-called “Steroid Era” will even come close to the Hall of Fame. We have seen the likes of Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, and Rafael Palmeiro all miserably fail in the Hall of Fame voting, and at this point Manny will most likely follow in their footsteps.  
It’s unfortunate that we have to remember this great player as a “cheater” and a “steroid user,” but that’s the way it goes in professional baseball today. Being a Yankees fan, I never liked Manny, but I always admired his abilities and his attitude toward the game, and it is sad that he will probably not become a hall-of-famer. Now, we move on from one of the greatest hitters of our era, and in about 10 years, he may just be forgotten.

Professor Jeff Galak, an assistant professor of marketing in the Tepper School of Business, studies the psychological basis of marketing. He works with research on consumer behavior and heads the Consumer Behavior Lab, which involves a collection of online studies. The lab looks at many domains of consumption such as consumer enjoyment, hedonic adaptation, and variety seeking. His primary research focus, however, is in satiation and what brings about consumer enjoyment.
A study from Psychological Review defines satiation as the state when buyers have consumed items to the point where they no longer enjoy them. In Galak’s words, satiation is the “way in which an enjoyable experience becomes less enjoyable over time.” Studying satiation is very useful in the marketing world as it allows for advertisers to know at what point the consumer may not like their product. Galak and colleagues had their work published by the American Psychological Association, concluding that, “The prospect of repeating an experience can, in fact, change how people remember it.”
In an interview with Galak, he explained that there are two traditional theories on satiation, using the example of fullness. On one end, there is the physiological basis. There are cues in your body, he explained, such as blood pressure or stomach distention. These cues are physical indications that you are full, so you do not enjoy food as much. However there is also the psychologically based theory of habituation, where “you observe that you have eaten x amount of food and [are] so full so you enjoy it less over time.” The difference is mainly in that your body is telling you that you are full, physiologically, and then your mind is telling you that you are full, psychologically.
Galak is studying a third theory which he calls self-reflective satiation, describing it as, “how you observe your consumption experience.” He explains this theory by using music as an example. It is a well observed phenomenon that variety makes people less bored or less satiated. If you keep listening to a song again and again, you may stop enjoying the song. However, if you listen to a variety of songs, you may not become as bored. Galak agrees that this variety of music may keep you from getting bored, but there is still a problem. For example, if you listen to a band a lot all at once and then stop to listen to other songs for the next weeks, Galak explained that you have to remind yourself of the variety of the songs you have heard. Perhaps you then may remember that you actually liked the band in the first place.
To illustrate this theory better, Galak discussed one of his own experiments. Subjects wre asked to pick their favorite song from the top-10 Billboard charts. They then listen to the same song over and over until they indicate they are tired of it. Several weeks later, the subjects are asked to listen to the song again, but this time, they are asked either to think about the variety of songs they listened to in those weeks or not. If they reflect on the variety of the songs they listened to, the subjects showed signs of liking the song as much as they did the first time they listened to it. If they don’t reflect on the intermittent songs, they show no changes in their displeased feelings towards the song. Galak summed it up by saying, “Satiation is this self-reflective. It isn’t just about the variety; it is about reflecting on it which doesn’t happen by default.”
This is quite interesting because it offers us as students a different way of looking at things we like or dislike. Let us take an example: Suppose we studied a novel in high school and over-analyzed it so much that we ended up “hating” it, and then we were asked to study it again for a class. We could think about all the books we have read since the first time we read that novel and our perception of the novel may now be different than it was the first time we read the novel. This is interesting as it may not be how we generally look at things. Perhaps this is a pleasurable change we could make in our ways of thinking.

As video games continue to become more popular, the market for a more diverse selection of games has spurred increased development of educational games. Popular titles such as Brain Age help users keep their minds sharp and hone math or logic skills. One Carnegie Mellon Ph.D. candidate in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII), Derek Lomas, is the next promising developer of games with educational purposes. 
Lomas has a five-year fellowship with the Program for Interdisciplinary Education Research (PIER) in HCII, and strives to create efficient educational software for underprivileged youth. Together with his collaborators Dixie Ching of New York University and Jeanine Sun of the University of California at San Diego, the team recently won the $50,000 National STEM Video Game Challenge Prize for their game, NumberPower: Numbaland!. United States Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra awarded the prize to the team as part of President Obama’s “Educate to Innovate” Campaign a few weeks ago.
In a White House press release, Chopra wrote, “As the President noted earlier this month when announcing the new ARPA [Advanced Research Projects Agency] for Education, this Administration is committed to harnessing the best ideas from the public, private, academic, and philanthropic sectors to deliver an educational system that ensures we can win the future.” In an article from the Sesame Workshop, he added, “It is efforts like these that will ensure our nation’s continued economic and technological leadership well into the 21st century.”
Similar to games such as Mario Party or WarioWare, where the player can choose from several different minigames to play, Numbaland! offers five different number-based games, each designed to hone a particular math skill. The core of Lomas’ research is to improve what he calls “number sense,” which is basic intuition and understanding of mathematical concepts. “If you don’t understand what numbers mean, [it is] harder to understand why math works; you are at a loss to self-explain things to yourself. It correlates with overall high math achievement,” he said. One minigame titled “Battleship Numberline” aims to help kids understand the relationship between number magnitudes and different number forms such as decimals or fractions. In one setting, an animated battleship is positioned between two white flags marked “0” and “1.” The player then must enter in a decimal that he or she thinks represents the actual location of the ship.
“We want to systematically investigate the design decisions in the games we make. There are lots of different ways to display feedback, different ways to sequence the instructions, lots of different aesthetics, and there is even the question of whether it should be a task to begin with,” Lomas said. He and his team created several versions of their games to investigate which version helps children learn the most efficiently. In one game, they found children can improve their number sense after only 20 minutes of play. In the coming months, Lomas and his team expect to launch versions of Numbaland! for the iPad and iPod touch platforms, but currently the games run solely on computers. He hopes to put some of his prize money into making his games marketable and eventually self-sustaining.
The next step in development is to “integrate” these minigames together. To better test how people react to video games and “systematize” how data is collected, Lomas hopes that part of his prize money can be invested in better facilities, an example being a larger and more organized “video game room.” Lomas also mentioned several open research opportunities for eager students. Another facet of research involves gender discrepancies. “It’s sometimes easier to make games for boys, like our ‘Battleship Numberline,’ but we struggle to make games that are not necessarily gender-neutral, but appealing to both sexes,” he said.
This summer, Lomas and his team are going to work with underprivileged youth in after-school centers and summer programs to better understand the scaffolds of game play. He said that his life’s work was inspired by the experiences he had during an internship he had with Qualcomm in Mumbai, India. “There’s so much economic disparity and so much demand in [the] emerging middle class. There is a population the size of America that makes between $80 and $100 a month ... and the government educational systems are really poor. The missing piece is the content, as there has been very little educational content that has been proven effective.” Lomas and his team are doing their best to close that gap.

You may have used it on your laptop to watch Rebecca Black’s sensational YouTube music video “Friday,” your friends are likely currently using it in their Android phones, and Apple might even cave in and decide to use it in future iOS devices. One should know what it is, folks: Adobe Flash.
The ability to play Adobe Flash content is a feature some would argue a modern-day browser cannot do without. While this is certainly a subjective stance on the matter, there is no question that Flash content affects a huge number of people every day. According to a September 2009 study conducted by the UK-based consumer market research organization Milward Brown, Flash content reaches 99 percent of Internet viewers, making it the “rich Internet application” with the highest penetration rate, ahead of similar competitors like HTML5, Oracle’s Java, and Microsoft’s Silverlight.
Colloquially, the term “Flash” can refer to the Adobe Flash Professional authoring tool, the Adobe Flash Player, or the collection of different file types associated with videos or animations stored as Flash files. Adobe Flash, as in the authoring tool, is a special type of computer software developed by Adobe (available for Windows and Mac) that allows developers to create these types of videos and animations. The software presents its users with various image editing capabilities, a timeline viewer, picture and sound import options, and even its own programming language, called ActionScript. Newcomers to Flash who only wish to create basic animations may find all they need within the image editing toolkit and timeline editor. More advanced users seeking to create games or multi-paged Flash websites may require a more complicated combination of the vast array of tools built into Flash.
Flash Player is essentially the software that lets you view and interact with Flash videos and animations (collectively known as Flash files). A typical Flash file is stored as a .SWF (pronounced “swiff” by some) and contains byte code meant to be interpreted by the virtual machine that runs within Flash Player. While the player is created and compiled differently across different operating systems and CPU architectures, the same interpretation occurs, resulting in a largely universal Flash experience. 
Most Internet browsers require that you download a Flash Player plugin if you want to view Flash content, though a few browsers (notably Google Chrome) eschew this step by embedding a Flash Player within newer releases. As Adobe has repeatedly stated that the source code for Flash Player is closed-source (meaning that it is kept in-house and not released to the public), some users opt to use open-source alternative Flash players to reinforce their convictions in the greater good of open source software, albeit at a noticeable performance and compatibility cost. 
Once a user has developed a Flash file, he or she can opt to either save it to local storage media or store it away on a remote server. Sometimes the Flash file will embed videos meant to be served dynamically from a remote server to an end-user. Flash video files, usually in .FLV format, can consist of audio, video, and text files, and an end-user’s on-demand access to this type of data (without having to wait for the entire file to download first) is known as “streaming.”
Just like your web browser, Flash Player is able to maintain its own separate cache storage, which means that .SWF, Flash video, and other Flash content you’ve accessed in the past can be stored to your computer’s hard drive for quick retrieval the next time you decide to access the same information. Flash Player keeps itself independent from the web browsers you use, so if you have multiple browsers installed on your computer, you may notice that your Flash Player cache and other settings carry over from browser to browser.
Proponents of the growing HTML5 user base argue that Flash Player has several performance issues on certain platforms, and that it also negatively impacts battery life on mobile devices. It is true that earlier versions of Flash Player did not support Graphics Processing Unit (or GPU) acceleration, a method of utilizing your computer’s graphics card to compute complex floating-point calculations. But according to Adobe, recent versions of Flash Player (starting with version 10.1) have added GPU acceleration support for newer graphics cards, meaning that your computer’s processor won’t struggle as much playing Flash files. GPU acceleration also means that certain content will look better when rendered in newer versions of Flash Player. Battery life still remains an issue however, and is one of the reasons why Apple still refuses to support Flash in their hugely popular iOS devices. The most recent, stable release of Adobe Flash Player is version 10.2, and is available for download at get.adobe.com.

New sensor to determine food safety
Research at the Fraunhofer Institution in Munich have made a polymer film that can react with meat to change colors from bright blue to bright yellow when it is in contact with meat that has gone bad. The polymer film works by reacting with biogenic amines that are secreted from rotten meat, resulting in a color change. The researchers want to incorporate it into supermarket packaging to increase food safety without increasing the value of packaging.

Study has found adverse effects of nitrogen fertilizer
At a conference in Edinburgh, researchers have determined that there are traces of nitrogen in half of the examined meat portions. They estimated the annual cost of damage caused by nitrogen pollution across Europe is between 70 to 320 billion euros. Nitrogen is currently used as fertilizer to grow crops, but poses a human threat when nitrogen-based toxins are released into the atmosphere.

Nanotechnology allows faster charging batteries
Researchers have a found a new way to decrease the amount of time to charge rechargeable batteries by using nanomaterials. They have made a highly porous metal foam coated with a large amount of active battery material that provides high electrical conductivity, and so the structure holds enough active material to store the energy.

Alzheimer’s shrinks brains 10 years before diagnosis
Brain scans of healthy people showed signs that the brain was shrinking in Alzheimer’s affected areas nearly a decade before the disease was diagnosed. In the study, 50 participants appeared cognitively normal, while 15 patients developed Alzheimer’s disease. People with the high amount of shrinkage in specific areas of the cerebral cortex were three times more likely to develop the disease.

Nature produces its own barcodes in zebras
Animal researchers like to track their subjects to learn more about their migration pattern. Recently, they have found that each zebra carries its own unique “barcode” — their stripes, or their “StripeCode.” The researchers have created an open source software called StripeSpotter that is a database of stripe patterns and matches stripes to a specific zebra.

The preliminary races of the 92nd annual sweepstakes competition occurred last Friday, one of the most enduring traditions of Carnegie Mellon culture. Teams from 11 different organizations, classmates, alumni, and Pittsburgh community members began gathering around Tech Street and Frew Street early in the morning to prepare for the event. Months of grueling early morning practices culminated in the seven women's heats and ten men's heats that began at 8:10 a.m. and lasted until 12:30 p.m. Fringe A was the official winners of the men's races and SDC A the official winners of the women's races
The problems that had plagued the women's heats last year were noticeably absent, with only one team not completing the race and two teams disqualified. Spirit A, racing their new buggy Mamapbazuko, spun out in the third heat after starting off with a strong lead over CIA B and Student Dormitory Council (SDC) C, both of which qualified for the final races. Disappointing as it was for the teams which didn't make it to the finals, this result wasn't unforeseen; as WRCT's announcers explained, practice runs were plagued by troubles in the chute. Sigma Phi Epsilon B was disqualified in the fourth heat and Alpha Epsilon Pi A was disqualified in the fifth heat for a handlebar violation. Neither of these had any bearing on the final results. SigEp redeemed themselves in the final heat when their A team finished with a final time of 2:50, which qualified them for the finals.
The last women's heat was one of the most suspenseful races of the day. While SDC A had originally finished the race with a time of 2:30, which left the team in first place, the entire heat had to be re-rolled due to the officials accidentally signaling a false start. In order to maintain their first place rank, the team had to finish under 2:35.075. Despite their strong initial run, they finished on the cusp of 2:35, leaving spectators wondering whether they would indeed keep their position as first place team. After several minutes of tense waiting, the officials announced the final time as 2:34.963. 
The men's teams were not so lucky. Disqualifications and technical difficulties took out 11 of the 29 teams, including a particularly bad crash between Sigma Nu A and AEPi A in the ninth heat that resulted in the event being called to a standstill to wait for an ambulance to arrive. Like their female teammates, Spirit's teams were plagued by troubles in the chute with two of their four teams spinning out. However, their A and B teams both qualified for finals. Spirit A was especially well-received by the audience after their Hill 2 pusher, sophomore mechanical engineering major Ben Antoine, followed up his push into the chute with a somersault. 
For the most part, however, the hours of preparation paid off for this year's teams. The competition was rough and suspenseful and while there were favorites, there was no clear winner until the very last heat. The most favorably predicted teams were SDC A, Fringe A, and PiKA A. SDC A was the favorite to win, Fringe A had high expectations with their new buggy, Bonsai, and PiKA A was looking to compensate for their poor performance last year. PiKA A clocked in at 2:08.37 in the eighth heat, which put them at third place in the standings. However, they were disqualified for violating the five second rule — according to the Sweepstakes by-laws, "after the starter announces that there are ﬁve seconds remaining to the start of a heat, nobody except the drivers and Hill 1 pushers of the entries in that heat, and the starter, may be within ﬁve feet of any of the buggies in that heat, until that heat begins." PiKA's team was disqualified for being away from the buggy for only four and a half seconds. When asked about the five second rule, PiKA's Sweepstakes Chair, senior mechanical and biomedical engineering major Keshav Raghavan, said, "I mean, overall the rule is pretty black and white.... I do think one thing maybe in the future is that the spirit of the rule is not to disqualify teams.... There needs to be a more fair system of disqualification because it shouldn't be an all-or-nothing type of thing."
Fringe A, the only team in the ninth heat to finish due to the SigNu A and AEPi A crash, looked as if it was going to beat the record time for men, which was set at 2:03.30 by SDC in 2009. While that record remains to be broken, Bonsai's performance certainly validated all of the hype attributed to it with a time of 2:05.08. The final heat, which featured SDC A, CIA A, and SigEp B, was the perfect end to the day's races. SDC held a significant lead throughout the race and nearly matched Fringe A's time. The time was too close to call by eye, but after several minutes of anticipation the official scoreboard had SDC A's time listed as 2:06.189. 
Unfortunately, heavy rain throughout the night and early morning resulted in the cancellation of the finals, leaving Fringe A the official winners of the men's races and SDC A the official winners of the women's races. At the conclusion of the events, spectators and competitors alike were pleased with the results. "It was cool to see the culmination of a year of hard work," spectator Tanner Whyte, a first-year electrical and computer engineering major, said. "It was definitely worth getting up early to watch."

Every year during the week leading up to Carnival, hordes of students spend their days and nights in the Morewood Gardens parking lot, otherwise known as Midway, feverishly assembling booths for their organizations. This year, the theme for Carnival was “When I Was Your Age,” and the organizations stepped up to the challenge, creating booths that had attendees reminiscing about their childhood.
Rain throughout the beginning of the week and stricter safety standards slowed down Booth construction. Everyone on Midway was required to wear a hard hat, and several organizations were forced to rebuild their booths to meet the safety requirements, which kept some organizations from completing their booths on time. Despite the setbacks, the results were still impressive.
Sigma Phi Epsilon won first place in the Fraternities category with its booth, “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.” When visitors first walked into the booth, they immediately got the impression that they were underground in the sewers, with a spigot pouring out green water. SigEp’s game was a Wii skateboarding game that brothers had coded with ninja turtles as the characters in the game.
Delta Tau Delta won second place in the Fraternities category for its booth, “Harry Potter and the Deltly Hallows.” The booth had Quidditch goal posts that spelled out DTD on the outside, and plenty of interesting facts about Harry Potter on the inside of the booth. Alpha Epsilon Pi won third place, even though its booth wasn’t finished by the time Midway opened. The booth’s theme was “When I Was Your Age, I Had To Walk Uphill Both Ways”; it was intended to be M.C. Escher-themed, but was sparsely decorated on the inside.
In the Sororities category, Kappa Alpha Theta won first place with “The KAT in the Hat.” Despite what its booth’s name implied, the sorority’s booth referenced plenty of other Dr. Seuss books, including The Lorax, One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish, and Oh, The Places You’ll Go! Each room had a theme from one of the Seuss stories, and contained plenty of impressive art and bright colors.
Delta Gamma’s “POOH BEAR” booth, which won second place, contained touching details from the beloved story, including Winnie the Pooh’s honey pots, a papier-mâché Tigger, and paintings of Pooh and his friends playing together. Kappa Kappa Gamma’s booth, titled “Kappa Kosmic Galaxy,” won third place for depicting a child’s dream of being an astronaut. Its booth included a game where visitors had to correctly identify constellations that lit up.
The Taiwanese Student Association won first place in the Independent Organizations category for its Oregon Trail-themed booth. Each room had a slightly different theme; in the first, the wood was stained to resemble a Wild West saloon, while the second had an enormous papier-mâché horse with a sand floor. One highlight of this booth was a “wheel of misfortune,” which told the wheel’s spinners what misfortunes might befall them, the options ranging from dysentery to a broken wheel axle.
Second place went to the Asian Student Association for its “Toy Story” booth. That booth, which was only a one-story structure with high ceilings, had incredible detail, with paintings of characters from all three movies on the walls. The first room was Sunnyside Daycare from Toy Story 3, complete with Ken and Barbie’s dream house and a giant stuffed plush Lotso. The Singapore Student Association won third place, with the theme “Retro Lounge.” It focused on the ’60s, ’70s, and ’80s, with homages to Woodstock and Michael Jackson and a Berlin Wall that visitors could sign.
First place in the Blitz category went to Alpha Kappa Psi, for whom this was the first year participating in Booth. AKPsi’s booth was “Monopoly”-themed; its whole booth was a board game, where visitors had to roll oversized dice and answer trivia questions about Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon to win Monopoly money. Student Dormitory Council’s “SDC and the Purple Crayon” booth won second place and contained an enormous white board that visitors could write on. BioSAC’s booth, which was themed “Brontosaurus Was a Dinosaur,” focused on dinosaurs and included a “spin the wheel” game.
Not every organization put a full week’s worth of effort into Booth: Kappa Sigma’s “Build-A-Booth” consisted of nothing more than painted cardboard boxes on a platform that people could then rearrange to build structures. Despite its simplicity, children and students alike highly enjoyed the booth, building different structures out of the boxes.
Another well-received addition to Booth was Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s “Bluth’s Banana Stand,” an homage to the television show Arrested Development. The booth, which sold frozen bananas, was a near-perfect replica of the banana stand on the television show, and was incredibly popular — SAE sold out of frozen bananas long before Carnival ended.
This year’s Booth had a wide range of themes and activities that, despite early setbacks, made it a success.

Carnival brought a lot of things to Carnegie Mellon University – Booth, flea markets, rides, food stalls, games with stuffed toys for winners, warm and sunny weather, girls in skirts and shorts once again, frat boys out of their houses, geeks out of the library, Pitt students from a couple of blocks away — and one comedian all the way from Kansas. So who was this guy standing on a newly built platform in a shiny peach tracksuit pretending to be all that? It was none other than Eddie Griffin.
On Friday night, Carnival got a lot more than its usual dose of fun and entertainment as comedian Eddie Griffin hit the stage. Organized by the Activities Board Comedy, this show turned out to be a memorable one. By 7 p.m. there was a long queue of students waiting to watch Griffin perform. Although Griffin reached Carnegie Mellon a little after 8 p.m, the time gap left students even more anxious and excited to watch him. After the buildup, Griffin entered holding a glass of champagne and asked for refills repeatedly throughout his performance but maintained that college students were not allowed to drink. He covered a wide range of topics, from legalizing marijuana, to the Obamas, to obituary columns. But he maintained his signature style and stuck to racist and sexist jokes, and expected the audience to take them in good humor. Griffin also involved members of the audience and made them part of his gimmick. He teased almost everyone present from the old people in the front row, to the young students at the back, to the policemen on the sides, and even the students who were standing outside the tent hoping to catch a glimpse of his performance. But it made the audience crack up, and that was the entire point of the show. Dan Ladenheim, an information systems and human computer interaction major and an organizer of the show, said, “I think his stand-up is great, and I thought it was hilarious the way he interacted with the audience. You’re never supposed to sit in the front of a comedy show unless you’re prepared to get made fun of, and Eddie proved that true.”
So what did Carnegie Mellon think of his performance? Michelle Berman, a sophomore economics and statistics major, said, “Although I haven’t seen Eddie Griffin perform previously, I was excited as many people have told me previously that he is hysterical.” But with the kind of jokes Griffin made, some students booed, and even cringed. As Berman said, “I enjoyed the show; however at times I was concerned as to what more conservative people in the crowd were feeling.” On a similar vein, Aashish Jindia, a first-year computer science major, said, “Griffin was really funny in the beginning and I felt as if the show was a lot of fun. But then he got kind of drunk and started cracking jokes that were not in good humor.” Many people in the crowd felt that he should have left once he hit the one hour mark, as his jokes became far too crude toward the end.
Ladenheim said, “The content of the show was definitely for mature audiences, but we were prepared for that. All alumni who got tickets were told about this in advance, the onsite line management crew were looking for kids to warn their parents, and on top of that we printed and laminated about 20 warning signs. I don’t believe the content was overall a bad thing. It’s a part of Eddie’s personality and his culture, which is everything in a comedian. And in the end, it’s important to remember that this is a comedy show. Everything is really just a joke.”
Aditya Goyal, a sophomore statistics and economics major, said, “I think it was a good change to see an artist like Eddie Griffin come to CMU — [it was] something unique after last year. Unfortunately, however, keeping with the crowd, it felt like he may have upset a large audience of both parents, elderly, and also the LGBT community. The show could have been better if there was more sensitivity both to CMU administration and possible members of the crowd present, but on the whole it was a good show.”
Landenheim said, “We made a good choice to bring Eddie Griffin. He actually wasn’t our first choice, but I’m still really happy we got him. He has a very different style than some comedians we’ve had in the past such as Michael and Michael, and it’s important to bring these different styles so you can appeal to all audiences. Obviously in a school of over 5,000 people you can’t please everyone with one show, so we try our best to do that over a few years.”
Ladenheim added, “I was happy that we were able to fill the tent up, but to be honest, the comedy show is always that packed. It’s more important to us that people enjoy the show.”

Re-engineering Lewis Carroll’s classic tale Alice in Wonderland, the final play of the School of Drama’s 2010–11 season, The Alice Project, debuted last Thursday, April 14, at the Philip Chosky Theater. The Alice Project thrusts the timeless story of Alice in Wonderland into the spotlight of twenty-first century technology. In this twisted marriage of art and machinery, Alice explores what it is to be human in a world that is a far stretch from Victorian England.
The Alice Project ponders the existential question: Who is Alice? The play leaves that up for question. At one point, Alice even forgets her own identity, before remembering that she is, in fact, a human girl. As Alice moves from square to square in attempt to become a queen, different characters perceive her in different ways. However, no one way seems to correctly identify who she is.
A play within a play, the story begins with the writers of The Alice Project interviewing Alice in an attempt to discover her personality and motives. While Alice says that she is home-schooled, has a governess, and appears to live in Pittsburgh, there is an ethereal quality about her that suggests otherwise. As one of the writers begins to read aloud from a book about Alice, the story changes to follow the narrative and suddenly the audience is watching the story of Alice herself, as she tumbles through Wonderland. Alice is played by four different actors: senior drama students Krista Marie Yu, Sara Trapnell, Evan Barron, and Tess Primack, who are able to act almost interchangeably, through the exchange of Alice’s iconic hair-ribbon, as the “real” Alice throughout the production.
The juxtaposition of man and machine was an integral part of the performance. Notably, instead of a pit orchestra, there was a tech crew seated beneath the stage, orchestrating the complex visuals in each scene. Offsetting the changing digital backgrounds, the story used a three-tiered, metal, chess-like stage set in order to loosely tie together the story arcs. As Alice navigates from one square to the next, the story also progresses in different directions.
The combination of acting and live-action recording via the video cameras onstage produced a novel storytelling effect. Depending on one’s opinion, it created either a connection or a barrier for the characters, many of whom spoke primarily into video cameras in order to interact with the different characters onstage on different squares.
Trapnell, one of the Alices in the performance, spoke about The Alice Project after the show. “It’s been a really cool and interesting process,” Trapnell said. “Working on The Alice Project was challenging in a good way. We had to learn how to act with the cameras as if we were acting to someone. Physically it was also challenging, because there was a lot of climbing around the sets in practice. The Alice Project was a lot of fun to prepare and it is so exciting to see it all come together now onstage.”
The Alice Project is playing from April 14 through 23 at the Philip Chosky Theater. Tickets can be purchased via the School of Drama box office, or online at www.drama.cmu.edu

Carnival is usually an upbeat weekend, as students celebrate their days off from school and cheer on their classmates in Sweepstakes. Scotch’n’Soda brought a more serious note to Carnival this year, however, with its production of Cabaret. Cabaret focuses on the Kit Kat Club, a seedy cabaret club in Berlin, as the Nazis are rising to power. The play centers on the relationship between English cabaret performer Sally Bowles (Heinz College master’s student Shannon Deep) and American writer Clifford Bradshaw (junior music major Sean Pack).
The set was fairly sparse, with a balcony and staircases leading down on either side of the balcony and only a select number of furniture pieces that the crew added and removed from the stage as necessary. Around the edge of the stage were round tables with red tablecloths that audience members could sit at. During the scenes set at the Kit Kat Club, the seductive Kit Kat dancers would approach the edge of the stage and flirt with the audience members sitting at the tables, which helped to reinforce the nightclub atmosphere. The Kit Kat performers were all excellent dancers and stayed in character well; Chandler Patton, a first-year drama student, was particularly entertaining in the role of the young cabaret dancer Helga.
Deep was charming and did an excellent job of showing the complexities of Sally’s character; however, her singing voice, while lovely, lacked the power and depth necessary for the part. She and Pack, who played Clifford Bradshaw, had a great onstage chemistry, and Pack did an excellent job of portraying Cliff’s range of emotions.
Matt Zurcher, a sophomore humanities and arts major, played the Master of Ceremonies of the Kit Kat Club, and functioned as an omniscient storyteller throughout the show. Zurcher was a perfect mix of funny and creepy; he originally had the audience laughing with his eyebrow-waggling and over-the-top attitude, but became progressively more eerie and terrifying as the show progressed and the Nazis gained more power.
Cabaret also featured a romantic subplot involving Cliff’s landlady, Fraulein Schneider (played by junior music major Gillian Hassert), and one of her boarders, a Jewish fruit vendor named Herr Schultz (played by Alex DiClaudio, a master’s student in Heinz College). Their scenes together were tender and funny, particularly when they sang “It Couldn’t Please Me More,” about a pineapple that Herr Schultz gives Fraulein Schneider.
One problem with the show was the actors’ accents. Sally had an English accent, and the rest of the characters aside from Cliff had German accents; however, the actors’ accents were not always consistent, and often sounded more like caricatures of German or English accents, rather than sounding genuine.
Despite the inconsistencies with accents, Will Weiner and Dan Wetzel, a sophomore economics and decision sciences major and a CIT master’s student, respectively, directed the show. They put on a strong production, drawing the audience into the world of the Kit Kat Club while managing to be funny and poignant.

With all the activities going on during Carnival, some events slip through the cracks. The Big Boi concert, brought to us by Carnegie Mellon’s Activities Board, was one event that refused to do so. AB is no stranger to pulling off some stellar concerts. Its past Carnival concert successes include performances by The New Pornographers in 2009 and The Black Keys in 2010.
For this year’s Carnival, AB kept up the momentum of past success by introducing Carnegie Mellon to Big Boi, one half of the hip hop duo known as OutKast. The concert, which was almost relocated indoors due to weather misgivings, was held on the CFA Lawn. As concertgoers assembled around the stage, Hunt Library’s multicolored lights glowed in the background, adding to the excitement and heightening anticipation of the night’s performance.
When AB introduced the opener, Brother Ali, the crowd could barely contain its enthusiasm. Students from Carnegie Mellon, Pitt, and other schools welcomed the famous albino hip hop artist as he took the stage and performed some of his more famous numbers. Brother Ali, straight off his Fresh Air Tour, is no stranger to the spotlight. Armed with a microphone and his DJ, Brother Ali set out to show the audience why his latest album is in Billboard’s Top 100. After pumping up the crowd, he exited the stage to raucous applause, greeting and hugging fans as he left.
After Brother Ali, Big Boi, the long awaited headliner, took the stage. Right away, he opened with an OutKast classic. As the lyrics to “Ms. Jackson” rang out, the crowd went crazy and started singing along. Big Boi, or Antwon André Patton — also known as Daddy Fat Sax and General Patton — kept the audience going with oldies, new hits like “Tangerine,” and politically charged numbers like “Bombs Over Baghdad.”
His onstage antics proved he was a masterful performer, combining talent and personality to win the crowd. Some, like sophomore Madeleine Kelly, were converted into fans when roommates and friends took them to the concert. Kelly, a materials science and engineering major, said her favorite part of the show was when Big Boi played “Shutterbugg.” “He was just as good live as when I was just listening to his music,” Kelly said. “I definitely think he was a hit here, especially since there were so many people not from Carnegie Mellon that attended.”
Kelly wasn’t the only one who thought the performance was powerful. “I’m in love with Big Boi and really liked the concert,” Ruari Egan, a sophomore civic engineering major, said. “I loved when he played ‘Fo Yo Sorrows’ off his new album — that’s my favorite song.” The album, Sir Luscious Left Foot… The Son of Chico Dusty, was released in July 2010.
Big Boi continued to present his album during the Carnival concert and played a good number of songs from his new album, including “Shutterbugg” — one of the most popular songs on the album — “You Ain’t No DJ,” and “Shine Blockas” to name a few. He even let a group of girls from the audience go up and dance with him onstage for two or three songs, no doubt garnering some dedicated fans in the process. This crowd-pleasing tactic, along with the pulsating lights set up on the stage and the music videos playing on the left and right of the stage, all combined to form a well-planned and impressive concert spectacular.
Every year it seems like the Carnival concert is getting bigger, badder, and better. Congratulations to the coordinators of the AB Concerts and the Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh community for making this year’s Carnival concert something special. Next year will no doubt exceed expectations as well.

Booth. Buggy. Carnegie Mellon has many unique Carnival events, and one of the less prominent — but no less unique — events is the annual Mobot races held by the School of Computer Science (SCS). Robotics Institute senior research technician Greg Armstrong emceed the event in true Scottish fashion, wearing a kilt with the Armstrong clan tartan and carrying a sword for effect.
The 17th Annual Mobot Races took place last Friday afternoon on the course outside Doherty and Wean halls. The competition challenges teams to build and race their vehicles (“MObile roBOTs”) along a solid white line through a series of gates arranged in a slalom-like pattern (see last week’s SciTech for more details). In addition to SCS, the Mobot events are sponsored by Lockheed Martin, TwoSigma, Google, and Misumi USA. The winner of this year’s competition and the $1,000 grand prize was Team Stingray, a one-man team consisting of junior Kwabena Agyeman, an ECE major. The second-place prize of $500 went to Team Commandaria, which consisted of senior math and computer science double major Aaron Jaech and senior ECE majors Diana Hu and Kyle Neblett. Third place ($250) went to Team Three Dollars to Win, comprised of sophomore ECE major James Wahawisan.
Despite winning first place out of the six undergraduate teams competing, Stingray did not complete the Mobot course. The course has a total of 14 gates, and Stingray maneuvered through eight, making it the furthest in the shortest amount of time, before running off the line into the grass. Each mobot is programmed by its designers, and Agyeman did not include an algorithm to navigate the challenging second half of the course, in which the robots must choose to take the left or right fork at several “decision points.”
These decision points are only a few of the many challenges on the Mobot course. While humans have the option of taking stairs on the sidewalk down the Mall, the mobots must drive down the two steep hills to finish the course. Robots that go down a hill too quickly will lose track of the path or crash, making designers take this into account when building and programming their mobots. For instance, Agyeman said that his “robot’s pretty much driving backwards” when going downhill.
In Friday’s race, the bright sunlight created difficulty for the mobots’ vision sensors. During the awards ceremony after the races, Catherine Copetas, the SCS assistant dean for industry relations, SCS director of special events, and a member of the Mobot organizing committee, commented that “sensors just don’t like really, really bright light.”
The resurfaced patches of cement on the sidewalk also challenged the mobots. Although most of the sidewalk is a dark gray color, certain patches have been replaced with a lighter color. Because these patches are close to the white color of the track, many mobots drove off the course after reaching them. A patch just after the second gate proved particularly difficult.
In addition to the six undergraduate teams competing for the awards, three exhibition teams also ran the course. Eli Richter’s mobot, named Johnny 0.5, was the only one to finish the entire course Friday, completing all 14 gates in a time of 1:00.30. Richter said that his mobot has sensors with resolution as high as 1/10-inch and that his main limitation on time was that he “just wasn’t able to steer as tight” given the physical constraints of his robot’s frame.
While the focus of Friday’s event was on the competition, the Robotics Club members used the Mobot races to raise awareness of their group. Several competitors were in the club, and the group was selling T-shirts nearby. Red Robot, the Robotics Club’s mascot, was wandering through the crowd to the delight of the many children at the event.
The Mobot Committee has plans to expand the competition beyond the existing path-following challenge. Copetas said that they plan to add the challenge of following the course backward after it is completed and that she would like to incorporate the Gates Center’s Helix into a Mobot competition in the future. She stressed that mobots’ small size or the seemingly simplicity of their task is deceptive. “We should not underrepresent how much work goes into mobots,” she said.

Spring Carnival this year saw the debut of the Midway Marketplace, which acted as an exhibition for student organizations that don’t otherwise get to participate in Carnival. The Marketplace, located on the edge of Midway, took the place of last year’s side tent, which had been previously used for smaller concerts and performances. Throughout the duration of Spring Carnival, about 40 participants joined in to display an exhibit at The Marketplace.
Midway Marketplace was organized by Vivian Chang, a sophomore science and humanities scholar, and Christopher Vu, a master’s student studying creative enterprise at Heinz College. “We wanted to create a unique system that would reach out to members of the Carnegie Mellon community that traditionally did not participate in Spring Carnival and try to revitalize their school spirit,” Vu said. “Because of this mission, we created a unique format to encompass as many people to be involved in the competition process.”
The two organizers also decided to add a competitive element to the marketplace. “The point of Marketplace was to give an outlet for more of our organizations to showcase their activities, talents, and points to the community,” Chang said. “We wanted organizations that don’t have the manpower to compete in Booth to have an opportunity to engage in Midway and Spring Carnival overall.” The Marketplace entries were judged in one of four categories: Presentations and Displays, Cultural Arts, Merchandise, and Discussion Forum. Participants were judged both by regular spectators who cast paper votes and by hidden judges who masqueraded as regular spectators within the crowd. Due to weather, though, the Midway Marketplace was closed for the entirety of Saturday, and therefore the final round of judging never took place.
Despite this setback, the judges presented the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) with the award for Best in Show, with the Robotics Club and Game Creation Society serving as the first and second runners-up, respectively. Game Creation Society also received first place in the Presentation category, while Robotics Club and SHPE both received the Popularity Award. SHPE also won in the Cultural Arts category. The Tartan and CMU Life Matters Club tied to win in the Discussion category. The Awareness of Roots in Chinese Culture club, which was selling tickets to its annual show “One Night in Beijing,” won in the Merchandise category. Not all of the awards were positive, however; cmuTV received the Wooden Spoon award for worst presentation.
Though the campus participation in Midway Market was encouraging, Vu and Chang are unsure as to whether it will be continued next year. Vu explained, “We received a lot of mixed feedback from the participants ... and if this were to continue, it would be great to open up Marketplace for groups outside CMU, such as UPitt or from all of Pittsburgh proper, to participate and create a healthy community outside of just school.”

Noah Benjamin Lennox first began performing and recording music with friends as a teenager. Lennox recorded under the alias “Panda Bear,” mimicking the mammal that adorned the artwork for most of his recordings. As a musician, Lennox is most widely known for recording with close friends Deakin (Josh Dibb), Avey Tare (Dave Portner), and Geologist (Brian Witz) in the highly popular and experimental band Animal Collective. While Animal Collective has received a large amount of media attention since the 2007 release of its acclaimed record Strawberry Jam and the release of Merriweather Post Pavilion, which was named Fact Magazine’s “Best Album of 2009,” not enough has been said for Lennox’s work as an independent artist.
Born in Baltimore, Md., Lennox released his debut album Panda Bear on Soccer Star Records in 1998. Lennox took a break from recording his solo work to focus on touring and recording with Animal Collective, but released his second album, Young Prayer, in 2004. Lennox’s third album and 2007 release Person Pitch was his most acclaimed — it was named Pitchfork Media’s top album of 2007. Lennox’s fourth album, Tomboy, has only added to the presence of his solo project Panda Bear.
Despite the shorter song times, Tomboy is just as blissfully psychedelic as Panda Bear’s previous albums. With their dream-pop choirs and consistent synth bass beats, Lennox’s new tracks allow his angelic voice to shine. What is perhaps the most impressive about this album, however, is Lennox’s poetic lyrics, which exceed the lyrical quality of his previous albums.
The track “Last Night at the Jetty” mimics many of the waving rhythms that Animal Collective enthusiasts will find both familiar and rhythmically pleasing. That being said, Lennox’s album is not as unorganized as the work he has done with Animal Collective. This is especially evident in songs like “Drone” and “Slow Motion,” where the vocal tracks are smooth and spiritual and the instrumental tracks are stylistically church-like and musically accessible.
The album’s title track, “Tomboy,” is edgy and features an incredible use of production effects. The harmonies in “You Can Count on Me” mimic those of Fleet Foxes. The vocals are complicated and detailed, with several parts, echoes, and additional lines that make this song an incredibly hypnotizing opening track. “Surfer’s Hymn” is the most beach-pop of all the songs, as appropriately represented by its title. The song develops in waves, again a characteristic that most likely led the to track’s naming.
The album’s longest track, “Afterburner,” is an evolutionary track — growing and growing in detail with each second. The album ends with “Benfica,” a song that does not truly develop until its last minute, when it slows and breaks down into a beautiful and deliberate arrangement of chimes and bells.
If you find yourself curious for some new music or craving the unfamiliarity of a new and experimental genre, then be sure to pick up this album. Tomboy could arguably be one of the best experimental albums of the year.

This year’s Carnival marked the second annual Game Creation Society Arcade, which took place in the Gates Hillman Complex Thursday through Saturday. The GCS Arcade is a public showcase for the projects that students in the club have taken up throughout the semester. Junior English major Connor Fallon, president of GCS, said that GCS has become one of the larger organizations on campus with about 50 members, and the result could be seen with the wide variety of games that were being shown.
This year, GCS was able to borrow laptops from the clusters to help display more games, for a total of around 15. A few of these games were GCS favorites that date back a few years, but many of them were newer projects students have been working on in the past year, including Satisfaction, Hydramen, Robot Imminent, and 30 Second Life. This year’s event also allowed some games to be tested, meaning that the designers could receive feedback on games that were still in progress to help them in the development process.
One of the games that was being showcased was Robokiller. At first glance, Robokiller is a typical first-person shooter, but that assumption is immediately turned on its head when trying to fire at enemies. Instead of a typical aim and fire control scheme, Robokiller has the player use a close-range welding gun to erase specific features of the enemy robots and to disarm them by removing their vision or armaments. The game is fairly difficult at first, as the welding gun only works at close range, whereas the robots are equipped with long-range weaponry.
Satisfaction, a solo project by electrical and computer engineering senior Kyle Neblett, was part of a week-long contest GCS held to make a game about duels. In the game, players go through a series of duels with various historical figures, whom the player must challenge by slapping them across the face, and then fighting them in a gentleman’s duel that resembles a sword-filled version of punch-out. Characters in the game include Alexander Hamilton and Abraham Lincoln. The dodging and aiming system in the game is a bit difficult to get used to, but there are special instances to attack opponents to inflict the maximum amount of damage.
Motora is a 2-D platformer with an additional dynamic: a grappling hook that can be used to scale walls, swing from the ceiling, and attack enemies. The game is well-polished, and the grappling mechanic is well-designed — swinging from platform to platform above pits of spikes looks and feels natural. The mechanic itself is a bit reminiscent of the Worms series, where the swinging and climbing worked in a similar way, but the usage in a side-scrolling platformer as the primary device — and the strong execution of it — was impressive.
Backfire is an interesting twist on the space shooter genre. After selecting a ship, the game eases the player in with levels that ask the player to bounce lasers off of slanted walls to hit boxes. One of the primary obstacles in the game is the danger of backfire — the player’s shots have the potential to bounce back and destroy the player instead. A few levels in, the game introduces enemy ships, which fire lasers that bounce similar to the player’s, except the ships are immune to backfire from their own lasers, making it easy for them to pile up a large wall of lasers for the player to dodge.
Lucid is a dark platformer where the player must use a flashlight and gun to fight his or her opponents. What quickly becomes apparent is that the game doesn’t let players use both at once, so they must use a flashlight to seek out the enemy, and then their gun to fire. This problem is somewhat remedied by the light from the gun muzzle, so once a player locates the enemy, the flashlight isn’t an absolute necessity.
Hydramen is an impressive game, made in under 45 hours, that features adorable little hydramen. The hydramen are quick to multiply, but easy to kill. In some situations, it benefits the player to “farm” for hydramen, collecting a small army before tackling an obstacle. In other situations, fewer is better: The camera falls on the middle of the stack, so jumping from platform to platform can be fairly difficult.
30 Second Life was part of a competition to make a game that plays in 30 seconds. The game takes players through someone’s life as players frantically slam on random keys to improve their character’s position in life by “working.” The game features outcomes ranging from zombie, to vigilante (identifiable as Batman), to the Messiah, based on when and where the player decides to work or not work.
Fallon said that one of the most satisfying things is to see young children play a game: “When a kid sits down and just randomly yells in the middle of the game, ‘This game is awesome!’ that’s so gratifying.” He felt that this year was an “unquestionable success” with the amount of people who attended — most of the games were being played at any given time. At the event, there were people of all ages enjoying the games, including alumni and professors with their children. It was a chance for the people at GCS to share their passion with the outside world, and to let people see the unique ideas that students are coming up with.

V for Vendetta
7:30 10 12:30
Who is V? Is he a terrorist working to destroy society and order, or is he a freedom fighter working to start the revolution that is the only hope for the people of England? V for Vendetta, directed by James McTeigue, is set in London in a future dystopian community. Evey, played by Natalie Portman, is a young employee at the government-managed British Television Network who, through a random encounter with the masked vigilante V, becomes a wanted criminal. Evey is forced to choose between living a normal life in totalitarian London, or joining forces with her Guy Fawkes-masked friend V to change the world.
Green Hornet

The Green Hornet is a superhero action-comedy film that was released in January 2011. The film is based off of the character, The Green Hornet, who originated in the 1930s. The Green Hornet starred in comic books, movie serials, television shows, and radio programs. The movie stars Seth Rogen, who also co-wrote the screenplay, as Britt Reid, the 28-year-old publisher of a Los Angeles newspaper. When Britt's father is found dead from an allergic reaction to a bee sting, Britt and his friend Kato decide to pose as criminals in order to infiltrate the crime world and bring peace to the world. The film earned a 45 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
Red

The action comedy, loosely inspired by the three-issue comic book series of the same name, stars Bruce Willis as Frank Moses, a former CIA agent living in retirement. Frank's peace at home is interrupted when he is attacked by a squad of assassins in the night. Frank soon finds that he is being hunted, along with several others who participated in a secret mission in Guatemala in 1981 and who are being killed off one by one in order to silence them. The film was extremely successful, having grossed $186 million worldwide. Summit Entertainment confirmed that writers are working on a sequel to the film, which they expect will surpass the original film financially.
TBA
7:30 10 12:30
It's that much anticipated time of the year, ladies and gentlemen: It's the time of the year where students and community members alike gather together in the University Center to celebrate freedom of speech and expression. TBA is a semesterly event in which the Activities Board substitutes a dollar movie showing to screen an adult film. Although the showing has received much criticism over the past couple of years, the event has become a celebrated and anticipated occasion for the student community. If you find yourself free of homework and in need of some comedic relief, why not gather some friends together and head down to TBA? After all, nothing tickles the funny bone quite like watching naked people "do it."

While this past Saturday saw Tech Street empty and desolate — free of the presence of any buggies — The Oakland Review, Carnegie Mellon’s undergraduate literary journal, gathered a small but intimate crowd in the University Center for a special reading of poetry and fiction.
The group gathered in the McKenna Room of the University Center for what was deemed by most a thoughtful and entertaining reading. “I thought that the event was a success — the audience seemed to enjoy themselves, and there was ample time for both students, alumni, and Terrance Hayes to read,” Shannon Azzato Stephens, co-editor-in-chief of the journal, said in an e-mail. “For my part, I was honored to read with Terrance.”
Sara Keats, assistant to the editors-in-chief, spoke of the authors and the pieces that were read. Of the first three readers, Keats said, “Elyssa Goodman graduated last year, and the poem she read was accepted for our fall 2010 alumni journal. The second and third readers, Brian [Sherwin] and [Gabriel Routh], read their work that was accepted into our upcoming issue.” The final two readers were Stephens herself and Terrance Hayes, The Oakland Review’s adviser and winner of the National Book Award for his book of poetry, Lighthead. Keats said, “I believe both poems Shannon read were from her senior thesis. Terrance Hayes read after Shannon and closed out the program.”
Stephens said that, while there was no particular set theme for the reading, the goal was to focus on celebrating The Oakland Review as an organization. Stephens, who organized the event with the help of Mara Barker, the director of regional programs in the Office of Alumni Relations, said that “the roster of readers I set up included Oakland Review staff, students published in this year’s alumni and undergraduate editions, and Terrance Hayes, our adviser.” Keats was pleased that the alumni that attended took such an interest in the event.
In a sense, this event, combined with the alumni edition of The Oakland Review that was published in the fall of 2010, worked in tandem to foster a stronger network among _Oakland Review _alumni and graduates of the English department.
With regard to The Oakland Review’s alumni network, Keats said in an e-mail, “I’m really hoping we got the word [out] about submissions for the alumni journal. I could be wrong about this, but I don’t think that there’s an established alumni network for English the way there are for other departments, and there certainly isn’t an alumni group for The Oakland Review, so to see people take that kind of unprecedented interest in what we do was really nice.”
As of this spring, there have been two alumni issues published so far. The first was published in the fall of 2009, while the second was published in fall 2010. Although the alumni issues began as an experiment, after the highly positive reception of the first alumni issue, the idea was deemed a success. Oakland Review editors are planning on continuing this series in the future. “The alumni issue is great, just because it gives us a reason to exist in the fall semester and keeps us connected to graduates,” Keats said. “I think our contact list for the alumni journal comes mostly from lists of people who submit while they were here who have recently graduated and from names we get from professors in the department. Hopefully this event will mean we’ll get a few new writers next semester.”
For those interested in exploring the literary and artistic offerings published by The Oakland Review, the wait won’t be long. Stephens said that the journal’s 36th annual undergraduate edition comes out April 29, the same day as the Adamson Awards. Copies will be free and distributed around campus.

100 YEARS AGO -- April 19, 1911
The Tartan, waiting for office space in the “projected new administration building” (now Baker Hall), announces it will be headquartered in the Applied Science School’s committee room. The editors thank a Mr. Orbin for furnishing the room with a desk for the paper’s editorial board. Such luxury!
50 YEARS AGO -- April 19, 1961
The Tartan announces that Alpha Phi Omega will hold two contests on the Cut in the next week: the election for Spring Carnival Queen, and the annual “Ugliest Man on Campus” competition. The Tartan expected there would be “a striking contrast between the two groups.” We plead no contest with that statement.
25 YEARS AGO -- April 22, 1986
Three Alpha Tau Omega brothers suffered burns during Sweepstakes when a chemical they were using to treat their buggy’s wheels leaked onto a radio and caught fire. The brothers were actually injured while carrying the buggy out of the team’s truck and freeing the driver, who was trapped inside. As if this sport needed any additional danger.
10 YEARS AGO -- April 16, 2001
The Entropy convenience store is in the news this week for selling cigarettes, an option at Carnegie Mellon that is almost unheard of at peer institutions. Administrators say they are willing to have a dialogue on the issue — little knowing, presumably, that most of the campus would be a no-smoking zone a decade later.
FIVE YEARS AGO -- April 24, 2006
Following the controversy surrounding “Walking to the Sky,” the university installs a much smaller piece of public art, a statue of Mao Yisheng. The eight-foot work in bronze represents Carnegie Tech’s first Ph.D. graduate. Obviously, our next piece of art should be a 100-foot colossus of Andrew Carnegie “Walking to Skibo.”
ONE YEAR AGO -- April 19, 2010
A SciTech article discusses a study in which children with Williams Syndrome, a rare neurodevelopmental disorder, showed no racial prejudices when assigning positive or negative features to pictures of people. That means they’re already doing better in life than this year’s Carnival comedian.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I’ve been working on this class project for a little while, but my partner hasn’t been pulling his weight. Now the due date’s coming up and I need his part of it, but he’s been dodging my calls, ignoring my e-mails, and disregarding my texts. How can I get in contact with him? What can I do about his half of the project?
Thanks, Partner In Need
Dear PIN,
That’s the problem with partner projects — it always seems like you’re the one who does everything. The easiest answer is just to talk to your partner in class. If it’s due before then (or he’s skipping class), you have a harder problem. The next step is to use a disguise, like a fake mustache, to fool him into talking to you. Try borrowing a friend’s phone and using that to call him. He’ll answer if he doesn’t know it’s you. If he’s savvier still, see if you have any mutual friends and use them to track him down.
If all else fails, then resort to an old standby: Facebook stalking. Try to find his address by seeing if he’s created any events at his house. If he’s a first-year, he’s probably in a Facebook group for his dorm or floor. Once you know where he lives, you can show up and stage a sit-in. Don’t leave until he does his work.
Try public shaming, 
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
Help! I’m stranded at Ikea. How do I get home? Is the Pittsburgh public transportation system screwing with me?
Sincerely, Trapped With Swedes
Dear TWS,
Whatever you do, don’t get the Swedish meatballs. Next thing you know, you’ll be wearing sweaters, spending half your life in darkness, and be a stinking socialist. The key is to remain calm and American. Sing the national anthem a few times. When you’re done, call up your friends (or people you can blackmail) with cars. Beg, plead, and blackmail them into driving out to pick you up. If that fails, call a cab. Supposedly you can put in a request to get the 28X to stop and pick you up, but you’d have better luck finding a camel to ride home.
Pittsburgh recently cut bus funding, which, among other things, changed the 28X to people off at the mall and Ikea, but not pick them up unless “requested.” (I think that means bribes.) Pittsburgh’s broke, and the city’s taking it out on you. Specifically you. It’s like a broke friend who borrows your car to go to a job interview, and then goes joyriding and drives off a cliff. Think Thelma and Louise, but more yelling “jagoff” out the window.
Pittsburgh buses suck, **

When I heard the word “jazz” growing up, the image that usually came to mind was of sophisticated old-money types, sipping cognac and stroking their neatly-trimmed goatees while sitting in one of their three libraries. Jazz was a passionless vehicle for the intellectual elite to assert their superiority over the “common people.” This now frustrates me not just because jazz is more than elevator or lounge music, but because it has such a rich emotional and cultural heritage.
Look back to the jazz of the 1920s and 1930s American South. Musicians who are now ingrained in the American music canon like Louis Armstrong, Roy Eldridge, Count Basie, and King Oliver were living testaments to the preservation of the human spirit in times of strife. To live in a time and place where something as menial as the color of your skin could get you beaten or killed was horrifying. These men could have given in to despair, but instead they chose to celebrate life through their music. Listen to a recording of Louis Armstrong performing “Hello Dolly” or Roy Eldridge performing “Fireworks”; it is difficult not to smile. The ability to look beyond the troubles of life and circumstance — that is the heart and soul of jazz.
Unfortunately, hot jazz has mostly disappeared from American culture. Finding musicians who still perform in the style of jazz’s progenitors is a difficult and arduous task; however, the results are well worth it. Bands like The Cangelosi Cards and Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks may not be well known, but they have kept the hot jazz tradition alive, reminding society why jazz became so popular in the first half of the 20th century and how it is the brick and mortar of today’s popular music. They perform cohesive, tasteful, and upbeat jazz with a nearly unrivaled passion. Jazz does not have to go hand in hand with sobriety and maturity. In fact, jazz seems to work best when performed with youthful abandon and an unabashed love of life.

Carnegie Mellon will raise tuition by 4 percent for incoming students and 3 percent for returning students for the Fall 2011 semester. Housing and dining rates will also be increased by 3.97 percent and 2.47 percent, respectively. The total cost of attendance is expected to rise by 4.24 percent for new students and 3.45 percent for current students. 
According to Kim Abel, the director of Housing and Dining Services, room and board costs depend on a number of factors, including necessary repairs, general program costs, and the state of the market. “We make every effort to control costs,” Abel said via e-mail. “We also review economic issues. For instance, gas cost can impact services delivered to the department such as freight charges.”
Abel said that, although rates have increased, the university has been able to limit some of the increases. “Dining rates are somewhat dependent on the number of individuals who participate in the meal plan program,” Abel said. “Because of the increase in meal plan participation by upper class students, we were able to minimize the overall rate increase of the meal plans.”
Tuition increases, however, are affected by other factors. Michael Murphy, the vice president for campus affairs, said that the amount that tuition is raised in a given year is determined largely by inflation. 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the overall rate of inflation in the United States was 2.1 percent in 2010. Tuition increases are proposed by members of the administration and approved by the board of trustees. Murphy is one of the decision-makers behind tuition increases, along with Carnegie Mellon’s chief financial officer, Deborah Moon, and provost, Mark Kamlet.
Other factors, in addition to inflation, are considered as well. “Probably the two biggest issues [in determining tuition] were financial aid and the impact that the current economy was having on students and families, and also on the university in terms of the endowment,” Murphy said.
According to the press release announcing the hike, approximately 30 percent of tuition is returned to students in the form of financial aid — a historic high, according to Murphy. Tuition is by far the largest source of financial aid funds; according to the annual factbook released by Carnegie Mellon’s Office of Institutional Research and Analysis, it accounted for more than 50 percent of the financial aid distributed in 2010.
The other 70 percent of tuition revenue generally pays for operational costs in instruction, student services, and academic support — for example, professors’ salaries.
In addition to tuition, Carnegie Mellon has two other major sources of income: research grants, of which a portion is used to support utilities that make research possible, but the majority of which pays for the research itself; and the endowment.
Carnegie Mellon’s endowment is built out of large private donations. The university then invests the donations, and withdraws 5 percent of the market value annually, on a three-year running average. That is, Carnegie Mellon withdraws enough each year so that, given any three consecutive years, the average draw for those years is 5 percent. Thus, when the economy hits a low point, there is less money for the university to draw. Moreover, even if the economy recovers, the endowment draw will still be affected for several years, due to the three-year average.
Between 2008 and 2009, according to the factbook, the market value of Carnegie Mellon’s endowment dropped by $300 million, from just over $1 billion to about $750 million. Though it regained about $60 million in 2010, the annual endowment draw is still lower than normal, and will continue to be low for several years. This puts pressure on tuition funds.
“We’re in two principal forms of business, so we don’t have enough money for either,” Murphy said. “Tuition doesn’t quite cover education; research support doesn’t quite cover research. That’s why private gifts and the endowment are so important.”
Despite low endowment draw, the tuition increase for the 2009–10 school year was 2.9 percent for incoming students, the lowest since 1975. For the current school year, the increase was a similarly low 3 percent for new students. 
In contrast, the average tuition increase for the past decade was 5.4 percent. The 2009–10 school year saw across-the-board pay freezes for faculty and staff, and last year, a modified pay freeze took effect.
“I think [the low tuition increases were] purely recognition that these are hard economic times,” said Murphy.
Recently, however, the administration decided that it was time to take a different strategy for the upcoming 2011–12 school year. Murphy said that the larger tuition increase was made in order to maintain the quality of Carnegie Mellon’s education and in order to bolster financial aid. Carnegie Mellon has traditionally held an annual fall meeting with a selection of local students and families in order to discuss tuition, and Murphy said that the decision to raise tuition was met with general agreement.
“I think it was a good decision,” Murphy said. “I think it was a positive decision for students.” He stressed, however, that the current environment is still one of financial constraint.
“I can’t find too much fault with the logic of raising the tuition,” said sophomore creative writing major Jack Homer, who was not involved in this year’s tuition meeting. “But I do wish that it didn’t have to happen, because it’s obviously going to be putting a strain on everybody involved.”
Homer’s father, John Homer, was decidedly less supportive of the decision to raise tuition. “[Carnegie Mellon’s] tuition is already among the highest in the country,” he said, “and tuition hikes make less and less sense every year, particularly because the economy is crumbling, and the $200,000 invested is no longer a guarantee of having a well-paying job after college.”
Carnegie Mellon is not alone. For the 2011–12 school year, Stanford University reported a projected tuition, room, and board increase of 3.5 percent; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported a tuition and fees increase of 3.9 percent; the University of Pennsylvania reported a tuition increase of 3.9 percent; and Georgetown University reported a tuition increase of 2.9 percent.
In contrast, according to The Wall Street Journal, the University of the South cut tuition by 10 percent for the coming school year. It is the only major university to have done so in recent years.
Carnegie Mellon does not consider the actions of other universities when making decisions about tuition increases, Murphy said. He said that the strategy for tuition adjustments is to place the majority of the burden on incoming students.
“We try to keep increases for continuing students as manageable as possible and put our risk in the marketplace,” Murphy said. “[New] students can make their decision with their eyes open.”
According to Murphy, the risk is paying off; Carnegie Mellon is still a popular candidate among prospective college students. The university’s undergraduate applicant pool grew by 9.5 percent between 2009 and 2010.
In other words, as long as people still want to come to Carnegie Mellon, students can expect tuition to keep rising.

Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of the website Reddit, the travel search engine Hipmunk, and the online geek-boutique Breadpig, gave a lecture to undergraduate and graduate students in McConomy Auditorium last Monday. The event was sponsored by the Activities Board.
While Ohanian discussed some of the inner workings of Reddit’s infrastructure, the core of Ohanian’s talk was one of inspiration. The talk had students taking notes and laughing as Ohanian discussed his experience in the world of startups. As would be expected from a self-proclaimed geek, Ohanian complemented his talking points with humorous tongue-in-cheek slides of Photoshopped images of kittens, puppies, and celebrities.
The discussion started with Ohanian recounting his college years at the University of Virginia, during which he majored in history, built relationships playing video games, and aspired toward entrepreneurship. It was at this time, during his first month in the dormitories, that Ohanian met Steve Huffman. Huffman would later become not only a close friend of his, but also his partner in founding Reddit. During the talk, Ohanian explained how this bond with Huffman was critical to Reddit’s success as an online startup.
As a tech-oriented undergraduate, Ohanian admired Paul Graham, the programmer and venture capitalist behind the seed capital firm Y-Combinator. Both Ohanian and Huffman saw him as a role model. “During one spring break we heard that Paul Graham was giving a talk at Harvard on how to start a startup. Given what Graham fanboys we were, we packed our bags for Massachusetts,” Ohanian said. The talk motivated Ohanian and Huffman to partner up and try their hand at startups.
Despite Ohanian’s recent successes with Reddit, Breadpig, and Hipmunk, his experiences in the world of startups were not always so fruitful. His first attempt at a startup was a failed mobile take-out app for cell phones. Ohanian said that although he and Huffman were confident that there was an audience for their potential startup’s service, attempts at implementing their plan were deemed unfeasible by investors given the amount of time and work that cell-phone carriers and restaurants would have to do in order to effectively implement their app. 
“When we received the message from Graham, we were heartbroken. That night we hit the bar. Hard,” said Ohanian.
After Ohanian recovered from the heartbreak that ensued from the rejection of his proposal, he and Huffman started anew. In 2005, after both of them graduated, the two founded Reddit.
It was at this point in the talk that Ohanian began to explain how all of his experiences were relevant to the ambitious students in the audience. He discussed the elements of successful businesses and urged students to get started with their own. According to a recent article about the company in Pop City Media, “Reddit is among the top 100 websites in the world, with 15 million visitors a month and 1 billion page views.”
Ohanian’s guiding principle was to always be concerned with “making something people want.” He stated that, as obvious as that principle might seem, it was often overlooked in the business world. Speaking in regard to the new business opportunities that the Internet created, Ohanian said, “Although anyone can put any kind of business online, only the quality sites that put the user first are the ones that survive and grow.” To illustrate this, he gave an overview of the successes of Hipmunk.
Ohanian explained that the guiding principle behind Hipmunk was “to maximize joy.” This might sound a bit strange coming from the founder of a travel search engine, but when he elaborated on the point, it became clearer to the audience. The standard model for the revenue streams of traditional search engines like Expedia is based on bombarding the user with ads at any and all possible times. Additionally, Hipmunk takes into account many factors that are often left out of the analyses of other search engines, like proximity to bars, safety, and general convenience. Ohanian claims that this kind of considerate and ultimately human design will create a loyal user base, who end up becoming repeat customers.
Zachary Wise, a junior computer science major, attended Ohanian’s lecture. “He was pretty charismatic, and he really sold the idea that founding startups is the way to go, but he never sugar-coated how incredibly difficult it is to do. No matter how much success or misery any of our startups has, he wants us to make sure what he do helps to, [in Ohanian’s words], ‘make the world suck less,’ ” said Wise, summarizing the event.
At the end of his lecture, after a question and answer session, Ohanian wanted to share his optimism for what he called “a world ruled by nerds,” and that he sincerely hoped students had pet projects that they were truly passionate about.

The Resnik/West Wing community, the Interdisciplinary House, and Randall Feenstra have created a new, green initiative on campus for students. A “Giving Wall” has appeared in the basement of the University Center, across from the FedEx office. At first glance, it’s just a set of shelves where students can leave their discarded belongings. At second glance, however, it provides students with a convenient way to increase the campus’s environmental sustainability. As the sign next to the wall states, the collaborators’ “goal is for people to voluntarily donate items and take items, creating a free and simple exchange of goods.”
Students can now recycle in a different way than they previously have; rather than recycle plastic bottles or glass, they can recycle old, unused items. By leaving items they no longer want or need on the shelves of the Giving Wall and taking what others have donated, students are aiding in the creation of a sustainable and simple method of recycling. This initiative not only aims to increase campus recycling, it also hopes to benefit the community by re-gifting items to those who need them. 
One of Carnegie Mellon’s biggest initiatives in the last few years has been to transform itself into an environmentally friendly campus. The appearance of a student-run initiative like the Giving Wall is evidence of that fact.
Before the Giving Wall, there were — and still are — many resources available for students to become involved in on-campus green initiatives. Initiatives like StepGreen challenge students to reduce their environmental impact and learn how to “green their routine.” Student-run groups like Sustainable Earth, Eco-Reps, and Net Impact all focus on different areas of environmental sustainability.
Sustainable Earth, one of the groups involved in the Giving Wall, hosts and attends many different events to promote awareness of environmental problems on campus. This weekend, the group is participating in “Environment Today: Biodiversity and Environmental Justice,” a weekend-long course that allows Carnegie Mellon students to gather and discuss the environmental issues that are affecting the planet. 
Other student-run initiatives that made a splash this year included the Tap Water Project, where students collaborated with CulinArt to install greener water dispensers, and with Carnegie Mellon Orientation staff to ensure that new students were given stainless steel, and thus reusable, water bottles.
However, for those students who do not have the time to commit to one of these groups, they can still give back to the community through the Giving Wall. 
“I’m too busy to join an organization, but it’s so easy to drop some of my old stuff off at the UC,” sophomore social and decision sciences major Joanne Yun said. “I think once people know about it, it could be a great way to exchange useful things and lessen our carbon footprint. It’s a win-win situation.”
Alumni who came back for Carnival also commented on the Giving Wall. “It seems like a great idea,” said Brad Hall, a 2009 mechanical engineering graduate. “Even if people take a lot of stuff from it, it plants the idea that we don’t have to throw stuff away, that every used thing still has a utility.”
Cared for by Sustainable Earth and supported by the Student Dormitory Council, the Giving Wall has the potential to make a significant impact on the Carnegie Mellon campus. To become more involved in green initiatives on campus, visit Carnegie Mellon’s green practices website and learn about all the student and campus-run initiatives.

New study seeks to redefine what constitutes torture
The definition of torture is often a difficult concept to grasp, but it usually focuses on the level of pain inflicted.
However, according to recent research, this definition of torture can be subjective and biased. Researchers Loran Nordgren, of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University; George Loewenstein, of Carnegie Mellon University; and Mary-Hunter Morris McDonnell, of Harvard University Law School, conducted four studies on how subjects respond to degrees of pain. 
In these studies, participants had to make two different types of judgments about interrogation tactics: the degree of pain from the tactic and whether the tactic should be considered torture and prohibited.
Within all four studies, some of the subjects had to make the judgments without experiencing the effects of the interrogation tactic while other subjects had to make the same judgment while experiencing a mild version of the pain.  
The experiment’s results indicated that the participants’ definition of torture was only affected by their immediate state of pain. 
“While people may feel they can judge a tactic because they have experienced the pain it produces at some point in the past, this research suggests that people can only empathize with pain when they are directly experiencing it,” said Loewenstein in a university press release.
School of Music hosts free guitar concert and class
Iranian-American classical guitarist Lily Afshar will perform a free public concert at 8 p.m. in the Kresge Theatre in the College of Fine Arts building this Thursday. Besides the concert, Afshar will host a master class at 7 p.m. this Wednesday in the Kresge Theatre. 
Afshar, born in Tehran, Iran, learned to play the guitar at age 10 and graduated with both a bachelor’s and master’s of music in guitar performance from the Boston Conservatory and the New England Conservatory of Music. 
Later, she attended Florida State University and became the first woman in the world to earn a doctorate of music in guitar performance. Today, she is the head of the University of Memphis guitar program and teaches guitar master classes, in addition to her touring. 
As a musician, she has the ability to develop unusual guitar sounds through the use of quarter tones and fretlets.
Afshar’s honors include the 2000 Orville H. Gibson Award for Best Female Classical Guitarist, the Grand Prize in the Aspen Music Festival Guitar Competition, the Top Prize in the Guitar Foundation of America Competition, and the Premier Guitarist Award from the Memphis Chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, among others.

Center for the Arts in Society:_ Pirates of the Caribbean_
Thursday, April 21 at 4:30 p.m.
Adamson Wing (Baker Hall 136)
Carnegie Mellon professor of history Roger Rouse will present a lecture on the Pirates of the Caribbean films, using it as a springboard to think more creatively about the cultural politics of contemporary capitalism. 
On May 20, Disney will release On Stranger Tides, the fourth film of the series. According to Rouse, the films are not just escapist entertainment. They hijack complex histories of rebel piracy to incite conformity to corporate visions of life, labor, and the world at large. This talk offers resources for engaging the new film and pushing past the limiting visions Rouse sees the series as promoting.

During Carnival, Carnegie Mellon students, staff, alumni, and members of the Pittsburgh community are lucky enough to enjoy the privilege of Carnival entertainment. Every year, the Carnegie Mellon Activities Board plans and executes some of the most anticipated concerts, lectures, and events of the season during Carnival weekend. Sadly, this year’s Carnival comedy show did not live up to past standards of success.
While these events are usually successful and well received, it is still important that these shows and the performers that we as a university employ reflect well on our campus community. 
It is for this reason that we at The Tartan were disappointed by the material used by this year’s comedy show performer, Eddie Griffin, as well as AB’s choice of performer. During his performance, Griffin ventured into material that was highly inappropriate; the majority of the comedian’s jokes were either racially, sexually, or religiously offensive. After his scheduled hour-long set, the performer continued drinking on stage and making jokes for another hour and a half, a time filled with increasingly distasteful jokes that relied on homophobic political garble and ethnic slurs. Griffin cursed in almost every joke he told, using derogatory terms for every race and sexual orientation throughout the entirety of his set.
Performers like last year’s Michael and Michael kept the crowd entertained without resorting to offensive religious, racial, and political slurs. The pair catered their act to the audience by incorporating jokes specific to Carnival and to Carnegie Mellon. We do not think that any performer that comes to Carnegie Mellon needs to drastically change his or her act to accommodate our campus community, but being aware of what kind of crowd he or she is addressing should be the responsibility of the performer. 
Griffin’s material might have been appropriate for Comedy Central, but not at a university where diversity and acceptance of ethnic, political, and sexual differences is held up as a standard and defining feature. In addition, this was an important year for Carnegie Mellon’s alumni network; the university chose to combine its previous Homecoming alumni events with Carnival weekend. As members of this community, we do not feel as though Griffin aptly represented our community or our collective interests. 
We wish that the choice of comedian better represented our entire community — which includes students as well as alumni and faculty — so that the performance could have appealed to a broader audience. Carnegie Mellon prizes diversity as one of its central values. Those speakers, comedians, and other guests who we pay to have come to our campus should be aware of those values, whether or not they agree with them. 
Griffin’s jokes and actions, while entertaining to many in his audience, respected neither the university nor its values. While we know that the Activities Board was not responsible for Griffin’s behavior, we do hope it will keep the values of the university community in mind when choosing future guests, because racism labeled as “just a joke” is still inexcusable.

In less than a month, this year’s graduates will leave Carnegie Mellon’s campus, diplomas in hand. For more and more students, that diploma comes with a heavy burden of student debt. Last year, for the first time in history, the nation’s student debt surpassed credit card debt, breaking the $3 trillion mark. 
According to recent U.S. Department of Education data, the average price of attending a private, nonprofit institution outstrips available financial aid by more than $26,000 — a statistic that offers a clear explanation for the increase in students relying on loans for higher education. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, graduates who took out loans left college with an average of $24,000 in debt last year. Many may see student debt as a necessary means to a successful future career. Because, as Peter Thiel suggests, student debt could very well become the next debt crisis, students need to weigh the benefits of attending a top-ranked school against the costs of amassed student loans. This decision of whether or not to take out a loan, however, is hard to judge when every major university — Carnegie Mellon included — is working harder each year to convince each year’s prospective students that a high-quality education is worth the cost.
At the moment, it looks as if the earning potential of college graduates is, in fact, enough to cover the average student debt. According to a College Board report issued last fall, median earnings of bachelor’s degree recipients working full time year-round in 2008 were $55,700, or $21,900 more than the median earnings of high school graduates. For Carnegie Mellon, the median for a mechanical engineering major graduating with a bachelor’s degree is $90,000 yearly, while the median for a graduate with a bachelor’s degree in H&SS is $65,000, which are both well above the overall college median.
Either way, Carnegie Mellon students who are taking out loans and college students in general need to be aware of the time and money they are investing in their education. Students need to become fiscally aware during and especially after college, when they may need to forgo certain luxuries until their debts are paid off. Students can become fiscally aware by managing their money through free sites like Mint.com and by monitoring their student account and loans on Student Information Online. Getting a job in college to pay down the interest on student loans is also a good way to ensure that debt is not overwhelming after graduation. All these tactics can aid students in keeping debt under control and getting the most out of college. 
When one really evaluates the reason for attending college, it’s about preparing for a job and about gaining the knowledge to carry out a profession. Carnegie Mellon students in particular go to college with the motivation and intention of making a successful career in their chosen profession. When we graduate from this university, it will be with a wealth of knowledge that will allow us to succeed in future jobs and pay off pesky student debts.

Now that Carnival is over and we are preparing for final exams, it’s a good time to reflect on “academic apathy.” It’s that feeling that motivates you to BS your way through an assignment, to skip a class because perfect attendance is not required, or to procrastinate without much guilt. Academic apathy often results in doing the minimum amount of work required to meet the cutoff for a certain grade, and it detracts from learning. Academic apathy is usually caused by a lack of engagement in the class material, confusion, or an overbearing work load.
Academic apathy is inevitable around finals, when there is more work than time to do it well. Students are forced to prioritize their work and determine the minimum amount of time and effort to make a certain grade. This type of mentality makes it difficult for students to get engaged in the material. But even earlier in the semester, academic apathy was still prevalent. Carnegie Mellon is a tough school, and students often have to take classes in areas that they do not find interesting. Also, many students spread themselves thin over multiple majors and minors and many difficult classes, and this practice encourages, if not requires, the apathetic mindset of only doing the minimum amount of work.
The problem is that these factors are hard to and should not be changed. Carnegie Mellon should remain a difficult school, and it defeats the purpose of engaging students in class material if the class material has to be changed to make it more interesting. Also, if students are interested in having more than one major or picking up a minor, then denying them the opportunity to pursue those interests will make them even more apathetic. However, there are two ways that the administration and professors can increase engagement in class material without dramatically changing or taking away from other areas.
Tools to track progress:
In general, when you have a goal, you are more motivated to work toward that goal when there are clear and concrete steps to attaining it. For most Carnegie Mellon students, the goals are to earn high grades and, eventually, degrees. Professors and the administration can increase student engagement in classes by presenting students with clear and attainable, but still challenging, paths to reach their goals of high grades and degrees. Unfortunately, grading rubrics and methods will vary from professor to professor, and the course requirements for each major are complex and frequently changing. However, while the path may be intrinsically cloudy, professors and the administration can make it clearer by providing students with tools to monitor their progress in achieving high grades and degrees.
It’s great that most professors provide their students with a grading rubric, and tools like Academic Audit and ScheduleMan take out some of the anxiety students might have about meeting all the degree requirements, but there is still room for improvement. For example, teachers could make better and more frequent use of the grade book functionality on Blackboard. Carnegie Mellon could also develop a tool that maps out possible course plans for various majors and minors.
More emphasis on classes in Carnegie Mellon media:
The most important part of the undergraduate college experience is the classes, and Carnegie Mellon offers some of the best classes in the world. These classes should be celebrated, but most Carnegie Mellon official media, such as the Carnegie Mellon website, focus primarily on other things, such as extracurricular activities, faculty research, and alumni achievements. These things are important and deserve coverage, but the lack of coverage on classes implies that classes aren’t something to be excited about.
It would send students a more positive message about classes if Carnegie Mellon began covering more issues related to classes. For example, the university website could do a profile piece of a particular class, including interviews with the professor and some students, a summary of the material covered, and descriptions of some of the larger class projects. These ideas have little downside, but a lot of upside. Obviously, they won’t bring engagement up 100 percent, but they should encourage and enable students to become more interested in the class material.

The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) recently published the results of its annual survey in which it measures the salaries of various university professors and instructors. The published data includes the average salaries for full professors, associate professors, assistant professors, and instructors. The average full professor at Carnegie Mellon receives $138,900 per year, the highest salary of any university within a 100-mile radius. 
Despite the salary freeze in faculty members’ pay, our university’s employees are quite well off. In order for Carnegie Mellon to maintain its status as a fairly prestigious school, it must attract prominent members from each academic field away from other prospective universities. And since these professors are in high demand, the university must offer a high salary to win over these brilliant minds.
Within each university, however, professors from different disciplines receive widely varying salaries. The AAUP’s data has confirmed what has long been intuitively known: that professors in fields of law, computer science, engineering, and business receive higher salaries than those in other fields such as humanities, art, and drama. While some people believe that the position of university professor should receive the same salary, no matter the field, we see this pay distribution as fair and consistent considering the different requirements and market demand of each respective field.
A professor in electrical and computer engineering, for instance, probably has offers to work for many universities, in addition to high-profit companies; both of which can offer significant salaries for their skills and knowledge. To attract them away from such opportunities, the university must also offer a competitive wage to these potential employees. Meanwhile, positions for humanities-centered jobs are not in as high of a demand. For instance, non-teaching jobs for historians specializing in 17th-century French history are probably very limited. 
As a result of this low demand, a university does not have to offer as competitive a salary.
The difference in the demands for varying fields is the cause for the disparity in salaries. As unfortunate as it is that some professors receive a lower salary, despite all going through the same process to receive tenure, it is simply a fact of life that some fields are in more demand than others, and that professors in those fields are going to receive a greater salary than those in other fields. Equalizing full professors’ salaries within a university would be nice, but not economically viable.

“There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.” This quote is often attributed to Mark Twain, but it has taken on new meaning in the last few weeks.
In what has now become a somewhat famous error, Jon Kyl (R–Ariz.) stated on the Senate floor that over 90 percent of Planned Parenthood’s services are abortions, while the actual figure is only about 3 percent. Kyl’s press secretary, Ryan Patmintra, said the statistic “was not intended to be a factual statement,” a response that only a political aide could give. Last Friday, a week later, the aide retracted his comment, saying that it was “a comment that, in retrospect, made no sense.”
Senator Kyl should not be blamed for his aide’s gaffe. And while many politicians would fire a press secretary for making such an inane comment, Kyl has kept Patmintra on board. Whether this shows loyalty or just an inability to find a better aide, I don’t know, but everybody has bad days, and focusing on the press secretary is missing the point. Observers of politics should always take any statistic with several grains of salt. We assume that politicians will manipulate facts to serve their interests. Kyl’s attribution is in a league of its own, however. Over a week after his error, he claimed that he was thinking of a statistic he had read “out of context.”
First: It does not take a week to realize that such an absurd misrepresentation is out of context. I question whether Kyl was referencing a statistic he had read or if his reference to a study by the Chiaroscuro Foundation was researched after the fact. Second: Such a huge discrepancy between claim and reality is only possible if Kyl truly believes that Planned Parenthood might provide abortions as its primary service. This is just as disturbing as the original error and the aide’s response to it. “Not intended to be a factual statement,” despite its absurdity and later retraction, is probably the most accurate response by a political press secretary in years. While the primary purpose of studies and statistics should be to use facts to support an argument, Kyl was trying to use scare tactics to advance his ideological dogma. 
His utter disregard for the truth is unsurprising, but it is still disappointing.

A Los Angeles Times article from last week complained that Ikea, the Swedish home furniture manufacturer, is mistreating workers in its factory in Danville, Va. The LA Times noted that Ikea pays its workers in Sweden $15 an hour, allows them to unionize, and gives them five weeks of paid vacation days. 
But here in the U.S., Ikea pays its workers minimum wage, abhors unions, demands workers stay overtime, and gives them as few holidays as possible. This comes as a surprise to the general public because Ikea is seen as a company with a great reputation. It makes great products, pays workers well, meets environmental standards, and is generally a leader in corporate social responsibility. So why is the company they treating workers so poorly?
The answer is simple: Ikea is trying to maximize profit. Like any company, Ikea goes to almost any means to achieve this goal. This time, corporate cost-cutting is happening at the expense of American workers and suddenly American newspapers are “shocked” at how a company can treat workers so badly. 
People seem to forget how badly American companies treat their own workers in Nicaragua and other third-world countries, but when a foreign company does the same to the United States, the knives come out. The fact of the matter is that Americans are not used to being treated like Mexicans, and it hurts American pride when a company is able to do so blatantly and we can do nothing to stop it.
In a world where America is losing its grasp as the sole superpower, the stark reality is that the country will have to deal with scenarios in which it gets treated like a poor country. 
This may not happen all the time, but when it does, we need to be mature about it. Instead of displaying anger or disappointment, we need to realize that this is a simple side-effect of living in a world where corporations thrive on profit, not social responsibility.
So, as long as Ikea stays within the law, there is no point in crying about low wages and forced overtime. As the article itself mentions, Ikea brought much-needed jobs at a time when there were none. Let us take that as a positive and stop worrying about this non-issue.

You have been holding on to a secret for the past few weeks, and keeping it has been eating away at you. This week, be burdened no more: Tell a friend what’s on your mind and set yourself free.
A wise person once said something that only makes sense when you are seeking a particular piece of advice.
You need more culture in your life, dear Gemini. Having fun and hanging out is cool, but you need to take some time to enjoy the finer things in life.
Boy oh boy, do you have a lot of work to do this week. All I can say is “hop to it,” because there’s nothing in the stars that says your load will be lightened anytime soon.
The sun is out and Flagstaff awaits you. Go out, lie in the grass, and watch the clouds roll by.
This week your StumbleUpon will once again take your browser to the outer limits of the Internet. What you will find there will shock and amaze you. It will also give your computer a very bad virus.
There is a lot going on in your life, but this week, try being more perceptive about the world around you. You never know: You might just learn something about yourself that you didn’t know was there.
Your Carnival was interesting, to say the least. So interesting that instead of a prediction of what this week has in store, I think it would be pertinent just to remind you to go and look for clothes, because you DO have class.
Old friends are a gem to have, but it is in new friends that you keep re-exploring yourself and the world around you.
Don’t get carried away by sudden ideas and assumed information. Take some time to parse things out and get all the facts straight.
The finish line is close, so don’t do something that would cause you to trip and fall short of the end. Keep your focus and relax, and all will be okay.
Now that Spring Carnival is over, it’s time to call your mom and ask her how to get all of the paint, mud, Holi powder, and partying out of your clothes.
