With five out of six Match days played in the Champions League, it’s time to revisit the groups ahead of the final game to see and speculate on which teams will be progressing to the knockout stage of the competition.
Group A
Having secured their place in the knockout stage after their 3-1 victory against Salzburg on Matchday 4, Group A table-toppers Bayern Munich look comfortable heading into their final game against Lokomotiv Moscow. The same cannot be said for Atlético Madrid. Three consecutive draws mean that though they still sit at second in the table, Atléti cannot lose their final group stage match if they want to proceed to the knockout stage.
The Matchday 5 game between Bayern and Atléti was the most telling for Los Rojiblancos. Despite having home-field advantage and an A-team starting lineup, Atlético found themselves drawing against a Bayern side that started with mostly reserves. With the likes of Neuer and Lewandowski being left at home, along with Coman and Boateng staying on the bench, it was rather astonishing when Atlético failed to finish in front of Alexander Nübel again and again, with their only goal from João Félix in the 26th minute matched by a late penalty by Thomas Müller. Although Hansi Flick’s management and simple luck also played into the draw, the brunt of it still rests on Atléti’s inability to capitalize off the chances they create — a problem they will need to resolve if they want to make and remain in the knockout stage.
Group B
With both Borussia Mönchengladbach and Real Madrid fielding losses on Matchday 5, Group B suddenly looks very open. With just three points separating the top and bottom of the table, it will take the final matchday to determine which teams will proceed to the knockout stage.
Surprisingly, defending La Liga champions Real Madrid are sitting third in the table after a 2-0 loss to Shakhtar Donetsk on Matchday 5, which means Los Blancos must win their final game against Mönchengladbach to guarantee a place in the knockout stage. If Shakhtar can overcome Inter Milan, they will be through (it is also possible if Shakhtar draw and Real lose). Milan, on the other hand, will be looking to win against Shakhtar while praying for Real to lose (or draw, provided Milan wins by two goals). Top-of-the-table Mönchengladbach has the easiest job of the four — despite having dropped points due to a 3-2 loss against Inter, any result that is not a loss to Real on Matchday 6 would still put them through, and even a loss to Real coupled with an Inter Milan victory would do the job.
Group C
Unlike Group B, the two teams sitting at the top of the Group C table are very comfortable. The table has not changed since Matchday 2, and both Manchester City and Porto have already secured their place in the last-16 ahead of their final group stage games.
The only question left to answer in Group C is which team between Olympiacos or Marseille will have a conciliatory Europa league run, and which will be flying home. Marseille definitely has the more difficult job of the two, needing to achieve a better result than Olympiacos against a dangerous Manchester City side. In the event that both teams lose on Matchday 6, Marseille will need Olympiacos to lose by three goals more than the margin Marseille does in order to place third in the table off of goal difference.
Group D
Like Bayern and Manchester City, Liverpool have their spot at the top of the table, along with a spot in the knockout stage secured. Midtjylland, having only garnered a single point across the last five games, will see their European campaign come to an end.
The game to watch for Group D is the final match between Atalanta and Ajax. With Atalanta leading by a point in the table, the Italian side only needs to hold Ajax to a draw to advance to the last-16. Ajax, on the other hand, will be trying to capitalize off of home-field advantage, as they will need to take all three points to advance to second in the table and avoid a Europa league relegation.
Group E
The Group E table looks rather similar to the Group C table, with Chelsea and Sevilla comfortably at the top of the table with 13 and 10 points, respectively, mirroring City and Porto’s success. There is still some speculation left at the bottom of the table.
If Krasnodar can draw or win against Chelsea on Matchday 6, they will guarantee their place in the Europa league. If they lose, they will be hoping that Rennes draws or loses against Sevilla. Although it seems unlikely for Rennes to beat Sevilla while Krasnodar loses to Chelsea, it will be the result Rennes is looking for if they want to continue their European campaign.
Group F
With 10 points at the top of the table and second- and third-placed Lazio and Club Brugge facing each other on Matchday 6, Borussia Dortmund are poised to advance to the knockout stage regardless of their result against Zenit Saint Petersburg. Like Midtjylland, there is, unfortunately, little left for Zenit, who will be out of Europe following their final group stage game.
The situation between Lazio and Club Brugge mirrors the one between Atalanta and Ajax in Group D. Two points separate second-place Lazio from third-place Club Brugge, which means that Lazio only needs to hold Club Brugge off to a draw to advance to the last-16, while Club Brugge needs a win. With Lazio playing at home and having the points advantage to begin with, it will be an uphill battle for Club Brugge.
Group G
The Group G table is the least dramatic of all the tables. Barcelona, having won every group stage match so far, sits at the top with 15 points while Juventus, having only lost to Barça 2-0 on Matchday 2, sits in second with 12 points; both teams have long since secured their spots in the knockout stage. Dynamo Kyiv and Ferencvárosi remain at the bottom of the table, with only a point each after their 2-2 draw against each other on Matchday 2.
There is little suspense left in Group G for Matchday 6. Although Barça will face Juve at home, both teams will be cognizant that the results won’t matter much, as both teams have already qualified for the last-16. With Kyiv and Ferencvárosi playing each other and Kyiv leading by a single point of goal difference, Ferencvárosi will need to win against the home team for a shot at the Europa league, while Kyiv only needs a draw or better.
Group H
Group H will be the group to keep an eye out for on Matchday 6. With Manchester United, PSG, and Leipzig all tied with nine points each, the field is wide open. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for İstanbul Başakşehir. Despite an impressive 2-1 win against Manchester United on Matchday 3 and a thrilling 4-3 game loss against Leipzig on Matchday 5, the three points they’ve earned won’t be enough to keep their European campaign hopes alive.
Although the three teams at the top of the table are tied for points, their significant margins in goal difference create different win conditions. First-placed Manchester United will face third-placed Leipzig away, while PSG takes on İstanbul at home. Leipzig, with the worst goal difference of the top three, will need to beat Manchester United to stay in the Champions League, or draw and hope that PSG loses. United can afford to lose against Leipzig provided PSG does the same against İstanbul, but a neutral or positive result would guarantee Manchester United’s spot in the knockout stage. PSG can afford to lose to İstanbul if and only if Leipzig loses to United, and a victory would put them through to the last-16. If PSG draws, they will need the Manchester United-Leipzig game to end in anything but a draw.

Music was my substitute for therapy this year, as evidenced by my 105,312 minute total time spent listening to music on Spotify. As the year winds down, here are some of my favorite music from this year. This will include both music from 2020 and music I stumbled on in 2020. 
SAWAYAMA - Rina Sawayama (2020)
It’s hard to describe SAWAYAMA or box it into any genre, which plays into the overall aura Rina Sawayama created with this album. It’s an incredible blend of pop, electronic, alternative rock, metal, and R&B. Sawayama’s vocals are really memorable, and she is backed up by some equally memorable songwriting. A standout moment is the transition from a heavy, alt-metal style verse to a pop chorus reminiscent of Ariana Grande on the track “STFU!.” 
Demolisher - Slaughter to Prevail (2020)
I’ve been generally unfazed with heavy music. But then I discovered Slaughter to Prevail, a deathcore band created by Russian YouTuber vocalist Alex Terrible. This is one of the heaviest songs I’ve ever heard. The production is crisp, the drumming and riffs chug along and pack a major punch, and Alex Terrible delivers the best vocals I’ve heard on a metal track ever. I lost my mind when he started growling like a demon in Russian right before the band proceeded to demolish me with arguably the greatest breakdown I’ve heard.
color theory - Soccer Mommy (2020)
color theory is a dream-pop rollercoaster. There is a dark, melancholic, and eerie atmosphere that pervades each track, and it sounds like a crossover between Mitski and Crumb. It’s existential in a way that doesn’t feel forced, and Soccer Mommy’s sound is a large part of that. The soundscape is really dynamic, balancing out quiet moments with really theatrical psychedelic overload. It’s a journey that will simultaneously uplift and depress you. 
Antiphon - Alfa Mist (2017)
This album is a breath of fresh air for jazz fusion, seamlessly combining jazz, soul, R&B, and hip-hop. There is a great deal of depth and musicality to each track, with ethereal and haunting progressions, sensational solos, tight grooves from the rhythm section, and amazing vocals/rapping on the tracks that featured them. I read a comment about this album that said “I go to bed a richer man for discovering this,” and I agree with that sentiment. 
Predictions - 79.5 (2018)
This album sounds like what would happen if the Spice Girls made an R&B and soul album, and I mean that in the best possible way. For me, vocals are usually not my main focus of a song even when it’s a song that’s meant to showcase vocals. However, this album and SAWAYAMA are in the minority where I ended up primarily listening to it for the vocals. The songs are also ridiculously catchy. I had the album on repeat for three days the first time I listened to it. 
Yene Mircha - Hailu Mergia (2020)
This is a great exhibition of Ethiopian jazz from keyboardist Hailu Mergia, who has been around since the 1970s. This album blends big band music akin to Mingus and Ellington with Afro-Cuban jazz and traditional Ethiopian music. Mergia kills it on the keys, and his compositions are really intricate, effortlessly blending all the genres together while providing plenty of opportunities for the rest of the band to shine. I ended up listening to his earlier work, and it’s amazing to hear that he is still making music at the same quality as he did in the 1970s. 
K.G. - King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard (2020)
Another year, another King Gizz album. After blowing everyone’s minds last year with a thrash metal album, they’ve gone a bit closer back to their roots with some psychedelic rock with microtonal instruments. They’ve done this before on their album Flying Microtonal Banana, but they go an extra mile by continuing their genre experimentation. I didn’t know I wanted Parliament-style microtonal funk or microtonal doom metal or microtonal country, but King Gizz gave them to me and I am very happy that they did. 
I Disagree - Poppy (2020)
Poppy made a metal album, and it’s really good. It’s also insane. Within one song, it will go from electronic to deathcore to pop-metal back to deathcore to straight pop to pop-metal again to pop-rock, and it works. While she’s at it, she is also creating better breakdowns than most metal bands today. This is a bizarre and chaotic album, and I am really excited to see what other crazy music she brings after this. 
RTJ4 - Run the Jewels (2020)
Come on, it’s Run the Jewels. This album is incredible. Everything is a step up from what they’ve done before. The beats are really slick and creative, and the production is off the charts. Killer Mike and El-P deliver some of their best bars in their career. On each track, there was always a moment where I was making that face you make like you’ve smelled dirty socks because of how nasty the track was. 
Acabou Chorare - Novos Baianos (1972)
This is the year I have become obsessed with Brazilian music, particularly bossa and Brazilian popular music (MPB), which blends bossa and other Brazilian genres with elements from jazz and rock. Novos Baianos is one of the earliest groups to revolutionize MPB, and it’s easy to see why. Acabou Chorare, and every other Novos Baianos album for that matter, are really musically rich and dense, with melodies that you’ll be humming for days. The instrumentation and production are mind-blowing. It sounds like a talented group of people with an unparalleled passion for music spontaneously came together to record something and it’s special. 
Terminal Redux - Vektor (2016)
Vektor is easily my favorite metal band and was my top artist of the year. Their brand of progressive thrash metal is unbelievably innovative, with some of the most relentless and creative songwriting I’ve heard in the genre and in general. Usually, most bands will do harmonies for their melody lines, but Vektor takes it to a whole other level by doing harmonies with their chord-based riffs to make it sound like there are six guitars at once. Throw all of that together with blistering guitar solos, thundering drums, and an amazing space opera concept and you get Terminal Redux. This is probably the best metal album of the last thirty years and every metal fan should check this out. 
Titanic Rising - Weyes Blood (2019)
Stumbling upon Titanic Rising is one of the highlights of 2020 for me. This is a beautiful and lush tapestry, combining the grandiose compositions of 1970s psychedelic music with modern indie pop while sprinkling in elements of baroque and classical music. This has quickly become one of my favorite pieces of music and I find myself drifting away every time I listen to any song off this album. In a year that has been filled with so much cruelty, despair, and horror to the point of parody, Titanic Rising was a reminder of why, despite everything, there may be hope for us.

Senior Fellow at the Institute for Politics and Strategy (IPS) Richard Grenell has been known for working closely with President Trump in pushing a “peace through strength” approach in Europe. His work as Ambassador to Germany and as Special Envoy for Kosovo-Serbia, along with his social media presence, has come under fire particularly at Carnegie Mellon since his appointment as Senior Fellow in July 2020. Students have petitioned for his position at the IPS to be rescinded. Recently, students implored  the administration to hold Grenell accountable for his actions and behavior after the university hired him.
On Tuesday, Dec. 1, the Center for International Relations and Politics within IPS held a conversation with Grenell as part of its ongoing Policy Forum series. In attendance were many students and faculty from Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh, IPS director Kiron Skinner, and other members of the community.
The talk centered on Kosovo-Serbia relations. Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia in 2008 but Serbia recognizes it not as an independent state, but as an autonomous province. Since then, relations between the two have been nonexistent until recent years, where it has become tense and controversial; even on the forum’s Youtube livestream, a user named “The Serbs” wrote in the chat that “kosovo is serbia dear brothers [sic]” and that the “Serbian army saved over 250 American pilot [sic] during the first world war,” imploring fellow viewers to “read about it please.”
The actual conversation with Grenell was nowhere near as charged. In fact, he was very thorough in his answers, occasionally glancing down to check his notes.
The first half of the conversation consisted of introductions and some background from Grenell on diplomacy between Serbia and Kosovo. Grenell shared that since he was very close to President Trump and the Secretary of State, both sides had reached out to him and expressed a desire for “high-level attention” during their negotiations. According to Grenell, both sides discussed future growth and economic development, in particular a frustration that there is not a focus on developing the region.
Grenell was able to secure a team from the State Department and a smaller team consisting of staff working at the embassy in Berlin, some of whom had been stationed in the Balkans before. “We weren’t at that point of creating a political solution,” said Grenell, so the team instead focused on economic growth: getting people jobs, helping people look toward the future and stop "lingering on the past”. Grenell credits the motivation for an emphasis on economic growth to his trip to Kosovo and Serbia after their initial meeting in Berlin. He could not fly directly from Pristina to Belgrade; the airspace had not allowed for commercial flights for the past 20 years. 
The negotiations were tough, Grenell shared, since even addressing the two sides was controversial. However, three agreements on air, railway, and motor travel were signed at the Munich Security Conference last winter. This is, he says, a good basis for getting larger agreements like the Economic Normalization Agreement, which needs the US government to “dig deep on funding.”
Some of the economic projects they discussed involved different US departments. The example Grenell provided was a lake mostly in Kosovo, but also in Serbia. The lake was underutilized for energy. Around the lake, there is also room for development. So, they approached the Department of Energy to fund a feasibility study.
Political problems began to creep in, including some related to land ownership. However, since many of the issues were related to EU membership, the US did not get involved. Instead, Grenell’s team reminded the two presidents that Serbia and Kosovo had to implement the projects, which will appeal to the EU, of which Serbia and Kosovo are not yet members.
Grenell emphasized two points before the floor was opened for questions: first, land swaps were never discussed, and second, both sides agreed to diversify their energy sources. The EU believes that diversification of energy, in this case pulling away from Russia, is crucial “to have the freedom that they need politically.” The goal would be to secure a “freedom to make political decisions without having to feel the leverage of energy.” Here, Grenell also noted that a monumental lesson from the ENA was that the best way to reach a consensus was to use simple language.
The question and answer portion started off with Post-Doctoral Fellow Daniel Silverman’s inquiry regarding the greater issues at stake here, and where the Serbia-Kosovo relationship fits in a broader context. After emphasizing that Kosovo and Serbia could be greater allies for the US, Grenell brought the audience's attention to their autonomy. For example, Grenell is “a believer that both Serbia and Kosovo should be able to handle their own court systems,” so he says the rule of law needs to be handled internally, not, for example, outsourced to the Hague. Grenell says this would help political dynamics and save money, noting that the US has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on international courts. Accordingly, the US will continue to mentor judges and run bilateral programs in both Serbia and Kosovo to make sure that the two are governing under their own rule of law. Here, Grenell also elaborated that the problem includes a “perceived conflict,” adding that the US should reconsider the placement of the more than 600 troops currently in Kosovo, and move the region away from an “international emergency room situation.”
Silverman also enquired about the economics-first approach; in particular, what forces will sustain an agreement without the US commitments seen in the Middle East. Grenell shared that this required political will from Serbia and Kosovo was intentional; he wanted to respect other countries enough to let them determine what would work, and the US cannot do anything unless the two parties themselves consider the plan to be useful and beneficial. Grenell has also seen that regional leaders drop back and are less driven to contribute when the US tries to be the problem solver. Hence, Grenell believes that having the US government commit to being there for a short time and essentially provide seed money will be more conducive to kickstarting the region and removing the “cycle of dependency on our foreign aid” than would the past focus on political remediations, which Grenell holds did not work — both sides have been very frustrated that the steps to EU membership have been taking too long and are not specific enough. Grenell noted that a lot of business leaders are already interested in being a part of this economic development. According to Grenell, both sides have been eager to make progress across the board.
In response to a question on an article from The New York Times, Grenell asserted that “all reporters are biased.” This bias, he says, is not always negative, but journalists need to be upfront about bringing in their real-world experiences, and consumers need to be responsible in getting their news from more than one source.
An audience member expressed his doubt regarding the Serbian and Kosovar openness to Grenell’s approach. Grenell remarked that they are very eager to have jobs and raise their families in the region they love, instead of moving to, say, Germany or Hungary. This led Grenell’s team to interact with the private sector before ever going to the Presidential Palace. They heard from the business community, for example a car rental company frustrated because their customers couldn’t drive their cars across the border. In essence, political issues were holding back the economy. Their work with the media has also created a vision of bringing companies and jobs to the region, for which he said both sides were “hungry” and grateful.
Grenell was then asked how his role in transatlantic relations would change with the new presidency. While he did not share his expectations for his career, he did remark that a new team would be helpful for the situation. He posits that Washington, D.C. is not very good at having different perspectives; they like to have familiar people who have been there for a long time. However, Grenell believes that people with new perspectives will be more helpful than people with 20 years of experience: “if we had an expert class that knew exactly what to do in the Balkans, we would have solved this 19 years ago.” If the new team decides the time is right to address political issues, he advises the new team to make sure the Europeans are in control. However, the new team will not be able to abandon the economic emphasis since both sides are so excited about it.
The next question asked for Grenell’s insights regarding the state of US diplomacy and the Foreign Service. Grenell recommended his own article, published in The Hill. He said that currently, problems are dealt with by sending in the troops and letting the Department of Defense take care of everything. Rather, he said, we should have the State Department send diplomats with muscle first, and send the troops last. Fewer diplomats should be in European capitals and more in danger zones. The State Department should also do less political reporting and instead, focus on serving the American people through economic development. In that sense, he says, he believes our embassies should be “many chambers of commerce,” and they should be creating jobs for Americans. The economic “cone,” or division, at the embassies should also be expanded.
The next question saw Grenell double down on the economic emphasis. When asked about why they kept the EU separate from these conversations, Grenell revealed that one of his superiors in the State Department, who is in charge of the Balkans, works very closely with the EU, and they have tied in some political issues as well. For example, the ENA achieved a year-long freeze from both sides on derecognition of Kosovo and seeking membership in the EU. This is a big political win, according to Grenell, since this would remove concerns on the longevity and functionality of economic agreements.
The legal status of said agreements was also questioned; one attendee enquired whether foreign companies would take advantage of the new agreements. Grenell noted that the US did not sign the agreements, saying that both sides came to this with a strong political will and clear economic priorities. Grenell then said the US did not fund the projects because that would create an incentive for foreign companies to come in and leave without any long term strategy. Therefore, the US is doing seed money guarantees, which forces the private sector in the region to come in and invest itself. Grenell argued that economic growth would thus be stimulated by Serbia and Kosovo, not the US.

President Farnam Jahanian issued a statement on Nov. 18 responding to a student letter asking for Richard Grenell to be held accountable for his actions after being hired as Senior Fellow for the Institute for Politics and Strategy (IPS). President Jahanian's letter characterized Grenell's posts on social media, which have been seen as spreading misinformation and sinophobic, as expressions of Grenell's right to free speech. He also mentioned the formation of a new Commission on Academic Freedom and Freedom of Expression, which was further elaborated on in his Dec. 3 statement.
While there was controversy over Grenell's hiring in August, Grenell's recent actions are now seen in a different light. As an employee of Carnegie Mellon, he is now also subject to the Code of Business Ethics and Conduct. Many have argued that his actions as a Senior Fellow have been in violation of the policies outlined in the document, including the clause to conduct "all business and related professional activities in good faith and with fairness, accuracy, integrity and respect for others."
"One big requirement of the code of conduct, at this university, is the principle of respect for persons," said Denise Rousseau, who was on the committee that evaluated Grenell's appointment in August. "The idea that in our behavior, that we show a sort of respect for the integrity the value the autonomy of the other humans with whom we work, or who are in the public, because one of the features of academic freedom is it's not unconditionally given, that there are responsibilities as well as rights."
She added that "it's one thing to criticize what Mr. Grenell has done prior to coming because he wasn't a CMU staff member. It is another world once he's here."
Some are concerned about the misinformation Grenell has spread on social media and are uncertain whether his speech and behavior as a representative of the university should be viewed as a First Amendment issue. 
Rousseau and Lisa Tetrault, an associate professor of history, reference the "falsely yelling fire in a crowded theater" analogy from the Schenck v. United States ruling used to illustrate the harm caused by false and dangerous speech, which, under the ruling and subsequent rulings, is not protected under the First Amendment. 
"Speech that people make doesn't have to be truthful. Doesn't have to be trustworthy, freedom of speech means we can say what we want, as long as we don't say it in a way that it actually imposes immediate harm like calling fire in a crowded theater." She adds that "academic freedom is different because one of the issues and obligations in academic freedom is the issue of truth telling."
"An institution of higher education should be a defender of facts," Tetrault said, "and Mr. Grenell's behavior distorts facts." 
However, some, including President Jahanian, believe that Grenell's behavior is not dangerous enough to merit being categorized as a threat, and that his hiring and actions after being hired are protected under First Amendment rights.
"Although CMU is a private institution, we uphold the First Amendment right of freedom of expression for all students, faculty and staff through our Freedom of Expression policy, as do almost all of our peer private institutions," said President Jahanian in a statement to The Tartan. "There are limited exceptions to this protection, including speech that would qualify under the First Amendment as harassment, obscenity, defamation, and 'true threats' (e.g., inciting violence or threatening harm to a specific individual). These exceptions typically have been enforced very narrowly by the courts, recognizing the fundamental role that free speech plays in our democracy."
Randal Bryant, who was also on the committee that reviewed Grenell’s hiring, shares a similar sentiment. Bryant says that the original report "cited a 70-year-old definition of academic freedom that called for people, in everything they do, to be respectful of others. And I still think that's an ideal that we should strive for.” “Honestly,” he continued, “I think Mr. Grenell would have more impact [if] he did so.”
However, Bryant says that since the report’s publishing, he’s come to understand that the years-old definition of academic freedom might not hold today. He stated a “few court cases regarding academic freedom that have been more in the direction of saying, ‘you really can't abridge First Amendment rights, even for academics.’” Because of this, Bryant says the university should “move then to an idea of saying ‘you should be respectful for others, but we're not allowed to make rules that abridge people's rights.’"
President Jahanian has created the Commission on Academic Freedom and Freedom of Expression to discuss the issues raised by Grenell's actions after the university hired him. However, academic freedom does not necessarily equate to freedom of expression; different individuals on campus disagree on whether it is academic freedom, the First Amendment's right to freedom of speech, or both that are at question here.
"We recognize that the two closely linked but distinct values of academic freedom and freedom of expression are not absolute, and that the boundaries that historically have applied to each should be further examined in today’s context,” President Jahanian said in his Dec. 3 statement on the new Commission on Academic Freedom and Freedom Expression. “However,” the statement continued, “together they serve as the foundations of what we do at Carnegie Mellon."
Bryant said that the August committee "did not do an in-depth study of the issue" and that as a member of the new commission, he believes part of the purpose of the commission is to "come to a fuller understanding of what academic freedom is and what its implications are."
"I think it's especially an important question now because of social media and things have really changed a lot in terms of how people communicate, what style they use, and so forth," Bryant said. "I think its rhetoric is designed, as a lot of Twitter rhetoric is designed, to sort of fire up his base and get them excited and rile up his opponents." He adds that "it's certainly not a very useful way to converse and talk or raise arguments. But then he does have First Amendment rights and I think that we have to be very careful."
Some have expressed concern over the idea that Grenell should face punitive action. Tetrault expressed that while she did not particularly care about what would happen to Grenell, she believed that the university should take a stand against his actions, as "to not condemn his actions perpetuates the erosion of democracy." Paul Eiss, associate professor of history, wrote in a letter to the editor a similar request asking that President Jahanian directly address students’ concerns of whether Grenell's actions infringed upon Carnegie Mellon's values.
Grenell's hiring has raised many questions over the rights and responsibilities of his ambiguous academic position that IPS director Kiron Skinner created for Grenell, and who should be involved in the appointment of staff members, as the current structure leaves most of the decision-making power to the department head. 
"He's a staff member. He's not an academic," Rousseau said. She described that while "these freedom issues clearly apply to any faculty member," those rules do not necessarily apply to staff members. Grenell’s position on campus is comparable to a researcher in the Robotics Institute or the Software Engineering Institute, which are funded by outside sources like the Department of Defense. IPS is primarily funded by conservative organizations like the Scaife Foundation and the Bradley Foundation, and Grenell, as a research employee whose position is funded by outside sources, may not have the same responsibilities as a tenured professor. 
"You'll never fully understand your organization's processes and procedures until you have a challenging case, until you have somebody who is different from the other people who've gone through the process or procedure in the past," Rousseau said. "It provides us a way of learning about our processes and learning about our practices and where we're fuzzy and we need to be clearer." She felt the core values of Carnegie Mellon are "being reaffirmed by this process. I don't feel they're threatened at all. I think they're being activated again, activated in a real salient way."

At the close of every school year, The Tartan assesses the year’s events. We present here a list of people and happenings that are worthy of recognition. Thistles go to people and events that had a positive effect on the campus community and the world at large; thorns, to those that have had a negative impact.
A thistle to The Tiger King. Setting aside all jokes and memes (and, yes, Carole Baskin TikTok dances), the show provided not only entertainment but also awareness of the abuse of large cats. This even led to the House passing a ban on the private ownership and trading of large cats.
A thorn to the obvious: the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Who would have thought that a novel virus could instantaneously wreak havoc on the entire world? 
A thistle to the larger support for POC-owned businesses. In this year, support for Black-owned businesses increased more than 7,000 percent.
A thorn to the repeated cases of police brutality. This is nothing new, but the increasing video footage is.
A thistle to all of the people who continue to advocate for Black lives. The protests earlier in the year were overwhelmingly peaceful and garnered support from the majority. Some of the energy has fizzled, but people continue to work toward making a more fair justice system.
A thorn to the lack of policy changes that ensued, that failed to adequately persecute the officers responsible for such violence and that have not fundamentally changed a racist system of policing and incarceration. 
A thistle to the end of The Apprentice: White House Edition... we mean, the Trump administration. Thanks to each and every person who cast their ballots, phone bankers, poll workers, and everyone in between. You helped contribute to the historic and record-breaking number of votes.
A thorn to the inaction in our federal government, especially in light of the current pandemic. From gross underplaying of the danger of the virus to lack of protection needed to combat the virus, people have taken a much larger hit than necessary. Evictions are picking up and food bank lines are getting longer, but the feds insist a one time payment of $1200 is enough to last you eight months.
A thistle to the students, faculty, and staff who spoke out against Grenell’s words and behavior. Extra thistle to Rico Hatch for writing a diss track on Grenell and IPS’s decision to hire him. 
A thorn to Richard Grenell.
A thistle to all the baking expeditions that took place this year, especially during this quarantine. Looks like we don’t need to be in a white tent to become Star Bakers!
A thorn to the exacerbated loneliness epidemic. We know it’s not easy, but we’re proud of everyone doing their best in helping flatten the curve. 
A thistle to making new friends over Zoom that we otherwise would never have met.
A thorn to all the people who still refuse to wear masks and social distance. 
A thistle to the creative content that emerged from quarantine boredom. From TikTok dances to Ratatouille: the Musical, the internet has been somewhat redeemed.
A thorn to whatever antics Netflix is onto. Removing great shows and movies but insisting that Cuties stays? Raising prices? Get yourself together!
A thistle to the unused textbooks in my house. You found new life propping up my laptop.
A thorn to the bots buying all the new Playstations. Like many things in 2020, the next generation of games will have to wait until next year.
A thistle to local journalists. They’ve spent the year working to cover the pandemic, the protests for Black lives, and the election. Subscribe to your favorite sources when you get a chance.
A thorn to Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms for failing to combat disinformation and for showing that we would be better off without them. Extra thorns go out to all the people on Twitter who like to ruin everything. 
A thistle for workers’ power. Hospital workers from the medical specialists to the support staff have shown courage under fire. Additionally, strikes around the world, like 250 million workers in India, demonstrate the collective power to demand basic health and safety.
And a final, a special thorn to the issue our generation has never lived without:
A thorn to climate inaction, which has impacted the severity of the wildfires in California, increased the frequency and deadliness of storms, and resulted in more extreme summers and winters. Extra thorns to those who continue to do little in the face of climate disaster.

If your mental health is strained, join the club. Attending school in these circumstances has been awfully isolating for me, and I'm not alone. I don’t know any students who are doing stellar; frankly, I’m amazed by anyone who has turned their assignments in on time. While Carnegie Mellon has done a good job of transitioning to an online model and emphasizing COVID-19 protocols, Carnegie Mellon has failed to adequately address the ailing mental health of its student body during the pandemic. 
Despite the administration’s rhetoric that “we’re in this together,” the administration has tasked students with handling full course loads on a business-as-usual basis. To me, this seems absurd, out of touch, and inhumane. Not only has fear of COVID-19 impeded the productivity of students, but the closure of public space and necessitated solitude have led to relationships withering and made it extremely difficult to lead balanced lifestyles. Considering these hardships, I don’t think it’s right to expect students to do the same amount of work on the same flawless, expedited, and mechanized basis as they did before the pandemic. 
Personally, I'm just not capable of being as engaged online as I was in-person or as productive at home as I was in libraries. And by no means am I as motivated to stay up late. Zoom is cool and all, but I find it difficult to focus — or even care — when my anxiety is more tangible than my classroom. 
Early on, authority figures talked about fighting a war against the virus. Though this discourse has subsided, I think it provides a helpful anecdote. Attempting to study, learn, and write in the past nine months has been like trying to read Tolstoy while standing in the middle of an active warzone. We’re constantly worrying about survival, so the learning process is consistently disrupted.
Students are living amid horror at a colossal scale. Hundreds of Americans have died every day for the past six months, and the death toll keeps rising. This ongoing catastrophe is more horrifying and absurd than a typical distraction. I’ve been so occupied with coursework that I’ve often forgotten about the victims. For this, I feel guilty and shell-shocked.
Carnegie Mellon has long had a mental health crisis on their hands, and it is now more pertinent than ever. The American Psychological Association recently sounded the alarm that America is “facing a national mental health crisis that could yield serious health… consequences for years to come.” Their annual survey of Stress in America concluded that Gen Z adults (age 18-23) have been impacted more than other age group and “are the most likely to [be] experiencing common symptoms of depression.” 
75% of the Gen Z. adults surveyed by the APA reported that in the past two weeks they “felt so tired they sat around and did nothing.” Seventy-five percent! My god! That is honestly just astonishing. I find it incredible that such a large majority of people my age feel the same way as me. Loneliness is such a lonely emotion! 
Additionally, 73% reported that they “felt lonely,” 74% “felt very restless,” and 73% “found it hard to think properly or concentrate.” I find the trends observed by the APA to be extremely concerning, and I think that everyone should know about this health crisis.
These times might be unprecedented, but Carnegie Mellon can and must do better to support the mental health of students. As far as I know, Carnegie Mellon has not even tried to evaluate the scope of this concerning trend. Earlier this semester, Carnegie Mellon urged all students to complete a survey about the semester. Yet this survey made no mention of mental health, and most responses were constrained to Likert scales. If Carnegie Mellon’s administration wants to know how we are feeling, they can ask us.
The few ways that Carnegie Mellon currently addresses mental health are insufficient. Typically, student well-being and mental health is only mentioned once in class; on the first day, when professors read through a “take care of yourself” clause that is on the last page of every syllabi. This paragraph was mandated after two students died by suicide in March of 2016. But I've often found this “take care of yourself” paragraph to be more ominous than comforting. It reads like a side-effects label and seems to imply that “CMU will not take care of you.” 
I’ve attended Carnegie Mellon for over 4 years, and I can’t think of any significant attempts to address mental health on campus. The days in which petting zoos are brought to campus have been titled “Mental health check-ins”, but that’s nothing more than a misguided joke. Carnegie Mellon students are urged to reach out to Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS). But solely relying on therapy frames mental health problems as the problems of individuals and undermines how common these experiences are among students. This totally contradicts Carnegie Mellon’s emphasis on community. 
I’ve gone to therapy for symptoms relating to anxiety and depression the whole time I’ve been at Carnegie Mellon. It's been great for me, but I know that therapy can be intimidating and difficult. And it is not a sufficient fix to a systemic problem. 
Broadly, I’ve felt that Carnegie Mellon fails to recognize students as complex human beings who are as capable of confusion and hurt as they are of brilliance. I've met professors and administrators who are incredibly compassionate and empathetic, but the student experience as a whole remains harsh, cold, and isolating. 
Sometimes it seems like students are expected to be machines. And somehow, in my four years here, I've come to accept this. But I want to refute this inhumane standard. It shouldn't be this way! It shouldn’t be so hard for Carnegie Mellon students to get out of bed in the morning.
I wish to leave my fellow students, for whom I feel so much compassion, with a few lyrics from a rock artist, Weyes Blood. “Don't cry, it's a wild time to be alive.” Please be easy on yourselves in the next two weeks. 
And to the administrators, who I hope read this, I understand that it is by no means easy to support the mental health of students. I also get that it won’t change overnight — but there are simple ways to try: 
Professors should be encouraged to bring their full humanity to the classroom, even when it is digital. I think professors should take time at the beginning of class to ask us how we’re doing. If something big happens in the news — like a shooting — ask how we’re feeling about it. It might seem futile, but nodding to our complex lives beyond the class can make a huge difference.
Additionally, I think that all professors should be compassionate and lenient with deadlines. Professors should actively encourage their students to reach out if they’re having any trouble because many students feel uncomfortable taking up the space required to reach out. 
I think that the administration should encourage all professors to compress syllabi in order to accommodate the online model and the tumultuous atmosphere. Our professors are very enthusiastic and want us to learn everything, but we just can't. If the learning goals don’t accommodate the impediments that students are facing, then we have no hope of meeting them. My peers and I have found this to be frustrating and overwhelming.
Give students the option to take all of their classes pass/fail until a vaccine is widely available. The pass/fail option is just as sensible now as it was in March. While we might not be taken off-guard by the virus, we’re all still constrained to a mere semblance of the lives that we once enjoyed. To most people I know, grades have been sources of stress rather than motivation, and ultimately, impeded the learning process.

On July 2, President Jahanian shared a letter titled “Confronting Racism and Promoting Equity and Inclusion” after nearly two months of petitions, town halls, and outcry from students, staff, and faculty alike. Reading the plan on that summer afternoon was the first time in months that I had some hope for the state of Carnegie Mellon University — and above all, the institution’s commitment to advocating for all students from every lived experience.
That feeling was short-lived.
When students at Carnegie Mellon so desperately needed action instead of words, advocacy instead of ignorance, empathy instead of cruelty, Carnegie Mellon administrators missed the mark this semester. From the very first day of classes to the final week, the Carnegie Mellon community has faced negligence wrapped in emails with platitudes of caring and understanding.
What does building an “inclusive culture that promotes equity for all and is intolerant of racism, discrimination, and bias” look like? Not a lot of people know — myself included. However, I know what it doesn’t look like. 
It is certainly not the dead-end investigation on the vandalism of The Fence that happened on the first day of class; and neither is the university’s lackluster initial response which affirmed that Black Lives Matter, but lacked the urgency and care the situation necessitated. Rather than doing the work to mend the wounds, it was up to students to defend the Fence overnight, to spread the message throughout the entire Pittsburgh campus that Black lives matter at Carnegie Mellon. It was up to Black students to create a virtual space for community members to reflect, to feel sad, and to be angry. 
The biggest grievance on the minds of many Carnegie Mellon students, staff, and faculty is this institution’s inability — or rather, refusal — to do something meaningful about the reprehensible hiring of Richard Grenell. Instead of admitting that the hiring was at least irresponsible, the university has defended the racist, xenophobic, and factually incorrect statements made by Grenell with ‘free speech’ rhetoric that doesn’t address the issue of content. Again, it was up to students to write letters and petitions. It was up to alumni to stop their donations and encourage others to do the same. It was up to staff and faculty to write and personally sign a letter against Grenell’s hiring. To much of our disappointment, the university has failed to step up in ways other than adding another commission or committee to their growing roster. 
My last bit of hope vanished when the university announced its compromise between Student Senate and the University Education Council: the ability to elect a course for pass/fail grading as part of the voucher process and an extra late drop voucher for the academic year. I admit that this is better than simply ignoring student senators and students who have been advocating for a more understanding grading policy during a pandemic, but it is not enough. Carnegie Mellon students have notoriously struggled with mental health issues on top of a stressful class schedule; when you throw in a pandemic that has been handled in a dangerously irresponsible manner, a decreased access to staff, faculty, and campus resources, and the inevitable unforeseen circumstances that exist in a virtual world, this struggle is multiplied by a thousand. It should not be ludicrous to suggest that maybe we need a grading policy similar to the one presented in the Spring 2020 semester — and students agree, as noted in a petition that gained over a thousand signatures. It is embarrassing to see my university decide against empathy, understanding, and kindness for the sake of prestige or academic rigor. It is shameful.
For clarification, there is good work happening at Carnegie Mellon — specifically from Black and Indigenous people of color (BIPOC) staff, faculty, and students who often do not get the credit they deserve. I want to make it clear that I know this work is happening and I am proud of it. It is Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, and staff that make me proud to be a Tartan — not the structures of this institution that have been inherently complicit to racism, sexism, elitism, and more. 
Students have had the fear that Carnegie Mellon does not care about anything that threatens their bottom line goals and opportunities for profit; however, in a short span of four months, this university has proven itself guilty as charged. It makes some of us angry, sad, and disappointed that a school we pay to attend, that we are supposed to be proud of, will not give us the time of day. To me, it is unbearably heartbreaking.
