Carnegie Mellon’s ultimate Frisbee team competed in the Western Pennsylvania Conference Tournament this past weekend. Going in as the third seed, the team successfully advanced to the Ohio Valley Regionals.
“Our goal this conference was to hold seed to continue onto regionals next weekend,” said senior Daniel Kotovsky.
The A team, Mr. Yuk, finished strong on Saturday with wins over West Virginia University, Edinboro University, and Shippensburg University.
“We were able to soundly beat two teams lower than us, bringing us to the most important game of the weekend against Shippensburg — who play on par with us and defeated us last year in the game to go to regionals,” Kotovsky said.
This year will be the first time in five years that Carnegie Mellon has made it to regionals. Mr. Yuk hopes to show how much the Frisbee program has improved over the years.
“We only need to win one more game tomorrow [Sunday] ... and we’ll be spending our next weekend on the beautiful fields of Manheim, Pa., playing against the highest-caliber teams of the Pennsylvania and Ohio region,” Kotovsky said after the team’s three wins on Saturday.
It’s a Carnegie Mellon ultimate Frisbee tradition after every win to give a hard hat to the player who worked the hardest during the game, and the player gets to place a Mr. Yuk sticker on it. The last three winners were graduate student Robbie Paolini, graduate student Akshay Krishnamurthy, and senior Anthony Rice.
The team lost to the University of Pittsburgh on Sunday, but defeated Indiana University of Pennsylvania 13–6 to clinch a third-place finish in the tournament and a spot in the regional tournament.

Now that the NBA playoffs are underway, it is also time to crown the regular-season winners for the various NBA awards — none greater than the Most Valuable Player award. Many commentators and NBA fans have already decided on who the MVP should be, and the almost universal pick for this prestigious award is the Chicago Bulls’ starting point guard, Derrick Rose.
The rise of both the Bulls and Rose this year is well documented. The team finished the regular season with the NBA’s best record, and Rose increased his scoring by five points, his three-point percentage by 7 percent, and his assists by 1.7 per game. For a team that was the eighth seed just a year ago, the Bulls’ atomic rise through the standings has been one of the biggest stories of the year in the NBA.
So, with such a great improvement for an already good player and a team that has the best record in the league, D-Rose is clearly the MVP, right? Not so fast.
Although I do think Rose should be the MVP of the league this year, it’s a tragedy that Dwight Howard has not gotten more support for it. Howard, who was just named the Defensive Player of the Year for the third straight year, has become the whole Orlando team. As seen in the playoffs, no one else on the team can bring the Magic to a victory over a good team other than Howard. Known as “Superman,” Howard had 45 points and 19 rebounds in Game 1 against the same Atlanta Hawks team that the Magic destroyed just last year in the second round of the playoffs, but the Magic still somehow lost. I know the playoffs don’t count for these regular-season awards, but voters simply can’t overlook what is happening in Orlando. Howard also increased his scoring per game, and he is the first player in league history to lead the league in rebounds and blocks two years in a row. 
With the improvement of both players this season, it’s tough to give out this award purely based on stats. Both players do so much for their teams, and at entirely different positions as well. Many people decide who the Most Valuable Player should be by trying to determine who actually means the most to his team, which always presents a good argument. If this route is how the MVP is chosen, Howard clearly means more to his team. Few people realize that D-Rose has a lot of help in Chicago, with extremely good role players like Kyle Korver, Luol Deng, Carlos Boozer, and Joakim Noah helping him shoulder the load. For the Magic, there is a solid point guard in Jameer Nelson and a few aging stars in Jason Richardson and Hedo Turkoglu, who are well past their prime. Both players averaged 26 percent of their team’s total points, yet Howard’s impact on the defensive side of the ball is clearly more valuable to the team than Rose’s impact. 
Additionally, people tend to overlook the impact of the Bulls’ new coach, Tom Thibodeau. “Tibs,” as he is known, has brought a defensive mindset to the Bulls that only a few coaches in the league can teach. Just a year ago, the Bulls were a middle-of-the-pack defensive team, and they are now the No. 1 defense in the league by far. Factor in that they signed a subpar defensive player in Boozer, and the impact of Tibs cannot be underestimated. Meanwhile, Howard plays on a team with no other good defenders, and he has to man the paint while his teammates routinely put him in bad positions against some of the best guards in the league. Again, Howard’s defensive presence cannot be taken lightly.
However, despite the facts and arguments presented, Rose is the NBA MVP. With the leadership he has shown this season, along with his uncanny ability to end games with ridiculous drives to the basket, Rose has earned the right to this award. One could argue that without Rose’s attitude towards defense, this team may have not taken on the personality of its coach and wouldn’t be close to the best defensive team in the league. Rose leads his team with toughness, willingness to learn, and his unmatched desire to become the best player he can be. I definitely agree with the public on Rose, but NBA fans need to take the time to realize just how good Superman’s season also was.

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Tammi Wilson Stadium for the Opening Day 2020 matchup between the Pittsburgh Pirates and your Milwaukee Brewers! Here now to throw the first pitch is Tammi Wilson herself, winner of MLB.com’s Twitter sweepstakes to rename the ballpark and start as pitcher for the team of her choice! Let’s hear a big round of applause for Tammi and her winning tweet: “I luv da #Brewers nd I wud luv to kiss Ryan Braun hes such a qtie! #MLBSWEEPS2020”
Perhaps things won’t be this drastic, and perhaps it’ll be closer to 2025 than 2020. But regardless, Major League Baseball has amped up its marketing throughout the past decade, especially in the past five or so years, and the results have not always been positive. Sure, there’s been a positive overall response; but loyal baseball fans loved the game long before MLB.com existed, and “giving the fans what they want” has quickly become “giving the fans what they didn’t know they wanted until it was advertised as a real option.”
It’s not just the folks in the MLB marketing department who are doing this. Recently, reporters and announcers have started to view things from the perspective of a fan, rather than a neutral party paid to portray the game in the most informative way possible.
For example, Saturday’s White Sox-Tigers game saw a tough play end Brad Penny’s no-hit bid. Chicago’s Brent Morel hit a sharp grounder down the line that Detroit third baseman Brandon Inge made a terrific effort getting to and fielding cleanly, but his long throw pulled first baseman Miguel Cabrera off the bag and Morel was safe. The Tigers’ radio announcers immediately opined that the ball was a hit — and it certainly was, given that a less-gifted third baseman wouldn’t have reached the ball to begin with. 
However, rather than confirm what would end up being the right call, Thom Brennaman and Mark Grace — announcers for FOX’s broadcast of the game — spent time offering reasons for the play to be ruled an error in order to preserve the no-hitter.
“And they ruled it a hit,” Brennaman said, sounding incredulous, upon seeing the ruling.
“Much to the chagrin of Tiger fans,” Grace agreed. “They wanted to see some history!”
Well, of course they did, but that doesn’t mean it was the wrong call. That’s why the official scorer is one of my favorite people in the ballpark. He’s the most neutral guy there can be, going strictly by the book and not by favoritism of any kind, no matter how cool a no-hitter would be. 
Maybe in 2020, Tammi wouldn’t get to choose the ballpark to rename and the team to start for — she’d just get to do it for the All-Star Game. That seems a bit more, um, realistic. In fact, All-Star balloting began on April 19 last year, so perhaps it hasn’t started yet this year because MLB.com has a big surprise up its virtual sleeve that’ll blow fans’ minds. Something crazy and super-awesome that will not only wow current fans, but bring in those new fans in droves.
What new fans?
Sure, baseball garners new fans every day, but I doubt those fans notice baseball because they can vote 25 times for the All-Star teams or because there’s a chance to throw out a first pitch at a ballgame. Maybe if that one person who wins that sweepstakes wasn’t a fan already, he or she would take a closer look at the game, but would those who didn’t win care at all? Probably not.
The integration of blogging and commenting into MLB.com has done some good to promote fans’ involvement and opinions. But while 5 to 10 percent of these comments and blogs are well-informed and well-thought-out, the other 90 to 95 percent just provide an outlet for bandwagoners and other such “fans” to let their uninformed thoughts fly into the public eye like YouTube comments.
Bad for baseball? Yes. Fans are a very important part of the game, but almost all fans have a team that they root for, and more than promotions or the public acknowledgment of their opinions, the thing that keeps them coming back is good, winning baseball. Hopefully, for the good of the game, Major League Baseball will not expand replay further than its current use for home run calls.
That said, if it does, one of commissioner Bud Selig’s reasons had better not be, “We want to make sure we are providing the best baseball experience for the fans.”

Anna Lenhart is one of the most seasoned runners on the Carnegie Mellon women’s track and field team and cross country team. She has been running mid-distance and jumping events for the Tartans since 2006. As a fifth-year and red-shirt senior, she is now one of the leaders of the squad.
Lenhart is from Hagerstown, Md., and majors in civil and environmental engineering.
Lenhart’s teams have been a huge part of her college career. “I can’t imagine what Carnegie Mellon would have been like without cross country and track,” she said. “The team is like a family.”
She has been running for the cross country team since 2006. Her most notable race was at the second annual Cedarville University Open, where she placed 16th overall in the 5k with a time of 20:20.73. This season, she completed another 5k at Washington & Lee University in 19:20.
Lenhart has also been a member of the track team since 2007, notably placing seventh overall in the pole vault at the UAA Championships in 2008.
Even with all her past accomplishments, Lenhart still boasts about this season’s track and field team. “This is the most talented track team I’ve been on at Carnegie Mellon. We are well represented in every event, and at every meet it seems like most of our team sets new personal records, which keeps it exciting,” she said.
As a respected veteran of the team, she is looked to as a leader. As a leader, she is happier with team success than with personal success. Her most memorable moment of the 2010 track and field season is from the first meet of the season, at Washington & Lee University. “It was a big meet and very early in the season, so I wasn’t sure what to expect, but it seemed that every time an announcement was made, it included one of our girls’ top performances. I think we won five events at that meet; it was fun to see,” she said.
As a senior, Lenhart will be graduating after this season. She will be missed by her teammates. Sophomore Luci Laffitte said, “She truly loves the sport of running and is very dedicated to the team. She puts her heart into every race.”

The Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team beat Brandeis University, but lost to Emory University and the University of Chicago in the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championship, earning the Tartans fourth place in the tournament.
The match for third place against Chicago, played Sunday, April 17 on the Brandeis campus in Waltham, Mass., was a tight one. The Tartans lost 5–4.
The Tartans led in doubles play with two wins and one loss. Sophomore Jooho Yu and junior Forrest Grinstead won the Tartans their first match with an 8–4 win at No. 3 doubles.
Seniors Alex Nemerov and Bobby MacTaggart put Carnegie Mellon at a 2–0 advantage by winning at No. 1 doubles with a score of 8–2.
“We were pretty excited about the way we came out of doubles,” MacTaggart said. “We looked forward to having the top billing.”
In the singles division, things were going less desirably. Although the doubles team had earned the Tartans a coveted lead, Carnegie Mellon went down 4–2 in singles play. Sophomore Duke Miller helped bring the Tartans back a bit with a 2–6, 6–1, 6–3 win at No. 2 singles. Nemerov, at the No. 1 singles position, won after a three-set match with scores of 6–4, 4–6, and 7–5. MacTaggart, junior Jeremy King, Yu, and first-year Julian Pearlman lost their singles contests.
“With our advantage in doubles,” MacTaggart said, “we were obviously pretty disappointed by the way that things turned out.”
“We played a good weekend with a lot of close matches,” first-year Mason Radford said. “Emory was a really tough team to beat, although I do think that we should have beat the University of Chicago. In the end, we played a tough fight.”
The No. 17 Tartans finished UAA Championship play with a season record of 14–10. Individual players will be competing in the NCAA regional tournament next month.

The men’s and women’s track and field team rounded out the regular season this weekend at the two-day outdoor UAA Championships, hosted by Emory University in Atlanta. The men’s team scored 107.5 points, just passing Emory’s 106 and earning Carnegie Mellon the third-place title. The women’s team came in fifth with a total score of 78 points. Washington University in St. Louis and Emory won the men’s and women’s meets, respectively.
Both Carnegie Mellon’s men’s and women’s teams saw great individual and relay performances.
On the men’s team, senior Dustin Musselman won the javelin with a throw of 52.71 meters. Musselman, along with first-year Tim Kikta, junior Ryan Kissell, and sophomore Noel Titus, also competed in the 4x100-meter relay. Their time of 44.10 seconds won third place and All-UAA status. The 4x800 team of junior Rob Morhard, senior John Briguglio, first-year Mike Standish, and senior Nate Bussiere also had a great performance, placing second with a time of 7:26.20.
Career bests were recorded by first-year Zachary Erra-Hernandez in the discus throw (44.23 meters), sophomore Daniel Cardenas Rivero in the pole vault (4.00 meters), sophomore Daniel Ching in the 400-meter hurdles (54.05 seconds), and Kikta in the 400-meter dash (49.92 seconds).
On the women’s team, first-year Jackie Guevel won both the 100- and 400-meter hurdles while setting four records. Her 14.18-second finish in the 100-meter hurdles set both school and UAA records, as did her time of 1:02.12 in the 400-meter hurdles. Guevel is first in the nation for the 100-meter hurdles and fourth for the 400-meter hurdles. 
New school records were also set by the 4x800-meter, 4x400-meter, and 4x100-meter relay teams. Sophomore Emily Wobb, senior Courtney Baker, junior Christine Warner, and senior Laura McKee won fourth in the 4x800 with a time of 9:33.20. McKee, Guevel, Baker, and junior Luci Laffitte won third place with a time of 3:48.45 in the 4x400-meter relay. A fifth-place finish was earned by the 4x100-meter relay team composed of Laffitte, junior Lisa Marion Garcia, Guevel, and senior Kim Nederlof with a time of 50.09 seconds.
Sophomore Carissa Iannone also turned in great individual performances, earning her career best in both the javelin (35.77 meters) and hammer throw (38.27 meters). Senior Melissa Hwang earned her career best in the triple jump (10.87 meters) and long jump (5.02 meters).
The team’s sportsmanship during the meet was notable. “I would like to say that while our team performance was excellent this year, I was more humbled by the support that each teammate, field or track, had for each other across the two days,” Wobb said. 
The Tartans will go on to compete at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa., May 13. All qualifying Tartans will then go on to the National Championship at Ohio Wesleyan University May 26–28.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s golf team finished its season by hosting the annual Carnegie Mellon Invitational last Thursday at the Longue Vue Club in Verona, Pa. Competing against the Tartans were Washington & Jefferson College, California University of Pennsylvania, Westminster College, and St. Vincent College. Out of the five-school field, the Tartans finished second to Washington & Jefferson by seven strokes.
The Tartans saw an outstanding performance from senior Brent Driscoll. Driscoll finished his last invite for Carnegie Mellon by shooting a 74, only four over par, to finish third overall. First-year and Pennsylvania native Ian Bangor shot eight over par (78) in his first career Carnegie Mellon Invitational to tie for 11th place with fellow Tartan junior Michael Cheng. Junior Terence Einhorn finished 13th for team by shooting a 79, while first-year Alex Fry came in 26th.
Competing individually for the Tartans, first-year Grant Strimel shot a 77, putting him in eighth place overall.
After a successful season, the Tartan golf team will resume play in the fall.

The subject of extracting natural gas from the Marcellus Shale has been a sensitive subject in southwestern Pennsylvania, as people have heavily debated the environmental impacts of the techniques used in extraction.
Just this week, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PaDEP) asked all Marcellus Shale natural gas drilling operators to stop delivering wastewater from shale gas extraction to 15 different wastewater treatment plants around the Pittsburgh region by May 19. This request was greatly influenced by recent research conducted by Carnegie Mellon researchers in the department of civil and environmental engineering.
“Drilling has gone on [in] this region for many, many years,” explained Jess Wilson, a civil and environmental engineering graduate student who has been studying the water quality of the Monongahela River for the last two years. “But it’s only because of hydraulic fracturing, which is this new method that involves the injection of all this water into the well, that we’re seeing all of this produced water come back up out of the well that is really, really high in chloride and bromide. So that’s where you have all this wastewater that needs to be disposed of somewhere.”
The Monongahela River serves as a source of drinking water to over 800,000 people in southwestern Pennsylvania; among other contaminants, Wilson has been focused mainly on bromide levels in this river’s water. Bromide itself is non-toxic, but when it reacts with chlorine that is used during treatment, it forms brominated byproducts that have been found to be carcinogenic to humans.
“I think the first obvious thing you have to do is to not put bromide in [the water] in the first place. If you have really low concentrations of bromide, the formation of brominated byproducts will be really low,” Wilson said. 
Historically, bromide levels have been reasonably low in river waters in southwest Pennsylvania, but Wilson and colleagues observed a spike in the bromide concentrations along the Monongahela River in July 2010. After normalizing for several external factors that could influence the bromide levels, such as river flow and temperature, the team of researchers says that the levels have not dropped back down since. 
“Whenever I was asked all week, ‘What’s causing all the bromide?’ I said, it’s easy — it’s our addiction to fossil fuel,” said Jeanne VanBriesen, a professor in the department of civil and environmental engineering who advises Wilson and leads Carnegie Mellon’s work in water quality research on the Monongahela River. VanBriesen explained that the increased bromide levels are a result of either wastewater from coal-fire power plants or from Marcellus Shale wastewater. However, research performed by the Pittsburgh Water and Sewage Authority indicates that wastewater from extracting shale gas may be a large contributor. 
The Marcellus Shale Coalition has acknowledged the research, and released a statement on Tuesday with regard to the situation: “Research by Carnegie Mellon University and Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority experts suggests that the natural gas industry is a contributing factor to elevated levels of bromide in the Allegheny and Beaver Rivers. We are committed to leading efforts, and working alongside DEP and other stakeholders, to address these issues quickly and straightforwardly, and support the appropriate action taken by DEP today.”
“This was an earth-shattering statement to make,” VanBriesen said in response to the coalition’s acceptance of responsibility and willingness to fix the problem of bromide contamination. As VanBriesen’s research group continues monitoring bromide levels in the region’s river water, the verdict is still out on whether or not PaDEP’s request will be accepted.

Many adults assume they can get away with five to six hours of sleep every night. With the semester coming to a close and final exams just around the corner, many students may be neglecting sleep even more than usual. But five to six hours should be enough, right? Researchers in the Sleep and Chronobiology Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania conducted a study to assess the validity of this claim.
For a period of two weeks, three groups of people were subjected to the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT), a sustained attention examination used frequently by psychophysiologists to test the effects of sleep deprivation on a person’s attentiveness. Each member of the first group of people was allocated a daily total of four hours of sleep, the second group six hours of sleep, and the control group the usual daily eight hours of sleep. 
During the PVT, which was administered several times a day over the course of the two-week study, participants were given a clicker and were told to press its button whenever a stimulus appeared on a computer screen. The test identified lapses in alertness — when a participant failed to click when the stimulus appeared, it was attributed to a lack of alertness. 
Unsurprisingly, the four-hour group saw a sharp decline in performance over the two weeks of the experiment, while the six-hour group saw a steady but significant decline. The control group was able to maintain similar levels of alertness throughout the two weeks. Members of the four- and six-hour groups who claimed that they felt “well-rested” still underwent these drastic declines in responsiveness.
Sara Mouhktar, a sophomore double major in English and psychology, claimed the chasm between the way the participants felt and their actual performance did not surprise her. “We’ve learned so much about the importance of sleep for memory consolidation,” Mouhktar said. “So maybe if we aren’t conscious of it and think we could still be fine after minimal sleep, it still affects us.” Mouhktar claimed that because she views sleep as “super-important for [her] general health,” she gets an average of seven hours of it a night.
Kelley Shell, health promotion specialist at Carnegie Mellon’s Student Health Services, supported Mouhktar’s sleep schedule. “Research has confirmed that most adults need seven to nine hours of sleep each night,” Shell explained. “Most people sleeping six hours or less each night are actually experiencing sleep deprivation. Fatigue, irritability, poor concentration, low energy levels, and distractibility are all signs of sleep deprivation.”
Unfortunately, sleep deprivation seems to be a major problem for some Carnegie Mellon students, like Parikshit Mistry, a second-year business administration major in the Tepper School of Business. “Up until [this] semester, I wasn’t that involved in activities on campus,” Mistry said. “I used to get about six hours of sleep. For me, I guess six hours of sleep is good enough.... I’ve been a near 4.0 student [until now].” 
However, because he’s recently gotten more involved in other campus happenings, Mistry has noticed a direct correlation between the amount of sleep he gets and his academic performance. “Now I barely get four hours of sleep a day,” Mistry said. “It’s definitely taken a toll on my grades and performance ... more so on my motivation, you know, because I feel tired, stressed out.... The last thing I want to do after all my classes and activities is go back to my books and stuff.”
Vincent Kiang, an ECE graduate student, is taking 75 units this — his last — semester. Kiang will be completing Carnegie Mellon’s ECE Integrated Master’s/Bachelor’s Program (typically a five-year program) in four years, and is consequently involved in multiple time-consuming research projects, lab sessions, and presentations. However, Kiang gets much more sleep than the average college student, who, according to the McKinley Health Center at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, gets an average of six hours of sleep a day.
“My brain just cannot function with just four hours of sleep,” said Kiang. “Personally, I need eight-plus hours of sleep every day. On Saturday ... I tend to get 10–11 hours of sleep.” Kiang, like most other Carnegie Mellon students, has had to stay up at times to finish homework assignments or study for an upcoming exam. 
“To some degree it helps,” he said. “I’ll try and stay up late just to make sure I cram everything in, because [otherwise] what can I do on an exam, even in my best condition. But I’ll make sure I get the most important details down [and] I’ll make sure I get a certain amount of sleep.... I’m not an all-nighter person.”
Mouhktar also seemed to echo Kiang’s views. “A lot of the time, I decide to sleep early and wake up early to finish whatever I was doing,” she said. “I guess because I’ve read a lot about the importance of sleep, I try to prioritize it more. But that’s not to say that everyone should sleep more. I know a lot of people who can pull all-nighters and do amazing on their exams. I just can’t.” 
So why are there extraordinary students, like those Mouhktar describe, who can get away with relatively little sleep and still maintain great cognitive performance? Shell gave insight into one possible reason, claiming “researchers are exploring genetics as one explanation for why sleep needs vary.” 
For other normal, sleep-deprived students, she offered some professional advice. “Take naps! If you cannot get 7–9 hours of sleep in a night, naps between 30–60 minutes can help improve alertness and productivity.”

The online retailer Amazon just released a discounted version of its best-selling, best-reviewed, and most-wanted item: the Kindle. The device is an electronic book reader that boasts a variety of advantages over normal books as well as other hand-held devices with large displays. 
The Kindle has the ability to store more books in less space than traditional paper books. Amazon also claims that the Kindle has a screen that is easier on the eyes than traditional LCD displays. These screens are the primary distinguishing factor between tablets and electronic book readers, and it is these screens that contribute to many of the benefits e-book readers offer their users. 
Recently, increasing demand has caused a large number of models of electronic book readers to flood the market, despite the argument from many that the uses of electronic book readers are much less versatile than those of tablets. 
The technology behind the screens of electronic book readers dictates both their benefits and their limitations. These screens are complex to manufacture, as they require very small and durable parts, but the basic principle behind them is fairly simple. 
According to PCWorld, each screen consists of very small micro-capsules on the order of 100 micrometers trapped between two transparent sheets of clear plastic. Inside each micro-capsule there exist many small balls colored either white or black, suspended inside a slimy liquid. These small balls carry charges and are free to move around inside the micro-capsule. 
To create pictures on the screen, an electric current is applied to the bottom sheet of plastic which forces the balls inside the micro-capsule to either be attracted to or repelled from the bottom of the micro-capsule. The balls that float to the top can be seen by the reader through the top sheet of plastic. Many of these micro-capsules combine to create readable text. 
Recently, colored versions of these displays have also been created. They work in much the same way as the black-and-white versions, except that the top sheet of plastic is not colorless anymore; it is instead colored in small pixels, each of which has a red, blue, green, and white area. The micro-capsules beneath each area are appropriately colored to give each area a specific darkness, and the mixture of shades in each pixel creates a distinct color. Hence, the light that will reflect off the top sheet of plastic will have a different color for each pixel. 
According to E-ink, the company at the forefront of developing these technologies, electronic ink has many advantages over traditional LCD displays. Electronic ink displays use much less power than LCD displays, with some e-readers only requiring a power charge once a month. 
E-readers with this technology are also more durable and flexible, so displays of electronic ink can be bent much more than LCD displays can. Also, these screens cause less glare, and so they may be more suitable during prolonged exposure than LCD displays. These displays can also last for long amounts of time — up to a month without a power-charge in some cases — and actively help reduce the use of paper, which makes them very environmentally friendly. 
Over the past few years, electronic ink has been integrated into more applications than only electronic book readers. It is being used to replace both paper and LCD screens for many applications. 
For example, Costco just began a pilot program to replace its shelf tags with E-Ink displays to reduce the consumption of paper due to those tags. Electronic ink displays have also been integrated into jewelery that can now change its design, such as bracelets that double as watches. Bendable clocks and changing keyboards are other technologies that use electronic ink. Finally, SmartDisplayer has begun creating credit cards with electronic ink displays that do not display the card numbers unless the user of the card types in a PIN number; this technology may reduce the cost of losing one’s credit card. 
While e-readers might have introduced electronic ink technology to the world on a large scale, innovations will undoubtedly mean that we will keep finding new uses for this technology.

Study suggests southern Africa as language source
In an article recently published in Science, a biologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand has concluded that human language originated in southern Africa. Quentin Atkinson, the author of the study, used a mathematical model to trace common linguistic features back through time, much in the same way scientists trace the evolutionary history of organisms. While the oldest language tree that has been constructed so far — the Indo-European family — goes back 9,000 years, it is predicted that language itself originated between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago.

Chimpanzees sacrifice initiative for conformity
Researchers at Georgia State University determined that in a social environment, chimpanzees would follow a dominant leader even when it meant receiving a worse outcome. In a situation with one dominant female and four subordinate chimpanzees, the subordinates mimicked the female’s actions. This occurred even though the other chimps had been trained to work towards a better reward. The lead researcher, Lydia Hopper, has theorized that the value of maintaining social alliances may outweigh the immediate value of a better reward.

Postpartum depression more likely in fall, winter
A study by researchers at Uppsala University in Sweden suggests that women who give birth between October and December may be twice as likely to develop postpartum depression than new mothers in the rest of the year. The study, which was published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, involved over 2,000 Swedish women. Because of Sweden’s high latitude and high variation in sunlight between summer and winter, the authors believe these seasonal effects may be less pronounced in other regions.

New spending bill limits U.S.-China collaboration
A provision in the recently passed 2011 spending bill bans any collaboration between the United States and China on scientific work coordinated by NASA or the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. The measure’s sponsor, Frank Wolf (R–Va.), aims to restrict any joint projects between specific U.S. government agencies and any body of the Chinese government. Previous collaborations have covered “fisheries, earth and atmospheric sciences, basic research, ... and disaster relief” among other areas.

Biologists study disease-resistant mosquitoes
Andrea Crisanti and Austin Burt, molecular biologists at Imperial College London, are developing techniques to spread disease-resistant mosquitoes in the wild. Scientists have been working for some time to manipulate mosquitoes’ genetic code to avoid the transmission of diseases like malaria. Crisanti and Burt’s approach used a homing-endonuclease gene (HEG) to spread a genetic modification among a population of mosquitoes. HEG is a so-called “selfish” gene, which spreads rapidly through a population.

Intelligent systems developed to monitor newborns
InfoSphere Streams, a system developed by IBM, is being used in hospitals to process data about newborns in the intensive care unit. In the past, an enormous amount of data was collected about infant patients, but most of this data was discarded. InfoSphere Streams processes all this data in real-time to better predict if an infant has an infection or some other problem. The system was first implemented in the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto and is spreading to other facilities around the world.

Although the fickle weather of the last couple of weeks might suggest otherwise, summer is, in fact, only a few weeks away. Most students will probably pack up all of their belongings and either put them in storage or bring them home, only to bring everything back a few months later. If you don’t have plans back in your hometown yet, consider staying in Pittsburgh for the summer.
Many students leave Pittsburgh during the summer simply because they do not have a place to live; if students reside on campus, they must vacate their dorm buildings during the summer. However, there are multiple options for summer housing for students.
Carnegie Mellon students are eligible for summer housing through Housing and Dining Services. Students can apply for single or double rooms in Donner House or for off-campus apartments in Fairfax Apartments or Webster Hall. Obtaining summer housing through Carnegie Mellon serves as a convenient option for many. “It was easy to find and it was close to where I was working, and the furniture was already provided,” said Lianne Cohen, a junior biological sciences major who lived in Fairfax Apartments while doing research in Mellon Institute last summer. “It was a nice apartment with a good location, and it had air conditioning, which was a big plus in Pittsburgh over the summer.”
Although summer housing through the university is convenient, there are some downsides. “It was more expensive than if I had looked for a sublet,” Cohen said. “Moving into the apartment was also difficult. I lived in Morewood during the year, but I went home for two and a half weeks, so I put stuff into CMU storage. I had to contact the housefellow and make separate arrangements to get my stuff out, which was inconvenient.” Students can apply for housing through the Summer Housing 2011 application available on the Housing and Dining website. Applications should be submitted to the Housing and Dining Office in Morewood Gardens by Friday, May 6.
Another on-campus alternative is Greek housing: Many fraternities and sororities offer sublets over the summer. This option is often a cheaper alternative than campus housing, with the rent averaging about $100 per month. “I lived here last summer in [Alpha Chi Omega],” said Emily Forney, a junior philosophy major who worked for the university last summer. “I know that it was super cheap for sisters and non-Greek women to live in the house and a great social experience.” Students who wish to live in Greek housing can visit a chapter’s website and e-mail the house manager about room availability.
Students can also sublet off-campus apartments. “It tends to be easy to find sublets in Pittsburgh. Most of the people you know who live off-campus are looking for students to rent their rooms during the summer,” said Ellen Obenshain, a sophomore civil and environmental engineering major who worked at the university last summer. “I got my room on Wilkins from a friend of a friend of a friend just by asking around.”
There are also several websites that serve as resources for students staying in Pittsburgh over the summer. One useful website is Padmapper.com; this Web application aggregates apartment listings from Craigslist, Apartments.com, and other sources, and compiles them into Google Maps. Users can then filter the listings by specifications such as price, location, and number of bedrooms. “I used Padmapper to find my apartment for this summer. It was a total lifesaver,” said Jessica Virdo, a junior computer science major who is working and taking classes at the university this summer.
Another newer method of searching for housing is through miscmarket.org, a website developed by Carnegie Mellon students for students. As Alex Price, a sophomore business major who worked with the team that developed miscmarket.org, explained, “Miscmarket is like an organized Craigslist for college students. [It’s] super safe and super easy.” In order to join the website, users must register with their Andrew e-mail addresses; the website has a section dedicated to housing that includes listings for summer sublets.
Once you have gained housing for the summer, you can start planning what you can do while in Pittsburgh. The city is full of fun events and activities during the summer — art festivals, food festivals, and film festivals abound, along with other fun activities.
Kicking off the string of summer festivals in Pittsburgh is the Silk Screen Asian American Film Festival, which takes place May 6–15. The festival, which first began in 2006, will show 26 different films in the Regent Square Theater in Regent Square, Harris Theater downtown, and the Melwood Screening Room in Oakland. The festival will begin with an Opening Night Gala in the William Penn Hotel, featuring a variety of dance and musical performances and Asian food. The opening night film, which will be shown at Harris Theater, is [ITAL]I Am[ITAL], a movie about modern Indian society; tickets for the movie are $15 in advance. As the organization’s website explained, “Silk Screen hopes to become one the best festivals of its kind in the world, putting Pittsburgh on the world cultural map for Asian culture, particularly Asian films.”
From June 3 to 12, the 52nd annual Three Rivers Art Festival will take place in downtown Pittsburgh. The self-described “region’s largest multidisciplinary showcase of visual art and performing arts” has cumulatively featured over 10,000 visual and performing artists over the years. Lauren Milisits, a sophomore studying mechanical engineering and computer science, attended the festival last year and commended it, saying, “There were a lot of vendors. It was something different.”
Cohen, who also attended the festival, said, “[It was] nice to see all the booths because there’s a lot of different types of art. It’s really different from other things in Pittsburgh.” Last year’s festival included music performances, art workshops and exhibits, an indie craft market, free yoga lessons, and poetry readings. The musicians booked so far for this year’s festival include Brandi Carlile, 14-time Grammy Award winner Ricky Skaggs, and Pittsburgh’s own Formula412.
To celebrate Independence Day, attend the Pittsburgh Three Rivers Regatta, a three-day event from July 2 to 4, that includes a sand sculpture contests, a boat race, a “Circus Spectacle,” and a grand fireworks display on the Fourth of July. “The fireworks were really nice,” Cohen said. “We got there early and got great seats, so it was really cool. There were so many people in Point [State] Park that it was hard getting out and finding buses. But they had fair foods and stuff on both sides of the river, and it was really fun.”
Aside from the festivals, there are also many events that occur regularly throughout the summer. The Dollar Bank Cinema in the Park presents free movie screenings in parks throughout Pittsburgh, with showings on Flagstaff Hill on both Wednesdays and Sundays at dusk. The movie showings are “nice because they played a lot of popular movies,” Cohen said. “You bring your own blanket and it’s a fun thing to do.”
Another regular event is the Mellon Square Summer Concert Series; go downtown around lunchtime on Thursdays and listen to local bands entertain the city at Mellon Square.
Even if you don’t feel like going far from campus, there are still plenty of ways to stay entertained that are conveniently located. Virdo worked and took classes in Pittsburgh last summer, and said, “I took day trips to the museums and stuff with my friends. Carnegie Mellon has a lot of events during the summer too. Some student organizations still meet during the summer, like KGB. They had meetings once a week and had events on campus on Fridays and Saturdays.” 
She continued, “There were interesting talks from visiting scholars and lecturers, and grad student defenses and stuff over the summer. You just have to look for anything that is relevant to your field — most of the standard stuff is still going on.”
Although Carnegie Mellon students spend plenty of time in Pittsburgh during the winter, they should also consider spending their summer here — they might be surprised by all this city has to offer.
Editor's Note: This article was modified on 4/25/11 to clarify ticket prices for the Silk Screen Asian American Film Festival. The article originally stated that tickets for the event were $15; in fact, only tickets to the opening night film are $15.

Teenage realistic fiction has, in recent years, become a wasteland of clichéd and hackneyed plotlines. Open up any novel that tries to tackle the life of the American teenager and brace yourself for an onslaught of superficial romance, an annoyingly large amount of angst, and a noticeable lack of academics. Any novel that manages to avoid these clichés and provide an innovative look into the teenage psyche is a breath of fresh air. Will Grayson, Will Grayson, written by The New York Times-bestselling authors John Green and David Levithan, possesses a glimpse of that innovative spark.
At the book’s core, it is a story about love and friendship — and the intersection of the two — told from the perspective of two teenage narrators, both of whom are named Will Grayson. While this could have resulted in just another run-of-the-mill teen book, the genuineness of the narrators, along with the quirky plot, results in a non-trivializing yet still massively entertaining look at teenage life in America.
Will Grayson, Will Grayson is comprised of two different plots, one of which is written by Green and the other by Levithan. Levithan’s Will Grayson is a clinically depressed social pariah whose only source of joy is an online boyfriend named Issac. Green’s Will Grayson isn’t much better off; he is terminally apathetic, especially regarding relationships, while his best friend, Tiny Cooper, drags Will into joining the Gay Straight Alliance and assisting him with a production of Tiny Dancer, a musical documenting Tiny’s life.
For the first part of the novel there is no overlap between the two stories at all, and even after the two stories do overlap, it is only a brief intersection. Despite this, the story still feels like a unified whole. Characters that appear in both storylines are fleshed out from both perspectives and the overarching themes of both plots complement each other superbly.
What sets Will Grayson, Will Grayson apart from other teen realism books is the narrative style. Green and Levithan both construct narrators who act like believably real teenagers. They emote angst and self-pity, but they aren’t overt expressions; rather, they’re hidden in the conversations between the characters. Both narrators are capable of feeling a wide spectrum of emotions and respond realistically to different situations; there is no over-the-top drama. The ideas that both Will Graysons express in their narratives may be stereotypical teenage emotions, but they are conveyed maturely and convincingly.
While some teen realism books need to find some new angle from which to examine the mind of the American teenager in order to stand out, Will Grayson, Will Grayson takes the ordinary and expected and elevates it to a new level.

Between Abduction being filmed here last summer and The Dark Knight Rises coming to film this summer, it’s easy to see: Pittsburgh is becoming a movie city. Some bloggers have even started referring to Pittsburgh as the Hollywood of the East. One company, the Steeltown Entertainment Project, is doing what it can to encourage this growing cinematic reputation through its Steeltown Film Factory competition.
The Steeltown Film Factory competition is a yearlong filmmaking competition where contestants submit short screenplays, which must somehow be connected to western Pennsylvania, to a panel of judges with the hopes of winning $30,000 to make their movie. This year’s competition has multiple ties to Pittsburgh: Not only are the three best scripts going to be read by Carnegie Mellon drama students at the competition’s final event on April 30, but two of the finalists have ties to Carnegie Mellon. One, Christopher Dimond, received an MFA in dramatic writing from Carnegie Mellon in 2007; the other, Yulin Kuang, is currently a junior studying social and decision sciences and English.
The Steeltown Entertainment Project was started by Carl Kurlander, a Pittsburgh native who wrote St. Elmo’s Fire and worked on Saved By the Bell. “[Kurlander] sort of realized that Pittsburgh had a lot to offer the industry,” said Jonny Paterson, a master’s student studying creative enterprise at Heinz College and an intern at Steeltown Entertainment Project. “There’s a lot of people in the diaspora of Pittsburgh who are very successful out in Hollywood and in the entertainment industry, but there’s nothing really going on Pittsburgh that’s making the most of all the talent that’s being nurtured here and that’s leaving. So Steeltown’s mission is to bring the entertainment industry back to Pittsburgh.”
The Film Factory competition works to fulfill this mission by “finding the talent that’s here in Pittsburgh and [giving] them an opportunity to have access to mentors from Hollywood and have access to funds to go away and actually make their film,” Paterson said. The competition received over 130 submissions that were then sent out to 60 different judges, almost all of whom work in the entertainment industry and have ties to Pittsburgh.
The screenplays were eventually narrowed down to a top six, which the authors then pitched to a panel of producers, including John Dellaverson (producer, Lionsgate) and Bernie Goldmann (producer, 300). They gave each author feedback in front of an audience. Despite the pressure of presenting her work onstage, “[Kuang] was the most composed of the lot, and I don’t know if that comes from being from Carnegie Mellon or comes from her being great at what she does, but she was standing up there in front of these three guys who are insanely successful out in Hollywood, and she really pitched [her story] well,” Paterson said. After that event, the six finalists were narrowed down to a top three.
Kuang, who also wrote Zombie College Musical, is by far the youngest of the three finalists. Both Dimond and Philip Beard, the third finalist, have already published musicals and novels, respectively. “She’s done really well to get to where she is,” Paterson said.
One of the advantages of the event was the feedback that the finalists received from the judges. As the authors advanced through each round of the competition, they received comments and criticisms from the judges, and were then allowed to rewrite their scripts.
At “Script to Stage: The Final Pitch,” the final event of the competition, Carnegie Mellon drama students will perform a staged reading for a panel of judges, including Kim Moses (executive producer of Ghost Whisperer) and Bob Kusbit (executive producer of MTV’s Made); after the readings, a winner will be chosen. “[Kuang’s] got every chance to win,” Paterson said.
“Script to Stage: The Final Pitch” will take place April 30 in the Helen Wayne Rauh Studio Theatre. Tickets are available online at www.steeltownfilmfactory.org.

Every year at Carnival, students eagerly gather to watch Buggy pushers race to the finish line in competition for first place. Last Monday, though, a different sort of race took place — one where “buggies” thrust, bounced, and rollerbladed their way to the finish line, and everyone received a prize. Outside Doherty Hall, the second annual Anti-Gravity Downhill Derby took place, providing a quirky and colorful antithesis to the traditional buggy Sweepstakes.
After several musicians from the Pipe Band provided a musical introduction to the event, visiting professor and host Pat Olezsko — a performance artist known for her use of elaborate costumes and props — welcomed everyone to the event. Her speech immediately let the audience know that this was not a typical race; “I don’t have to tell you, but [this event is] all about acting.” She then introduced the first “buggy,” which was more like a parade float than a buggy. The float featured a lifeguard stand with two decidedly-uncaring lifeguards on top, and an “ocean” made of blue plastic bags.
This was, however, only a small taste of the ridiculousness to follow. One of the subsequent entries in the derby was the Hot Rod Bod, for which a woman in a shiny red bodysuit crouched down in a cart with wheels. With a license plate reading “Jail B8” stuck onto her bottom, she began to thrust forward to make the cart move as Olezsko commented, “She’s humping her way all the way to the finish line!” Although she occasionally needed someone to come and push her, she did indeed thrust all the way to the finish line.
The next entry was the Omega Omega sisters, or the “OMG OMGs,” as they called themselves. Three girls dressed in tiny black sweatpants, pink Ugg boots, and long, blond wigs pranced their way down the track on a fake pink treadmill that had wheels on the bottom. In one of the funniest acts of the event, two bikinied women and one shirtless man pushed a woman dressed as a pimp in a baby carriage. The “pimp” obnoxiously ordered the women to fan him with palm branches as “he” shoved fake dollar bills into their bikinis, then threw spare bills at the audience standing on the sidelines.
Once they reached a finish line, a girl in a long ball gown came running out to the start of the race, exclaiming that she had to get to the ball, but didn’t have any way of getting there. After singing for her animal friends to help in a manner reminiscent of Giselle in Enchanted, the princess delightedly ascended a bouncing horse on wheels with the help of derby assistants. She then merrily bounced her horse down to the finish line, waving like true royalty to the audience as she passed.
In perhaps the oddest act of the evening, several graduate art students dressed as Peeps flailed about in a baby pool full of soapy water and threw wet, soapy Peeps at the audience. Their float, which had spilled over before the derby began, fell apart before the group could reach the finish line.
Out of all 17 acts that participated, the most interesting — and sensical — was the final act, wherein Olezsko donned a goofy, overly-patriotic outfit, climbed aboard a float made of oil drums, and chugged out of a bottle labeled “Crude Oil,” spewing out the oil onto members of the audience as the float drove past them.
After handing out quirkily-titled awards — the first float, for example, received the “Smoke on the Water Award” — and having the the Pipe Band members play one last closing number, the Anti-Gravity Downhill Derby came to an end. Hopefully, however, it will be back again next year, as a colorful and quirky “alternative to the ever-exciting Buggy races,” as Olezsko herself drily said.

Jamie Woon is a rising British rhythm and blues singer and songwriter. His first release was Wayfaring Stranger EP in 2007, but the budding artist only received significant acclaim after the release of the single “Night Air” in 2010. Woon released his debut studio album Mirrorwriting on April 18. This album includes both slow melodies and strong rhythms. The hypnotic tunes and the soft, smooth voice of Woon together revive key elements of ’90s old-school R&B.
The song “Night Air” in particular has an alluring beat and a calm, flowing melody sung by Woon. The melody sounds like a soothing lullaby, and Woon’s vocals are certainly soft enough to make the listener enter a state of relaxation — yet the steady rhythm pounding softly in the background is upbeat and has a very danceable quality.
“Lady Luck” is reminiscent of the ’90s and has a very catchy and upbeat rhythm. Woon’s sultry vocals have a jazzy appeal in this song, while the mesmerizing background music maintains a captivating rhythm.
A song that illustrates Woon’s talents very well is “Spirits.” This beautiful a cappella weaving of harmonies also showcases Woon’s ability to beatbox. The song begins with a single layer of beatboxing, and more and more vocal layers of harmony are added. Once the intricacies of the song completely materialize, the song sounds like a spiritual, as the title suggests.
“Spiral” is a very calm and soulful song that truly embodies the blues element of R&B. The sensual vocals are spaced out over a slowly streaming accompaniment of the guitar and other instruments. This is yet another song on the album that exemplifies the meaning of tranquility.
“TMRW” has an upbeat, hip-hop style. This is one of several songs on the album that seem to urge the listener to dance. The powerful throbbing rhythm, together with Woon’s vocals, creates a bold, spellbinding charm. This is one song on the album that seems to emit a strong attitude and personality.
Woon’s music is a breath of fresh air for anyone who appreciates both new- and old-school rhythm and blues. In a day when modern R&B is so much different from the older style, Woon is bringing back the soulful essence that R&B currently lacks. Woon certainly does incorporate the rhythm and the blues in his music while also sustaining a modern appeal. This album beautifully demonstrates Woon’s remarkable talent and distinctive style.

If you love scary movie marathons, then Scream 4 is a must-watch. Add some clichés — two blonde girls, a sharp knife, a telephone call, and a hoarse voice — and you’re good to go. But if you want a completely new storyline with unexpected twists and new faces, then you may want to pass on this movie.
Scream 4 was directed by Wes Craven, known for his movie A Nightmare on Elm Street. It was released to American theaters on April 15. The script was written by Kevin Williamson, who also wrote the scripts for Scream and Scream 2. Craven and Williamson managed to retain the essence of the original Scream movie by not only getting back some of the original cast members — namely Neve Campbell, David Arquette, and Courtney Cox — but also keeping the original plot intact.
The original Scream movie revolves around Sidney Prescott (portrayed by Neve Campbell), a Woodsboro teenager who receives a threatening call from a serial killer, infamously known as Ghostface. This killer follows a plan, which always begins with murdering a couple of college students alone at home, then calling up the next victim, attacking his victim’s friends at a party, and finally going after the victim. The fourth installment in the Scream series sees the return of Sidney Prescott, 10 years after the murders. Prescott, now an accomplished author, comes back to Woodsboro to promote her new book, only to realize that Ghostface has struck again. The pending police investigation carried out by Sheriff Dewey (David Arquette) makes it impossible for her to leave town. Meanwhile, Dewey’s wife Gale Weathers-Riley (Courtney Cox) gets behind the camera, and teams up with both Sidney and her real-life — as well as reel-life — husband to solve the murders, just as in the previous Scream movies.
What makes Scream 4 slightly different from the three previous Scream versions is the introduction of a lot of new characters. The new Ghostface makes Jill (played by Emma Roberts), who happens to be Prescott’s cousin, his next victim. What follows are a lot of brutal deaths, some carried out in Ghostface’s original style (getting crushed under a garage door) and others in novel ways (stabbed through the flap in the front door). By the middle of the movie, you’ll wonder if anyone will survive in the end, and who the possible killer could be. However, the reveal of the killer’s identity is probably the most surprising moment in the film.
All in all, even though Scream 4 cannot match up to the thrill provided by the original Scream movie, it will still be a must-view for horror movie fanatics. With finals week coming up, this movie would be the perfect watch to keep everyone wide awake.

I was first taken to a different country when I was two weeks old. In the years that followed, I called Naples, London, Los Angeles, and Seoul home, in addition to exploring over 30 countries. As a result, I grew up subject to the adjustments of many cultures and was a student of many schools and academic systems. It wasn’t until 2001 that my life of incessant displacement came to a comparative rest. However, after studying in one school district for over eight years, I felt nostalgic and wished to travel again.
In the summer of 2008, having few plans for time off after my sophomore year of high school, I looked into programs abroad and stumbled across the opportunity to study at Jesus College at the University of Cambridge. Given the abundance of course offerings and a setting in one of the most prestigious academic environments in the world, I submitted my essays and curriculum vitae without hesitation. Two months later I received a letter stating that I had been accepted to the 10-week program in both of my preferred major and minor courses — Architecture and Parliamentary Speech and Debate, respectively.
When I arrived, the magnificence of the grounds was immediately apparent despite the truly torrential rain. 15th-century medieval sacred architecture, which was imbued with a rich history of influential intellectual prosperity and of chronology, filled me with humility and deference; the very notion of standing where great men had once stood was both surreal and a tremendous honor. This sensation of awe and privilege dispelled my desire for a relaxing season. In fact, I felt a serious duty to challenge myself both intellectually and morally — for whatever strange and cosmic reason. Indeed, with significant exertion, the summer proved rewarding.
Each day, I spent time in a voluminous exhibition space, discussing aspects of the historic town’s architecture and specific construction elements for hours on end. Considering my major, much of my time was spent discussing conceptual readings in urban development such as Moore’s Utopia, or venturing out into Cambridge to sketch the local Cistercian architecture. The second half of the program was spent working late hours on completing floor plans, and later a scale model of my own ideal studio apartment.
Sleepless nights — similar to those had by architecture majors at Carnegie Mellon — were frequent. This made constructing on-the-fly rebuttals in Speech and Debate rather difficult. That this style of debate was altogether more exciting than the vapid sort common during secondary school, with written speeches and preemptive defenses, meant I was eager to jump onto the platform. At times when I felt incapable, however, my friends helped in their spare time. We struck up arguments during the night on our way to The Trailer of Life — the hamburger truck parked downtown — which had fantastic bacon cheeseburgers at 2 a.m.
Apart from coursework, the university held lectures by venerated figures, organized tours and expeditions to such storied places as Canterbury, and generally fostered a proactive attitude in its students. What really ensured the greatness of the experience, though, was being among people who were also forming new relationships, exploring the avenues of Cambridge, acclimating themselves to refreshing freedom and mobility, and looking to try things they hadn’t tried before.
In short, the program attracted go-getters, and the setting inspired them. Jesus College played host to 200 students; it was exploratory and innovative; we shared interests and melded our cultures and activities.
For me, the program came to a crest when I stood before my apartment model, presenting the inspiration for my design and drawing upon lessons learned of controlled breathing and metered speech as I presented to a panel of architects. I communicated the lessons I had learned not more than a day earlier in the trial room to an audience of more than 200, including my deans and colleagues. I felt accomplished and exhausted. Over two months had passed, and in the end, looking back, I had done everything I had hoped to and a great deal more.
It would be ridiculous to discount the opportunity of traveling and studying abroad; ridiculous to underestimate what there is to learn, to experience, to explore, and to appreciate.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
My roommates and I like to go out on weekends, and their friends like to tag along. However, their friends always get drunk, pass out on our couch, and throw up everywhere. I’m getting sick of it. What should I do?
Thanks,
Puke Is Everywhere
Dear PIE,
This may be a dumb question, but if they keep throwing up on your floor and couch, why do you keep putting them on your floor and couch? Put them to bed in your bathtub, but make sure to check in so they don’t choke on their own vomit. If they managed to miss the tub, the toilet, and the sink, when morning comes, throw a mop in there and lock them in. Don’t let them out until that room is spotless. Your roommates may think you’re being a jerk, but they asked for it.
As fulfilling as it may be to kick the drunken fools out of your house, if they’re in really bad shape, you can’t leave them alone. Instead, try being a killjoy. At the party, say, “Hey, you know, five shots and two bottles of 4Loko may not be such a good idea.” Sometime when everyone’s sober, tell your roommates your concerns so you can all talk to their friends together. If all else fails, replace your carpet with a tarp and cover your furniture with plastic.
Or cover their faces in Sharpie,
Brian Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I’m moving off campus next year. It’ll be my first real apartment. Do you have any tips for getting by? What are some essentials?
Thanks,
Moving Off Campus
Dear MOC,
Your first apartment; the next step into adulthood. You’ll be paying rent, buying groceries, complaining to your landlord, and dealing with the guy across the hall who slides through your front door to eat your food. An apartment is a big responsibility. But remember — you’re still a college student. It’s your duty to get the cheapest furniture you can find. Craigslist is your friend. If you’re too classy for Craigslist, check out Ikea. Just don’t take the bus, and watch out for that $80 delivery fee.
Once you have your apartment furnished (as cheaply as possible), you need to deal with your roommates. If you don’t have any, enjoy never seeing anyone for the next year. An apartment presents a whole host of new roommate issues. Does everyone buy their own groceries or share? Who cleans what and when? If their significant others are always over, do they have to pay for any food or rent? Answers: Share the big stuff, make a chore list, and yes. Problem solved.
Watch out for rats,
Patrick Hoskins

You’re at the show, watching them play. You don’t know who they are, but you envy them and their warm-hearted bohemian lifestyle on the road. You listen for a little and you now conclusively know that the coolest kids rhyme on time; they mellow to the flow and they slow with the rhythm. They’re the fortunate few that have the kindness to release what you give them.
Unfortunately for those hepcats, the assurance of the reverb sits far too tight on their jeans. As they strut their stuff from skate-punk to lo-fi ballads, it’s important to remember that garage rock as a modern ethos is as alive as God and the impassioned bearers of his cross.
In the predawn yawn of Pittsburgh, there’s a shattering of rock-and-roll lovers circling outside as the band loads their gear. After the show, there’s the ritual cigarettes and mulling about, but not much more — just an intricate game of others watching you, watching them, watching you. There’s something to that. It’s not clear what it is, but as your narrator, I’m certain there’s some beautifully orchestrated reason why you do it, right?
The moment you put on that 1997 acid jazz explosion that catapulted melody into the nearby garbage receptacles, you expected nirvana. Instead, all you got was a ride on a sawtooth wave that thrust you ever deeper into the nihilism of the your rejected Catholicism. So, reader, be you asleep or dreaming, I promise that the cool satin lick of time will bring you comfort. See, you had always thought that you’d be released by a cacophony of righteous rebels and Earth-loving anarcho-punks, but here you are, in the poorly formed cradle of loam and hand-held devices that you yourself dug.
You wait a year, I tell you. You’ll find a special someone who makes wishes when she enters new churches for the first time, and she’ll help you realize that all you need to get by is the steady hum of a poorly tuned radio.

100 YEARS AGO -- April 26, 1911
Andrew Carnegie himself is to be greeted in Pittsburgh this week with a reception in his honor. In its proposed program for the event, The Tartan indicates that the “Locomotive Spelling Cheer” will be given at 8:30 p.m., followed by the student audience singing at 8:35 p.m. That train of thought may be missing its caboose.
50 YEARS AGO -- April 26, 1961
The Tartan’s editorial board chastises those students who ignore the events of Carnival to focus purely on academic affairs. Instead of studying throughout the weekend, the board urges students to take advantage of this unique social event.
25 YEARS AGO -- April 22, 1986
A Student Senate investigation analyzes the dangers of intersections near campus. Five incidents of cars hitting pedestrians were reported in the 1985 calendar year. The article notes that the campus master plan calls for a skyway crosswalk over Forbes Avenue at Morewood Avenue.
10 YEARS AGO -- April 23, 2001
A Forum writer complains about the lack of high-speed Internet access in the Pittsburgh region. The crowds of Pittsburghers trying to convince Google to start its high-speed fiber project here don’t know how good they have it.
FIVE YEARS AGO -- May 1, 2006
The ‘O’ announces the closure of its University Center location. At the same time, Hunt Library and Dining Services announce the fall opening of the library’s Maggie Murph Café. Late-night baskets of ‘O’ fries swapped for late-night coffee breaks in the library? Well, at least the students back then didn’t have flashing library lights to deal with.
ONE YEAR AGO -- April 26, 2010
Senior thrower James Hulley is named a National Strength and Conditioning Association Athlete of the Year. The article announcing the recognition states that Hulley is looking forward to a break from “eight years of intense bouts of exercise.” That makes it sound sort of like a chronic disease.

President Obama speaks in the National Robotics Engineering Center.
President Barack Obama spoke last Friday morning at Carnegie Mellon’s National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC), located in Pittsburgh’s Lawrenceville neighborhood.
Obama addressed an excited crowd of about 150 invite-only guests, the majority of whom were chosen by the White House in addition to a select list chosen by Carnegie Mellon. The invitees included students, faculty, university leadership, alumni, and corporate partners. Obama announced a new initiative called the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP), a national effort to unite industry, universities, and the federal government to invest in innovation and technology with the purpose of creating high-tech manufacturing jobs and becoming a more globally competitive nation. According to White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, the president’s plan is slated to invest at least $500 million in existing programs and proposals.
Obama introduced his new proposal at a time when national unemployment rates are at 9.1 percent. “If we want a robust, growing economy, we need a robust, growing manufacturing sector,” Obama said. “And that’s why we’re here. Carnegie Mellon is a great example of what it means to move forward ... innovations led by your professors and your students have created more than 300 companies and 9,000 jobs over the past 15 years....”
Bruce Brown, CEO of Proctor and Gamble, attended the president’s address. Brown cited research institutions like Carnegie Mellon as “part of the United States’ competitive advantage.” He agreed with Obama on the importance of advanced manufacturing. “I think advanced manufacturing is really important to a vibrant U.S. economy. It’s also very important to innovation, because we know at P&G that breakthrough consumer innovation relies on advanced manufacturing to produce large quantities of consumer-preferred products, consistently and reliably at low costs,” Brown said.
Obama’s visit to Carnegie Mellon was announced Friday, June 17 by the White House, leaving university affiliates one week to prepare for his visit. It was his third visit to Carnegie Mellon since 2008 and his second as president.
“It seems like every time I’m here, I learn something. So for those of you who are thinking about Carnegie Mellon, it’s a terrific place, and you guys are doing just great work,” Obama said.
Before his televised address, the president toured the NREC facilities with CIT Dean Pradeep Khosla, where he saw demonstrations of Carnegie Mellon’s own cutting-edge engineering and robotics, as well as technology produced by RedZone Robotics, Proctor and Gamble, and the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency.
Khosla later remarked that he was impressed with the quality of the president’s questions during the tour. According to Khosla, Obama asked specifics about the uses of the technology, job creation potential, and its impact on people’s lives. Regarding the launching of the AMP, Khosla said, “I think that this public/private partnership is the right model of doing business. I think it brings the best from both sides, and that it allows us to work toward a common goal and make progress.”
William “Red” Whittaker, founder and director of Carnegie Mellon’s Field Robotics Center, was pleased with the presidential visit. “Robotics is a growing and going game, and it is really changing the way we live and work. It’s very fulfilling and very satisfying to see today.”
Carnegie Mellon is one of five universities involved with the AMP, along with MIT, University of Michigan, UC Berkeley, and Georgia Tech. Other AMP members include chief executive officers from manufacturing corporations such as The Dow Chemical Co., Johnson & Johnson, Stryker Corp., and Honeywell.
The full text of President Obama's remarks is available on the White House website.

The Fence was subject to vandalism Wednesday night, June 22, for the second time in a year, as layers of paint were shaved off several areas. Approximately 20 students gathered at midnight Thursday night to cover up the damage by repainting the Fence.
In addition to damaging the Fence, the vandal or vandals also wrote a message on one of its posts that said, "Hey CMYou you are a babe! NOT... Just kidding or am I? Now get back to studying...weirdos..."
The last time the Fence was intentionally damaged was March 21, when a group of students cut into it with a hacksaw. According to their open letter, those students acted out of curiosity and had no malicious intent.
Clare Graziano, a senior drama major and an Andrew Ambassador, or tour guide, for the university, explained that she and the other ambassadors first noticed the damage Thursday morning. With university officials' permission, Graziano helped organize another repainting of the Fence. "We wanted to make sure the Fence was ready as a positive message for the pre-college students when they arrive on Saturday," she said.
Gina Casalegno, the dean of Student Affairs, said in an e-mail, "The actions taken by students thus far to repair and repaint the structure are ones I applaud. One of the hallmarks of the Fence tradition is the way in which it is grass-roots organized and implemented, and to have students engaged in the response to such an incident is well-placed and appropriate. As such, any discussion of possible steps to take from here would be ones I would like to engage and involve student leadership in considering, which I intend to do as more hopefully emerges from the investigation."
Will Weiner, a junior social and decision sciences and statistics double major who is a Student Senator, reinforced this emphasis on student leadership. "Something student government is going to look into is to see if we can use some sort of security camera around here or some sort of security feature, so that's going to be one of the higher priorities when school gets into session, if not this summer," he said. "[It's] something we want to look into to see if there's a way we can get some sort of protection because ultimately that's part of our job, to protect our campus."
Despite the circumstances, the overall attitude of the evening was positive. Weiner said, "I said this last time, and I'll say it again: It's awesome to see so many people are coming out in support of [the Fence repainting]— in such short notice, in the summer, with finals tomorrow — from all different divisions of the school."

Who has bought shoes online that turned out to be the wrong fit? About one in every three customers, according to field surveys. Returns of the ill-fitting shoes create customer frustration, spew additional carbon dioxide (approximately 8,500 tons) into the atmosphere, and cost retailers more than $600 million in 2008 alone.
Enter Shoefitr, an online shoe-fitting startup created by three Carnegie Mellon alumni: Nick End, CIT’06; Breck Fresen, SCS’09; and Matt Wilkinson, CIT’06.
In January 2010, they created Shoefitr as an application that shows how a shoe will fit by using 3-D scanning technology to compare the internal dimensions of various shoes and their respective sizes. In October 2010, the company won the AlphaLab Global Pitch Competition, beating out companies based in London, Paris, Madrid, as well as major American cities.
The Shoefitr story begins with Wilkinson, who worked for 3-D Digital Corp just outside of New York City, developing 3-D scanning software to design custom orthotics and shoes. 
“I wanted to bring this technology to the masses in a retail environment,” he said. He started his own company, Best Fitting Solutions, with the intention of using his 3-D software to scan people’s feet to match with scans of shoes and then create a profile online. When the business failed, Wilkinson realized a superior alternative was to scan shoes and give sizing recommendations based on the customer’s current knowledge of their own footwear. He pitched the idea to End, a former classmate.
End had reservations, but felt the rewards of the startup were too enticing to ignore.
“Shoefitr gave me excitement and engagement that I never got at my old job,” End said. “Much of my work consisted of filling out forms.... I wasn’t content to work the same job until I retired, and wanted to try something risky while I was young and free of obligations. I figured that even if Shoefitr failed, I was young enough and smart enough to get another job like the one I had or something better.”
Wilkinson and End developed the idea while continuing to work their full-time jobs. By the end of 2008, they realized their company needed a software engineer. End suggested Fresen, who was a teammate of his on the Carnegie Mellon cross-country team in 2005. Fresen was still a senior at Carnegie Mellon and had committed himself to working for IMC, a marketing agency that uses computer software to manage stocks. Despite this commitment, Fresen was becoming increasingly involved with Shoefitr, and even slept through his commencement ceremony after staying up until 3 a.m. the night before designing software. 
For the following seven months, the three continued their normal jobs while developing the Shoefitr idea on the side. The company could not be developed anymore without End, Fresen, and Wilkinson working full-time on it, and they agreed to move back to Pittsburgh in January 2009.
There were still major concerns regarding the company’s success despite its solution to a problem of nearly every online shoe retailer. End and Wilkinson both had money saved up from their prior jobs to cover several months of payless product development, including two custom-made scanning machines.
But Fresen was only seven months out of college, had been living at home, and faced “enormous amounts of pressure” from his family to stay at IMC. “When you’re in school, life is broken up into nice little chunks,” Fresen said. “[Everything] is just one big step on ‘The Path.’ Once you’re out of school, that disappears.... I found myself staring down the rest of my life without a plan. I couldn’t deal with that.”
However, the three were able to win a $25,000 grant from AlphaLab, a local company that funds top startup companies. Additionally, they fundraised $100,000 with the help of Innovation Works, another local company that invests in technology startups. The money helped, but their doubts remained. With no direct competing company, the three had to gather all the shoe fitting data themselves. “It’s a dirty business,” End said. “It required scanning every pair of shoes in all available local stores.”
“We were still scared we wouldn’t be successful at building a product people wanted, and there were some depressing days where it seemed like everything was falling apart,” End said, referring to the process of pitching Shoefitr to major shoe companies, which they were unable to name due to a confidentiality agreement. “We had no credibility, and no widespread interest, so companies felt that they could push us around.... We would go to sleep thinking things were all falling apart and then would wake up and start working again.”
After five months of searching, the trio found its first client in Running Warehouse, a nationally recognized California-based running store.
Despite the shoppers that loyally use Running Warehouse’s website, Shoefitr has still cut shoe return rates by 20 percent. 85 percent of customers said the technology was useful, leaving shoppers 25 percent more likely to purchase again.
“We’ll charge the next company double. Right now we need to be everywhere,” Fresen said, referencing how widespread interest in the product would give them leverage over larger companies who were interested in using Shoefitr technology. Currently, Shoefitr is in discussions with companies interested in using the 3-D fitting technology for products such as motorcycle boots and helmets, high heels, and bras.
“Last year Zappos lost $1.5 billion in returns,” Fresen said. “60 percent of that was with fitting problems. If we reduce fitting problems to 30 percent, we’re saving them about $500 million. Asking for $5 million per year between the three of us wouldn’t be outrageous.”
For now, the three remain in their shared Shadyside apartment. Shoes and beer cans cover most counter spaces, except what is occupied by their unplugged television, since they refuse to pay for cable. Their current residence more closely resembles the college houses they frequented as undergraduate students, but within the next year they expect brand recognition to bring them out of the apartment and into the spotlight for solving sizing discrepancies for online shoppers.
“It’s not trendy, but it solves a problem,” Fresen said.

ALLIES observed the National Day of Silence in the University Center last Tuesday. The Day of Silence is sponsored nationally by the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) and was officially observed this year on April 15. Carnegie Mellon observed the Day of Silence later than the official date, which fell during Carnival. 
According to GLSEN’s website, “The National Day of Silence is a day of action in which students across the country take some form of a vow of silence to call attention to the silencing effect of anti-LGBT bullying and harassment in schools.” The Day of Silence has been commemorated across the country since 1997.
Carnegie Mellon was not alone among Pittsburgh schools in its observation; Ida Mayer, a senior computer science major and the vice president of ALLIES, said that the Day of Silence was commemorated at most of Pittsburgh’s colleges. 
The University of Pittsburgh’s student newspaper, The Pitt News, reported that 25 Pitt students participated in a “Breaking the Silence” rally, in which they ended their day-long silence by marching around the Pitt campus. According to the official Day of Silence blog, GLSEN’s Pittsburgh group held its own “Break the Silence” party as well.
ALLIES President and senior computer science major Stephanie Federwisch said that ALLIES has observed the Day of Silence since at least 2006. Traditionally, students gather on the Cut, where they place duct tape on their mouths and hold signs with information on hate crimes and obstacles faced by gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered youth. 
This year’s signs, for instance, included information on Tyler Clementi, one of many gay teens who committed suicide last fall, and on the It Gets Better project, which was created by sex columnist Dan Savage in response to the suicides. This year, due to rain, the event was moved inside the University Center.
“It sort of worked in our favor that it had been raining,” Federwisch said. “You usually have some people hang out outside, some people hang out inside, but everyone was inside this year.”
Mayer agreed. “The nice thing about being in the UC was there were a lot of people who were staying there, instead of just walking by, which meant that people read all of the signs we had,” she said. “People really saw what we were doing, instead of just walking past us.”
This year’s turnout was low compared to previous years, with generally only one person at a time holding signs. However, Federwisch believes that the low participation may have had an upside as well; she said that since one person had to cycle through holding all the signs, some people stuck around to see what the next sign would say.
Mayer and Federwisch said that the response to the event was generally positive. “I don’t know that we’ve ever had anyone come up against us, really,” Federwisch said. “We’ve had mostly just support, or just [people who were] confused.”
The point of the Day of Silence, Mayer said, was not to change people’s minds, but to raise awareness. “I really think that awareness is the most important thing we can do on a campus like this, because people are so positive,” Mayer said. “But they think that everybody is this positive, and there’s nothing left to do. And so when they realize that hate crimes are real, and that they exist, and that they’re happening now, and around us, it changes people’s perspectives in a large way.... Not everywhere is as perfect as it is here.”
The event may have succeeded in its goal, according to Federwisch. “We had one person who came up to me ... and asked me several times, because I was holding all of the signs at this point, ‘Okay, next one, okay, next one, okay, next one,’ ” Federwisch said. “And after about five or six of them, he says, ‘Okay. How can I help?’ ”

Friends’ opinions and relatives’ suggestions are often important factors in people’s everyday decisions. What if one application were able to synthesize all of their recommendations into one source through Facebook?
That is exactly what Jonathan Chu, a senior computer science major, and Anlu Wang, a junior computer science major, accomplished with their new social recommendation engine Sense.ly. 
Todd Eisenberger, a senior computer science major, and Ryan Pearl, a junior computer science major, also aided in the project. A program called Project Olympus aided in Sense.ly's transition from the university to the business environment.
Chu originated the idea for Sense.ly in his everyday search for high-quality restaurants in Pittsburgh, especially since he often relied on the advice of his friends. “I figured I’d make it easy to ask friends for recommendations and then get a machine learning algorithm to verify them for you. I didn’t want to stop at restaurants, however, so we’ve added other categories such as movies, TV shows, etc., to help flesh out the types of recommendations,” Chu said via e-mail.
By visiting the website, students can sign up and use the app on Facebook. Then, recommendations will begin to show up in the student’s News Feed, based upon both friends’ ratings and the individual ratings that the student gives to restaurants and movies. Any ratings given by those in a person’s networks will appear as well.
“Whenever you rate items, it powers our machine learning algorithm. Telling Sense.ly about what you like and dislike lets us learn your tastes. The more things you rate, the more accurate our algorithm becomes,” Chu said.
Carnegie Mellon provided Chu and Wang with experience in algorithms and building large, well-designed systems. Chu especially recommended 15-251, Great Theoretical Ideas in Computer Science; 15-451, Algorithm Design and Analysis; and 15-410, Operating System Design and Implementation. “The computer science undergraduate program at Carnegie Mellon lays a solid and rigorous foundation in abstract, analytical, and creative thinking skills, transcending any technology fad of the day,” Jeannette Wing, head of the computer science department, said in an e-mail.
Project Olympus, founded in January 2007 by computer science professor Lenore Blum, seeks to provide support from the earliest stages of business development for both faculty and students at Carnegie Mellon. Members of the Sense.ly project took advantage of this opportunity.
“Project Olympus is a Carnegie Mellon innovation center that assists students and faculty in exploring the commercial potential of their research and innovations by providing mentoring, micro grants, startup advice, incubator space and connections for faculty and students across campus and with the wider regional, national and global business communities,” Blum stated. “A key goal is to augment and accelerate the process of moving groundbreaking research and great ideas to development and business stages. [Its] bustling incubator space for students is located off Craig Street.”
Developed projects are named PROBES, PRoblem-Oriented Business Explorations. Project Olympus offers guidance through its in-house business adviser, Kit Needham, and embedded entrepreneur, Babs Carryer. 
To date, there have been 72 PROBES from across the university, of which 44 have formed into companies. Of the 44 companies, students formed 31 and faculty 13. At least 180 students have found guidance from the program since its origination. One of the first faculty PROBES to find business success was reCAPTCHA, a project led by Luis von Ahn, an assistant professor of computer science and now a member of the executive board of Project Olympus.
Sense.ly is currently in the PROBES stage in the Project Olympus program. Chu and the other creators of Sense.ly are working closely with the program and its advisers to further the project.
“Students work at their own speed. Some teams want to meet with me regularly,” Needham said via e-mail. “Others call upon me when they need advice, a contact or help with a specific problem. We provide basic education on the Dos and Don’ts of forming business teams, starting a business on an F-1 student visa, [and] legal workshops (in cooperation with University of Pittsburgh’s Innovation Practice Institute). These events also help students from various schools and backgrounds to connect with each other to form diverse business teams.”
More information on how to join the social recommendation engine, as well as learn about opportunities provided by Project Olympus, can be found at Sense.ly's and Project Olympus' websites, respectively.

Mr. Beaux Arts 2011 is the College of Fine Arts’ version of a male beauty pageant; students compete for the highest score in a series of categories including formalwear, a talent outside of their respective major, “wow-wear,” and an interview. A portion of each contestant’s scores was also dependent on monetary donations from the audience for a music philanthropy under Sigma Alpha Iota. The event, which occurred last Saturday in Kresge Recital Hall, was followed by a small reception with free refreshments.
“This is our first year; we’re hoping for another,” said Jamie Burrows, a junior music major and one of the organizers. “One of the sisters of Sigma Alpha Iota actually came up with the idea. It was inspired by the events Mr. Fraternity and Mr. Engineer; we thought, where better to have a pageant than in the College of Fine Arts?”
There were contestants representing each major in the College of Fine Arts. Contestants were art majors Casey Li Brander, a senior, and Jimmy Krahe, a sophomore; Tim Napoli, a first-year design major; Luka Glinsky, a sophomore drama major; and Sean Pack, a junior music major. The contestants gained points for originality and creativity within each of the four rounds. In particular, the “wow-wear” and talent portions seemed to be the most crowd-pleasing and entertaining. The “wow-wear” was inspired by the TLC show Toddlers and Tiaras, in which toddlers dress up in flamboyant costumes and perform a themed dance. “I work at the [Carnegie] Museum of Natural History so I see a lot of Boy Scout and Girl Scout troops come through,” Napoli said via e-mail on his “wow-wear” performance. “So I thought it would be tongue-in-cheek to make myself into a gay Boy Scout since that organization is very adamant about not allowing LGBT people to participate.”
“My favorite was definitely Sean Pack, but that might be a little biased,” said Jesse Soracco, a junior music major and attendee of the event. Burrows, on the other hand, said that one of her favorites was Tim Napoli, who won the entire competition. “He was a big favorite,” Burrows said. “Another was Casey Brander, the only female competitor, who got by far the most nominations from the School of Art and did a very good job.”
Although the competition was originally meant for male students, Brander received such a significant number of nominations from other art students that the organizers allowed her to compete. Despite the surprise of a female in the competition, the event still seemed to entertain the audience members. “Actually the whole thing was really funny, more so than we thought. The contestants got really into it,” Burrows said.
The final round of competition was based on the individual contestants’ ability to raise donations for the event’s philanthropy, Sigma Alpha Iota Philanthropies, Inc. Although admission was free for audience members, they could show support for their favorite contestant by donating to them. “We had judges that awarded points for events, and only the top three scorers got to [the] donation round,” Burrows said. “The final round was based solely on the amount of money each contestant raised. The top winner raised $80. That’s pretty good for our first year.” All the proceeds of the final round went directly to the philanthropy.
Sigma Alpha Iota Philanthropies, Inc. was created in 1974 as a tax-exempt, nonprofit organization. It is the charitable arm of Sigma Alpha Iota, the international music fraternity. According to the organization’s website, “Its mission is to promote all aspects of music creation, performance and scholarship; and encourage service for and through music on the campus, in the community, in the nation, and throughout the world.”
Sigma Alpha Iota Philanthropies, Inc. creates projects that are designed to promote music, aid and recognize those learning or serving in any field of music, raise the standards of music among students and teachers, and develop stronger bonds of musical interest and understanding among students. “Sigma Alpha Iota is a great organization,” Soracco said. “I’m not sure if [the organizers] had a specific cause in mind for thus event, but I’m sure that no matter whether they did or not, the money will be going to a good, unique cause. They do wonderful arts-related philanthropy work.”
Overall, Mr. Beaux Arts 2011 raised over $120 for the musical philanthropy. Both the contestants and crowd seemed to enjoy the event as the evening ended with the reception. “I would be happy to see the event happen again,” Soracco said. “However, while I liked it and it did pull in a nice bit of money, I would like to see a larger and broader turnout in the future. People came to support their friends, but it didn’t seem like many people outside of the College of Fine Arts came, unfortunately.”
“I had a blast,” Pack said via e-mail, agreeing with Soracco’s hopes for the event’s future. “I hope to see this event grow next year and maybe have more competitors and a larger audience!”

School celebrates Earth Day with rare birds and bicycles
Carnegie Mellon’s College of Engineering and its Steinbrenner Institute for Environmental Education and Research hosted an event, titled “Flying High and Heels on Wheels,” in celebration of Earth Day last Thursday. The event included an exhibit of peregrine falcons in the Scaife Hall garden, as well as a bicycle challenge. The event was free and open to the public, and refreshments were served.
Earl Schriver, a falconer and Pittsburgh native, demonstrated to the crowd how the falcons feed and survive in today’s ecosystem. Schriver has been a breeder of rare birds since the late 1940s and is a veteran in the field of caring for falcons.
During the event, he displayed a 3-week-old Great Horned Owl named Bubba; Lizzy, a 4-year-old hybrid falcon with an Asiatic pedigree; J.R., a 4-year-old peregrine falcon; Lucky, a 3-year-old red-tailed hawk; and Nelly, a 9-year-old goshawk. Schriver gave a live demonstration of each of the birds’ abilities.
Following the demonstration was the bicycle challenge portion of the event. Pittsburgh residents were asked to forego their vehicles and ride a bicycle to work. A specially designed two-wheel-drive bike made by Paul Fischbeck, a Carnegie Mellon professor of social and decision sciences and engineering and public policy, made its debut. Prizes and awards were given out to those who completed the bicycle challenge.
INI to host forum on female global leadership force
The Information Networking Institute (INI) will host a panel focused on women in the global workplace, titled “Women and Economy Forum,” this Tuesday from 1 to 2 p.m. in the INI on Henry Street. 
The forum will include global business leaders, who will discuss the reasons why women are becoming the largest economic force in the world.
“Women have become an influential force in the global marketplace not only as workers, but also as consumers, entrepreneurs, managers and investors,” Dena Haritos Tsamitis, director of the INI, stated. “Acknowledging the global influence of women on the economy is not just a matter of fairness, it is good business sense.” Tsamitis is also the director of education, training, and outreach for Carnegie Mellon’s CyLab.
The panel members will consist of Kate Sayre, managing partner of the Boston Consulting Group and author of “Women Want More”; Marachel Knight, an INI alumna and assistant vice president of operation support and project management at AT&T Antenna Solutions, Inc.; and Joyce Brocaglia, president and CEO of Alta Associates, Inc. 
The event is open to the public; however seating and boxed lunches are limited, so attendees are encouraged to RSVP.

Commencement weekend for Carnegie Mellon’s graduating class will be held in three weeks; many graduates will leave the university with a degree and with plans for either a job or a higher degree. These plans can be affected by the area undergraduate students majored in during their four years at the university. Here are some facts on Carnegie Mellon’s graduation and post-graduation history for undergrads:
69.1%: percent of students who graduate within eight semesters
$78,276: mean starting salary of 2010 computer science graduates
62%: percent of 2010 business administration graduates who went on to graduate school
43%: percent of 2010 English graduates who were employed post-graduation (not including graduates attending graduate school)

At the close of every year, The Tartan reassesses the year’s events. We present here a list of the people and happenings that are worthy of recognition. Thistles go to people and events that had a positive effect on the campus community and the world at large; thorns go to those that have negatively impacted the community.
A thistle to Mattel’s newly released computer engineer Barbie. We appreciate that the company is breaking the stereotype associated with the iconic doll.
A thorn for lack of government funding for the Port Authority. The transit agency already made a 15 percent service cut last month in order to curb its reliance on supplemental funding scraped together year by year by the county and the state. The Port Authority’s living from hand to mouth cannot go on forever. It is up to the county and state governments to find stable, long-term, and adequate funding for public transportation.
A thistle for major companies and productions’ involvement in Pittsburgh. It’s exciting that Pittsburgh is an up-and-coming city, and we are glad that companies like Disney and Google are here. We are also excited that Perks of Being a Wallflower and The Dark Knight Rises are being produced here this summer, bringing even more jobs and prestige to our city.
A thorn to the United States Congress for almost causing a government shut-down because of partisan bickering. 
A thistle to Rebecca Black. “Friday” may be an annoying song, but the millions of dollars she made off  it were all donated to Japan. She could have easily kept all that money for herself, but she chose to donate it to a good cause.
A thorn to the students who defaced the Fence. We are disappointed with the damage they caused to a widely cherished campus symbol and their disregard for campus pride.
A thistle to the Carnegie Mellon community for coming together and bonding after the attack on the Fence. Although it was a sad occurrence, students and alumni showed Tartan pride by uniting over a shared sense of tradition.
A thorn for Hunt Library and its new light installation. The lights are disruptive to students who are trying to use the library as a quiet place to concentrate on their studies.
A thistle to the School of Computer Science for opening the upper floors of the Gates Hillman Complex to card-carrying SCS undergraduates. Hiding professors, TAs, and work spaces behind locked doors after 6 p.m. is no way to foster learning and collaboration, and we are glad the SCS administration realized it.
A thorn to College ACB for filling the gap left after JuicyCampus shut down. Anonymity and freedom of speech does not mean people should debase or slander others online.
A thistle to students Joe Reilly and Sean Hoffman for reacting well to Saturday Night Live’s alleged “theft” of their creep dance. Their reaction was professional and appropriate.
A thorn to Four Loko, because caffeine and alcohol is not a good combination. This drink has dangerous side-effects for consumers; the caffeine counters and hides the effects of the alcohol. Four Loko does not encourage people to drink responsibly.
A thistle for Carnegie Mellon’s purchase of the Residence on Fifth. First-years in Oakland now have a central living community rather than being spread out in different apartment buildings. We also supports the further expansion of our campus into Oakland.
A thorn to the administration for its lack of communication regarding the construction of the IM soccer field last summer.
A thistle to Carnegie Mellon’s faculty members for outstanding work and much-deserved awards. We appreciate the high standard of excellence that they set for students and the national prestige they bring to our campus.
A thorn for this year’s student government. Its failure to make any significant accomplishments and to communicate with the student body about its work is depressing for those of us who expected more from our student leaders.
A Plaid to the Bone thistle for alumni reunions being held at Carnival this year rather than at Homecoming in the fall. From a student perspective, this makes more sense because most young alumni identify much more strongly with Buggy, Booth, and the rest of the Carnival traditions. With so many alumni already back on campus for these activities, adding one more event to the program just makes sense.
A thorn to the election process for Student Senate. Candidates do not have to campaign to win; they only need their three closest friends to write them in on the day of the election. This is backward and should be changed, because the process as it is hardly reflects a true democratic system.
A thistle to the university’s dining services for steadily improving. Dining Services implemented longer hours during the week and better options for students. This is clear evidence that Dining Services has been listening to students’ concerns and suggestions. Additionally, there have been more Dining-sponsored activities for students, which is a great new initiative.
A thorn for on-campus eateries’ inconvenient hours over the weekend. Although dining services in general are improving, most individual eateries open late and close early on the weekends. This is not conducive to students’ busy and often irregular work and sleep schedules.
A thistle to The New York Times for its new online paywall system. Asking the newspaper’s heavy readership to pay for content again is a business move that, while somewhat inconvenient, will help sustain high-quality online journalism at a time of great uncertainty in the industry.
A thorn to the ghost of the Wean Hall bathroom. ISS workers repeatedly reported being harassed and frightened by a mysterious voice while cleaning the women’s bathroom on the sixth floor of Wean. We ask whoever is behind this to respect the men and women who work hard at keeping our campus clean. The charm of Moaning Myrtle doesn’t translate off the pages of Harry Potter.
A thistle to the people of the Middle East, specifically Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, and Yemen. Wanting to have a say in your own government and taking steps to do so shows great strength of will.
A thorn to the governments of the Middle East for suppressing, harming, and killing the citizens they are supposed to protect.
A thistle to the worldwide response to the disasters in Japan, as well as Carnegie Mellon’s local campus and community efforts to raise money, recruit volunteers, and spread a message of recovery.
A thorn for the Activities Board and its choice of Carnival comedian, Eddie Griffin, for ignoring the family and community aspects of Midway. Griffin disrespected Carnegie Mellon values and traditions by using profanity and vulgar content in his act that was completely inappropriate for the Carnival atmosphere.
A thistle for IBM and the company’s collaborative efforts with multiple universities, including Carnegie Mellon, to bring advanced technology to the public through the creation of the supercomputer Watson.

Last Tuesday, April 19, the Tartan Editorial Staff voted 23–0, with two abstentions, to pass substantial constitutional reform, including the removal of the position of ombudsman from the governing documents. This means that as of Aug. 1, when the changes take effect, the position I am currently serving will be terminated — removed after seven years. They can be best categorized as seven years of neglect, underutilization, and a lack of trust.
The role of the ombudsman is one historically linked to governments (originally Scandinavian). The Oxford English Dictionary defines it in part as: “A person appointed to investigate complaints against maladministration by a particular category of organization or in a particular area of public life, such as local authorities, hospitals, or pensions.” But over the last 100 years, the concept has been applied largely to news organizations. The Organization of News Ombudsmen states that an ombudsman at a media organization “receives and investigates complaints from newspaper readers or listeners or viewers of radio and television stations about accuracy, fairness, balance, and good taste in news coverage. He or she recommends appropriate remedies or responses to correct or clarify news reports.”
When described in this manner, I believe we have seen an absolute need for an ombudsman to serve The Tartan (and the other media organizations on campus). Complaints about the accuracy, balance, and taste of The Tartan pervade the campus community. Instead of being reported to a central source where they can be understood, responded to, and addressed, they echo in hallways, apartments, and offices without resolution.
Only once in recent history did community complaints escalate to a point where the administration stepped in to address them: Following the publication of the 2004 edition of The Natrat, the annual April Fools issue. The Presidential Commission created to address the issue summarized by saying, “This publication received immediate community attention (and, eventually, that of local, national, and international media) ... focused on a cartoon that included the use of a racial epithet in a violent context; a misogynist image of a woman’s genitals being penetrated by an ice skate (superimposed by two poems that focused on rape and sexual violence); and a homophobic essay that associated lesbians with bestiality.”
While this example is an extreme case, and while action has been taken to ensure that this is unlikely to ever occur again, the processes, training, and policies of The Tartan that the Presidential Commission identified as leading up to the 2004 Natrat publication remain largely unchanged. The report lists 16 recommendations for improvement, of which only four have been successfully achieved (2, 9, 14, and 15).
In addition, the Commission’s report also called upon the university to respect diversity and support our internal institutions. The Tartan has had continued problems reaching out to a handful of administrative departments and areas that are more interested in covering themselves than allowing information of certain events to be made public. The community should be as angry with these departments’ closed nature as they are with The Tartan’s inability to cover certain incidents.
Ongoing issues:
My own, and final, report on the current issues plaguing The Tartan’s success as a university newspaper includes many concerns echoed from that report written seven years ago.
Issues with staff continue to limit the size, coverage, and quality of the news and editorial content of The Tartan. The content, layout, and editorial staff are largely untrained, entirely volunteer, and consistently smaller than they should be compared to the size of the paper they create. While many of these issues could be directly resolved if Carnegie Mellon had a journalism school, other university newspapers without a supporting academic program produce strong, original, widely read content, and this absence is simply not an excuse.
Editors remain overworked, focusing less on editorial vision and assigning compelling content, but instead on filling their own allotted page space. Many members of the editorial leadership remain over-involved on a campus-wide scale, a common problem not specific to The Tartan, with a core of students taking on a diversity of roles across the entire campus. Unfortunately for The Tartan, this involvement creates conflicts of interest that jeopardize the integrity of the paper.
Errors, both factual and grammatical, continue to exist on a weekly basis. While these are for the most part minor, more comprehensive error tracking from week to week to better assess long-term improvement should be put in place.
The digital efforts of The Tartan remain largely inconsequential; digital content is still primarily comprised of print content being reproduced online, almost exclusively on Mondays. The Tartan, like the entire journalism industry, needs to embrace the Internet and real-time news; however, how a college publication can best expend its limited resources between print and online is still an open question at many universities. Given Carnegie Mellon’s strong technical advantage, The Tartan could be a leader in this area.
Finally, advising, or lack thereof, was a major issue in the 2004 report, and I believe it remains critical to The Tartan’s success. Advising remains focused on policy and being inoffensive, not on how to conduct actual journalism or respond to the community. Either through a board of external advisers or an adviser with journalism experience, The Tartan must find a stronger source of journalistic knowledge, and the university, through the Office of Student Activities, should encourage and assist in creating that relationship in any way it can. If a successful advisory structure could be found, I have faith that it could replace and improve upon the position of ombudsman as a centralized and independent forum for community complaint. This should be a primary goal in the coming months.
The highlights:
Not everything at The Tartan is dire. The Tartan has begun weekly critiques of the paper this year for the first time, which should improve the paper through self-reflection. These critiques should assist new writers and staff members in understanding how to critically assess journalistic content. The constitutional reform mentioned above is by-and-large positive, moving to bring more of the staff into major decisions and thereby strengthening commitment to the organization, refining and detailing duties, and also forming an internal executive structure that can focus on long-term planning as well as weekly production of the paper.
The Tartan has continued recent improvement in monitoring of distribution, assessing the reach and locations of paper drops, and installing racks in different areas to make the paper more visible. The community has responded to several articles this year, including the coverage of the student body president’s lack of progress, the lighting of Hunt Library, and the vandalism of the Fence. The Fence vandalism has already become the year’s most-read article, but continuing to find stories that appeal broadly to the campus community cannot hinge on scandal, even if it is widely accepted as the most interesting news.
In signing off, I urge all of you to continue your pithy, vocal, and most of all deserved criticism of The Tartan, but please follow that up with an e-mail so that we can continue to push The Tartan into something Carnegie Mellon can be proud of.
Editor’s Note: The Tartan ombudsman operates as an independent party, and the views expressed above are not necessarily in agreement with those of The Tartan’s editorial staff. This article was edited regarding content and message as is standard in the Forum section. The ombudsman can be reached at ombudsman@thetartan.org.

On April 7, student government, represented by Vice President for Organizations Aaron Gross and Student Body Vice President Kate Smith, filed a formal complaint against six students who were accused of vandalizing the Fence in March. The complaint alleged that each of the six students was responsible for two charges: destruction of university property and conduct unbecoming a Carnegie Mellon student.
As part of the outcome of a mediation between the students and student government, the students charged agreed to write a statement about the incident that would appear in The Tartan.
The following statement from the six students charged appears verbatim and has not been edited by student government or The Tartan. It reflects only the opinions of the students charged. For legal and privacy reasons, the six students are not identified by name.
First and foremost, we would like to express our regret for this incident and apologize unconditionally to the university community. We now understand what a sensitive issue this is, and in turn what a thoughtless act it was. In hindsight, we agree that what we did was insensitive, seeing as the Carnegie Mellon community takes much pride in the Fence, and it is one of, if not the most prominent symbol on campus. Having seen the negative impact it had on the community, we feel remorse. 
We did not comprehend the emotional ties in connection with the Fence or that it would offend so many so deeply, and we never had any intention of offending those who were or still are offended. We understand now that, most importantly, we must think before we act, respect other people’s feelings, and be much more responsible. The consequent uproar within the School of Art and the larger CMU community should have been anticipated by us, and we take full responsibility for our actions.
Second, we hope that after we have a chance to describe what happened, the university community will agree that, despite appearances, there was an utter lack of malicious intent in what we did to the Fence. The act began entirely spontaneously out of curiosity, and that led to a progression of events that got out of hand. We believe it may have been generally misconstrued in this sense, for this was not a premeditated act. It was merely spurred by curiosity and an interest in the Fence, and was most certainly not intended to be an attack or aggressive act against the university, community, or symbol of the institution. We now understand how it may have been perceived that way, for the Leatherman and hacksaw utilized have a very destructive connotation. However, our flawed thought process in introducing these tools was an attempt to try to open up layers of paint cleanly. Many believe the tools were used to try to vandalize and destroy the Fence; they were not.
Having said this, we would now seek proper permission prior to engaging in contact with any student or campus property.

When I read the Tartan Board’s recent editorial, “Increasing college debts should motivate students to make most of expensive education,” I was disappointed in the board’s view that the whole point of a college education is to prepare for a job. As an H&SS alumna, I couldn’t disagree more.
The point of going to college isn’t just to prepare for a job — that’s the point of professional school or trade school. The point of college is to get an education that will help introduce you to new ideas and new ways of thinking, and to discover diverse viewpoints that might change the way you view the world.
It is true that no matter which program you’re enrolled in, you’ll gain valuable skills to help you succeed in a future career, but it is also true that you get so much more out of an education than that. In addition, especially in H&SS, the knowledge that you gain will be far less important to a career than the skills you develop, which well help with far more than just a job. I hope that, in the future, students will realize that if “getting the most” out of an education just means adequately preparing for a job, they aren’t actually getting the most out of college at all, because college is about so much more than a job.

Over the past 15 years, teen cigarette usage has seen a steady drop; that is, until a few years ago. Cigarette use has been carefully weaned out of much of popular media and been battled by anti-smoking education with the help of the FDA. 
In spite of these measures, they’ve unfortunately resurfaced as sources of comfort and pleasure for many young adults.
Cigarettes, unlike alcohol, are available as early as 18, putting them in the hands of a large number of high school students who are the most susceptible to cigarette addiction. Because of this, many states are pushing the legal age up to 19. Raising the legal smoking age to 19 limits the chances of teens getting access to cigarettes, at least in theory. In my experience, one of the biggest problems with increasing the age limit is that it also increases the demand, making young adults more interested in finding ways to subvert the law.
One of the major draws of cigarette smoking is that it seemingly facilitates conversation, and the idea of “bumming a cigarette” is one that all smokers are familiar with. While this would be difficult in a society of non-smokers, recent statistics show that there are plenty of people willing to share cigarettes with teenagers under the legal age, even showing signs indicating that smoking might be on the rise for teenagers as young as eighth grade. While continuing to raise the age will make it impossible for high school students to purchase cigarettes on their own, I feel that the social dynamic that surrounds smoking is something that is much harder to tackle.
A major booster in recent cigarette sales was the introduction of electronic cigarettes in 2006. Electronic cigarettes, termed “e-cigarettes,” are electronic devices created to mimic cigarettes while reducing the negative health effects associated with regular cigarettes. As it stands, e-cigarettes do not have an age restriction (except in New Jersey), so any teenager with a few dollars has access to them. Many states are moving toward imposing an age limit, but this will only serve to put them on the same level as regular cigarettes. Most of the e-cigarette industry welcomes age restrictions, and acknowledges the risks associated with the e-cigarette’s nicotine content. Its marketing is targeted at those who are trying to quit, as well as those who are looking for a healthier way to smoke.
I believe that this lack of information is something that the companies are cashing in on. By introducing a new product, e-cigarette companies are able to attract people who aren’t interested in normal cigarettes. Regular paper cigarettes emit second-hand smoke that has resulted in their being banned from public spaces. E-cigarettes, however, use batteries to create an invisible burn. While these are cutting down on the amount of second-hand smoke, some of them still have the same amount of nicotine as regular cigarettes. The e-cigarettes are just as addicting as any other cigarette, and they may be just as dangerous. The health implications of e-cigarettes are still uncertain, but many critics are worried that they will serve as a gateway drug. The current problem is that e-cigarettes are more attractive to consumers who don’t want to be kicked out of restaurants or be seen blowing big clouds of smoke. While many customers are led to believe that e-cigarettes are healthier alternative to paper cigarettes, the FDA has conducted a number of tests already proving that e-cigarettes do contain a number of toxic chemicals.
Tobacco companies have been fighting to find ways to advertise for cigarettes since receiving surgeon general restrictions in 1964. 
They have been almost completely under the radar after 1997, when the infamous Joe Camel campaign was ended after pressure from Congress. While the backlash from this advertisement did a severe amount of damage to cigarette companies, they have continued to survive under the radar ever since. 
The cigarette companies know that an age restriction on e-cigarettes won’t stop teenagers from smoking; the cultural practice of sharing cigarettes has become its major selling point, and it will likely include e-cigarette smokers as the laws start to catch up with them. The FDA needs to directly target the social aspects of smoking if it hopes to find a method to halt its growing popularity. 
Raising the legal age is a possible counter to the increase in cigarette usage, but states have been facing a lot of difficulty. 
Unless state governments can admit that cigarettes have once again become a major problem, we may be seeing more smokers in the coming years.

Many people have said that Glee is a show that had a flash of brilliance, and then settled into a humdrum of so-so episodes that appealed to the baser nature of teenagers. Others have said that the show is passé and was doomed from the start because of its incorporation of song and dance. I would humbly have to disagree. 
This show has received a lot of flak for its sometimes-racy subject material and willingness to tackle controversial social issues. However, the message sent out from Glee is always one of tolerance and acceptance, a very noble one.
Glee is an extremely impressive show when analyzed. It caters to a wide demographic of young people and to those who are on the fringes of society, yet the show still manages to draw in fans of all ages through characters like Will Schuester and Sue Sylvester. With a diverse range of characters who all have some sort of label or stereotype imposed on them, Glee provides its audience with multiple instances to relate to and connect with the show.
By making underdogs the stars of the show, Glee has captured an audience that has been left out in the cold for quite a while. Not only has the show captured this audience, but it has also significantly influenced it. By creating characters like Tina, who had a stutter at the beginning of the show, Glee strives to change the lurking belief that kids' problems are inherent. Tina later reveals that her stutter is something she made up in order to keep people away from her.
Just as it was revealed that Tina’s stuttering problem was actually a result of outside forces, Glee continues to reveal arbitrary societal standards and rules. For instance, when Puckerman’s new and serious love interest turns out to be Lauren, the overweight school bully, even I was a bit up in arms. My first thought was, “Puck’s too hot for her!”
In retrospect, I reacted this way because I have been conditioned to believe that a hot guy is naturally going to be attracted to a hot girl, and vice versa. Shame on me for allowing such irrational logic to perpetrate my thoughts. 
And it is these sorts of sly thoughts that Glee is very adept at bringing its viewers face to face with, allowing the audience to see the absurdity in much of society. 
By tackling big issues like homosexuality, body image, feminism, religion, teen pregnancy, and sex education, Glee proves that it is an extremely socially aware show that understands what teenagers, and people in general, are dealing with. The overwhelmingly positive worldwide response to the show is a testament to its far-reaching effects.
Aided by the singing, dancing, and culturally relevant humor in each episode, the show makes each issue palatable to the public. Glee hearkens back to the days when an actor didn’t just act; he sang and danced as well. Armed with this creative triple threat and social awareness, Glee has the potential to become a long-running show that does more than just entertain.

You’ve worked hard and dealt with a lot of drama, to say the least. This week, as you prepare for finals and summer, do so knowing that you’ve accomplished a lot and you deserve nothing but good things.
If you’re a graduating Taurus, then you must learn the Carnegie Mellon fight song before you go. Don’t you want to show your Tartan pride once you’ve left school?
I know you have a to-do list in your planner or online, but trust me, your real to-do list consists of only two things: eating and sleeping.
Maybe you should at least talk to someone in your class before the final; I have a feeling that you haven’t opened the book yet.
Knock, Knock. (Who’s there?) Depressed. (Depressed who?) Depressed you!
Don’t upset yourself more this week by playing songs like Vitamin C’s “Graduation Song” or “Time of Your Life” by Green Day. Yes, leaving Carnegie Mellon and going out into the real world can be sad, but don’t rub it in.
While studying abroad this summer, make sure not to fall in love with the first hot person you see that has a cute foreign accent... wait ’til the third.
I know that they’re annoying and haven’t gotten much work done, but don’t kill your group members. You need them to pass your class and getting rid of them this late in the game would be quite pointless.
Don’t make yourself more riled up this week by playing songs like Alice Cooper’s “School’s Out for Summer.” Yes, leaving Carnegie Mellon and going out into the real world can be awesome, but don’t rub it in.
Music can heal everything. This week, instead of stressing and worrying about the world, just turn up the music and let the notes carry you away.
Make sure you don’t find yourself in an Avenue Q situation this summer. Take plenty of pictures before the school year is over.
You can do it. You will make it to the end and will not fail. You can do it!
