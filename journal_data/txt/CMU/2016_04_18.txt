Last Friday and Saturday, organizations from all over the Carnegie Mellon campus competed in Sweepstakes, better known as Buggy, in which teams construct a pushable vehicle called a buggy and then race these buggies on the roads near campus. The buggies have one passenger and are propelled by a person who pushes the vehicle from the rear. This yearly competition is always a highlight of Carnegie Mellon's Spring Carnival.
The Buggy prelims did more than just get things rolling in the competition, as perfect weather conditions saw incredible performances in the qualifying round.  Student Dormitory Council’s (SDC) men’s A team highlighted the round with a record shattering 2:02.499, over two seconds faster than the previous mark.
SDC had huge success on the day, winning qualifiers with both the top women’s team and the top men’s team.  SDC also crowded the finals field with their teams, sending both the women’s and men’s A, B, and C teams to the finals.  With six teams in the finals, including the top two, this was arguably one of the most successful days for a single buggy program in history.  
The other teams making the finals from the women’s side were CIA, Fringe, SPIRIT, and Fish.  On the men’s side CIA, SPIRIT, Fringe, and Sig Ep were the other squads to make a run to the next round. 
In addition to SDC’s three teams in the women’s final, CIA sent two, with Fringe coming a little short of getting a second team into the 8-team final.  SDC, CIA, and Fringe each entered four teams on both the women’s and men’s sides, and SPIRIT entered three teams into the women’s race, and four teams into the men’s race.
The day started off bright and early, with Robo-buggy opening up competition with a somewhat speedy run, putting together a 3:33 performance, which was about 20 seconds off the mark from last year.  After the robotic exhibition, it was time to get to the women’s side of things.
The very first race showed a huge jump in competitiveness from last year on the women’s side, with SDC’s C team battling CIA’s B team in a near photo finish race that seemed to be a battle of two clear cut finalist teams.  CIA looked to have a 5-second lead going into the hill, but a late surge by the SDC squad brought things down to the wire.  With both buggies finishing in 2:47, where finalists from last year often couldn't even break three minutes, it looked like the early successes would send both teams on to victory.
By the end of the women’s prelims, it was clear that racing under the 3-minute barrier wasn't enough this year.  SDC C and CIA B squeaked by, taking the last 2 spots in the final with their 2:47 results, as Apex’s A team came up short with a 2:49.
The race of the day on the women’s side came, unsurprisingly, from the SDC women.  The A team wrapped up day one competition in the 8th heat with CIA A team’s 2:34 as the time to beat.
The women blasted out from the start, opening ahead, and never coming close to losing their lead.  Most closely pursued by Apex’s A team, the SDC women already led by about 15 seconds over their nearby rivals going up the hill.  The team built on the lead, and challenged for their previous record time with a 2:26 finish, coming up about a second short. The SDC A team, however, was disqualified since they didn't have their hands on the handles when crossing the finish line, making the CIA A team the winners. 
The men’s side saw speed to compare, with the slowest 2016 team to qualify, Apex A, finishing in 2:21, 10 seconds faster than the 2:31 it took to make the final round a year ago.  With tight competition through the day, just like the on the women’s side, the best was saved for last, with SDC’s A team prepared to make a seemingly annual run at the record books.
With football star Brian Khoury’s opening push, SDC exploded to the lead, blowing away the competition in their heat in similar fashion to their female counterparts a couple hours before.  A clean roll down the hill gave SDC an uncontested run up Frew Street with each of their pushers sprinting behind a flying buggy.  The efforts were rewarded, as SDC smashed their previous course record and brought about some talk of an attempt at the 2-minute barrier in the future.
The finals saw more domination from SDC. The men’s SDC team A took first place overall in the competition with CIA A coming in a close second. Fringe A and Spirit A took third and fourth respectively. With such an overwhelming performance as this one, SDC will no doubt be the favorites yet again coming into next year’s event.
The weather wasn’t the only factor in arguably the fastest buggy-racing days in the history of the sport.  Great weather throughout the late winter and spring opened up a window for significantly more practice for all of the buggy teams than last year. This storied Carnegie Mellon tradition continues to thrive and improve on itself every year.  Buggy races will undoubtedly be a central event at Spring Carnival for years to come.
Editor's Note: A former version of this article noted SDC A as the women's winner as opposed to the CIA A team.

The League of Legends playoff finals took place on Sunday, and over half a million people tuned in to watch the action. League of Legends is a video game played by teams of five players that each controls a character, known as a champion. These champions duke it out on a fantasy battlefield known as Summoner’s Rift, using magical abilities and attacks to defeat their opponents. The Rift has three lanes: bottom, middle, and top along with a jungle in between. Teams all over the world play this game professionally, practicing for multiple hours every day to hone their skills. The best of these teams face off in season-style format called the League Championship Series (LCS) to determine the best of the best over three months. That season concluded, and the playoffs began. Teams had to make their way through the bracket, battling each other in best-of-five series until only two teams remained to fight for the championship. This was the situation going into Sunday.
The European teams took to the Rift first in a bottle of old versus new. Team Origen, led by legendary player and coach Enrique “xPeke” Cedeño, is the experienced squad. Origen is made up of players that have been popular in the professional League of Legends scene for quite some time now. Their opponents, G2 Esports, are the newest team in the European LCS. They came straight from the Challenger Series (the minor league of professional League of Legends) and took the league by storm instantly. They finished the regular season with an astonishing 15-3 record and handily defeated FNATIC in the semifinals after a first round bye. This series was easily the biggest challenge either team had faced up to this point. G2 opened the series with the aggressive team play that they are known for, and it definitely caught Origen off guard. Origen was clearly not ready for the pace of G2’s play style, which seems to be a critical error considering that these teams were practicing against each other before this series. G2 took game one handily, and Origen looked rather displeased with their performance. It seems they channeled that frustration in game two, because it was the complete opposite of the first game. No major strategies were changed for Origen, but the execution was much cleaner. They put G2 on the back foot early by winning skirmishes and stifling the late-game team composition that G2 had drafted. Origen took game two much in the same way that G2 took game one and suddenly the series was equalized. The stellar assassin play of G2 mid-laner Luka “PerkZ” Perković, in game 3 dominated his counterpart Tristan “PowerOfEvil” Schrage and allowed G2 to essentially walk away with the game as a result of the lead PerkZ had created for himself. On the back of their impressive rookie mid-laner, G2 took game three and suddenly the veterans of Origen saw their entire season on the chopping block. Because teams are allowed substitute players, Origen took the opportunity after the second loss to switch out PowerOfEvil for their coach and one of the best players in history, xPeke. He immediately counter-picked his opponent PerkZ, and it must have left G2 without much of an answer because they looked lost for the first 20 minutes of game 4. G2 figured out a plan however, and began to mount a comeback. The young squad buckled down and started to fix their mistakes one by one, getting closer and closer to a lead every minute. Origen could not hold their lead against the relentless offense from G2, and after more than 40 minutes of play the titans of Origen had fallen and G2 Esports was crowned the champions of the 2016 European LCS Spring Split.
The North American final featured two of the biggest names in League of Legends and the most storied rivalry in the game. Team SoloMid (TSM) against Counter Logic Gaming (CLG) is always the most anticipated matchup in North America, whether it is in playoffs or the regular season. To make the rivalry even more intense, at the beginning of the season TSM acquired the star player of CLG, Yiliang “Doublelift” Peng in the most surprising trade the esports community has ever seen. Doublelift has long been heralded as one of the best players in the west, and when he left CLG for rival TSM, fans of both teams were shocked. That trade means this rivalry is more heated than ever, because Doublelift was out to prove that he made the right decision in switching teams and CLG was out to prove that they never needed Doublelift in the first place.
Game one began with an early TSM lead, and each team played very cautiously, surely due to the nerves from the sheer magnitude of the game. Once the players got comfortable however, the game quickly picked up. TSM held a significant lead until the 28-minute mark, when CLG took a favorable fight and wiped TSM off Rift. This was the beginning of the end for TSM in game one, because they never found their way back into the lead. Once CLG got ahead, the game was over within ten minutes and TSM realized they had their work cut out for them if they wanted to take the series. 
Game two started much in the same way as the first, with TSM taking an early lead. But this time, TSM did not sit back and watch CLG recover. TSM kept their lead in game two by maintaining their aggression throughout the entire game, which kept the CLG side against the ropes until they could not stand any longer. TSM looked to have regained their confidence and closed out game two in a convincing fashion, tying the series at 1-1.
Game three started out much closer than the previous two. TSM secured two early kills, but CLG soon equalized that advantage and found themselves with a lead of their own before the 20-minute mark.  The teams continued to fight back and forth, but CLG seemed to come out slightly ahead in nearly every engagement, preventing TSM from gaining an advantage. After endless small victories, CLG found themselves with a very large lead until a chaotic fight broke out around the 40-minute mark. TSM used clever positioning to dismantle the heavy team fighting composition of CLG and significantly reduced the lead of CLG. The very next fight would decide the game, and CLG took it for themselves. Thanks to stellar play from Trevor “Stixxay” Hayes, CLG avoided the threats of TSM and ultimately thrived in the extended fight to take game three. One more win and CLG would take home the North American LCS championship for the second split in a row.
But as history would have it, TSM did not give up. In game four, TSM reverted to the composition that had won them game two and went on to complete dismantle CLG. TSM played the classic “Protect the Doublelift” composition, a strategy that CLG knows all too well from the days when Doublelift was on CLG. They could not break the wall of protection the TSM had set up for their carry player, and CLG were eventually choked out. With the series tied 2–2, more than half a million people were on the edge of their seats.
Game five was the closest of the series. For more than 40 minutes, the teams traded back and forth evenly and neither could find an advantage. That was until the last fateful fight, when TSM’s Kevin “Hauntzer” Yarnell attempted an engage thinking his team had a positional advantage. It did seem that way at first, but CLG’s Stixxay had other plans. He found a way to deal enough damage to kill everyone on TSM, and then easily marched through the TSM base with his remaining teammates. CLG had defeated the fan favorites and proved to everyone that they didn’t need their former star player to be the best team in North America.

Pugwash’s meeting last week was centered around the Panama Papers leak and the morality of whistle-blowing in general. In today’s information age, any leaked data spreads around the globe almost instantly, with no chance to take it back. When is it okay to spill the beans?
Before discussing the ethics and implications of the Panama Papers, some background must be established. Leaked by an anonymous source to the German news outlet Süddeutsche Zeitung, the Papers are comprised of 2.6 terabytes of data that contain 11.5 million previously-confidential documents detailing the use of tax havens by prominent public figures.
To begin with, because the source is anonymous, there is no knowledge as to how the information was acquired. And the information is enormous: more than 214,000 companies’ documents are included, with at least five heads-of-state involved.
The Panama Papers reveal how certain individuals and companies utilized tax havens. A tax haven is a way to bypass one’s home country’s taxes by stuffing money into different accounts overseas. This is a way not only to keep government eyes largely out of one’s finances, but also a way to pay fewer taxes in general. By sending money to companies in Panama, individuals and corporations could avoid the scrutiny and higher tax rates they would have had to face in their own countries.
Moving money internationally isn’t a crime; it’s an important part of doing business. However, some of the accounts in Panama are implicated in criminal activities like fraud or drug trafficking. Even when it is legal, most people don’t have the option to move money offshore to avoid taxes, and many feel that doing so is morally wrong.
One of the first points made in this week’s Pugwash meeting was that if all of the financial activity was legal, such as shuffling money, then there shouldn’t be a problem with it being public. Because all the rules were followed in the transactions, they should be open to view. However, a counterpoint was that just because something is legal doesn’t mean it should be available for anyone to view.
Another opinion was that, in this case, the leak was justified because it didn’t physically put anyone in danger, and it revealed morally questionable behavior that might be stopped as a result. Similarly, Edward Snowden didn’t directly put people in danger when he made the public aware of large-scale spying. In other cases, like Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, however, whistle-blowing might be less justified due to the sensitive nature of the material released, like on-going, undercover military operations. 
What puts people at risk is debatable, though. While WikiLeaks did reveal military information that might have put lives in (more) danger, Snowden’s leak could have prevented the National Security Agency from using surveillance techniques that could have prevented terrorist attacks. In a more implausible scenario, the money being hidden in Panama could be being used for positive developments, which are now under attack because of the scrutiny brought upon them.
In this particular case of the Panama Papers, that last scenario is unlikely. It’s not inconceivable, however, for a situation to arise in which hiding money from the government isn’t such a bad thing, if the government of one’s country is corrupt or morally bankrupt. The Panama Papers seem to give governments more power, by revealing how people are avoiding their oversight, whereas Snowden and Assange’s leaks were limiting the government’s power by revealing to the people how the government overstepped its bounds. 
It’s important to note that the government isn’t a single, monolithic entity. While the information about surveillance weakened the NSA and other government programs, it actually strengthened the ability of the United States Congress to legislate against those actions and rein in those programs. Whether Congress was aware or not of the wrongdoings occurring within the government, revealing that information to the public created a political will for change.
At least in the United States, the government is supposed to be of the people, for the people, and by the people. One suggestion was that this meant that the people have a right to know what the government is up to, giving the people the ultimate power of the government. A counterpoint was that people could mean the people as a whole, and not as individuals — not every John Doe and Mary Jane needs to know every detail about the government activity. And at least in the Panama Papers scandal, the information leaked isn’t about the government, but instead about private individuals and corporations. Do the people, as a whole or as individuals, have a right to that?
While Pugwash might not have definitive answers as to the ethics of whistle-blowing in general, one point of agreement is that tax havens should not be legal. Somehow, the loophole of sending money overseas under the guise of “investing” needs to be closed. And although the Panama Papers only name four Americans, this doesn’t mean the United States is in the clear. 
Instead, a variety of trade laws and financial incentives mean that wealthy Americans looking to off-load their money can find more easily-accessible tax havens in places other than Panama. Regardless of the morally questionable means of gaining awareness, maybe the Panama Papers will lead to a tighter tax system.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on offshore accounts and financial ethics.

Many a person (over the age of 21, of course) has woken up with a pounding headache, forehead resting softly in a puddle of vomit against the hard, ceramic toilet seat. They know the feeling of reaching out for the cold, unforgiving plastic of the toilet paper dispenser to try and lift their heads but their necks didn’t love the angle they slept at and scream in pain as they look around to collect their bearings. The fluorescent lights pound against their eyes as they gather themselves, climb to their feet, and attempt to stumble back to their rooms before someone notices. You see, our friends were experiencing the after-effects of alcohol overconsumption.
This week’s “How Things Work” has a distinctly Carnival-themed flavor: alcoholic beverages. Drinks with large amounts of the drug ethanol what we call alcoholic beverages have been a staple of many cultures since the invention of fermentation no later than 6,600 BC. It plays a prominent role in many religious ceremonies, cultural milestones, and other social events. 
Despite making speaking physically difficult, it is occasionally referred to as a “social drug” due to its prevalence as a gateway to “relaxation” or “fun-having,” but for many people alcohol ends up doing much more than just loosening them up for an evening out. Ethanol has significant effects on people who consume it and does more to someone’s body than party movies let on.
Liquid ethanol is easily consumed and absorbed into one’s bloodstream through the stomach, which is why most alcohol consumption occurs from drinking. From the bloodstream, it is transported through the blood to the brain, where it begins to do its intended job. “Drunkenness” occurs when alcohol affects the brain’s neurotransmitter pathways, or the circuits by which the brain uses molecules to activate or inhibit downstream neurons. The most common excitatory neurotransmitter a neurotransmitter that makes your brain more likely to send a signal to your body affected by alcohol is glutamate. 
Glutamate itself is necessary for keeping brain activity levels high, which helps with learning, memory, and cognition, among other things. Ethanol inhibits the activity of glutamate, effectively reducing these factors. Alcohol also increases levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the brain’s primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. 
Since excitatory neurotransmitters increase activity and inhibitory neurotransmitters decrease it, alcohol’s effects classify it as a depressant, or a drug which depresses bodily functions. Slowing down glutamate activity causes slurred speech and poor motor function. Increasing GABA increases brain inhibition, which slows down processing and motor functions even further, giving one a sleepy feeling. 
However, not all of the effects of alcohol consumption involve decreased motor function. Once that Vladdy and Coke gets into your brain, it stimulates the release of dopamine in the brain, which activates the brain’s reward centers. 
This causes feelings of excitement and euphoria and makes the person ingesting alcohol feel much better. This effect is probably most of the reason people drink, since increased happiness is a desired outcome in most settings. While dopamine release is a positive in small doses, this effect decreases over time. Since people enjoy things that give them dopamine, people who no longer get feelings of euphoria from alcohol will continue to drink afterwards in search of that same high. This leads to one of the most harmful potential effect of alcohol, addiction. Alcohol addiction is sometimes referred to as alcoholism.
The brain is not the only organ affected by alcohol. Livers are often the organ most damaged by frequent drinking. When you drink too much for your liver to process, fat can build up and cause significant harm to your liver. Even one binge causes damage to occur, and it builds up over time.
While safe, responsible alcohol consumption can be a fun time, it is important to consume in moderation and not end up in a situation similar to the first paragraph of this article or else you risk doing long-term harm to your body. Alcohol has been around for longer than written history, but so has moderate consumption. Restraint can keep a fun night from turning into a vomit-themed morning or a liver-themed everlasting night.

Sweepstakes, also known as Buggy, is the sport of pushing small people (usually women) down hills. What makes this a sport, and not just bullying, is the Buggy itself: the wheeled vehicle containing the driver, propelled by the pushers.
The earliest Buggies were made of wood and had four wheels, and the drivers sat upright. Modern buggies have more technological tricks up their sleeves, however. Most are made of carbon fiber and have three wheels, with the driver lying flat on their stomach.
Carbon fiber is the lightest and strongest material choice available, and it is used by most organizations. Some buggies currently in use do have partial metal frames, however. Metal adds weight, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Heavier buggies pick up more momentum, but at the same time, they’re harder for the pushers to bring up to speed.
“Most orgs are moving toward lighter buggies, though,” said materials science senior, Patricia Xu. Xu was the head mechanic for the Carnegie Involvement Association’s (CIA) buggy team in the 2014–2015 school year, and served as an adviser in the 2015-2016 school year. Her expertise helped lead the CIA women’s team to back-to-back first-place wins last year and this year; she also helped lead the CIA men’s team to 3rd place finishes both years. It’s safe to assume she knows what she’s talking about when it comes to building buggies.
Some organizations, including CIA, build a new buggy every year. Old buggies are retired when CIA runs out of room to store them, and they’re most often relocated to live with the alumni who worked on building them.
When it comes to building a new buggy, the very first consideration is following the rules, lest the buggy become unsafe, or the team get disqualified. Drivers need to have at least 45 degrees of visibility, and brakes need to be able to stop a buggy at a certain distance, depending on the speed. The buggy has to be built to hold together even at high speeds or when vibrating. 
Just using loctite adhesives isn’t enough, Xu explains: “Everything needs to have lock washers [and] locknuts to make sure it stays.” Experimental two-wheel buggies were used in past years, particularly in the 1980s, but were outlawed for safety concerns.
Now, every buggy but one has three wheels. These can be arranged either in a standard trike pattern, with one in the front and two in the back, or in a reverse trike pattern, with two in the front and one in the back.
As far as brakes go, there are two main choices: friction braking or drop braking. “A friction brake works like a bicycle brake,” Xu explained, “by pushing against the wheels or the rims to slow it down.” Drop brakes involve lowering a brake pad to the ground underneath the buggy and dragging it along to create friction and slow the buggy down.
Similarly, most organizations use one of two steering choices, wagon or Ackermann. Wagon steering is when two wheels are connected by an axle, and the driver rotates the entire axle to make the turn. This causes problems because the inside wheel is traveling a shorter distance than the outside wheel, even when they’re turned to the same angle. It also requires enough room around the wheel for it to move forward and backward when the axle turns.
An Ackermann steering system has a fixed axle and each wheel rotates individually. In contrast to the wagon steering, Ackermann steering is angled appropriately at different degrees to match the different distances traveled by the inside and outside wheels. This can help with wear on the tires, as well as increasing traction and grip during turns. In the Ackermann steering system, wheels also don’t make such large and sweeping movements, so less room is needed in the wheel wells.
Less room for the wheels makes it possible to have larger fairings — the outer shells used to increase the aerodynamic shape of a vehicle. “We’ve taken our buggies to a wind tunnel once or twice in the past,” Xu said. However, she also made it clear that aerodynamics are not the most important thing in determining buggy speed. “As long as you don’t put a box on the front, and have it close to an airfoil shape, it should be fine. Buggies don’t go fast enough for it to make a big difference.”
Some of the most important parts of buggies that contribute to speed are the wheel bearings. Making sure the bearings are lubricated, clean, and able to spin freely is vital to keeping buggies moving quickly. The choice of wheels on a buggy also makes a huge difference, and the kind of wheels and treatment they get are some of the more closely-guarded secrets among the buggy organizations.
Almost all wheels are made from some form of polyurethane, a plastics category that includes a variety of products, from foam insulation to Spandex. The exact kind of polyurethane used makes a difference, and so does the treatment they receive. “If you’re watching the races, you’ll notice that some buggies don’t come out until maybe 30 seconds before the gun, and then they’re held off the ground until right before the start,” Xu said. This is because the wheels have been treated in some fashion, either by heat or chemicals. Heating up the wheels can improve speed, but it also makes the material more malleable and liable to deform if left sitting on the ground. Similarly, chemical treatments cause changes in the wheels that need to be preserved until just before it’s go time.
Once the gun has gone off and the race has started, the main speed factors come in. The pushers contribute more than half of the final time, Xu estimated. Without having strong pushers to get up the hills, the buggies won’t be able to speed down the other side on their heated and treated wheels. Once in the free-fall portion, the drivers inside the buggy take over and determine which path to take, also called a line. Although all buggies are confined to the same streets of the course, different teams and different drivers have different opinions as to which line is the fastest.
“You want to take the tangent,” Xu explained, meaning the buggy should travel smoothly from one corner to the next without making sharper turns than necessary. “Turning really hard will scrub speed.” 
Turning sharply also increases the chance of the buggy spinning out or fishtailing. Despite being a competitive race, the teams make sure to watch out for each other. The morning of their heat, the drivers will walk the course and plan out when possible passes might happen. 
“If a heat is clearly non-competitive, with a slower team, a middle team, and a faster team, they might not talk at all,” Xu said. “But if it’s close, they’ll talk about when passes might happen to make sure there aren’t accidents.” The cross-team collaboration goes to show their dedication to the sport. New members are encouraged to find a team where they fit in well with the culture and the commitment expected, and Xu would rather see someone leave her team at CIA and join another team, than quit buggy altogether.
Attending a certain number of rolls — the practice runs that take place throughout the year — is required to compete on race day. “It’s a big commitment! It’s early, but it’s worth it. Mechanics get up at 4:00 [a.m.] and drivers usually arrive around 7:00 [a.m.],” Xu said. Hurtling down hills at speeds up to 35 miles per hour takes a certain kind of person: small, of course, but also competitive, confident, and not claustrophobic. It also takes a dedicated team of pushers to bring the buggy back up the hills, and a support crew of mechanics to make sure the buggy is as fast as it can be.
The science and technology behind the buggy races add an extra layer to an already fascinating sport, making Buggy an interesting blend of athletic prowess and engineering skill.

Optical illusions, such as the Penrose staircase or the Fraser spiral, shift our perception of reality.
The idea of a person climbing a staircase forever, but never getting any higher, or of overlapping black and white arc segments that seem to form a spiral, but are actually concentric circles, is enough to make anyone dizzy. But how can we see things that aren’t even there?
New research from Carnegie Mellon University Assistant Professor of Biological Sciences Sandra J. Kuhlman reveals that optical illusions may be the product of your brain reacting to feedback between neurons in different parts of the brain’s visual system. Understanding this feedback has the potential to help scientists understand how the brain interprets sensory stimuli.
The Kanizsa triangle is another classic optical illusion. Through a series of black wedges and lines, you think you see a clear outline of a white triangle in the middle.
“We see with both our brain and our eyes,” said Kuhlman in a university press release. 
“Your brain is making inferences that allow you to see the triangle. It’s connecting the dots between the corners of the wedges. Optical illusions illustrate some of the amazing things our visual system can do.”
This visual system is the result of complex interactions between light, our eyes, and our brains. 
When the light from an object reaches our eyes, it travels through circuits of neurons in the retina, through the thalamus, and into the visual cortex of the brain. 
The information is then processed in multiple stages and sent to the prefrontal cortex, where the brain decides how to respond to the given stimulus. But not all neurons make it to the prefrontal cortex. In the second stage of processing, some neurons send information back to the first stage of processing in a feedback loop, potentially altering the signal from being sent to the prefrontal cortex. Kuhlman’s team of colleagues decided to explore how the information moving backwards from the second stage to the first stage impacts how it is encoded in the visual system. 
In order to do so, they needed a way to quantify the magnitude of information being sent back to the first stage. They recorded normal neuronal firing in the first stage as a mouse looked at moving patterns and then silenced the neurons in the second stage using modified optogenetic technology, halting the feedback to the second stage and allowing them to determine how much activity in the first stage was the result of feedback.
The researchers found that around 20 percent of neuronal activity in the visual cortex was the result of feedback, indicating that some information we perceive is not a direct response to visual stimuli, but to how the stimuli are perceived by higher cortical areas of the brain. This is a concept Kuhlman calls reciprocal connectivity, and may be the reason why our brain completes the triangle in the Kanizsa triangle optical illusion. “This represents a new way to study visual perception and neural computation. 
If we want to truly understand the visual pathway, and cortical function in general, we have to understand these reciprocal connection[s],” Kuhlman said in a university press release.
Kuhlman is also a member of Carnegie Mellon’s BrainHub neuroscience initiative and the joint Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC). This study, recently published in The Journal of Neuroscience, received funding from the Knights Templar Eye Foundation, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Undergraduate Program, the Fight-For-Sight Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health’s National Eye Institute.

A team of eight scientists from Guangzhou Medical University recently published a paper that outlines their study on genetic modification of human embryos. The team used a recently developed gene-editing tool called CRISPR CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) to study a specific section of the human genome that could be used to make humans resistant to HIV.
CRISPRs are actually DNA sequences in prokaryotic cells (e.g. bacterial cells) that help protect these cells from invading viruses. These sequences are representative of the virus’s own genetic material. 
When a virus attacks, these CRISPR undergo transcription (copying DNA into RNA), and the resultant RNA acts as a “guided missile.” It identifies the target genetic sequence in the virus that matches the RNA and allows cell machinery to destroy it. By destroying that part of the virus’s genome, this process stops the virus from replicating and functioning in its usual manner, thereby preventing infection. 
This artificial method of gene-editing involves the production of specific RNA sequences in a laboratory that are aimed for a specific gene (or characteristic) in the target animal’s genome. This RNA is then used to guide cell machinery to that location, which then works to either silence the gene (not allow that characteristic to be expressed) or edit the gene (change the characteristic). 
The research study that was carried out by the team from Guangzhou Medical University involved introducing a specific mutation in the CCR5 gene called the CCR5-delta32. 
The presence of CCR5-delta32, found in 20 percent of Caucasians, produces some form of immunity to HIV and hinders the progression of the disease. While this study produced only four successful embryos out of the 26 tested, the researchers noted that it provided data that would help develop a better mechanism for gene-editing and understanding why pregnancies terminate early. 
In their paper, published in the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics, the research team points out several details that had a huge impact on the outcome of the experiment. First, the identification of a specific sequence in the genome that would affect a particular characteristic is hard to pinpoint, especially when it is often the result of several genes working together to produce a single characteristic. Second, this process needs to be refined to account for the effects of genetic mosaicism, which is the production of two different types of cells that influence the same characteristic of an animal. 
The team also highlights the need to make the techniques more specific, so that no unwanted changes in other genes take place. In fact, this was the most common cause behind the unsuccessful embryos. The team concludes their paper by stating that although the prevention (or reduction) of several crippling diseases (e.g. Huntington’s disease) is conceptually possible through this technology, considering the ethical and biological risks in doing so, such an invasive procedure must only be performed when it’s absolutely necessary. 
Given the delicate ethics of genetic testing in human embryos, this research team used human embryos that would not have developed, or would have been abnormally developed. The zygotes were 3PN, which means that they contained three pronuclei, usually from two sperms and one oocyte (egg cell) nucleus. 
These zygotes can develop substantially in-vitro, but not later on, which is why they make good test subjects for gene-editing processes. In addition to that, these embryos were discarded at most after three days. In 2015, another study published by a different group from Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, used CRISPR to modify the gene for thalassemia. That study was the first of its kind and sparked off an international debate on the ethics surrounding genetic experimentation with human embryos.  
In December 2015, the International Summit on Human Gene Editing held at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. concluded that while the use of CRISPR in the study of “non-viable” embryos would bring about a revolution in genetic studies, production of a human pregnancy after modification of the zygote and introduction of permanent changes in a human being’s genome would be “irresponsible” and off-limits given the current state of the technology and societal attitude towards it.  
Despite their support for such experimentation under the given conditions, such research is still ineligible for federal funding.

Genetically edited mushroom avoids FDA regulation
Lately, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) stated that it would not regulate a genetically edited mushroom created by Penn State University researcher Yinong Yang. Before contacting the USDA last fall, Yang used CRISPR/Cas9, a widely used gene-editing technique, to remove a piece of DNA from a specific gene in the white button mushroom. 
In turn, he was able to alter a gene so that it decreased the rate in which the enzyme polyphenol oxidase was produced, causing the mushroom to brown more slowly. Since new genetic material was not introduced, government regulators must decide whether the mushroom should be considered as a genetically modified organism. 
Furthermore, some scientists believe that the USDA should have a more systematic way of regulating crops that were genetically engineered by CRISPR, as it could cause other, unforeseen genetic alterations.

Study suggests fossil fuels to be soon phased out
According to a publication in the journal Energy Research & Social Science, it could take as little as a decade for the globe to adopt a cleaner energy system with the aid of technological advancement and appropriate government intervention. 
In turn, the world would no longer have to depend on rapidly depleting fossil fuels, which has been linked to climate change. Benjamin Sovacool, a professor at the University of Sussex, examined the trends in energy transitions over the course of history. For instance, he found that it took Europe less time to adopt electricity as an energy source than when it was moving from wood to coal. 
Furthermore, he found many examples in which strong government intervention helped to drive consumer demand for these new energy sources. For example, France experienced almost a dramatic increase in its electricity supply after implementation of a nuclear power program back in the 1970s.

Europa’s rapidly deforming ice generates heat
Scientists are looking into the chemical makeup of one of Jupiter’s moon, Europa, which is known to have an ocean hidden underneath an icy shell.
In a collaboration between Brown and Columbia universities, researchers found that heat is generated on the moon through a process called tidal dissipation, caused by the gravitational pull of Jupiter. According to Christine McCarthy, one of the collaborators, the heat produced builds upon the tectonic activity and melting that have been observed on the surface of the Europa. 
Tidal pressures on Europa’s ice were simulated in a lab, revealing deformations in the structure of ice makes ice more dissipative to heat than was previously thought. In turn, the findings could lead to more information about the chemistry of Europa as NASA prepares to search for life on the moon during a summer mission.

Zika virus causes microcephaly, CDC reports
Last Wednesday, scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that the Zika virus is linked to rare birth defects in newborn babies. The conclusion was made after an extensive review of current research, which collectively showed the persistence of microcephaly, which causes calcification of the brain in utero and vision problems in newborns.
Back in January, the mosquito-born disease drew the concern of global health officials, who have been advising women, as well as their sexual partners, to avoid Zika-affected areas if they currently are or plan to be pregnant. 
While the new CDC report, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, does not change that advice, officials hope that the new review will better educate the public about the potentially damaging effects of the virus.

Model solves old mystery of monarch butterfly migration
In a recent paper published in the journal Cell Reports, scientists have modeled the neural mechanisms that allow butterflies to make their annual, southern migration to Mexico. Previously, it was unknown how the butterflies used the positioning of the sun and their circadian rhythms to dictate their movement.
Researchers from universities in Washington, Michigan, and Massachusetts used information from the monarch antenna nerves and eyes to gather data on the insect’s internal clock system and knowledge of the sun’s position. A circuit model was then formed, revealing an internal compass that allow the monarch butterfly to travel on the appropriate course. 
According to Eli Shlizerman, a co-author of the study, the team hopes to build a robotic butterfly that would follow and potentially help to maintain the monarchs, which are decreasing in number.

People found to be resistant to genetic disease
After sifting through the genes of 600,000 people, scientists discovered 13 adults that, in spite of their genetic mutations, managed to avoid certain childhood diseases. The research, which was reported in Nature Biotechnology, centers on the idea that the genes that lead to the symptoms of a disease are different from the genes that cause the symptoms of the disease. 
Throughout the study, analysis of medical records allowed researchers to narrow down the number of possible ‘escape artists.’ 
However, the research was also met with concerns by geneticists, who noted drawbacks in the sample size of ‘genetic superheroes’ that could enable discovery of the protective genes. In addition, a range of factors could alter the validity of the findings, including environmental and unaccounted-for genetic factors.

Holi was celebrated on campus this Saturday as hundreds of people took to Hamerschlag Hall lawn (The Mall) to participate in the seasonal tradition. This year’s event brought in over a thousand people from all corners of the diverse Carnegie Mellon community. The celebration was organized by OM, the South Asian spiritual club. OM has coordinated Holi celebrations on campus in previous years. Each year a different tag line is used to keep the event current and trendy. This year the event was promoted as 1-800-HOLIBLING: CMU Holi 2016, a play on the popular Drake song, Hotline Bling. 
Holi has exploded across college campuses and other venues in the United States within the last several years. Much of Holi’s success and spread can be attributed to social media, popular entertainment, media, and the pure and simple fun of it. The tradition of throwing colored powder has been adapted to color runs, music festivals, and other outdoor springtime activities around the nation.
The main part of the celebration involves smearing colored powder on participant’s faces in a spontaneous, lively atmosphere. In India, Holi is usually not contained to college campuses and select events. Holi happens on one day across the whole country. In a nation often divided by its brimming diversity, it is the one day people of many different backgrounds come together to engage in play. Holi is regarded as a time of new beginnings; a time of rebirth and rejuvenation.
In the United States, Holi has become a tradition with its own unique eccentricities and mainstays in its own right. Many American Holi events, for example, feature music, DJs, and performers, with contemporary Bollywood and western music. The events are usually organized and held in large venues and open locations rather than on city streets. For first-year information systems major Shubhangi Bhotika, who grew up in India, HOLIBLING at Carnegie Mellon was a truly unique experience.
“When I play Holi in India, I prefer playing with a small group of friends on the streets or a smaller more isolated location. It is also preferable to play with colors mixed with water, and we like using a variety of stuff like water guns and water balloons,” she said. HOLIBLING was, for the most part, a “dry Holi,” using colored rice-flour powder. In India, water games in addition to powder are cornerstones of Holi. 
Bhotika added, “HOLIBLING was really different in [the] number of people I played with, the very public location, use of dry [and] powdered colors, the music and performances. It was pretty awesome and is still quite similar to Holi back home, but definitely has its differences. I equally enjoy both styles.”
This year’s Holi was celebrated on March 24 around the world. This date marks the end of winter by the Hindu calendar and the last full moon of the month Phalgun, and this can vary from February to March on the Gregorian calendar. The Carnegie Mellon celebration was held off in order to coincide with spring carnival and warmer weather. 
Preparations started weeks in advance, when orders were sent out for white t-shirts for those who pre-ordered tickets. On the day of the event, OM board members worked tirelessly to ensure that the surrounding academic buildings were inaccessible to the participants, catered food was in place for serving, and people knew where to go. Around noon, a crowd began to form near Baker Hall and Porter Hall. After tickets were checked, all the participants were served an Indian vegetarian meal from the Coriander India Grill. Anticipation built as the crowd could tell the real fun was about to start.
Colors began to fly at around 1:15 p.m. as the lawn erupted into clouds of powder. Once inside the crowd, it was impossible to avoid being spattered with bright hues of pink, yellow, light blue, and purple. As the initial excitement began to slow down, the dance teams began to perform, once again elevating the energy levels of the crowd. The color throwing soon became a free-for-all, as it became increasingly difficult to recognize individuals under the coats of colored powder.
“The atmosphere was amazing; unlike anything I can remember. I liked how everybody threw the colors at everybody whether they knew them or not. It all played into an environment where everyone was dancing and happy.” said first-year Dietrich student Theo Yannekis, who experienced Holi for the first time. Many first-timers were surprised how fun such a simple activity can be. Indeed, Holi seems to be gaining traction not only around the rest of the nation, but here at Carnegie Mellon, with this year garnering one of the largest crowds so far, with over 1000 people in attendance. Curious alumni and members of the general public who were visiting for carnival were curious to see what was happening, and some even gathered to watch the performances and take pictures of the colorful participants.
In all the excitement and celebration, it can be easy to forget that Holi is a very ancient practice, which has significance beyond having fun. Recent articles published by NPR and other outlets have brought up the issue of Holi being used as cultural appropriation; whereby Indian culture is misrepresented by placing a heavy emphasis on Holi. This was in response to Coldplay and Beyonce’s recent release, [ITAL]Hymn for the Weekend[ITAL], which features an Indian Holi celebration. 
Holi is a tradition that has its roots in Hinduism. There are several themes that the festival celebrates; colors are used to symbolize the coming of spring and the end of winter. Another popular theme is the triumph of good over evil, which is the basis for a popular folk story on the origin of Holi. As the story goes, there was once an evil king named Hiranyakashipu in ancient India. His young son, Prahlad, instead of swearing allegiance to his father, worshiped the god Shiva. Hiranyakashipu ordered his sister, Holika, who had the power to withstand flames, to carry Prahlad into a bonfire to kill him. As Prahlad was being carried into the fire, he prayed calmly. Holika burned to ashes and Prahlad walked out of the fire unscathed. In India, the bonfires lit on Holi night commemorate Prahlad’s devotion, and the death of Holika. Despite the tradition, many people, even in India, celebrate Holi just for fun. The entertainment of Holi is a factor which will continue to make it universally appealing. However, it is important to at least recognize that it has a deeper meaning. 
Despite some minor hassles, HOLIBLING at Carnegie Mellon was largely successful. The event was delayed slightly due to the long lines. Because some participants did not pick up t-shirts during the tabling period, they were not guaranteed one at the event. Ultimately, the large crowds were managed successfully, and most of the issues with t-shirt orders were resolved before the main event started.
OM President and junior computer science major Bharadwaj Ramachandran said “Because of the new venue at the mall, people were able to stay closer together, and the event was accessible to people crossing campus during carnival. That definitely extended our audience this year.” In previous years, Holi was held on Flagstaff hill in Schenley Park. Last year, it was held for the first time on campus, on the CFA lawn. Each year, attendance has increased. Ticket sales were also increased due to a boost in last-minute sales from interested onlookers eager to partake in the action. 
True to the name, Hotline Bling was played as the event was wrapping up.

With Midway shifted to the heart of campus, and the warm lights of the Carnival rides illuminating the Cut, I marched my way over to the booths, camera in tow, at around 7:30 p.m. Saturday night. Why so late? Well, for one it made room for unobstructed photographs, and the blazing sun that we’d been blessed with this weekend had finally gone down. Additionally it gave the booths a chance to speak for themselves. The absence of daylight allowed the intricately wired lights to guide the way and showcase the best assets of each booth.
This year’s booth theme was "Game Night," and brought with it many childhood classics, much to everyone’s delight. From Skyrim and Mario to Oregon Trail and Mouse Trap, each booth gave its visitors the opportunity to immerse themselves in the realms of the games that we’ve all come to know and love.
While the booths were beautifully done, one concern that I shared with many friends who had also taken up the challenge of night excursions was the issue of safety. There were booths with dark stairways that were not well-lit, where tripping was imminent and frequent. Perhaps a strip of white paint lining the edge of each step would help to ensure better visibility, especially for poorly lit booths that plan to stay open at night. 
That being said, the winners for this year showed excellence in terms of safety, adherence to theme, and incredibly detailed design. 
The winner for the fraternities this Carnival was Delta Tau Delta’s Luigi’s Mansion, which boasted detailed portraits, the haunted likes of Boo, and lurking shadows that thrived in the darkness of the night. In second was Sigma Phi Epilson’s Legend of the Hidden Temple booth, where I was greeted by a skillfully crafted, large, red-eyed stone head that told the story of Andrew Carnegie and Andrew Mellon with a deep voice that echoed resolutely throughout the structure. AEPi’s Dungeons and Dragons took third, complete with a tavern, skeletons, and an ominous sign reading “ABANDON ALL HOPE YE WHO ENTER HERE.” 
Out of the six sorority booths, Kappa Kappa Gamma’s Mario Party stole the show. Of all the booths I had the pleasure of entering this weekend, the artwork of this booth was perhaps the most true to its theme, with beautiful rainbows, Bowser’s throne, and an encouraging “You are the superstar” posted at the exit in the signature Mario Party font. Kappa Alpha Theta’s Oregon Trail brought the classic game of conquering the western frontier to life with great furnishing and a nice Carnegie Mellon twist, featuring the likes of our very own Scotty. In third was Delta Gamma’s "Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?", which included beautiful tributes to the cultures of the world ranging from Chinese lanterns to a golden sarcophagus. 
The independent booths this year were very impressive. In first place was KGB’s endearingly strange and cleanly executed "Octodad." The booth was full of bright portraits of the titular character with his family. The booth was simple and tasteful, with enough quirkiness to keep anyone giggling throughout its interior. In second was Fringe’s homage to the world of LEGO®. The structure not only resembles a Lego building, but also included accurate depictions of Lego people, complete with smiling faces and painted-on clothing. In third was TSA’s "Skyrim," which embodied the iconic game with incredible finesse. The booth included a cobble-stone exterior, detailed portraits and figures and bright lights that brought the atmosphere of Skyrim to life.
The Astronomy Club took home first place in the blitz category for their booth of everyone’s favorite Windows ME game, "Space Cadet Pinball." The booth was decorated with key features of the games’ layout and was perpetually crowded, even well into the night. In second was MCS’s "Pac-Man," which was unfortunately closed by the time I got there. Its exterior was very well composed, as was expected of last year’s winners. In third was the Math Club’s Mathematical Puzzles, which, as its name suggests, was full of puzzles for booth-goers to take a moment to unravel. 
By my standards, the winners were all well-deserving, but it is worth noting that the hard work put in by all the participating organizations did not go to waste. Alpha Phi’s Mouse Trap, for example, was chock-full of adorable mice, including one particular larger than life mouse trapped behind a grid. As a huge Kirby fan, I was also incredibly appreciative of what ASA put up. 
The booths this year echoed the sentiments of our past and present favorite pastimes, and with Midway positioned right next to the rides that brought out my inner child, I found myself spellbound.

At 11 p.m. on Friday the hall outside Rangos was buzzing with funnel-cake-fueled excitement as we waited for the doors to open on Scotch’n’Soda’s annual Carnival show. S’n’S went with a crowd pleaser, Legally Blonde, for this year’s show, and tickets were evaporating fast. By the time the eager crowd spilled into Rangos, already singing the opening theme, every seat was sold. They would be full every night of the show, and deservingly so.  
Legally Blonde traces the story of Elle Woods, a brilliant, ditzy, and resilient sorority girl from Malibu, played by sophomore electrical and computer engineering and biomedical engineering double major Tara Stentz, as she works her way to the top of the class at Harvard law school. What starts off as a harebrained scheme to get her boyfriend back after he dumps her for not being “serious” enough, quickly morphs into a tale of defying stereotypes, self discovery, and learning how to stand on your own. It’s a story that’s always funny and, when done well, surprisingly emotional.  
From the moment the curtain went up it was clear the rowdy crowd had met its match. Legally Blonde is a larger than life, all or nothing story, and this cast definitely went all in. The show starts in Elle’s University of California, Los Angeles sorority, where the sisters of Delta Nu are preparing to congratulate her on what they assume is her upcoming engagement. Elle’s best friends Margot, Serena, and Pilar, played by Dietrich first-years AnnaJamieson Beck and Heather Graci, and mechanical engineering and engineering and public policy first-year Elizabeth Elrod respectively, lead the opening ensemble number, “Omigod You Guys.” It’s hard to describe the sheer squeaky force of this song. Beck, Graci, and Elrod flung themselves into the rolls of extreme sorority girls, bouncing and squealing with so much energy it was almost terrifying. We bounced along with them, caught up in the frenzy. 
The energy didn't stop after the opener. Each new character and singing number piled more life and laughs into the show. Legally Blonde is a careful balancing act. With a ridiculous storyline and larger than life characters, the musical totters at the edge of the audience’s suspension of disbelief. It’s the honest emotion of the cast that brings it back from the precipice. Sure, Elle might have a talking dog and win court cases using her extensive knowledge of hair care, but her pain and self doubt are gut-wrenchingly real just the same. 
This show got some very lucky breaks in terms of casting. Stentz was one of them. When she started singing, I’m pretty sure every jaw in the room dropped. Small, adorable, and, most importantly, blonde, she’s a perfect match for Elle. Don’t think for a second that’s why she got the role, though. First-year vocal performance major Marina Byrne, who played Elle’s rival and eventual friend Vivienne, and junior vocal performance major Grace Lazos, who took the stage as the sweet and timid, yet hilarious hairdresser Paulette, were also uncannily suited for their roles. Stentz and Byrne both raised chills with their soaring renditions of the final number, “Legally Blonde,” while Lazos broke hearts as she belted out “Bend and Snap.” 
More instrumentally inclined folks were not disappointed either. First-year vocal performance major Caleb Glickman took command of the pit and whipped them into shape. Legally Blonde has a relatively large pit, which presents all kind of difficulties, both logistically and musically. Glickman made it all look seamless come show time, transitioning in and out of his cameo as a JetBlue pilot with an effortless flag twirl. 
Though, what was really special about this show was not the musical talent, it was the people. As you may have noticed by now, there was an unusually high number of first-years in the show. Director Adam Lerner, a first-year himself, explained the situation, “So many of us were in our roles for the first time. I had never directed before and some of the actors had never been on stage before. We found ourselves all feeling like underdogs. During our first production meeting, we had 17 people in the room and after a quick count we found that more than 60 percent of us were freshmen.” 
The real-life struggles and victories of this underdog cast seeped through into the show. From the start, Lerner and Glickman saw Legally Blonde as the show of the underdog. Back when the show was still just a wee little proposal before the S’n’S Board of Directors, Lerner laid out his vision, saying “Elle’s fish out of water appearance in comparison to her Harvard peers pits her as an underdog. Elle tries to stay true to herself, never failing to be a ray of sunshine. The finale song is introduced with the line ‘being true to yourself never goes out of style.’ This is [the] final message that I want the audience to walk out with: Even an underdog can succeed, but you can’t lose yourself in the journey.” He couldn’t have known the kind of cast he would have, but it’s spooky how well it aligned.
The show was not flawless. There were missed pitches and tech glitches a-plenty. That’s what you get with amateur theater, and it’s hardly the point. The point is to make the audience buy into the experience you want them to have. And I can attest that we bought in. We jeered when Elle’s boyfriend broke up with her, screamed in disgust when her boss hit on her, and hooted and hollered like proud parents at her valedictorian speech. 
Lerner and his pack of underdogs pulled off a show with one of the largest casts in S’n’S history, sold out all of the evening shows, and had some of the best attended matinées in recent history, earning the production the nickname “the show of dreams” from the Board of Directors. Lerner summed up the experience, saying, “The final show was beyond our wildest dreams ... So many aspects of the show that were expected to fail came together and made the show what it was.” The S’n’S team set out to bring us the story of an underdog defying all odds and excelling beyond anyone’s dreams. They accidentally brought us two.

od patiently at the edge of the College of Fine Arts (CFA) parking lot on Thursday afternoon, the sound of bagpipes being played by the Pipes and Drums band signaled the start of the Midway Opening Ceremony. The student-created Booths were just ahead of the crowd, and behind them were numerous stands for food and carnival games. Over on the CFA lawn, a giant Ferris wheel and various other rides could be seen even by those at the edge of campus. With the sun shining down from a blue sky, the weather was pleasant and warm on the first day of the 102nd Spring Carnival, which was relatively unusual, but thoroughly suited the event.
After the Kiltie Band finished a song, the Spring Carnival Chair, senior mathematical sciences and computer science double major Patrick Koenig, stepped up to the microphone to welcome the crowd. Koenig thanked the rest of the Spring Carnival Committee for their work in organizing Carnival, and commented on the new location of the event, which had previously been held in the Morewood Parking Lot, but had to be moved this year due to the advent of the Tepper Quad. 
“I think this is really exciting because by now, booth and buggy are all sort of in the same location in the heart of campus ... I think it will really strengthen the traditions of Carnival for years to come,” remarked Koenig.
The Dean of Student Affairs, Gina Casalegno, also gave a brief welcome. Commenting on the weather, she stated, “What an auspicious day ... in the 15 years that I’ve had the opportunity to celebrate Spring Carnival ... I’ve never had such a perfect weather forecast.” Casalegno also remarked that she hoped the CFA parking lot and surrounding area would become the “final resting place” for Carnival, referring to the fact that Carnival has tended to move around throughout the years.
Casalegno also noted the high levels of Carnival participation among student organizations, saying “We’ve got 25 organizations who are participating, more than 23 percent of the undergraduate population participated in building Booth in less than six days’ creation ... [and] 11 organizations [are] participating in Buggy.”
“Carnival is a time to celebrate some of the best of what Carnegie Mellon has to offer ... students from across all disciplines come together ... to celebrate the spirit of Carnegie Mellon, where hard work is energizing and inspired, where creativity is celebrated and harnessed, where teamwork and ‘interdisciplinary’ thrive, where passion is regularly the order of the day,” Casalegno said.
Casalegno thanked all those involved in making Carnival happen and cut the ribbon in front of Midway, officially kicking off Carnival, and the crowd streamed off in different directions to attend the festivities.

This year’s Spring Carnival saw several changes in terms of layout and location. From the relocation of Midway to the College of Fine Arts (CFA) parking lot, to the rides being set up on CFA lawn, the 2016 Spring Carnival faced a new set of challenges. The chair of Spring Carnival Committee (SCC), senior mathematical sciences and computer science major Patrick Koenig spoke to The Tartan about the changes to Carnival this year and the challenges that arose because of them.
Koenig initially commented on the positive aspects of Carnival’s relocation saying, “This move allowed the Spring Carnival Midway to be located closer to Sweepstakes [Buggy] and in the heart of Carnegie Mellon’s campus.”
Koenig was also asked about how the CFA lawn was chosen to be the future host of Carnival. “The process that resulted in choosing the CFA parking lot as the new home for the Spring Carnival Midway took place long before I was the Spring Carnival Chair,” Koenig said. “Originally the plan was for the relocation to take place for the 2015 Spring Carnival. However, construction delays for the new Tepper Quad resulted in this being pushed back to this year.” Koenig also explained that this move was not new information for most organizations. After having previously worked on Booth for the Mellon College of Science and being on Booth Committee, Koenig said, “I recall a presentation given to Booth chairs in the fall of 2013 discussing possible locations for the relocated Spring Carnival Midway.”
Koenig also spoke about the changes that organizations faced as far as building booths. “Some of the biggest challenges were simply due to space constraints on the smaller CFA parking lot. Ensuring that organizations were able to safely reach all sides of their booth during constructions was a significant challenge.” Koenig also commented on how SCC plans to address these challenges more carefully in the future when deciding the layout of the booths to comply with “an acceptable standard of safety.” While maintaining safety for the booths was difficult, the layout and delivery of the rides also proved to be a problem. “[SCC] had to repeatedly resolve issues that arose the week prior to Carnival regarding the layout [of the rides] and access to the CFA parking lot and lawn for deliveries. These were issues that [SCC] and other university departments overlooked while planning for the relocation this year.”
When asked if he thought the change was as drastic as people were expecting, Koenig responded “There was a significant concern about the impact of Midway on the CFA building and the activities in the [CFA building]. However, it appears that the inconvenience placed on CFA students and faculty by Spring Carnival was much less than either side had anticipated.”
He felt that the transition of Carnival was heavily facilitated by “the incredible cooperation with [SCC] by both university administration and booth-building organizations.” He talked about the work SCC did all year long with several departments to prepare for any concerns that arose during the transition. He also commended booth-building organizations for being “extremely patient and understanding as they dealt with the new space constraints and adapted their booth-building process in the new location.”
While this year was definitely a learning process for SCC and booth-building organizations alike, Koenig seemed hopeful that the lessons learned this year will allow for Carnival to be a much smoother process moving forward. “Hopefully, with the knowledge gained from this year, these challenges will become non-issues in future years.”

This Wednesday marked the third and final installment of this year’s First Lectures Series. The annual series, based on Randy Pausch’s novel The Last Lecture, allows graduating seniors to reflect on what they have learned during their time at Carnegie Mellon and allows them to utilize the event as a platform to impart their own words of wisdom to current students before they embark on their new journeys outside of Carnegie Mellon. 
This Wednesday, Obawole (Wole) Idowu, an electrical and computer engineering major, and Erik Pintar, a fifth-year electrical and computer engineering and human-computer interaction double major, joined the ranks of previous first lectures speakers.
Wole Idowu’s Lecture
Idowu began his lecture by describing himself to be somewhat of a special case. Having graduated from high school at the age of 15, he initially wasn’t phased by the transition to college. That feeling didn’t last very long, however, after he realized the challenges he would be facing such as more difficult schoolwork and racism. “For the first time in my life I actually felt like I didn’t belong,” Idowu said.
Idowu did not let this keep him back. He found motivation in the many struggles he faced here at Carnegie Mellon and harnessed this to become a better individual and student. “I was able to learn valuable lessons through the many faults I made to become a better person and to grow even further than I did before,” Idowu said. He went on to list a couple of the lessons, or as he calls them the “keys to success,” he learned, which he titled with inspirations from music.
The first key, which he calls “Hotline Bling,” involves learning how to ask for help when you are falling behind. “I used to call my teachers on the cell phone,” said Idowu, which was received with laughter from the audience. He recalls interacting with teachers in his high school, asking them about their day and his performance in class. He notes, however, that he wasn’t really asking them for help, but rather how they were doing. He notes that as freshman we can sometimes be too prideful to ask for help. Idowu recalls his father telling him that “whether or not you want to admit to help ... it’s not stupid to ask for help.” After taking this advice his work improved and he noticed the advantages of taking the initiative to seek help when necessary.
The next key Idowu talked about was “Carpe Diem.” Idowu often refers to his experiences with Professor David Kosbie, an associate teaching professor in the School of Computer Science. Idowu explains that Kosbie would always tell him to “seize the day,” advice that he would often disregard with the excuse of being too busy to take part in certain things. Idowu recalls taking Kosbie’s advice during his sophomore year by taking the initiative to participate in work with wearable technology, a study that he had previously shown interest in. Idowu noted the valuable skills he learned by participating in this and just how beneficial it can be to “seize the day.”
Idowu also discussed the benefits of “working smart, not hard.” He relays that if you think you are not cut out for a certain task, such as a class or specific major, try looking at it from a different approach. Nearing the end of his lecture, Idowu explained that all of us at Carnegi Mellon are not just a number, and we shouldn’t define ourselves by our grades. He recalls his experience taking Physics II with Professor Kunal Ghosh and the struggles he faced with the class. By putting time and energy into the class he was able to improve his grade. He recalls Ghosh encouraging him to “look outside of just this class” and the positive impact this had on him.
Idowu ended his lecture with advice he learned from his grandfather, which was “never settle for less than what you’re capable of.” He encouraged the audience to test their capabilities, not only to improve academically, but also to change the world.
Erik Pintar’s Lecture
Pintar focused his lecture on what it means to grow up. Presenting one unique perspective, Pintar began his lecture with a clip from Peter Pan, who repeatedly sings “I don’t want to grow up.” Pintar sought to debunk the notion that growing up is not fun. Being a fifth year student and having experienced the turbulent ride of college, Pintar has come to the conclusion that college is the perfect time to grow up.
Similarly to Idowu, Pintar argued that we shouldn’t define ourselves based on our major or career. Instead, we should find something we are passionate about and strive to better ourselves in that area. He reflects on his initial belief that he should aim to be at the top based on grades and skills. Now, however, he has learned that it is much more important to focus on learning. “The world doesn’t need people who are plastered to gold stars, getting As, and nice résumés,” Pintar said. “The world needs people who know what they’re doing, care about what they’re doing, and [are] doing something with what they know.”
One thing that Pintar is passionate about is teaching sign language. He currently teaches a StuCo Spring class that melds sign language and pop music together. As an example, he presented a video of himself during a previous Carnival signing to the song “Back Home” by Andy Grammer. The video was received with applause and smiling faces from the audience. For the audience, the video made clear the joy and happiness that Pintar got from teaching sign language in a way that was fun and interesting for students.
Pintar also focused his lecture on the difference between interdependence and self-sufficiency, advocating for the former. He believes that we should focus on improving our relationships with others. He uses the analogy of a young child being dependent on his parents and those around him. He claims that as we grow older we tend to depend on others less. Pintar questions our depleting trust and faith in others and argues that we should seek to reclaim this. He cites his faith as one of the factors helping him to put his trust in another being and helping him realize that his life is not his own.
Pintar concluded his lecture with three key fears that many of us face. These fears are commitment, uselessness, and trust. To combat these he suggests overcoming our isolation, taking the time to stop and reflect on our purpose in life, and to regain our faith in society.
“I hope to see you when you graduate this place, as I am doing in a few short weeks, as someone who is joyful, giving, and interdependent,” Pintar said. “Don’t be scared of growing up. A joyful, satisfying life is waiting for you. Grow up and I promise you, you’ll never go back to what you left behind.”

While many Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, and Pittsburgh community members were enjoying this year’s Carnival, Project Olympus’ 20th Show and Tell captivated those in McConomy Auditorium on Thursday. Project Olympus is an annual event where students and faculty members from Carnegie Mellon present their startups and innovations to a wider entrepreneurial community. Opening the event was Provost Farnam Jahanian, who described Project Olympus as “a window into ambitious research and innovations across campus.” He explained the project’s goal as being an opportunity for students to immerse themselves in this environment so that when they leave Carnegie Mellon they will have experienced how to think with an entrepreneurial mindset and will be well equipped to deal with similar problems in the real world.
Presentations started with two Carnegie Mellon faculty members whose research is focused on the capabilities of the brain, whether it be human or mechanical. Alison Barth, professor of biological sciences at Carnegie Mellon, discussed her research on how neural circuits are wired. She relayed that a pressing dilemma for many neuroscientists is figuring out what the circuits in the brain are doing and how connections occur between them for learning to happen. She compared the brain to a bowl of spaghetti, and invited the audience to picture that bowl of spaghetti being cut in half. With this image in mind, it’s difficult to figure out what aligns with what. Barth presented slides to the audience that showed each of the brain’s synapses being assigned by type, and how this can allow us to identify how different connections respond. She hopes that her research will lead to finding a comprehensive, unbiased way to look at the brain’s synapses to determine how its circuits are changing.
Mike Vande Weghe, lead robotics engineer at the Robotics Institute, shifted the audience’s attention from the human brain to the possibilities of artificial intelligence. Weghe’s robot CHIMP definitely stole the show at this year’s show and tell. CHIMP was built for the 2012 Darpa Robotics Challenge. Weghe explained that his team wanted to create a robot that could roll in addition to walking, and could transition from being on all four’s to using its two legs, thus providing more mobility. Weghe presented a video from the competition showing CHIMP losing its balance, which was fated for all robots in the competition. He proudly expressed that while all the other robots needed human assistance to get back up that CHIMP managed to get up on its own. CHIMP managed to come in third place in the competition, which, although not first, still made Weghe happy with its performance. With this invention, Weghe stated that he wants people to know that “robots are at the point where we can do useful things with them.”
Following Barth and Weghe were six students, who each gave three minute presentations on their own startups and innovations. The diversity of the students, from all the different colleges, speaks to the potential for innovation across any field. Eleanor Haglund, a creative writing major, and Nesra Yannier, who holds an M.A. degree in Learning, Design, and Technology from Stanford University, presented two of the most interactive innovations. Haglund discussed e. e. books, an enhanced e-book software that differs from regular e-books because of its implementation of media. Haglund explains that e. e. books were created as a solution to help the low supply of enhanced e-books, which is due to their creation being time consuming and them not being able to reach a wide audience. “We’re taking the next step in the creation of enhanced e-books,” Haglund said. Yannier talked about NoRILLA, a mixed-reality educational system that seeks to “promote discussion and turn [children] into little scientists” and thus preparing them for a better future. It has been proven to increase children’s learning by five times. In a video shown to the audience, one child using NoRILLA exclaims “it was fun, I don’t want to stop playing it.”
Torrell Jackson, who is pursuing a dual Masters degree in both Business Administration and Health Care Policy & Management, spoke about Chiroproktor, a new technology that will allow its users to better understand the human body. It is a lifelike tool that allows users to practice spine repair, as one example, at their own convenience on their laptops or smart phones. Also focusing on the human body was Andy Chan, who started VIT, a company that allows its users to focus on certain behaviors that cause health problems and to identify the issue before it can incite serious health problems. VIT does this by measuring one’s fatigue index. “The more tired you are, the more your body can’t withstand stress,” Chan said. Chan hopes that VIT can help companies save time and money spent on worker injuries by preventing these injuries from even occurring.
James Laney talked about Aero Laboratories which uses automated data acquisition to increase the quality of inspection of utility companies. According to Laney, Aero Laboratories aims to take manned operations and turn them into unmanned systems. Aero Laboratories is able to take an image and “detect and classify any potential hazard,” Laney said.
The last student presentation was given by Xunjie Zhang, a first year masters student in the Robotics Institute. Zhnag presented Nimbus, motorized shoes that “will easily double your walking speed,” Zhang said. Zhang presented these wheeled shoes as being ideal for students who are late to class. He compares the invention as being like walking on an airport runway but instead creating this feeling everywhere you go. This was exemplified with a video shown by Zhang which showed him speeding past other Carnegie Mellon students around campus.

Earl Lewis to be commencement speaker
This week it was announced that Earl Lewis, president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, will be the keynote speaker at this year’s Commencement on Sunday, May 15 in Gesling Stadium.
Lewis was a former provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs and the Asa Griggs Candler Professor of History and African-American Studies at Emory University. He previously held faculty appointments at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Michigan. He is also the author and co-author of several books including The African American Urban Experience: Perspectives from the Colonial Period to the Present, Defending Diversity: Affirmative Action at the University of Michigan, the award-winning To Make Our World Anew: A History of African Americans, and the heralded book series American Crossroads.
“Dr. Lewis’ dedication to diversity, the humanities, the arts, and the use of digital learning tools to improve education resonates deeply with our core values here at Carnegie Mellon University,” said President Subra Suresh in an email to the Carnegie Mellon community. “We are honored and very fortunate to have Dr. Lewis as our keynote speaker.”
Lewis will also be receiving an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree at Sunday’s ceremony.
CMU alumnus explores the Ivy Leagues
Sean-Michael Green, a Carnegie Mellon alum from the Heinz College Master of Public Management Program from 2005­–2006, has recently been in Pittsburgh promoting his new book The Things I Learned in College. The book focuses on Green’s year long journey exploring the eight Ivy League schools. He spent approximately 30 days at each school talking to students and attending classes.
The book is not a guide for all of the nation’s Ivy League colleges, but rather offers a different view of each university, hopefully bringing back fond memories for old alumni. Green brings his past experience as a stand-up comedian to add to the humor of the novel. Kirkus Reviews describes his writing style as being “highly engaging and entertaining, with dry wit infusing this book.”
Green notes his initial adventures in Pittsburgh and his upward trek through his own college days as being motivated by a past relationship. While attending a local community college he found his work often being scrutinized by his previous girlfriend who attended the University of Pittsburgh. “I was surprised by my good grades at the community college, and I showed my early grades to my girlfriend at the time. She was unimpressed, saying, ‘Well, yeah, you can do that at a community college, but try that at Pitt!’” He went on to get an education at the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Pennsylvania, and Carnegie Mellon University, no doubt fond of the Pennsylvania area and higher education, as shown in his new book.
Green’s explorations of eight of the nation’s most prestigious colleges can be read in The Things I Learned in College now available in paperback and as an e-book through Amazon.

When the hit musical Hamilton debuted on Broadway last year, most people had nothing but praise for the rap retelling of the life of Alexander Hamilton. Its songs — which combine rap, hip hop, and more traditional musical theatre styles — and its cast — made up of nonwhite actors who play historically white characters — were an instant success among audiences, musical theatre fans, and casual listeners alike. 
Recently, however, the show has been taking a hit from historians who claim that certain historical inaccuracies detract from the racially positive message embodied in the clever lyrics and multiethnic cast. While these criticisms undoubtedly highlight the enduring flaws in the entertainment industry, they fail to recognize the steps forward that Hamilton has taken.
The aforementioned historical inaccuracies seem, for the most part, to take two forms. First, a significant number of the objections to the musical stem from the claim that it is part of what was called the “Founders Chic” mentality by The Atlantic. Due in part to the increasing popularity of the founding fathers of the country, including Hamilton, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and others depicted in the show, many of the flaws of the actual historical figures have been glossed over or altogether ignored.
In reality, Washington was aloof and often distant, a far cry from the fatherly figure of the musical. Far worse, Jefferson was an unapologetic slaveholder. Hamilton himself was in favor of big banks and, at one point, a monarchal presidency. The historical figures themselves may have had revolutionary ideas for organizing a government, but their attitudes towards many issues were, if nothing else, very much the product of their time.
More criticism stems from the fact that the African Americans essential to the country’s establishment were largely ignored in favor of focusing on the white heroes of the narrative. The New York Times identified Cato, a slave who belonged to Hercules Mulligan and who worked as a spy by his owner’s side, as one such figure who might have easily been included, yet he is not given a place alongside his fellow revolutionaries in the musical.
“Imagine Hamilton with white actors,” said Annette Gordon-Reed, a history and law professor at Harvard University, in an article for The Public Historian. “Would the rosy view of the founding era grate?”
Though it can’t be ignored that the roles of historical minorities go largely unexplored over the course of the show, they aren’t completely disregarded. Numerous lyrics reference both the abolitionist views held by Hamilton, as well as a battalion of slaves organized by John Laurens who fought in the Revolutionary War in exchange for their freedom.
While it’s true that the founding fathers get a free pass for many of the problematic aspects of their lives, the point of Hamilton was never to critique them. Rather, it aims to take their stories — stories about white men, which have been predominantly claimed by subsequent generations of Caucasian Americans over the years — and give other ethnicities a sense of ownership over them as well. 
Hamilton isn’t history — it’s fiction. And it’s far more focused on what it can do for the future than how it can reflect the past.
“[Working on the show] is the only time I’ve ever felt particularly American,” said actor Daveed Diggs, who portrays Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson, in an interview with Charlie Rose. “I think ... it gives value to whoever you are; I think it does that for everybody.”
Hamilton can also be an eye-opening experience for everyone, because it draws attention to a number of issues that are being increasingly discussed today. The specifically nonwhite cast, which recently experienced pushback after a controversial casting call, only serves to highlight the number of roles from which minorities are still systematically excluded, both on Broadway and in the entertainment industry in general. And the emphasis placed on immigrants, and their enormous contributions to our nation, is equally timely considering the present-day political atmosphere.
Just because Hamilton hasn’t fixed every problem in the entertainment industry in one fell swoop doesn’t mean that more positive changes can’t build off of its success in the future. 
We can’t fault Hamilton for not pulling off an entire revolution when in truth, it is only the first step of a process that will take far more effort and love to succeed. 
But as far as first steps go, it is certainly a powerful — and catchy — one, and it has left Americans of all ethnicities and backgrounds excited for what comes next.

Spring Carnival Booths are becoming more elaborate, and more expensive, from one year to the next. The situation is akin to an arms race: no organization can scale back, lest its public image (read: recruitment) suffer and current members and alumni object forcefully. However, building a booth is consuming more time, money, and person-power year after year. This trend is unsustainable.
In my opinion, Booth is a colossal waste of organizations’ money and resources. Many groups have a substantial, even obscene, budget for new materials that end up in a dumpster on Sunday afternoon. Worse still are booths left incomplete. All is demolished after less than three days on display, and that is simply wasteful. At the very least, a budget limit should be imposed not only to level the playing field for organizations with smaller budgets, but also to emphasize the university community’s commitment to making things that matter, making things that last.
Making things that last.
Let’s take this one step further: suppose that instead of drawing up plans for a glorified shed, talented students were to design a mural, playground, garden, or remodeling project and pitch it to nonprofit organizations and community leaders. Suppose that instead of providing extensive safety and security measures for a parking lot, the University were to provide transportation to project sites for groups to implement their plans. Suppose that booth resulted in something that would make a difference, something that would last (other than, of course, the coveted trophies awarded to organizations for projects that will be summarily demolished).
I spent two “build weeks” too many in the Morewood parking lot: the first fueled by starry-eyed curiosity, the second fueled by peer pressure and threat of fines. I saw Booth make some individuals unhappy, disagreeable, resentful, depressed, and physically ill or injured. I am displeased that our university continues to sanction a tradition which so explicitly encourages pouring money, time, and effort into things that don’t last. Instead, let’s find meaningful outlets for students’ creative talents, sense of healthy competition, and countless hours of free time during build week.

Infrastructure policy has always been tucked into the most wonkish corners of politics. The physical hardware necessary to sustain a country has always been important, but due to the relative ease of highway bills passing in recent history, it has never been a sexy political issue. However, two factors in recent months — Senator Bernie Sanders’ (I–VT) call for a trillion dollar infrastructure spending plan and the kerfuffle over the highway bill that ended in stalemate — have had the positive consequence of making the country care about infrastructure policy once again. The problem is that these two events did not provide a very clear path forward. Despite the detail of his actual proposal, Sanders rarely publicly clarifies his infrastructure stances beyond his desire to “rebuild our crumbling infrastructure” and the highway fight … actually, don’t get me started on the highway fight. The problem is, the importance of detail in infrastructure policy makes these sort of moments the best we can hope for in terms of national discussion on infrastructure. Infrastructure policy puts policymakers in a difficult conundrum. Infrastructure constantly needs to be updated for safety and economic competitiveness, but retrofitting thousands of miles of train tracks, revamping millions of water towers, and filling billions of potholes is incredibly expensive and hard to generate political will for.
Luckily, an idea that has been sitting in Congress for 30 years provides us with a path out of this dilemma.
That idea is none other than the National Infrastructure Bank. The name says it all: the bank would be federally administered and would finance infrastructure projects.
The National Infrastructure Bank would probably be an uphill political battle at first. Even President Barack Obama tried for one in years past. However, if passed, it would help infrastructure spending become free from the consistent problems that have dogged it for decades.
First, the politics of infrastructure spending could be shifted to the market, which has a much more urgent need for infrastructure than politicians who are perpetually focused on reelection. Second, the bank would significantly decrease the need for government investment in infrastructure by making it possible for private companies to undertake the massive necessary projects with federal backing. This would decrease the public cost of infrastructure as well as decrease the costs associated with failing infrastructure, which were detailed in The Tartan last week.
Our current infrastructure politics once relied heavily on earmarking for local infrastructure. Earmarks were basically banned in 2010 (this was probably ill-advised, but that’s another fight for another day), so it is no longer useful for infrastructure money. Even when infrastructure had the easy funding from earmarks, local spending was not great for large, national infrastructure like interstates and railroads.
Since this was our default funding mechanism for so long, things that require national investment like freight lines never got adequate funding and are incredibly subpar. In addition, earmarking is also hard to evaluate and is subject to lots of under the table politics. This means most transportation projects in history have been corporate welfare for local construction companies or bait to get national corporations to build factories in certain locations. Our current system relies on politicians who need to justify trillion-dollar spending programs for an issue that often ends up on the periphery of the public consciousness.
By shifting infrastructure spending away from public arena, the National Infrastructure Bank would make economic need the priority for infrastructure spending. This would make spending more responsive to needs as vital infrastructure projects move to the front of the line.
The bank would also improve the conditions for private infrastructure investment by using the financial muscle of the federal government to allow financing for large projects. Generating private sector spending decreases the tax burden on citizens to fund infrastructure projects. This frees up money for other public projects without losing quality in investment. 
If companies were using the bank for financing, it would limit the need for contracting, which can cause problems in spending projects when companies are paid a fixed rate for the job, have it secured, and then cut corners when the government is trying to keep its numbers down.
Infrastructure is a political nightmare. It’s an urgent need, but the price tags associated often get these programs pushed aside. We should create a National Infrastructure Bank to lay the groundwork for America’s infrastructure to support the nation’s economic needs for decades to come.

Carnival, and Buggy in particular, is a unique tradition here at Carnegie Mellon. This year, in addition to visiting the booths on midway, attending the GRiZ concert, and enjoying time with alumni and friends, I had the privilege of pushing for SPIRIT’s Women’s A team. Buggy has been a huge highlight of my college experience. Between driving, pushing, and maintaining the buggy, the sport requires the perfect balance of skill, engineering, and athleticism. Inevitably, I always get a rush of excitement when a friend or family member asks me to explain Buggy to them.
Through these discussions, however, I’ve come to realize that though Buggy is not a “real sport,” it is no exception to the sexism that exists within traditional collegiate sports. A clear example of this sexism can be seen in the comparison between the national buzz that March Madness receives every year and the half-filled stands at women’s basketball games. Women’s athletic teams are almost always seen as inferior and less entertaining than their male counterparts, and Buggy is no exception.
I believe the dismissal of women pushers stems from two main factors: timing and tone. Every year, the women’s buggy teams compete early in the morning (8 a.m. to 10 a.m. during the preliminaries), while the men’s teams compete later (10 a.m. to noon). Historically, the men’s heats have had better attendance. While the women’s teams may have a few dedicated fans and their teammates on the sidelines cheering them on, the sidelines are gradually filled as the day progresses and the men’s heats approach. This isn’t because the men’s races are particularly more interesting than the women’s, but simply because they are at a more convenient time.
Furthermore, there is a dramatic shift in the tone of the commentary during the men’s heats, with the men’s races being described as more exciting. An example of this can be seen in commentary given during preliminary rolls this year. At the beginning of the men’s segment, after the alumni grudge race, one commentator said “We’re about to get into the real stuff here, women’s prelims were very clean [...] what do you guys expect to see out of the men’s races here?” His colleague responded, “Oh wow, a lot.” Now, it could be that by “real stuff” the commentator was referring to races with students rather than alumni, but I doubt this. As a woman pusher, I interpreted this exchange and the shift in tone to mean that the commentators thought the men’s heats were more exciting and more important.
Both men and women pushers put in the same amount of time and effort. We all show up to rolls early in the morning on the weekends. We all take time from doing our homework to attend midnight rolls. Most importantly, we all want to make our team proud. So I simply request equal glory for equal work.
To achieve this, I propose two solutions to the overlooked, sexist practices of Buggy. First, I propose that Sweepstakes alternate which gender pushes early in the morning. One year the women should push starting at 8 a.m. and the next year the men can take the early slot. Secondly, I propose that there is one female buggy commentator. There are 23 women’s push teams and 30 men’s teams, not to mention female drivers and mechanics. Having a female commentator will help ensure that our value and hard work is fully appreciated and remarked on. There should be equal representation in the sport that we all love so much. In conclusion, I want to express my love and appreciation my teammates and SPIRIT’s alumni who have continued to encourage and support all pushers, whether male or female.

The phrase “zero tolerance for sexual assault” has been heard around campus a lot recently, including on these very pages last Monday. A change.org petition directed at University President Subra Suresh titled “Zero Tolerance for Sexual Assault at Carnegie Mellon University” has gained over 970 signatures in the past two weeks. The petition has made one thing clear: the student body and the administration are not on the same page about sexual assault prevention and punishment. The petition’s demands have clearly struck a nerve on our campus despite representing a significant departure from the university administration’s current way of dealing with sexual assault. The administration and student body need to have a candid discussion about Carnegie Mellon’s sexual assault policy. While it is high time that we clearly defined policies about sexual assault, as a campus community we should be cognizant of the dangers of one-size-fits-all policies.
The petition calls for three key policy reforms. The main policy point is that “any student found responsible for sexual assault by CMU’s University Disciplinary Committee will face immediate expulsion.” The petition also asks the administration to publish “the number of sexual assault cases which reach a resolution through the University Disciplinary Committee, the number of students found responsible for sexual assault through the University Disciplinary Committee, the number of students expelled for sexual assault through the University Disciplinary Committee,” each year, and finally that these changes be made clear to the student body “through an all student e-mail, as well as an addition to CMU’s The Word, both online and in print,” and incorporated into orientation week lectures.
In order to understand the effect of the changes that are being asked for and the way they would alter our campus culture around sexual assault we have to first understand the status quo. Currently, the Office of Title IX Initiatives (TIX) has an individual-centric view of sexual assault policy. 
According to their website, the office’s response to sexual assault “is largely driven by the wishes and preferences of the person affected by the sexual misconduct”(emphasis in original). When a case of sexual assault is reported, the office’s first step is to provide support resources and implement safety measures for the survivor. These safety measures most often take the form of a no contact agreement between the reporter and the accused assailant.
Next, TIX gives the reporting party the option to initiate a university investigation into the accusations. If the reporting party decides to go through with the process, the case is investigated by the University Police and TIX, and then given over to the University Disciplinary Committee. This committee is made up of two student board members, one staff/administrator board member, one faculty board member, and one additional faculty or staff/administrator board member, and is moderated by the Associate Dean of Student Affairs. These members are charged with holding a hearing to review the evidence and determining if an assault took place and what punishments should be applied to the perpetrator. 
The university uses a more relaxed standard of preponderance of evidence, meaning that there is over a 50 percent chance an assault occurred, to determine guilt instead of the more rigorous criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. Once the committee has made a decision about the assault charge they deliver their recommendation to the Dean of Student Affairs, who makes the final decision about guilt and any potential punishment.
Currently, there are no regulations controlling how people are punished for committing sexual assault. Generic possible punishments, referred to as sanctions, for any violation of community standards are listed in Carnegie Mellon’s Community Standards, Policies, and Procedures, and include community service, fines, disciplinary probation, suspension, and expulsion. There is no list of sanctions specific to sexual assault, leaving the committee and the Dean of Student Affairs a lot of leeway in how they discipline assailants.
The administration’s definition of sexual assault also has surprising amounts of ambiguity. The university has officially defined sexual assault in two places in the University Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault. Troublingly, these two definitions seem to conflict. Section I lists specific acts that are considered sexual assault, including rape and dating violence, implying a more narrow definition. Meanwhile, the Appendix E definition says sexual assault is “engaging in any physical sexual act perpetrated against a person’s will, where that person does not give clear, voluntary consent, or where that person is incapable of giving consent due to drug or alcohol use, or due to intellectual disability.” TIX clarified that the vague Appendix E definition is the correct one, and confirmed in an email that “actions such as non-consensual fondling, touching, groping, or kissing are ‘physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person’s will’ and therefore fall under [the] definition of assault.”
This is where the “Zero Tolerance for Sexual Assault at Carnegie Mellon University” petition runs into its first logistical difficulty. The writers of the petition noticed these discrepancies and specified that their demand for automatic expulsion is based on the broader Appendix E definition. This leaves no room for proportional punishment based on the crime, and treats someone who kisses someone without asking first the same as a rapist.
There is more at stake in this petition than a quibble over definitions. The petition demands a shift away from the individual-centric policies of TIX and towards a community-centric plan. Right now the system has the flexibility to accommodate survivors’ wishes. As a community it would be more comfortable to remove perpetrators of sexual assault from our environment, but that comfort comes at a price. A frequent concern with zero tolerance policies is that they have a chilling effect on reporting. A Carnegie Mellon Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence Study done in the spring of 2015 found that less than 5 percent of assaults are reported to the administration for review, and that “between 20 and 41 percent of students didn’t report because they believed they might be partially at fault or might be mistaken that they were assaulted.” The idea of opening an investigation that could get someone expelled when you are not even sure what happened is extremely intimidating, and sets up another road block to increasing our abysmally low reporting statistics. Some survivors simply want the official confirmation that what happened was assault while others want their attackers expelled, or some other solution on the spectrum in between. People whose final goal is not their assailant’s expulsion end up not being able to report at all.
There is an argument to be made that campus safety is at risk if we do not remove rapists from the community. One survey found 
 that 63 percent of college men who admit to committing rape say they did it repeatedly, an average of 5.8 times, so a person who rapes someone once is likely to pose a threat to others. The looming threat of expulsion could also be a deterrent to would-be rapists. What this discussion comes down to is a question about the purpose of university investigations into charges of sexual assault. Should our system exist to facilitate survivors’ recovery, or should it be a tool for justice and a way to shape our community? Instituting a zero tolerance policy would steer us towards the latter.
If our campus decides to do the former and focus on individual survivors, there are still a lot of reform options we should consider. Actually, the second and third demands in the petition, which asks for transparency about sexual assault accusation outcomes and for specific steps to be taken to educate the student body about new sexual assault policies, offer a good place to start. 
Transparency about investigation proceedings and the disciplinary decision making process is vital. The administration’s process has failed students in the past, resulting in an investigation by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights, and sometimes still continues to fail them. It’s not that the decision makers are bad people or intentionally causing harm. It’s just a simple question of incentives. Investigations into incidents of sexual assault create bad PR for the administration, and expelling people found guilty of sexual assault exposes the school to lawsuits. The only way to break the cycle is to change the incentives by giving the student body the power to hold the administration accountable.
In order to hold the administration accountable, the student body needs two things: defined standards that the administration can be held to, and information on how those standards are applied. TIX should lay out clear descriptions of what sanctions can be used to punish transgressions of different severity so that survivors have a level of assurance about what the administration has to do for them. There should be several possible sanctions for each crime so that the situation can be tailored to the specific survivor within the general framework. Once this framework is in place statistics about investigation and hearing outcomes should be publicly published as requested in the petition.
In addition to increasing transparency, we could change the incentives by giving the job of hearing cases and making recommendations for sanctions to independent investigators who are not tied to the administration. Several other schools that were part of the Department of Education’s investigation, such as Amherst and Dartmouth, have already taken this step.
The third demand in the petition touches on the importance of informing and educating people about campus sexual assault policies. In 2012 [the American Association of University Professors released a guide](http://www.aaup.org/report/campus-sexual-assault-suggested-policies-and-procedures] for developing adequate policies and procedures for dealing with sexual assault on college campuses. Four of the twelve points highlight the importance of publicizing policies and making them clear, readable, and easily accessible. The current definition of sexual assault is inconsistent, unclear, and too broad to be practical. It is impossible to teach people how to prevent assault when you cannot clearly articulate what assault is. 
This is just one example of a larger systemic problem. While sexual assault awareness and education is emphasized during orientation, this quickly peters out. Most of the general student body does not know what TIX does, and even some trained student members of the Survivor Support Network don’t understand the University Disciplinary Committee’s process. The Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence Study found that 6.25 percent of students did not report their assault to Carnegie Mellon because they did not know how, did not trust the process, or did not think they would be believed. If those people started reporting, the percent of reported cases would double.
A zero tolerance policy initially sounds appealing, with its clear-cut answers and easy black and white morality. Writing clearer guidelines, publishing outcome statistics, and using independent investigators are not as flashy or as satisfying to post about on Facebook, but they are the solutions we need to be talking about.
