The Carnegie Mellon volleyball team started their busy week by overcoming St. Vincent College 3–2 before hosting the Carnegie Mellon Crossover this past weekend, beating Westminster College 3–0 and Muskingum University 3–1 Friday night, but the next day dropping a match to Frostburg State University 0–3 before rebounding to defeat John Carroll University 3–2. This tournament puts the Tartans at 9–4 overall.
The Tartans kicked off their week by beating St. Vincent’s 7–25, 25–18, 17–25, 27–25, 15–11 to improve their record to 6–3. Senior outside hitter Megan Killeen led the way with 15 kills, and senior setter Sam Carter had 48 assists and 14 digs.
A few days later, the Tartans started out strong by outhitting Westminister to win in straight games, 25–17, 25–16, and 25–11. During the second game the Tartans found themselves behind 2–4, and after six more points still trailed 5–7. Momentum shifted in their favor when senior middle hitter Jessica Brackin and Killeen put away two spikes to bring the score to a tie. Junior left side hitter Cameron Griffin held serve for eight points and hit three aces. Junior outside hitter Caroline Size added three block assists and, along with sophomore outside hitter Megan Kaplon, registered several key kills. Carter gave 30 assists, 12 digs, and three kills, and Griffin added 17 digs.
Following the sweep, the Tartans overcame Muskingum in a close match. Brackin, junior opposite hitter Aislinn McCloskey, Size, and Killeen dominated the court with three kills apiece to help take the first game, 25–17. Muskingum rallied back and won the second game, 20–25, after being down 19–16. After a moment of regrouping, the Tartans grabbed game three 25–20 and closed out the match by decisively winning game four at 25–17. Griffin and Killeen led the team with 23 and 17 digs, respectively, while Carter had a game high of 40 assists and two block assists.
“We worked hard and put it away in three [games],” Size noted of the first match. “Hopefully we’re looking for a good season and a good run at UAAs again to get to the NCAAs.”
Carter also added her opinion of the team’s performance. “I think we played really well, and a lot of different people got to play and perform at a high level.”
The final day of the tournament had the Tartans scrambling during the first match against Frostburg, and lost in straight games 25–17, 25–23 and 25–18. Their tough luck followed them to the second match of the day, and the Tartans found themselves down 26–24 and 25–21. Brackin, McCloskey, Size, and Killeen took the lead in kills and helped the Tartans rally back to take the next two games decisively, 25–16 and 25–14. With newfound spirit, the Tartans outhit their opponents to take the final set 15–12. Leading the team in assists was Carter with 55, followed by Griffin with 29, and notable mentions by Killeen and seniors Julie Ng and Cara Fatigati.
The Tartans hit the court again next Saturday in Ohio against Mount Union College.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s football team, armed with a perfect record for the season, traveled to Geneva, N.Y. on Saturday to take on Hobart College. The trip turned out sour for the Tartans as they were never able to take a lead en route to a 24–16 defeat. The loss put the Tartans’ record at 2–1.
Hobart started off the scoring with 8:14 to go in the first quarter. A 55-yard drive culminated with a 51-yard flea-flicker from Statesmen quarterback Doug Vella to wide out Tyler Vincent. The play gave the Statesmen a 7–0 lead. The Tartans answered back with a 13-play, 63-yard drive that ended with a 1-yard touchdown by junior running back Jason Pratt. Senior Phil Pantalone was a main component of the driving, registering 44 passing yards.
The tie was short-lived though, as on the next play, Statesmen kick returner Andrew Marlier ran an 85-yard return for a touchdown. With 1:39 left in the first, Hobart led 14–7. Junior place kicker Elliot Carnevale helped the Tartans cut the lead to four before the Statesmen took back the points as the two teams exchanged field goals, the latter coming on the first possession of the second half. The Tartans then gained another touchdown when Pratt scored on a 4-yard run with 11:21 to play, bringing the Tartans within one. Carnevale missed the extra point, however, allowing Hobart to retain their 17–16 edge.
The Statesmen followed the Tartans’ three-play scoring drive with their own seven-play, 54-yarder that ended when Vella hit Hobart senior Paul Overdorf for a successful 4-yard touchdown pass. An extra point made it 24–16, and the score would stay that way for the remaining seven and a half minutes of play.
“It was a disappointing loss because we put forth a great effort but weren’t playing smart football,” said senior captain Socrates Zacharias. “Our game plan is always to rely on our assignments and keys; failing to do so is costly. Our goal is just to learn from our mistakes and come out next week more prepared.”
The Tartans will next travel to Ohio to take on Hiram College for a Saturday, Sept. 26 match. Kickoff is set for 1 p.m.

The cross country team traveled to Carlisle, Pa. on Saturday to compete in the Dickinson College Invitational. The women ran a 4K race and placed first overall. The men ran both a 4K and an 8K, placing second overall in both events.
The Tartan women finished strong with their top three runners finishing first, seventh, and 20th, respectively. First-year Emily Wobb earned her second first-place finish of the year, winning the 4K with a time of 14:38.7. Finishing next for the Tartans was junior Courtney Baker, who placed seventh with a time of 15:14.6, followed by sophomore Cassie Wallace, finishing 20th with a time of 15:58.7. Junior Laura McKee (16:07.7), first-year Eva Humphrey (16:35.2), and sophomore Alyssa Montanaro (16:36.6) finished in 24th, 37th, and 38th, respectively. The Tartans women won the meet with a score of 28.
“The Dickinson Invitational was a great race for the women’s teams,” said Baker, one of the team’s captains. “Not only did we make a huge improvement as a team by winning the 4K short race, the majority of our individual times were personal records. This race is a great indication of what is going to come further down in the season.”
The men also ran well for Carnegie Mellon. In the 8K, junior Dan Addis led the way, finishing second overall with a time of 26:06.7, followed by junior J.P. Allera in sixth with a time of 26:39.7 and senior Dario Donatelli (26:47.5) in seventh. Junior Justin Kurp crossed the line in 27:21.4, good enough for 15th, and senior Chris Rizzo (27:22.5) was close behind in 16th to help seal second in the event with a score of 15.
In the 4K, sophomore Matt Jacob finished first out of the Tartans in 12:20.1, earning second place overall. Following Jacob, junior Nate Bussiere (12th) finished in 12:36.9 and sophomore Rob Morhard (21st) ran in a time of 12:54.9. In total, the men finished second in the event with a score of 35. Overall, they finished second in the Dickinson Invitational with 44 points total.
Both teams will compete on Oct. 10 at 11:30 a.m. in their only home meet of the year, the Carnegie Mellon Invitational, hosted in Schenley Park.

In the men’s soccer team’s only game of the week, the Tartans downed Allegheny College 4–1 this past Saturday. The team had some added confidence going into the game thanks to last week’s NSCAA/Adidas Division III Rankings, which put the Tartans back in the top 25 at number 13.
The Carnegie Mellon seniors carried the team to its victory over the Gators, as Ryan Browne, Ricky Griffin, and Pat Lutz — who made two — scored all of the goals, while senior goalie Maks Khurgin contributed three saves. Browne made sure to set the tone of the match in the third minute as he fired past Allegheny keeper Andrew Shirley from 10 yards out. Twenty-four minutes later, the Tartans got their second goal of the day as Griffin took advantage of a breakaway past the last defender. 
Allegheny College did not post much of a challenge throughout the first half and the Tartans comfortably maintained their two goal margin until half time.
In the second half, Lutz gave the Tartans some insurance by scoring his first goal of the game off a pass from Browne. The goal, Lutz’s third of the season, gave the Tartans a 3–0 lead. At that point, head coach Arron Lujan looked to put in the Carnegie Mellon reserves, but Allegheny forward Pete Subasic spoiled Lujan’s plans by scoring off an initial save by Khurgin. The Tartans controlled the game for the rest of regulation and Lutz slotted his second goal of the game, ending a great week in which he tallied two goals and was named University Athletic Association (UAA) Men’s Soccer Athlete of the Week, as well as Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) Co-Player of the Week.
“Saturday’s game at Allegheny was a good test for our team. We started strong and were able to take an early lead, which was important,” observed senior defensive player John Hall. “We are still looking to improve and shore things up defensively. This year we are hoping to compete for the UAA title and advance in the NCAA tournament.”
The Tartans will take on St. Vincent College in an away afternoon fixture on Wednesday, Sept. 23. They will then return home this Saturday, Sept. 26 at noon as they take on Grove City College. Come out and join the rest of the “Tartan Army” in support of the team, as they are now playing their best soccer of the season.

On Tuesday, the Carnegie Mellon men’s golf team traveled to Delaware, Ohio, where they finished sixth overall in the Ohio Wesleyan University Lamkin Fall Intercollegiate. 
The Tartans ended the 36-hole event just 29 strokes behind the tournament host and champion team with a total score of 624 (308–316).
Ohio Wesleyan, ranked number 11 nationally, finished the event with a team score of 595. Taking second place with 599 on their team scorecard was number 19 Transylvania University, followed by John Carroll with a 608, Baldwin-Wallace (614), and Heidelberg (619). Muskingum finished just behind the Tartans with a 632, and Denison (655), Ohio Northern (657), Capital (666), and Wilmington (676) rounded out the field.
Blake Furgerson of John Carroll placed first individually, shooting a 137 overall (72–65) and beating out Transylvania’s Justin Tereshko (76–70). Tartans sophomore Michael Cheng tied for 10th individually, the highest a Carnegie Mellon individual placed, scoring a 152 (75–77). Right on his tail was his sophomore teammate Terence Einhorn, whose rounds of 76 and 77 allowed him to tie for 12th.
Also competing for the Tartans were seniors Brett Cannaday and Christopher Lee and junior Brent Driscoll. Cannaday tied for 26th with a 157 (77–80), while Lee tied for 38th with a 162 (80–82), and Driscoll tied for 51st with a 168 (80–88).
Despite losing two key players to graduation, the Tartans had a fair showing at the invitational, playing particularly well on the 12th hole, the hardest of the course. Cheng, Cannaday, and Einhorn all birdied the hole, with Cheng and Cannaday sinking difficult 30-foot putts.
It is early in the season for the team and they are looking forward to improving their results as the season progresses. “This tournament has allowed us to assess our performance and realize what we need to improve on in moving forward,” Cannaday said. “We are looking forward to the year and are hopeful that we will continue the success from last year.”
The Tartans will hit the links Sept. 20–21 as they compete at the annual Guy Kuhn Invitational at the Meadville Country Club in Meadville, Pa. The two-day event is hosted by Allegheny College.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team continued their rocky start to the season with a 1–4 defeat at the hands of Otterbein College on Saturday afternoon. 
The loss put the Tartans’ record for this season’s games played at 1–4.
Otterbein kicked off the scoring with a goal by Lindsey Rudibaugh during the eighth minute of regulation. 
Carnegie Mellon sophomore Brianna Magill tied the score at 1 for the Tartans seven minutes later with the first goal she has made as a Carnegie Mellon player. Magill headed the ball in off another header made by first-year Katie Davis.
The Cardinals were unrelenting, though, as they scored to take a 2–1 lead in the 16th minute on a goal by midfielder Carly Dent. Cardinals midfielder Becky Bowser then scored her first goal in almost two years, taking a cross from Adrienne Novak and depositing it past Tartans junior goalie Anya Rosen for a 3–1 Otterbein advantage.
First-year Tartans goalie Becca Gold entered the game for the second half and played solidly, making saves in the 52nd and 53rd minutes. Unfortunately for the Tartans, Gold let in a goal in the 58th minute on a penalty kick by the Cardinals’ Jenny Knox. The goal put the score at 4–1, where it stayed through the end of play, thanks in part to one more save by Gold in the 71st minute.
“Saturday was another frustrating loss,” Tartans senior defensive player and midfielder Casey Garth said. “We are in a real slump right now, but it is still early in the season. We have three more non-conference games coming up and we are going to have to sort some things out so we can go into conference play 4–4.”
The Tartans next play at home against Allegheny College on Wednesday, Sept. 23 at 7:30 p.m.

The volleyball team performed commendably at their own Carnegie Mellon Crossover tournament this past weekend, with junior Caroline Size contributing consistently in the Tartans’ 3–1 record over the two days of play. As an outside hitter, Size is able to use her height and athleticism to provide another positive force for her team during matches. Size has been top-ranked on the team in kills and digs the past two years and is making her way toward that goal again this season. As far as team goals go, Size and the rest of the Tartan volleyball squad are aiming for more consistency this season and are hoping for an NCAA tournament appearance.
Size is a business major who is now picking up an additional major in psychology, a decision she credits to social psychology, her favorite course so far. The diverse nature of Carnegie Mellon has rubbed off on Size over the past few years as well, as she noted that Taste of India is her favorite place to eat on campus, per the suggestion of one of her alumni teammates while she was a first-year. Size upholds that her favorite part about being in school at Carnegie Mellon are the people surrounding her school and sports lives, as she has fostered strong friendships with her peers on the volleyball court and in the classroom.
Although she may miss her family while they are back in Lewes, Del., Size profits from their willingness to travel to matches to support her and her teammates. While her father advocated trying volleyball while she was in middle school, Size was also involved in basketball and softball growing up. 
Her experience with these sports holds true as she participates in both, as well as in soccer, hockey, and kickball throughout the intramural seasons here. Having an interest in drawing during her free time, Size has proven that her talents are not limited to just athletics, although her success with sports is easily recognizable.

Hello, I’m Kevin Schultz, the director of strength and conditioning at Carnegie Mellon. This will be a bimonthly column that will feature informative and practical information regarding muscle and connective tissue fiber within your body. More specifically, I will be writing on topics regarding stretching, strength training, exercise selection, exercise prescription and planning, and cardiovascular training, as well as more general topics regarding nutrition as it relates to gains made from exercise. Without further ado, Static Stretching 101:
Most commonly, people participating in physical activity know one — and only one — way to stretch: statically. Although a lot has changed over the past 50 years regarding societal norms, technology, and stretching, static stretching still seems to be the choice for most physically active people. This is mostly true due to the ease of access to the equipment needed to perform static stretching: you.
To stretch before, during, or after exercise — that is the question. Actually, static stretching can be used at all three periods to improve flexibility, training adaptations, recovery time, and even injury prevention.
Pre-workout static stretching is typically performed on various muscle groups in order to warm up and prevent injury during a training session. Trainers recommend stretching large multi-joint muscle groups (e.g. quadriceps, hamstrings, chest, and back). Muscles should be placed under a constant, mildly discomforting stretch for 15–60 seconds depending on the number of times you will stretch each muscle. The magic number with all static stretching seems to be 60 seconds, during which you have the option of holding a stretch for one 60-second interval or up to four 15-second intervals.
During workout static stretching of the antagonist muscle — the muscle opposite the one being trained in the workout —has been shown to improve the strength of the agonist muscle — the one being trained — during a lifting session. For example, stretching out the quadriceps — the muscles on the front of the thighs — between sets of a hamstring — the back of the thigh — exercise increases the strength of the hamstrings. During an exercise set, two muscle groups are always working together to produce movement. The agonist muscle contracts to produce the movement while the opposing antagonist muscle relaxes to allow movement to happen. At times during movement, both muscles may contract at the same time, which can inhibit fluid motions.
Stretching the antagonist between sets decreases co-contraction to allow the agonist to produce slightly more force. Between each set, a muscle can be placed under stretch for 15–60 seconds depending on your goals and your programmed rest intervals.
Post-workout static stretching is probably the most widely known and performed type of stretching. Most people are aware of benefits that are attributed to static stretching, such as increased flexibility and increased range of motion (ROM), but there is one large benefit many people miss out on. During a normal training session, either strength or cardiovascular in nature, muscle fibers have a habit of shortening in length because they tend to be inflexible, and will wear down if not exercised — that is, if you don’t use it, you’ll lose it.
During a typical training session, only a very small ROM is used, causing the muscle fiber to shorten. If the natural length of the fibers is not properly restored, this shortening can lead to muscular dysfunction or injury.
Post-workout stretching is one way to decrease the chances of this happening. A short muscle cannot start to recover or rebuild until it reaches its natural resting muscle length. As with all static stretching, the goal is to stretch each trained or exercised muscle group for at least 60 seconds.
With all exercises, before you start, you should always consult your physician to gain medical clearance. If you have any specific questions, please feel free to e-mail me (schultzk@) and I will be more than happy to help you out.

The U.S. Open, the biggest tennis event in the United States, just finished this last week, but not without exciting drama. While tennis is usually not an entertaining spectator sport, this year’s tournament got fans talking. As a lifelong tennis player, one would expect that I would usually watch tournaments. To be completely honest, before the U.S. Open, I hadn’t watched a professional tennis match since the Australian Open finals. I, like many fans, get bored of watching Federer dominate the sport, and the level of women’s tennis is completely declining. Serena and Venus display some talent from time to time but never show consistent effort. However, the U.S. Open rekindled my interest in watching professional tennis by throwing in a Federer defeat, a Serena outburst, and a plethora of talented youngsters.
Throughout the two weeks of the Open, it appeared as though it was going to be an average tournament on the men’s side. After Nadal lost in the quarterfinals, I wasn’t even going to watch the semifinals or the finals. Federer only lost two sets on the way to the finals, and he was on the path to win, which I have seen enough times. I happened to be flipping through the channels when I caught the battle of Federer and Juan Martin Del Potro in the championship match. It was the end of the second set, a tiebreaker, so I kept watching. Though I’m normally a huge Federer fan, I must admit I was excited he was finally defeated in a grand slam. I think others felt that way as well. 
Tennis player Jeremy King said he was thrilled about the Del Potro victory and stated, “The Fed-DP match was an instant classic. It was a combination of one of the greatest matches of all time and a huge upset.” 
When someone dominates the competition for so long, it makes the sport stagnant and people lose interest. It is great publicity for tennis that someone besides Federer finally won a major. Way to rekindle some interest in tennis, Del Potro.
On the women’s side, there’s no doubt that tennis got more publicity than ever. American Melanie Oudin, only 17, captured the heart of fans everywhere. While the only hope for an American victory has been in the hands of Venus and Serena for the past several years, Oudin gave American tennis buffs everywhere a big shock. Before the Open, I had never heard of Oudin or her teenage media counterpart Caroline Wozniacki, currently 19. The two teenage girls had laid low in the publicity scene but were working on their huge tennis games. Oudin, who had only made it past the first round in one prior major, made it to the semifinals before losing to Wozniacki. The two could no longer lie low in the publicity scene, as Oudin was being praised for her young age and shocking performance while Wozniacki was commended for her incredible talent and charming smile. I was completely shocked to imagine myself at 17 standing in front of that crowd in New York. I asked myself, what is it about tennis that lets such young women dominate the field? I came to the conclusion that two things make women better fit for professional tennis. One is the starting age. Tennis players often start playing tennis before the age of 10, making their chance for burnout extremely high. Most women are also in the best physical shape of their life in their teenage years to their 20s. The rigorous demand of singles wears greatly on bodies, especially women. So while it is relatively shocking to see teenagers compete in such high-profile events, tennis players will keep turning professional about this age in order to keep the level of the game at its peak.
The teenage attention won’t be what is remembered about the women’s U.S. Open in 2009, though. Serena was lacking attention throughout the Open. Since she wasn’t going to eliminate the teenage phenoms, she caught her publicity by throwing a temper tantrum. She also caught a $10,000 fine. In case you missed it, Serena swore violently at a lineswoman the point before match point after she was called for a foot fault. After scurrying nervously to the head line-judge chair, the lineswoman reported Serena’s outburst, getting Serena a point penalty on match point. Serena lost the match and was furious. YouTube videos surfaced of her using the f-word and talking about what she would do to the lineswoman with the little fuzzy tennis ball. As a tennis player, I can imagine the frustration Serena had at this point, but honestly, there’s no excuse for acting that way on the court. Tennis in particular is supposed to be a competition of sportsmanship and class. Her outbursts are not uncommon, but this one showed Serena at a record low. She should have been suspended for some time. If we want to keep the sport of tennis honorable, there need to be harsher punishments for outbursts like this.
Overall, the excitement of tennis was at a record high. The athletes needed to supply some intriguing reasons to keep watching, and they sure did what they needed to do to catch my attention.

Sight is the predominant sense in the perception of the world. At the early age of 6, it has already developed into the most dominant of the five senses. But what if we slowly lost our ability to see? Our lifestyle would change drastically; anyone who has tried walking around with closed eyes would understand. Although we would probably become accustomed to a lack of vision, it would still complicate many daily tasks and leave us limited in our activities.
Diseases of the eyes are numerous and have many causes; for example, people with diabetes may develop diabetic retinopathy in which blood vessels in their retina are damaged. This may cause blood to leak into the eye, blurring and blotting vision, causing a condition known as macular edema. Fortunately, we live in an age of expanding knowledge and collaboration in robotics, medicine, and surgery. It is because of these diseases that many of today’s leading researchers and robotics scientists are motivated by robotic surgery. One such scientist is Brian Becker, a current Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon working in the field of robotic surgery. Becker is currently working on the Micron project under his adviser, Cameron Riviere. 
Micron, designed by staff engineer Robert MacLachlan, is a handheld, pen-shaped device used in robotic eye surgery that is planned for use with retinal surgery therapy. 
While a person holds it like a pen, it has a small tip that can move in three dimensions. Using stabilization software, the device can minimize unwanted hand movements, or tremor, caused by natural hand unsteadiness.
“Everybody has a little bit of tremor in their hands,” Becker said. “However, microsurgeons often deal with structures that are as tiny as the diameter of a human hair or even smaller. A system such as Micron compensates for tremor to increase the accuracy of surgical movements.”
Micron will be used in laser photocoagulation, which is a process in which heat from a laser is used to seal blood vessels that may be leaking or abnormal. The treatment may completely seal blood vessels on the retina, or it may slow the growth of new abnormal blood vessels. Thus, Micron will be able to treat diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. Micron is attached to sensory equipment that will be used in the application of laser burns. As Becker explained, there are motors between the handle grip and the end tip, and its position will be tracked with high-speed optical tracking from stereo cameras mounted on a microscope. Micron will thus be able to track its own movements so as to apply the burn to the correct place, correct for hand tremor, and stabilize the instrument. Becker explains the benefits of such an advanced technology: “The Micron concept can be used to place laser burns accurately, inject medicine into veins, avoid accidentally bumping into delicate tissue, and increase precision of operations by scaling down movement within the workspace. The surgeon exerts macro control while Micron aids in the micro movements.”
Minimizing tremor has always been desired during medical procedures. Micron differs from other devices because it is cheaper, and leaves the surgeon in full macro control of the device. Other devices developed require more extensive training, are less intuitive, and cost over a hundred times more. Tests have already been performed with Micron, using a seven-by-seven grid of squares 650 microns apart (about a quarter of a penny in size), and Micron was noticeably faster and more accurate than the manual process. 
“Most of our existing experiments have centered around simple tasks such as pointing, tracing, and other basic movements used in surgery. In these tasks we have shown roughly 20 percent improvement in accuracy,” Becker said. In the future, the group plans to test Micron on real animal eyes.
Micron is still in its developmental stages, but it has a bright future. Becker, who is researching the control of Micron in useful ways, would like to expand the usefulness of the instrument. Currently, Micron is adept at accuracy in a small area; Becker wants to expand its range of motion to handle larger tasks, such as over a thousand accurate laser burns and a greater speed of operation. He hopes to achieve other goals for Micron, including the ability to inject medicine into tiny retinal veins, and to expand its scope into more than just retinal surgical procedures. Micron was developed to benefit medical science. Becker revealed his optimistic outlook on the device’s future, saying, “It is supposed to be as interchangeable as possible with existing equipment and procedures, yet superior in existing approaches by providing increased accuracy to enable procedures that are today considered impossible.”

While many might complain about the amount of money spent for something as trivial as a haircut, the hair stylist might actually be paying more. Stylists are at high risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome due to repetitive hand motion accompanied by the high tension between the nerves of their fingers from using the scissors.  However, local Oakland barber Enrico Bellisario has come up with an invention that could help alleviate symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. 
Bellisario, the owner of Enrico’s Haircutting for Men, located on Fifth Avenue, once suffered severely from carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a medical condition in which the median nerve that runs from the forearm into the hand becomes pressed or squeezed at the wrist. One of the most vital functions of the median nerve is to control the impulses to small muscles in the hand that enable the fingers and thumb to move freely. 
The carpal tunnel is the narrow channel of ligament and bones at the base of the hand that houses the median nerve. CTS often leads to a sensations of tingling, pricking, numbness, and muscle weakness in the hand. Most people who have this syndrome usually experience the symptoms gradually over time. 
Early stages of CTS include frequent burning, tingling, and numbness in the palm and specific fingers, such as the thumb and index finger. 
These symptoms usually appear during the night, since many people tend to bend their wrists when they sleep, which applies even more pressure to the carpal tunnel. People diagnosed with this syndrome may also have the urge to “shake out” their hands or wrists.  
In later stages of CTS, the symptoms may occur during both the day and night. In addition, decreased grip strength results in difficulty grabbing things. Therefore, patients might notice increased incidents of dropping objects.
Bellisario noticed that CTS was a major hindrance for all hairstylists, including himself. In the past, cutting people’s hair using the ordinary scissor-comb switching method would cause extreme tension in his hands. 
It was then that he came up with an invention that combined the scissor and the comb. After searching for three years, he finally found a Taiwanese manufacturer who could carry out his idea by using injection molding to attach the comb teeth to the scissors. 
According to an article in the*Pittsburgh Post-Gazette*, his invention won a silver medal in the personal care product category at the InventHelp’s INPEX inventors’ show in June 2008, trailing only the Diamond Shades Long-Lasting Fragrant Face Mask by a Taiwanese inventor. Shearfuzion, the name of the final product, allows Bellisario to save an average of five minutes on each customer. 
Using Shearfuzion, he stated, “There is no switching. You see, in the past, you comb, switch hands, and then cut. Now, you comb and then cut.” Also, his invention eases strain in the wrist and palm. “I was able to start cutting people’s hair again in a mere few days after getting better from my CTS syndromes. Usually it takes weeks to do that,” he said.
Shearfuzion is not only for professional stylists; it was designed to be easy for everyone to use. 
“I know a lot of students who like to trim their hair from time to time, not to mention wives who love to cut their husbands’ hair,” Bellisario said. “Now they don’t have to worry about messing up their hair by cutting it too deep. And they can save huge time and money from going to a haircut place just to get a little trim for their date or interviews!” 
More information about Shearfuzion can be found online at www.shearfuzion.com.

Modern hard disk drives last a few years before they have to be discarded — they are plagued by mechanical failures that can occur anywhere between two and six years into their lives. Solid state drives offer some consolation in that the amount of time they can store data is approximately 2400 years if handled carefully, according to a paper published by Imation Corp. However, for those among us who would need to store data for over a billion years, we would probably have to resort to nanoparticle-based non-volatile memory.
Of the many nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes have attracted the most attention, and not without cause. Carbon nanotubes are tubes made of interconnected carbon atoms. 
They may be single-walled, made of a single layer of carbon atoms, or they could be multi-walled, with multiple layers forming the tube. These nanotubes possess many properties that set them apart from most materials on the nano, micro, and macro scales. 
Carbon nanotubes are the strongest and stiffest materials known today, and certain forms of these nanotubes are capable of conducting electricity. It is mainly on account of these two properties that carbon nanotubes are used in nanoparticle-based memory.
Digital data is stored — and processed — in binary digits, known as bits. These bits can be thought of as the states of a switch; they can be “on” or “off.” In nanoparticle-based memory, the basic idea is to shuttle a nanoparticle (made of a metal like silver or iron) between the two ends of a multi-walled carbon nanotube. Usually, one end of the tube is considered to be at a certain logic level zero while the other end is the logic level one. The position of the shuttle within the nanotube, therefore, simulates the same states of “on” and “off,” and if the shuttle position can be frozen, the system will function as non-volatile memory. Non-volatile memory is capable of storing data even when the power supply is removed.
“Writing” data into this sort of memory is to simply position the shuttle in one of the different predefined regions. Particle motion within the nanotube is brought about by flowing a current through the device. The direction of motion can be reversed by reversing the direction of supplied current. 
The speed of the particle as it travels along the tube is determined by the magnitude of the voltage applied across the ends of the tube. It follows that by reducing the supplied current to zero, the position of the shuttle can be fixed at some point within the tube.
The solid state physics group at the University of California at Berkeley, led by Alex Zettl, noticed that the electrical resistance offered by the nanotubes varies with the position of the particle, making it possible to locate the particle — with reasonable accuracy — by simply measuring the resistance along the tube. This is how the written data is then “read.”
The nanotubes are sealed at both ends with electrodes, and these electrodes provide the shuttle with the current necessary for shuttle motion or positioning.
At the nano scale, friction is negligible and the friction offered by the nanotube to the shuttle will be so trivial that no mechanical damage will be caused during particle movement. 
Unlike hard disk drives, the mechanical components in this memory will not, in theory, fail. Furthermore, this lack of friction allows for an unlimited number of write/rewrite processes, unlike solid state drives that become unreliable after a certain number of write processes.
Zettl’s group has shown that data can be stored for longer than a billion years using this method of storage. 
The nanotubes are protected, as they are hermetically sealed by the two electrodes, and this prevents contamination and possible loss of data. 
They also claim that compared to modern data storage systems, more data can be stored per area of storage material used. 
While today’s state-of-the-art hard disk drives can store approximately 200 gigabits (200 billion bits) per square inch, it is believed that this proposed method can increase data densities to around 1000 gigabits per square inch.
So far, only small numbers of such carbon nanotubes have been assembled in order to test these data storage capabilities. These numbers have not been large enough to warrant mass production. 
However, they do prove that this model works, and can be implemented with good results. It could well be quite a few years before this goes into production, quite possibly more than a decade before this system is perfected. Until then, we will have to wait, and while doing so, back up our digital data on solid state drives.

In the past few decades, rapid advances in technology have led to corresponding advances in medicine, which have then resulted in exponentially better treatment for people with diseases that had earlier been a certain death sentence.
One such disease is Cystic Fibrosis (CF); only a little more than 50 years ago, this diagnosis, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation’s website, was a fatal sentence for the child who was diagnosed before he or she even reached elementary school. Now the median age of a person with CF is more than 37 years, a clear improvement over only a half century ago. CF is an inherited respiratory disease that results in thick, sticky mucus secretions in the respiratory and digestive tracts and the reproductive system and causes an increase in the amount of salt in sweat. 
These symptoms are due to a defective gene that alters a protein that controls the normal movement of sodium chloride, or table salt, into and out of the cells. This gene is recessive, which means that a child must inherit it from both their mother and father in order to have CF; if they receive only one copy of the gene, they will not develop the disease, but there will be the possibility that they pass the gene on to their own child.
The main characteristic of CF is the thick secretions that are produced. In healthy people, the cells that produce mucus, sweat, saliva, and digestive juices produce thin, slippery secretions that act as lubricants. For people with CF, however, the thicker secretions actually plug up tubes in the pancreas and lungs, which results in frequent respiratory infections. In addition, the secretions stop the body from absorbing important vitamins by blocking pancreatic enzymes that aid in the digestion of fats and proteins.
Common respiratory infections experienced by patients with CF are bronchitis, pneumonia, and chronic sinusitis; asthma can also result. The respiratory infections occur so often for people with CF because the thick mucus that is secreted blocks the airways, and is also the perfect breeding ground for the bacteria that cause these infections.  In addition to respiratory infections, respiratory failure can also result, as can a collapsed lung. With a collapsed lung, a small hole forms in the lung’s outer layer which leads to air leaking into the chest cavity. It is ultimately respiratory problems that prove fatal for those with CF. 
Though respiratory issues are common for CF patients, they are not the only symptoms of the disease. The thick secretions that block the airways and lead to respiratory infections also block the ducts of the pancreas, which stops enzymes that digest fat and proteins from reaching the stomach. This keeps the body from absorbing vitamins A, D, E, and K, resulting in severe nutritional deficiencies. 
People with CF also often develop cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, because the pancreas controls the level of blood sugar and the ducts of the pancreas are often covered. The bile duct, which takes bile from the liver and gallbladder to the small intestine, can also be blocked by the secretions, leading to liver problems such as cirrhosis.
Cystic fibrosis can also cause reproductive problems in both men and women, though treatment options are available for both that can make it possible for some people to have children. As explained on MayoClinic.com, a number of treatments exist to help patients with CF live with the disease, though there is currently no cure. 
Antibiotics are used to treat the bacteria that cause the respiratory infections. Mucus thinning drugs can also help, because the thinner mucus is easier to cough up. Bronchodilators are also used; medicines such as albuterol help to open the bronchial tubes and clear the thick secretions. 
Oral enzymes are often taken to help patients maintain weight, as people with CF often need more calories than healthy people do. For those with persistent, severe, and life-threatening respiratory problems, a lung transplant may be suggested, though due to the serious risks that accompany this procedure, it is often a last option. 
Though no cure exists for CF presently, the genetic mutation that causes the disease has been identified, and scientists have been looking for ways to put copies of the healthy gene into the patient’s respiratory tract; clinical trials are being done to test the reliability and effectiveness of using modified viruses, fat capsules, and synthetic vectors. In addition, testing has been developed to check if a person is a carrier of the CF gene.

Heart-lung machine  helps H1N1 patients 
According to a study conducted in England, running blood through a heart-lung machine may be more helpful for treating swine flu patients than putting them on a ventilator. The method of delivering oxygen to blood through microfibers, a process called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, can be used to care for swine flu patients. 
Not putting patients on a ventilator gives their lungs a chance to rest, since more air is not being forced into them. The researchers involved in the study believe that the new method would be especially helpful for young flu patients with previously healthy lungs.

Bacteria found on showerheads
A new study says that potentially disease-causing germs can get trapped in showerheads and grow into biofilm or coats of slime that deliver a bacteria blast along with hot water. 
Levels of these bacteria are more than 100-fold higher than levels found in the pre-shower water, according to the researchers, who analyzed the germs in the biofilm of 45 showerheads from nine U.S. cities.
Since most of the germs are harmless, however, this finding does not pose a threat to healthy people with functioning immune systems. 
Nonetheless, experts recommend changing the showerhead once a year or more frequently, like they do in hospitals, to prevent mineral deposits and biofilm.

Standards for robotic surgery to be set
Increasing numbers of surgeons are using high-tech robotic equipment to operate on patients with prostate cancer and other conditions, but some medical authorities worry about inadequate training for using this new equipment. 
Although the rate of failure of robot-assisted surgeries is similar to that of traditional surgeries, such procedures can be more risky if inexperienced surgeons work with the robots. 
Currently, there is no system to test a surgeon’s competency with robots, and surgeons cannot practice on simulators before working with live patients.
The issue of standards will be addressed at next month’s World Congress of Endourology in Munich. The American Urology Association will consider the recommendations.

Swine flu vaccine to be given as a spray
The swine flu vaccine might first be administered as a nasal spray, said Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials. The nasal spray, called FluMist, is is approved only for healthy people ages 2 to 49 years. 
It is not recommended for some of the people who are most in danger of severe swine flu complications. These include pregnant women, children younger than 2, and people with asthma and other chronic respiratory diseases. 
The nasal spray vaccine is made from a live yet weakened strain of the swine flu virus, in contrast to the normal shot vaccines, which are made from the killed flu virus.

Companies work on 3-D television
Four companies — Sony, Panasonic, Mitsubishi, and JVC — have reported that they are currently working on making 3-D television available in the home, expected for release in 2010.
The system works by presenting different images to the right and left eye. The brain then combines these two together to produce a 3-D image. 
Although many are excited about this new technology, some are worried about the large cost accompanying the project and the viewers’ inability to enjoy the shows as they were before. Movie production industries, furthermore, must adapt new technologies to project the 3-D images.

Researchers use algae as oil source
A team of researchers from India are looking into using a type of single-celled algae, called diatoms, to produce biofuel. These genetically engineered diatoms contain droplets of oil inside them and consume them when food sources are scarce. Since the diatoms produce oil on exposure to sunlight, the researchers have proposed building a solar panel consisting of just diatoms that can be used to make this oil. 
The substance makes up nearly a quarter of the algae’s mass.
Some believe more fossil fuel resources must be directed toward the project, while others assert that sunlight and cheap materials make the project a big possibility.

Volkswagen unveils new hybrid car
The L1, a diesel hybrid car designed by Volkswagen, made its debut at a Frankfurt auto show last Wednesday. Weighing 900 pounds and getting 170 miles per gallon, the car is designed “to look and be built to consume as little energy as possible,” say the engineers behind the L1.
The fuel tank holds 1.7 gallons, and the sleek carbon fiber exterior body that is similar to Formula 1 and aerospace technologies only adds to the versatility.
When asked about the future of the L1, the company claimed that mass production of the car could start by 2013. However, a limited number of models are scheduled to be released next year.

Arctic melting slower than believed
Scientists at the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) have determined that the annual summer melting of the Arctic Sea ice has not been as dramatic as it has been in the past.
The most likely cause for the reduction was the dispersion of ice by arctic winds and globally cooler temperatures. NSIDC scientist Walt Meier states that the latter was due to “cloudier conditions and low pressure zones in late summer.”
Despite the new data, scientists maintain that the long-term trend has continued to indicate a rise in temperatures. Especially alarming is the presence of thin new ice lying on top of the older, thicker ice.

Not everyone is aware that a little piece of Carnegie Mellon is sitting on most of the working world’s desk at this very moment, and it comes in the form of a coffee cup. The logo of Starbucks is designed by Carnegie Mellon alumnus Terry Heckler, who graduated in the class of 1964 with a major in art. He is also the creator of the brand logos for JanSport, New Balance, and the Qdoba restaurant chain.
Carnegie Mellon alumni have made numerous contributions in the realms of design, computers, film, and beyond — and continue to make an impact as we speak — we just don’t always hear about it. The new virtual “Brag Book” cmu.edu/brag compiles accomplishments of everything Carnegie Mellon, all in one place, and makes bragging about the university as easy as the click of a mouse. Although most of the alumni featured on the page have relocated elsewhere in the world, I caught up with Luis von Ahn and Kenneth Koedinger, both of whom hold doctorates from Carnegie Mellon and teach on campus.
Von Ahn completed his dissertation at Carnegie Mellon in 2005 and has been named one of the “50 Best Brains in Science” by Discover Magazine and one of Popular Science magazine’s “Brilliant 10.” He is credited for developing CAPTCHAs (Completely Automatic Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart), as well as GWAPs (Games With A Purpose). CAPTCHAs are the squiggly letters one must decipher in order to access a website so that the webpage is able to distinguish a human from a computer, a test that has helped sites like Ticketmaster.com prevent scalpers from purchasing tickets in bulk and reselling them at a higher price.
It was on a flight that von Ahn first came up with the idea of a GWAP. As everyone in his row sat idly solving a crossword puzzle, von Ahn remembers thinking, “Wouldn’t it be more useful to use this time for something else?” The notion of playing a game that was purposeful — such as one that would, like “Google Image Labeler,” help search engines better identify images — was born. Two players, unable to communicate, must choose a word to describe a picture and continue playing until both agree upon a single descriptive noun in order to win points. The game can be played at images.google.com/imagelabeler.
Koedinger, a professor within the Human Computer Interaction Institute and the director of the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center, develops “cognitive tutoring” models that identify why and how students who are able to learn quickly are able to do so. These computer programs are distributed and used by teachers nationwide in order to help those students falling behind in science, math, or language make a quick turnaround in their studies when a human tutor is not readily available. Carnegie Learning, Inc. has aided over 2600 schools and 500,000 students across the nation.
Koedinger received a Ph.D. in cognitive psychology from Carnegie Mellon and remembers feeling “like a kid in a candy store” upon realizing that the professors whose articles he had read and cited while a student at the University of Wisconsin were all on the same campus here at Carnegie Mellon. Koedinger notes that Carnegie Learning, Inc., which spans psychology, computer science, and communications, was successfully launched in our university’s climate of interdisciplinary studies.
H&SS graduate and co-author of Randy Pausch’s The Last Lecture, Jeffrey Zaslow is a writer for the Wall Street Journal’s column “Moving On.” Zaslow, who majored in creative writing, wrote for the Chicago Sun-Times after winning a spot in a competition among 12,000 journalists.
And anyone who caught this summer’s Star Trek would have seen a Tartan on the big screen in the role of Spock. Zachary Quinto, who is also a lead in the hit TV drama Heroes, is a Pittsburgh native and graduated from the School of Drama in 1999. Also hailing from the School of Drama is Stephen Shwartz, the person who wrote the music for the Academy Award-winning Disney movie Enchanted and also worked on the music for the film Pocahontas and the Broadway musical Wicked. His first musical, Pippin!, was performed by student theater group Scotch’n’Soda before becoming a hit on the Great White Way.
Other notable alumni include one of the co-founders of Juicy Couture, Gela Nash-Taylor, who graduated with a major in acting from the School of Drama in 1978. She started the now internationally known brand in 1997 with business partner Pam Skaist-Levy and just $200 of their own money. The line originated as maternity jeans and grew into an international success that projects sales at $200 million this year. The Juicy Couture sweat suit is also the only contemporary outfit featured within the permanent fashion exhibit at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, making the talent of a Carnegie Mellon graduate the representation for an entire generation of clothing.
The brag book is not limited to alumni but also includes achievements on campus, such as the fact that Carnegie Mellon was the first university to be truly “connected,” or wireless. Stever House, built in 2003, is the first all-green dormitory to be included on a United States college campus. Carnegie Mellon is the only university to house Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Intel under one roof within the “Collaborative Innovation Center.” Four years pass quickly, but a connection to Carnegie Mellon lasts a lifetime. 
Have a brag of your own? Don’t be shy and let it be known at cmu.edu/brag/submit.

How many cups of coffee do you drink per semester?
Coffee is a significant part of not only our lives, but also the lives of Nicaraguans — in a very different way, of course. We went on a unique study abroad experience with our floor-mates as a part of the Global Studies Program during the spring break of our first year. Instead of the coffee bean traveling to us, we got to travel to the coffee bean, and since we had the time of our lives there, we want to give you a taste of the flavor of Nicaragua.
Coffee is one of the prime exports of and the means of livelihood in Nicaragua. We not only witnessed this, but also immersed ourselves in the Nicaraguan way of life for a few days. Miraflor is a small village in the north of Nicaragua where we stayed with local families, learning all about their lives and about coffee, which is their life.
The houses in Miraflor were very humble, with a kitchen, a living room, and a guest room. There was no sewage system. To us, this meant that we had to walk for about a hundred meters before we could use the facilities. During the day, this wasn’t too bad — but imagine taking the walk when it is pitch black outside. Yes, it was pitch black, because electricity isn’t supplied to this community. They charged the one light in the house using solar power during the day, and because our hosts were exceedingly hospitable, this light was mounted in the guest rooms during our stay.
That wasn’t the only exception they made for us. There’s nothing like a good meal at the end of a hard day’s work, and our meals in Miraflor were no exception. Naturally, due to their limited means, their daily meals weren’t very elaborate. And although we didn’t work half as hard as our host parents did, we did get a delicious reward for it. Our host mom prepared some fresh tortillas, soup, some plantains, dessert, and of course gallo pinto. Gallo pinto is the staple food of Nicaragua and is a delectable, yet simple, dish of rice and beans. We weren’t tired of it even after eating it for every meal for more than a week.
What touched us most were the people of Nicaragua. Their spirit was inspiring. They were always eager to learn about new things, to cooperate and help each other, and they had a very strong sense of community.
During one of our dinners, our host dad told us that he likes to attend the training sessions that the agricultural university, located four to five hours of travel away, organizes so that he can learn new practices like vermi-compost, the use of solar panels, etc., and does so whenever he can. He proudly gave us a tour of his backyard, explaining in detail how he applies these newly learned organic and eco-friendly practices. Also, even though he and his wife were illiterate and they needed more hands for farm work, they sent all their children to school and college. Now, their children not only have jobs, but also travel internationally. Eventually, our host parents learned to read and write Spanish from their own children. This attitude is rare to come by and impossible to forget.
Over the course of the week, we learned about how coffee is grown and how it is dried, processed, and packaged. We toured the Las Segovias Coffee Mill of PRODECOOP, a cooperative that helps the farmers of Miraflor sell their coffee. This is where we participated in a coffee-cupping session, in which coffee was tasted and smelled for richness, quality, and consistency.
Coffee-cupping is a very specific procedure in which there are three samples of each coffee. More than 10 such different coffees are graded at one time. First one smells all the samples, then adds some hot water to them, carefully sucking it to splash it at the back of the mouth for a burst of taste before spitting it out. What is remarkable is that the professionals grade about 300 different coffees per day — and we thought we drank a lot of coffee. 
Cooperatives seem to be commonplace in this country, which relatively recently ended a war. We observed that they always try to work together to help themselves, each other, and the community as a whole. Actually, that is how the coffee farmers can afford to even have their own farmland. Every individual farmer in a cooperative owns a small piece of land. However, in order to be certified as organic or fair and free trade zones, they need to have a minimum area of land, which an individual farmer cannot afford. Hence, they register it under one cooperative and work on each other’s lands to get maximum yield for the cooperative. In Nicaragua, we witnessed that unity is strength.
Our trip to Nicaragua helped us reach out to a bigger world, but it also brought us closer to each other. Now every cup of coffee reminds me of our trip to Nicaragua, about what we learned and experienced there.
Every coffee bean has a story to tell, if you are willing to taste it.

Everyone witnessed the events that occurred at the MTV Video Music Awards. We saw Beyonce’s one-in-a million performance, Pink swinging in midair, and the talk of the town: Kanye West taking the microphone from Taylor Swift. But in all of this madness, did anyone notice that the VMAs are hardly even about music anymore?
Last year, Britney Spears won just about a thousand awards for her recently released song “Piece of Me,” but some have said that she may have received those awards because MTV felt bad for her and wanted to encourage her re-entry into the music world. It seems like just about all of the female nominees won an award in each category, just to be fair. People seem to come to the VMAs not to perform, but for a performance. What I mean is that the VMAs are the perfect opportunity for people like Kanye West and Lil’ Mama to come out and do something outrageous that will be talked about in the media and remembered for the next year.
Senior economics major Brianna Agyemang agrees and discusses how MTV plays fewer videos now than they used to. “I thought MTV stood for Music Television. Maybe I misinterpreted the meaning,” she said. “Awards aren’t given for how good the music is, but I feel like they give awards to people so the fans don’t get upset, regardless of what the best video may have been. I’m talking about the categories that fans don’t vote for. Lady Gaga and Beyonce both had videos that were never done before and Taylor Swift had ... a video that we have seen before. High school girl chases high school boy. Really? Are you serious right now?”
CD releases are coming out every week, and many of these are artists we haven’t heard from in a long time, like Whitney Houston, and some are artists we hear from every day. But no matter the case, the spotlight always seems to be taken by someone who does something, either planned or spontaneous, that is aimed at gaining attention. Lady Gaga had a very interesting performance of her hit “Paparazzi,” where she bled and then was hoisted above her backup dancers. Then, later in the show, she appeared in a red outfit that covered her face and raised above her head something that resembled a crown. Now really, for what other reason would anyone wear an outfit like that if not to gain the paparazzi’s attention?
Music has changed in so many ways. It is hardly about the content of your song or the creativity of your video. Nowadays, it seems that music is all about popularity and 
how many fans have been generated over the year, allowing just a few artists to take over the industry. Maybe we can look forward to more next year as each generation brings something new along with it.
Music is heard everywhere in the world today, and so many people can make music. Music is in the footsteps we make, the sound of the car engine revving, and even the shower turning on. Even though music is everywhere, it is still difficult to get quality sounds and honest music from those who claim to be artists. Maybe the term “entertainer” has taken on a more literal meaning as artists now are all about entertaining by any means necessary. They keep their fans encompassed in their daily lives by performing the most ridiculous stunts. So, let’s wait until next year to see what happens.

The international hit Stomp premiered at the Benedum Center in downtown Pittsburgh last Tuesday. The show has just entered its 16th season off Broadway, making it one of the longest-running international productions to date.
Although the show lacked any actual dialogue, it was anything but silent. In an enthralling combination of dance, percussion, and high energy, the performers of Stomp used modern day garbage as their instruments, dancing to the beat of trash cans and kitchen pans. Through active audience participation and a comical unspoken script, attendees were left to interpret and conclude their own plotlines.
From its humble beginnings as a street performance in the U.K., Stomp has seen unparalleled success. The show has debuted in 36 countries worldwide, selling out hundreds of theaters and receiving several international awards. With shows in New York’s Orpheum Theater and London’s Ambassador Theater, along with two tours actively traveling through both Europe and the United States, Stomp has become a recognizable and respected title in the performance world.
However, Stomp veterans shouldn’t be fooled by the familiar name. The show’s creators, Steve McNicholas and Luke Creswell, have reworked the choreography and composition of the show especially for this year’s U.S. tour. “The tour changes are great — they keep the audience guessing,” said Elec Simon, one of the eight traveling troupe performers. “You may think you know what we’re going to do next, but you have no idea.” With new full-scale routines using tractor tire inner tubes and recycled paint cans, audiences witness the greatest Stomp routine changes since the late 1990s.
Due to popular demand, some components of the show have remained unchanged. Brooms, bungee cords, and wooden poles are established signatory props in the show’s choreography.
“My favorite scene of the show is ‘Poles,’” said Simon. “We come out with these giant sticks and surround this imaginary campfire, like we’re all warriors about to fight each other. It’s our most intense piece, I think. We make this symphony of noise with just our poles, our hands, and our feet.” Besides being experienced dancers, every member of the Stomp cast is also a well-trained musician. Their pieces involve complicated time signatures and unique intervals that make the show both intricate and exciting.
“Every second of the show was entertaining,” said Candace Spellmeyer, an undecided first-year CIT student. “The performers are more like a drill team. The songs are so complicated and every player is in perfect sync.”
As far as productions go, Stomp is highly recommended. The show is a flawlessly renewed representation of rhythm and energy in an unconventional presentation, and audiences will be consistently entertained throughout the 90-minute performance. This junkyard landmark has truly been recycled.
The show plays six days a week year round at the Orpheum Theater in New York City. Tickets can be purchased at www.stomponline.com.

This past week, alternative rock band Our Lady Peace (OLP) performed at the Carnegie Library of Homestead Music Hall in Munhall, Pa. in front of a modest, yet die-hard, group of fans.
The band is one of the most popular Canadian rock bands of the last couple of decades, one that has sold over 5 million albums worldwide and retains a medium-to-large cult following wherever they travel. In addition, they hold the distinction of owning the most number of awards, a grand total of 10, given out in the history of the MuchMusic Video Awards (Canada’s version of the Grammy or MTV awards).
OLP burst onto the scene in 1994 with their debut album Naveed. Since then, they have released six albums including their most recent, Burn Burn, which they are currently promoting on tour throughout the United States. What’s special about this album is that it is the second one that follows what has been called a radical departure from their distinctive sound, an overall new style change for the band that began in 2001 with their album Gravity. In particular, lead vocalist Raine Maida’s singing during the band’s early years was called erratic and unrivaled by various reviewers, giving songs an unreal and almost fantasy-esque feel to them. More recently, Maida has strayed from his trademark type of singing; some would call it more mainstream.
Opening the night were the bands Paper Tongues and Inward Eye, and both showed off solid sets. Eye’s punkish rock attitude was a great warmup for OLP’s more surreal rocking persona. Just after 9:30 p.m., Raine Maida, Jeremy Taggart, Duncan Coutts, and Steve Mazur took the stage with thunderous applause from the crowd and jumped right into their new songs from Burn Burn. But it was clear that the band had not forgotten what got them to where they are today; a third of their set had songs that were eight or more years old, including smash hits “Clumsy” and “Superman’s Dead.”
One notable moment involved an audience member being invited on stage to sing the lyrics to “Starseed.” The member had attended OLP’s Cleveland, Ohio performance three weeks ago, had jumped on stage and danced there, and then proceeded to follow OLP to Pittsburgh. Maida made light of the fact that he never would have guessed his first duet would be with another man. A laugh came when Maida dedicated a song to “that asshole Kanye West.”
My personal favorite part of the show came when OLP performed “Is Anybody Home?” and Maida allowed the crowd to sing the chorus by themselves, which we did beautifully, according to the man himself. The sound itself was chilling, and just knowing that there were so many die-hard fans in the same place was a great feeling.
Over the course of the show, OLP performed a relatively equal mix of material from Burn Burn and popular hits from older albums, a good decision considering OLP hasn’t performed in Pittsburgh in years. It was a wonderful trip down memory lane, hearing some old favorites jumbled in with everything OLP’s been working on for the past four years. Maida’s vocal style is different now, but it definitely did not make for a boring or weak show. OLP has more than enough ability and talent to change for the better, and, at least in the eyes of the hundreds of people who sang along to nearly everything OLP put forth last Tuesday, they have already shown they can.
The next closest concert will be in Columbus, Ohio on Oct. 29. For more information visit their website at www.ourladypeace.net.

While it might seem that Julia Child’s cookbooks are among the last things that anyone would expect to change lives or revolutionize self-perception, Julie and Julia is a movie based on such a premise. The movie does contain delicious entrees and desserts and is put together well, with scenes ranging from a flat above a pizza shop in New York City to the sprawling roads of Paris. Initially, some may write the film off as a chick flick, but Julie and Julia is more than a film for fans of the famous chef.
The plot, of course, revolves around food. The film follows the storylines of two different women in two different times: Julia Child (Meryl Streep), when she first arrives in Paris with her husband in the early 1950s, and Julie Powell (Amy Adams), when she moves into a flat just over a pizza parlor in the Big Apple in 2003. Both women, old and young, struggle to find their places in their new worlds: Julia tries her hand at making hats and fails, and Julie watches as all her friends prosper while she is featured in one of their articles as one of those thirty-somethings that “never made it.” Still, both women persevere and eventually find their niche: Julia with her cooking and Julie with her writing. However, it’s hardly easy from there. Julia must contend against male chefs at the Cordon Bleu in her efforts to prove herself worthy of taking the class, and Julie has to split her time between cooking every recipe in Julia’s cookbook to record on her blog and spending time with her husband.
The scene changes between France and America aren’t jarring, though during some down times of the film, the viewer might wish that the transitions happened sooner. The film is carried more by its characters than its effects, but these characters’ relationships and the strains on them are what make watching Julie and Julia so entertaining. The stress on Julie’s husband as her Internet fame grows slowly escalates through the film, to the point where he gets so tired of being edged out of his marriage that he leaves. Likewise, Julia has difficulty coping both with the fact that she and her husband, Paul, must leave Paris and that they will never be able to have a child of their own.
Though the primary focus is on the food and relationships, the movie does lead the viewer to wonder about how today’s world is different from that of the past. Relations between Julie and her husband suffer when Julie starts to put her project before her marriage, a set of priorities alien to Julia’s world. At the same time, when Paul is interrogated about his connections to communism without being allowed to sleep, the audience gets a sense of just how different the world has become.
That is not to stay that Julie and Julia doesn’t have its comical moments. When Julie realizes what exactly goes into the preparation of a lobster, she can hardly believe the task that is set before her. Still, she keeps going. Sometimes the results aren’t always for the best, and wished-for events fail to come to fruition more than once.
Perhaps most intriguing about the film is that, though the expectation viewers have is for everything to work out and end happily, it rarely does. Cooking, like life, has its high points and its failures, ranging from missed opportunities to burnt stews. Even at the film’s conclusion, though the audience is sure that a certain event must happen and that a certain someone must approve, it never does.
What makes Julie and Julia remarkable is that life goes on for the characters. Julie is heartbroken, but she gets over it. Julia accepts that she will remain childless and that nothing can change that. The film, unlike other “based on a true story” adaptations, doesn’t sugarcoat its rough edges; rather, it presents them as unabashedly as the joyful moments, like a medley of different ingredients, and this is what makes it a joy to watch.

Guy meets girl. Girl loves guy. Guy is a jerk. Guy kills his best friend. Guy loves girl. Girl’s got another guy.
In an extremely small nutshell, this is the plot of Eugene Onegin, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s most popular and enduring opera. You may have seen posters around campus for it, as the Pittsburgh Opera is performing it at the end of the month, and Carnegie Mellon students can get some pretty cheap tickets. If you’ve never seen an opera before, Onegin is a great place to start.
Based on Pushkin’s epic poem of the same name, Eugene Onegin is set in Russia in the 1820s. The opera begins with the cynical Onegin accompanying his friend Lensky to the home of Lensky’s fiancee, Olga. When Olga’s older sister Tatyana spies Onegin, she is smitten. She writes him a letter, which he flatly rejects, telling her he is not suited or inclined to marry. Later, he is convinced by Lensky to go to a party for Tatyana, only to flirt with Olga instead. Lensky is furious, and, in a fateful duel, Onegin kills him.
The final act takes place many years later as a dejected Onegin visits Tatyana at the home of her husband — a prince. They confess their love for one another, but she has resolved to stay with her husband. At the finale, she leaves him alone without friends or a lover.
Oddly enough, the story eerily parallels Tchaikovsky’s own life. While writing Onegin, he received a letter from a former student of his, Antonina Milyukoff, confessing that she had been madly in love with him since her days at school. He rejected her, but as he wrote the opera, he began to wonder if he, too, would end up alone. After a second letter, he told her that he did not love her — many think that he was a closeted homosexual — but he agreed to marry her. The marriage, unfortunately, was short-lived, and Tchaikovsky suffered a nervous breakdown, fleeing to Switzerland to recuperate. What may have transpired between Tatyana and Onegin is left to the imagination, but Tchaikovsky was truly not suited for marriage.
Metropolitan Opera regular Dwayne Croft sings the title role, with rising Russian star Anna Samuil as Tatyana. Raymond Very, husband of Carnegie Mellon assistant professor of voice Laura Knoop Very, sings the role of Lensky, Onegin’s ill-fated friend.
If you think that opera is outdated and only for old women with funny glasses, just give this one a try — you may find yourself in a love affair of your own.

Dear Prerna,
I have been dating my high school boyfriend since two years before college, but now that I am here juggling the relationship, meeting new people, and working, everything has gotten overwhelming. I love my boyfriend and don’t want that to end, but I don’t think I am able to do justice to all three simultaneously. What should I do?
—Three’s A Crowd
Dear Crowd,
Wow. That’s a really complicated and exhausting situation you’re in: You want to give your boyfriend time, but still make great friends and maintain good grades. First of all, let me remind you of the most important thing: You’re in college! You should enjoy every moment of it. If I were you, I’d make sure my grades were up to the mark and then I’d go out and meet new people, join different clubs, socialize with the kids on my floor — the works.
There are some really great people out there that are eager to get to know you. But, at the same time, I wouldn’t neglect my boyfriend. At every given instance I’d keep him in the loop, however difficult it might be to communicate and convey how I feel. Your boyfriend is probably in the same boat as you, so it’s important to understand each other and try and compromise. You’re still a lucky first-year and, believe me, this opportunity never comes back again. Just be respectful of his time, thoughts, and beliefs. Set ground rules and clearly lay out the expectations. It is much simpler with everything clearly laid out. 
Live it; you deserve it,
—Prerna
Dear Prerna,
I am in my senior year and I have been going crazy with the BOC; however, I cannot find a job that fits my bill. I’ve gotten interviews with some companies but I don’t think they interest me. What should I do? I am graduating very soon and I need to decide.
—Unhappy and Unemployed
Dear Unemployed,
First of all, I’d like to remind you that you are not the only one in this situation. With the increasing number of career options in today’s economy, people are becoming more choosey and can’t seem to find anything that fits their description of “the perfect job.”
I personally recommend looking into other options as well. Do you really need a job or are you willing to wait it out? You can do a master’s program or travel the world in the meantime; this can really help you figure out what you want from life. How I’d love to take a year off from school and travel the world!
If you do need a job, do some more research and try finding what suits you. There are plenty of options out there. I would highly recommend you go through your interviews and, later, narrow down your options. You can pick a job and then switch later if you find something else that works better for you. Remember, it isn’t easy to find your dream job on the first shot.
Rework your résumé,
—Prerna

Hail to the new Margaret Morrison class! A news brief from the beginning of the year indicates that due to the scarcity of out-of-town girls, there won’t be a dormitory for Margaret Morrison this year. Those from distant cities are told to find their own homes. It’s somewhat depressing to know that Carnegie Mellon has always been lacking on the female side of the gender ratio.

An editorial board cartoon shows things that students should stock up for Homecoming. Among these items are a buggy, cherry pop, and “beverages which we are not allowed to mention in college publications XXX.” It’s a shame they couldn’t print the words $%# and %$#%& back in the day — a real shame.

Sept. 25, 1984
In a Forum article titled “In search of: The Ultimate Slice of Cheesecake,” the author laments how he has just recently discovered the joys of cheesecake and expresses his happiness at no longer being a “cheesecake-virgin.” Hmm, I’d think most college students would be a little more concerned with a slightly different type of virginity than the cheesecake variety.

Did you know that during the late ’90s, The Tartan’s comics page was inhabited by the likes of Dilbert, FoxTrot, and a few other name brand comics? I’m sure you didn’t, which is why I’m telling you now. Not that it matters now, of course, like many of the things I write here. In fact, I can’t wait for future “Did you know?” writers to comment on how the late 2000s were completely lacking in humor.

Sept. 20, 2004
An editorial board piece calls for a reform to the Student Dormitory Council (SDC) budget, specifically in regards to Buggy and its huge, and largely unchecked, budget. The piece notes that while all organizations receive the same amount for Buggy, SDC has loads of funds that could be redirected. Who would have thought poor college students would ever take advantage of excess cash here at Carnegie Mellon?

After months of anticipation, Senators Barack Obama and John McCain announce their running mates, Joe Biden and Sarah Palin. Wow, can you believe it has only been a year that we’ve been making fun of nearly every single aspect of Palin’s existence? But it’s okay; she can see Russia from her house.

Bill Gates, co-chair and trustee of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and chairman of Microsoft Corp., dedicated the Gates Center for Computer Science to the future of technological progress at Carnegie Mellon. “It is an honor and privilege to be involved with Carnegie Mellon,” said Gates in a keynote address to students and faculty. A ribbon cutting ceremony followed the address.
“I’m always inspired when I come here — inspired by the great minds that are here and the ones that will be coming here,” said Gates. “I’ll be following your work, and I can’t wait to see these great advances are delivered and the progress that will enable.”
Gates previously visited Carnegie Mellon last February. He was once again welcomed to the campus on Tuesday afternoon by a throng of students and faculty members in Wiegand Gymnasium, University Center, where he shared his thoughts on the university’s technological initiatives, as well as technological outreach worldwide.

This week, Carnegie Mellon is in the midst of an international meeting of the minds as the world’s leading economic experts arrive in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh will soon host the G20 Economic Summit, a meeting of leaders from 20 of the world’s emerging and industrialized countries to discuss the need for change and cooperation in the global economy. In the wake of the most recent recession, the conference is expected to touch on a number of important issues, including sources for global growth, the role of financial regulation and trade, educating the modern workforce, and renewing globalization.
The conference will officially begin on Thursday and end on Friday. Carnegie Mellon will host an event prior to the opening: a day-long conference on Wednesday, sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Atlantic Council.
“The heightened awareness within the campus community concerning what is going on in the world is as significant to me as the heightened awareness in the world about what is going on at Carnegie Mellon,” said Lee Branstetter, an associate professor of economics and public policy for the Heinz College and the Department of Social and Decision Sciences at Carnegie Mellon.
The Carnegie Mellon conference, “Renewing Globalization and Economic Growth in a Post-Crisis World,” will include speakers Daniel Rooney, the U.S. ambassador to Ireland; Jared L. Cohon, president of Carnegie Mellon University; Shaha Ali Riza and Mansoor Dailami, from the World Bank; and many others representing such groups as the Federal Reserve, BNY Mellon, and the U.S. Treasury.
Branstetter, one of the event’s speakers, brought up some of the topics he expects to be widely discussed at Carnegie Mellon as well as throughout the summit. These topics include economic policy reform, open trade, the U.S. decision to raise Chinese tire imports, the need for international economic organizations such as the IMF and World Bank to better represent developing countries, and approaches to climate change policy.
Robert Atkinson, adjunct professor of marketing in the Tepper School of Business and another event speaker, wrote in official literature for the event about the need for economic policy to create a new globalization “that shifts the core economic policies of nations from mercantilist, export-led strategies to innovation-based, domestic-growth strategies.”
Branstetter spoke about his feelings on the feasibility of implementing of such policies.
“There will be great reluctance to swiftly and substantially change the regulatory framework at a time when public emotions are running high but the financial system remains fragile,” he said. “A more likely outcome is that the major economies will continue [to] push for an overhaul and strengthening of the basic regulatory framework under which international banks are required to operate.”
Discussions of the G20 have already covered a wide range of topics, including education as a key component to this new globalization. This will be one of the main topics of the Carnegie Mellon conference.
“Countries that can successfully replicate the U.S. research university enterprise will secure for themselves a strong position for the future, for they will be the source of the next wave of economic expansion in the world,” wrote Pradeep Khosla, dean of the Carnegie Institute of Technology and another of the event’s speakers, in the report published for the event.
Decisions made at the Pittsburgh Summit will be discussed at future G20 and international meetings, such as in the case of global warming made by Branstetter.
“At the end of 2009, in Copenhagen, there will be a major international summit on climate change designed to produce a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, which required all signatory states to accept and implement significant reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions,” he said. “If we ever hope to achieve anything meaningful in Copenhagen, then we need a more productive discussion between developing and developed countries about a possible compromise on climate change.”
No matter what comes out of the conference, it has been a big deal for the city of Pittsburgh. The city has spent $34 million in preparation, according to the Post-Gazette, and has been singled out in a White House press report as being chosen for its “commitment to employing new and green technology to further economic recovery and development.”
According to Branstetter, the conference itself is an achievement.
“I think that institutionalizing this regular high-level exchange between developed and developing countries is more important than the substance that gets issued at the end of each summit,” he said.
A full schedule of events held throughout Pittsburgh can be found at pittsburghg20.org. Events will take place throughout the week in preparation for the official summit opening on Thursday.

After Los Angeles art collector and businessman Richard L. Weisman left his home on Sept. 2, his 10-print series of Warhol portraits called “The Athletes” and a Warhol portrait of Weisman were stolen. 
The next day, a domestic worker arrived at the home, went into the dining room, and upon seeing the blank walls called the police.
“There were no signs of forced entry,” Los Angeles Police Department detective Don Hrycyk told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. “The only lead police have are sightings of a maroon van that might have been parked nearby.”
“The Athletes” series includes portraits of Muhammad Ali, Chris Evert, Robert Gilbert, Dorothy Hamill, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jack Nicklaus, Pele, Tom Seaver, Willie Shoemaker, and O.J. Simpson. Weisman commissioned Warhol, a friend of his, to paint “The Athletes” in 1977.
Tom Sokolowski, director of The Warhol museum here in Pittsburgh, told the Tribune-Review that Warhol made eight prints of the series, and that they interested Weisman, a sports lover, because he wanted to unite the elements of leisure, art, and sports.
Weisman, the son of art collectors, owns more than one set of “The Athletes,” and brought one of them to The Warhol museum in Pittsburgh in 2005. 
The originals of the other sets exist for each image but in different colors. According to Bloomberg News, Weisman tried to sell one of his sets for $28 million in 2007.
“I was always familiar with the Campbell’s soup can painting and [Warhol’s] paintings of similar images with different colors,” said sophomore business administration major Toro Adeyemi. “Factory Girl made me find him even more interesting. I’m not shocked someone stole one of his paintings, as I’m sure it was brilliant, but I am surprised from the lack of respect in the act.”
Warhol was a leading figure in the pop art movement. After a successful career as a commercial illustrator, Warhol became famous worldwide for his work as a painter, avant-garde filmmaker, record producer, author, and public figure known for his membership in wildly diverse social circles. 
Warhol was also a Pittsburgh native, and studied commercial art at the School of Fine Arts at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, now Carnegie Mellon.
“I think that his art still has a big influence on our culture today,” said Gabrielle Page, a sophomore biomedical and mechanical engineering double major. “You see it a lot in fashion with pop art and bold colors. I think that a lot of the usage of bold prints and colors comes from his influence. Because it’s so evident today, it doesn’t surprise me that someone would want to steal his paintings.”
A $1 million reward has been offered for information regarding the recovery of the stolen collection.

As G20 fervor spreads to campus, the Carnegie Mellon community will have the opportunity to hear Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd give a special keynote address, followed by a panel discussion of policy experts. The prime minister’s address is scheduled to take place on Thursday in Rangos Hall in the University Center at 5 p.m. Doors open at 4 p.m. to allow guests to be seated.
Rudd is the 26th prime minister of the Commonwealth of Australia and the occupant of the country’s most powerful office. He also heads the center-left Australian Labor Party on a federal level. After joining the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1981, Rudd pursued his career in foreign service at posts in the Australian embassies in Stockholm, Sweden and in Beijing, China. Throughout his political career, Rudd has been on the forefront of educational reforms, particularly those advocating the importance of teaching foreign languages in Australian schools.
Rudd is a strong proponent of policies related to climate change and aims for Australia to demonstrate international leadership in this field, according to the climate change plan he describes in a video clip on his personal website. As stated in The Australian, the prime minister has also established a commission for nuclear non-proliferation. He looks toward the G20 as a major international summit for “multilateral engagement,” as stated in the article.
Before flying into Pittsburgh for the G20 conference, Rudd will attend the UN General Assembly meeting in New York.
The address is expected to strengthen Carnegie Mellon’s reputation as an international university, as the Carnegie Mellon satellite campus in Adelaide, Australia houses programs in the university’s Heinz College. An effort that began almost four years ago, the Australian campus serves as the university’s Asia Pacific education base. It currently offers two master’s degrees — the master of science in public policy and management and the master of science in information technology.
As with the speeches of President Barack Obama and former Indian president A.P.J. Abdul Kalam given at Carnegie Mellon in the past, Rudd’s speech is aimed at enriching the campus community’s experience of hearing a head of state talk about international affairs and policies.
The event is sponsored by Carnegie Mellon University, the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, the Pittsburgh Technology Council, and the World Affairs Council of Pittsburgh, along with the H. John Heinz III College, Carnegie Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon Economics Society, and the International Relations and Politics Program.

In recent decades, economic restructuring has radically reduced demand for low-skilled manual labor, and mass unemployment has become a durable, structural feature of South African society. 
Ferguson suggested that the South African experience reveals, in an extreme and clarifying form, a set of processes that are occurring in many other parts of the world and that better understanding of such processes may help us to find our way past some of the current impasses in progressive politics.
When: Oct. 5, 4:30 p.m.
Where: Gregg Hall (Porter 100)

Graduates excel in scholarship program
Carnegie Mellon graduates Ally Reeves, Gregory Newby, and Julia Stein were recently named recipients of the prestigious U.S. Student Fulbright Scholarship. The Fulbright Scholars Program originated in 1946 as a way to promote learning among the United States and other countries of the world.
Reeves graduated in 2008 from the masters of fine arts program and plans to work in Mumbai, India, with an international organization called Partners for Urban Knowledge, Action, and Research to create installation art and participate in research. Her primary work will concern how street vendors were portrayed in media from the 19th century to modern times.
Newby, who earned a bachelor’s degree in 2009 in biological sciences, will be researching in the lab of professor Andreas Plückthun at the biochemistry institute of the University of Zurich in Switzerland. The research will focus on creating a molecular, fluorescent sensor that will monitor protein modifications inside living cells, which could help identify new targets for cancer therapy.
A bachelor of humanities and arts 2008 graduate, Stein will travel to Helsinki, Finland to enter the master of arts degree program in live art and performance studies at the Theatre Academy Helsinki. She plans to participate in the production of a film with Finnish artist.
More information on Fulbright at Carnegie Mellon can be found at www.cmu.edu/fso/fulbright/index.html.
Flu season approaches with H1N1
Student Health Services held its seasonal flu clinics on Sept. 17 from 8:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. in the Dowd Room and from 1:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. in Student Health Services. There was another clinic scheduled, but the turnout to the first clinic was so large that Health Services expected to run out of the vaccine, and announced that the second clinic on Sept. 18 was canceled. 
In an e-mail sent to the campus community, Anita Barkin, director of Student Health Services, reassured the community that more flu vaccines are on order and there will be more clinics to come. She also reiterated that “the seasonal influenza vaccine is distinct from the H1N1 vaccine, which will not be available nationally until late October or November,” as well as encouraging that everyone exercise good hygiene habits.
There is no charge for the vaccine if one is covered under Carnegie Mellon University insurance or Highmark insurance plans; otherwise the cost is $15.
A new single-dose vaccine for the H1N1 virus was approved on Sept. 15, and the vaccines should become available next month, according to U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius.

You should know that you have messed up when the President of the United States calls you a “jackass.” America quickly condemned Kanye West’s actions from the moment he grabbed the microphone from a trembling 19-year-old pop-country singer, Taylor Swift. While many people in the media have extensively discussed West’s actions, President Obama stated the events most eloquently: he was a jackass. He messed up.
With that distinction out of the way, what do we do now? Do we just forgive him, or do we decide to boycott his music? West deserves neither to be crucified nor defended. The importance lies within realizing what we as Americans value.
This was not West’s first dabble in immaturity. I still remember when he uttered, “George Bush doesn’t care about black people.” America didn’t prevent his rise to the top then, and it won’t now. He is entrenched in our culture. His music has the ability to move us; his lyrics to reach our spiritual selves. He will be considered a “jackass,” but the American people will put his food on the table without problem.
The recent release of 808s and Heartbreak revealed the more melancholy aspect of West’s personality. In the past, he perceived himself as a slandered saint while ranting about various offenses, but this newest outburst has had a different effect on him. Merely a day after the MTV awards, West was one instant away from bursting out in tears during an interview with Jay Leno in front of a national audience.
Despite his repentance, he clearly deserves rebuke for his actions. Countless YouTube comments — often noted as the paragon of intellectual human discourse — advocate knee-jerk reactions. There were calls for boycotts, and people slammed his credibility as an artist. A complete knee-jerk reaction leads down a perilous path. He didn’t commit a crime. He simply violated an unspoken set of traditional “American Values.”
Should we boycott Serena Williams for her actions in the U.S. Open? Must we revoke Michael Vick’s license? If we disassociate America with West, then we should also revoke McEnroe’s membership to the Tennis Hall Of Fame.
I don’t mean to defend West; rather, I would like to note that art’s worth is not dependent upon the artist’s public persona, much like a great novel isn’t dependent upon the personality of the author. Swift is the unfortunate victim of a depraved violation of traditional American values, but America will forgive Kanye West. People will buy his albums, DJs will play his music in clubs, and people will go to his concerts (he just announced a world tour with Lady GaGa).
West’s rap in Jay-Z’s new single, “Run This Town,” interestingly runs surprisingly parallel to this cultural event. During West’s performance of the song on Jay Leno, he awkwardly squeaks out the first two lines, “it’s crazy how you can go from Joe Blow/To everybody on your dick, no homo.” He regains some swagger and realizes the consequences of fame, asking for “please no photos.” Fame isn’t simply being on top of the world. It comes with responsibilities to follow unspoken American values.
The pivotal line is then interjected: “This is the life that everybody ask for.” West has lived through the most extreme highs and lows that America can offer. His musical ability places him within a select group of extremely iconic people within America’s history, and his public persona has continually been defined by his inability to adapt to traditional American values.
West is both a jackass and an extremely talented person — no one would deny him either of these descriptions. In the eventuality of West’s return to the top of the charts, American history will repeat itself. We are a group of people made up of various dishonorable qualities. We all do wrong sometimes. American society attempts to perpetuate its traditional values. Those that violate them are rebuked, but with time are forgiven and allowed to rejoin the community.
Christopher Jarrett (cjarrett@) realizes that even he is a jackass sometimes.

I know I’ve written about Barbie and her involvement in fashion before, when she (technically, Mattel) had her own fashion show during New York’s Fashion Week. But Mattel has recently released a video to promote their new “Barbie Fashionista” line that has caused me to bring up our favorite plastic friend once again.
If you’re a child of the ’90s and listened to any pop music during your childhood at all, you likely know Aqua’s famous — or infamous — song “Barbie Girl.” Though the song was catchy with its witty and easy-to-learn (and thus, easy to sing along to) lyrics, it perhaps did not cast the best light on Mattel and Barbie. Lines like “You can brush my hair/ Undress me everywhere” and “Come on Barbie, let’s go party,” especially with the latter voiced by the sexy-voiced supposed Ken, do not exactly leave Barbie with the innocent, girl-next-door persona that the doll began with.
And Mattel agreed. In fact, the company actually sued Aqua over the song in 1997; a Rolling Stone article states that Mattel claimed that the song “contains lyrics that ‘associate sexual and other unsavory themes with Mattel’s Barbie products.’”
Mattel, however, has since changed their tune (pun intended) and is embracing the song wholeheartedly by using it as the theme song of their commercial-slash-music-video for their new line, Barbie Fashionista. They have changed the lyrics, which now contain phrases like “I’ve got lots of friends, the party never ends” and begins with a conversation between, again, a sexy, low-voiced Ken doll and a high-pitched, squeal-y Barbie doll that concludes with some rather questionable pelvic thrusts from Ken.
And the video doesn’t feature only the plastic dolls themselves; instead, real-life versions of Barbie and Ken can be seen, with the former wearing tight shirts and skirts so short that I’m afraid that while they’re “doing the Barbie” dance during the video they’re going to flash all of the little girls that I’m sure are staring wide-eyed at the screen in their homes.
I have a number of problems with the Barbie Fashionista music video. The first is, of course, the message that the dancing and singing of the video is sending to the little girls who are assuredly watching and memorizing so that they, too, can “do the Barbie” next time the video comes on. When I played with Barbies — which I did quite often — I played with Veterinarian Barbie, Doctor Barbie, even Wheelchair Barbie. Barbies were created to show that girls could do whatever they wanted, that girls didn’t have to be homemakers or secretaries, that they could do more (though, as evidenced by the elaborate Barbie houses that you can buy, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with being a stay-at-home mom). The only message I can see in the new Barbie line is one that tells girls they can wear cute, slightly slutty clothes and dance with boys.
Fashion is a perfectly respectable profession, but the Barbie Fashionista line isn’t about working in fashion, whether as a designer, stylist, or fashion journalist. The line seems rather to be about being a socialite — wearing cute clothes, showing off, and being famous. I don’t really think this is something that little girls should aspire to be. There’s nothing wrong with being famous in fashion, if you work for it, but the line seems to be more about being famous and wearing the clothes rather than the hard work that goes into their creation, giving a bad name to real fashionistas everywhere, who do actually put effort into their work.
With Barbie’s new line coming out right after the doll had her own show at Fashion Week, Mattel should have focused more on the actual fashion aspect of the doll and her accessories rather than merely the looking good part. I think it would’ve been really interesting to see a Barbie whose accessories were fashion sketches, or a mannequin with different swatches of clothing that could be put on it. But by saying that a fashionista is nothing more than a girl who looks good in pretty clothes, Mattel is not only minimizing the actual amount of work that goes into the fashion industry, they’re also going against Barbie’s core value: the belief that girls can do anything. Instead of giving the Barbie Fashionista line some type of reality, they are instead saying that girls should strive to look pretty, dance provocatively, and go after the guy. This just seems to be reinforcing all the things that the original “Barbie Girl” song was mocking, and the things that Mattel sued Aqua over.
Mattel needs to reconsider what they are promoting when they decide to use a song like “Barbie Girl” to advertise their new product line. They may have changed the lyrics (though I don’t believe the new ones are much better), but that doesn’t mean that girls won’t wonder what the song is from and find it within seconds on YouTube. And even in the new version of the song, the real-life “Barbies” are not any more ideal role models for young girls than the plastic dolls described in Aqua’s version of the song. They should reconsider a shift back to the old Barbies — the ones that encouraged girls to be whatever they wanted to be.
Heather Tomko (htomko@) is Forum editor and is not going to be “doing the Barbie” anytime soon.

By now, most people are aware that employers scour the Internet looking for information about their potential employees, but that does not seem to stop anyone from using social networking or blogging sites.
Recently, some lawyers have come under fire for their blog posts criticizing judges or revealing privileged information about a case. The authors of these posts are receiving disciplinary action, including fines and even a loss of the right to practice law.
While these two situations are different, and criticizing a judge in no way equates with revealing secret information about a case, the responses of the courts and the bar were extreme and seem to violate the First Amendment. A New York Times article discussing the issue states that because the criticisms were not aimed at a problem with the court system, they were not covered under the First Amendment, and it is stated that members of the court system (including lawyers and judges) lose their full right to criticize that system.
What seems strange to me is that there are not better protections under the First Amendment. Does working for the government mean you should never be able to criticize it? I don’t think so.
Dissatisfaction at work is nothing new, and as long as people have jobs, they will criticize them. Whether people complain through speaking or writing, their thoughts should be protected under the First Amendment. If an attorney thinks that a judge’s actions are unfair, he or she should have every right to criticize them, whether in a formal setting or in a blog.
Blogs are a form of journalism, and in journalism, it is perfectly legitimate to voice concerns as long as there is evidence to back it up; in one of the cases in the New York Times article, an attorney complained that the judge in question gave defense attorneys three fewer weeks to prepare their cases than other judges. This is a substantiated claim, and there is no reason to say that this should not be protected under the First Amendment.
This is not to say, however, that everything should be protected under the First Amendment, as in the case of the attorney who blogged about her cases.
Attorneys, much like doctors, are required to keep information told to them by their clients private. Anything said behind closed doors should never be revealed, except by the person whose secrets they are to tell. That means that they should not be revealed in blogs.
Blogs are a great means of expressing one’s thoughts, but they should not be used to give away information that should be kept secret. In addition, opinions about whether clients are guilty or innocent should not be written in blogs; these sorts of mistakes can lead to problems and repercussions for clients.
It is important to remember that while our freedom of speech allows us to say many things, some things, like other people’s secrets, should be left unsaid and unwritten.
This is not the case for complaints about employers or coworkers, however, and these things should be protected under the First Amendment as long as they do not contain false information. Revealing true information that can be backed up by facts is one thing; making up information just to make someone look bad is another thing entirely.
Until the government passes legislation forbidding employers to use things that employees — or potential employees — say or write against them, however, the best thing to do is not to post anything online that they would not want to see on the front page of a newspaper — or at least add some kind of protection to limit who can see it.
Amanda Cole (acole@) is the former editor-in-chief of The Tartan and always makes sure that her blogs are friends-only.

My home is a mere three hours away from Mumbai, and I have many relatives living there. The terror attacks that happened in November of last year rattled me. When I went back home that year during winter break, I realized the general sentiments of people — they were upset, and mostly at the government. In fact, the people’s anger led to the chief minister of Maharashtra’s resignation. I felt then that the government would try its best to get back into the people’s good books. For some time, it did feel like the government was trying to speed up the investigation, and that the court case of the sole captured gunman, Ajmal Kasab, was progressing quickly. Investigations led to the mapping out of how the terrorists entered the country and also to the narrowing down on the group responsible for the attack.
However, things seemed to come to a halt. Kasab confessed in court to having been a part of the attack, but the court decided that it needed more evidence to sentence him. Last week, Pakistan agreed to charge the seven suspects in the case, but also said that it would need more evidence to charge the leader of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba group, which was held primarily responsible for the attacks.
Both these instances amaze me. In July, Kasab confessed to having opened fire on crowds in Mumbai and described details of the planning of the attack. He also described how he trained with the Lashkar-e-Taiba. Apparently, having thousands of people see someone carry a gun and shoot indiscriminately in broad daylight is not enough evidence. Having this gunman confess that he was involved in the attacks is not enough evidence against him. Having Kasab name the Lashkar-e-Taiba in his statements is not enough evidence against their leader. I understand that the courts want to be thorough and carry out a complete investigation of the matter, but I wonder how much more evidence they will ask for, and more importantly, how much more evidence they will get. I believe there really is not much more that can be learned.
Though it has been nearly a year since the terror attacks took place, the news never seems to change. I have grown tired of reading the same things again and again. People back home have grown accustomed to picking up the newspaper, shaking their heads, and putting it back down. The consensus seems to be that the case will remain frozen like this for a very long time. However, I wish that all those involved with making decisions in this aspect would realize that they are playing with the emotions of millions of people, many of whom have lost much at the hands of these terrorists.
Akanksha Vaidya (avvaidya@) is Sci/Tech editor and doesn’t need more evidence to figure out that Indians are unhappy about the way this case is being handled.

Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen a multitude of displays advertising extracurricular groups all over campus as they gear up for recruitment. Information sessions are noted on the sidewalk from Forbes Avenue past the Purnell Center for the Arts, promises of free pizza — and information about us! — dance across the ground outside of Kirr Commons, and reasons to go Greek are scattered around the Fence.
This type of group effort and extracurricular spirit is great, and a nice change from the normally pervasive apathy in which our campus is shrouded for the colder months of the year. But the way in which some of this information is being conveyed — through spray chalk — is questionable at best.
Messages to “join a sorority” and “go Greek” were spray-chalked on sidewalk surfaces from outside Resnik Hall and West Wing, past the University Center, and going toward Doherty, Baker, and Porter Halls, accompanied by spray-chalked stencils of the “go Greek” logo.
These messages elicited normally chalked replies to sororities about their use of spray chalk. While its use is currently not explicitly prohibited, Student Senate has just approved a resolution against the spray chalk on campus.
While chalking — or really any type of advertising for recruitment for a Greek organization, buggy team, or cross-cultural alliance — is fun and important for a group’s continued membership,  organizations should remember that spray chalking is semi-permanent. Advertising for an information session scheduled to happen in two days when spray chalk can last up to two weeks renders the information useless and ties up the space for any future advertising.
Moreover, with both Bill Gates’ visit and the G20 happening on or near campus this week, leftover spray chalk smudged across prominent sidewalk areas and the sides of buildings could look sloppy and distracting.
Maybe we need a more efficient way of recruiting for student organizations and advertising for that recruitment on campus. Or, better, we need to use the resources that are already available. Chalk for short-term events — where the rain can wash away the message — but hang a sign over the entrance to Doherty or poster the bulletin boards in the University Center for more permanent notices.

According to ABC, President Obama has dipped his toes into pop culture. Last week, after Kanye West rudely stole the microphone from innocent little Taylor Swift after she won her first VMA, the President reportedly called the hip hop star a “jackass.”
Was it justified? Probably. Obama was simply providing a reason for why a famous rap star would make “a perfectly nice” little girl cry. And no one, except maybe Kanye himself, seems to be particularly enraged about this comment, as the interruption was clearly rude.
Obama spoke like a normal person would have. However, normal people do not have to represent their country. He realized this, and so he followed his statement with a comment intended to cover his own tail, asking reporters to “cut the President some slack... I’ve got a lot of other stuff on my plate.”
But why should he have needed to cover his actions? Obama was in a closed session with reporters talking “off the record.” That record includes the Twitter record for journalist Terry Moran, who posted the comment, which spread across the Internet possibly faster than Kanye’s original comments and the successive Internet meme. ABC has since offered an official apology for their breach of journalistic integrity, posting a comment that discusses the expectations of privacy involved in an off-the-record session.
For journalists to maintain the respect that they once held, they need to adhere to the values of the profession. Conversations that are off the record should stay as such to maintain a level of trust and a rapport that would be impossible otherwise. While the future of traditional journalism seems uncertain, breaches like this one can only further erode what remains.
This erosion is already being multiplied by blogs like TMZ, which first published the entire audio clip of Obama’s comments, and then later posted the video. The record was clearly running.
The question that comes out of all this is whether off-the-record conversations can continue to exist, or if they are just one piece of the multi-faceted journalistic tradition that is being killed by our new, pervasive digital world.

By now you’ve heard, probably many times, about the G20 Summit’s rapid approach and the numerous events that are coming along with it, as well as the additional security and closings. The number of Official Communications e-mails concerning the G20 and G20-related events on Carnegie Mellon’s campus now rivals the number we received about the swine flu when the scare was at its height.
Not only is the university keeping the student body informed of what is going on with the summit and the city, it is making a visible effort to involve Carnegie Mellon students in as much of the Summit as possible. In addition to the Official Communications e-mails, there is also a website that can be accessed detailing the numerous events scheduled related to the summit, both on campus and in the city, at www.cmu.edu/g20.
And the events really are numerous — there was an expert preview panel composed of a number of distinguished Carnegie Mellon professors, and a G20 Awareness Fair was held for students this past week. Still to come are a media panel, discussions hosted by the People’s Summit, and, of course, the keynote address by Kevin Rudd, prime minister of the Commonwealth of Australia.
We appreciate that the university is making such an effort to keep Carnegie Mellon and its students so involved in the happenings of the G20 in the city. An event of this importance has the potential to alienate those in the city not directly involved in the conference, especially with the added security measures that the summit is bringing with it.
We are glad that the administration is taking measures to keep that from happening and is instead being proactive and involving the student body in whatever ways are possible.

I‘ve done it again. I have gone and volunteered myself for a position that will subtract time from and add stress to my life. I have already been inundated with important problems I must make decisions about. I am in heaven.
Like many of my fellow students on campus, I am caught up in the throes of a leadership role in one of Carnegie Mellon’s student organizations. Unlike a great deal of these leaders, however, I am a graduate student.
The school I attended for undergraduate study did not even allow graduate students to vote in campus organizations, let alone serve in the capacity I have just taken on as editor-in-chief of The Tartan. But Carnegie Mellon not only encourages students to cross disciplinary and ethnic borders, it also allows them to cross the great divide: undergraduate versus graduate study.
Consider the wonderful opportunities for independent research offered to undergraduate students through programs like SURG or the chance to publish significant studies in campus journals, such as Thought. These kinds of chances are afforded only to graduate students at many universities.
The most fulfilling chasm crossing I have been able to do has been the chance to get my hands dirty serving in student organizations.
At my undergraduate school, I served as the head of the copy editing department for two years for our campus newspaper. I thought that when I graduated, my career at campus papers was over, but I was proven wrong the day I walked through the door of The Tartan’s office on the third floor of the University Center — yes, fellow graduate students, there is a third floor to that building.
The then editor-in-chief, Matt Campbell, encouraged me to come on as a member of the copy staff, not an unusual pursuit of students in the master of arts in professional writing program that is my home here at Carnegie Mellon. From there, it was a small step up the ladder to serving as copy manager, a comparable role to the one I served in two years ago during my undergraduate years.
One of the best features of The Tartan is the wide range of roles available to students, even aside from working with the content — from serving on the advertising and business staff to operating the website to overseeing the staff. If you show enough interest, you will very likely move into a leadership role that looks fantastic on a résumé, no matter your interest: a leadership position illustrates responsibility, leadership, and charisma.
The time and the stress are nothing compared to the opportunities that being editor-in-chief of The Tartan will provide me.
