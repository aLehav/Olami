Last weekend, the Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team traveled to Case Western Reserve University to compete in the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships. Entering as the third seed in the tournament, the Tartans needed a couple of upsets to win it all, but were going into match play with a growing confidence after a few convincing wins over top teams. Unfortunately, the Tartans fell short in the semifinals against third-ranked University of Chicago, and ended up with a third-place finish in the tournament.
The tournament started out with promise for the Tartans, as they shook off a long bus ride and the disappointment of missing Carnival to defeat the Brandeis University Judges by a routine score of 5–0. Flying out of the gates, the Tartans immediately went up 3–0 in doubles. The toughest match came at the first doubles position, with the team of junior Ashley Herrick and sophomore Laura Chen beating their opponents by a score of 8–5. The second and third doubles teams had a much easier time, winning by scores of 8–3 and 8–2, respectively.
With a hefty lead in hand, the Tartans utilized their strong singles lineup to immediately beat the Judges in a quick decision. Chen started off the singles scoring with a convincing win, 6–0, 6–2. Soon after, fellow sophomore Cze-Ja Tam clinched the victory at fourth singles with a 6–2, 6–2 win to propel the Tartans into the semifinals.
On Saturday, the Tartans continued their UAA quest against powerhouse number-three University of Chicago. With a bit of momentum under their belt, the Tartans came out fighting, but the Maroons were just too strong. First-year Alex Tapak and sophomore Courtney Chin posed a tough challenge, but lost in a highly competitive match by a score of 8–5.
"Getting a lead in doubles is one of the best advantages you can have, but we fell short," Tapak said. "We really need to work on finishing off games and winning big points. At this high of a level of competition, there is a very small margin for error."
With their backs against the wall, the Tartans needed a miracle to pull off an upset victory. However, it wasn’t the right day, as Carnegie Mellon quickly dropped two matches at third and fourth singles. Under UAA rules, first singles plays to completion, so Chen continued a grueling three-setter. Unfortunately, she was unable to pull it out in the third set, losing by the final score of 6–2, 2–6, 6–2.
"It's always disappointing to lose 5–0, but Chicago is also a top-three team," Chen noted. "This loss really shows us we need to buckle down and work harder to close the gap.”
Coming off a tough loss, the Tartans looked to bounce back against the University of Rochester in the third-place match. The Tartans were up for the challenge, immediately sweeping doubles in a very convincing fashion. Highlighting the doubles play was an 8–2 victory by the number-one doubles team of Chen and Herrick. In singles play, the Tartans continued to flex their muscles, winning at first, third, and sixth singles. Herrick, making her season debut in the singles lineup, won by a score of 6–2, 6–2 to close out the match. Chen then finished off her opponent in two tough sets by a score of 7–5, 6–4 to add an extra point onto the match total. 
The Tartans will continue their quest for an NCAA title when they square off against sixth-ranked Washington & Lee College at home on Saturday, May 1.

In what most would hope to be a time of friendly competitive spirit and a culmination of hard work paid off, the day of finals for Buggy races instead became a day of disappointment for the Student Dormitory Council’s (SDC) Buggy teams. 
Last Saturday, all five of SDC’s men’s and women’s qualifying teams were disqualified due to a fire safety hazard near the group’s staging area.
Going into the final day of racing, SDC was a dominant force on the leader board. Its women’s A team rolled the third-best time in the history of Buggy for women’s teams on Friday (2:28.14), and its B and C teams were in the top five spots as well. The men’s A team, which raced in the preliminary heats on Friday with a very fast time of 2:04.61, was in first place going into the finals, and its B team was in third place.
Yet the rolls had not yet started Saturday before SDC got knocked out of the running. 
According to the report filed by fire marshal Robert Anderegg surveying the staging areas of all of the Buggy teams, SDC members took a propane tank out of their truck and carried it away from their staging area. While the team’s explanation was that the tank would be used to keep their pushers warm, its proximity to the staging area violated a fire safety rule set forth by Anderegg and the Sweepstakes governing body, and the organization was subsequently disqualified from racing in the finals.
The fire marshal’s response to SDC’s outcry was that propane tanks are not allowed at all in or in close proximity to a team’s staging area, since the gas will find a way to ignite itself if allowed to escape from the tank. 
The tank’s presence was viewed by the head judge and the Sweepstakes Committee as a direct violation of the official Carnegie Mellon Sweepstakes rules and regulations, which state “NO quantity of ANY combustible liquid is permitted in or near the buggy preparation areas,” a condition that warranted SDC’s disqualification. There is no clear definition or set distance, however, of what constitutes “near” the Buggy staging area.
The violation was immediately refuted by the team. According to Julian Kessler, SDC’s Buggy chairman, the propane tank was indeed present “near” the staging area, but was 20 feet up a hill from the buggy truck. Anderegg informed the Sweepstakes committee, however, that the tank was so close to the tent when he saw it in its initial position that it looked as though it had just emerged from the team’s staging area.
“Unfortunately, while identifying what counts as being in close proximity to one’s staging area is at times challenging, the propane tank was very clearly too close to this organization’s tent, and the rules about such a situation are black and white,” said Sweepstakes Chairman and graduate student Jessica Thurston. “Out of respect to the other organizations following the rules and for the safety of all student spectators, we have to be extremely strict about fire safety regulations. As such, after conferring with the fire marshal, the head judge, and our adviser, I had to uphold the call for disqualification.”
Within minutes of the incident, SDC’s head members were approached by Thurston, Anderegg, head judge Andrew Hundt (SCS 2009), and adviser Kaycee Palko. 
After learning SDC’s side of the story, including their explanation about the origins and placement of the propane tank, the committee upheld the fire marshal’s disqualification of SDC, as SDC was present at the fire safety meeting and signed an acknowledgment of the Sweepstakes bylaws and their consequences.
“We had all the intention of following the rules; we knew that the rules said no liquid or gas near or in the staging area,” Kessler said. “We placed the tank far away from the area. We never turned it on at all, and it went from my car up the hill, never in or near our truck.”
He continued, “At first most of us were just in shock. We were all really sad, and there was a lot of anger on everyone’s part. We appealed and explained to everyone, but the Sweepstakes chair kept the decision.”
According to Thurston, such decisions are made jointly by the chairman, adviser, and the year’s head judge. Decisions are then enforced by the head judge.
Fringe pusher Sara Wingen had mixed emotions about the matter. “The feeling is bittersweet. They were the only team ahead of us, and they’re great competitors.... It’s disappointing to see them disqualified. It’s easier to run when someone is chasing you, but this time we really had to find the internal motivation.”
With three women’s teams and two men’s teams taken out, the opportunity was there for Fringe A to take home the trophy for both the men’s and women’s races, which they did. The Sigma Phi Epsilon men’s A team and Pi Kappa Alpha women’s A team took second.
For the case of SDC, the official rules state that the maximum penalty such an offense is a 15-month suspension, the application of which is yet to be decided. 
In the 2009 Sweepstakes races, when Beta Theta Pi was found to have flammable liquid in a can inside its truck, the group was allowed to roll the next year under a strict probation.
“Disqualifying arguably the strongest buggy team on the course is something we never wanted to do, and something we did our best to avoid by having chairmen sign off on the bylaws and by signing in at and attending the fire safety training meeting we held three weeks ago,” Thurston said. “We will continue to work with SDC to get them back out on the course as soon as possible, and I hope that future Sweepstakes committees can further clarify the rules surrounding fire safety and ensure that they are followed properly so we never have to deal with such a situation again.”

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track and field teams challenged a variety of schools in the Westminster Invitational last Saturday, April 17. Despite the cold weather, the men placed second out of seven teams with 164.5 points, while the women placed fourth out of eight teams with 98 points.
The Tartan women scored first place in three events. The first of these came in the 800-meter run, when senior Diane Mattingly finished in 2:25.14, earning 10 points for the team. Mattingly was immediately followed by teammate junior Courtney Baker, who finished in second place with a time of 2:25.54. In the 100-meter dash, junior Kim Nederlof took third with a personal record of 13.47. In the 1500-meter run, junior Laura McKee took first with a time of 5:02.34, followed by first-year Emily Wobb, who snagged second in 5:04.37. Junior Danielle Morse was the sole representative of the Lady Tartans in the 5000-meter run, finishing in third with a time of 19:55.33, a new personal record.
In the hurdle events, the Tartans rose to the challenge of the competition when junior Morgan Faer grabbed third in the 100-meter hurdle, with a time of 17.15, while senior Crystal LeePow clinched third in the 400-meter hurdles in 1:10.93. On the field, sophomore Ivana Moses dominated for the Tartans once again, winning the triple jump and coming in third place in the long jump, with clearances of 10.20 meters and 4.88 meters, respectively. Junior Melissa Hwang also had a stellar performance, taking third in the triple jump and fifth in the long jump in 9.86 and 4.73 meters, respectively. In the javelin throw, first-year Carissa Iannone finished in fifth place, clearing 29.07 meters.
On the men’s side, the Tartans won a total of five events, but it was the depth of talent on the team that allowed them to come in second place overall. Junior Nate Bussiere won the 800-meter run in 1:55.12 and was followed shortly by teammates junior J.P. Allera and junior Jonathan Matusky, who came in third and fifth, respectively, with times of 2:03.22 and 2:06.70. In the 100-meter dash, first-year Noel Titus grabbed second with a personal best time of 11.28, while in the 400-meter dash, fellow first-year Ben Nealy claimed third with a time of 52.31. Junior Justin Kurp managed a second-place finish in the 1500-meter run, followed by first-year Evan Gates, who took third, with times of 4:10.13 and 4:11.33, respectively.
Perhaps the most exciting moment of the day was when sophomore Kyle Andrews, senior Chris Rizzo, and first-year Ben Finch took the top three places in the 5000-meter run, in 15:49.48, 15:50.65, and 16:11.44, respectively. Additionally, in the men’s 4x100-meter relay, the Tartans came out on top, winning the event in 44.31, with a team of first-year Titus, first-year John Caverhill, sophomore Ryan Kissell, and senior Chris Bridgman.
“I am very happy with the time I ran and the teamwork used to get it,” Andrews said. “[We paced] well together and orchestrally [swapped] the lead so that no one person took on the wind alone.”
On the field, the men continued to succeed when junior Pat O’Brien racked up two third-place finishes in the high jump and the triple jump, with distances of 1.75 meters and 12.84 meters, respectively. Bridgman continued to earn top points for the Tartans in the pole vault, with a height of 4.40 meters. In the long jump, Kissell took second by leaping 6.31 meters. Finally, senior James Hulley earned 20 points for the team by winning both the shot put and the discus throw, with throws of 14.35 meters and 44.08 meters, respectively.
“The team competed fiercely despite stinging rain, snow, hail, and winds,” said Andrews. “Also, in the absence of much competition, especially in the distance events, some respectable times were churned out by several teammates.... On the whole, the progress our team has made over the season is becoming more and more apparent, and I believe we are more than ready to destroy the competition next week at UAAs.”
The Tartans will be busy this weekend preparing for the UAA Outdoor Championships to be held in St. Louis, Mo. on April 24 and 25.

“Half this game is 90 percent mental.” ­­—Former Philadelphia Phillies manager Danny Ozark.
Were I ever to have met the late Mr. Ozark, I’d have argued that 90 percent of the game is half luck. The strategy is what makes baseball such an intricate sport, but the true excitement and frustration stem from the skill and luck involved.
All factors were especially apparent in two games on Saturday. The Colorado Rockies’ Ubaldo Jimenez pitched the first no-hitter in franchise history, shutting down the Braves in Atlanta as the Rockies rolled to a 4–0 win. The Mets and Cardinals, on the other hand, went head to head for 18 scoreless innings before each team scored a run in the 19th. The Mets came out on top, 2–1, after 20 very, very long innings.
The Braves have now been the victims of no-hitters in Atlanta twice in the last six years. Randy Johnson, as a member of the Arizona Diamondbacks, became the oldest pitcher to pitch a perfect game when he shut down all 27 Braves he faced at Turner Field on May 18, 2004. Having no hits doesn’t necessarily mean a team has poor hitting; it means the guy on the mound is nasty. It also means he’s got a whole lot of luck.
When Chicago White Sox pitcher Mark Buehrle pitched a perfect game last July 23 against Tampa Bay, his outfielder DeWayne Wise made a leaping, falling catch to rob the Rays’ Gabe Kapler of a home run and preserve the perfect game. That was pure skill on the part of Wise; it was pure luck on the part of Buehrle.
So it was that Ubaldo Jimenez took the mound on Saturday with Dexter Fowler in center field. The 6'5" Fowler is known for his speed, and he certainly put it on display to help the cause in Atlanta. With two incredible catches, one of them a completely sprawling, breakneck diving catch, Fowler saved the day for Jimenez and gave him the confidence that he could do something special on that mound.
To me, there is nothing more awe-inspiring than a pitcher throwing a no-hitter, especially a perfect game. My brother Linus was lucky enough to be at Yankee Stadium on May 17, 1998 — Beanie Baby Day — when New York’s David Wells threw a perfect game against the Minnesota Twins. My dad was almost as lucky — he got to see the Mets’ Tom Seaver take a perfect game into the ninth inning before it was broken up.
Pitching a no-hitter is the ultimate accomplishment. It shows how dominant a pitcher can be. Every team has great players, and even the lesser players are still good enough to make the major leagues. Everyone is capable of getting a hit. When Wells pitched his perfect game, Hall of Famer Paul Molitor and then-superstar Marty Cordova were in the lineup for the Twins, and both were silenced. 
When Jimenez pitched on Saturday, he faced a potent lineup that included future Hall of Famer Chipper Jones and the prince of baseball, Jason Heyward. That lineup was silenced as well.
In St. Louis on Saturday, a game that was broadcast on FOX beginning at 4 p.m. ended a little after 11. While no pitcher was perfect, the Cardinals’ Jaime Garcia did have a no-hitter through the first five innings. The Mets’ Johan Santana was equally dominant, and after each starter exited after seven innings — Santana with nine strikeouts, Garcia with only one hit allowed — one could not help but think, “What an excellent pitchers’ duel. This is going to be a great finish.”
And it was. Eventually.
Terrific defense helped save the day in this one as well. 
The Cardinals loaded the bases with two out in the 10th inning before Matt Holliday lofted a foul pop-up towards the first-base stands. The Mets’ Alex Cora, hardly a first baseman by trade, jumped to catch the ball and landed in the seats, holding onto the ball to end the inning and lengthen highlight reels for years to come.
After the Mets scored in the 19th off the Cardinals’ second position player to pitch in the game, and the Cardinals tied it off the Mets’ closer, one could only sit in awe, agony, disbelief and, for true fans, excitement that a modern-day game was hitting the 20th inning. 
Even truer baseball fans appreciated that it was only 1–1. Once the Mets finally put the game away in the 20th, sighs of relief were all the rage.
Pitching and defense have been making a comeback, and never was it more present than on Saturday. The Mets are now one of three teams, along with the Padres and the Rays, that have never had a no-hitter thrown in team history. I’m still waiting — eventually some team has to come out of a game hitless at the hands of the Mets.
After all, as Danny Ozark once said, “Even Napoleon had his Watergate.”

For many people, Ultimate Frisbee is a rather unknown sport. While the sport may not be as popular as football or basketball, Ultimate players are motivated and extremely hardworking. Carnegie Mellon boasts a pioneering program that has been around since 1975, when only a handful of teams existed in the nation. Competition for Ultimate Frisbee is structured in a tournament style, usually held on the weekends at various locations within the region that the team belongs to. The Ultimate players maintain a rigorous training regime, incorporating team practices with running and weightlifting workouts each week. Managing academics, practice, and traveling can be difficult, but the extra effort is worth it. Although many Ultimate players play Frisbee for the first time upon coming to college, the team consists of athletes from all sports backgrounds.
For first-year human-computer interaction graduate student Jeremy Kanter, Ultimate Frisbee has been both a challenging and rewarding experience. Finishing in fifth place in a tough section this year, Kanter pointed out that the Ultimate team has sights set on battling for a higher place in seasons to come. “Our style now is predicated on hard work, speed, and aggressive defense,” he said. “We’ve got a lot of good young players, all pure athletes, and it’s only a matter of time until we’re back to making regionals regularly.”

Prejudice is an issue we have faced time and time again. In the media today, we often witness how movies, television shows, and music fortify and proliferate negative stereotypes, stereotypes that have caught the eyes and ears of human-rights groups constantly throughout the past century.
For years, people have pondered the origins of prejudice and have often only resorted to speculation. Recent studies, however, have suggested a new alternative that suggests that prejudice and racial stereotyping might, in fact, be genetic. Children with a genetic condition known as Williams Syndrome do not display the tendency to stereotype other people based on their race, a tendency that most children have from a very early age.
Previous studies have shown the presence of racial stereotypes to be prevalent in children as early as age three, to the same extent that these stereotypes are present in adults. Additionally, racial stereotyping has been found to be present in children with autism who have difficulties in social interaction and the development of social knowledge. However, according to www.labspaces.net, in this new study by Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg of the Central Institute of Mental Health, Mannheim and the University of Heidelberg in Germany, researchers showed children a series of pictures having people of different races and genders, and asked the children to assign positive or negative features to them. Typical children made strong stereotypical assignments for gender roles as well as for race, which was similar to results of older studies. However, in children with Williams Syndrome, almost no evidence of racial bias whatsoever was found.
Williams Syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by deletions of about 26 genes from the long arm of chromosome seven. Children with Williams Syndrome are known to have unusually friendly natures because they lack the sense of fear that other people feel in various social situations. As this is the case, the findings in this new study support the notion that prejudice and racial stereotyping may be the result of social fear.
In the past century, scientists have made great advances into the understanding of prejudice, its causes, and ways to change and prevent it. According to Social Psychology, prejudice, from a psychologist’s standpoint, is a hostile or negative attitude toward a distinguishable group of people. When looking at prejudice as an attitude, it is important to consider its different levels. Even though we look down upon its explicit level, which is when individuals consciously show their thoughts, feelings, and actions, we often overlook its implicit level, which is involuntary, uncontrollable, and at times unconscious. It is this implicit level of prejudice we may more commonly experience and must work harder to change.
The most prominent method used to reduce racial prejudice is to bring members from various different groups together and put them in a situation where they must rely on each other to achieve a common goal. There is an extensive amount of both formal and informal contact among the members, and there is equal status and social norms of equality among the members. Various techniques, including the jigsaw classroom — a teaching technique that places students of different genders and ethnicities into groups — incorporate these ideas to combat prejudice from an early age.
From the study’s findings, however, researchers hope to find ways to develop new means of intervention designed to reduce discriminatory attitudes and behavior towards marginalized or vulnerable groups. “This is the first study to report the absence of racial stereotypes in any human population,” said Meyer-Lindenberg. As this is the case, the findings in this study may open a gateway into both genetic research and social psychology that may revolutionize our approach in combating prejudice by confronting the issue on multiple levels.

The ability to combine animals is an idea common to mythology in many cultures. The best elements of each animal were taken, forming a novel creature usually more powerful than its constituents. This type of animal was given the name “chimera.” For example, the griffin, a combination of a lion and an eagle — both kings of their domains — was a legendary symbol of divine power. The pincoy is a combination of a man and a sea lion that brings fertility to the sea.
Although mythological chimeras do not exist, researchers have been able to combine features of animals using modern genetic technology. Animal chimeras are formed when zygotes of different animals are mixed and allowed to develop within a carrier organism.
This ability arises from our understanding of organism development. After an egg is fertilized, cell division occurs until a large number of cells are created. However, these cells are all the same, and have not yet “chosen” a developmental path. This is to say that different cells will develop into different parts of the body; for example, some cells will develop into components of the digestive system, and others will develop into the brain. Before the cells “choose” a developmental path, scientists are able to replace some cells with cells from another animal, which also have not “chosen” their developmental path.
Chimeras have many uses in biological research. According to www.timesonline.co.uk, research under Yutaka Hanazano, a professor in the Division of Regenerative Medicine at Jichi Medical University in Japan, has been able to grow chimpanzee pancreas in sheep. Further development in this field may yield promising results with other organs, and Hanazano believes this research may one day allow sheep to become “organ banks” for humans who need transplants. His work was inspired by the lack of organ donors in Japan compared to other countries around the world.
Mouse chimeras are popular among biologists, and can be used to study cellular processes. In one instance, mouse chimeras were created with human brain cells, which allowed researchers to observe human neural development. Researchers were able to use these genetically engineered cells in mice as therapy to Tay-Sachs disease, a genetic disorder that causes mental deterioration, and ultimately death, in children. Cellular chimeras also exist, where scientists mix genomes of different organisms to produce a new cell with the desired traits. An article on www.nature.com stated that a viral chimera has been developed that combines the genomes of the common cold and the polio virus. Although this may sound like an attempt to create a supreme virus, the chimera can actually be useful for treating malignant glioma, the most common and fatal form of brain cancer. This kind of cancer cannot be removed surgically, and chemotherapy has proven to be ineffective. The chimera virus destroys malignant glioma, but does not cause polio. However, there is always the darker side to research. Chimeras may also have uses in biological warfare. According to www.howstuffworks.com, geneticists have been able to increase the potency of various infectious diseases, such as smallpox and anthrax. During the time of the Soviet Union, a high-ranking biological warfare expert considered combining smallbox and ebola into one virus. The possibilities are endless when it comes to chimeras. Diseases can be created that can remain dormant in the body until an external source triggers its activation.
Research with human chimeras is only in its beginnings, as work with human organs would require experimentation using human stem cells. The debate about the ethics of using human cells for experimentation is divided. However, chimera research has shown promising results and its research is important to our understanding of cellular processes.

A recent volcanic eruption in Iceland created mayhem, causing evacuations and widespread flooding in the country. Other parts of western Europe were affected as well, as volcanic ash grounded planes. While volcanic eruptions and ash become the center of the spotlight for breaking news, it is important to understand the nature behind the fearsome and destructive power of volcanoes.
Most humans will only see the surface of the earth, but thousands of kilometers of molten rock exist beneath our feet, under the solid ground on which we live. This molten rock is called magma, and it sometimes makes its way to the surface of the earth through volcanoes. The exit of magma can sometimes be forceful, resulting in a volcanic eruption.
Usually, magma exists as  solid rock, according to the website www.howstuffworks.com. This is because of the enormous pressure that exists under the earth’s surface, which prevents magma from becoming a fluid. However, there are occasions when magma can rise closer to the surface when pressure is released. This is explained by plate tectonics, a theory that the earth’s surface is composed of interlocking plates that move in the inner regions of the earth. Sometimes, the boundaries between these plates separate, allowing magma to rise between them. Other times, the plates will crash into each other such that the edges move downwards, which also forces magma to flow upwards between the plates.
The reason magma is forced upwards is a result of differences in density between the layers of the earth. When magma becomes more fluid, its density decreases relative to the rock by which it is surrounded. This is the same reason why helium balloons rise in air — the density of helium is less than that of air. Most magma eventually becomes trapped in magma chambers just below the earth’s surface, but some will find a way to the top.
Magma erupts because of the gases that become dissolved in it. Again, eruption has to do with pressure; once the confining pressure of surrounding rock becomes less than the escaping pressure of gas, the gas will erupt out of the earth’s surface and carry magma with it. The power of volcanic eruptions is dictated by the amount of gas in the magma, as well as how resistant the magma is to its gases escaping. If the magma has a higher resistance, more gas pressure can build up before it erupts, causing a stronger eruption.
A volcano describes any sort of opening on the earth’s surface through which magma or gases can erupt. While frequently associated with explosive eruptions, another common type of eruption forms effusive lava, which is slow moving.
The reason why Iceland’s volcano is causing so much trouble is because of the force of the volcanic eruption, which sent columns of ash into the air. Wind has scattered ash into the atmosphere of many countries in Western Europe, preventing planes from flying. In addition, according to www.guardian.co.uk, magma from the eruption also melted 200-meter thick glaciers, causing extensive flooding that tore down bridges, roads, and homes. Ash in the atmosphere reduced visibility to mere yards, and many people near the eruption had to evacuate their homes and find refuge in Red Cross shelters.
Although volcanoes are associated with fire and destruction, they play an important role in shaping the earth’s surface. They are involved with the creation of islands, and volcanic rocks add nutrients to soil.

Natural particle accelerator found
CERN’s Large Hadron Collider has been gaining distinction as the most powerful particle accelerator created by man, but what about those formed by Mother Nature? At the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, researchers have discovered that during thunderstorms, particle accelerators can be created in thunderclouds. The existence of these natural particle accelerators has been theorized since 1925, but they were only recently detected by the radio waves they emitted.
The earth is constantly bombarded by high-energy particles from space in the form of cosmic rays. These can remove electrons from molecules in the air. Free electrons can then be accelerated upwards when they interact with the electric field from lightning. When many of these electrons accelerate upward, they form a sort of particle beam that traverses many atmospheric layers. The energy from a nuclear power plant would be needed to generate such a beam artificially. Scientists are worried that these electrons may be harmful to orbiting satellites.

Scientists battle genetic disease
By transferring DNA between eggs, researchers have managed to prevent genetic diseases involving mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria are parts of all cells that create energy for the cell to use.
Under the direction of Shoukhrat Mitalipov of the Oregon National Primate Research Center in Beaverton, researchers performed experiments on rhesus monkeys, removing the cell nucleus from one egg and replacing it with the cell nucleus of another egg. By doing so, they did not have to transfer any of the other cellular components between the eggs, which includes mitochondrial DNA.
This discovery can be significant in medical research, since defects in mitochondrial DNA have been linked to diseases such as diabetes. Researchers believe that one out of every 200 births is somehow affected by mitochondrial DNA mutations. Before tests can be performed on humans, ethical concerns and regulations on human egg experimentation must be addressed.

Study reveals how brain multitasks
A French research group has discovered that multitasking causes the brain to split into two halves, with each half focusing on one task. They monitored brain activity in a group of participants who were told to perform a certain task. When only one task was being done, one side of the frontal lobe showed activity. When two tasks were being performed, both sides of the frontal lobe were active.
This may explain why multitasking is a difficult process for the brain, or why performing more than two tasks at a time causes one task to be forgotten. When subjects had to perform more than two tasks, their accuracy decreased. The study may also explain why choosing from a long list of items may cause irrational decisions, because the brain forgets about earlier items as it reads new ones.

This year, Carnival once again boasted the usual elaborately designed booths and, as a result, Midway showcased some of Carnegie Mellon’s most creative work. With booth designs ranging from a never-ending ice age to a world in which the Pittsburgh Pirates actually win games, the booths aptly reflected this year’s theme — “History With A Twist.”
In spite of some setbacks due to rain showers on Friday and cold weather all Saturday, Midway still attracted a throng of students, faculty, and other Pittsburghers. Judging took place on Friday, and the winners were announced at the awards ceremony on Saturday afternoon.
In the fraternity category, Phi Kappa Theta’s booth, “RoboRome,” took first place. The members of Phi Kappa Theta had clearly paid attention to detail while building the booth, as the entire exterior was covered in small, carefully placed mirrors. Phi Kappa Theta also earned the Chairman’s Choice Award.
Sigma Phi Epsilon’s “If The Y2K Happened” won the second prize for fraternities. With its life-size circuit boards and giant Gmail chat lists displaying the names of the fraternity members, this extremely Carnegie Mellon-esque booth dazzled viewers with its every aspect. The booth also sported a mock Facebook profile page that displayed visitors’ pictures where the profile picture usually appears. With something interesting on every wall, this Y2K booth was both witty and well designed.
Alpha Epsilon Pi’s “Pittsburgh Wins the World Series” won the third prize. This booth was a parody of the Pittsburgh Pirates, including a Hall of Fame for the Pirates with a golden cup and glove. The booth also included a spectacularly fun baseball game, complete with scoreboard and an enthusiastic digital audience. This theme was clearly a favorite with Pittsburghers and earned many laughs.
In the sorority category, Kappa Alpha Theta’s “Hanging Gardens of Babylon” earned first place. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this booth was the three-story-tall waterfall that spanned most of the exterior. The interior of the booth was filled with plants and beautifully constructed pillars, lending the booth a sense of mystery that made it extremely popular with the crowd. It won the People’s Choice Award.
Kappa Kappa Gamma’s “If the Ice Age Never Ended” won second place in the sorority category. The booth showcased pictures of everyday scenes and famous places modified to reflect a perpetual ice age, and it was a great display of innovation and wit. One of the most notable of these pictures was that of the Egyptian Sphinx, which the girls of Kappa Kappa Gamma made of ice instead of sand.
The third-place prize went to Alpha Chi Omega’s Agrabah-themed booth. The large golden domes of the booth made it extremely noticeable and helped attract a large crowd. Inside the booth was an Agrabah market, complete with fake swords, heaps of watermelon, fake fish, and other goods that made this booth a treat for all. As Rebecca Jacobs, an Alpha Chi Omega sister and sophomore psychology and Spanish major, put it, “[The theme of our booth] is something that both kids and adults can enjoy.”
Appealing to a large audience, the Taiwanese Student Association’s (TSA) booth won first place in the independent category. Called “An Adventure For Those Who Seek To Find A Way To Leave CMU Behind,” the booth had the public navigate its way through a Jumanji game board. Johnson Pun, a sophomore architecture major and Booth co-chair for TSA, said that the group likes doing “anything out of the ordinary,” and this led the members to choose their theme. The booth was certainly unique, with intricately designed statues within the booth and a host of enormous jungle animals and insects crawling up the exterior of the booth. TSA also won the Environmental Award, an award recognizing creative use of materials for building, use of environmentally friendly building materials, and the ease and safety of disposal of the booth.
The Asian Student Association (ASA) won second place in the independent category for “SuperBooth: Marvel Warfare!” A tribute to some of the all-time most popular superheroes, this booth was a chapter straight out of the comic books. The painting done in the booth was especially astounding and adhered well to the overall theme of the booth. Donald Chow, a sophomore architecture major and one of the booth chairs for ASA, said that the group wanted the booth to “appeal to little kids” and that was the “main focus” of the booth.
The third place in the independent category went to the Singapore Students Association’s booth based on George Orwell’s book 1984.
The final category of awards was for the blitz booths. The first prize went to the Archibooth, titled “…In a box.” The second prize went to Mudge House’s “Fishy Evolution,” and the third prize went to Stever House’s “John Wilkes Booth.”
Although it was not a competitive booth, a booth worth mentioning is the Entertainment Technology Center’s (ETC) “The ImininTech Project.” This was the first year that the ETC built a booth. Using up two booth spaces, “The ImininTech Project” attracted a large amount of people, with the line to the booth snaking almost all the way across Midway. This booth was far different from the conventional ones, as it was designed to be an interactive experience that had the public participating all the way through. Five to seven people were let inside “ImininTech” at a time and were guided through the “lab facility” by so-called members of the lab. What ensued was a lab accident that required the viewers to flee one room of the facility, enter another where bugs had to be killed by stomping on a touchscreen in the floor, and finally enter another chamber where the audience was “detoxified” by being shaken on a moving platform.
The entire concept of this booth, along with the electronics used, made it standout among all the other booths. Michael Campbell, a master’s student in the ETC and co-producer of the ImininTech project, explained that after the ETC showcased “Get In Line” during last year’s Carnival and received a favorable response, they decided to move on to something bigger. “[We thought,] why don’t we join in the fun and make a booth?” Campbell said. The team behind the project consisted of nine students and two faculty advisors. Campbell hoped that ETC would be able to continue this tradition and next year build something of a similar, if not better, caliber.
Although the final results were impressive, the initial process of building the booths was not without major obstacles. For Jacobs and her sorority, “building the domes and columns [of the Agrabah booth] was a major challenge.” For both Chow and Pun, the biggest difficulty  was learning to cooperate as a group with such a large variety of people. As Pun said, “[It was a challenge] making sure that everyone was happy with the end result.” In the end, however, the groups managed to overcome these challenges and help make Carnival a success, as always.

Friday was the start of the 91st annual Sweepstakes competition, one of Carnegie Mellon’s unique traditions. Sweepstakes — or Buggy, as it is more commonly known — brings together both Greek houses and independent organizations in a combination of engineering and athleticism. Teams build small racing vehicles, known as buggies, that are pushed and driven around a 0.9-mile course between Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall and Schenley Park.
This year’s rolls were punctuated by numerous mechanical problems, logistical difficulties, and surprising disqualifications on both days. The final result after Saturday’s finals had Fringe taking the top spot in both the men’s and women’s races.
More than 50 teams took to the course during preliminary rounds Friday, a day marked by numerous mechanical problems and disqualifications. In total, eight teams failed to cross the finish line, and three were granted re-rolls after problems in their initial races.
Problems began early, as the women’s heats saw two disqualifications and three spinouts. In the seventh heat, spinouts claimed both the SPIRIT C and Sigma Phi Epsilon (Sig Ep) A women’s buggies, leaving Student Dormitory Council (SDC) A to finish the race alone. SPIRIT in particular had a tough morning, as only one of the group’s three women’s teams crossed the finish line. The surviving A team finished eighth with a time of 2:55.17. Overall, the group’s buggies lost three wheels in various Friday heats.
Kory McDonald, SPIRIT Buggy chair and junior mechanical engineering major, explained that SPIRIT was “working on new things and trying to push the limit this year.” “Unfortunately,” he said, “some things didn’t come together in the end. What we saw in practice just didn’t come through on race day.”
“It’s kind of sad,” said Richard Halstead, a master’s student in electrical and computer engineering who pushes for the CIA B men’s team, “because they used to be really competitive — and their teams still are, I think — but they seem to consistently screw up on the freeroll.”
The CIA women’s teams also suffered from logistical problems. The A team was disqualified for having an apparent pacer alongside the course. The B team did not complete its race when the team’s flagger signaled driver and junior architecture major Annemarie Malbon to stop following the SPIRIT B crash. The team was granted a re-roll on Saturday and finished with a time of 3:31.58.
“I guess the women’s heats did go pretty badly. Usually there’s only one or two crashes per day,” Halstead said.
The top of the women’s leader board ended Friday with familiar faces. SDC, the first organization to field four women’s teams, advanced all four of them into the top 10. SDC A took the top spot with a time of 2:28.14. Behind them, the Fringe A team cut nine seconds off its 2009 time to finish in second place at 2:39.49. SDC B, though the team lost some time from last year, rounded out the top three at 2:42.07. Also advancing to Saturday’s final rounds were Fringe B at 2:48.23, SDC C at 2:48.31, and Pi Kappa Alpha (PiKA) A at 2:51.11.
The more numerous men’s heats had their share of difficulties as well. PiKA D was disqualified due to interference at the beginning of the heat against Sig Ep A. Later, an impact between SDC C and PiKA A led to a disqualification for SDC C on the basis of reckless driving following an unintentional collision. SPIRIT’s men’s teams again suffered mechanical problems, as both the A and C teams’ buggies spun out in the Chute — the fast turn from Schenley Drive onto Frew Street — and did not finish their races. Sigma Nu B also did not complete its race due to a spinout.
Racing in the final heat of the prelims, SDC A driver and senior English major Michelle Mirabella fishtailed on her turn into the Chute, but quick work by pushers Devin Murray, a senior mechanical engineering major; Evan Korol, a junior philosophy, statistics, and SHS student; and Casey Piper, a junior H&SS interdisciplinary student, on Hills 3 through 5 still scored the team a first-place finish for the day. SDC A’s preliminary time of 2:04.61 left them two seconds ahead of the nearest competition, Fringe A, and missed the all-time course record, set by the same team last year, by 1.31 seconds. Fringe A (2:06.55) and SDC B (2:07.85) rounded out the men’s top three. Sig Ep A, PiKA A, PiKA B, Fringe C, Fringe B, Sig Ep B, and Sigma Nu A also advanced to Saturday’s finals.
Teams in the final races Saturday morning faced cold and gray weather, with temperatures in the mid-40s after a drop of nearly 30 degrees from the previous day. The colder temperatures meant a much smaller crowd than usual for Buggy finals races. “The energy level is a lot lower because it’s dreary and cold,” said Sara Wingen, a senior psychology major and pusher for Fringe A. The weather also hindered the teams’ performances during races. “The weather definitely affected the speeds and times that we saw,” McDonald commented.
The day also started with a major upset: SDC, the leading contender for both the men’s and women’s races, was disqualified from competition for violation of a safety code. Julian Kessler, the organization’s Buggy chair, announced in a short statement that all SDC teams had been disqualified after a fire marshal noticed a propane tank in or near the organization’s truck. Sweepstakes head judge Andrew Hundt declared the group ineligible for competition Saturday.
With SDC out of the race, the field was left wide open for the other contenders. Only three of the six women’s teams remained in the finals. Fringe and PiKA became the two remaining contenders in the second day of races, with Fringe A taking the top spot with a time of 2:40.59, and PiKA A coming in second with a time of 2:47.38. Fringe B rounded out the women’s races, finishing a close third at 2:48.53.
The men’s races also saw significant changes in the leader board, with the two SDC teams eliminated from a total of 10. Fringe A finished in first place with a time of 2:07.50. Sig Ep A came in second with a time of 2:11.22, and Fringe B took third in 2:16.32. Fringe C followed in fourth place at 2:17.56, and PiKA A came in fifth at 2:27.35. PiKA B finished with a time of 2:16.32, but was disqualified for its Hill 5 pusher not grabbing the push bar when crossing the finish line. Sigma Nu A finished with a time of 2:19.82, but was disqualified following a loss of mass when the buggy’s left wheel cover came off in the Chute. Sig Ep B finished with a time of 2:20.30, but was disqualified following a loss of mass on Hill 3, where half of the buggy’s handlebar broke off.
Although the weather had an impact on attendance and crowd excitement during the final races this year, there were still many lighthearted moments. The exhibition races at the start of the day saw many alumni in a spirited mood as they re-took their previous roles as buggy pushers and drivers. Sigma Nu’s class of 1985 cheered as they celebrated victory in their 1985 grudge match against PiKA.
Others at the races also commented on having a good time. “Buggy embodies all that is amazing about CMU. You take something simple and put CMU students on it, and it becomes absolutely amazing and ridiculous,” 2008 CIT alumnus Doug Robl said. “It has something for everyone,” said civil engineering master’s student Mary Ashe, a pusher for SDC. “It’s nerdy and athletic and has a little bit of everything. It’s a great thing to be a part of.” McDonald added, “It’s an awesome combination of invention, collaboration, and innovation, and a great show of school spirit.”

No Carnival event showcases Carnegie Mellon’s nerd pride more than the Mobot (mobile robot) Races. It is a festival of motherboards, switches, gears, and glasses, where brains reign supreme and hard work pays off. The 16th annual Mobot Races were a great display of mechanical innovation and programming ingenuity.
The rules of Mobot are simple. Rain or shine, each robot must travel a 255-foot slalom course marked by a white line on the sidewalk in front of Wean Hall, passing through 15 gates in order along the way. The robot that reaches the farthest gate with the best time is the winner and receives a $1000 prize. The second-place winner receives $500, and the third-place winner receives $250. The majority of the robots were created by undergraduate students, and others competed in the exhibition and open sections.
The minutes leading up to the first race were tense. All the teams were making final adjustments: checking to see if their robots actually followed the line, detaching and reattaching wires to various circuit boards, and walking their robots purposefully down the hill with laptops in hand. There were groans, and even a yelp from the team cautiously sticking a screwdriver into a mess of wires. And as the wind picked up, the race was ready to begin.
Of course, as at many Carnegie Mellon events, there were a few curious participants. Greg Armstrong, a senior research technician in the Robotics Institute, came out of Wean Hall in a plaid kilt and toga, wielding an enormous sword. During the races, he strolled up the walkway, glancing at each mobot, waving his sword in the air, and every so often shouting things like “Those aren’t Legos!” and “Get your mobots ready!” In the background, Red Robot, the Robotics Club’s human-sized robot mascot, wandered the field playing Daft Punk’s “Technologic” and dancing with children and students. A couple of people on pogo-stilts walked by nonchalantly.
The area surrounding the pit stop where the mobots were being adjusted began to fill up with fans, all eager to see exactly what sort of bizarre machines would be at the event this year. The crowd was made up of students, children, alumni, and professors.
There are many different approaches to completing the Mobot course. Almost all involve following the thin white line that winds through the gates and down the hill. The robots usually use a sensor array attached to their undersides to direct their steering, while an independent motor pushes them forward. Once the mobots go off track, their chances of coming back are slim to none. The record for the course is an astounding 33.99 seconds, or 7.5 feet per second, set by two Carnegie Mellon robotics staff members, Michael Licitra and Jeff McMahill, in 2009.
This year, there were several different interesting constructions. One mobot, named Jiggyfly, was made with a few sheets of looseleaf paper, a block of wood, and a hacked Game Boy. Another, named Stingray, was a triangle with a few wheels sticking out, completely covered in black duct tape. And finally, Alpha Epsilon Pi’s robot used a camera and a netbook and seemed to track the line in front of it and adjust its path that way.
Each of the 15 robots were placed at the starting points, switched on, and let run. Some began extremely quickly and were loudly cheered on, while others left the starting point at a snail’s pace. All the mobots completed the first gate, following the line almost exactly, but many couldn’t handle the pressure when they began to descend the hill. The few who made it past the first hill managed to complete the majority of the course. Those who successfully stayed on track down the second hill had to struggle through a hodgepodge of crossing lines at the end of the course.
In the end, AEPi’s robot was this year’s undergraduate champion, passing through all 15 gates in a time of 1:17.20. The robot, created by first-year computer science major Nathanial Barshay, was able to travel in a smoother trajectory because it wasn’t adjusting every single time it slightly deviated from the line. The winner of the open class section, Megubot, was created by C-MITES students Megan and Terry McKelvey. It used sensor arrays to control both acceleration and direction but couldn’t get down the second hill.
Second place in the undergraduate category was team Zoidberg, made up of computer science junior Jake Poznanski and mathematical sciences junior Itai Stein. The robot completed eight gates with a time of 1:19.69. In third place was Stingray, created by electrical and computer engineering sophomore Kwabena Walden Agyeman, also completing eight gates, but with a slower time of 1:41.95. Megubot won both the judges’ choice and also the open section, completing nine gates in 2:27.44.
Mobot is a tradition that in many ways defines the interdisciplinary approach Carnegie Mellon strives towards. In the future, we can expect many more cardboard cyborgs, armed and kilted Scotsmen, and — most of all — clever and innovative robots.

With the group’s annual Carnival performance this year, Scotch’n’Soda put on “the perfect con,” which, according to director Alex DiClaudio, is synonymous with succeeding at putting on a good bit of theater and getting paid to do so.
This year’s play, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, showcased the acting and singing talents of the Scotch’n’Soda cast. The performance featured most of the win-win elements the theater group usually employs: strong voices, catchy numbers, great acting, and a hilarious plotline.
The story followed the tale of two conmen: Lawrence (played by senior music major Scott Wasserman) and Freddy (sophomore music major Sean Pack), who are brought together by Freddy’s desire to be tutored by the more experienced Lawrence and earn “great big stuff.” Lawrence rakes in the cash by following a straightforward routine: find a wealthy woman traveling alone in France, woo her by pretending to be a prince, and then take her money by acting helpless and without funds to support an ongoing war.
While not central to the plot, one of the highlights of the play was the scene in which Lawrence coaches Freddy by asking him to observe as he woos a Ms. Jolene Oaks from Oklahoma (senior BHA creative enterprise management major Shannon Deep). Deep’s performance as Jolene, complete with her loud accent and a rhinestone-studded pink cowboy hat over blond curls, was powerful. She took the stage by storm during the “Oklahoma!” number, firing imaginary bullets in the air as she danced and sang.
Pack’s performance also deserves special mention. When Lawrence’s plans with Jolene fall through, Freddy comes to his rescue by pretending to be Lawrence’s mentally disabled younger brother Ruprecht. In what can only be described as a mildly disgusting performance, Freddy succeeds in scaring Jolene away with his obscene gestures and repulsive habits — actions that Pack performed remarkably, much to the delight and distaste of the audience.
The contrast between Lawrence’s stuffy, poised demeanor and Freddy’s vulgar, energetic personality is interesting to watch. This comparison is highlighted when they begin to compete against each other, testing who can con the innocent Christine (sophomore music major Gillian Hassert) first. Hassert also shone during the performance, impressing the audience with her strong vocal skills.
As Lawrence and Freddy compete, they depict the underlying frustration between greed and morals that they face as they go through with their sneaky plans. When Lawrence discovers that Christine is not really wealthy, he feels guilty and, realizing how noble she is, even starts having feelings for her. Freddy, on the other hand, is late in hearing the call of his conscience.
Providing additional comedy were Lawrence’s sidekick Andre (BHA student Steven Tietjen) and a victim of Lawrence’s cons Muriel (senior music major Melissa Johnson). Andre and Muriel’s parallel love story provided much laughter. Tietjen’s impeccable French accent was a source of much of the hilarity.
The supporting cast entertained well with choreographed dance numbers and also provided strong vocal support for the lead singers. The actors shuffled among playing the roles of butlers and French maids, ticket checkers, sailors, and tourists. 
Wasserman, also the artistic director of Scotch’n’Soda, was particularly impressive in the ease with which he transitioned from an American con artist to a German psychiatrist. His thick German accent, complete with yodels when he sang, was simultaneously hilarious and surprising.
With a surprise ending, Scotch’n’Soda succeeded in raising the audience members to their feet at the end of another great show.

Thursday night, students rushed to fill seats under the main stage tent at Midway. Once every seat was taken, those in the crowd unable to find a folding chair lined the edges of the tent to peer at the stage. Munching on fried Oreos and clumps of funnel cake, the audience settled into their seats and poised their cell phone cameras in preparation for the appearance of Michael Ian Black and Michael Showalter and their comedy act.
Surprisingly, a fair amount of education came before the laughs. Black and Showalter entered the stage amid cheers, and began imparting their vast knowledge about the history of Carnegie Mellon. “You know, the original name was Andrew Carnegie’s Honeydew Mellon,” one of the comedians informed the crowd.
Aside from their knowledge of the agricultural roots of our university, they seemed to have done their research on the traditions of Carnival as well. Black shared his ideas for a booth theme. “Trench warfare, the Irish Potato Famine... what would you do in your booth? Starve?” he asked.
Black’s definition of Buggy was short, sweet, and far clearer than that of many Carnegie Mellon students themselves. With a deadpan face he said, simply: “Buggy is: You build a buggy, you race it, you win.”
They also shared a little-explored perspective on the gender relations behind Buggy. “This has to be the most misogynistic sport. Ever,” Black sighed and said. “You put a girl in a buggy and shove it down a hill.”
Early on in the show, Black revealed that he was a reader of The Tartan, which he accused of being both severely unfunny and the most intelligent paper he has ever read. Backhanded compliments aside, Showalter had a personal experience concerning the paper to share: “I get Tartan on my teeth sometimes.”
The act soon turned away from Carnegie Mellon themes to disappointing Halloween costumes, holiday reindeer sweaters, and games of Jeopardy! and Scrabble. Several awkward topics led to equally awkward silences and nervous chuckles from the audience, but for the most part, the comedians’ humor seemed to hit its mark. 
Black and Showalter’s unique style of comedy seems to have a selective fan base: Either you got it and laughed your head off or you sat in confused silence. Judging from the noise level of the laughter throughout the show, those who found the pair hilarious made up most of the audience. Many of those present were fans of their show on Comedy Central and Stella, as well as Black’s work in VH1’s I Love The… series.
However, audience members not so well-acquainted with their style of humor were not so impressed. “I think it was too forced.... They took jokes too far that should’ve stopped a long time ago,” first-year professional writing major Jordan Stephenson said with a shrug. “It was really funny at times, though.”
Though Black and Showalter may not have found a new fan in every member of the audience, by request of the crowd they continued their act past its closing time by improvising dramatic movie scenes to random songs on Showalter’s iTunes album. The show ended, as it began, on the subject of Carnival.
“Go, Roy!” Black yelled to his non-existent, water-painting rebel of a son. “Take your beat-up ol’ pickup, and don’t you ever come back! Carnegie Mellon,” he yelled, amid cheers from the audience, “Go! Go enjoy your Carnival, and never, ever, ever come back!”

Over the years, Carnegie Mellon’s Carnival has hosted a plethora of big names. From The Shins in 2005 to last year’s rave-review performance by The New Pornographers, when it comes to the Carnival concert, the Carnegie Mellon Activities Board never fails to deliver. This year was certainly no exception when AB brought mewithoutYou and The Black Keys to our campus.
Although the location of the concert was moved from the CFA Lawn to Wiegand Gym due to impending rain, the Carnival concert crowd was by no means lacking energy. With 250 last-minute tickets being handed out to concertgoers, Wiegand quickly filled with eager fans. The audience, however, was not limited to Carnegie Mellon students — several outsiders, whether they were students from nearby schools or just local fans, rushed to find their means of admittance.
When it was time for the opening band, mewithoutYou, to take the stage, the crowd had grown somewhat impatient, chanting “Let them play!” until the very second the lights dimmed. With that change of lighting, however, came a roar of excitement so strong that one could have mistaken Wiegand Gym for Heinz Hall.
Philadelphia natives Aaron and Michael Weiss formed what would soon become mewithoutYou in the late ’90s, and since then, the band has enjoyed a consistent run of popularity. Having released two EPs and four albums, and having graced the bills of several big-name music festivals, the members of mewithoutYou are no strangers to the spotlight.
Soon after taking the stage here at Carnegie Mellon, the guys of mewithoutYou began a flawless set with classic tracks from their earlier albums as well as some newer tunes. The band sent the Carnegie Mellon crowd into chaos — crowd surfers began exploding from the sea of listeners toward the middle of the crowd. This started what can be considered the closest Carnegie Mellon will ever get to having a mosh pit.
After mewithoutYou came the highly anticipated headliners, The Black Keys. Though any fan of the band would know, this tiny two-person group is often praised for its huge sound. This effect, however, is so much greater when seeing the band perform live — it’s incredible to imagine such a large sound coming from only two men.
Much like the members of mewithoutYou, Dan Auerbach and Partick Carney of The Black Keys have enjoyed a long run with fame. Having released a total of eight albums, including their most recent 2010 release Brothers, the band not only performed its newer songs, but also those popular classics like “Strange Desire” from earlier releases.
Overall, the Carnival concert was yet again a huge success for both the coordinators of the AB Concerts committee and the Carnegie Mellon community. With the reputation of our spring Carnival concert exceeding itself each year, we can only hope for further amazing concerts in the future.

For this year’s Spring Carnival, many students and alumni geared up for the Black Keys concert on Friday night in Wiegand Gym. Although this was the main advertised musical event, the side stage student-run concerts were hugely successful and deserved more buzz than just the casual Facebook invite. Usually, listeners have to grin and bear it when they attend their friend’s band’s concert or amateur musical event and praise them no matter the quality of their performance. This, however, was not the case with the performers at this year’s Carnival side stage performances.
Last Thursday, in the Kraus Campo connecting CFA to Tepper, student band Monsters! performed for the CFA Beaux Arts Ball, an underground party in celebration of Carnival, and recruited quite an audience. This band consists of Alex Weston, a junior music major, on piano and vocals; Andrew Harrison, also a junior music major, on trumpet; Terence Einhorn, a sophomore social and decision science major, on saxophone; Zack Armentrout, a junior mathematical science major, on the drums; and postdoctoral fellow Dave Conner on bass.
The music played was perfect for the atmosphere, and the musical talent brought forward by our peers was incredible. What is great about Monsters! is the sax and trumpet, which bring individuality and jazz tonality to the music and make the group stand out among other student bands. The music played live at the CFA Beaux Arts Ball really kicked off the party right. The live music, quirky DJs, and favorable weather made partygoers want to stay out all night and forget about school re-starting soon after the weekend.
Last Saturday, in the Midway side tent, A Place in the Sun performed for a short while for all the Booth visitors and Carnival attendees. Although it ended up being a frigid day, students bundled up and trekked out to see their peers perform. The band is composed of Duquesne University students Darren Diederich on vocals and guitar, Derek Cavaliero on guitar, Matt Sonnega on the drums, and Carnegie Mellon senior electrical and chemical engineering major Warren Pryde on bass. The music was a nice addition to the Carnival atmosphere, and while sitting in the audience was a little cold, being there to support fellow students was a great way to get into the Carnival mood.
After the A Place in the Sun performance, the Tim Ruff Trio played at the main Midway tent. Senior music major Tim Ruff performed with his band made up of sophomore social and decision science major Terence Einhorn on sax, junior social and decision science major Evan Halikias on drums, and senior English major Nathan Zoob on lead guitar. The group managed to draw a crowd in the last hours of Friday evening.
Watching these student bands was a very inspiring experience for anyone who went. These students are using their talents to spread music and unite the campus community while simultaneously doing something that they are truly passionate about, and that is what Carnival is all about.

Once upon a time, sweet dough was poured into a pan of hot oil, fried, and sprinkled with sugar on top — and dessert history was made. Ever since then, students have been drizzling batter and frying the same treats to satisfy the entire Carnegie Mellon community.
It’s fried, it’s sweet, and it’s not even breakfast.
Although it could be breakfast. It doesn’t matter what time it is, breakfast is the first meal of the day. At Carnegie Mellon, we eat timely. We fetch a La Prima coffee and croissant at 11:32 a.m. while running late for class, grab an Asiana bowl at 4 p.m. for lunch, and then order Little Nipper’s Pizza at 10 p.m. For Carnival-goers this weekend, Midway treats were a delicious addition to our usual meal plan.
Whatever your college-eating philosophy is, we can all agree on one thing — mid-April is the time for funnel cake and fried Oreos. Funnel cake — pale or deep gold in color, depending on who makes it — lures everyone who walks onto Midway. Even if you don’t see the Alpha Phi Omega booth, you can smell that delicious scent in the air. Around every corner are Carnival-goers eating fried treats, and you can be sure that they intend to finish them.
Funnel cakes and fried Oreos are full of psychological health benefits. The fried carbohydrates call to you, dusted sweetly with powdered sugar. After a while, the steam turns the powder into delicious sugary clumps that really stick to the dough. These typical Carnival treats are delicious Carnival usuals.
Regardless of the weather, the Alpha Phi Omega booth will always stand. Alpha Phi Omega is a national service fraternity that organizes fundraising events throughout the year. With the Carnival opening ceremony last Friday, the Alpha Phi Omega booth opened for business as well.
The roof of the Alpha Phi Omega booth experienced a few rain leaks this year because of tears in the tar paper on the roof. The electronics, ranging from a huge stand mixer to deep fryers and grills, were safe. The brothers were able to quickly fix the leaks in the rooftop. By last Saturday, the booth was once again ready for the afternoon forecast.
While funnel cakes and fried Oreos are Carnival classics, the booth also featured some unconventional Carnival treats. Along with pretzels and drinks, Alpha Phi Omega prepared ice cream because of its popularity from last year, but the Pittsburgh weather was not too considerate of the investment. Hamburgers and cheeseburgers were new to this year’s Carnival. Pizza, however, was taken off the Carnival menu.
The planning of next year’s Carnival starts right after this year’s celebration ends. For Carnival 2011, the Carnival Committee will meet together to decide the menu. Xiaojing Zhu, a senior in business administration and the purchasing chair of Carnival 2010, explained that the committee goes over what food worked and what food didn’t work. The committee then decides what changes should be made. Early in the spring, next year’s menu is finalized.
As for the booth design, Alpha Phi Omega always tries to make the construction as simple as possible, making the booth easy to set up and tear down. Every year, the booth is made ready for rain or snow, and the roof is lined with tar paper to prevent leaking.
This year, Alpha Phi Omega started to build the booth after Move-On and finished the construction in one day. The simple design made everything straightforward for the team. Even with some modification, most people knew the general construction of the concession stand.
On Wednesday, Alpha Phi Omega rented a U-Haul truck to transport food from various stores to the booth. With multiple refrigerators, the members of Alpha Phi Omega could store their food in their booth.
For each day of Carnival, Alpha Phi Omega started setup two hours before Midway opened. During the early morning, while the majority of the campus was watching Buggy, Alpha Phi Omega started to warm up the oil for funnel cake, the boiling water for hot dogs, and the grills for the hamburgers and cheeseburgers.
As the days went by, the number of staff members varied depending on the expected consumer traffic. This year, the booth doors really came to good use by keeping heat from the ovens and fryers confined to the booth.
Unlike the other booths, the Alpha Phi Omega concession stand needed a full staff to run. However, the members’ hard work did not go unrewarded. For Alpha Phi Omega, money raised during Carnival is the major source of funding for the group’s yearly service project. For those participating, Carnival is cooking, eating, and raising money, all at the same time.

The long-awaited spring is here, but who thought getting ready for class could be any harder? Nothing seems good enough, not for Carnival at least, and everyone wants to be up to date with the current fashion trends. Here is a rundown on the hottest spring fashions to make your outfit decisions a little bit easier.
**Short shorts **
As the temperatures are rising, so is the popularity of these hot shorts — smaller than ever. Whether they are high-waisted, frayed, threaded, detailed, or distressed-washed, all kinds are welcomed.
**One-pieces **
The words “jumper” and “romper” are both synonymous with this creative outfit. This is one of the most popular items of clothing for this season. Add prints, bustiers, or ruffles, a little twist and turn, and you just found yourself a great, simple outfit.
Sheer fabric 
Peek-a-boo! Add a little lace or tulle fabric to your outfit this spring. Perfect for the weather, these fabrics and details are flirty and cute, and they lighten up your entire outfit.
Metallics 
Now you can dress in all the glam, glitter, and sparkle you want, and it fits the fashion trend. Glam it up from head to toe with metallic clothing accessories. If you think you are not bold enough to work that metallic-toned dress, try wearing funky shoes and a big necklace, or carry a bag with a hint of glitter and sparkle.
Exposed backs 
Open your closet, search for anything with an open back, and use it this season. From the popular American Apparel magazines to right here on campus, open-backed clothes are in. Racerbacks, T-backs, plunging backs —  there are so many sides to this popular trend.
Prints 
It isn’t a shock to see the popularity of prints this season. Watercolors, tribal, floral, or safari — all are raging this spring. From jewelry to shorts to dresses, we’ve seen prints all over the high-fashion runways.
Nautical 
Jeans and lots of stripes are always a summer favorite. Invest in a versatile pair of white pants. You’re guaranteed to wear them all the time.
Back to school 
Show your school spirit. Usually we prep for back-to-school in August, but this season’s runways have been filled with knee socks, preppy stripes, workout fabrics, and academic blazers. Keep in mind to tone down the masculinity of this trend with a dash of bright color or neat lace.
Caged heels 
Last year, the gladiator sandals were undeniably the hottest shoe, but this year, an upgrade is in order. With massive straps and stiletto heels, caged heels have become this season’s must-have.
Ankle flat sandals 
Casual and sexy, ankle flat sandals are a lighter and better version of last year’s gladiator sandals. These are rare finds — a trendy shoe that you can also wear to class.
Colors for this season 
This season, either go for the unusual purples and yellows or try the neutral tones. If you feel the slightest bit cold, don’t forget to pair your colored ensemble with a universal leather jacket.

The School of Drama’s production of William Shakespeare’s Richard III was not what you’d have expected. In fact, its use of technology and its modernized take on the play marked it as a unique and interesting performance, both full of energy and relevant to modern audiences.
The production, which opened on April 15 at the Chosky Theater, attempted to put a modern twist on a Shakespeare classic. Richard (played by drama fifth-year senior Gabriel King) was the villain of the play, who killed most of the people around him to win the throne. At the beginning, Richard used a video camera to shoot videos of himself, which were displayed on a television monitor nearby.
We first saw Richard at the opening of the play, filming his speech and divulging his plan to become the villain of the tale, as he was ugly and deformed, and could not be the lover. The soldiers around him were reminiscent of a SWAT team or riot police, complete with riot masks and long, black sticks in place of guns or swords.
By the opening of the play, Richard had already killed two people, and was plotting the imprisonment and execution of his brother George (drama senior Alborz Ghandehari), while pretending it was their brother King Edward IV (drama senior Skyler Scott) who wanted George dead.
Besides the throne, Richard also desired Lady Anne (drama senior Bekie Berkman-Rivera), whose husband and father he had killed. He tried to seduce her as she grieved over the red coffin of her husband, which was eventually carried out of the theater by the soldiers.
As the play went on, more television monitors were brought to the stage. After Edward died of natural causes and not by Richard’s hand, the funeral march was shown on the screens.
Richard decided to take the lives of Edward’s two young sons (Peter Foster and Larry McKay) in order to avoid losing the throne, which he gained by having Lord Buckingham (drama senior Chase Newell) suggest that the boys were illegitimate following Edward’s death.
Perhaps one of the most powerful scenes of the performance occurred near the end. The stage was mostly dark, except for an eerie projection of light. Soldiers slept on the ground the night before the battle in which Richard would die. The ghosts of the people Richard killed returned, speaking to him, all in white except for where the red spots from the blood of their violent deaths stained their clothing. The two young boys Richard killed provided the backdrop for the scene, with one playing piano and the other singing until they, too, haunted their murderous uncle.
The play was well done, performed with a modern feel that brought the events of the power struggle between the houses of York and Lancaster in the 15th century into the 21st century using multimedia and technology.
In the program for the show, it was explained that the play as performed by the School of Drama was meant to reflect the fact that these struggles still happen today. It stated: “Violent transitions of power between opposing political forces, the cultural and religious implications of world military conflicts, the challenges faced by physically and psychologically damaged veterans, and the cynicism that accompanies the promise of a new leader are all too familiar to the American public.”
The last paragraph of the program section titled “Shakespeare, Our Contemporary” stated, “Our heightened, modern reflection of Richard III explores how a contemporary Shakespeare production can question, subvert, and reframe both the past and the present at once.”
If this was the goal of the production, it can certainly be considered a success. The ties between the past and the present were very clear, especially given the riot gear that the army soldiers wore. In light of recent events, this outerwear symbolized tyranny and an unjust use of power, something that resonated for the characters in the play as well.
The set was minimal. It consisted largely of a throne that could be lowered from the ceiling as needed and several coffins, which rarely gave the characters much of a backdrop, but not to the detriment to the play. It allowed the audience to focus on what this performance was about — the events and characters. The lack of a traditional set also allowed the events to seamlessly transition from those in the play to those in the world. With a set denoting an era, the events and meaning would be firmly grounded in time, rather than spanning the centuries as they did in this version — a good choice for this performance.
Costumes were also fitting, though confusing at times. Some characters seemed to come out of past times, while others dressed for today. The military costumes were appropriate and created a powerful image. The white-clad ghosts were also powerful, standing out from the darkly dressed soldiers around them.
The actors put on strong performances of their characters. King was especially good as Richard, using the lines to show both Richard’s ruthlessness and villainy and to show his insanity. Margaret, the former queen of England (drama senior Daisy Hobbs), was also an interesting and well-played character. With her former power gone, Margaret was unable to walk or stand and was exiled from the kingdom. She returned to speak with some of the characters, though, and Hobbs did an excellent job of showing the woman’s despair.
Each aspect of the show, from the acting to the set and the costumes to the use of media and technology, contributed to its success.
Richard III will run through Saturday at the Philip Chosky Theater in the Purnell Center. There will be a talkback session with the show’s dramaturg, Corinna Archer, Tuesday following the show. For more information or to purchase tickets, call the box office at 412.268.3293. For more background on this production and the play in general, visit richardiiicasebook.blogspot.com.

When the Trans-Siberian Orchestra (TSO) played at the Benedum Center the night of April 4, it wasn’t an average concert. The typical light and sound shows were present, certainly, but the atmosphere was very different from that of a small club or a large amphitheatre.
The TSO comes to Pittsburgh every year as part of its winter tour, in which the musicians play selections from their Christmas-themed albums. 
However, the most recent performance was part of their Beethoven’s Last Night tour, which focuses on the namesake album as well as the recently released Night Castle. Though many audience members had already seen the TSO in concert, this was a new experience for everyone.
The TSO was originally conceived as a progressive rock band by its creator, Paul O’Neill. Its shows are rock operas and the group’s rendition of Beethoven’s Last Night was no exception. 
As the lights dimmed to begin the show, the band started into a rendition of the famous composer’s final night. As the clock strikes midnight, the devil Mephistopheles appears to him and offers him a bargain. At this point the dramatic reading stops, the lights come on, and the music begins.
These two atmospheres were interspersed throughout the show. Over the course of the evening, the audience was transported back to 1827 and experienced the trials of Beethoven’s last night with him. 
The monologues advanced the plot while the music evoked the emotions of Beethoven, his beloved Princess Theresa, and the insidious Mephistopheles, among other characters. By the end of the show, the audience was as eager to follow the story as they were to hear the performance.
Despite the nontraditional format, there was no mistaking the TSO’s performance for anything but a rock concert. The Benedum Center shook with bass chords and cymbal crashes, while the light show alone made the audience applaud throughout the night.
After the TSO finished the Beethoven’s Last Night lineup, they treated the audience to selections from Night Castle. 
This album, released last October, features adaptations of famous classical works like “Carmina Burana” and “In the Hall of the Mountain King” (“The Mountain” on the TSO album), but it consists mostly of original compositions that draw from classical and modern musical traditions.
The Trans-Siberian Orchestra is a unique group, and Beethoven’s Last Night was a unique performance. Like the band’s music, the show took seemingly different sources and combined them into something completely new.

With Earth Day happening this Thursday, enjoy some tasty springtime treats while keeping our environment healthy. Try using local produce to reduce the emissions caused by transporting goods and to support local farmers. If an ingredient is available fresh, buy it! It will reduce the amount of harm done to the Earth by cutting down the production process and preservatives used.
Artichoke Risotto (Serves six) 
Ingredients: 4 cups organic vegetable stock; 2 tablespoons vegetable oil; ¼ cup minced shallots; ½ cup finely diced yellow onion; 2 minced garlic cloves; 1 cup Arborio rice; ½ artichoke heart, quartered; 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh sage; ½ cup white wine; ½ teaspoon salt; pinch of ground black pepper; ¼ cup shredded parmigiano-reggiano cheese
Directions: On low heat, warm the vegetable stock and set it aside. Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat and add the garlic, shallots, and onion. Cook until the shallots and onions are translucent. It should take about three minutes. Then add the rice and stir well before cooking for a minute.
Add the sage, white wine, artichoke heart, salt, and pepper, and cook until the wine is absorbed by the rice. Add the stock one cup at a time while stirring. Stir until the rice absorbs all of the liquid, which should take 15 minutes per cup of stock. As the stock is added, the rice should begin to look creamier. Remove the rice from the heat when all of the stock has been absorbed. Add in cheese and serve.
Blueberry Lemon Loaf (Serves eight) 
Ingredients: 1½ cups all purpose flour; 2½ teaspoons baking powder; ¼ teaspoon salt; 1 cup granulated sugar; 1/3 cup softened butter; 2 eggs; 1 lemon (squeeze the juice and grate the peel); ½ cup milk; 1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries; ¼ cup granulated sugar
Directions: Preheat the oven to 350°F and grease a 9x5–inch loaf pan. Blend flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar together with an electric mixer. Add the eggs one at a time and continue beating while adding the lemon peel. Alternately add in the flour and milk (divide into about three portions) and beat until the batter is smooth. Mix in the blueberries and pour into the loaf pan. Bake for 60–70 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the top is golden. In the meantime, prepare the syrup that will go on top by combining the lemon juice and granulated sugar in a microwave–safe bowl. Microwave for 30–45 seconds until the mixture begins to boil, and stir. Poke holes in the top of the loaf and pour the syrup over the top to ensure that the loaf absorbs it. Let it sit for 30 minutes before serving.

For those loyal MGMT fans out there, you are in for a mellow ride. Congratulations, MGMT’s sophomore album, is filled with songs I would be likely to hear if I were strolling through a haunted graveyard (if there were music) or living in the Beatles’ “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds” music video. This mixed bag of ambient and possibly drug-influenced songs is still fun to listen to and will bring a sense of nostalgia to listeners who also happen to be fans of Pink Floyd or other psychedelic rock groups.
On a positive note, the newest nine-track album from this budding group sounds well-coordinated and fluid; each song complements the next. The smooth and low-key vocals combined with muted drums and indie rhythms makes each song perfect for lounging around in one’s pajamas on a Sunday. 
On a more scandalous note, one can also imagine thse songs as a soundtrack to an acid trip. The complex guitar notes are pleasant to listen to, while the added-in electro-pop sounds make each song seem like it is constantly evolving. In fact, one 12-minute song in particular, “Siberian Breaks,” does just that. Each segment of the song contains a story with confusing lyrics and a distinct beat to match. If one listens to the album in one sitting, as I did, one will not be able to tell where one song ends and the next begins.
One thing about Congratulations that may confuse listeners is the lyrics. “Someone’s Missing” describes a person who has gone astray in a very sorrowful yet imaginative way. The album title song at first evokes the air of a slow, sappy love song, until one listens closer and realizes the song is complaining about government officials and then deciding to be apathetic. The song isn’t happy at all, but rather mocking, deftly explained by “I save my grace with half-assed guilt/And lay down the quilt upon the lawn/Spread my arms and soak up congratulations.” 
Even with the cynical and questioning undertones towards everyday life, the songwriting combined with complex sounds puts Congratulations ahead of the mainstream pack, both in terms of talent and plain old intrigue.
A great song on the album is “Flash Delirium,” one of the more upbeat songs of the bunch. While the reason for the band’s popularity may be indescribable, the beat and melody are head-rocking and the chaotic lyrics make the song that much more interesting.
Overall, these types of songs are generally not everyone’s cup of tea, but the refreshing new sounds and lyrics keep the true listeners on their toes. For bigger fans of MGMT, these songs will still be a hit or miss, and definitely a big change from their previous upbeat and faster-paced albums. While their previous tracks, released on the group’s first album Oracular Spectacular, are quite different from their newest beats, it is clear that MGMT has matured both technically and culturally with the creation of this newest album.

On July 6, 1967, Nigeria was officially torn apart by civil war. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s book Half of a Yellow Sun retells the horrific pain, fear, and violence of the Nigerian-Biafran War through the eyes of three unique protagonists: a servant boy Ugwu, his master’s rich and beautiful girlfriend Olanna, and an Englishman named Richard. Each character offers his or her own perspective on the troubled times, depicting the anguish experienced by Nigerians during the war.
Carved arbitrarily out of western Africa by the British colonial empire, Nigeria was made up of diverse African tribes that began to fight for control of the country after the British left. Democracy crumbled when two of the main tribes, the Hausa and the Igbo, opened war on each other. In an attempt to declare their independence, the Igbo created Biafra, a new country in the south.
Being Igbo, Olanna, her lover Odenigbo, their baby, and Ugwu are forced to flee their home and migrate to Biafra. Their journey to find safety in a volatile country with no real shelter, few friends, no food, and no knowledge of when the suffering is going to end is horrifyingly moving.
Adichie divides the narrative between the three main characters and plays with the timeline of the plot. Her move of tampering with the order in which readers hear the story is one that she had employed successfully in her first book, Purple Hibiscus, as well. Bypassing the interim years allows Adichie to surprise the readers with questions — Olanna now has a baby; when was the baby born? Richard and Odenigbo have had a falling out; why did that happen? — questions that are only answered when she returns to tell the tales of the missing years. 
Through the character of Ugwu, Adichie is able to communicate how harsh environments shape people for the worse, making them capable of performing acts they never thought they could. Readers witness Ugwu as an innocent boy growing up in Odenigbo’s house. Then, after the war, Olanna desperately tries to keep Ugwu from being forced to enlist in the army, but his recruitment is inevitable. Army life makes Ugwu a changed man. A major turning point in Ugwu’s life, and one that starkly depicts the lack of moral values during times of war, is when Ugwu joins his army buddies in gang-raping a woman. The description of the event stains the innocent image of Ugwu’s past — leaving a broken, unfamiliar one in its place.
Even with the broader acts of war taking place throughout the book, Adichie is able to focus on the strong personal relationships between the characters: the love-hate relationship between Olanna and her twin sister Kainene, Richard and Kainene’s unexpected love for one another, and the fracturing and healing of Olanna and Odenigbo’s bond. Adichie has a wonderfully simple and clear style of writing that lets the strength of her story speak for itself, allowing readers to be truly impacted by not just the bare facts of history, but also the torn and lost lives of her characters entangled in it.

As the minutes dragged on, the anticipation built for the much–talked–about collaborative film CMU, I Love You, a film made by Carnegie Mellon students and put together by the CMU Filmmaking Club. The idea was similar to that of the recent films New York, I Love You and Paris, je t’aime, which are collections of short clips about love that take place in each respective city. CMU, I Love You featured 13 short clips about such interpretations of love in and around campus. The stories ranged from abstract ideas to clichéd love stories.
The film started off with “Chemist” by master’s student James Wong, which shows moments of different people’s lives as they experience love or the lack thereof. The short film is done with voiceover, sometimes presented in dialogue and other times as thoughts inside people’s heads. One memorable, touching scene was of a girl waiting to meet a guy at a bus stop, but the guy never showed and she eventually left.
One of the more notable skits was “Books” by sophomore art major Benjamin Welmond, which took place in an imagined Hunt Library where books move off shelves without the help of students. Cleverly animated, the main characters are two male illustrations that literally come off the pages of a book and happen to spot a photograph of a highly attractive woman in a book. However, as a student opens the door, the books hurriedly rush back to their proper places. The student takes the book containing the woman and leaves.
“Yes, No, Maybe” by junior drama major Kendra Chapman is a bittersweet story about taking chances. A girl walks into a study lounge where a guy is already studying. He is obviously interested in her, while she hardly notices him. When she walks away, he writes a note asking her out with the options “yes”, “no”, and “maybe” on it, and slips it into her book. She soon comes back with another guy who she is obviously interested in. The original guy looks crushed and leaves after she discovers the note.
Another scene, titled “Love Rendered,” by senior business and social and decision sciences double major Megan Larcom (and the Love Rendering Crew) questions various people around campus about their passion for their field. People interviewed include Carnegie Mellon President Jared Cohon. Some of the questions are serious and 
directed towards their love of their studies, while others are funny and silly, like their opinions on the possible future creation of a love simulator.
“Tale of Two Majors” by sophomore general H&SS major Connor Fallon and junior humanities and art major William Pettijohn Hernandez was a crowd favorite and is based on the funny stereotypes of drama and computer science majors. It features a Romeo and Juliet-type love story between a female drama student and a male 
computer science student. Their friends are concerned about their respective choice in partner and how their love affects their school work. To deal with the criticisms, the couple decides to change majors.
Every scene of this film was worth watching, and it was remarkable to see the efforts of our fellow students displayed on the big screen. Let’s hope that this exciting Carnival event will become an annual Midway tradition.

As a student at Carnegie Mellon, my day-to-day life is generally measured by due dates, deadlines, and “to-do” lists. Where some might rip a page off a calendar, I remove a post-it note from a constantly expanding swamp of reminders, push pins, and reading lists that have found their way onto my bulletin board.
However, it wasn’t long ago that I lived very differently. Rather than deadlines, my days were often tracked with tally marks and numerals scrawled along the inside of a foreign map. Rather than a dorm room, my home often amounted to a jumbled collection of vinyl bus seats and patches of floor carefully contained within the circumference of my mosquito net.
These were my experiences during the eight months I lived in Southeast Asia — eight months of mosquito repellent, cinched backpacks, and unpaved road. My clothes were sun-bleached and stretched, my shoes caked with the dirt of five countries and literally falling apart at the seams. And, when I reached the end of the eight months, heading home seemed a bit of a foreign concept. But leaving Southeast Asia didn’t only amount to struggling with packing and good-byes; it also meant struggling with a collection of stories that seemed much too big to fit in my suitcase.
For the majority of the eight months I spent on the border between Thailand and Burma, I lived in a rural community of refugees who had been displaced by Burma’s government-sanctioned attacks on ethnic minority groups. These were individuals who had fled their homes and villages, leaving everything they owned and all they knew to escape to Thailand. Unfortunately, safety comes with its own set of problems for Burmese refugees: Namely, they have no rights to health care, education, or employment within Thailand. Transitioning into Thai society also poses a challenge because in addition to language and cultural barriers, many refugees left Burma severely disabled, often mentally traumatized or physically injured.
Many of the people I met had been traumatized to the point where they could no longer function in a “normal” society. Working with local nongovernment organizations, I worked to bring the arts into the healing process, offering an outlet for emotional stress while also encouraging physical recuperation through drawing and painting. I also worked with a group of children who had been orphaned or separated from their families due to violence and, with them, I created art and mural projects. These were just small acts — miniscule, really, in terms of the help I was able to offer to a group of people so desperately in need but ignored by much of the world. I didn’t feel like I was doing much — maybe offering a distraction, a comfort here and there. It was defeating, to say the least. But as the weeks went by, I began to realize that the results of my actions were not always as necessary as my sheer presence was. 
So I kept doing what I could, and as I did, my community quickly became much more than a statistic or a target group; instead they ended up becoming my family in the truest sense of the word. I ate alongside them, slept across the wooden slatted floors of their huts. In the evening when, with no electricity, it was too dark to see, we would sit around makeshift candles and talk late into the night. This was the time when I heard their stories — in the evening after darkness had been pulled across the village like a shroud. Sometimes these were stories of terror: stories of running from the junta, of hiding within hollowed-out walls. But there were also stories of restoration and healing: stories of reconnecting with lost family, of finding new hope in a new country.
These are the experiences; these are the stories that I carefully packed into my suitcases and bags as I returned home to the U.S. and entered Carnegie Mellon. It’s those stories that have seemed, by far, the heaviest of everything I’ve carried along with me from place to place. Often I misplace them, only to rediscover one hiding alongside my paintbrushes or scribbled in the margins of a page. Most of the time I’m not sure what to do with these stories when I rediscover them, but I see them revealing themselves within much of my work here. They’ve been carefully rendered within my paintings. They’ve taken many, many forms — the academic and the artistic, the written and the visual, the premeditated and the unexpected.
It’s all of these things, both in Southeast Asia and here at Carnegie Mellon — the deadlines and character counts, the peeling pages of classic fiction, the scent of turpentine late into the night, the foreign buses, mysterious food, long hikes, and customs desks — it’s all of these things that have created within me an unwavering passion for the telling of stories. It’s the stories that drive me, and my hope is that one day, these stories will not remain untold.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
**I got really drunk over Carnival and sent out a bunch of texts I shouldn’t have. I texted my exes, my friends, even my mom! What should I do? **
Sincerely,
—Silly Lady Ordering Plenty of Premiums and Yuenglings
Dear SLOPPY,
I’m glad to hear someone had a good time. Just be glad that the worst thing you did was send out a few drunk texts — things could have been a lot worse. First: texting your friends – not a big deal. Just blackmail them from the last time they got drunk. You know those photos you “deleted”? Now for your mom. Congratulations, she officially knows you drink. She’ll chew you out over the phone tomorrow. Just put her on speaker in the other room and do some homework.
Now for the exes. Were you sexting? (You can send me the details in private for more thorough advice.) I’m going to assume you don’t actually want to see your ex. So here’s what you should do: deny, deny, deny. Pull an Alberto Gonzalez — “I do not recall.” If he’s trying to restart something, ignore him. But if he’s persistent, just let him know: You were drunk and it was a mistake. You got rid of him once; you can do it again. Now the real problems come if you mixed up your texts. I can’t help you with that.
Hope you didn’t sext your mom,
—Brian Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
My girlfriend keeps trying to get me to watch Twilight and New Moon with her. She always compares me to some dude named Edward. Who is this guy? And why is my girlfriend obsessed with vampires?
**Sincerely, **
—Running Out of Blood
Dear ROB,
Congrats, you’re dating a crazy person. Like most girls nowadays, she’s in love with vampires – specifically, Edward Cullen, the handsome star of the Twilight saga. 
For some reason, girls everywhere are falling for pale, feminine-looking guys who “respect” them, “love” them, and “don’t pressure them for a physical relationship.” 
Basically, it comes down to this — chicks dig six packs and glitter. (Yeah, vampires glitter now — Dracula is spinning in his grave.)
My advice: Hit up Skibo and the arts store. Do some sit-ups and use some craft supplies. Avoid direct sunlight. Make your hair look like you just stepped out of a wind tunnel. 
Be “brooding.” Pay attention to her when she talks. Break into her house. You know, normal non-stalker-type stuff. Hey, it worked in the book.
I’m more of a Jacob man myself,
—Patrick Hoskins

Aliens of the Deep
Thursday, April 22
8 10 12
We kick off James Cameron week here at Carnegie Mellon with Aliens of the Deep, a 2005 documentary that saw Cameron team up with NASA scientists to help produce his only film between Titanic and Avatar. Cameron and the scientists use state-of-the-art technology to explore the Mid-Ocean Ridge, an underwater chain of mountains that are home to some of this planet’s most curious species of life, including creatures that do not require sunlight to survive. Freaky, huh? The documentary showcases Cameron’s passion for underwater exploration and his interest in exotic life, both major themes in many of his movies.
Avatar
Friday, April 23

The theater is sure to be packed this day as the highest-grossing movie ever (without inflation), Avatar, premieres at McConomy. Even though ticket sales suggest that everyone and their mother has seen the film twice, I’ll give a brief overview. A bunch of semi-known actors and Sigourney Weaver are living and working on the world Pandora trying to mine unobtanium while not trying to annoy the Na’vi, the native species. The winner of three Academy Awards, the movie is a visual masterpiece with stunning views and landscapes. And for those of you who whine about how the story is a carbon copy of Pocahontas, well, shut up, because this movie rocks.
The Terminator
Saturday, April 24
10 12
Is there any better way to follow up the sci-fi spectacle that is Avatar than with one of the greatest sci-fi stories ever written? Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as the titular character in this 1984 classic about a cyborg sent back in time to kill the mother of the man who leads a resistance against sentient machines. We follow Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) and Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) as they are relentlessly stalked by the Terminator, who will stop at absolutely nothing to assassinate Sarah. Fun fact: It’s hard to believe that the original film in one of the greatest movie franchises of all time was made for a scant $6.5 million.
The Abyss
Sunday, April 25
7:15 10 12:45
The Abyss sees James Cameron bringing back Michael Bieh, and adding Ed Harris and a few other unknown actors, to create this excellent adventure flick about what lies deep beneath the ocean. The story follows a civilian oil drilling team as they get involved in a search-and-rescue mission following the sinking of a U.S. submarine that encountered an unidentified life form. Fun fact: It took 7 million gallons of water to construct the massive set where most of the movie was filmed. In fact, the cast spent so much time underwater that they sometimes had to go through decompression to get used to the varying depths.

Comparisons to The White Stripes may be fair, but The Black Keys are their own act. To be entirely honest, hearing “Strange Times” by The Black Keys made “Conquest” by The White Stripes sound gimmicky. The burn of Dan Auerback’s guitar made Jack White sound like a sellout who gave up on garage rock.
Without a doubt, The Black Keys commanded the Carnival stage and caused a one-night Carnegie Mellon campus frenzy. Heavy on the attack and somber on the release, Auerback played his guitar with a slow and unrelenting burn that exchanged heavy rock riffs for solemn blues melodies. All the while, Patrick Carney beat his heart out on the drums. The two-man act gave a performance that could only be described as absolutely enthralling.
Of course, the show started low on energy; Carnegie Mellon tends to bring the most lethargic crowds. But 15 minutes into their set, The Black Keys had people jumping and kicking with excitement. The energy was amorphous and ecstatic; it came out of nowhere. The Black Keys might have given Carnegie Mellon its first genuine mosh pit.
Last year, the crowd didn’t chant for The New Pornographers to give an encore, but this year the crowd didn’t give The Black Keys an option. With the words “One more song!” echoing through Wiegand Gym, leaving the stage must have seemed impossible for Auerback and Carney. Personally, I wished the night could have lasted three days longer.

It was reported that a student named Rigamont “had a dream depicting one of the faculty in theatrical roles.” The day The Tartan allows me to start filling this space with my dreams is the final day this paper will ever be allowed in print.

The front page boasts the exciting news that this year, The Thistle will be the largest in history, with over 300 pages of content. Only half of those pages will be filled with pictures of nerdy-looking boys and girls sitting awkwardly next to each other in clusters.

A first-year wrote a hilarious column this week about how the small sleep interludes between hitting the snooze button on his alarm “are the most pleasant and satisfying anyone can ever have.” Amen to that, brother. Amen to that.

Alpha Epsilon Pi’s booth collapsed this year during the Friday night of Carnival, injuring six patrons of the booth, including a “laceration of the buttocks” for one unlucky girl. Well, let’s just hope this never happens again. We don’t want any more buttock lacerations, do we?

Apparently, Alpha Epsilon Pi’s booth has a history of collapsing every five years, a spectacle that once again occurred this week. Here’s hoping the brothers will spend a little extra on safety equipment next time in case the five-year curse strikes again.

Debates about showing pornographic films on campus were in full swing this week after a Maryland senator introduced legislature cutting state funding for schools that showed adult movies. At least in our case, shouldn’t these movies be mandatory on campus, what with the “Sex Kills...” T-shirts?

Can you list the names of all of Snow White’s seven dwarfs faster than your roommate? Can you name all 44 of the United States presidents? How many of the 195 countries of the world can you name? After sitting through all of those chemistry lectures, how familiar are you with the periodic table of elements?
If you are the type of person who likes the challenge of quizzes like these, you are not alone. People from across the nation and around the world have discovered one of the newest and most addicting game sites on the web: Sporcle. Sporcle was created by Carnegie Mellon alumnus, Matt Ramme. Ramme graduated from the School of Computer Science in 1997. On the website, www.sporcle.com, Sporcle characterizes itself as a source for “mentally stimulating diversions.” The site currently contains over 3000 fast-paced games that challenge users to beat the clock and input answers to various quiz questions. The quizzes cover a wide array of captivating topics, including geography, history, movies, music, and trivia from popular culture.
Considering its popularity now, few would believe that Sporcle was not originally intended to go public. Instead, Ramme recalls “basically trying to create a tool for myself.” Fellow Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science alumnus, best man in Ramme’s wedding, and current CEO of Sporcle, Ali Aydar, describes Matt and his wife as “avid crossword puzzle people.” Ramme wanted to expand his knowledge of trivia, and he noticed that there were several recurring crossword puzzle answers. So he began quizzing himself. When flash cards just weren’t cutting it, Ramme built a web program for himself, and the first Sporcle game was born, challenging players to master the U.S. state capitals. Sporcle made its public debut as Ramme began to post the games online. “Every time I put one up, it got played,” said Ramme.
In July 2007, Sporcle.com was featured with over 1500 “diggs” on the site digg.com. Aydar recalls, “After that, I was not surprised that [Sporcle] would go far!”
Since its original debut, Sporcle has been played over 235 million times. It has been highlighted in publications such as The Boston Globe and The Times of London. Sporcle has also made the headlines of countless other college and university newspapers. When asked what makes Sporcle so popular, Ramme claims: “It’s easy to use, easy to just jump in. [Sporcle] challenges you to want to do better next time.” He also sees his creation as a form of “accidental learning [and] entertainment.”
College students agree. First-year biological sciences major, Katie Siewert, discovered the game last semester when she saw her roommate playing it. “Sporcle is unlike other ways to procrastinate. It’s like a puzzle that exercises your brain,” she said. Sophomore computer science major Grace Nam agreed. “I feel a lot better about procrastinating on Sporcle than on Facebook. I don’t feel like I’m wasting as much time,” she said.
Senior chemical engineering major Andrew Passarotti is also a big fan of Sporcle. “Sporcle is a test to see how much useless trivia you know, although some of it turns out to be useful, like listing all of the presidents,” he said. Passarotti’s favorite Sporcle is the Pokémon quiz. “I’ve taken it multiple times to see if I can get better.”
Ramme takes his place among the Carnegie Mellon University graduates who have found success through innovation. Over the past three years, Ramme has become convinced that “if you can solve a problem you have for yourself, others will share the same problems and will benefit from your solutions.” Ramme advised Carnegie Mellon students to “do something you like.… instead of searching for ‘the great answer,’ search for answers for yourself.”
Both Ramme and Aydar are excited that Sporcle has found a niche on the Carnegie Mellon campus. They have revealed that there are several new site features to look forward to in the future.

Last Thursday, entrepreneur and budding writer Stephen Greer spoke to Carnegie Mellon’s Entrepreneurship Club, sharing his business experience and his new book, Starting From Scrap: An Entrepreneurial Success Story.
In Starting From Scrap, Greer recounts his story of almost 20 years in the scrap metal recycling business in Asia. A Pennsylvania native, he graduated from Penn State in the early 1990s, but found that jobs and internships were scarce due to the recession. So in 1993, after hearing from a friend that the Asian market was booming, Greer set out on a mission to succeed abroad.
“I couldn’t find the jobs I wanted in the United States,” said Greer in Thursday’s lecture. “A friend told me that he had a friend in Hong Kong and that there were so many business opportunities in Asia’s booming economy. I knew my dad had a lot of free airline miles he’d been saving up, so I asked him for a free ticket to Hong Kong.”
Greer got the ticket, headed to Hong Kong, and was soon immersed in a business market that was strikingly different from what he had experienced in the United States.
“Hong Kong is a very entrepreneurial town — everyone in one way or another is their own boss,” Greer said. “I became completely caught up in that and fell in love with the city.”
However, Greer’s entrance into the Asian market wasn’t without its flaws. He started his own business, registering it as “Hartwell Pacific,” because, as he said, “Hartwell was my middle name, and I decided to use it because I didn’t want everyone to know that I was the only one involved in my business.” From there, he began to search for his place within Hong Kong’s booming economy.
“I looked at anything and everything: Christmas ornaments, wood, hairnets, work gloves. There was a world full of opportunity; I just had to choose something and go for it,” Greer said.
Greer eventually landed a deal with scrap-metal suppliers in Asia, initiating his entrance into the scrap metal and recycled metal business. There he found success, first in the sales of scrap metal and, eventually, in adapting his company to also recycle used metal, melting it down and reforming it into new stainless steel.
With this adjustment, Greer’s business soared, opening eight operations in seven countries in one and a half years. As he put it, “By 28 I was a multi-millionaire, which was of course a good thing.” 
In 2008, after achieving a turnover of $250 million, as well as selling Hartwell Pacific to Australia’s Smorgon Steel Group and Smorgon Steel, he resigned from his position with Hartwell Pacific and became a senior adviser to Oaktree Capital, a global investment management corporation.
However, financial gain, Greer stresses, is not his ultimate concern. “Success is living the life you want to live on your terms — and I’m not talking about money. The reality is that there is a limit to how much money can improve your happiness. But, if you find something that you like and that you’re passionate about — that will take you a long way,” Greer said.
Entrepreneurship Club member and Tepper graduate student Justin G. Shaka introduced Greer as having an “important outlook on entrepreneurship across the globe.”
This holds true for many of the students in Entrepreneurship Club, as Greer’s lessons are especially applicable in today’s global market. The current economic recession bears some similarities to the recession in the early 1990s, when Greer first arrived in Hong Kong. 
According to Greer, periods of recession can drive further exploration and valuable risks. “It’s a hard time to find a job in today’s poor economy,” Greer said. “But it’s also a great time to start your own business. Bad economies can be great times to be entrepreneurs.”
Greer also expressed the valuable business lessons he learned due to his experiences across the globe. “It’s a big world — a global economy — and people need to be thinking about how they, and how their country, fit into that.”
These thoughts are echoed by Marc Faber, world-renowned economist and author of the Gloom, Doom and Boom Report. In his review of Greer’s book, he wrote that Greer “proves with a fascinating account of his business life that there are even more opportunities in Asia as countries such as China, India, and Vietnam open up and liberalize.”
Greer’s book is available now and has been listed on the South China Morning Post Bestsellers List.

Late Carnegie Mellon computer science professor Randy Pausch’s influence may have increased exponentially after the Last Lecture, but, according to colleagues, he had been an inspiring individual to work with throughout his time at Carnegie Mellon.
In his new book The Comet and the Tornado, executive producer of the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) Don Marinelli, writes about his personal transition from drama to computer science, as well as his time working at the ETC with Pausch.
Together, Marinelli and Pausch founded the ETC, the collaboration of left- and right-brained thinking. Marinelli, with a background in drama, was the creative right-brained thinker, while Pausch, with a computer science degree, was much more left-brained.
The title of the book originates in the nicknames of the two colleagues. Pausch called Marinelli the “Tornado,” referring to his vibrant energy and creativity. While thinking of a word to describe Pausch, Marinelli came up with the “Comet.” “Comet Randy burst upon the scene like an astral body ... illuminating his secrets for living life to the fullest for millions of folks who needed such guidance ... Comet Randy left millions of people stunned, amazed, happy, giddy, and seeing light where there had been only darkness,” Marinelli said in a Carnegie Mellon press release.
Marinelli’s motive behind putting the book together was two-fold. Pausch’s name has been mainly associated with the creation of the Alice software but he has also played a major role at the ETC. “Few know that the ETC really is the legacy of Randy Pausch, so I wanted to set the record straight,” Marinelli said. Secondly, Marinelli opines that Pausch is now viewed as a saint and through this book Marinelli wants to bring some of the humanity back to Pausch’s image. “I don’t want Randy to lose the ‘human’… humanity is a great strength,” he said.
Crystal Lee, a graduate student in lighting and design, heard Marinelli speak about his book at the United States Institute for Theatre Technology in Kansas City, Missouri, and wanted to read more about it. “Since the School of Drama is closely affiliated with the ETC, I wanted to see how the ETC was formed prior to my coming to CMU,” she said.
Marinelli hopes to write a second book in the future, but is currently focused on continuing to make the ETC a global initiative, recruiting people from around the world to contribute their left- and right-brained talents.

Cassell, graduate students recognized
Cassell named HCII director
Randal Bryant, the dean of the School of Computer Science, has announced the appointment of Justine Cassell as the new director of the school’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII). Cassell will hold the position beginning Aug. 1, 2010.
Cassell is currently the director of the Center for Technology and Social Behavior at Northwestern University. Cassell is a professor in the School of Communication and the McCormack School of Engineering and Applied Science, as well as graduate director of the technology and social behavior Ph.D. program at Northwestern.
Cassell’s research currently focuses on computer systems that interact with people in ways that humans might. 
She is credited with creating the first virtual human that is capable of communicating using both verbal language and nonverbal actions, called the Embodied Conversational Agent. 
More recently, Cassell has used the agent to research the role that technology can play as a virtual peer for children, particularly those learning a language. 
In conjunction with this language study, Cassell has also researched online conversation and interaction among young people, specifically how such conversation enhances or impairs self-esteem, self-efficacy, and sense of community.
Graduate research honored
Carnegie Mellon’s Graduate Student Appreciation Week was held from April 5 through  April 9, during which Carnegie Mellon graduate students were recognized for their contributions.Specific honors included this year’s Graduate Student Teaching and Graduate Student Service Award winners, Benjamin Jantzen and Chad Ellis, respectively. 
Jantzen, a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the philosophy department, was recognized for his academic talent and dedication to teaching. Ellis, a Ph.D. candidate in the chemistry department who served as the 2009 vice president of external affairs for Carnegie Mellon’s Graduate Student Assembly, was this year’s recipient of the Graduate Student Service Award. On the national level, Ellis helped to limit the visa problems that many international graduate students face, even taking his case to Congress.
Several students will also be honored for their research as winners of a competition titled “ ‘Where in the World?’ Global Impacts of Research.” Rebecca Mayer of the engineering and public policy (EPP) department; Jon Kowalski of EPP; and Lini Fu, a student in the Heinz College’s Master of Public Policy and Management program, will be honored for their international research efforts.

Today marks the 91st anniversary of the first successful parachute jump and free fall. Leslie Irvin was the inventor of the parachute “rip-cord” system and in 1919 was the first man to make a premeditated free-fall jump from an airplane. In honor of Irvin’s historic jump, we’ll look at some parachuting statistics throughout history:
Number of jumps made yearly by registered parachutists: 2.5 million
Number of parachuting-related fatalities in 2009: 16 
Average height from which parachute jumps are made: 12,000 feet
Average free-fall speed: 110 mph

Carnegie Mellon launched its newest alumni initiative, the Loyal Scot program, a few weeks ago. And while The Tartan supports efforts to create a stronger community and alumni network, we are not completely sold on the new campaign.
The campaign is a reward system for alumni. Alumni who donate each year, volunteer at events, and keep their contact information up to date become Loyal Scots. 
It’s great that the university is reaching out to students and alumni alike to make sure that they feel connected to campus. The website, www.cmu.edu/loyalscot, is well designed and easy to use. It provides the requirements for becoming a Loyal Scot, a simple four-step process, and helpful information concerning how to complete each of those requirements. It is a good source of information for alumni who are looking to reconnect. It also has a blog with videos from different Loyal Scots.
Despite this strong foundation, the program itself is cheesy. The slogan is “Plaid to the bone.” The website uses cutesy sayings like “Wear your plaid on your sleeve” and “Show your Tartan pride.” It notes that “Scotty,” our school mascot, is a charter member. Using these tools to get people involved makes it feel much more like a forced advertising campaign than a program that rewards the community for remaining engaged in campus after leaving.
It’s nice to see that people who are dedicated to anything and everything Carnegie Mellon will be recognized. We know that talented people have gone through Carnegie Mellon, and we want to make sure they feel connected and welcomed back to campus. 
We certainly want more people who went to Carnegie Mellon to give back once they’ve left. This campaign appears to be a step in the right direction, but embracing these ideas would be enough without creating silly slogans and incentives.

The fact that the economy isn’t doing too well is stale news. Students have experienced the rough economy through rising tuition and a serious dearth of jobs and internships, have complained about it, and have finally learned to accept it. However, a recent study showed that it isn’t just us students and prospective job hunters who are being adversely affected by the bad economy, but the faculty of universities as well.
According to a survey conducted by the American Association of University Professors, salaries for university faculty rose by 1.2 percent this year — the smallest increase in 50 years. The survey also found that salaries decreased in one-third of reporting universities. In fact, the situation might be worse than indicated by the results, as part-time faculty members were not included in the survey. Many universities are leaning toward hiring more part-time faculty to replace tenured professors to cut costs. Furthermore, a number of universities also reduced funding for research, traveling, and sabbaticals.
While budget cuts at universities are a necessary part of dealing with the current financial climate, it does present a rather worrisome situation. The reputation of a university banks on the accomplishments of its faculty. Whether it be excellence in teaching or accomplishments in research, faculty members make a significant contribution to the university. Faculty salary cuts might discourage students from going into academia. Further, if universities continue to hire more part-time faculty to replace tenured faculty, the quality of education and research at the institution will decrease. Lack of funding for research will also reflect poorly on the quality of work generated by the university.
Although we understand that taking certain drastic measures becomes necessary in times like these, we also believe that reducing faculty salaries will have serious long-term repercussions. Universities should carefully consider all the long-term effects that such budget cuts will have before taking action.

Hey Tartans,
I hope that all of you had an exciting and wonderful Carnival!
Spring Carnival is one of the best displays of the community spirit that has grown over the last academic year, and once again the Carnegie Mellon the community came together to celebrate one of its greatest traditions in full force. A job well done to all of those who participated, whether it be working on Booth or Buggy, participating in the Scotch’n’Soda show, putting on the Spring Carnival shows, or helping organize the Spring Carnival activities and making Carnival safe for all students.
Earlier this month, students voted in student government elections and elected me and Kate as student body president and vice president. We could not be more grateful for all of the support for our campaign, and we cannot wait to get the ball rolling on all of the initiatives and ideas that we advertised in our campaign, as well as those that will arise from your thoughts and suggestions for Carnegie Mellon.
Over the summer, Kate and I will spend a great deal of time working on a number of things to ensure that we hit the ground running not only on the traditional initiative front, but also by continuing to establish relationships with the rest of student government and members of the administration when we arrive in the fall.
We will begin working on our initiative to showcase our campus organizations and student life to first-years immediately to ensure that it is well planned, successful, and collaborative with the Orientation staff. 
We will also begin looking at sources of funding for our Executive Grant Program and structuring the first month’s worth of CMU Connect Socials.
To ensure that we are staying connected to you and that you can continue to learn about our work over the next few months, we encourage you to continue to visit www.acollegetobelievein.com to stay updated with our initiatives and work to improve Carnegie Mellon.
You can also follow us on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jarrettandkate or e-mail us at jarrettandkate@gmail.com. We encourage your feedback and hope that you throw us any idea, suggestion, question, or concern anytime you want.
Again, many thanks to all of you who supported us in elections — we are confident that we can deliver to you all of the initiatives that we have proposed and more.
We hope all of you enjoy the last few weeks of classes, good luck on finals, and we’ll see you around campus!

The Tartan’s April 12 board editorial (“Anonymity of Wikileaks could be future of journalism”) highlights one very dynamic use of new media to pursue investigative journalism.
In an age when investigative journalism is being slashed from mainstream print news because of its prohibitive expense, there’s a lot of anxiety over who will continue as the watchdog over the powers that be. The anonymous release of such an incredible piece of news on once-obscure Wikileaks — with its mysterious investigative methods and clandestine connections to a nebulous ring of high-powered research institutions — induced an anxious fit of navel-gazing among new and old media alike about investigative journalism’s new future on the web.
But before we use the Wikileaks incident to declare that the world of information is flat, there remains one inescapable truth: Good journalism, and especially the investigative kind, still costs money, even if it appears on a fringe website.
Followers of the story know that Wikileaks is kept afloat, like many important wikis, entirely through donations. In January, The Guardian, a leading news source in the UK and a supporter of Wikileaks, wrote, “If you want to read the exposes of the future, it’s time to chip in.”
And they’re right: Wikileaks brought you a really interesting and important bit of news for free. But it still has battalions of servers to maintain in three different nations, staff to pay, and even people that travel and check stories out in person. That’s expensive, and like news on the printed page, there’s no guarantee it’s going to stick around unless you are willing to pay for it.
Other journalists, hoping to use the community as a resource to fund this often-expensive process, have banded together on a site called 12Spot.us. Spot is a very simple concept: People who would like to write a news story, but don’t have the funding necessary to do the journalistic work, can “pitch” a story to, well, you. And everyone. Story ideas are listed online, and if you like the idea, you can give the future author a donation to start or complete his or her work. Would-be writers list how much they need (usually a few hundred bucks), what they would like to cover (“Agriculture Poisons Water for 1.3 Million in San Joaquin County”), and what their qualifications are.
In the short term, the idea of individuals and groups paying for the investigative journalism they want to see instead of turning to large newspapers is exciting, and not so unlike hiring a private investigator instead of relying on the police. In the long run, though, sticky questions may arise about whether it’s a good idea to introduce such a clear bias in journalism. It’s going to get very hairy when large, civic-minded, and (mostly) unbiased print newspapers no longer provide investigation as a public service.
Either way, the moral of the story is that a free press is actually quite expensive. If you’d like to continue benefiting from the contributions that high-quality investigative journalism makes to a free society, it’s going to cost you. And you’d better pay up.

Half a century after Brown v. Board of Education, a recent Washington Post story began: “A federal judge Tuesday ordered a rural county in southwestern Mississippi to stop segregating ... African American students into all-black classrooms.”
That such a lede, much less the actual event, can exist today is an embarrassment to our nation. It evokes a darker past that seemingly is still present, one in which fundamental human rights were denied.
The Walthall County school system has for years allowed white students to transfer from predominantly black schools to a school that has mostly white students. The end result of these transfers is the creation of many segregated classrooms and disproportionate enrollment at different county schools.
Racially motivated transfer options are not the only problem with the Walthall County schools. Segregation exists even within individual buildings. Schools often grouped white students into a few specific classes, meaning that even schools that had an overall diverse population were often segregated on a smaller scale. There was a predominance of classes that had only white or only black students.
Though this transfer process may not be as direct as the legal discrimination that existed in the Jim Crow era, its final effects are similar, and its premise is just as terrible. 
By dividing schools and classrooms by race, Walthall County and its citizens are promulgating the racist ideas that have plagued America, particularly the South, for so long. Instead of learning from diversity, students in Walthall County will only be exposed to views similar to their own.
One might argue that Walthall County is an anomaly, that the rest of the country understands the benefits of diversity. But then one looks to Raleigh, N.C., where the Wake County school board decided last month to discard a commitment to diversity in schools, according to The News and Observer in Raleigh. Though this decision was made to create community-based schools and not expressly to encourage segregation, it still indicates a decreased emphasis on diversity.
If the United States is to continue its progress toward a more equal society, the next generation must be able to appreciate diversity. This requires exposure to different people and ideas, forcing students to re-evaluate their beliefs. If school populations are monolithic, this exposure will not happen, and it will be that much more difficult to progress as a society.
In the hours and days after the 2008 Presidential elections, many pundits claimed that America had developed a “post-racial society.” They proposed, despite widespread evidence to the contrary, that the nation was colorblind. Instances like the one in Walthall County show that these claims are merely idealistic hopes. The reality is that discrimination and racism still exist, and they remain a way of life in many parts of the country. If we are to truly move past the era of racism, children must not follow in their parents’ footsteps. They must be able to recognize that diverse cultures are valuable.

From being a chance to dress up and dance in the high school gym, prom has catapulted to becoming, at least in the state of New York, an excuse for teenagers to spend the night out clubbing in Manhattan or road-tripping to the Jersey shore. In an effort to curb the underage binge drinking that ensues, Pearl River High School in Pearl River, N.Y. has decided to schedule prom on a school night.
By making this decision, the school administration is infringing on what is certainly a parental as well as an individual responsibility. Students should be educated enough to understand the dangers associated with alcohol. They should also be aware of the health risks involved with excessive drinking. It should not be the school’s responsibility to ensure that students make the right choice when leaving prom. By changing the night of prom, all students, including those who were not breaking the rules, are punished.
In light of the bad reputation of prom after-parties, parents need to be able to enforce better rules and restrictions on their children as they see fit. The school can assist, but cannot be responsible for making sure that every single student has returned home safely ­— the parents need to take care of that.
Changes such as shifting prom to a Wednesday or Sunday night, rewarding students with breakfast and recreational activities when they show up the next day, or punishing them by not allowing them to participate in academic work if they don’t are ineffective ways to deal with a larger problem. These are stop-gap measures that won’t actually prevent students from embracing alcohol and late-night adventures on their prom night. The real solution is educating high school students about the risks and responsibilities that begin after prom ends, an education that doesn’t fall solely on the school but must also be discussed at home.

This letter is in response to Amanda Cole’s April 12 editorial, “Abstinence-only education harms teenagers.” I could not agree more with the points Amanda made in her article. She writes about the importance of sex education that ensures teenagers are informed from a reliable source.
The reason the article left such an impression on me was due to one of my friend’s blog posts that I recently read. My friend Lorena is currently serving in the Peace Corps as a teacher in Burkina Faso. Her most recent entry includes her recap of “Women’s Day,” celebrated on March 8 in Burkina Faso. She writes that it is the “one given day to praise all women.” Typical festivities include men doing the cooking. Lorena took the day as an opportunity to teach a group of her students about HIV/AIDS and contraceptives.
The Peace Corps provides its teachers with all the necessary supplies for sex education, including male and female condoms and a wooden penis and vagina. While such explicit teaching is almost unheard of in American sex education, in Burkina Faso, high rates of infidelity and infection make it an even more pressing need.
American policies could certainly learn from the Peace Corps model. No one is out there teaching people how to protect themselves. As Amanda wrote, “[Teens will] get their information from less reliable sources, like the Internet, magazines, and TV.” But by keeping safe practices secret, what are we really achieving? Lorena addresses this same type of misunderstanding in Africa. She writes about how men will list reasons not to use contraceptives, including superstitions. Ideas like these stem from a lack of education.
Lorena ended her post about Women’s Day by highlighting the fact that she knows not everyone will agree with her teaching. But she points out that “a person’s health is a little more important than the fact of whether it’s right or not to use a contraceptive.”
I hope that educators and policymakers in our country can step back from the situation a little as well and question the goals of sex education. Does teaching students in a classroom really encourage them to have sex? I think the value of having an informed population is much greater than that risk.

A disease runs rampant in many university communities, and it isn’t swine flu — or alcoholism, for that matter. It’s narcissism, or what I like to call an “Inflated Sense of Self.”
It’s simple to get: You take the attitudes embedded in arrogance, the “look at me” thoughts inherent in personal accomplishments, the self-servingness in egocentrism, the notion that we are better than everyone else in snobbery, the complimentary exaggerations that lead to delusion, and a fine dash of superiority. You puree this for a couple of years in a high-pressure blender, and you get a pulpy mixture that is the Inflated Sense of Self (ISOS).
It’s not in any social psychology textbook yet, but in the future, somewhere between learning about prejudice (a.k.a. how our group is better than all other groups) and stereotypes (a.k.a. I can reduce your group to negative overgeneralizations), college students will learn about the behaviors of their own kind.
As one example, we can take me as a hypothetical ISOS victim, and together we can flesh out the course of the disease.
I would say I’m a pretty good writer. When I say “pretty good writer,” I’m just being modest. I consider myself to be pretty damn good. Editors have on many occasions come crawling to me, begging to hear the melodic sweetness that is my writing. 
Professors have e-mailed me back regarding drafts telling me I’m a “clear, concise” writer and “have a unique twist on things,” a comment that, of course, I construed as a strong compliment.
To fully indulge in the greatness that is me, I Googled “Cynthia Peng, The Tartan” and found numerous links. 
Apparently, my articles have been selected for publication on a gamut of sites no one ever browses, but the fact that they were sitting out there waiting to be perused was enough to buffer my ego.
For example, I found a link on some random person’s Xanga to an article I wrote about why Michelle Kwan should be President. Up until that point, I, along with the majority of the population, had completely forgotten about the cultural explosion that was Xanga. 
However, I relished in the thought that someone out there, far removed from me, took the two minutes to skim my haphazardly written yet supposedly brilliant article and posted it on “Skating articles of the week” for May 2008. There it was, thoroughly critiqued and deemed excellent enough to be thrust into the cyberworld. Never mind that May 2008 was long after anyone had stopped keeping up with Xanga; the blog “Kwantifiable” deemed it of quality.
Some kid’s mom tracked me down to show her undue appreciation for an exceptionally well-written article on her son’s piano performance. My article on piano phenom Lang Lang was linked to a site that had been hacked, but that was okay, because at one point in time someone cared enough to link it there in the first place.
After Googling myself for a while, I got bored. 
Some of the links on sea urchin conferences or computer science competitions were clearly not me, and the fact that other people had my exact name made my narcissistic self highly uncomfortable. Also, I didn’t want to dig deeper in the depths of the Internet just in case, heaven forbid, someone posted something negative about one of my articles.
Being narcissistic about my own writing took a lot of time and effort. 
My sense of self was no longer inflated; I was back to normal again. Thus, having cured myself of the disease that so many of our peers suffer from, I decided to focus my energy on other things, like putting all my articles in one place just in case someone decides to write a Ph.D. dissertation on my unprecedented and effortless talents.
Cynthia Peng (cynthiap@) will go on to win many prestigious awards for this article.
