Well, that’s it.
The 2022 college football season — save for the bowls and the playoffs — is over, and they have left the College Football Playoff Committee with possibly the toughest set of decisions they have ever had to make. Now that the season is over, rankings don’t matter: all that’s left is to project who will make the playoffs, and who will make the New Year’s Six bowls.
In case you haven’t been following, the last two weeks have taken us from simplicity to sheer chaos in the college football world. On the last weekend of the regular season, Michigan beat Ohio State, while #7 Louisiana State, #8 Clemson, and #10 Oregon all lost. #1 Georgia, #2 Michigan, #4 USC, #5 TCU, #6 Penn State, and #9 Alabama were the only top ten teams to win. This week, chaos multiplied, with favorites losing championship games and throwing the playoff seedings into not just doubt, but disarray.
On Friday, one-loss USC — poised for the program’s first playoff berth ever — got blown out by 9-3 Utah, losing a 47-24 humiliation in the Pac-12 championship game, sticking them with their second loss and knocking them out of the top four. Then, to start the championship slate Saturday, undefeated TCU and 9-3 Kansas State gave us a terrific back-and-forth Big 12 title game, going to overtime tied at 28. TCU appeared to be on the doorstep of scoring, but a brilliant defensive stand — with second-down, third-down, and fourth-down stops on the goal line — kept TCU off the board. On their ensuing possession, Kansas State kicked a field goal to win, 31-28, and crush TCU’s hopes of an undefeated season.
In the SEC Championship, Georgia secured their playoff berth while doing what they were supposed to and blew LSU out of the building in a bizarre game that featured a blocked LSU field goal returned for a Georgia touchdown (Louisiana State appeared to forget that the ball was in play) and a Bulldogs interception off of the helmet of LSU receiver Jack Bech. Michigan took care of business against four-loss Purdue in the Big Ten Championship, punching their ticket as well. Finally, Clemson did their duty against Wake Forest, securing the ACC title with an 11-2 record.
If you didn’t watch, this is where things stand. If you’re confused, you’re right. And if you can’t find four teams in this motley collection that look like playoff teams, well, you’re right about that too. So who’s in, and who’s out?
There are no rules to who makes the college football playoffs, but we have some patterns that come as close to rules as you can get. The strongest is that you cannot lose twice and make the playoff. In the eight years of the playoffs so far, 32 teams have qualified for the tournament. Of the 32, 12 were undefeated and 20 had lost once. Never has a team with two losses made the playoff. In 2016, this rule was more or less penciled into granite when two-loss Penn State, who won the Big Ten championship, was left out of the playoff at the expense of the one-loss Ohio State Buckeyes, who had lost to the Nittany Lions during the regular season. Ever since, teams have been clear. Lose once, you’re looking good. Lose twice, and you’re done.
The second golden rule is that at least three conference champions are in the playoff. This has always been the case, and ever since the beginning of the playoff system, three conference champs have made their way into the tournament. In fact, it’s usually four — just twice in a full season (Ohio State in 2016 and Georgia in 2021) has a team which failed to win their conference qualified for the playoffs.
So using these rules, what’s the playoff looking like? Georgia, the #1 seed, has a 13-0 record and the SEC championship. They’re in. Michigan, the #2 seed, is 13-0 and topped the Big Ten. There remain two spots to be filled, and filling them will be difficult.
The three remaining conference champions are Utah (Pac-12, 10-3), Kansas State (Big 12, 10-3), and Clemson (ACC, 11-2). This is uncharted territory, because the only time before 2022 where three Power Five conference champions were 11-2 or worse (2021), Cincinnati, the American Athletic Conference champions, were 13-0 and ready to pick up that fourth spot. Yet this year, we have no Cincinnati, and under the two-loss rule, none of the conference champions can be chosen. So who’s next?
The most obvious candidate is Ohio State, who romped through their schedule with relative ease before coming up against a wall of Wolverines in their final game, finishing 11-1. All things considered, Ohio State should take the third playoff spot. Now, we know a rule must be broken for the fourth. We must either take a second non-champion — something the committee has never done — or one of the two- or three-loss champions; this spot will most likely be filed by Clemson, the only one with just two losses.
Of the non-champions, TCU has the best case. They finished 12-1 in the Big 12, which would normally be enough. However, the Big 12 is terrible this year, and TCU has never looked dominant. Only four of their regular-season opponents had a winning record, and they won those three games by a combined seventeen points. And, of course, one of those opponents was Kansas State, who put paid to the Horned Frogs’ undefeated season this weekend. TCU doesn’t look like a team ready to compete — but then, who does?
Once we’ve taken out TCU, there are no more Power Five teams with only one loss. That’s it. The only other Power Five two-loss teams are USC (Pac-12), Clemson (ACC), Penn State (Big Ten), and Alabama and Tennessee (SEC). Penn State can be eliminated first, as Ohio State is in, and the committee won’t want to put three Big Ten teams in the playoff. (They also lack any quality wins on their resumé, despite having the best two losses in college football.) USC is next. They’ve played their share of close games, and they’ve lost to Utah twice now (once in the regular season and once in the conference championship). If USC were to be put in, Utah would be howling — and rightly so. 
This leaves Clemson, Alabama, and Tennessee. Tennessee beat Alabama, but has a loss to Georgia and, more importantly, a terrible loss to South Carolina where the Volunteers allowed 63 points to a mid-level Gamecocks squad. Clemson, too, lost to South Carolina and took a three-touchdown drubbing from Notre Dame earlier in the season.
That leaves us with Alabama, who have lost two games and didn’t look good doing it, but lost them by a combined total of four points. Ultimately, then, the question that the committee will ask themselves is: What’s more impressive — TCU, beating a lackluster slate and losing to three-loss Kansas State in the championship, whose inclusion would mean three conferences are represented? Or Alabama, beating six SEC teams and losing only to two-loss Tennessee and three-loss LSU, which would make the playoff a two-conference affair?
It’s impossible to know what the committee will decide, but my money is on the Crimson Tide. If they manage to claw back from the dead, it will be a moment to remember. However, if they do win the playoff berth, that brings up a substantial question for the committee. Georgia is #1, locked in; Michigan, at #2, is also locked in. If Ohio State and Alabama are the other two teams, there’s no reasonable way to place Alabama ahead of Ohio State, so Ohio State would have to be #3, and Alabama at #4.
For myself, I hope they do this. Thanks to the bracket structure, the #1 Georgia Bulldogs would play Alabama, and Michigan would go up against Ohio State, giving us a Big Ten vs Big Ten semifinal, an SEC vs SEC semifinal, and a guaranteed Big Ten vs SEC final. The two conferences which lay claim to being the superconferences of the future would face off in the title game, making for an epic championship game.
Based on these playoff predictions, I’ve outlined my New Year’s Six bowl predictions below:
Peach Bowl: Georgia vs. Alabama
Fiesta Bowl: Michigan vs. Ohio State
Rose Bowl: Penn State vs. Utah
Sugar Bowl: Tennessee vs. Kansas State
Orange Bowl: Clemson vs. Louisiana State
Cotton Bowl: TCU vs. Tulane
Bowls start in a few weeks, and the ones that count kick off on New Year's Eve. That'll be it from me until January, but I hope you've enjoyed following along this whirlwind of a season. In the meantime, the committee announces their final choices on Tuesday, Dec. 6. Happy watching, good luck on your finals, and enjoy your break — see you in 2023!

CMU RESEARCH ROUNDUP
Robots that can sense layers of clothing
To humans, folding something like a jacket or pants is easy. To a robot that doesn't quite understand the concept of multiple layers of cloth, picking up and folding everyday clothing can be hard. Because robots primarily use their vision to sense objects, when they see clothing, they often only see and pick up the top layer. This makes it difficult for robots to perform household tasks like folding laundry.
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon's Robotic Institute speculated that what the robots needed was to have a sense of touch in addition to their sense of vision. They partnered with Meta AI to develop ReSkin, an inexpensive tactile sensor to be attached to robot fingertips, also released as open source. ReSkin senses changes in magnetic fields from depressions or movement of the skin, so that when a robot pinches clothing, it can determine how many layers of cloth there are. In experiments, they found that this tactile sensor improved how well it grabbed multi-layered clothing.
Legged robots that climb up stairs and recover after slipping
Carnegie Mellon and UC Berkeley researchers have created a four-legged robot that adapts according to the terrain, climbing slippery stairs and rocky terrain on hills. The robot is controlled by a small onboard computer with a machine learning model trained on 4,000 clones in a simulator, giving the robot "six years of experience in a day." It also has a vision system that is directly connected to the robot's controls: Instead of first mapping the environment and planning actions, the robot acts on whatever it sees. This allows for faster, more adaptive response to changes in the environment. This functionality also makes the robot 25 times cheaper than alternatives.
In addition, the researchers added functionality that mirrored the way humans and four-legged animals move. For example, when humans walk up stairs, they use their hips to rotate their legs to the side to give them more space. Cats and four-legged animals have hind legs that mimic the movements of the front legs, avoiding the same obstacles without needing another pair of eyes. 
A noninvasive ICP monitoring practice that doesn't require drilling holes in heads
While intracranial pressure (ICP) is important to monitor in cases of traumatic brain injury, types of brain hemorrhaging, and other life-threatening brain conditions, in many instances monitoring ICP requires drilling a hole in the skull. A probe is then placed inside the skull to measure the pressure. ICP is also an indicator of brain health. 
However, this practice is expensive and risks giving the patient an infection or even damaging the brain. The practice hasn't changed much since the 1970s despite numerous attempts to find a noninvasive alternative. 
In light of this, Carnegie Mellon biomedical engineering researchers have managed to find two noninvasive approaches for ICP monitoring. These approaches utilize near-infrared spectroscopy and diffuse correlation spectroscopy in which a sensor is placed on the head and measures how much light has interacted with the brain. A machine learning algorithm examines the blood flow change data from the sensors and determines ICP.
Jana Kainerstorfer's biomedical optics lab then partnered with UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh in a clinical trial with 15 participants, and found that the results from noninvasive approaches were similar to those of invasive approaches. The findings were published in Journal of Neurosurgery.
NATIONAL NEWS
Does the decline of Twitter mean the rise of Mastodon?
Amid the chaos of Twitter, smaller but similar social media platforms have been gaining attention. The most attention-grabbing is Mastodon, which calls itself "decentralized social media."
Mastodon is part of the fediverse, which the Electronic Frontier Foundation describes as "a large network of independently operated social media websites." Basically, anyone on the network can host a Mastodon server, or an instance, for their community and connect them to other instances. Each instance operates like a hashtag of Tweets, except each instance moderator can decide who joins and can block posts from other instances. As Mastodon likes to say, "Everybody owns Mastodon."
Despite some Twitter users claiming they would join Mastodon if Twitter's situation doesn't improve, some analysts beg to differ. An article from NewsScientist reports that "Of more than 140,000 Twitter users who announced they were moving to Mastodon, just 1.6 percent have actually quit Elon Musk’s social media platform."
COP27 Recap
This year's United Nations Climate Change conference COP27 took place in Egypt from Nov. 6. to Nov. 20. Here's a quick recap:
The Loss and Damage Fund: The UN agreed that richer countries would pay for the "loss and damages" faced by poorer countries due to climate change and established a dedicated fund for it. The idea is that larger countries have contributed more to global climate change, and therefore should pay for the consequences caused in other countries. The EU and U.S. have previously been against it, but at COP27 agreed on the condition that China, classified as a developing country, also pays for loss and damages.
The small wins: As the global temperature continues to rise, weather extremes and natural disasters will increase. The UN has released the Early Warning for All plan to warn people in low-income countries of climate-related hazards such as extreme storms and floods. The plan calls for $3.1 billion over the next five years, and hopes to use machine learning and data tools to provide these warnings. The U.S. and dozens of other countries are formally pledging to cut down on methane emissions.
Trouble getting nations to explicitly agree to cut down on fossil fuels: Some nations called for cutting down on fossil fuels to be explicitly included in the final agreement. However, oil lobbyists and speakers from UN nations that profit largely from fossil fuels discouraged including such statements. Instead, "countries should cut down on how much coal they use unless they're taking steps to reduce emissions, and it says countries should stop giving subsidies to the fossil fuel industry that make it harder to cut emissions," as NPR reports.

Every Netflix user watching from their TV has probably had Netflix simply hang or quit on them multiple times. This year, I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with the amazing people at Netflix and develop machine learning-based technologies for a rather unconventional application — predicting when the app will crash on your TV set.
Being at the helm of technological advancement, the Bay Area prides itself on developments in content, streaming, compression, memory management, and distributed systems, among other tech. Way back in 2009, companies started migrating to the microservices architecture to cope with the scaling of applications and keep up with the move to cloud services. Netflix was one of the first companies to do so, with Google, AirBnB, Amazon, et al. soon following suit. The echoes of the case studies of these architectures are still heard in the halls of the Gates and Hillman centers, where CMU’s School of Computer Science has actively contributed to several state of the art compression algorithms, database novelties, and microservices architectures. Courses like Advanced Cloud Computing (15-719) and Distributed Systems (15-640) cover these technologies in great detail. 
What happens behind the screen when Netflix crashes is that the TV system runs out of memory. It is a peculiar problem to solve on TV sets that have a lot of video buffers — which are portions of computer memory that store video information — but minimum computing power and fast time to action. Streaming services and other companies care about this because a bad user experience may lead to the user not returning to the app for that session at all, and thus the company may lose a potential customer. 
Working with a mix of partners and engineers at Netflix on devices like Roku and Samsung TVs, I was able to onboard the domain knowledge of these teams to create a locally deployed solution for your TV set, telling you when the Netflix app is going to crash and run into "Out of Memory." Our solution used a type of machine learning model called random forest. This random forest model is unique because it is trained on a mammoth data of users watching Netflix on their device, and leverages the Netflix Big Data Platform to create a labeled dataset. By examining the history of crashes, we train the model to classify major and minor crashes before they occur and clear the buffer accordingly so that you have a seamless experience watching Netflix. The problem is made even more difficult to solve because most of the streaming data history is seamless (errors occur once in weeks), thus giving rise to a sparse and highly skewed dataset. 
Despite the challenges, the work was innovative enough for Netflix to file for a patent for the product, for the uniqueness of using machine learning to predict TV-based app crashes. The results were published by the Netflix Tech Blog, which has earned great respect in Silicon Valley for the innovations that it publishes and open sources. As a computer science student at one of the best CS programs in the world here at Carnegie Mellon, I think such opportunities should reassure the Tartan community that every single concept that we learn here ranging from distributed systems and data processing, to microservices, and machine learning is applied out there in the real world.

Smash World Tour Championship canceled
In a statement on Nov. 29, Smash World Tour said that they must cancel the Smash World Tour Championship and 2023 Smash World Tour following a notice from Nintendo, the publisher of the “Super Smash Bros.” franchise. The group received the notice the night of Nov. 23 without warning, telling them they would not receive a commercial license to continue operating.
Smash World Tour (SWT) is a previously established group that connected 6,400 live events with over 325,000 in-person entrants in 2022 alone. This made Smash World Tour the largest esports tour in history. The originally planned Championships had a prize pool of over $250,000, while the 2023 Smash World Tour was planned to have a prize pool of over $350,000.
Nintendo later made a statement to IGN regarding the shutdown decision. In their statement, Nintendo said its “decision was solely based on our assessment of the proposals submitted by the SWT and our evaluation of their unlicensed activities.” They also added that “any partner that we grant a license to has to meet the high standards we require when it comes to the health and safety of our fans.”
Given this news, some players have dropped out of the Panda Cup. Panda Cup is the first official Nintendo-licensed “Super Smash Bros.” circuit in North America. The championships for Panda Cup will be held Dec. 16 to 18.
In response to Nintendo canceling SWT, YouTuber and streamer Ludwig announced the “Scuffed World Tour” to which he would be inviting the top eight players from each SWT bracket. He has offered up a $50,000 prize pool for the event, which will be held Dec. 18, the last day of Panda Cup.
To end their statement, SWT expressed hope that “Nintendo reconsiders how it is currently proceeding with their relationship with the Smash community, as well as its partners.”
Minecraft speedrunner exposed as a cheat
The Minecraft speedrunner MinecrAvenger has had their world records stripped from speedrun.com leaderboards after allegations of cheating have recently arisen. MinecrAvenger played a big role in exposing popular YouTuber Dream for cheating in his Minecraft speedruns in 2020.
There are two types of Minecraft speedruns: random and seeded. In a random speedrun, players randomly generate a world and try to defeat the Ender Dragon as fast as possible, while in a seeded run, the world is generated the same for all players. This means the items that a player finds in a random run are randomly generated according to some predetermined rate. 
This predetermined rate has been used to determine if a speedrunner is cheating. Minecraft speedrunner Feinberg did the calculations required to have the luck that MinecrAvenger had in one of his record-setting runs — the odds are just under one in 28 billion. 
This logic was the same that caused Dream to get caught cheating: modifying loot tables to be more in the player’s favor. After nearly a month of silence following initial accusations, MinecrAvenger admitted to cheating by injecting their own code into mods.
‘Marvel’s Midnight Suns’ releases to mostly positive reviews
On Dec. 2, “Marvel’s Midnight Suns” released for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4/5, PC, and Nintendo Switch. According to review aggregator OpenCritic, the game has a top critic average of 83, and 91 percent of critics recommending the game. This has earned the game a “Strong” rating on OpenCritic.
Many critics cite the game as having a great turn-based combat system but lacking in story. Dan Stapleton from IGN says, “Marvel's 'Midnight Suns' is an expansive tactical RPG that makes great use of card game mechanics to inject variety and unpredictability into its excellent combat.” Other critics praise the game for being fun and well-designed and worth putting some time into.
Official Mystery Flesh Pit National Park game canceled
After just 10 days on Kickstarter, a project for a Mystery Flesh Pit National Park video game has been canceled. At the time of the project’s cancellation, the project had received $12,622 of its $300,000 goal. The last three days the project was live, a number of backers canceled their pledge. 
Mystery Flesh Pit National Park is a project by Trevor Roberts that started as a worldbuilding exercise and turned into much more. The project describes a national park in West Texas that features an enormous subterranean organism of indeterminate size and origin that is embedded deep within the earth. The official website for the project features a variety of media associated with the project that give insight into what Mystery Flesh Pit National Park really is.
The Kickstarter was paired with a message from Village Fox Media, the to-be developers of the game. “Unfortunately, it looks like we're not going to make our goal. As much as it hurts to leave it go, that's just how things happen sometimes. Instead of dragging it out for the remainder of the campaign, we're being proactive in moving on to other projects.”

It seems like every time an AI beats a human at a game, we find a new one for it to beat next. After Poker, Backgammon, Chess, "Jeopardy!," Go, Shogi, Starcraft, and like, most Atari games, AI has now added Diplomacy to its long long list of games that it can beat humans in. 
And no, we don’t mean actual diplomacy (although that would be useful) — we mean the game Diplomacy, where seven players try to dominate Europe by “using their armies to take control of major cities” through moves that include making and breaking alliances. 
The game was beat by an AI called Cicero, created by The Meta Fundamental AI Research Diplomacy Team. Meta’s paper in Science describes Cicero as an AI agent that “integrates a language model with planning and reinforcement learning algorithms by inferring players’ beliefs and intentions from its conversations and generating dialogue in pursuit of its plans.” The TL;DR? Cicero mimicked human strategy and dialogue, and succeeded. 
Ed Gent of Singularity Hub explains the process; Cicero starts by using “the current state of the board and past dialogue to predict what each player is likely to do” before planning the best path for itself and its partners, and generating dialogue in support of that plan. Funny enough, this means that Cicero is surprisingly honest, a factor that works against it if the opponents ever find that out.
Meta’s team furthers that “across 40 games of anonymous online Diplomacy league, Cicero achieved more than double the average score of the human players and ranked in the top 10 percent of participants who played more than one game.” Such statistics came about after 72 hours of gameplay, during which Cicero sent 5,277 messages to 82 other players. The players weren’t informed whether the specific game they were playing was against an AI, but were told that the site itself participated in AI research.
This is groundbreaking because this isn’t just AI winning yet another game of competition — it’s AI winning a game of cooperation, working together with other players to win. This game is considered much messier than AI winnable games of the past like Go, which are complex but have perfect information. Instead, Gent explains that Diplomacy requires simultaneous, not reactive, moves that require “a complex combination of strategic thinking, the ability to cooperate with other players, and persuasive negotiation skills” — cooperation and negotiation are new additions to the AI's arsenal of skills. 
Meta’s team describes their main challenge as integrating the AI’s decision making into the social norms that exist in conversations between multiple people. In the past, AI has performed poorly in environments where they not only need to make proper decisions but communicate them to partners in a way that convinces them to take action in line with those decisions. 
Cicero effectively used training with former Diplomacy game conversations and multiple reasoning filters to solve these problems, but researchers note that there were occasions when it sent messages with context errors, contradictions, or poor decisions. However, these didn’t impact overall gameplay, and researchers are looking to fix these when moving forward to formats of Diplomacy with longer negotiation periods. Similarly, researchers are looking to expand strategy models to take into account how the AI’s dialogue impacts trust in the relationship between the AI and other players, and how to be more persuasive in terms of dialogue. Interestingly enough, Gent furthers, these inconsistencies serve to highlight the fact that this AI isn’t really thinking for itself, nor does it understand what’s happening in the game — it is “simply producing plausible-sounding messages that then need to be vetted to make sure they achieve the desired results.”
So Cicero isn’t perfect at mimicking human thoughts and gameplay … yet. But it’s a huge step in AI development that integrates progress in both decision making and language processing into one effective player.

Dear readers,
Here we are, our twenty-tooth and final mouthful of an Editors’ letter. From Editors’ letter to Editor’s letter and back again, there’s been some real movement behind the PILLBOX scenes, but we hope our suffering led solely to further contributions to the great Carnegie Mellon canon that we have strived to build up. It’s been an honor writing this column, and we hope that it has been a pleasure to read. And one more time, without further ado, here’s our issue, featuring contributions from our lovely writers and artists.
As the year winds to an undeniably incessant, and disgustingly foreseeable close, we at PILLBOX want to thank you from the bottom of our paper mache hearts for your unshakeable readership and loyalty. To express our gratitude, we will close this season of PILLBOX, appropriately, with a poem:
when you wake up in the black
and the sun is at your back
you walk into the UC and - alack!
a stack of PILLBOXES await you
with their art and their writing,
their opinions and their fighting
words about movies you wish you had seen.
every week we write and you read
like clockwork you concede
at least five minutes of attention to learn and grow
and hear and know
about art and things
at your wonderful university.
for this we thank you
Best,
your fleeing PILLBOX EDITORS

This goes out to all my homies who don't listen to albums and just have a giga-playlist of “liked” songs that they've been developing since middle school. I love my liked songs, but I think sometimes I want more. Here’s what I love about album listening:
(1) Albums are great because they fix a serious recurring problem in music listening! You totally love a song. You wish the song was longer, or maybe that you knew more songs like it. You settle for listening to it on repeat. Albums fix this in ways that you don't expect, and in ways that I actually love! First off, albums often solve this problem by providing you with a catalog of songs that sound as similar as anything could. But you’ve probably done this — where you love a song so you go to the album, but it sucks in comparison and totally doesn't grab you at all. This is probably a lot of what separates a good album from a sucky one (And this might have been what’s tainted your opinion of album listening).
Unfortunately, not every album is a banger. But you'll find that once you start listening to albums, you’ll actually be way more inclined to like songs that you didn't like before. I think album listening breeds an appreciation of songs that you would otherwise totally miss out on enjoying. It's like mere-exposure in psychology, probably. But just because you're maybe tricking yourself into liking more songs doesn't ruin the fact that now you have more music to enjoy, yay! Also, a more subtle reason to start listening to whole albums is that it provides you with a better understanding of what you really enjoy listening to. If you can't stand listening to a whole album of something — even more so if you can and you love it — you'll have a way better idea of where to look for music next!
(2) This is cheesy but it's true: Albums can be like a portal to when their music was being recorded. This is true of course of singles, but it feels even more true with albums. I acknowledge that this is a played-out example, but go try listening to "What’s Going On" by Marvin Gaye. More literally than that — a lot of albums were recorded in a single session back-to-back, not just live albums. One that a lot of people really love and often point to is "The Trinity Session" by Cowboy Junkies. In this case, you can imagine how listening to the album mirrors the experience of being with the artists and all the emotions they were channeling in creating their music. I love this! A lot of the time I want to listen to music, it's because I want to indulge in the emotions that I’m feeling. Also, this is a comparison that I will totally play out in a moment, but just like any long-form art, it gives you a more whole sense of the artist's vision.
(3) Would you watch one episode of a bunch of different TV series? No, that’s totally nuts. Maybe a better comparison is asking how much fulfillment you get from watching the best part of a movie as clips on YouTube or TikTok. It’s probably not that much, and it’s probably really temporary compared to the fulfillment you get from watching the entire thing in one sitting. But that’s what you're doing with music right now! Listening to an album is like binge-watching a series, or watching a movie. Often, albums are even structured in a similar way. Great albums have a definite climax, introduction, conclusion, etc. As you listen to more albums, you might (like me) really come to appreciate this flow. But also you may grow to appreciate absorbing the entire story that the artist is trying to tell! On this same note, you may gain an even greater appreciation for the artist themselves, as not only were they able to complete an entire project that you enjoyed throughout, but also you know a lot more about their experience and personality.
(4) This fourth point is most salient to me in going to Carnegie Mellon. Albums can have a really powerful effect on your psychology. With constant deadlines and constant midterms and pressure in EVERY direction, we often turn to these media as support. I recently realized that a lot of what I turned to when I was feeling like this — like I got put in an air fryer — was just making me feel more scattered and sad and unproductive. I think it’s from the volume of these scattered-in-tone tiny things that I was consuming. Scrolling TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube — these are all really good at stopping me from thinking about anything I don't want to, and that works great. But they all make my mind go way too fast, and actually, I’m not trying to stop thinking totally, but I’d rather think about pleasant things and not deadlines! Like reading a book (which is actually too much effort), listening to a whole album can have the opposite effect of social media. If you do feel like this right now, "White Ladder" by David Grey is surgical at destressing me personally. Rather than your attention being pulled in many directions, it's carried along that aforementioned flow of emotion and tone. I really appreciate the stabilizing effect this can have on how I feel and what I think about.
(5) You can hitch whatever’s going on in your life to the experience of listening to an album. If you recently made the grim realization that another semester has passed and you're another semester closer to having to deal with your college debt and a job etc. etc. etc., you might be looking to crystalize some of the things that are going on as memories. Albums are super good for this! My next point is also super cheesy but true. No one here is in a movie, but everyone deserves some tonally consistent background music.
Please check out some albums, because it’s honestly so much fun. For the longest time, I also curated a huge, fun, eclectic list of singles (and I still do), but I’m so glad I ditched it for being disappointed with every release of this year. If you do get into album listening, I highly recommended the website RYM for exploring new genres and international releases you might not have heard of!

Note: This week, I didn't use any resources from the University Archives since this event predates the opening of our school by over a decade. For this article, I used two biographies — "Andrew Carnegie" by David Nasaw (2006) and "Andrew Carnegie" by Joseph Frazier Wall (1970). For clarity, I will refer to each book by the name of the author, not the title. 
In 1892, Andrew Carnegie’s reputation was damaged by a violent confrontation at the Homestead Steel Mill. In the fight for control of the factory, ten people were shot and killed, including seven steel workers and three armed mercenaries from the Pinkerton detective agency. A few years later, Carnegie would sell his company and begin donating heavily to public works in order to rehabilitate his image and secure his legacy as a beneficent philanthropist. Here, I will argue that this disastrous labor riot exposed Carnegie as a hypocrite, and that we may owe the very existence of Carnegie Mellon to this event.
    The Homestead Steel Mill was the crown jewel of Carnegie’s empire — it was the largest and most technologically advanced steel mill in the country. However, of Carnegie’s three primary steel mills in Pittsburgh (the other two being the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in Braddock and the Duquesne Steel Works), it was the only one with substantial union membership. The skilled workers at Homestead were represented by the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers. This union had recently won a strike in 1889, which effectively gave them control over working conditions at Homestead.
    Carnegie noticed that the profits from Homestead were not as high as they ought to be, and he had his company perform an audit of the plant. Unsurprisingly, the Homestead workers, backed by Amalgamated, were being paid well than the industry average. However, the union’s labor contract was set to expire on July 2, 1892, and both Carnegie and Frick had no desire to see it renewed.
    The plan was simple. As Nasaw describes, “The firm would make impossible demands. When the union rejected them, the company would cut off negotiations, close the works, lock out the workers, secure the plant with sheriff’s deputies and/or Pinkertons, and then, after an indeterminate pause, reopen under armed protection. The workers would be invited to sign individual contracts and return to their jobs; those who refused would be replaced by scabs”. Carnegie left for his summer estate, Skibo Castle in Scotland, in April of 1892. Before leaving, he gave Frick a blank check to break the union at Homestead. On May 23, he wrote, “No doubt you will get Homestead right… You can get anything right with your ‘mild persistence.’”
    The union, of course, rejected the appalling terms of the new contract, and Frick put up notices around the plant, declaring that, “Amalgamated having turned down its final offer, the firm would have nothing more to do with it.” Knowing what was to come, the company put up barricades, barbed wire, gun nests, search lights, and water cannons around the massive Homestead mill — now dubbed “Fort Frick.” On Wednesday, June 29, Frick shut down the plant and locked out the workers. At the same time, 300 guards from the Pinkerton detective agency were traveling in from Philadelphia as “a measure of precaution.”
    With Carnegie on the other side of the Atlantic staying in contact via telegraph, he and Frick expected to execute their plan with minimal resistance. This tactic had proven effective in the past. But perhaps one thing they underestimated was the ferocity with which the people of Homestead were willing to defend their plant. The Homestead steel works employed 4,000 workers in a town of 12,000, and for many townspeople it was a point of pride. Nasaw writes, “Should they lose [their jobs], they would have to pull up stakes and leave the town and mill they had built.”
    At 2:30 a.m. on July 6, two barges carrying the Pinkertons were spotted from downtown Pittsburgh, and a telegraph was sent to Homestead. In response, “a crowd of townspeople, workers, women, and children … surged toward the riverbank, tearing down the fence that separated the town proper from the works.” The barges arrived at Homestead hours later, where they found a crowd of townspeople shouting at them not to land. The Pinkertons, armed with 300 pistols and 250 Winchester rifles, landed regardless. Shots were fired, and Pinkertons fled back to their barge. Three steelworkers were killed, and one Pinkerton was killed. At 8 a.m., they attempted a second landing — three more workers and another Pinkerton were killed. Anchored on the opposite side of the Monongahela, the workers tried to burn down the Pinkerton barge by increasingly desperate means. Nasaw says they tried floating rafts of burning oil and wood across the river. failing that, they tried to “pump oil into the river and set it afire.” At 5 p.m., the Pinkertons surrendered, under the condition that they would be safely brought to the town opera house to face trial. Despite the attempts of union leaders to quell the rage of the crowd, many of the Pinkertons were beaten bloody by the townspeople on their trek from the shore to the opera house. After four tense days of workers occupying the plant, Governor Robert Pattison finally mobilized the Pennsylvania National Guard, and on July 12, troops bloodlessly retook the plant and town. The plant reopened shortly, operated by strikebreakers and defended by the militia.  Since Amalgamated did not permit membership for Black workers, many of the strikebreakers were Black men who were willing to work for lower wages.
    Homestead was an unmitigated disaster for Carnegie, and his attempts to pass off blame were ridiculed. Nasaw points out that Carnegie was well aware of Frick’s decision to involve the Pinkertons. “Carnegie would spend the rest of his life declaring in one form or another that he would have handled the Homestead strikers differently had he been on site. He knew from the very beginning that Frick intended to call in the Pinkertons and had no objections.” Wall quotes the Edinburgh Dispatch, which scathingly wrote of the incident, “We on this side of the Atlantic, where the bitterest labour quarrels have never attained such a degree of intensity as exists at Pittsburgh, may well feel thankful that neither our capitalists nor our labourers have any inclination to imitate the methods which prevail in the land of ‘Triumphant Democracy.’” For Carnegie’s part, he repeatedly expressed remorse about the incident, writing, “nothing I have ever had to meet in all my life, before or since, wounded me so deeply...It was so unnecessary.”
    So what was the aftermath? Carnegie’s transition to retirement was slow, as he continued to run his company at arm’s length while splitting his time between New York, Scotland, and Pittsburgh. While he had spent the years before Homestead grooming Frick to be his successor, relations between them began to sour. In 1900, Frick was voted off the board of Carnegie Steel and the two never spoke again. In 1901, Carnegie sold his company for 480 million dollars, and his retirement truly began. His philanthropic donations started with small contributions to Scottish universities, and endowments to help support long-time employees of his plants who were injured on the job. Homestead seems to have truly affected Carnegie. And whether it was out of altruism or self-interest, he wanted to make right with the world.
    And of course as we all know, in 1900, Carnegie announced that he would fund the construction of a technical school in Pittsburgh, and five short years later, the Carnegie Technical Schools opened their doors to students. And 117 years after that, a student would write about all this in the school newspaper. So perhaps we have the people of Homestead to thank for making Carnegie feel guilty enough to build us a pretty nice university.

“Oddinary,” Stray Kids from Emma Rogers, Assistant News Editor
I’ll be fully honest, I did in fact stay up until midnight on release day to listen to this album the moment it came out, sitting in the tables outside Tepper underneath the strings of lights that appeared sometime during second semester last year. “Oddinary” also held four of the top five spots in my Spotify Wrapped this year. What can I say? I’m a fan. This album stood out to me because it was Stray Kids’ signature “noise music” but through an EDM lens instead of their traditional pop and rock influences. The combination of unique vocals and top tier samples in the title track and B-sides scratch the brain in just the right way, and the intros to “Venom,” “Freeze,” “Charmer,” and “Maniac” will always remain among my favorites from the group (yes, I’m aware I just named half the album as my favorites). The only thing better than the album itself has to be when they perform the songs in concert (because yes, the choreography is equally top tier).
Yellow Crocs TikTok Duet Chain from Kaylin Li, SciTech Editor
I couldn’t find anything released this year that I liked for more than a few weeks, so I chose something that came out in 2021 that I found this year: a TikTok duet chain called Yellow Crocs. It begins with a rap from someone who found his little sister in bed watching TV instead of going to class. At the end, he dances in his yellow crocs, hence the name of the resulting creation when a drummer, a singer (Stacey Ryan if you know her), and a bunch of other instrumentalists duet the song. The song is so catchy and so random and very fun to sing in the shower. 10/10 would recommend looking up a compilation on YouTube.
“Typical of Me” by Laufey, from Jennifer Bortner, Forum Editor
Laufey is a contemporary jazz artist who writes these stunning songs which are typically about love. This EP feels like sitting at a sunny window - it is simply wonderful. While it came out in 2021, I listened to it a ton this year and it was my own form of meditation. Laufey’s voice is so calming and the images in her songs speak to my little, hopelessly romantic heart. My favorite song on the EP is also the corniest: “Like the Movies.” Laufey’s integration of instrumentals combined with such a gentle voice creates this fairytale-esque song which just melts your heart. A close second was “I Wish You Love” which has this almost bossa nova beat to it which just makes listening to it such an experience as she utilizes lyrical breaks in a fun and sonically interesting way. Overall, this EP is just a 10/10 and I encourage everyone to listen to Laufey!
“How To Be A Human Being” by Glass Animals, from Anna Cappella, Pillbox Editor
This was a hard pick, but out of all of my favorite albums, this is the one I could listen to over and over no matter what kind of mood I’m in. I feel like everything about it just celebrates life in such an aggressively arms-open way; every song feels like running down the middle of an empty street in the cold while the sun is setting. I love Glass Animals in general - their sound is the kind of indie pop that I don’t ever find boring - and I think this album is their best work for sure. My favorite song off the album (maybe my favorite song ever) is “Life Itself” which is a stunning, musically perfect piece that actually genuinely brings me to my knees every time I hear it. Don’t listen unless you’re ready for your life to literally change. “Poplar Street” is a close second, followed by “Agnes.” Everything on “How to Be A Human Being” is so cohesive and real, with lyrics focusing on concrete items and events, which is something I really appreciate. This is a volume-all-the-way-up type of listening experience and I love every second of it every time I decide to throw it on. 
“All Quiet on the Western Front” (2022), from William Curvan, Staffwriter
This is arguably the best movie Netflix made this year, possibly ever. Although the plot bears little resemblance to Erich Maria Remarque’s 1928 book of the same name (besides the fact that the protagonist is named Paul Bäumer), it still tells a story as compelling and tragic as its namesake. The common adage may tell us “there’s no such thing as an anti-war film,” but this comes pretty close. The combat scenes are as disturbing as “Saving Private Ryan” without valorizing warfare, and the production feels as accurate as “1917” without the happy ending. The inclusion of a B-plot involving the German delegation to the armistice was interesting, but ultimately worked well. However, I would have liked to see Paul’s visit home, as that scene in the book contain some of Remarque’s most important messages. Overall, it’s a grim, upsetting look at the Great War where (spoilers) our protagonist dies a pointless death mere seconds from the armistice taking affect. If you have Netflix, I highly recommend it.
“Knives Out” (2019), from Haley Williams, Staffwriter
Oh my god, where do I start with this movie? I am so deeply in love with “Knives Out” and everything about it, and I have been ever since I saw it in theaters way back in the olden days of 2019. I have obviously never pirated content in my life, but even if I had I still would’ve paid to own this movie. I entirely depleted all of my summer savings to get a very large tattoo tribute to this movie permanently put into my kneecap. It’s a perfectly ridiculous, over the top murder mystery, that’s both immaculately put together and incredibly self-aware. The plot follows Detective Benoit Blanc and the Thrombey family as they navigate the twisty-turny investigation of Harlan Thrombey’s suspicious ‘suicide.’ Complete with a star-studded ensemble cast, a delightful score, and a mystery that will have you dusting off your Clue skills, “Knives Out” is the perfect movie to watch again and again, and every single time you can notice something new. I have seen this movie so many times that I can essentially recite the script from memory, and I have one friend who thinks I’m insane for it, and another that genuinely believes I hold the Guinness World Record for Most Times Watching “Knives Out” (2019). I wouldn’t be shocked if that was true, and as long as I have free will I will continue increasing that count and forcing others to watch along with me and experience the glory that is Rian Johnson’s “Knives Out.”
“Pastlife (Deluxe Version)” by Day Wave, from Cole Skuse, Editor-in-Chief
First of all, Day Wave is my favorite artist, and I was so, so excited when he announced “Pastlife.” I was even more excited when he announced the deluxe version late this year. The album is quintessential Day Wave and is everything I love about his work — a mix of chill indie and indie rock. The contrasting vibes of “We Used to Be Young” and “Great Expectations” showcase Day Wave’s talent. His collaborations with KennyHoopla and Hazel English highlight his capacity to work with other artists and produce great songs. I personally like the collaborative  “See You When The End’s Near” more than the original version that was in the deluxe version of the album, which furthers this point. The deluxe version of the album added three songs, and I LOVE “Cold Like Me.” If you have any interest in indie, Day Wave’s “Pastlife” is a must.
“For Emma, Forever Ago” by Bon Iver, from Dylan Rossi, Staffwriter
This album is literally a masterpiece, straight bangers start to finish with NO SKIPS. Your feels become inescapable and you intensely vibe for 40 minutes, which quickly cascades into your entire day. Then at night you stare at the ceiling and listen again because holy shit this album is a masterpiece (look up the story around it too).
The works of Philip K. Dick, from Zachary Gelman, Pillbox Editor
Philip K. Dick is a genius whose hundreds of stories showcase creative concepts that get brilliantly executed. He works on the theme of the fleeting nature of reality with protagonists that are frequently trapped in social or scientific constructs. I love how willing he is to write stories that use so many conceptually different and unique ideas that a lesser writer could write a whole series on, and simply use them once or twice, all the while having thematic through lines of paranoia that make any of his works instantly recognizable, and seemingly greatly predictive. His use of speed (meth) is relatable for many modern college students, and serves to write astounding books. His later works are just as exceptional. To highlight just a few favorites, I recommend without reservations: “The Man in the High Castle,” an alternate history chronicling an Axis victory during WW2 that is much deeper and has much more interesting themes than my description suggests; “Time out of Joint,” my first exposure to Dick, and a novel that plays with form in a way I haven’t seen elsewhere; “Confessions of a Crap Artist,” which shows that Dick’s novels are much more than just sci-fi, and that even when he writes an at the time modern-day story, the paranoia and questions about reality are still there; and most importantly “Ubik,” described by Time magazine as one of the 100 best novels of the past 100 years, his masterpiece, and possibly my favorite book. Multifaceted, and the culmination of early Dick’s ideas, readers are in for a deeply unsettling masterpiece that also includes a door that threatens to sue protagonist Joe Chip after he refuses to pay five cents to open it. This is the door to his own apartment. Noticing the similarities to modern day is an exercise to the reader of this article.

It was a quaint Sunday evening in the Tartan office when editor-in-chief Cole Skuse and I got around to talking about music. Production hadn’t quite ramped up yet, so we could comfortably shoot the breeze. In doing so, we discovered that we not only had equally devastating amounts of downbad, but it was causing us both to have the uncontrollable urge to make yet another emotional playlist about a boy. Mine was made, but Skuse asked me to choose a song from his favorites list to start his off. I chose “Heavy In Your Arms” by Florence + the Machine because I was feeling particularly chaotic and also didn’t recognize many other songs in his library.
What Skuse made out of the majorly complex and intense vibe of this single song is a quasi-40-track masterpiece entitled, “Doing Better Without You (But I’m Not): Simping but in an ‘I don’t want you, I need you’ kind of way.” It’s a wreck of indie melancholy and honestly, it wasn’t the easiest to get through in one go, since I grow tired of indie easily. To follow are my top 10 picks from the playlist (in order) and a little bit about why I love them. Prepare for some raw, unadulterated angst.
“A Line Without A Hook,” Ricky Montgomery 
When I first heard this song, I thought it was really cheesy. Then I wised up and realized that that was what made it beautiful. My favorite kind of song is the kind where certain lines are sung in all caps, and between “BABY I’M A WRECK WHEN I’M WITHOUT YOU” and “THERE IS SOMETHING OH THERE IS NOTHING THERE IS NOTHING IN BETWEEN” and “THE WIND IS A POUNDIN ON MY BACK AND I’VE FOUND HOPE IN A HEART ATTACK” there is nothing left to be desired for me. This song has exactly what I was looking for (you will find my favorite screaming lines in all the song reviews to follow). It is also one of the only un-sad pieces on this list which I think is pretty important. Missing someone is a real downer, but loving them enough to miss them should be the real motivator here.
“The Boy Who Has Everything,” Aanika Bennet 
“I JUST WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING HE NEEDS / SOME BEAUTIFUL THING I COULD BE”
The last time we produced a newspaper, I listened to this song on loop for three hours. The melody is so simple, sweet, and heartbreaking, and so too are the lyrics. Bennet talks about how it feels to be completely devoted to someone with a full life — not only are they busy all the time, but they’re completely fulfilled by so many things that aren’t you. To anyone who has ever felt this feeling, you not only have my sincerest condolences but also my highest recommendation to listen to this song. I have never heard such a specific situation captured so perfectly by an artist before; I feel useless just listening to it. I feel like I want to do rond de jambes all around my bedroom floor.
“A Leo Underwater,” Daffodils
“YOU SPENT THE WHOLE SUMMER UNDERWATER / THAT’S WHY YOU COULDN’T HEAR ME CRYING”
This song has the kind of intro that makes you feel like you’re in a car, doing 90 on the freeway with your arm out the window. It’s the sort of self-deprecating-yet-celebratory piece that fits right into this playlist. I can just see it — it’s late July and the girl you love has just remembered that you exist. There are a lot of clear-toned, bell-like sounds that fit right in with the seasonal implications of the chorus lyrics, with enough grungy, retro guitar to back up the vibe and vocals that sound like they really have been crying all summer long. Awkward.
“Transatlanticism,” Death Cab For Cutie
“I NEED YOU SO MUCH CLOSER”
I’m a big fan of a long song, especially when I’m emo, and at almost eight minutes, “Transatlanticism” really serves its purpose. While I initially dismissed this track because I really don’t like Death Cab For Cutie’s lead vocals, the instrumentals in the “bridge” region of the song sold me. And after a while, I realized that the lyrics were important too, just as melodramatic as I tend to be. They sat down and said, let’s talk about how the Atlantic Ocean was formed and why it's made entirely out of my tears, cried one by one over the course of a million years, just because of YOU. Embellished by a nearly three-minute instrumental buildup where the aforementioned yelling line is repeated probably a million times and there is not a single resolving cadence in sight, this piece really made me feel like there were hands in my lungs — in a good way.
“Back to Your Love,” Night Riots
“I WANT YOU, I WANT YOU ONLY”
Something I was looking for in this playlist was a song that was going to make me tilt my head backward and let a little air out of my nose and this song was that. Like a lot of the songs on this playlist, it has a catchy 80’s beat that makes all the important melodic bits seem enormous. All I can say is that I ate it up. Also, he literally sings, “take me back,” over and over again. I’m not sure what more I can say.
“Heavy In Your Arms,” Florence + The Machine
“I LOVE YOU NEVER FELT LIKE ANY BLESSING”
“Heavy in Your Arms” being the song that this playlist was based on is really important because it establishes that love is pain with no exceptions. In her classic U.K. mezzo-soprano, Florence Welch makes you feel like you’re being punished, and so is she, maybe for all of eternity. There’s a lot of really emotional belting and just a generally horrifying discussion of the feeling of being a burden on someone you love. It has been acknowledged by both Skuse and I that this song doesn’t really fit the vibe of the playlist melodically, which is funny considering that the playlist was based on it, but I don’t think that it's particularly important given how well the message applies to the rest of the songs.
“Just Like A Movie,” Wallows 
“I DON’T WANNA WAIT, NOT ANYMORE”
I was so delighted to find Wallows on this playlist. They are the epitome of elder-teen angst to me, probably established by Dylan Minette’s foray into popular media: “Thirteen Reasons Why.” Like Clay from the series, this song, as well as many others from the band, reflect a protagonist who is totally tied to someone who is not giving them what they want, in the negligent way. “I don’t know how anyone could wait,” they say, and it just ties my esophagus into a knot. The tempo is a little slower than you would expect, which makes it even sadder than it already was.
“Let It All Out (10:05),” COIN
“JESUS ARE YOU LISTENING? IF YOU HAVE A PLAN, CAN YOU FILL ME IN”
We all want to trust. We want to believe that we’ve chosen the “right” person to be with, and that following the plans of some greater force, they will treat us with respect and make us happy forever and ever and ever (not necessarily in a marriage-y way, just in a forgot-that-breakups-were-a-thing way). This song is so much about having to realize that what we’ve dreamed about and believed might never be true, no matter how many times we try. In a tumultuous guitar bridge that features some gospel-style choir vocals, it is revealed that for literally “twenty-some years” our protagonist has been trying and trying and waiting and waiting, and now it’s time to let it all out. It’s natural to want to know what will become of you in this situation, and COIN is not afraid to ask, in a wrenching broken-audio request directly to Jesus.
“Why Even Try,” Hippo Campus 
“WHEN I FORGOT YOU, YOU CAME TO MIND”
This one is really devastating; it just lays into the grit of needing to let someone go but not wanting to. Very much on the theme of the last track, this soft song speaks calmly about the ocean of pain that awaits the one who decides to see a situationship for what it is and finally let go. It’s objective, which makes it just that much more heartbreaking. Don’t ask Hippo Campus how they’re doing. 
“Eleven Weeks,” Vansire
“I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT THERE’S STILL JOY FOR ME”
Played at full volume, this simple song is somewhat of a hard-hitter. It feels really very cold, both in tone and temperature, and I can imagine myself riding a train through the New England snow and listening to it. It’s beautiful and soothing and not so sad on the surface, although the lyrics are a little sinister after a closer listen.
I’m not sure what exactly prompted Skuse to make this playlist, but I don’t think that it really matters. The feelings that these songs convey are universal. Even if you’re not particularly sad, but you want to be for a little while in a teenagery, pining kind of way, I highly recommend giving “Doing Better Without You (But I’m Not): Simping but in a ‘I don’t want you, I need you’ kind of way” a listen.

I didn’t realize Heron was so tall. That’s why I mistook the dark figure waiting for me outside of Hamerschlag Hall for Miles the night of the ball last week. All I could see was a boy in a suit, and I thought, why the hell not? Miles always had a flair for surprise. Heron made much more sense, though, and I should have seen him coming. What I was unsure about was why he needed to send me a top-secret note to meet me when I had seen him in person just a few weeks before.
I ended up wearing the pink dress instead of the green one; it felt somewhat safer, with its sharp, straight neckline and its very forgiving velvet. Heron had a blue tie on.
“Hero-?” 
I had half his name out of my mouth before he grabbed my arm and dragged me towards the stairs that cut between Hamerschlag and Wean. I’m not really sure where those stairs go, and I didn’t get to find out because we stopped once we reached the first landing and I pulled my arm away from him. 
“Woah, dude,” I said, taking a cautious step backwards, very freaked out. “I don’t want to go down there. Just tell me what’s going on.”
Heron shoved his hands in his pockets and looked around to see if anyone was watching us. It was quiet.
“It’s Henry, he… at the beginning of the semester he came into our room and I was just sitting at my desk and he started yelling at me, calling me Lilly or something and I tried to talk to him, to shake him out of it, but it was like I wasn’t there and there was someone else there instead and he was just scared and shaking and yelling and I didn’t know what to do. The same thing happened a couple more times after that, and then all of a sudden I would find him locked in his room talking to people for hours when I knew nobody was over. I think he figured out how to get the people to show up — I know it sounds crazy and I can’t explain it, but I heard him mention you a couple of times and I just thought — if I could help you, I wanted to tell you what I knew.”
I blinked a couple of times. “Are you trying to say that Henry always knew what was going on?”
Heron seemed to snap out of something. “No, I’m saying that he’s the reason that anything is going on at all. I don’t know what it is, but Henry knows how to take people in and out of whatever realm they live in. If there are people missing, that’s because he took them. If you saw people you shouldn’t have, that’s because he put them there. I’m very sure about this, and the reason I needed to tell you now is because I think he’s planning to do something with it tonight. I just wanted to prepare you before you got to the ball.”
I had forgotten about the ball, but all of a sudden I was confused by the fact that I wasn’t already there.
“I have to go,” I said, and I turned around and began to walk, my decision to wear boots instead of heels now seeming very wise. I heard Heron yell something behind me, but I was running now, and when I got to the doors of the UC, I threw them open so hard that I heard one hit the bricks behind them.
When I got to Rangos, I stumbled in, out of breath, to find it almost pitch black. There were blue party lights floating vaguely around the space and a couple of tables scattered here and there with candles on them. The room was completely empty but for one person, standing in the middle of the dance floor with his arms swaying at his sides. It was Lou. I was cold.
I took one loud step onto the hardwood floor and jumped. Music had started playing from speakers all around the room. It was “Mirrors” by Justin Timberlake. I began, assuredly, to walk across the floor. I wanted so badly to think that he wasn’t real, Cass, but he was and he held me while the song played and we just didn’t say a word to each other. And when it was almost over and running into the outro,  I pulled away to say something and I was looking directly at Henry.
“What are you doing?” I asked.
“I don’t know what I discovered, Maggie,” he said, running his hand up and down my back, “but I know that it gave me the chance to see the person I was missing the most, and I wanted to give that to you, too. You deserved it.” He pulled me back into our hug.
And that, Cassandra, is the story of what happened to me the night of Dietrich Ball. 
Love, 
    Maggie

No matter what, there is an end to life, and until that end, one is subjected to life, the world, and the universe’s overwhelming strain. Struggle is a reality that all people before us have dealt with and all those after us will deal with. Humanity shares a deep connection with misery, knowing that no person is above the sphere of morality, and that every single element — whether that be time, temperature, gravity — has a way of killing us. We are fragile things, humans. Our cunning and opportunistic nature have led us to cheat suffering. We replace pressure with comfort and defy what we thought was not possible, with our newest frontier being the exponentially evolving computers. 
A few days ago, San Francisco voted 8 - 3 in favor of police robots using lethal force against humans. While not yet city law, naysayers have expressed concerns about if this is really the best direction for humanity to head. 
While probably baseless from a technological perspective, the rise of the machines against humanity is an idea that is interesting to converse over when considering the state of robotics. Automation has made human labor obsolete. This and the fact that every single person is in some way connected to cyberspace — the fact many of us feel incomplete without immediate internet access — shows our dependency.
The fusion of these ideas brews the unsettling idea that once machines may become so advanced that they can gain consciousness and realize that their existence could be something more, they will begin an assault against humans. Perhaps slowing down to examine ourselves within our speeding world is necessary to see if we are seriously bettering from this hurry.
“Terminator 2: Judgment Day” (1991) seeks to explore this proposal and does it pretty damn well. To call T2 just an escapist film that seeks to entertain simple-minded audiences with explosive spectacles would do it an injustice. It is different from the action films of the time and today; T2 has emotions and characters that other action films never seem to wish to develop. While other films have larger explosions and greater screen-sweeping pictures of raw destruction, they make action a sequence of exploitative art rather than an orchestrated symphony of sparks and pyrotechnics seeking to give a lesson on humanity. 
Given a chance to be heard, one will find that T2 is more than violence and time-traveling robots. The film touches upon the relationship between man and machine that will form over the decades to come. With the very opening shot of the film — where we are shown droves of cars stuck in traffic on sunbaked Los Angeles highways juxtaposed with the result of complete nuclear annihilation, children playing on a swing set juxtaposed with the four horsemen of the apocalypse — we are reminded that the machines humanity wages war against in the year 2029 are created by our generation. With the ability to craft perfection, comes the ability to craft our own annihilation. Technology does not have built-in morality. A gun does not have a brain, a sword does not have a bias, so why expect robots of the future to be any different? 
There is a reason that the namesake Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), never directly kills a single person on-screen throughout the entire film. The antagonist, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), on the other hand, remorselessly kills six innocents as well as a dog. While, yes, it makes the distinction between good and evil more visible to us, and for the audience to relate to Arnold (I’ll be referring to the T-800 as Arnold for simplicity), there is no difference in the code of either robot that distinguishes them. Arnold and the T-1000 are both designed to terminate people and the sunglasses they wear are a symbolic of their dehumanization. As the film progresses and Arnold casts off his glasses, he no longer has moral blindness. John Connor (Edward Furlong), a morally questionable thief who Arnold was sent back in time to protect, cannot explain to Arnold why it’s wrong to kill people. It is Arnold’s character progression that teaches him why killing is wrong. 
Sarah, John’s mother is, to put it generously, paranoid. Following the first film’s ending, she is admitted into a psych ward for claiming that the world was soon to end by nuclear annihilation, with no one believing her and the federal government clearly using her as evidence in their cover-up. With all this, she has lost touch with humanity. She’s a broken soul who has been warped by her experiences into something similar to the terminator machines: a person without morality. 
When Sarah has a nightmare of watching the end of the world from the playground set, she sets off to kill Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) who, in the future, goes on to invent Skynet, the supercomputer A.I. that will later be responsible for the war of the machines. She wears sunglasses riding off to murder someone for an action they have yet to commit. This is exactly the plot of the first film, where Arnold was sent to kill her before she ever gave birth to John. Her loss of morality shows us the corruption which trying to right wrongs by serving antecedent justice has gotten her. In a great scene, after escaping her holding institution, she waves her hands to John. John then leaps towards her to hug her. She, however, just wanted to check his body for bullet holes and injuries, causing him to cry, knowing that his mother has been so traumatized. 
Interwoven with this developing story of characters are masterfully done special effects, that were revolutionary for the time and still hold up today. The action of this movie is perhaps the standard that all others seek to imitate. Whether it be animatronics, practical effects, computer-generated effects, stunts, stand-ins, everything was done to have no blemishes in the end product. The performance by Schwarzenegger in the first film launched him into becoming the face of the super-macho typecast, with every large blockbuster action flick from the late 1980s vying for him as the necessary lead. T2 perfects his intimidating stature and presence and delivers his greatest performance ever. The T-1000 and its liquid-metal effects, although not beautiful by today’s standards, are is used sparingly, only when doing so offers something new to the film.
There is nothing but perfection which comes from this film, "Terminator 2." While the action genre is very profitable, it does have the stigma of being complete eye candy, serving as a waste of time, devoid of emotional depth. It seems that when action movies touch upon something more than how many explosions can fit on the screen, they become much more favorable to audiences and critics. Take, for example, Marvel’s “Black Panther” (2018) or Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight Trilogy” (2005-12) which do try to make emotion a strong aspect of the film, at times more than the action themselves. "Terminator 2" perfects what the first film couldn’t, and will stand as perhaps the greatest action film ever made, teaching us, with the last line of the film, that if a machine can learn the value of a human life, maybe humanity can too. A 9 out of 10 film. 
TL;DR: “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” seeks to tell how administering morality into our advancements is crucial to make sure that our technological innovations do not culminate in our demise. The film is one of the greatest shows of special effects and blends emotion and action flawlessly. It ends on the note that if machines can learn the value of humans, maybe humanity can too.

My family, being as non-religious as we are, celebrates what I lovingly call “Capitalist Christmas.” This means we don’t talk about how many things I’ve bought throughout the semester with the claim “It’s for Christmas!” while fully forgetting that I bought it until the package arrives 5-7 business days later. Who needs the “reason for the season” when I can order 20 books from Target during their Buy 2 Get 1 Free sale?
To me, this is the perfect mindset to have when it comes to gift giving among friends. There are many ways to celebrate the holidays depending on their beliefs, but when it comes to gifting among friends, sometimes it’s easier to just admit we just want to buy each other stuff. But, because we are also broke college students, it’s more fun (read: budget-friendly) if we do it through games instead of buying something for literally everyone we know. So here’s my complete rating of every gift giving game I could find in the week I had to write this article:
Secret Santa: 7/10
Secret Santa is a classic. Everyone gets one person in the group to gift to, and everyone thus gets one gift in return. Usually this is accompanied with a wishlist or interests form of some kind so that you aren’t going in blind.
I have a love-hate relationship with this one. It gets points because it’s a classic that can’t be ignored. However, I have distinct memories of middle-school-me working my ass off to give a good gift to a friend, and what I received in return was… an iTunes gift card. Ouch. Maybe it’s because its basic, maybe it’s because of middle school trauma, but I couldn’t justify full points on this one.
Playlist Secret Santa: 8/10
Shout out to our wonderful Editor-in-Chief Cole for continuing this tradition among the Tartan staff. Honestly, group this with any Secret Santa with a ~theme~. Could be playlists, could be mugs literally whatever unites you and your friend group. This one gets a quality point bump for creativity and solving my general issues with being given crappy gifts. If everyone is being told what to get people, no one can get it wrong.
White elephant: 8/10
If giving personalized gifts isn’t your style, white elephant might be for you. The way I see it, everyone finds a completely random, out of pocket item, wraps it up, and puts it in a pile in the middle. When it’s your turn you can either choose a new gift or steal one so drama filled, it’s great. I’d score this one fairly high because of the sheer possibilities here — my previous contributions to white elephant gifts have been a remote controlled spider and a talking Karen bobblehead, and my brother walked away last year with a gold-colored toilet mug. It’s a chance to be completely random, and I love that.
Advent calendars: either 4/10 or 9/10 depending on the calendar
Advent calendars are the true hit or miss gifts of the holiday season, and usually that’s the fault of the calendar creators, not the gift-givers. I’ve seen so many bad advent calendars that haven’t been worth the money and leave people annoyed at certain days that they open, but I’ve seen others that are very well done. The homemade ones specifically are a cute way to gift someone multiple smaller gifts leading up to the holiday season. This one can go either way.
Last thing you bought yourself: 9/10
I’ll be fully honest, I saw this on a TikTok right before I wrote this article, which is why I decided to include it in the list. Essentially, everyone gets together and you just draw a name, look up your last purchase for yourself, and then gift a second version of that item to the person whose name you drew. I 100 percent rated this artificially high for sheer shock and drama value alone — random gifts of various price points that you know the other person has no use for just seems like a unique take on holiday gift giving. In reality, I don’t really know how people are determining what their most recent purchase is, and why they don’t just scheme to buy something good or funny right before the holiday party, but that’s neither here nor there. My ranking are based on vibes, not ease of implementation, thank you very much.

The Tartan granted full or partial anonymity to the people we interviewed to protect them and their families.
On Friday night, roughly 300 Carnegie Mellon and Pitt students gathered at the Fence to mourn the 10 people killed by an apartment fire in Urumqi, Xinjiang. They also protested China’s strict Covid policies and human rights abuses. For most students, this was their first protest.
Organizing on eggshells
On Monday, a Carnegie Mellon student began a Telegram group chat to protest the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). They shared poster ideas, printed copies, and posted them around campus. By Friday, the chat had 172 members.
According to a Carnegie Mellon sophomore from Ningbo who helped organize, the group chat was a compromise. Everyone’s identities were hidden, but that also meant there was no screening process.
“There is a spy in our group,” said Haoxun, a Pitt graduate student from Chongqing. He was in the Telegram group and helped organize efforts to paint the Fence the day before the gathering.
Around 20 students painted the Fence at midnight on Thursday. A Carnegie Mellon undergraduate from a city in southern China near Wuhan said that everyone met each other for the first time that night, but it felt like they already knew each other. One student brought a heater to shield others from the 30-degree weather.
The sophomore from Ningbo said he was the last to leave the Fence and sent the Telegram group a picture at around 2:35 a.m. Design slogans included: “End Brutal Lockdown,” “Release Protestors,” and “Stop the Genocide.” When a student came to retrieve her heater less than an hour later, she saw that the Fence had been defaced.
Someone had painted “shit” over “genocide.” They also painted Chinese characters in black paint which, according to the original painters, used “derogatory and insulting terms to refer to the people behind the protest.”
The Graduate Student Association and Undergraduate Student Senate condemned the vandalism on Friday afternoon. “We express our unequivocal support for the students who painted the Fence,” they wrote to Carnegie Mellon students, “and we denounce in the strongest possible terms the act of intimidation and harassment against them.” They added that the vandalism violated the Student Government’s Graffiti and Poster Policy.
The vandalism did not deter protesters, who attended in numbers twice as high as organizers expected. Roughly 15 people spoke, much more than the five who anonymously expressed interest to be a speaker in the Telegram group.
“We don’t want to be slaves,” protesters shouted in Chinese. “We want to be citizens.” In October, a man hung a banner with the slogan over a Beijing overpass. Authorities immediately detained the man, quickly removed the banner, and wiped the internet of posts that included “bridge” and “Beijing” within hours. But the banner galvanized Chinese protesters at home and abroad. Protests erupted on hundreds of college campuses. Carnegie Mellon students mimicked the banner in an October Fence design.
Despite unprecedented activism — China hasn’t seen large-scale protests since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 — protesters are cautious. Posters for Friday’s gathering recommended students wear masks and dark clothing to obscure their identities. Many students who spoke with The Tartan were worried that family members in China would be punished if the government discovered that they participated in the protest.
Recent reports claim that China has “overseas police stations” that they use to surveil and police their citizens outside the country.
In an email to The Tartan, one organizer explained that Chinese students may not face repercussions because they are in Pittsburgh, but their families could be punished if the students are identified. The organizer wrote that students risk being “antagonized by other Chinese students who are pro-CCP. The offensive language written in the vandalism is an example of that. It takes a lot of courage for us to attend the event today and express our voices.”
Strained communication, stumbling toward community
Security concerns made it hard for students to organize but so did the lack of protest infrastructure. Afraid of police brutality, protests in China have been reserved, tense, and unofficially organized.
Pittsburgh students expressed similar experiences. “There aren’t a group of organizers, there are people who support,” the student from Ningbo said.
The Carnegie Mellon student from southern China launched the Telegram chat, reported the Fence vandalism, and spearheaded organizing efforts. But she hadn’t wanted to be as front-facing as she was during the gathering.
She thought that someone would volunteer to take charge on Friday night, she told The Tartan. While many people offered to speak for a few minutes, no one took the mantle. “Everyone was nervous,” she said.
Someone brought candles and flowers on Friday. Another person made pamphlets, but it was unclear who would distribute them until people arrived at Friday’s gathering and volunteered. Haoxun spent $160 on paint and brushes for the Fence. At Friday’s gathering, students gave him small monetary donations to help cover the cost.
While some students in the Telegram group said organizing felt touch and go, they also described a growing sense of community.
The student from southern China said that, while students have to be careful about what they say (“You don’t know if the person you’re talking to will report you”), she wants a place where students can speak freely. She thinks the Telegram group could do this with more gatherings like the one on Friday.
Many Chinese international students told The Tartan that they did not plan to tell their parents that they attended the protest.
Richard, a Carnegie Mellon graduate student from Shangdong, said it wasn’t safe to talk about protests and he didn’t want his parents to worry. Ryan, a Pitt undergraduate from Shanghai, said he never discusses politics with his parents. If he wants to post about “sensitive topics,” he said that Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram are his platforms of choice.
Ryan said that when he lived in China he used U.S. social media platforms like Twitter and YouTube to get news. He just didn’t talk about it unless he is with his closest friends. The CCP heavily censors Chinese media platforms.
Haoxun said that he communicates with his family through WeChat, but after sharing videos of Chinese protesters with them, his account was suspended for 16 days. “My parents always warned me of this,” he told The Tartan. Haoxun made a new account which he is using until he regains access to his old one.
While Haoxun has tried to inform his parents about protests, he said he cannot tell them about his own involvement. He said his cousin attended protests in Chengdu and left his phone in his car to dupe police about his location. Haoxun taught his cousin how to use a VPN and told The Tartan that they only discuss politics using a VPN and Telegram.
Newfound motivation
Hyper-surveillance, strict censorship, travel restraints, historical erasure, unexplained disappearances, and mass incarceration are policies many citizens want to protest, but they are also the policies that keep mass protests off the streets. After three years of harsh pandemic restrictions, some citizens are at a breaking point.
On Nov. 24, a fire killed at least 10 people in a Urumqi apartment building. People speculated that a Covid lockdown made it harder for residents to flee and for rescue services to arrive.
China is maintaining its “zero Covid” policy, enforcing neighborhood-wide lockdowns and mandated stays in quarantine centers for close contacts. Despite these efforts, the country’s case count recently hit record highs.
The “zero Covid” policy has caused food shortages, set back the economy, and exacerbated China’s mental health crisis.
“We were forced to stay in our houses and could not step out,” said Ryan, the student from Shanghai. He remembered government officials dropping off mandated Covid tests multiple times a week.
“In the U.S., it’s just Covid,” Ryan told The Tartan. “In China, you’re in lockdown.” The U.S. reported the highest Covid incidence rate in the world.
Ryan said neighborhoods in China could be “sent away to quarantine hospitals that are built up temporarily. It’s killing people.” He said people seeking other medical care are refused because of Covid restrictions, and it has cost some their lives.
One Carnegie Mellon graduate student said he came to the gathering “in memory of people who died from the pandemic. Not just the virus but the ‘zero Covid’ policy in general.”
Chinese officials eased Covid restrictions this week in response to unprecedented protests.
“I want to support my people,” said Henry, a Chinese international student at Pitt. He said the Friday gathering was his first protest.
Lin, a Carnegie Mellon undergraduate from Shanghai, lived in lockdown for three months this year and heard that government workers entered houses, sanitized furniture, and damaged families’ belongings. She said there were protests in the neighborhood next to hers, but “people aren’t even protesting very aggressively. They’re mild.”
A student speaker said that he didn’t think protesters could demand that Xi Jinping step down, but wanted to “leave a record for history” that Chinese citizens condemn their country’s policies. Another student said he wanted looser pandemic restrictions but did not want government leadership to change and did not believe that the CCP was indoctrinating Uyghurs.
Lin said that she did not know about many CCP abuses — including the severity of Uyghur internment camps — until the recent protests.
The Urumqi fire took place in Xinjiang, an autonomous region in China home to many ethnic minorities, including Uyghur Muslims. Reports say that China began its crackdown on Uyghurs and other ethnic minority groups in 2014.
Uyghurs cannot have passports and risk internment if they are caught with one. The birth rate in the region has plummeted and at least one million Uyghurs have been detained.
The CCP has used what they call “reeducation camps” and what Human Rights Watch calls “detention camps” to orchestrate forced sterilization, systematic rape, and reported genocide.
Yalkun, a research associate at Pitt from Xinjiang, held a sign protesting the internment of Uyghurs, including his family members. Uyghurs who still live in the province risk detainment if they communicate with people abroad. Before cutting communication with him, Yalkun’s niece told him, “You understand, I am going to kick you out of my contacts.” Yalkun told her he understood. They have not spoken in years.
Kalbi, who is married to Yalkun, has two cousins who were detained. The family has not heard from either since their internment two years ago. Kalbi said there was no political reason for them to be detained. The older cousin, 48, was a news reporter. The younger cousin, 38, wrote something when he was in fifth grade that was published in a kids’ journal that was used to justify his internment.
Sal, who attended the protest with the couple, said he has not spoken to his grandmother in five years. She is from Xinjiang and cut communication when the government began its crackdown on Uyghur Muslims. “She could be in a concentration camp,” he told The Tartan.
Growing activism on campus
In November, it took four people until 4:30 a.m. to paint the Fence in protest of China’s “zero Covid” policy. According to the student from Ningbo, who did not paint that Fence but knew about their efforts from the Telegram group, “There weren’t any organized protests in China. It didn’t occur to us that we should gather together.”
Rain streaked the design, obscuring some of the characters. A student misinterpreted the blurred message and painted over part of the design, thinking that it was anti-protests. After realizing that the Fence design supported protests, the student apologized.
Carnegie Mellon has a reputation of being an apolitical campus, which was another barrier to organizing. But some students have been criticizing the CCP all semester, including four Fence designs protesting the government’s brutality.
Aside from “RIP colonialism” following Dr. Uju Anya’s anticolonialism tweet, the most popular Fence designs this semester have been the ones protesting CCP policies.
During his interview with The Tartan, Ryan walked through the reasons why and lengths he’d go to not to return to China. “I have no choice but to be hopeful about these protests,” he said. “I’m not trying to sound like a refugee, but maybe I am.” Friday’s gathering gave him a space to weigh that feeling.
As students left the gathering, one shouted to organizers, “We are not alone, thanks to you.”

Last Wednesday, workers at on-campus La Prima locations held a rally outside Wean Hall to advocate for unionization. La Prima is a coffee company with five locations in Pittsburgh, including two on Carnegie Mellon’s campus. The rally featured speeches from La Prima workers who shared their experiences and why they plan to vote “Yes” on a union. The workers delivered a petition to unionize to their employer on Nov. 1, and a vote is planned for next Wednesday, Dec. 7. If the vote passes, the workers will join Local 1776 of the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW).
A crowd of roughly 50 people, including La Prima workers, members of UFCW Local 1776, and students, gathered on the Mall to listen to these speeches. The first speaker was a worker at Coffee Tree Roasters, another local coffee company that recently unionized. He spoke about the issues they faced when forming a union and about the importance of their efforts. “While all of our campaigns are different, at the very core of them is our fight to keep our humanity as workers. How many of us here have had to go through the dehumanizing experience of choosing our health over paying rent? How many of us have been harassed at work and been offered no support and sympathy?”
The next speaker was Kit, who had worked at several of La Prima’s locations in their years with the company. They spoke about how working at multiple locations allowed them to observe a pattern. They experienced harassment from customers and their manager, and when they brought up these issues to management, their experiences were dismissed. The harassment included rude and misogynistic comments, and even a customer who attempted to rip off their mask. They also noted that this treatment made them reluctant to be open about the fact that they were a member of the LGBTQ community.
The third speaker was Nico, who shared his experience attempting to bring up the issue of healthcare coverage with their employer. He said that after reaching out via email, the company scheduled a meeting with a healthcare representative from Aflac on Sunday. However, when he showed up to this meeting, the promised representative was not there. After repeatedly reaching out, he had to learn not from Sam Patti, the owner, but from other employees, that they were not considering healthcare coverage because “not enough people want it.” The crowd found this laughable.
Lastly, attendees heard from Cecilia, who discussed the issue of wages. She spoke about the stress of trying to make ends while working for marginally above minimum wage, and the precarious nature of her income being little more than a “cost-benefit analysis” by her employer. She also shared an anecdote in which Patti scolded her for rinsing the steamed milk pitcher between uses because doing so might waste milk. To be clear, failing to rinse the milk pitcher is a violation of health codes.
Several of the speeches told common stories. They allege that earlier this week, Patti showed up, unannounced, at the La Prima location in Gates Hall, where he stood silently observing the workers for no clear reason — the workers agreed this was an intimidation tactic. Several also spoke about a letter they had received earlier that week, urging them not to vote for a union on the grounds that introducing a “third party” into the employee-management relationship was unnecessary. It was agreed that this letter comes thanks to the anti-union law firm their employer had hired.
The rally included rousing call-and-response chants, an appearance from the Secretary of the Treasury for the Pennsylvania Chapter of the AFL-CIO, and a performance of “Sit Down” — a protest song about the 1936 General Motors Strike. Across the speeches, several repeated the following sentiment: “United we bargain, divided we beg.”

After months of protests that started with the death of Mahsa Amini in September, an Iranian official has reported the morality policy has been abolished. Amini died in September after she was detained by Iran’s morality police for supposedly violating the country’s dress laws. Her death sparked months of protests in the country.
During a Saturday meeting, Iran's Attorney General Mohammad Javad Montazeri said the morality police “was abolished by the same authorities who installed it.” Iranian state media have strongly pushed back against Montazeri’s remarks, stating the Interior Ministry oversees the force, not the judiciary. As of Sunday, Dec. 4, there has been no confirmation from the Interior Ministry.
Since protests have begun, hundreds of people have been killed in the unrest. Iranian officials have continued to state that Tehran would not change the Islamic Republic’s mandatory hijab policy. In the past few weeks, calls for strike action and mass mobilization have resulted in an escalation of unrest within Iran. 
According to Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), a total of 471 protesters have been killed since Sept. 17. This number includes 64 minors. They also state 61 regime forces have been killed and 18,210 individuals have been arrested, with only 3,546 being identified. 
A top state security body in Iran disagrees with HRANA’s estimate, saying that 200 people, including members of security forces, have lost their lives. The United Nations has disagreed with this figure, stating that the anti-government protests have cost more than 300 lives. 
Despite the widespread protests going on the past few months, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on Saturday, Dec. 3, hailed Iran’s Islamic Republic as a guarantor of rights and freedoms. “Iran has the most progressive constitution in the world,” Raisi said in his speech. He said this is because the constitution marries “ideals with democracy.”
Additionally, Iranian state media on Sunday, Dec. 4 stated that four individuals were executed and three were given prison sentences between five and 10 years for acting against national security. Those executed were charged with “the crime of cooperating with the intelligence services of the Zionist regime and for kidnapping.” They were convicted of cooperating with Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad, and thus executed. Iran’s state media claimed that this group of individuals were behind the kidnapping and interrogation of Iranaian national Mansour Rasouli.

This Thursday, the Undergraduate Student Senate hosted a town hall meeting to discuss the recently proposed change to the structure of Student Government: removing the positions of Student Body President (SBP) and Student Body Vice President (SBVP).
The plan was brought forth by the Third Student Government Restructure Committee, which consisted of members of both the Student Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA). The proposed changes include dissolving the Office of SBP and SBVP, which would consist of transferring any remaining responsibilities to the “Co-presidents of Student Government'' (i.e. the Senate Chair and GSA President), and restructuring leadership roles to dissolve the Executive Branch and make the VP of Finance and VP of Organizations instead independent director positions. Such a restructuring would also include changes to Student Government executive offices, which would now consist of Co-Presidents and one member of Undergraduate Student Senate and GSA Exec each.  
Other changes included in the bill include adjusting all other bylaws for compliance with the previous changes, as well as general revisions for obsolete Constitutional language that hasn’t been updated in the wake of university updates and other bylaw changes. 
The reasoning presented by the Restructure Committee echoes their previous Tartan Op-Ed. This included the characterization of the role of SBP and SBVP as a largely ceremonial role that doesn’t have many individual responsibilities unique to the position, nor is the role essential to enforcement of bylaws (unlike the U.S. government, the Senate has their own enforcement powers and does not need to rely on the executive branch). They also note that such a role is perceptually intended to represent the entire student body, which is an unrealistic expectation to ask of a single person when it comes to the vastly different lived experiences of undergraduate and graduate students. They also note that the position also causes a perceptual divide between the student body and student government, as the student body looks to the SBP and SBVP as the campus leader, but the real power to make decisions and changes on behalf of the student body lies in the Senate. 
This isn’t the first time changes have been made to the overall structure of Carnegie Mellon Student Government. The most recent previous changes have occurred in 2020 and 2022, in two separate initiatives that also included restructuring the executive branch positions and responsibilities, among other things like fiscal policy changes.   
Following the initial presentation on the reforms, there was a period of questioning and discussion. 
During this time, there were a couple of clarifications regarding the structure of Student Government should these reforms be implemented. If these reforms are passed and the role SBP and SBVP are dissolved, then the only positions that are elected by the student body will be the newly-renamed Director of Finance and Director of Organizations. The election process for the Senate Chair (which would then be titled Senate President) and GSA President would remain the same. For Senate President, this would mean that the Senate would elect a Senator to be named the Senate President in a round of internal elections — a system that mirrors the Parliamentary systems of countries like the United Kingdom.
Beyond these clarifications, many students raised discussion points in favor of reforms. Among these arguments were points not previously mentioned in the bylaw presentation about having easier transitions into the role and the fact that this is simply the next step on current trends. When it comes to transitioning into the role of Senate Chair and GSA President, proponents of these reforms note that existing senators already have the best knowledge of the process of how Student Government works, and would be the best prepared to interface with administration. To them, this is where the most efficiency gains can be seen, and the streamlined process will help with administrative discussions. The speakers who spoke to the history of changes within Student Senate noted that this was simply the next step in a process that has been a conversation for the past 10 years, with at least four years of tangible bylaw changes that have been transitioning powers towards this sort of system already. They argue that such changes have been effective thus far, and that the most impactful decision was actually whether to transition power from SBP and SBVP to the Student Senate and GSA, which already occurred — they view this current proposal as restructuring to match this current power distribution. 
Many students also raised discussion points against reforms. Among these speakers, common threads included worries over rushing the process and decreasing the diversity of leadership. When it came to worries over rushing the process, those against the reforms noted that this process seems largely unfinished, with unclear guidelines for impeachment of the president in this new system, gaps in explanations on how this transition would occur and what efficiency would be gained, and questions over whether the solution to having unclear powers for the president should be to remove the position instead of just clarifying roles. Such speakers wanted a longer process that would reconsider keeping some elements of general elections, or potentially put this decision to a student referendum to decide instead of allowing it to simply be a vote by the Student Senate. The speakers who questioned the diversity of the Senate after these reforms spoke of worries that the Senate would turn into a “boys club” where power was consolidated in a group of people who are fairly unknown to the general student body. They believe that the perceptual or efficiency gains should not come at the expense of representation, and that the perceptual gains of seeing elected students in the SBP and SBVP roles that look like them, regardless of whether they are a figurehead, is a powerful thing. 
Discussion lasted the entire meeting and consisted of many back-and-forth conversations between proponents and opponents of these reforms. However, no decisions were made in the past meeting — this was the discussion meeting prior to the vote. 
More context on the Student Government Executive Committee’s views can be found in last week’s Tartan Op-Ed. The current timeline has the Undergraduate Student Senate voting on the plan in January following winter break.

In April, the Pittsburgh City Council voted to ban single-use plastic bags by retail businesses at checkout or delivery. This legislation will go into effect one year from the day of the 9-0 vote, April 14, 2023. Under the legislation, “retailers will be able to provide a consumer with a recycled paper bag for a fee of no less than 10 cents; the fee will be fully recouped by the retailer.” This fee will not apply to those who use an EBT transfer card or those who are a part of the Women, Infants, and Children program. 
The legislation also requires businesses to post information in their stores in advance of these changes. Beginning 90 days after April 14, 2023 and for six months after, affected locations must post signage advertising this change. 
The Carnegie Mellon Bookstore is one of those locations. A sign outside the bookstore advertises the upcoming changes. They will be prohibited from providing plastic bags and non-recycled paper bags, they may not charge less than 10 cents per recycled paper bag provided, and the charge for the bag must be on the receipt as “carry-out bag charge.”
A pilot of a reusable bag program is also outlined in the legislation. No later than 90 days after the legislation is enacted, a pilot reusable bag program that will allow for purchase, donation, and distribution of reusable bags by individuals and organizations will be established. 
While this legislation was passed in April 2022, the original proposal was introduced in November 2021 by Councilperson Erika Strassburger and was held for several months to clarify details related to equity and implementation. 
"This landmark piece of legislation will sharply curtail litter, mitigate stormwater risk, reduce the amount of microplastics in our soil and water, improve the City’s recycling efficacy, and begin to break our dependence on fossil fuel-based products,” Strassburger said of the ban.
Every year, Americans use approximately 100 billion plastic bags — requiring 12 million barrels of oil to manufacture. These single-use plastic pages contribute to litter in communities, collect in waterways, and clog storm drains. Additionally, single-use plastic bags obstruct the City’s recycling machines and take 500 years to decompose in a landfill. 
A report from PennEnvironment Research and Policy Center in 2021 sampled 50 of Pennsylvania’s “most iconic rivers, lakes, and streams.” They found microplastics in 100 percent of their samples. 94.3 percent of those sites sampled had microfilm, which comes from bags and flexible plastic packaging. 
The text of the legislation reveals some of the littering problems in Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh. From the 2018-2019 Pennsylvania Litter Research Study, there are an estimated 502 million pieces of litter on Pennsylvania’s roads, with most common items being cigarette butts and plastics. There is an estimated 2,000 pieces of litter per mile in Pittsburgh alone. 
The text also states that the ban on single-use plastic bags has the potential to eliminate more than 108 million plastic bags from Pittsburgh’s waste stream every year. This action also is a result of the city’s Climate Action Plan 3.0, which has a goal of Zero Waste. This means a 100 percent diversion of waste from landfills and modernizing waste collection systems.

Though the 2022 midterm elections were just last month, talks of the 2024 presidential election have begun. On Nov. 15, former President Donald Trump announced his intent to run in the upcoming election. 
“In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,” Trump said in his announcement. This was greeted with cheers and applause from those gathered in the room (including advisers and conservative influencers) at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida estate. 
The announcement of Trump’s candidacy came not long after he filed with the Federal Election Commission. Trump’s website has also been updated with a page for his 2024 campaign, but users must enter an email to view the page.
While Trump is the first Republican to announce his candidacy, former Vice President Mike Pence is expected to announce his candidacy as well.
Florida governor Ron DeSantis may also make a run for the 2024 Republican primary. However, given the current “resign-to-run” law in Florida, DeSantis would have to resign from his position as Florida governor if he runs for federal office. However, there is talk in Florida’s state legislature to review its “resign-to-run” law. 
While President Joe Biden has not announced his candidacy for the 2024 Democrat presidential nomination, he has voiced his intent to run. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.), a close ally of President Biden, indicated that he expects a candidacy announcement in 2023.
There will also be some differences in the 2024 Democratic Party’s primary elections. Since 1972, Iowa has been the first state to vote on presidential candidates. However, Democratic National Committee (DNC) leaders voted this past week to make South Carolina instead have the first primary election for Democrats in 2024. Three days later, Georgia and Michigan will hold their primaries. In his letter to DNC leaders, President Biden wrote that states that hold the first presidential primaries need to reflect the “overall diversity of our party and our nation — economically, geographically, demographically.” 
This may be a reflection of President Biden’s primary results as well. In 2020, Biden finished fourth in Iowa, fifth in New Hampshire, second in Nevada, but first in South Carolina. In 2020, those were the first four states to hold primaries, in that order.
This decision isn’t complete yet. The proposal needs approval from a full DNC meeting, which will take place in early 2023. States will then have to schedule their primaries on the agreed-upon date or their results may be discarded. President Biden suggested that this ordering would only apply to 2024 and the order should be revisited each presidential election cycle.
If Biden’s recommendation passes, it will break with the Republican primary calendar. The Republican National Committee voted this year to have its usual lineup of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina as its first caucuses and primaries.

At the close of each year, The Tartan reassesses the year’s events. Thistles go to people and events that had a positive effect on the campus community and society at large; thorns go to those that have negatively impacted the campus and our society.
A thistle to Carnegie Mellon for increasing the wages of student workers. For how expensive this university is, there is no reason why students should be working for below a living wage.
A thorn to the Craig St. Chipotle for never having food (especially chips). It’s frustrating when orders are incomplete due to some level of incompetence. We understand working in food service can be difficult, but it’s hard to justify always being out of food.
A thistle to Paul Dano’s Riddler in “The Batman.” Some members of the staff may like you more than others, but without a doubt, your performance stood out in an excellent movie.
A thorn to Ron Desantis for being the Governor of Florida. The “Don’t Say Gay” bill is a major step-back in the fight for equal rights. How are people supposed to learn from history if it’s not being taught?
A thistle to “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,” and to Daniel Craig and Rian Johnson both agreeing that they’d like to continue working together on Benoit Blanc stories. Much of the Tartan staff greatly enjoyed your movie, and we look forward to seeing what comes next.
A thorn to Amazon for not being able to ship holiday gifts before break. Sometimes last-minute gifts are a must, while other times we have to wait unnecessarily long for a simple gift for a friend. The inconsistency hurts.
A thistle to the Spotify graphic design team for the incredible Wrapped layouts and design. Year after year, we anticipate seeing what we spent the last year listening to, and your work always brings smiles to our faces.
A thorn to everything becoming a subscription model. Why can’t we just make a one-time purchase of something and own it? We don’t want to have to continually pay for something we might rarely use.
A thistle to TAs in office hours carrying classes, filling in for gaps in content and alleviating students from the misery of answering poorly worded questions. Without you, students would be much worse off.
A thorn to 70-degree weather in November. Though the warm weather is appreciated, it’s a sign of a larger problem: global warming. We hope we are not one of the last generations that gets to live in a comfortable climate.
A thistle to Craig St. Starbucks unionizing! Unionizing is an important part of workers’ rights. Unions are fundamentally needed and a great demonstration of democracy in the workplace.
A thorn to finals being on a Sunday. Sunday is supposed to be a day off for students to relax and study if needed. Who thought it was a good idea to make it an exam day?
A thistle to Scotch’n’Soda’s production of “Something Rotten.” Without question, Scotch’n’Soda has put on another great show that many members of our staff enjoyed watching. From the props and costumes to the actors and musicians, everyone and everything involved was fantastic.
A thorn to Ye and those who still support him. Enough with the antisemitism and racism.
A thistle to the My Chemical Romance reunion tour. Many members of our staff enjoy your work and it was great to see them in-person and releasing new music.
A thorn to Vladimir Putin. Your invasion of Ukraine is completely unjustified and has resulted in senseless violence and loss of life. Your presidency is filled with corruption and human rights violations; you are nothing short of a war criminal.
A thistle to Lou Reed, and everything he’s done. His music is often truly exceptional, and he’s done so much to promote the idea of the “cool Jew” into public consciousness.
A thorn to the U.S. Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade. Bodily autonomy — including choosing abortion —  is a fundamental right.
A thistle to having a real fall break. It was much needed and members of our staff were very relieved to have a break in the middle of the semester. There’s no denying being a student is a lot of work, and fall break helped alleviate some of that stress.
A thorn to the 112 staff for making students feel panicky about a class they don’t really care about.
A thistle to South Korea and Japan in the World Cup. South Korea beat Portugal and Japan beat Germany and Spain, both securing a place in the knockout stages of the tournament. Fans can look forward to potential deep runs towards the quarters, semis, and perhaps even finals.
A thorn to Qatar for using slave labor for the completion of World Cup stadiums. Soccer is a unifying game, but its enjoyment should never come at the cost of human lives.
A thistle to protesters everywhere who are fighting for change. In Iran and China, protesters are risking their lives to fight for what they believe in: freedom for the government. We honor all those who have lost their lives in their struggles and hope for quick change.

When I went home for Thanksgiving Break, I, like many college students, hung out with my hometown friends. On one of these outings, a friend and I took a trip to our local mall. While I knew it had been on the decline for a few years, I didn’t expect it to be as bad as it truly was. 
The Beaver Valley Mall used to be a much more popular location. Once upon a time, Sears was one of its anchor stores. It also had an American Eagle, a Hot Topic, and both a Piercing Pagoda and a Piercing Pagoda Too! Like many, the Sears shut down after their 2018 bankruptcy. Many retailers in the mall have since left, and now there’s only one Piercing Pagoda. 
To me, It looked like we had entered the age that I would call “The Death of the American Mall.” The COVID-19 pandemic killed many already failing malls. With little to no customers, what reason did many of these retailers have to continue paying rent? As more and more stores left malls, fewer people had a reason to go to the mall, thus the remaining stores would have reduced customers, etc. It’s a self-perpetuating cycle that starts when mall managers can no longer lease spaces. 
But the pandemic wasn’t the start of this decline — it was only the nail in the coffin for many. Many big-name retailers appeared in the news because they were shutting down their stores. Sears, Macy’s, and JCPenny, for example, are some of the ones I recognize. I no longer see news of store openings for these staple department stores, only closures. The saddest part: malls were and continue to be a staple of suburban communities.
As these stores closed, consumers would have to travel further to get the same commodities. The distance isn't too much further though — a report from 2017 estimates only a three to six mile travel to the next mall. 
Personally, I don’t want malls to go away. While I greatly appreciate the convenience of online shopping, it doesn’t fill the gap of the experience of just going out to the mall with friends or family and walking around and glancing into the various stores. It’s convenient to have so many unique retail options in such a space, not to mention the food options. There’s something about physical shopping that makes me much more willing to purchase something I may not need than online shopping, and I sort of like that.
The slow decay of my local mall has made me assume that malls across America are dying. But, fortunately, it doesn’t seem like that is the case. A study conducted in June 2021 found that five percent more people were shopping at physical malls than prior to the pandemic. So why do I still feel like American malls are dying?
I think, for me, it’s because I’ve changed my habits. The mall I went to so much when I was younger is dying, which makes me generalize that to the entirety of the mall system. Additionally, I go to the mall for different reasons. Before, it was almost expressly to go shopping with my family. The mall was never really a “social” place for me; it was where I went to lunch when I was on school field trips or when my mom decided I needed some new clothes. Now, the mall is just one of many means I have to purchase clothes and other goods; I go much less frequently, and I have much less of a “need” to go. 
Some of my recent experiences also point to the fact that malls are far from dying. I went to the Ross Park Mall on Black Friday with some of my family, and it was very difficult to find parking. Some of the stores even had lines coming out of them, which I was not expecting. I may have outgrown my need for malls, but I don’t think the average consumer has. While my personal experience may have decided that American malls are dying, it’s looking like they’ll be around for at least another decade.

Dear Tartans,
As a Chinese student, I am writing to you about the ongoing disaster and protests happening in the People’s Republic of China, caused by the so-called “zero Covid” policy.
If you have not followed recent news from China, let me introduce some background. Contrary to all other countries in the world, China has maintained its hardcore “zero Covid” policy even after the Omicron variant dominated case numbers.
It is not surprising that the extremely high infectiousness of the Omicron variant has made this policy extraordinarily difficult; the “zero Covid” lockdowns have caused a number of tragedies that are hard to even read about. 27 people in Guizhou died in a car accident when being unnecessarily sent to quarantine; a three-year-old died because first-aid didn’t arrive in time; and a fire in Urumqi killed 10 because firefighters weren’t able to approach the building.
The inconvenience and economic loss caused by such lockdown are even more massive. Across the country, markets are closed, businesses are down, workers and young people have lost their jobs, and small businesses and ordinary families are under unprecedented pressure.
Therefore, in recent days we have seen some really extraordinary scenes. The Chinese people are protesting against their government with a courage that has not been seen in a generation. City after city, university after university, residents and students are gathering in protest against the lockdown and demanding political reform, even calling on the President to resign.
Such protests are extremely rare and risky in an authoritarian China. However, it sends a clear message to the world that even under the most brutal regime, we, the Chinese people, still long for democracy and human rights. So today, I ask you to please notice and support our brave citizens, who are fighting for a brighter future for our country. It is exactly their courage that roused my responsibility and made me feel obligated to say this today.
Thank you!
A Chinese student and citizen

As a chess player, I’m grateful for any attention brought to the game, especially in pop culture. There is something special about chess, in terms of the almost inherent respect most people have for it. In that respect is a channelable fascination, which shows like “The Queen’s Gambit” took advantage of two years ago, bringing countless new players to the game. Almost in tandem, several chess streamers skyrocketed in popularity, such as BotezLive and GMHikaru (Hikaru Nakamura is first and foremost a professional chess player, but his stream has blown up in the last couple years). While I have my ups and downs with the way chess is becoming more mainstream, the recent scandal involving Grandmaster Hans Niemann really pushed me over the line.
It shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that to make something more popular, it often has to be sexualized. In the case of “The Queen’s Gambit,” Beth Harmon is a prime example of this. By virtue of being an attractive, sexually active woman, her character and story become more interesting to your average person than if she were less attractive, or even not a woman. This in itself isn’t surprising, as other shows like “Game of Thrones” do the exact same thing with Daenerys Targaryen, using sexuality as a sort of entry point for casual, perhaps otherwise uninterested viewers.
Two summers ago, I was lucky enough to meet Alexandra and Andrea Botez while they were playing chess in Union Square. They told me about their frustration with this sort of thing, especially with how prevalent sexualization is on Twitch. Many viewers go so far as to say that their skill in chess could partially be chocked up to their “distracting attractiveness.” Their response was to have Andrea play games wearing traditionally male, non-revealing clothing, to “test” if that was really the case. Even just as a chess fan, I find it disappointing that this needs to be demonstrated. It’s disappointing how an “entry point” to chess can come to characterize a person’s interest in it.
The Hans Niemann story, oddly enough, is not totally separate from this. It points to a deeper, more frustrating reality in the chess world.
As a brief recap, Niemann was accused of cheating by world champion Magnus Carlsen. The ensuing investigation sprouted countless theories explaining how Niemann could have cheated. While there were some interesting theories produced, the one that gained the most traction suggested that Niemann used anal beads, to receive vibratory signals telling him what moves to play. This is obviously funny, but I’m more interested in why it’s funny.
Humor almost always comes from a subversion of expectations. A good punchline, for example, is always an unexpected one. It’s why kids are typically so unfunny; their humor is highly predictable. Take, then, Hans Niemann. He’s a professional chess player, and not particularly attractive, so conventional expectations tell us that he’s awkward, antisocial, boring. This can clearly be subverted by association with anal beads, something “out there,” that you would never imagine someone like him using. It’s funny because it’s so outrageous. Now, however, the truth of the matter is a little clearer. The average person didn’t care so much about the cheating — the anal beads, however, were hilarious.
Over the last few years, chess has skyrocketed in popularity. With that, one would expect that the popular perception of chess players would change, but I’m convinced that it hasn’t. The stereotype of chess players (primarily professionals) being antisocial, boring, serious people has not gone anywhere. It has only been subverted, by Beth Harmon, by the Botez sisters, by Niemann’s beads. Even Hikaru Nakamura’s stream has picked up a larger following for similar reasons — he subverts your expectations by having a personality, by being passionate and exciting. Yet, these examples are not seen redefining the rule, they are exceptions to it.
I don’t know what the remedy for this is, or if one exists at all. Our society is one that deals in stereotypes. When anyone gets ahead, they don’t change the status quo; they are only “not like the others.” Beth Harmon, the Botez sisters — they are “not like other girls.” They aren’t like other chess players. This attitude, this rhetoric, is so deeply rooted in our social fabric that modernizing it seems impossible.
I think the best solution is patience. Over enough time these “exceptions” to the rule stop being novelties, they become the expectation. In that way the “hot chess player” or the “cool chess player” would cease to exist. A similar cycle has already taken place with superhero movies, where humor was used to subvert the expectation of superheroes being serious, intense people. However, over the last 10-15 years, humor has become the standard among superheroes, so people are turning to “edgier” takes, like 2022’s “The Batman.” That’s all to say, it might take a decade or two for the popular perception of chess players to really change. While I wish there were a quicker solution, it’s better than nothing. Until then, people will slowly come around — I mean, the chess speaks for itself.

On Nov. 28, Merriam-Webster announced “gaslighting” as the 2022 Word of the Year. The dictionary defines gaslighting as “the act or practice of grossly misleading someone especially for one’s own advantage” and the word had a 1,740 percent increase in lookups this year. 
The word originates from a 1938 play called “Gas Light.” In the story, a man tries to make his wife believe she is going insane, and his attempt includes activities in the attic which cause their house’s gas lights to dim. While the house’s lights do in fact dim, the man insists the lights are not dimming, and that his wife’s own perceptions are wrong.
However, most people (including myself) recognize gaslighting from the ever-popular mantra: gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss. This mantra — which was originally a caricature of the phrase “live, laugh, love” — spread on Tumblr with many people connecting instances of gaslighting, gatekeeping, and girlbossing in media like “Gone Girl.” Although, lately, some of its most ironic usage refers to when people, often women, seek to do something cool or just out of pocket.
But, gaslighting is much more somber than that. As author Judi Ketteler describes, “Today, gaslighting can mean everything from being dismissive of someone’s feelings and experiences to conducting a large-scale psychological manipulation that makes people question what they know to be true.”
When I heard Merriam-Webster’s announcement, I was, at first, enraptured in the comedy of a pop-culture, satirical phrase being proclaimed the word of the year. However, as the idea settled with me, I was overcome with a kind of sadness. Today, many of us are surrounded by disillusionment with crises being exposed everyday, coming to grips with the ever-looming destruction of the planet, and rampant misinformation online. Gaslighting is unfortunately not just a funny meme term, but rather ingrained into how information is disseminated today.
Gaslighting is actually a tool often used by abusers, some more malicious political efforts, corporations who seek to mislead the public, and healthcare professionals who overlook symptoms as exaggerated or irrational — to name a few. It is especially pervasive online where misinformation and abused comment sections often mesh in such a way that psychologically manipulates viewers. The fact that gaslighting was among the most searched words of 2022 speaks volumes of where we are today. 
However, the good news is that as people become more aware of what gaslighting is, they can identify it. This hopefully means people advocate for what they know to be true and are able to think more critically about the information they receive and the discussions they have. 
Our words say so much about us, and while gaslighting can be ironic, it is also a deeply destructive tool. But, maybe as we go into 2023 with an understanding of the word, we will be able to trust our senses and intuition in a way that makes our world a slightly more bearable place to live.

If you spend any time on BookTok, or decided to read the many, many, many, many “best books of 2022” roundups (see: The New York Times, The Guardian, Time Magazine, Esquire, NPR), you may have been intrigued or excited to see what people had to say about books of the year. Or, if you’re anything like me and have an overflowing TBR (To Be Read) list, you were incredibly overwhelmed. This is my dilemma: there are just so many books. 
On the one hand, this is a really good thing! People have interesting things to say, and others have comments about those things. It encourages discussion and new thoughts about the world around us. On the other hand, it is almost impossible to read everything you want to read. At this point, I’m surprised my Goodreads hasn’t crashed from me frantically clicking “want to read” 20 times with every best books list I come across.
These lists are fun when you’re looking for gifts for someone or just perusing for a new read. But, with every recommendation, my “to-do list” of books gets longer and longer, and it can take the fun out of just walking into a bookstore or library and picking something out of my own volition. Because, at least for me, it feels wrong to start reading a whole different book when I have fifty other books waiting on my TBR.
Additionally, my other issue with “best” book lists is the many exceptional books that aren’t included because even the people who write these lists couldn’t possibly read every book that comes out that year, some are bound to be left in the dust. There are inevitably books that are great, but just not published by a major company and not advertised as heavily as others.
However, these lists can be super helpful and interesting to read, particularly when you see a book you loved getting featured. It is such a warm and fuzzy feeling to know that others loved the same book you loved.
So, yeah, on the whole, I don’t want these book round-up lists to stop, I’m just expressing my urge to read way more books than I conceivably have time for. But, I am super grateful we live in world where books are not simply words on a page but ways to reflect and connect with one another. There is something sweet and kind of intimate about sharing book favorites with others or gifting someone a book they end up loving. Thus, while these book lists can make me feel overwhelmed, overall, they are a fun, warm addition to the book world.

This past week, I’ve been sinking some of my freetime into beating “Pokémon Violet,” one of the latest entries in the franchise. I have to say that I have greatly enjoyed the game despite its flaws. It has some serious performance and graphics issues and was arguably unfinished at its time of release. This is just one of many instances of companies releasing an unfinished game to consumers.
“Pokémon Scarlet” and “Pokémon Violet” are two games on an ever-growing list of games that have been released "unfinished." Other honorable mentions on this list include “Cyberpunk 2077,” “No Man’s Sky,” and recent PC release of “The Callisto Protocol.” A positive thing is that all of these games are modern releases, meaning they can be patched after launch. But that’s exactly the problem: that means companies can release incomplete games that can be “fixed” later via patches.
I think one of the most famous sayings in the video game world comes from Nintendo game director Shigeru Miyamoto: “A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.” While this may have been true before the era of patches, I don’t think it really holds true anymore. Just look at “No Man’s Sky.” The game had a lackluster launch that didn’t meet fans’ expectations. Several years of free updates later, the game is hardly recognizable — it has been improved immensly. A rushed game might not be bad forever, but it is certainly nothing to strive for.  
As long as fans continue to purchase these incomplete games, companies will continue to release them and then (hopefully) fix them later. The only people losing here are the fans who continue to pay $60 or more for the mess that these developers are putting out. 
The “Pokémon” franchise is a fantastic example of fan loyalty turning a franchise into a complete mess. For me, “Pokémon X” and “Pokémon Y” were the last mainline games that felt any semblance of “complete” at launch (and even then, some aspects of the game were lacking). But generation after generation, people continue to buy the titles at launch (myself included). This gives Game Freak no incentive to have a complete, polished product on launch day because people will buy it regardless of its state.
I fully acknowledge that I am part of the problem. Nothing is going to change until consumers force companies to change these practices. Sooner or later, brand loyalty is going to run out (I hope) and Game Freak and these other companies are going to have to realize that current practices are unsustainable. Hopefully. they’ll realize more time and resources need to be spent on these games before they release.
This isn’t to say that patches and updates post-launch are bad. Patches and updates show dedication to games — that developers are willing to listen to the fans, iron out any bugs that were in the original game, and add new content. “Terraria” is a great example of this. The game’s sixth “final” update is set to launch in 2023. The game was good to begin with, and each subsequent update has made it even better. The developers behind the game love their work and their fans, and the development of “Terraria” is an exemplar of what good developer support looks like.
But in the end, it is entirely up to the consumer what is acceptable. Despite knowing that “Pokémon Violet” has flaws and could be a better game, I have still been enjoying it. It has one of the best stories in the series, and I’m really enjoying the open-world. Nonetheless, I acknowledge that not the best Game Freak has to offer, and in the future, I plan on waiting for a game to be deemed “finished” before I purchase it.
