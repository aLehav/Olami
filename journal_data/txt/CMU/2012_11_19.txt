The men’s basketball team participated in the Al Van Wie/Rotary Classic at the College of Wooster on Friday and Saturday. The Tartans played a game on each day, battling the Wooster Fighting Scots on Friday and the Otterbein University Cardinals on Saturday.
The 13th-ranked Fighting Scots proved to a challenging opposition to open regular season play for the Tartans, as the Carnegie Mellon team fell 79–67. 
Junior Asad Meghani led the way for the Tartans with his great shooting, scoring 20 points on five of nine shooting from three-point land. Junior guard Rashaun Riley added 11 points on five of nine shooting.
Meghani also tied with the most assists on the night for the Tartans with three, along with junior forward Rob Mohen.
After an abysmal first half, where the Tartans shot just 27.6 percent from the floor, the second half proved to be much better. The Tartans played the Fighting Scots almost even, losing the second half by only four points. But after the cold first half, the Tartans could not get out of the hole they had dug for themselves.
The Fighting Scots shot a blistering 58.2 percent and scored 50 points in the paint, besting the Tartans’ 18 points in the paint.
On Saturday, the Tartans played Otterbein, losing this game 75–58.
Senior guard Andre Moore scored a career-high 22 points on nine of 14 shooting, four of six from three.
Moore filled up the stat sheet, grabbing six rebounds and doling out three assists. Even his defense was on point, racking up four steals on the night.
The only other Tartan who scored in double figures was junior forward Sean Brophy, who had 11 points on three of six shooting.
Yet again, the efficient shooting of the Tartan’s opponent made victory nearly impossible to attain. The Cardinals shot 57.4 percent from the field and 42.9 percent from three, while the Tartan’s field goal percentage was just 37.5.
“This weekend didn’t turn out how we expected, but we’re going to bounce back,” Moore said. “I’m extremely confident in our team, and I feel like we have the potential for a promising season. We have all the pieces, we just have to put them together.”

The women’s basketball team opened its season with the DoubleTree Classic, hosted by Carnegie Mellon. The Tartans opened the season against Wesley College and played their second game against Otterbein University, splitting the two games.
In the first game, Carnegie Mellon took on the Wesley College Wolverines and coasted to an 80–43 victory. Senior forward Emily Peel led the way with 20 points, making six out of nine shots. Off the bench, sophomore forward Gabrielle West poured in 18 points on seven of 13 shooting.
First-year forward Liza Otto played a well-rounded game, going six for six in the first half, and dished out five assists in the game. Otto also pulled down eight rebounds.
First-year guard Lindsay Poss led the Tartans’ dominant rebounding with 11 boards. The Tartans won the rebounding battle 58–33.
“It was great to start the season off with a win,” Peel said. “We really controlled the tempo and the boards against Wesley.”
In Saturday’s game, the second of the DoubleTree Classic for Carnegie Mellon, the Tartans faced the Otterbein University Cardinals, falling in the close game 59–54.
West and Peel led the way again for the Tartans in this close game. West scored 18 points on six of 18 shooting and Peel recorded a double-double, pulling down 13 rebounds and scoring 10 points.
The ball did not move as fluidly on offense in this game as it did in Friday’s game. The Tartans only recorded six assists as a team against the Cardinals, versus 21 against the Wolverines.
The lack of ball movement led to fewer open shots, as the Tartans shot just 38 percent from the field and 28.6 percent from three. In the victory the day before, the Tartans shot 47.7 percent from the field and a scorching 42.9 percent from three-point territory.
“I think it was great to have such a competitive game at the beginning of the year, because our entire team knows the level we have to compete at,” Peel said.
The Tartans’ next game is against Grove City College at home on Tuesday. Tipoff is at 6 p.m.

The No. 17-ranked women’s soccer team continued to charge its way through the NCAA tournament draw, until facing a tight loss on Sunday against Emory University.
On Saturday, the Tartans took the field against No. 25 Wheaton College of Massachusetts and emerged victorious, 3–0.
“We scored against Wheaton and never let up. It was all about our mentality and will to win,” senior midfielder Stephanie Hare said. “Now the focus is on Emory and keeping our national championship dreams alive.”
It was a sunny 53° F when the Tartans played against the Wheaton College Lyons. The Tartans gained control of the ball early in the game, and set the tone with their first goal from junior forward Alex Venegas within the first five minutes. The Tartans continued to pressure the Wheaton defense, keeping the ball in the Lyons’ end of the field.
Thirteen minutes later, Venegas scored again by kicking the ball out of the Lyons goalie’s reach. Carnegie Mellon had 11 shots on goal in the first half.
In the second half, the game became tighter, and the Lyons played better defense. In this half, the Tartans only had five shots on goal.
The Tartans defense remained strong throughout, only allowing the Lyons five shots on goal the entire game. With help from the Tartan defense, junior goalkeeper Anna Albi recorded her sixth straight shut out.
Junior defender Rachel Contopoulos scored her first goal of the season in the second half of the game, increasing the Tartans lead to 3–0.
“It’s another great day to be a Tartan,” sophomore defender Lauren Simicich said.
However, the team fell in the quarterfinal round of the NCAAs the following day. The Tartans took on No. 16 ranked Emory University Eagles at home with 302 fans cheering them on.
The Tartans have a lot of experience against the Eagles from University Athletic Association play. But despite all the matchup experience, the two teams could not score.
Yesterday in NCAA play, the Tartans and the Eagles stood deadlocked at 0–0 through two overtimes and well into the shootout.
The Eagles finally pulled through, winning 11–10 in the shootout. Emory will play in the semifinal round against Wheaton College of Illinois.

Although a panda isn’t usually known as an aquatic animal, sophomore Cole Um, previously nicknamed “Panda” by the Carnegie Mellon swim team, has contributed greatly to the Tartans’ recent swimming success.
Originally from Federal Way, Wash., Um has been one of Carnegie Mellon’s top swimmers this season, placing first in the 100-yard breaststroke to propel the Tartans to victory against Grove City College.
This past weekend, Um placed second in the 100-yard breaststroke to place second overall, helping the Tartans win three individual dual meets during the annual home quad meet against Allegheny College, University of Rochester, and Washington & Lee University.
“The depth of our team has improved,” Um said. “Last year was a struggle, but now I feel that in every event we’ve been pretty dominant.”
Um had a decent start to his swimming career last year: He qualified for the University Athletic Association Conference championship, where he placed in the top 20 in several of his signature events. Still, he knew that he wanted to improve.
“That’s the great thing about swimming,” Um said. “You can always get better.”
His specialty has always been breaststroke, but he also enjoys the 200-yard medley relay.
Um has always had a passion for swimming, and admitted that although the “practices are awful, there is nothing like winning a race.” He said, “I love racing. I love that intensity when you’re right next to someone, and you just want to beat them. That sense of competitiveness is like no other.”
Um’s passion earned him the opportunity to coach “10 and under” swimmers for a local club team this past summer. 
“I really want to help young athletes succeed and share my love for swimming,” he said.
Um also has noticed a difference between competing for Carnegie Mellon and competing for other swim teams. “When I’m out here, I’m not just competing for myself. Obviously I want to do well individually, but really, [swimming for Carnegie Mellon,] I feel like I’m swimming for my teammates,” he said.
Um emphasized the camaraderie of the swim team, which is highlighted by the team’s annual training trip. For the second half of winter break, the team travels down to Orlando, Fla., where in addition to intensive swimming, they spend time bonding and “soaking up the sun,” he said.
“It is definitely something I look forward to every year,” Um said. “I love just hanging out with everyone.”
He also stressed the importance of the team’s relationship with the coaching staff, comprised of head coach Matt Kinney and assistant coaches Kellie Ayres and Miki Silver.
“The swimming coaches are wonderful and add to the excellent chemistry of the team,” Um said. “It would be really hard to improve without their constant support.”
When he’s not swimming or participating in his other hobbies, such as playing pool, Um studies mechanical engineering. “It’s a boatload of work, but swimming definitely helps me destress,” he said.
Um sets his goals high as he remains optimistic for the rest of the season. “Nationals is our number-one team goal. And I absolutely think we can do it,” he said.

The men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams dominated another home meet. This weekend, the Tartans hosted three schools in the Carnegie Mellon annual quad home meet: Allegheny College, the University of Rochester, and Washington & Lee University.
Both Tartan teams swept the field. 
The men defeated Allegheny College 178–84, University of Rochester 185–77, and Washington & Lee University 132.50–129.50. 
The women performed just as well, defeating Allegheny College 168–84, University of Rochester 149–108, and Washington & Lee University 194–163.
“Saturday’s meet was a great meet for us. We really showed our depth as a men’s team by taking so many of the top spots,” junior Austin Bohn said. “We have a huge freshman class and they really stepped up like we need them to. Our goals are set really high for the end of the season, so this is a good place to start. We’re looking forward to the next meet.”
In the freestyle races, first-years Christopher Wysocki and Steven Geier placed first in the 1,000-yard and 200-yard freestyle, respectively, with season-best times. Wysocki finished with a time of 9:53.73 and Geier finished with a time of 1:45.38. Geier also placed first in the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 4:47.35.
Bohn took first place in the 100-yard breaststroke with a time of 1:00.36, while sophomore Cole Um took first in the 200-yard breaststroke with a time of 2:13.50. 
Senior Brandon Yee put the Tartans on the board in butterfly, taking first in the 200-yard butterfly with a time of 1:55.69.
On the women’s side, the Tartans took first in the 200-yard medley relay with a young team of first-years, Kira Singhaus swimming butterfly and Shieri Suzuka swimming breaststroke. They were joined by junior duo of Tatiana Duchak swimming backstroke and Soleil Phan swimming freestyle, who finished the relay in 1:50.42.
Phan also won the 200-yard and 500-yard freestyle. First-year standout Felicia Wang won the 100-yard and 200-yard breaststroke with times of 1:07.15 and 2:30.65, respectively.
In the longest event of the meet, sophomore Kaeli Halbersleben placed first in the 1,000-yard freestyle after a grueling 10:59.00 swim.
The Tartans have Thanksgiving break off before traveling to Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, to compete in the Total Performance Invitational, a three-day meet starting Nov. 29.

The Steelers overcame the injuries sustained by their veteran team for much of the season and prevailed, earning a 6–3 record and placing themselves in the middle of the playoff hunt.
Defensive starters James Harrison and Troy Polamalu missed significant time, all three running backs (Rashard Mendenhall, Issac Redman, and Jonathon Dwyer) have been fighting nagging injuries, and play-making wide receiver Antonio Brown is still out with an ankle injury. All of these setbacks, as well as the loss of starting quarterback Ben Roethlisberger to a sprained throwing shoulder and damaged ribs, may be too much to overcome.
Since Roethlisberger’s debut in 2004, he has only missed 13 games, with four of those coming from his suspension during the 2010 season. In these games, the Steelers played well, going 8–5, but four of the five losses came against the division rival Baltimore Ravens, which the Steelers are set to play against in upcoming games.
Roethlisberger is known for his toughness and ability to play well through pain and injury. Unfortunately, his toughness doesn’t matter here, since his rib injury threatens to cut his aorta and kill him if he gets hit before being fully healed. Because of the risks involved, Roethlisberger is sidelined indefinitely until the doctors can confirm he is no longer at risk.
Stepping in for Roethlisberger will be journeyman backup Byron Leftwich, who last started a game in 2009 for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Leftwich has been criticized for his slow release and limited mobility, both of which will be amplified by offensive coordinator Todd Haley’s new offensive scheme, as well as the injured and porous offensive line.
Thankfully for the Steelers, Roethlisberger’s injury comes at a time when the rest of the team is getting healthier. All three running backs are finally healthy, and the athletes on the Steelers’ defense are getting healthier and playing more like they have in the past. The play-making abilities of wide receivers Mike Wallace and Emmanuel Sanders, along with the consistency of tight end Heath Miller, complete this improvement.
The Pittsburgh season rests in the hands of Leftwich and his ability to protect the football, as well as in the defense, which will need to clamp down and make up for the significantly less potent Steeler offense. In his games as a starter with the Jacksonville Jaguars, Atlanta Falcons, and Buccaneers, Leftwich went a mediocre 24–25. If the Steelers only win half their games the rest of the season, the team is looking at a 10–6 or 9–7 record, which places them on the wild card bubble.
With five of their last seven games coming up against division rivals, the Steelers will need to play well to win the division and guarantee themselves a playoff spot. Right now, the Steelers sit two games behind the Ravens in the division, after a loss to the Ravens on Sunday.  If the Steelers lose to the Ravens again in two weeks, a playoff appearance might be lost.
The Steelers will need to revert back to the “ground and pound” team they once were, relying on their running games to move the ball down the field and control the time of possession while the defense forces turnovers to create short fields, holding the other team in check.
Roethlisberger’s injury exemplifies the Steelers’ season of injuries, as they field the oldest starting defense in the NFL. The Steelers needs to stay healthy to still have a shot at the playoffs. They will have to hope that Roethlisberger is healthy by January in order to have any chance at making noise in the postseason, but if the first half of the season is any indicator, the odds of the Steelers keeping the injury report clean for the rest of the season is slim.

The men’s cross country team hit the road this weekend and traveled to Terre Haute, Ind., to compete in the Division-III Championships. The top five runners’ scores were factored in to earn the Tartans a No. 17 place finish out of 32 teams.
“Nationals was an incredible experience, it’s amazing being around so many elite athletes. Not all of us had our best race today, but the fact that the Tartans got 17th in the nation on a bad day reflects just how great our team was this season,” junior Josh Newby said. “We’ve all been working our tails off nearly every day since the beginning of the summer and it’s great that the work has paid off in such a big way.”
The first Tartan to cross the finish line was senior Evan Gates, who completed the eight kilometer race with a time of 25:10.8. Sophomore George Degen and Newby finished within 20 seconds of each other with times of 25:29.3 and 25:49.5, respectively. The final two runners to add to the Tartans’ score were juniors Ken Murphy, who finished in 26:03.4, and Brendan O’Hara, who finished at 26:19.8.
“I don’t think we had our best race, but to have finished equal to our pre-meet ranking on an off day is very satisfying. Everyone except Evan was running his first national meet, and it was very different from any meet we had run before,” senior Graham Shorr said. “I think the underclassmen can look forward to building off this year’s experience, and the seniors can be proud of leading the team back to nationals.”
This race was the last of this season’s cross country campaign. The Tartans ended the season with two first-place finishes and two second-place finishes.
“Coach Donatelli and assistant coach Mallory designed our training for us to peak right now, and it worked,” Newby said. “All of us on the bus driving home right now are in high spirits and looking forward to heading to nationals again next year.”

In the final game of the season, the Tartans took on the Waynesburg University Yellow Jackets in the Eastern College Athletic Conference Southwest Bowl on Saturday. In a closely fought game, the Tartans came up just short, losing 28–24.
Junior quarterback Rob Kalkstein set three single-season records at season’s end. Kalkstein threw for 188 yards on 10 of 19 total passes with two touchdowns. The 188 yards put Kalkstein at 2,148 yards, passing Thomas Hubka’s record set in 1967. Kalkstein also broke Hubka’s record of 127 completions in a single season, throwing 136 in this campaign. Additionally, his .624 completion percentage tops graduated quarterback Phil Pantalone’s .623 percentage from 2009.
“With all the injuries we’ve had at running back, we really needed a stronger passing game that we’ve had in the past. Rob stepped up,” said senior cornerback Sam Thompson.
Junior wide receiver Tim Kikta was electric in this game, averaging 30.8 yards per reception on 154 total receiving yards. Kikta had a touchdown catch as well.
Junior running back Michael Trentalange rushed seven times for 100 yards. Senior fullback Jared Delello had the only rushing touchdown in the game for the Tartans.
The Tartans faltered in stopping the run. Yellow Jacket running backs Bertrand Ngampa and Dominic Moore rushed for nearly 300 yards combined, 170 and 110 yards, respectively. Ngampa rushed for one touchdown and Moore found the end zone twice.
Junior inside linebacker Akwasi Brefo and senior outside linebacker Nick Karabin led the defense in tackles, each with 11.
Senior cornerback Liam McGrath had an interception for his seventh on the season. His seventh pick ties him with Thompson last season and Andy Helms in 1991 for most interceptions in a single season.
The Tartans finished 6–5 on the season. After a 4–0 start, the Tartans began to struggle, but the hot start was enough to land them in a bowl game.
Despite the loss, many Tartan players were able to make Carnegie Mellon history in this final game.

A team from Carnegie Mellon recently obtained first place at the regional level of the Association for Computing Machinery International Collegiate Programming Contest (ACM-ICPC), one of the biggest college programming contests in the world, on Nov. 3.
Composed of senior computer science major Nathaniel Barshay, computer science Ph.D. student Yan Gu, and senior computer science and mathematics double major Jonathan Paulson, the team surpassed 130 others from the northeastern U.S. and Canada. Their win qualifies them for the ACM-ICPC World Finals, which will take place in St. Petersburg, Russia, this summer from June 30 to July 4.
“It was a lot of fun,” Paulson said. “A lot of the problems on this particular contest were brute force. It was pretty easy to see what the answer was, but it was hard to code up the solution.”
The competition required members of each team to solve nine complex programming problems in five hours. One of the problems was inspired by a physical game. Say you are given seven hexagons with the numbers one through six written on the sides, and you want to rotate the pieces so that the matching numbers line up. The solution will have one hexagon in the center and six surrounding it. You can pick up the center piece, move it somewhere else and move another piece to the center. The teams had to find an arrangement that solved this puzzle or declare that there was no solution.
“That’s an example of a problem which is brute force,” Paulson said. “You pick the hexagon that is going to go in the center and then you pick the one that is going to go above it.” Knowing that the numbers should match up, there was only one possible rotation for the second hexagon. The next step was to pick the third hexagon that matches.
“You are going to try all possible hexagons to go in the center — there are seven,” Paulson said. Then there are six hexagons from which you can pick the next one and so on. “You just try every possible solution,” he added. Since there were not many possible solutions, the algorithm was fast.
The Carnegie Mellon team was the only one that was able to solve the most difficult problem, a geometry problem. Given four completely arbitrary points on a plane, they had to build a fence around the four points such that every is five feet away from the fence. The fence is supposed to be a square and every point should be closest to a different, unique side of the fence.
“That’s the weird condition,” Paulson said. “The other tricky thing is that the square can be rotated; it’s not necessarily horizontal.”
Paulson wrote his code in the Java programming language, while his teammates used C++. They had trained for a minimum of seven hours each week since the beginning of the semester.
Carnegie Mellon offers the course “Competition Programming,” which Paulson said is good practice for the contest. The course is being taught every semester by computer science professor Danny Sleator, who is the head coach of the team. “The course also gives good practice for Google Code Jam, Facebook Hackathon, and job interviews,” Paulson said. “I think these programming contests are getting more popular.”
In total, Carnegie Mellon sent five teams to the regional competition. The rule is that the top four teams advance in competition, with only one team being allowed to represent each school. Although the other Carnegie Mellon teams got fourth, fifth, sixth, and 23rd place, none of them got to advance.
“The other teams from CMU were our biggest competition,” Paulson said. “We were pretty sure we would be in the top four schools, but we were worried about the other teams from CMU beating us.”
One of the tough parts of the competition is that there is only one computer for each team. “Everyone has a copy of the problem set,” Paulson said. Everyone reads the problems and thinks about them. When a person is sure that they know the right answer and can write the code, he or she can use the computer.
“Whoever thinks that they need the computer for the shortest time for a problem, gets it,” Paulson said. The teammates usually try to work on different problems simultaneously. For the hardest problems at the end, there might be two people working on them, but in general, this is not advised.
“We had two people coding and the last person was just thinking about problems. His job was to find the hardest problems and solve them so that we don’t get stuck on those at the end,” Paulson explained.

5-hour Energy linked to 13 deaths
Over the past four years, the energy shot 5-hour Energy has been shown to be possibly linked to 13 deaths. A summary of FDA records by The New York Times reported that “5-hour Energy has been mentioned in some 90 filings, more than 30 that involved serious or life-threatening injuries like heart attacks, convulsions and, in one case, a spontaneous abortion."
Living Essentials, LLC — the distributor of the product — didn't respond to written inquiries regarding the beverage, and did not disclose how much caffeine it contained. It appears that adverse effects are not limited to 5-hour Energy alone. Last year, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration reported that 13,000 emergency room visits in 2009 were related to energy drinks.

NASA orders all data to be encrypted after lost laptop
After losing a portable computer two weeks ago, NASA has ordered that all its electronic data be encrypted. The laptop, which was stolen Oct. 31 from NASA headquarters in Washington D.C., contained personal and sensitive information. Although it was locked, it is still susceptible to hacking since the data wasn’t encrypted.
In response, NASA has warned all employees to be wary of potential phishing schemes, such as suspicious emails. To avoid future security breaches, CIO Linda Cureton has set a target to encrypt all of NASA’s portable computers within a month, and has forbidden employees from storing sensitive information on their personal electronic devices.

Increasing number of strokes among young adults
Although strokes are mainly thought to affect individuals aged 60 and older, recent studies revealed they are becoming more common in younger people. Michelle Nimmerrichter was 20 years old when she suffered a stroke in 2011 that left her in a coma. Her stroke was caused by a blood clot, either induced by a genetic abnormality in her blood or by a blood-thickening hormonal contraceptive she was taking. She underwent three weeks of treatment before recovery.
Doctors say it is important for young people such as Nimmerrichter to recognize signs of a stroke, so they can be treated quickly and effectively. The signs include weakness or numbness in any part of the body; trouble speaking, understanding, seeing, or walking; dizziness; or severe, unusual headaches. It is imperative to remember not to dismiss such signs in young people.

Two companies make advances in biofuel production
Two companies recently announced developments that will allow the large-scale commercial production of biofuel. KiOR, in Columbus, Miss., built a factory that mixes shredded wood waste with a catalyst that removes oxygen from the wood and processes the rest into fuel. 
Ineos, an oil and chemical company based in Europe, built a plant in Florida that cooks wood until it breaks down to hydrogen and carbon monoxide. These molecules are pumped into a steel tank filled with bacteria, which will consume them and excrete ethanol. KiOR aims to produce 13 million gallons of fuel and Ineos aims to produce 8 million gallons of ethanol annually.
While the methods used by both companies make biofuel production far more efficient, there is still skepticism as to whether the reliability will outweigh the costs of production.

Light exposure at night linked to depression
A study conducted at Johns Hopkins revealed that excessive exposure to light from lamps and handheld devices at night is linked to depression and slower cognitive function. The research team studied the reaction of mice to a cycle of three-and-a-half hours of light and three-and-a-half hours of darkness.
The mice in the study had an increased level of cortisol — a stress hormone linked to learning issues — and showed signs of depression, such as declining interest in sugar or pleasurable activities. The team believes excessive light exposure will have the same effect on humans since both species have intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, which react to bright light.

Malaria-carrying birds reach Alaskan territory
Mosquitoes that carry plasmodium, a parasite that causes malaria in birds, have been transported throughout North America via birds for millennia. Recently, the mosquitoes have made their way to Fair Banks, Ala. Most species of birds have developed an immunity to the plasmodium. 
Due to climate change, the birds which carry mosquitoes with plasmodium are traveling further north, and are expected to reach the Arctic Circle by 2080. While plasmodium does not affect humans, its northern spread is an object of concern because it may affect birds that have never been exposed to the parasite.

Imagine robots that can survive in and respond to disasters. Relief efforts, like those recently mobilized for Hurricane Sandy, would employ machines to complete tasks that would normally pose large risks to humans. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon are developing prototypes that may help in these dire situations.
Three Carnegie Mellon robotics teams were selected to compete in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics challenge and now have a chance to win $2 million. The teams are split into Track A, which includes the Tartan Rescue Team, and Track B, which consists of Team Steel and RE2.
The Tartan Rescue Team is led by Tony Stentz, a research professor of robotics and the director of the National Robotics Engineering Center. Team Steel is led by Christopher Atkeson, a professor in the Robotics Institute and the Human-Computer Interaction Institute. RE2 is a team led by the Robotics Institute’s spinoff company, RE2 Inc.
DARPA has split the competition into two parts: a virtual competition this June and a live hardware challenge in December 2013 and December 2014. While Track A receives $3 million in funding from DARPA to develop both software and hardware, Track B teams receive $375,000 to only develop software.
Both tracks will work on individual robots and equip them to complete physically challenging tasks in response to dangerous human-engineered environments. DARPA’s ultimate goal is to have robots provide disaster relief in place of humans, who would risk their lives to do the same tasks with less efficiency and effectiveness.
According to Atkeson, the robots will have to complete a series of actions: getting in a car, driving, getting out of a car, walking through a field of debris, opening a blocked door, climbing a ladder, turning a valve, and connecting a cable. 
In a university press release, DARPA program manager Gill Pratt explained that the challenge is designed to create a bridge that allows innovators to build more capable, affordable robots that are easier for nonexperts to operate.
While the Tartan Rescue Team will build software for its own robot, Team Steel and RE2 will create software programs for Atlas, a humanoid robot developed by Boston Dynamics, to use in the hardware challenge. Atlas will have arms, legs, a head, cameras for eyes, and a laser scanner to measure distance between objects.
“We will make the robot capable of walking over rough terrain, and manipulating [objects in the surrounding areas],” Atkeson said via email.
Besides striving to reach DARPA’s objectives, Atkeson also plans to lead the National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center on Quality of Life Technology to develop technology that assists the old and disabled. Atkeson, who has been working on humanoids for 30 years, started research in his field because he was inspired to build robots that help people. He also wanted to understand how people work and achieves this through building artificial ones.
“I have to understand how humans are so skillful and enable robots to attain human-skill levels,” Atkeson explained in the email.
The DARPA Robotics challenge is an opportunity for him to reach his goal, since the competition requires the robots to achieve agile behavior in a complex environment. Ultimately, all teams in the DARPA competition have a similar goal: to significantly impact the human community.

The pulse of drums, Indian rhythms, and techno beats filled the air of the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall this past Saturday for the sixth annual Bhangra in the Burgh competition. Nearly 2,500 people filled the space to watch bhangra teams from across North America dance to win.
The event was highly anticipated, as its organizers had been advertising and tabling for over a month before the competiton. “The planning process for BIB6 began before the academic year with countless man hours being spent on the event. The level of organization was very impressive,” said first-year statistics major and operations committee member Vinay Viswanathan.
The competition showcased eight bhangra teams, each of which was introduced with a video that gave a preview of the team’s members and core values. The competing teams were: First Class Bhangra, UVA Di Shaan, Virginia Tech Bhangra, Cal Bhangra, GMU Bhangra, Toronto Allstar Girls, Cornell Bhangra, and UNC Bhangra Elite.
Each team brought great talent to the stage, making for an impressive, powerful event that kept the audience pumped. Whenever a team was announced, the yells and cheers of that team’s fans could be heard loud and clear. But despite the competition, the atmosphere remained friendly; the teams recognized that they were not only competing against each other, but also promoting the art of bhangra, and were supportive and respectful of the other teams.
The show included other non-bhangra dance groups, as well as Carnegie Mellon’s own South Asian all-male a cappella group, Deewane. Carnegie Mellon’s Tanah and DS Company and Point Park University’s Impulse provided a look into the world of hip-hop and artistic dance, a good change of pace from the competitive bhangra.
When Carnegie Mellon’s bhangra team took the stage, the excitement in the air was palpable: This was what many had come for. The team staged a lively performance, which was made even more exciting when all of the nonperforming members and alumni, dressed in bhangra team jackets, joined the performers on stage. With the stage filled, Carnegie Mellon Bhangra provided a passionate ending to the evening.
Comedian Dan Nainan kept the energy up by amusing the audience between acts. Although Nainan’s sense of humor occasionally leaned toward the racially offensive, his charm and wit were effective in transitioning from act to act.
The show ran smoothly with few technical glitches. The colorful lighting and the loud pulse of the music made the event feel more like a concert than a dance competition. During admission, audience members were able to keep themselves fueled for the excitement of the second half by purchasing inexpensive samosas.
There were five judges for the event, but audience members could also vote for their favorite team to win the People’s Choice Award by voting on the event’s webpage. Unfortunately, by the time the results were announced, many people in the audience had already left. Cal Bhangra, Cornell Bhangra, and the Toronto Allstar Girls took the first, second, and third spots respectively, while UNC Bhangra Elite took the People’s Choice Award.
All proceeds of Bhangra in the Burgh 6 went to Variety the Children’s Charity of Pittsburgh, which provides custom bicycles for disabled children. Charles LaVallee, a member of the Variety team and a Carnegie Mellon graduate, showed a video of a mentally disabled man first learning to ride a bike. He discussed how important something as simple as learning to ride can be for both kids and their families. His speech served as a reminder that nothing should be taken for granted.
Overall, the event was an enlightening and enjoyable cultural experience. “I came out wanting to do Bhangra. I’d definitely go again next year,” said first-year biology major Myriam Bejjani.

During his time at Carnegie Mellon, literary agent Rubin Pfeffer (CFA ’74) never imagined being immersed in the publishing world. But Pfeffer is now a partner at East West Literary Agency, an agency specializing in children’s and young adult literature, where he brokers deals for clients who want to publish their manuscripts.
Pfeffer’s career path did not unfold overnight. When he graduated with a degree in graphic design, he was hired by publishing house Harcourt Brace Jovanovich as a designer. Although he was engaged as an artist for Harcourt, he was attracted to the larger world of publishing. His fascination with the strategic role of design in the publishing business brought him into all aspects of the business — editing, sales, rights, and marketing.
Pfeffer eventually worked his way up to becoming the president of Harcourt. He spent close to 30 years there before working as chief creative officer for Pearson Education, a publisher of textbooks and trade books. In 2005, Pfeffer was hired by publisher Simon & Schuster to be senior vice president of the children’s books section. He stayed at Simon & Schuster for four years before becoming a consultant for various media groups and opening up the Boston office of the East West Literary Agency in 2010.
With a career of more than 35 years in the publishing industry, Pfeffer can now speak with authority on the qualities of good writing. “Great literature is one that stands the test of time,” he said.
The Napping House, a children’s picture book about a house full of sleeping animals and a granny, is still being read through the generations after Pfeffer first published it in 1984. The book was illustrated and written by Don and Audrey Wood, a husband and wife team, and is still in print.
“We are often given credit for helping to ‘raise the bar’ in children’s illustration, and Rubin definitely had his shoulder under one end of that bar,” Don Wood said via email. “The lesson Rubin taught me was now ingrained. Pull out all stops, go for it. There is no such thing as ‘just a children’s book.’ ”
Not every writer will be as successful as the Woods were, but there are principles all writers can adopt, Pfeffer said. “One thing that writers can learn is writing for different audiences,” he explained, citing late children’s author Maurice Sendak as an example. Where the Wild Things Are, Sendak’s seminal work, is memorable in its ability to explore complex, mature issues for young readers. This book still resonates with these same readers as adults, who in turn share the book with their own children.
To be a best-selling children’s book author, a writer must deliver content that resonates with readers emotionally. “Great children’s writing is innovative and fresh,” Pfeffer said. “It has memorable characters and tells an exciting story.”
One of Pfeffer’s responsibilities as a literary agent is providing his clients with information on the publishing industry. The purpose of the publishing industry is to sell books: It’s a business. Cover designs, reviews, and marketing tactics are all part of turning a profit, even on the children’s writing level, and agents must explain this to clients.
“Writing is very special and the process is personal to each writer,” Pfeffer said. “An agent must be straightforward with clients and deliver encouragement and feedback, even if it isn’t what the client wants to hear.” At East West, he brings his knowledge of publishing and his experience with high-profile clientele. In his career, he has worked with Alice Walker (The Color Purple) and Umberto Eco (The Name of the Rose).
One of Pfeffer’s clients is Patricia MacLachlan, author of Sarah, Plain and Tall. The book tells the story of a family living on the American prairie, awaiting the arrival of the father’s new wife. The novel was adapted into a screenplay starring Christopher Walken and Glenn Close, and received a host of awards, including a Newbery Medal.
“The qualities of Rubin’s I most admire are these — he is incredibly ethical,” MacLachlan said via email. “He takes care of my business life in a very honest and straightforward manner. In truth, he takes care of my writing life in the same way, coupled with sensitivity to me as a writer dealing with the changing world of publishing. He knows me well, and very kindly points out the pieces of mine that don’t work as they are written. He is inspiring and supportive and has helped my career in huge ways. And on a more personal level, my entire family considers Rubin a close and trusted friend.”
Everything Pfeffer knows about the publishing industry came from experience. He recommends that students seeking experience in the publishing industry read voraciously and consider internships at publishing houses and literary agencies.
And for aspiring writers out there, Pfeffer said that writing from the heart is what matters most: “Write what you know and feel. If it’s a good story, it will connect with people and affect them.”

Fans of graphic novels, fantasy movies, and the television series Doctor Who all poured into Carnegie Music Hall on Wednesday evening. Despite being fans of varying artistic mediums, they all had one thing in common: Their favorite pieces were written by British author Neil Gaiman, famous for such works as Coraline, American Gods, and The Sandman comic book series.
Gaiman visited Pittsburgh to present “An Evening of Stardust,” celebrating the 15th anniversary of his award-winning novel Stardust. The talk was organized by Pittsburgh Arts & Lectures, which proudly hosted Gaiman for his first-ever public appearance in Pittsburgh. In fact, it was the only city he visited on his one-destination tour, making this night even more special for local fans.
Gaiman had a captivating presence on stage. Members of the audience leaned forward to get a glimpse of him from the top balcony, and the room was silently quivering with excitement as everyone hung onto every word he said. His live reading from Stardust still captivated listeners, even though most of them had probably already read the book or seen the movie adaptation. It was clear that Gaiman is a natural storyteller — both on paper and in person.
It was also evident that Gaiman’s creative ideas for his fantasy works were not carefully plotted out, but were rather the result of the bizarre turns his imagination would take. The creative process behind his fantasy novel Stardust was beautifully simplistic: Gaiman explained how he wrote it in longhand, using a fountain pen, to emulate the ’20s vibe he wanted the novel to have.
He described the night the idea for Stardust was conceived: He saw a shooting star and wondered, “What if I found the shooting star and it was a great glowing diamond?” After a long pause, he said matter-of-factly, “Or what if it was a girl with a broken leg? Because that’s how my mind works.” The audience erupted into laughter at how such a brilliant idea for a book could arise so simply.
Gaiman’s gift for storytelling became even clearer when he read from his upcoming book to be released on June 18. The Ocean at the End of the Lane is Gaiman’s latest work of fiction, in which a seven-year-old boy finds a dead opal miner in the trunk of a car, prompting a strange series of events. Gaiman revealed that this work is “a particularly personal novel”; the Hempstock family in the novel had been brewing in his mind since childhood.
He was genuinely relieved by the booming round of applause that followed his reading, explaining that he had been nervous to see the audience’s reaction. This kind of behavior made Gaiman seem down-to-earth and relatable — far from pretentious. At one point, he took a moment to pause and admire the twinkly light display behind him, entranced by the star-like effect.
In one self-deprecating and hilarious anecdote, Gaiman explained how as a child he was awful at sports because he would get distracted — only to be rudely awoken when a ball smacked him on the head. The audience was in hysterics as Gaiman shared this humbling story; no doubt many of the creative minds in attendance could relate.
The floor was then opened up for questions from the audience. Several guests bugged Gaiman for details on his upcoming Doctor Who episode; he wrote an award-winning episode of the British television show last year. Gaiman boasted that he would make the Cybermen (robotic Doctor Who villains) scary again. The author also touched on the topics of female roles in fantasy fiction, saying that he believes they are more prominent now than in the past. He joked, “You could shoot a machine gun at random through the pages of The Lord of the Rings and never hit a woman.”
Gaiman ended the night saying, “If your question is how do you find magic, how do you find adventure? You go out, and you make it. And you make it for other people.” With all the magic Gaiman has given his fans over the years, and with the magic he brought to the stage that evening, this thought certainly resonated with his audience.

There’s something about free classical music on a cold day that warms the heart and feeds the soul, and that’s exactly what the School of Music did on Tuesday with its chamber music concert.
No one said a word as the concert began, which somehow seemed appropriate. The lack of chatter allowed listeners to put the spoken word to rest for a few minutes and concentrate on nothing but the sweet notes of ageless classics.
The concert, which featured three quartets, was nothing less than perfection. The opening piece, Quatuor Concertant, composed by Vincenzo Gambaro, was a woodwind quartet composed of master’s student in French horn performance Jackie Perez, master’s student in bassoon performance Hyunwook Bae, sophomore flute performance major Michal Zeleny, and master’s student in clarinet performance Charlotte Kies.
Zeleny’s playing was energetic yet controlled, and served as the group’s glue, for the second movement especially. With sharp, crisp notes, the flute’s lead was fluid and strong. Later in the piece, the clarinet and bassoon took over this melody in a charming duet that was wholesome and calming, contributing to the overall impression of the first piece.
In the middle was Mozart, and where there’s Wolfgang Amadeus, there’s never disappointment. Master’s student in violin performance John Kruer, senior violin performance major Kashi Elliot, master’s viola performance major Sooyi Kang, and master’s cello performance major Sarah Lee presented String Quartet No. 15 in D Minor.
The quartet may as well have been dancing on their instruments. The piece was wonderfully Wolfgang, with magnificent crescendos at all the right points. It featured balanced tones and voices, blending for a perfectly paced Allegro and a full-bodied orchestral sound from just four instruments mastered by some serious players.
The best piece, Joseph Haydn’s Op. 76 No. 5 in D major, was performed last by the Starling String Quartet. The piece was a surprise, spirited enough to surpass the Mozart that preceded it. The performers — Artist’s Certificate student in violin performance Erica Richardson, senior violin performance major Erica Hudson, Artist’s Certificate student in viola performance Ai-Wen Thian, and Marlene Ballena, a cello player in the Performance Residency Program — possessed a true synchronous energy, moving, playing, and even seeming to breathe as one.
The “Allegretto” first movement was bright, flowery, and cheerful, rising and soaring without ever seeming to come down from its ecstatic heights. Even the slower second movement still had an undeniable pulse of energy — albeit more relaxed and full — and featured unexpected viola and cello solos that were powerfully executed.
The final movement, “Finale Presto,” was the crème de la crème. From the striking first note through the runs of musical harmony that positively cavorted through the rest of the movement, the piece was purely stunning. The entire movement was energetic, upbeat, and inspiring: a perfect end to a perfect concert.
The massively unattended concert, which took place in McConomy Auditorium, redefined the phrase “intimate affair”: There were fewer than five people in the audience. This is a tragic example of how the relaxing power of classical music is underestimated today. Classical music is often regarded as aged and outdated, when in actuality, it’s as relevant and culturally enriching as it was during the century in which it was written.
Next time there’s a chill in the air, wander over to the School of Music and let the magic begin.

As temperatures in Pittsburgh go down, the number of puffy winter jackets, sweats, and UGG boots seen on campus goes up. This is understandable; it is cold outside, after all. However, there are other clothing options out there that are both fashionable and comfortable, making it possible to save those sweats for a lazy day.
Sweater weather is better weather
An alternative to a sweatshirt is a stylish sweater. A chunky sweater worn with leggings, socks, and boots can make for a trendy outfit without giving up comfort. Layer a long-sleeved T-shirt under your chunky sweater on colder days for extra warmth. 
Recently, a post on the Seventeen magazine website introduced sweater trends for the winter; one of the trends discussed is the classic Fair Isle sweater. This pattern will be in style for every cold-weather season, so it is a better investment than a sweater that will only be wearable for a few months. If the Fair Isle sweater interests you, consider the “Permafrost Tunic” from Free People.
Another major trend is the colorblocked sweater. Colorblocking has been in style for quite a while now, so a sweater with colorblocking is a great way to make a transition into the colder months. Madewell’s “Thermal Sweater in Colorblock Stripe” would look stylish with jeans and boots.
The edgy look has also been in style for the past couple of months, causing studs in every shape and size to appear on shoes, clothing, and jewelry. What better way to follow this trend than with a sweater that has stud detailing? Give this trend a try with the “Studded Denim Patch Jumper” from Topshop. But be careful: It’s important that the studs aren’t overdone.
Cardigans are versatile
Unlike other sweaters, cardigans can be worn with outfits that focus on a summer top or dress. However, they are similar to other types of sweaters in that they are warm — another layering staple. Longer cardigans look great when paired with dresses or skirts and tights. Shorter cardigans, in contrast, are better layered with a pretty shirt and a pair of jeans. Cardigans can also be found in the Fair Isle, colorblocked, and studded trends. Details on the backs of shirts are everywhere at the moment, so a cardigan with back detail, such as the “Kimchi Blue Back-Stitch Cardigan” from Urban Outfitters, is very trendy.
Leggings as pants?
No. As comfortable as leggings can be, they really are not meant to be worn as pants. For an alternative, invest in the J. Crew “Pixie Pants.” While just as comfortable, they are not as unforgiving as leggings, and are warmer as well. To mix things up and for added warmth, try the “Sweater Leggings” from Free People. While they may not be everyone’s taste, they can appear very stylish when paired correctly, such as with a tunic and short boots.
Accessories are a girl’s best friend
Layering scarves over outfits is the perfect way to tie a look together and stay warm. Infinity scarves are in style at the moment, so get one in a thicker knit for the colder weather. Want to keep your ears warm, but dislike hats? Opt for the “Knotted Ear Warmer” — basically a knitted headband — from Urban Outfitters. Layering knit socks under boots is another way to look fashionable in the winter.
Next time you want to settle for sweats, remember that there is a way to be warm and comfortable, but still look fashionable.

Explosions, slow motion, and battle scenes: These are elements one would expect to see in a high-budget action movie rather than on a stage. But last week’s National Theatre of Great Britain production of [ITAL]War Horse[ITAL] at the Benedum Center in Downtown pulled it off to great visual success — without CGI.
The production was infused with so many film-like elements it was hard to believe that the play preceded the Stephen Spielberg film adaptation. The set was minimal, aside from what looked like a torn white strip of paper that stretched across the back of the stage. On this white strip, moving projections of the landscape gave the audience a sense of place and movement and seemed to tread into film-like territory.
[ITAL]War Horse[ITAL] follows the story of English farm boy Albert (Andrew Veenstra) and his horse, Joey. When the first World War breaks out, the two are separated, and the rest of the play follows Albert on his struggle to be reunited with his beloved horse.
In terms of plot, those who had seen the film were at a clear advantage. It was often difficult to follow Joey and Albert through their disjointed wartime misfortunes, with little to connect the events of the drama except the characters themselves. Within the same two hours, the storyline jumps from Albert’s conflict with his drunken coward of a father (Brian Keane) to a German captain (Andrew May)’s decision to desert his troops. All the while, the heavy Cockney and German accents often muddled the dialogue, making it even harder to understand what was going on.
But the stunning visual elements of the play outweighed any plot shortcomings. The horses themselves were easily the most breathtaking part of the show. The Handspring Puppet Company built intricate life-sized mechanisms for the show that very closely replicated the appearance and movements of a horse, from the twitch of its ears to its galloping legs.
Various cast members guided these movements from inside and around the shell of the horse mechanism, and their moves were choreographed by director of movement and horse choreography Toby Sedgwick. In one particularly impressive fight scene, Joey and another horse face off in an aggressive dance of sorts; it was remarkable how seamlessly the cast members were able to step and leap in unison.
The animals were so lifelike that they even provided comic relief throughout the play. Gestures so simple as a sassy flick of Joey’s tail had the audience in stitches, and Albert’s family goose evoked hoots of laughter as it wheeled across the stage, frantically honking and flailing its wings. Most viewers probably would never have guessed that puppets, if designed right, could be so expressive.
In addition to the impressive puppet design, the production made great use of lighting, sound, and movement. The war-front setting for the majority of the film required a lot of creativity when it came to the visuals. In one battle scene, a violent explosion threw a cavalry officer from his horse: With the flashing, strobe-like lights and the use of slow motion as stage crew members carried the officer offstage, the audience was able to imagine the vivid scene.
Despite the impressive visuals, the production certainly wasn’t as sharply realistic as an action movie — but it gave the audience a challenge that few of today’s films present anymore.  Modern action movies do all of the imagining for us with their sharp, computer-generated displays of explosions and gore. It was incredible how much the directors of [ITAL]War Horse[ITAL] were able to pull off with such limited technology — but even the less realistic or believable elements had artistic merit of their own.

Have you ever wondered just how much information someone knows about you? Have you thought about what the inner workings of your brain would look like mapped out?
First-year students from Concept Studio I courses in the School of Art — taught by art professor Lowry Burgess and associate professor of art Andrew Johnson — joined together to respond to these questions through visual art. Displaying their work at The Frame Gallery, the artists utilized a variety of media — including photography, film, audio, and paint — to create a diverse set of final products. The exhibit opened this Friday, and features pieces ranging from a hamster wheel to a pamphlet that asks disconcerting personal questions.
Students taking the course with Burgess illustrate how their minds operate in an exhibit titled Mind Map. In her piece “Mind Maze,” first-year fine art major Nivetha Kannan describes her brain as a complicated labyrinth that is influenced by those who surround her. 
She encourages viewers at the gallery to metaphorically play with her mind by dropping marbles into a slanted maze with various final destinations at the bottom, similar to a Plinko Board. Like other pieces at the exhibit, Kannan’s work is interactive and, in turn, stimulates internal reflections.
Meanwhile, Johnson’s students produced works for the exhibit titled Big Brother, Where Art Thou?, which explores surveillance and human observation. In her piece “Relational Barriers,” first-year fine art major Carolina Vogt explained that intimate relations are barred by three things: words, the knowledge of someone’s past, and prevailing dispositions or tendencies. 
“I was focusing on exposing things that should be hidden, and then I got into this idea of human relations and what stops you from having a very intimate relation with someone,” Vogt said.
To depict the barrier of language, Vogt transcribed a letter written by her mother multiple times and realized that she did not understand the meaning of the words, no matter how many times she transcribed it. Her transcribed letters are on display next to a transparent surface with three dates embroidered upon it. The dates represent three important points in Vogt’s life. 
Vogt also created a door covered in pictures that portray her own disposition — the way she looks and acts when she is alone. All three facets of her piece are displayed with transparent materials to show how easily someone can learn about a person through elements of surveillance.
When experienced as a whole, the gallery effectively exudes the uneasiness people feel when they are being watched, as well as the quirkiness of the inner workings of the brain.
However, with no clear division between Mind Map and Big Brother, Where Art Thou?, it is often confusing to keep track of which concept the pieces are responding to. That said, the space is used effectively to ensure that the eye never stops moving from one visually interesting work to the next.
The gallery is only open until Saturday, so before leaving Pittsburgh for Thanksgiving break, take the time to experience the work of the talented students fostered in the College of Fine Arts. As first-year art major Emily Miller said to those invited to the opening, “Be a Vincent van Bro and Gogh.”

Knife-edge snares, buzzsaw drones, and panic-ridden vocals are the sounds that greet listeners of Ital’s newest album, Dream On. The Nov. 5 release is the second this year from Brooklyn’s Daniel Martin-McCormick, following his debut with Hive Mind in February.
Ital’s newest album, however, represents a dramatic departure from his previous work. While his penchant for distorted tech-noise and layered pop vocals has carried over in many of his songs, Dream On is primarily experimental, employing grotesque, abrasive sounds that do not resemble the joyful electronic tropes in previous songs like “Doesn’t Matter” or “Culture Club.” While some tracks, such as the opener “Despot,” fall into percussive house loops, the respite is never long, quickly turning to cascades of abrasive feedback and swells of flanged synths.
The song “What A Mess” most distinguishes the album’s atmosphere. It is filled with the distorted pleas of a woman asking Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn what he can do to help her uninsured husband, who has suffered a traumatic brain injury. Not only is the sample haunting in and of itself, but Martin-McCormick mutilates it so that it is heavily multitracked and has reverberative effects, finally smothered entirely by a dense organ chord. This unsettling theme is echoed in “Enrique” and “Eat Shit,” both of which begin with white noise and increasingly layer in discordant electronic samples. There is neither an apparent melody or an arcing structure or rhythm. The climax of both songs is a heavy shroud of pulsing drones, lasers, and skittering hi-hats.
While Martin-McCormick’s intention may have been to create postmodern house tracks reminiscent of the experimental dub-punk he produced under the moniker Sex Worker, the result is almost too horrific. Hive Mind, while still experimental, was not saturated with the heavy samples that overwhelm many of the songs in Dream On. Although Martin-McCormick is imaginative in his pairing of seemingly antagonistic sounds — such as jungle drum beats with metallic-sounding lasers — there are simply too many accessory noises. Unless people are actively listening, there is not enough structure to keep listeners’ attention for the entirety of the album.
The only song that seems to rise above this cacophony is “Boi,” a catchy, hip-hop-inspired house beat that thrives on thick drums, toms, and claps. The entire track is built around a vocal snippet from Beyoncé’s hit “Baby Boy”; though the reference is almost indiscernible within the mangled synths woven into the fabric of the song, there are remnants of subtle, deeply submerged melodic touches that produce a much-needed dance-floor vibe absent from the rest of the album.
Because Dream On persistently falls between rhythmic discipline and willful subversion, it is limited as a musical ensemble. While it has its moments, Ital’s newest release ultimately lacks the consistency and euphoria to be considered a dance album, yet is too intrusive to be played as background music. It is surely interesting as a study of experimental post-house grotesquerie, but Martin-McCormick’s notion of groove and abrasion do not work in parallel. Perhaps Ital is better suited to the features of his past studio efforts: clean, contained, and controlled.

Dear Patrick,
I just bought Assassin’s Creed 3 and Halo 4. They’re both awesome, but I can’t decide which one to play! I have a job already, so I don’t care about my classes or grades anymore. I can spend all my time playing.
Thanks,
Must Ascertain Some Technical Entertainment Relatively Currently, Help Inform of Electronic Findings
Dear MASTER CHIEF,
You face the classic gamer’s dilemma. On the one hand, Assassin’s Creed offers an awesome single-player experience; you get to hang out with George Washington, kill redcoats, and hear Benjamin Franklin’s eight-point dissertation on why sleeping with old women is best. On the other hand, Halo 4 is another Halo game. Enough said.
All you need to remember is that Assassin’s Creed is all about the single player, while Halo is all about multiple players. Play Assassin’s Creed 3 when you’re by yourself — during the day, when everyone’s going to class and you’re skipping — and save Halo for when your friends are over. Also, you might want to consider going to class. Graduating is probably a condition of that job offer.
At least you’ll have games to play when you’re unemployed,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
All my friends keep trying to get me to hit on women at bars, but I am so terrible at it that I wind up embarrassing myself. The last time I tried I just stood next to her at the bar for five minutes before walking away. What tips can you offer?
Thanks,
Sexy People Evade Eager Conversation, Hopelessly Lost Engaging Sensuous Señoritas
Dear SPEECHLESS,
The key is to pick off the weakest one from the herd. Essentially, if there’s a group of women sitting at the bar, don’t go for one in the middle; instead, talk to a girl on the edges. It’s harder for her to block you out that way.
Once you’ve managed to pick off a girl, tradition dictates that you offer to buy her a drink as the price of her conversation. Instead, take a step for gender equality and ask her to buy you a drink. If she’s a true third-wave feminist, she’ll happily comply. Once you’ve successfully made conversation, your friends can’t make fun of you, since they were probably trying to egg you on, or they’re just nice wingmen.
Or just try talking to a girl at literally any other place,
Patrick Hoskins

The Tartan claims that there are 4,856 international students at U.S. colleges for the 1911–12 school year. Sample statistics include 549 students from China, 415 from Japan, 123 from the Philippines, and 21 from Korea. It’s crazy to imagine, since over 1,000 international students make up today’s demographics at Carnegie Mellon.

Members of the Carnegie Mellon community engaged in discussion in Steinberg Auditorium last Friday during Nico Slate’s lecture on the connection between the freedom struggle of South Asians and African-Americans.
Slate, an assistant professor of history, referenced the research he conducted for his book Colored Cosmopolitanism: The Shared Struggle for Freedom in the United States and India to discuss how to create collaboration between peoples of color.
“There’s hope and optimism, but there’s also misunderstanding and misinterpretation. That’s what makes this history so rich,” Slate said.
Addressing what he called “colored cosmopolitanism” as something “strangely foreign, but strangely familiar,” he said, “In many ways, a world in which whites controlled things across the globe has tumbled and fell, but in many ways it hasn’t.”
Slate spoke of the work of activists, such as Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay and Pauli Murray, in bridging the African American fight for civil rights with the Indian freedom struggle.
He utilized the Indian term “satyagraha,” which means “holding firmly to the truth,” to refer to Murray’s civil disobedience and active efforts in the civil rights cause. 
Slate said that as a young student, Murray compared the advantages and disadvantages of fighting for freedom as an African-American to those of a South Asian.
The first major difference between the black freedom struggle and the Indian freedom struggle, he said, is the fact that in India, Indians were the majority and in America, blacks were the minority. 
Murray used this fact to demonstrate that not all tactics used in India can be directly implemented on the plight of African-Americans.
Moving on to describe an example, Slate addressed the tremendous amount of poverty in India due to class disparities as a result of the caste system.
Slate cited the example of a point of realization for Martin Luther King Jr. on a visit to India. 
“The principal of the school introduced MLK as an untouchable of the United States. Although King was at first insulted, he realized that his treatment in the States meant he was, in a sense, an untouchable. Then King went on to say, ‘I am an untouchable, and all of my people are untouchables.’ ”
Slate pointed out that in this way, King was connecting caste oppression in India to the oppression of African-Americans.
Slate said, “That conception of colored solidarity is still alive. Many young South Asians feel a sense of solidarity with African-American struggles, which has grown even stronger after 9/11, when racial profiling has targeted people of color.”
Slate said that President Barack Obama carried a large number of minority communities in the election. For example, 75 percent of the South Asian and Indian communities voted for Obama.
“Most Indians were happy that Obama was reelected, but not for all the right reasons. I think that they are mainly focused on Obama’s foreign policy to India, which, like President [George W.] Bush’s policy, has been warm and friendly,” Slate said.
“I think that most of the people in power in India think that Obama can inspire societal change, and is something I wish is more present,” he continued.
Students who attended the lecture had positive things to say.
“I’m in his global histories class, and he really emphasized the transnational aspect of this movement, which I found fascinating. I liked that he mentioned that we can create this solidarity and learn from it. We can learn from history and act on it today,” said Josh Levitson, a fourth-year piano performance and professional writing double major.
“I really liked the fact that he covered so much of the struggle for civil rights of different cultures, whether that be in America or India,” said Theophilus Onime, a first-year information systems major. 
“The freedom struggle is not just confined to one place, like we think it is,” he added.
Slate’s lecture was part of the Center for African-American Urban Studies and the Economy 2012–13 speaker series. 
The talk was also held in collaboration with The Senator John Heinz History Center Exhibit, “From Slavery to Freedom.”

Hoover Institute fellow and Stanford political science professor Morris Fiorina used statistics last Tuesday to explain the growing partisanship in American politics. Roughly 80 people attended the lecture, which was held in Margaret Morrison.
Titled “The Road to (and from) the 2012 Elections,” the presentation made substantial use of graphs and charts.
The lecture covered America’s background with respect to political divides, and the changes in partisanship in recent years. Despite the event’s title, Fiorina said, “There’s not much to say, since not much changed,” and that a lot of the data was not yet available for analysis about the recent election.
Fiorina gave a brief outline of which political party possessed the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the presidency since the year 2000, when “the Republicans won the political triple crown: the House, Senate, and the presidency.”
After 2006, when the Democrats ended the generation of the Republican majority, they hoped that they would be able to solidify political wins as the Republicans once had. James Carville published a book in 2009 titled, 40 More Years: How the Democrats Will Rule the Next Generation. Fiorina joked about the accuracy of these predictions, saying, “If you want this book, Amazon will give it to you for 60 percent off.”
He explained that “we are now in what political scientists call ‘the era of divided government.’ ”
In 26 of the past 32 years, the U.S. has had a divided government determined by at least one party possessing the House, Senate, or presidency.
“In the past six years we’ve had four elections, each with different patterns of instructional control. This is extreme electoral instability,” Fiorina said. 
He explained that this was the second worst period of electoral instability in American history.
Fiorina called the  worst time in American history “the Period of No Decision,” which lasted between the 1870s and 1890s.
Fiorina later revealed the parallels between society during that time and our current situation. Both periods experienced globalization, economic transformation, internal population movement, mass immigration, and rising economic inequality.
He also said, “That era, like ours, was an era of party sorting.” Party sorting and polarization occur when the more extreme ends of a political spectrum are adopted by their respective parties.
“Democrats are now a definite liberal party, the Republicans are now a definite conservative party,” Fiorina said. He explained the fact that each party is moving toward their further extreme wings.
Using more figures, this time on political stances of congressmen, Fiorina claimed that “the most conservative Democrat is now often to the left of the most liberal Republican.” He showed that this was not necessarily true throughout the previous eras of American history.
Part of this polarization, Fiorina revealed, is due to the increasing role and influence of activists in politics.
“The tiny hardcore [element] of each party gives us the choices we face,” he said, illustrating this point by showing that really only a small percentage of total eligible voters turned out at primaries where former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, a more extreme Republican presidential candidate, won.
However, Fiorina was careful to establish that this growing partisanship was not a direct result from the American people’s views: “Americans are uninformed, and for the most part confused and ambivalent.”
Fiorina contrasted viewing figures for political debates and pundit programs with those of American Idol and other popular television shows, each separated by at least 15 percent.
Fiorina emphasized that he believes the American public is nonpartisan. “In general the American electorship is extreme, they’re pragmatic,” he said, proceeding to show a graph illustrating no real increase in partisanship in the American public.
The presentation briefly addressed other issues such as campaign financing, the future of the Republican party and its ideologies, and a lack of party compromising. After his lecture, Fiorina solicited questions from the audience, often tying them in to reinforce his points.
Fiorina ended by emphasizing, “I’m an optimist, but, in a 40-year career I’ve never been more concerned about what the future might hold than now.”
Stanley Krasner, a sophomore economics and mathematics double major, said, “The use of convincing statistics to discuss political opinions is a not-new, but growing, trend. Coming from a quantitative background, I see why people like data, even though they may not be able to interpret all of it. His data helped analyzing the past, but isn’t very effective at predicting the future.”
Tonya Sedgwick, a sophomore decision science major, said, “I thought it was very interesting. The graphical comparison of history was helpful in many parts.... It was a very good analysis of something, but not a lot of conclusion on where to go.”
Fiorina, who received his bachelor’s degree from Allegheny College and his master’s and doctorate degrees from the University of Rochester, referenced his Pittsburgh background at the beginning of his talk. 
“Thank all of yinz for coming out,” he announced, referencing the popular Pittsburgh slang.
The lecture was presented as a Center for International Relations and Politics event, and was sponsored by the Quantitative Social Science Scholars program.

Despite the high costs of a U.S. education, more international students are enrolling at North American colleges. According to a recent article in the U.S. News & World Report, the number of international students enrolling in the 2012–13 school year increased 5.7 percent over the 2011–12 enrollment, with the majority of international students coming from Asia.
Carnegie Mellon is no stranger to international students. More than 20 percent of its student body is from another country, and the university has a dedicated Department of International Education to assist with financial aid, English skills, and career options after graduation.
Senior business administration major Parikshit Mistry from India said that he decided to travel overseas for his education for the career prospects. “Just saying that you got a degree from an American college opens up so many job opportunities back home in India,” Mistry said. “I want to work in the United States when I graduate, but I might want to return to India later.”
Mistry said his biggest challenge adapting to a U.S. college experience was learning to work under a much more hands-off system of teaching.
“In India, the teachers really prod you to do well, and they’ll let you know if you aren’t doing well.... The professors here don’t really do that, and it’s more up to the students to make sure they learn the material,” he said. “It took some time getting used to, especially during my freshmen courses.”
While Mistry said that he is fortunate to come from a family that can pay out of pocket for his education overseas, not all international students have this luxury. So rather than pay out of pocket, sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Chin Yang from Singapore is instead participating in a scholarship program offered by his government. “[The government] is paying for my education and travel,” Yang said.
In exchange for the scholarship, the government requires a high level of academic performance from him. “I have to keep my GPA above a 3.75... and my scholarship requires that I complete a master’s degree in computer science in four years. It means I need to graduate in three [years],” Yang said. “I also have a six-year bond. After I graduate, I need to work for [the government] for six years.”
Like Mistry, Yang has not had much of a problem adapting to American culture. “I’m sure there are a lot of cultural differences, but I haven’t really noticed many of them,” Yang said. “I have an accent, so sometimes I have to repeat myself when talking to new people, but people who get to know me can understand me.”
According to Yang, the Singaporean students on campus are a particularly close-knit group.
“We all know each other because it’s such a small community, and most of us are under the same scholarship program,” he said. 
Yang said that he met up with his Singaporean friends almost every day during his first year. 
“There’s also the Singaporean Student Association on campus.... Most of us come to the meetings and events,” he said.
However, Yang said that Singaporeans never become very invested in cultural events and activities because of the level of academic performance they are expected to achieve.
Carnegie Mellon also hosts several foreign exchange students, including junior computer science major Syed Moosavi from Carnegie Mellon’s Qatar campus. 
“It’s a semester-long program where instead of taking courses at Qatar, we take our courses in Pittsburgh,” said Moosavi, who is originally from India. “The computer science department sends two to three students every year to Pittsburgh.”
Moosavi’s biggest challenges adapting to the U.S. involved just getting around the city. “I’ve had a problem definitely understanding how things work here; the bus system, groceries, buying a ticket,” Moosavi said. 
“[In Qatar], everything is centrally located in a big shopping complex,” he added.
However, Moosavi made a point of arriving in Pittsburgh during the summer so he could figure out these logistical issues before the semester started, and since then, he said he hasn’t run into any problems. 
“I have an accent, but people can understand me.... It’s been easy for me to meet new people, and everyone is nice,” he said.

When you order a hamburger from City Grill, pizza from Skibo Café, or pasta from The Exchange, do you know what’s in your food? The Tartan Food Tracker, a project currently in beta version, aims to help you find out.
Although work on Tartan Food Tracker is currently on hold, the beta version is available online. It lists nutritional information for food on campus. Next to each dish, the nutritional value is given in a variety of different formats, including “per bowl,” “per order,” and “per cup.”
Some students think the website, as it currently stands, is unclear. Kashish Mittal, a first-year electrical and computer engineering and computer science double major, posed some questions about the food: “What consists of a meal? How much is considered a bowl or an order?”
CulinArt does not combine nutritional information for foods that go into the same carton. So, for instance, the nutritional information for an order of chicken tikka masala at Taste of India does not include the naan or rice that generally accompanies the meal.
Sean Minahan, executive chef with CulinArt, explained why CulinArt lists food the way it does. “Every dish is not going to be the same,” he said. “If you’re dining on campus, like at Pasta Villaggio, where the food is rich, we’re not going to limit what you can and can’t have, and let you make that decision on what’s best for you.”
On food containers bought in a grocery store, nutritional information is listed in servings, but in parentheses there is a measurement of weight that explains just how much counts as one serving. Although Tartan Food Tracker does not list a serving’s weight, Minahan said CulinArt ensures servings are properly and evenly portioned.
“I’m not sure what it is, but a cup is by liquefied volume, liquid weighted ounces,” Minahan said. “The analysis we provided for Tartan Tracker was based on portion size of the protein or whatever food it is, and we measured it in terms of the caloric volume. Measurements for an ‘order’ will be different for different locations. Pasta Villaggio, Spinning Salads, all those are given measurements. With regards to protein, we pre-portion in bags. We also have a cutting team with a butcher shop that portion meat for grilling.”
Paula Martin, a registered dietitian with University Health Services, said, “[Tartan] Food Tracker is currently on hold, and it’s not a finished product and is being tested. Right now, we have launched food icons, and some vendors are putting them on vendor boards and some are not. You can find nutritional information using the food icons described on the Housing and Dining site.”
The icons include “Whole Grain,” “Healthful Choice,” “Heart Smart,” “Vegetarian,” and “Vegan,” and give general information about food on menus. Not all campus dining locations, however, use the icons.
Mittal also posed another concern: “Why can’t each dining location clarify which foods are vegetarian or not, and give a description of each? Someone not from here surely would be confused with some options here.” 
While some places, like the Carnegie Mellon Café, list what is in different foods, other places like Skibo Café and Schatz Dining Room do not.
Minahan said CulinArt could do better on that front. 
“We do have identifier cards for many places, but at places like Schatz, there may not be total clarity, and sometimes we do miss it,” Minahan said. "It’s something that we’re working on every day.”
Other students have concerns about the availability of food. On weekends, when dining locations in the University Center are closed, some feel that food and drink options are limited. 
“We have to spend a good amount of money on food that probably isn’t the healthiest. Besides water, there are no healthy options to drink,” said Joetsaroop Bagga, a first-year biomedical engineering and chemical engineering double major.
Martin refutes this claim. “Our locations are all pretty unique, and we have a system in place in which access to food is broad,” she said. “I’ve been here for seven years, and I’m quite pleased with the food offerings. We’ve looked at health standards and offerings, so we look at access, variety, food safety concerns.” There are healthy options at dining locations, other than sweet or carbonated drinks: The Carnegie Mellon Café, for instance, offers milk, orange juice, and bottled water.
If students have concerns, Minahan said there is a “dining service group that acts together on a monthly basis, with vendors and groups, so if people have concerns, that’s a great place. There are also chefs and managers with our vending locations, so if a student has a concern, they should go to them.”

While Chinese and Japanese dining choices have made their way into campus eateries, the spicy, aromatic charms of kebabs, döner, and other Middle Eastern fare cannot easily be found in or around Carnegie Mellon. Taza 21 — a small, welcoming Middle Eastern restaurant in Squirrel Hill — proves to be capable of satisfying any desires for this sort of food, while only being a short trip away on any 61 bus.
While "Taza" means "fresh" in Arabic, one would more easily imagine it to mean "home" or "friendly dwelling." Upon first entering Taza 21, you are warmly greeted by the owners, who are husband and wife, briskly working in the visible kitchen located in the front of the restaurant. A small glass display case holds snacks like hummus, stuffed grape leaves, and tabbouleh — a tangy salad made of quinoa-like grains, parsley, tomatoes, onion, and an abundant amount of lemon juice.
Other choices hang on the wall in an almost overwhelmingly long menu, offering classic wraps like shawarma and falafel, but also more exotic ones, displaying intriguing names such as mujaddara and makloubeh.
The owners of Taza 21 seem to be genuinely concerned with each client’s comfort and satisfaction. It is not uncommon to be asked if you want some more while finishing off the last bits of a wrap or its accompanying yogurt-cucumber sauce. A late-night visit may even reward you with a few pieces of homemade beef pie, “because [they're] closing anyway.”
The food in itself perfectly reflects the attention that Taza 21's owners are so willing to provide to clients. Slightly toasted wraps boast fresh produce, well-paired flavors, and satisfying portions. The chicken shawarma wrap (also available with lamb meat) consists of smoky, grilled chunks of chicken, a creamy hummus sauce, tomato, parsley, and sour pickles to cut through the sauce’s consistency.
The only criticism that could be made is that it doesn't stick to traditional techniques. Shawarma is typically characterized by paper-thin shavings of lamb, beef or chicken meat rotating on a vertical spit, stuffed either into pita bread or wrapped in flatbread with onions, tomatoes, and other components — but these may vary according to the country of origin. The shawarma at Taza 21, however, contained chicken in chunks, even though it came from a spit. While not conforming to tradition, this technical problem did not affect the overall flavor of the wrap. 
The vegetarian choices are just as satisfying. The mujaddara, a smooth mixture of lentils, rice, and sautéed onions, is stuffed in a toasted flatbread with crunchy shreds of lettuce and chunks of tomato. Indeed, vegetarian options such as the mujaddara and falafel provide vegetarian diners with an experience as satisfying as that of a classic shawarma.
While not exactly in walking distance, Taza 21 has everything needed to provide students with an enjoyable dining experience. While its Middle Eastern fare seems to come from a place far away, the warmth and welcoming attitude of the restaurant’s owners make customers feel at home once again, wherever that home may be.
Taza 21 is located at 1821 Murray Avenue.

School of Art unveils new queer-themed program
Trans-Q Television, an online video variety show sponsored by the School of Art, and the Center for Arts in Society, is set to premiere Friday.
The premiere, which will take place at 6119 Penn Avenue, will include a dance party attended by members of Pittsburgh’s queer arts and music community. Doors will open at 8:30 p.m., and the episode screening is set to begin at 9 p.m. The free event is open to people over 18 years old.
Trans-Q is described in a university press release by executive producer and Carnegie Mellon art professor Suzie Silver as “a Dadaist variety show for the 21st century, or a truly warped fusion of Lawrence Welk, Sonny and Cher, Andy Warhol’s TV, Ernie Kovacs, Flip Wilson, Carol Burnett and Wigstock.”
Silver also said Trans-Q Television’s goal is to offer a series that highlights queer and transgender issues and themes. According to a university press release, the first episode is to have an appearance from drag queen Alaska Thunderfuck as well as highlights from hip-hop producer Le1f’s recent performance at the VIA Festival, an all-transgender/drag soap opera, and a student fashion show in artist Scott Andrew’s MAKESHOP residency at the Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh.
Andrew, a Carnegie Mellon master’s student in art, is producing the show, which will launch its first six-episode season in January.
Physics professor awarded the Condensed Matter Prize
Luc Berger, professor emeritus of physics, has been announced as a winner of the 2013 Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize by the American Physical Society.
The Oliver E. Buckley prize was established by Bell Labs and first endowed in 1952. The prize is awarded for an important contribution to the advancement of knowledge in condensed-matter physics.
Berger co-won the prize with John Slonczewski, an IBM research staff emeritus. Their theory was that a spin-polarized current can influence the relative orientation of the magnetic moment, which will cause the orientation of the moments to switch. This can be used to flip active elements in magnetic random access memory.
This flipping could make magnetic random access memory devices possible. These devices would be able to store greater amounts of data that may be accessed at faster speeds while consuming less battery power.
Fred Gilman, dean of the Mellon College of Science, said in a university press release, “The Buckley Prize is one of the most prestigious prizes awarded in the field of physics, and Luc is richly deserving of this honor.”
Berger and Slonczewski will receive the award in March at an American Physical Society meeting in Baltimore.

Hostess — the company behind such snacks as Twinkies, Ho Hos, Sno Balls, and Wonderbread — declared bankruptcy last Friday. Hostess had financial difficulties, which were then exacerbated by labor disputes with unions over pay. But some of Hostess’ products may return after these brands are brought up for auction. Here are some facts about the company and its products:
500 million: The number of Twinkies produced per year.
33: The number of bakeries operated by Hostess in the U.S.
150: The number of calories in a single Twinkie.
18,500: The number of workers being laid off as a result of the bankruptcy.

Although Carnegie Mellon students were probably impressed by the amazing quality of the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic chalk drawings they saw around campus in the past weeks, they might have scratched their heads, wondering what about this show for little girls motivates adults in college to create such elaborate fan art.
My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is a television series owned by toy company Hasbro that follows the unicorn Twilight Sparkle as she learns about friendship in the town of Ponyville. The show, based off Hasbro’s My Little Pony toy line, is currently in its third season. Although the show’s target demographic is little girls, during its first season it quickly built up a large internet fan base of adult males, who call themselves “bronies.”
What’s notable about bronies is not that they like a kid’s show, but rather the community they’ve constructed. There’s nothing unusual about adults enjoying great animation, humor, and music. However, while My Little Pony is enjoyable for all ages, it’s nothing so spectacular as to warrant such an active online community.
Rather, the brony community forms around the My Little Pony meme, which is a separate phenomenon from the show. In particular, pieces of brony fan art, unaffiliated with Hasbro or the show, become flags for bronies to rally around. The chalk drawing in particular is a good example because not only is it something to be proud of, but the collaborative nature of its creation also provides a reason for fans of the show to get together.
Viewership statistics on sites like YouTube confirm that bronies are more interested in fan-made content than they are in the show’s official spin-off content. For example, the Official My Little Pony YouTube Channel, started well before the series premiered in 2010, has 11,000 subscribers and 2 million views. It plays trailers, toy commercials, episode highlights, and behind-the-scenes features. The brony artist MandoPony’s channel started last year, well after the series premiere,  and it has 31,000 subscribers, 4 million views, and plays fan music based on the show.
But even for a meme, the My Little Pony meme is unusual in its longevity and quality. Most memes only achieve such a high level of popularity for a couple of weeks before fading, and even then, fan art is typically limited to image macros and GIFs. The My Little Pony meme’s popularity stems from the fact that it’s based off a weekly show instead of a single video clip or image.
I believe the sophisticated level of artwork is much more for the survival of the meme than for celebrating the show. As I mentioned earlier, fan art defines the brony community and holds it together, but this is because bronies can’t rally around the show alone. Ever since the adult fan base began, bronies have been ridiculed for liking a show for little girls, and this ridicule has grown along with the fan base.
As much as they would like to ignore the criticism, bronies are still sensitive to this ridicule, as any normal human would be. Many fans fear that acknowledging an affection for the show, even online under an anonymous username, is like coming out of the closet.
However, acknowledging a liking for the show’s fan art seems like a safer alternative to openly watching the show itself, since any ridicule about bronies will likely be coupled with praise for the fan art. The art is a source of pride to counterbalance any shame associated with the show. Without such artwork, the My Little Pony meme would probably lose much of its viral nature, jeopardizing its survival.
The My Little Pony meme is unlikely to end any time soon. There are still 10 episodes of the show’s third season left to broadcast, and even if the show is not renewed for a fourth season, these episodes will provide inspiration for brony artists for months to come.

Uganda is poised to pass a new anti-gay law by the end of the year as a “Christmas gift,” said speaker of the Ugandan parliament Rebecca Kadaga, according to BBC. Such laws are already on the books in Uganda and many African countries, making it illegal to engage in “homosexual activity.”
The new bill originally proposed that the death penalty be implemented as punishment for acts defined as “aggravated” homosexuality, where one of those involved is HIV-positive, a minor, disabled, or a repeat offender. 
Certain circumstances still merit life in prison, however, and even the promotion of gay rights will be prohibited under this bill. Some international groups have said they will stop sending donations until Ugandan officials acknowledge such rights.
It almost goes without saying that the vast majority of us living in the U.S., even those that might oppose same-sex marriage, are against such horrendous treatment. Yet is it justification for suspending aid? 
According to The New York Times, the U.S. still sends North Korea vast amounts of food just to keep the starving and impoverished population alive, despite the fact that the Kim family has been turning North Korean citizens against the West for over 50 years. Our government continues to condemn said actions and seeks an open dialogue, while aware that its words fall on deaf ears.
Two wrongs don’t make a right. When we stop sending aid, not only are we hurting those that put this law into place, but we’re also hurting even further those affected by it. 
We should instead be offering assistance to gay people in Uganda while simultaneously attempting to educate those who support such medieval and draconian laws. Help should not be given with strings attached. Even if we were somehow indirectly financing politicians and groups opposed to gay rights, this would not obligate us to cut off assistance across the board.
It is difficult for me to believe that, in this day and age, there are so many people still against equal rights for all, especially people who were once oppressed themselves. Then again, it is just as difficult to accept that there are millions worldwide stuck in poverty, sickness, and hunger when there are others who have their needs met in excess.
To quote Thomas Paine, “The World is my country, all mankind are my brethren, and to do good is my religion.” If more people could be convinced of this, the problems in Uganda might largely be abated. Convincing people is the real challenge.

After going through an atheist and an agnostic phase, I strongly believe in God. I don’t believe in a religious God, nor an anthropomorphic bearded white dude, but the kind of God who got bored one day, snapped his fingers, created the universe and then sat back with a piña colada to watch it unfold.
Religion is a deeply personal matter. Getting to the nexus of how you answer life’s mysteries is one of the most rewarding of life’s journeys. My beliefs have always come under fire in conversations I have with atheists, but these conversations, along with others’ stories of acceptance and rejection of religion, God, and spirituality, have all helped me reach my conclusions about a higher power.
I was raised Catholic and hated every second of it. Mass was annoying and completely inaccessible. Similarly, Confraternity of Christian Doctrine (CCD), an after-school Catholic education program that leeched every Wednesday afternoon of my elementary-school years, was something I dreaded more than brussels sprouts.
Yet every Sunday, my family dragged me to church, and every Wednesday I found myself at our local Catholic school for CCD until I was confirmed.
Despite not fully understanding my religion, I was a Catholic. I believed in Christ, communion, miracles, and sacraments. I also believed that, in time, I would understand and appreciate the arcane inner workings of my faith that eluded me. Shortly after being confirmed, however, two things happened that changed my perspective.
First, my family stopped going to church in the wake of a sexual abuse case that occurred in our diocese. At 12 years old, I was a bit too young and sheltered to fully understand how horrific these events were; it was the lack of weekly exposure that gradually distanced me from a faith I was not fully invested in.
Second, I stumbled upon a letter from my father to my grandmother. In it, he detailed some of the very same questions about the Catholic church that I was struggling with. He couldn’t identify with sermons, and he was struggling to access his own personal relationship with Jesus.
This, combined with my recent discovery of the cold hard truth about Santa Claus, dealt the Catholic Church a lethal blow. I thought that I was just too young to understand what church was all about. I was told that eventually the esoterica would be unlocked, and I’d get as much out of the church as I’d put in over the years. 
I thought time and maturity were all that stood in the way between me and a fulfilling religious experience. I thought wrong. The Roman Catholic Emperor had no clothes on, and with increasing faith in science, I became an atheist for a number of years.
What brought me back to God was Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). One of my extended family members is a recovering alcoholic who has achieved 27 years of sobriety. Out of a desire to share his experiences with me, he’s taken me to a few meetings. While not a religious program, AA does require you to accept a higher power. A typical meeting will involve welcoming new members, recognition of sobriety anniversaries, and group prayer — and typically people will share the story of how they achieved sobriety and what keeps them sober. Some of the stories are absolutely incredible and miraculous.
The most memorable story was about a man who, on his 24th birthday, hit rock bottom. Having alienated friends and family, he locked himself in a room with a gun and bottle of vodka vowing that, come morning, either he would come out with the unopened bottle or he wouldn’t come out at all. He made it through the night without drinking, and in the morning, he checked himself into rehab. He went on to lead a very fulfilling life and died in his 80s surrounded by friends and family.
After hearing many stories, what struck me most was how it became easier for people to stop drinking once they accepted a higher power. Remarkably, everyone’s interpretation of a higher power was different. One woman thought of God as an acronym for “Good Orderly Direction,” representing the notion of putting yourself on a path and doing the next right thing to achieve not just sobriety, but any goal. God, to her, was the objective sense of what the next right thing was. After accepting this, she found it easier to stop drinking.
These stories inspired me to search for my own higher power, which I initially found in music and in a collective human energy toward positivity. Both had the ability to make me feel a uniquely positive set of emotions that inspired me to be a better person and do better things. 
Combined with a new analysis of the seemingly miraculous fact of free will, these stories helped me start to believe in God, a process that finished after learning about just how well suited Earth is for human habitation. It seems almost too good to be true. While we definitely evolved to adapt to our ridiculously optimal conditions, it’s easier for me to believe that this was set into motion by some higher power, rather than arrived at by chance.
I know none of this can be proven as objectively true, but to me spirituality isn’t about being right. I’ve found spirituality to be about enriching my life and finding purpose and inspiration to help guide me. We’ll never know for sure exactly what set the big bang into motion or why we’re here. 
I think it’s a mistake to write off belief in a higher power just because you believe that Genesis is wrong about creation or if you are disillusioned with organized religion. I fall into both of those categories, and I still find a substantial benefit from a belief in God.
I’ve come to realize that my set of beliefs works for me and won’t work for everyone else. These are the conclusions that I’ve come to and they enrich my life every day. 
Spirituality has humbled and inspired me to take joy in little things and be truly grateful for everything that I have. I hope that everyone can be inspired to feel this way through whatever force moves them, whether it’s spiritual or not, but if you haven’t found your own higher power, by no means should you stop searching.

Residents in over 30 states have filed online petitions last week to secede from the U.S. Most of these states are red states, but petitions have also been created for California, New York, and New Jersey.
The White House website has a section called “We the People,” through which citizens can submit their own petitions to the President.
These petitions are then reviewed by the administration if they receive 25,000 signatures in 30 days. Many of the petitions reached the 25,000 threshold within days of being created. The petition for Texas to secede has already accrued over 113,000 signatures, and the petition for Louisiana's secession has gained over 36,000 signatures.
Obviously, the signers of the petitions have not clearly thought out the implications of secession and the creation of a new country. The existing infrastructure in the U.S. does not accommodate several separate countries — think about the highways, the banking system, and the postal service.
Would these new country-states each have their own currency? What about all of the citizens that rely on federal aid, like the poor, the sick, and the elderly — would they still be covered? Could a state-turned-country quickly and efficiently resolve natural disasters? What about national security and defense? If a state were to actually secede, it’s likely that many of the state’s finances and bureaucratic structures would be thrown into complete disarray.
So given these logistical questions, the people that are threatening to secede from the Union come off as eight-year-olds threatening to run away from home.
But for a moment, let’s put aside the question of whether the states can actually secede, and ask whether or not they should.
It’s very tempting to say yes to secession. The petitions, all of which were filed a few days after Election Day, reflect a sense of civic immaturity and smug self-centeredness on the part of their signers. “I am proud to be an American, as long as I always get my way on every issue ever,” is not exactly the most patriotic statement you can make.
Elections may not always go your way, but sometimes we have to accept that fact as members of a democratic society. There will always be other elections, both on the federal and state levels, as well as other avenues to make your voice heard in government. Secession, or irrevocably cutting the ties between your state and the Union, should only be reserved for the most drastic situations in which there are no viable democratic ways to reform government.
As a nation, we’ve come a long way after two centuries. Politics may be bitter at the moment, but they have been much worse. We’ve gone through two World Wars, suffered countless national disasters, had 43 presidents, and witnessed a myriad of social and political movements throughout the years. Proposing secession after a single election that doesn’t go your way is like divorcing someone you’ve been married to for 40 years over a bad casserole dish.
Thankfully, the respective governments of the petition-filing states don’t seem to be taking the case for secession too seriously, so the possibility of another civil war is small. Still, it’s somewhat demoralizing to see that there are some people in America who would rather see the break-up of the U.S. than see their preferred candidate lose. But then again, that’s democracy: Even the worst ideas have to be heard at some point.

Students were delighted to find the Bat Signal shining on the side of the Purnell Center for the Arts last Wednesday and Thursday nights, signaling the beginning of AB Films’ Batman week.
In addition to everyone’s Facebook News Feeds exploding, the sudden appearance of the Bat Signal illuminated the evening of many students working hard on their assignments due before Thanksgiving break.
AB Films showed all three movies of Christopher Nolan’s brilliant The Dark Knight trilogy, followed by a Batman-themed TBA on Sunday.
With students’ notoriously heavy workload bearing down on them before Thanksgiving break, the Batman-related events were a breath of fresh air. Similar to AB Special Event’s petting zoo last month, the Bat Signal and general Batman fanfare last week helped lighten the campus mood and reminded us that Carnegie Mellon is a special place.
The Bat Signal also reminded students of our own relationship to the Nolan franchise: Much of the the third film, The Dark Knight Rises, was filmed in Pittsburgh, with the climactic fight scene filmed on campus at the Mellon Institute.
On top of this, it can clearly be seen that Batman is the right superhero for Carnegie Mellon. He makes use of powerful, futuristic technology, survives on little to no sleep, and drives himself past his breaking points to do what needs to be done.
The Activities Board did an excellent job with Batman week, allowing students to see some of the best superhero movies made in recent memory and using such a creative promotion technique. It’s the little things like the Bat Signal that make life on campus dynamic and keep Carnegie Mellon interesting.
Congratulations to the Activities Board for supplying and promoting Batman week and for providing the inspiration we need and deserve.

Thanksgiving break provides the perfect opportunity to reflect upon the semester thus far and figure out what we’re thankful for from the past semester. We want to commend student government for the work it has done so far this year.
Student Senate has been far more visible on campus this semester than in recent years. During Student Senate Week, Senate not only raised awareness by giving out plenty of free food and Student Senate gear, but it also pushed students to connect with their Senators and to make suggestions on how Senate could improve through email correspondence and tabling. 
The level of activity on Senate’s Facebook page and the banner on the front of Doherty Hall, advertising Senate’s weekly open meetings, is further evidence of the better attempts Senate has made this year to reach out to its constituents.
The executive branch has also been far more visible and active than in previous years. Student Body President Will Weiner and Vice President Meela Dudley have made their presence known through town hall meetings, events for the national election, and their frequently updated Facebook page — a clear improvement over the silence of last year’s president and vice president.
Student Body Vice President for Finance Jon Mark has also been proactive in his attempt to better serve student organizations through his referendum for a raise in the student activities fee. Although the referendum vote had a disappointingly low turnout — only 18.11 percent of undergraduate students voted — it wasn’t for lack of effort on student government’s part: Mark held two town hall meetings on the fee raise, and there were signs up around campus urging people to vote in “The second most important election of the month.”
The Graduate Student Assembly has always been a strong, positive presence on campus, and this semester was no exception: The new bicycle racks and maintenance centers that it had installed around campus will serve members of the campus community for years to come.
We are glad to see that every branch of student government appears to be taking its duties seriously this year, and we hope to see even more action from them next semester.

Remember when you moved off campus into a cheap apartment, only to find that the landlord didn’t take care of your residence? Yeah, we do too — but Pittsburgh councilman Bill Peduto has plans for these neglectful property owners. He wants to introduce legislation that would expose the 10 worst landlords in Pittsburgh: Pittsburgh Public Works would post their names and phone numbers in front of their buildings, encouraging neighbors and passerby to call and complain.
This shaming tactic might seem a bit dubious at first glance. It may make these 10 landlords clean up their acts, and thus could really improve Pittsburgh living. But would it foster discontent between the property owners and their tenants?
If this legislation makes tenants and neighbors speak up about their despicable living situations, then great: The conflict should help to improve living conditions for residents. Besides, this concept is hardly unprecedented. 
Many other U.S. cities have similar if not identical policies, and Pittsburgh used it back in the ’90s to take out five “nuisance properties.” Why not bring back a policy that worked well in the past? Most people care about their job reputations, and being labeled as one of the 10 worst landlords in Pittsburgh can’t be good for business.
The last thing that college students are looking for when they move into their own place is a negligent landlord. Students might not know right away how to work out payments or what exact charges they’ll find on their utilities bills. The least they can ask for is a landlord who will be there to answer these questions — one willing to respond (even grudgingly) to the complaints of tenants, students, or others.
Housing prices in Pittsburgh are low compared to those in other U.S. cities — go check out San Francisco’s rental rates to appreciate Pittsburgh even more — and Carnegie Mellon students can leave campus housing as early as their sophomore year. This may contribute to the fact that about 39 percent of undergraduates live off campus, according to U.S. News and World Report. 
Measures like Peduto’s proposed legislation will make this transition from college dorm to rented residence smoother for a number of students.
