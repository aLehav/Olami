After the Western Conference finals, four teams remain in contention to win the strangest season of basketball that we’ve ever seen: the Boston Celtics, Miami Heat, LA Lakers, and the Denver Nuggets.
Those who may not be following the playoffs might be saying, “What about the Bucks? Aren’t they, like, really good?” Yes, they are good — the best team in the 2019-2020 regular season, in fact, led by superstar and MVP favorite Giannis Antetoukunmpo. However, the Bucks proved to be no match for the blazing hot Jimmy Butler and the Heat, stacked with young talent. The Heat put away the Bucks in 5 games, bringing their total losses in the playoffs to a grand total of one. The game they did lose, mind you, was a hotly contested three point contest in overtime. 
To be fair to Milwaukee, all of the games were only won by roughly ten points or less, but it didn’t feel that way. Miami controlled the series from the start with Butler ripping through the Bucks’ league-best defense for 40 points and Goran Dragic adding 27 himself. The “Greek Freak” was held to just 18 points, but he also missed more than half of the first half due to foul trouble. The Bucks were also missing defensive stud Eric Bledsoe, so it’s safe to say not all hope was lost. 
It was the next game when the concern set in. Giannis seemed to come back to life, dropping 29 points with 14 rebounds, but he also committed a fatal foul at the end of a tie game that sent Butler to the line for two game winning free throws. This followed a three-point foul on Khris Middleton that tightened the game up. It was close, but the Heat pulled through and put the Bucks in a dire 0-2 position. 
Still, though, an 0-2 comeback has been seen before. As for an 0-3, the same doesn’t hold true. That is the situation that Milwaukee found themselves in after the Heat rallied in the fourth quarter from a 12 point deficit win by what ended up to be the largest point differential in the series, outscoring the Bucks 35-9! in the final ten minutes. After the game, Giannis [called]((https://www.nba.com/article/2020/09/05/bucks-heat-record-fourth-quarter-pushes-brink) a spade a spade: “They [played] harder than us.”
While the Bucks were able to squeak out a close win in Game 4
and avoid the sweep, the series was all but over. The silver lining was Khris Middleton, who scored 36 in the fourth game and single handedly won them the game after Giannis was injured. Middleton continues to be a rising star, with his highest career point average this season. With Giannis out again, the Heat were able to seal the deal in Game 5.
Elsewhere in the East, in a much less one-sided series, the Celtics overcame the Raptors in an exhausting, but exciting, 7 game contest. It didn’t start like a 7 game series, however, and was one three-pointer away from being exactly the opposite. Boston took Game 1 easily, exerting control on both sides of the ball. They were able to stifle Toronto’s efficient transition offense, and the Raptors left gaps in their defense that Boston was able to take advantage of, especially from the corner-three, where they have been very efficient this season. 
Game 2 was closer with Toronto being better prepared, but no team could have been prepared for the 3-point barrage that Marcus Smart released in the fourth quarter, hitting five three’s and a free throw for a total of 16 points. Kemba Walker built on Smart’s momentum hitting a pair of clutch shots to propel the team past Toronto in the final minutes. All the while, Celtics’ young star Jayson Tatum continues to shine more brightly by improving his playmaking. 
It was Game 3 that shook the series up, and it was anyone’s game down to the last seconds. Toronto was able to save their season when a perfect inbound pass from Kyle Lowry to OG Anunoby led to a game-winning three-pointer with 0.5 seconds on the clock. The ending encapsulated the game, which was a tight one with numerous lead changes. Lowry also contributed 31 points, while Kemba Walker dropped 30. 
Each team won two games of the next four, but each win was not created equal. The Celtics blew out the Raptors 111-89 in Game 5, and it was never close from start to finish. And of course, the Celtics won the one that mattered most, Game 7. Game 6 was possibly the most exciting of the series, a  2 OT thriller ending in a flurry of amazing shots and 33 total points from Lowry in a 125-122 Raptors win. In the end, though, it was the Celtics defense that gave them the edge to win the final game.
Over in the West, the Lakers put away the Rockets five games in another lopsided series. Houston took the first game, starting strong and fast, putting up a stellar defense, and holding Lakers stars LeBron James and Anthony Davis to just 22 points in the second half. On the Laker side, they committed numerous fouls, fouling James Harden 11 times alone. After the game, LeBron remarked on Houston’s speed on both sides of the ball and admitted that his team wasn’t ready for it. They certainly adjusted, however, because the Rockets didn’t win another game in the series. 
James and Davis bounced back in Game 2, combining for 64 points, 21 rebounds, and 13 assists with James nearly achieving a triple-double. Veteran guard Rajon Rondo also contributed, showing signs of a break out. For Houston, star Russell Westbrook struggled on offense, and their bench gave them virtually no help, unlike the Lakers. 
Rondo maintained his momentum into Game 3, leading a fourth quarter surge that pushed the Lakers ahead, while also scoring 21 and dishing nine assists. James remained stellar, with 29 points in the first half, 36 total, and a lockdown defense. Harden nearly had a triple-double, but it wasn’t enough. 
The Lakers cemented their dominance in Game 4 led by Davis’ 29 points, in a 110-100 win in which they got a lead early and kept it, at one point stretching the lead to 20 points. Westbrook resurfaced to score 25 and Harden dropped a solid 21, but neither contributed many assists or rebounds leaving the former MVPs in an all too familiar spot. 
The Lakers drove the nail in the coffin with a 119-96 blowout, leading Game 5 by as much as 30 at one point.
In another upset, the Nuggets came back from a 3-1 series deficit to beat the Clippers. The Clippers dominated in Game 1 with a 120-97 win, being fully healthy for the first time in a while. They got back the hyper energetic defensive leader Patrick Beverly, who provided a boost for the team, as did the return of forward Marcus Morris. Stars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George were in sync, as was all-star sixth man Lou Williams. The Nuggets simply lacked energy after recovering from a long 7 game series against the Jazz. 
The Nuggets regained their energy for Game 2, however, as they burst out with 44 points in the first quarter to jump to an early 23 point lead. This was enough to keep the Nuggets ahead for the game, and they were able to hold on when it got close with big three point shots from defensive star Gary Harris. The Nuggets also put up a fantastic defensive performance behind Harris, Leonard, and George, to overcome a lack of scoring from them. The Nuggets’ stars Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokic posted solid numbers, but they lacked energy. 
Game 3 tipped the series back to LA behind Paul George’s stellar play on both sides of the ball, dropping 32 points and locking down Murray. Leonard added another 23 points and 14 rebounds. The Clips tacked on yet another win in Game 4 leading from start to finish, although Denver kept it close. Leonard put up 30 points and cracked down on defense in the second half with four steals. The rest of the team followed suit on defense. 
Game 5 is where the series got interesting. The Nuggets rallied in the second half for a comeback to win 111-105. While Murray and Jokic combined for 48 points, it was help from elsewhere on the roster that pushed them past LA in the end. Veteran Paul Millsap dropped 14 points in the second half, and rookie Michael Porter Jr. helped seal the deal in the final minutes. The energy was similar to when the team crawled back from the same 3-1 deficit in the previous series. 
Game 6 had a similar storyline with the Nuggets coming from behind after trailing by 19 points in the third quarter for a 111-98 win. Clutch shots came from all over their lineup, and they collectively played astute defense, with 11 stops in the second half. The team found themselves down yet again in Game 7, but were miraculously able to rally behind Jamal Murray’s 40 point performance to make a historic series comeback.
In the semi-finals, the Celtics will play the Heat, while the Nuggets face Lebron James and the Lakers.

Seven months ago, America watched Patrick Mahomes, Andy Reid, and the Kansas City Chiefs hoist the Lombardi Trophy in Miami. During this long wait, we have watched the world around us fundamentally change as the COVID-19 pandemic has redefined life as we know it. For months, the NFL season in the fall of 2020 hung in the balance like most other things in life. However, we made it to the end of the tunnel. The NFL season has commenced, bringing a sense of the old “normal,” even though the league is operating in a vastly different environment from 2019 (very few fans and masks a-plenty just to name a few changes).
With the first week of games over, here are my observations for each team from an unprecedented Week 1 of the 2020 NFL season.
Houston Texans @ Kansas City Chiefs 
Score: 34-20 Chiefs
The defending champions didn’t lose a step in the opener. In fact, the Chiefs looked even more lethal on the offensive side of the ball than they did in February. Rookie running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire stole the show in his debut with 138 yards and a crisp 27 yard touchdown run. While Patrick Mahomes had a quiet game statistically, only throwing for 211 yards, the $500-million QB precisely picked apart the Texans defense adding a new skill to his already impressive arm talent. 
In their first game without star receiver DeAndre Hopkins, the Texans offense was completely outmatched by an underrated Kansas City defense. In addition, a lack of a clear gameplan by head coach Bill O’Brien led DeShaun Watson to fend for himself at the Arrowhead on Thursday Night. The results: not good. The Texans better find a way to quickly implement new additions like Randall Cobb & David Johnson into the playbook, or the Texans will be on the couch in January.
New York Jets @ Buffalo Bills 
Score: 27-17 Bills
With the eternal Brady-Belichick dynasty dismantled, the Buffalo Bills seemed poised to take over the AFC East crown. They started on the right foot with a complete game against a rather easy New York Jets team at home. The core of the Bills, the defense, showed why they are still a top 5 defensive unit, since they rattled Sam Darnold and the Jets offense all day. While imperfect, the Bills offense put on a well-rounded performance led by solid air and ground from QB Josh Allen who had 312 passing yards and 57 rush yards. It’ll be interesting to see if the Bills can maintain this consistent style of play against tougher opponents.
17 points is a very generous point total for the New York Jets who looked completely unprepared in Sunday’s match. The score does not do justice to the fact that the Jets looked completely overwhelmed in Buffalo, giving up nearly 400 yards of offense and 3 touchdowns to a rather average Josh Allen. However, the elephant in the room has to be the Jets offense, which played a horrendous game on Sunday. Sam Darnold and Adam Gase do not work together, period. If this performance continues, Joe Douglas and the Jets management will be getting rid of one of them at the end of the season or earlier. 
Green Bay Packers @ Minnesota Vikings 
Score: 43-34 Packers
Jordan Love who? The Packers offensive masterpiece and win is because of Aaron Rodgers’ performance. Throwing for 364 yards and 4 touchdown passes, Aaron Rodgers reminded the Vikings defense and the league that he is still a top-tier NFL QB. There was not a throw that Rodgers could not complete on Sunday. The short quick slants and the long verticals were his for the taking. Also, how about DeVante Adams? 156 receiving yards and 2 TD’s. Wish I did not have to play against him in fantasy this week. It's a good start for the Packers, but can they keep it up for 16 games?
An atypical showing from Mike Zimmer and the Vikings defense on Sunday. A normally solid defense gave up the most in a Vikings home game in the Zimmer era. Even more strange, they held the Packers’ offense to just eight points through most of the first half before the Packers scored two TD’s in the final two minutes to take a 22-7 lead at the break. While the Vikings offense did manage to score 34 points, most of the scoring came in the final frame after falling behind 29-10, padding the stats. Kirk Cousins looked flat for three quarters, giving up a safety in the process. After a tough loss to a division rival, how will the Vikings’ rather subpar performance affect their confidence before their matchup with the Colts next week?
Philadelphia Eagles @ Washington Football Team 
Score: 27-17 Football Team
After a tumultuous offseason, the Washington Football Team looked like they would carry their dysfunction into the regular season, falling behind 17-0 to the Eagles at the half. However, give props to new head coach Ron Riveria and the Washington defense. They managed to turn around a rather hopeless affair into victory behind 8 sacks and 2 turnovers. While they have only played one game, the Washington Football Team looks like a much better team in terms of cohesion, especially on the defensive side of the ball. If the Football Team can continue to pressure opposing quarterbacks like they did on Sunday, Washington could be a surprise team in 2020. 
It seems like the Eagles forgot to fly offensive protection for Carson Wentz to FedEx Field on Sunday. The porous play of the offensive line was apparent the entire game, even when they had the lead in the first half. It felt like Carson Wentz was throwing the football milliseconds before the defenders would crash in on him. While he managed to escape them in the first half, the pass rush eventually forced Wentz to make some poor throws to Washington defenders. Philadelphia is a top-tier team and upsets do occur, but if the Eagles want to maximize the potential of their offense and their weapons like Zach Ertz and Jalen Reagor, they must protect Carson Wentz. Otherwise, they may not have anything to protect later in the season.
Cleveland Browns @ Baltimore Ravens
Score: 38-6 Ravens
It looks like the Ravens have not lost a step during the 2020 offseason. Lamar Jackson still looks like the dominant MVP QB from a year ago, in both his passing and running game. Furthermore, the Ravens weapons like Hollywood Brown and Mark Andrews added on to the 5-star showing from the offense with over a 100 yards and 2 touchdowns respectively. However, I can not forget the Ravens defense, which completely kept the Browns talent at bay on Sunday. The defense managed to play especially well in situational defense, stopping the Browns on multiple fourth downs. While only one week into the season, the Baltimore Ravens look as poised as ever to contend for a title in 2020. The question still remains if they can play like they did on Sunday come January and February.
New coach and uniforms, but the same result on Sunday for the Browns. They extended their annual winless streak during Week 1 to 16 games with a poor offensive showing. After an early touchdown pass in the 1st quarter to David Njoku, Baker Mayfeld disappeared from the rest of the game, contributing next to nothing on the offense. In addition, the Ravens defense neutralized Odell Beckham Jr., holding him to just 22 yards on 3 catches. Along with new head coach Kevin Stefanski’s offensive game plan failing, his defensive strategy was not much better, allowing the Ravens offense to find open targets in the secondary all day. The Browns think that they are out of rebuilding mode, but if Week 1 is an indication for the season, they may need to reenter it sooner than they would like.
Indianapolis Colts vs Jacksonville Jaguars
Score: 27-20 Jaguars
After being consistently called one of the worst teams in the NFL, the Jacksonville Jaguars silenced their doubters for at least a week with an impressive win over their division rival Colts in front of a crowd of 17,000 fans. Gardner Minshew led the way with one of the most efficient passing performances of the week, having only one incomplete pass on 20 attempts, along with 3 touchdown passes. Furthermore, Minshew spread the ball around the field with 10 players catching a ball from the Jaguars’ QB on Sunday. If Minshew can keep up this level of play, the Jaguars may not need to draft a quarterback in 2021.
Philip Rivers’ Colts debut was much like his games with the Chargers: lots of passing yards (363 yards on Sunday), but also lots of turnovers (two interceptions). It is clear Philip Rivers can throw the ball, given he is in the top 10 for career passing yards, but his constant achilles heel has been the turnovers. If he can get rid of this pesky problem, he has a lot of options with receivers like T.Y. Hilton and rookie Michael Pittman Jr. and running backs like rookie Johnathan Taylor and Nyheim Hines. On the defensive side of the ball, giving up three passing touchdown passes to one of the least consistent offenses cannot be a consistent theme for the Colts secondary. If they can clean up some of their mistakes, the Colts can easily erase this early season blunder and reach their potential with a division title for 2020.              
Las Vegas Raiders @ Carolina Panthers
Score: 34-30 Raiders
The Las Vegas Raiders (still feels weird saying) pulled off an impressive offense performance in their season opener. The easy choice for MVP of this game was RB Josh Jacobs who ran for 93 yards and three TDS. Add in a solid performance from Derek Carr, and the Raiders crossed 30 points. Yet, their defense left something to be desired as they gave up 30 points to a new QB and rookie head coach, who haven’t had much practice or preseason to develop chemistry. If the Raiders are to contend, they must find a way to play defense at the same level as their offense consistently.
In the debut of the Teddy Bridgewater and Matt Rhule era in Carolina, the Panthers’ offense looked incredibly potent. They were helped by a great rushing and receiving performance from their franchise running back Christian McCaffery. However, the defense let them down. Without leaders like Luke Kuechly, the defense looked disorganized throughout the game, leading the Raiders to score easily. The Panthers need to find a defensive leader quickly or their offense will not be able to keep up with the other high score offenses in their division.
Chicago Bears at Detroit Lions
Score: 27-23 Bears
For three out of the four quarters, the Bears looked deplorable. However, in the final quarter, Mitch Trubisky’s wild performance ultimately led to a tough division win. In addition, players like Alan Robinson contributed to the fourth quarter with huge gains in the receiving department; not to mention the Bears defense dominated the Lions, especially in the second half, limiting them in points. While this comeback may be impressive for the time being, the Bears need to find a way to get a lead early on if they are expecting to return to the playoffs for the first time since 2018.
If any game signifies the Pat Patricia era with the Detroit Lions, it has to be this one game. They had the game in their hands and dropped it literally in the final seconds (looking at you DeAndre Swift). In the first three quarters, the Lions completely matched the Bears both on offense and defense. Matt Stafford looked good in his season debut before succumbing to a strong Bears defense in the final frame. Furthermore the Lions’ defense, who a year ago gave up the most in yards through the air, managed to completely shut down Mitch Tribsky’s aerial attack before breaking down in the fourth quarter. While only a game in, the Lions’ inability to finish games could be very costly at the end of the year as jobs could be lost if leads are not protected.
Seattle Seahawks @ Atlanta Falcons
Score: 38-25 Seahawks
On opening day, Russell Wilson had one of the most efficient games you may ever see. I know I said Gardener Minshew had a similar performance from earlier, but Wilson played at the same level of efficiency with a higher output throwing for four touchdowns and 300 yards, including a beautiful pass to DK Metcalf in the second quarter to help the Seahawks take a commanding lead. However the defense managed to still give up 450 passing yards to Matt Ryan and the Falcons’ offense. While it only resulted in 25 points squandered, the Falcons offense exposed the secondary in the Seahawks defense. If the Seattle Seahawks expect to win the NFC West, they must tighten up their pass defense or else they will end up getting burned by teams like the Cardinals, Niners, and Rams.
The Falcons’ performance on Sunday was too little, too late. Too little in the sense that the Falcons defense did not do enough to stop Russell Wilson and Seahawks passing consistently throughout the game. There was little pressure applied to Russell Wilson and the receivers had plenty of space to catch easy targets. The Falcons were also too late in the sense that their offense didn’t really get going until late in the game when they were already out of contention. If the Falcons have any hope of making the playoffs, they must stop their sluggish starts, or else they will be on the couch come January.
Miami Dolphins @ New England Patriots
Score: 21-11 Patriots
New QB, new uniforms, new era. However, the Patriots continued their winning ways on Sunday with an easy division win over the Miami Dolphins. In Cam Newton’s debut as a Patriot, he found a way to integrate his dynamic offense into Bill Belichick‘s rigid system. While the Patriots are combining opposite ways to play football, the chemistry seemed to work. In addition, the Patriots strong defense from a year ago continued on Sunday, forcing Ryan Fitzpatrick to turn over the ball multiple times throughout the affair. If the Patriots can keep up this well rounded performance, they can turn a lot of heads by continuing to make the playoffs, whether it be as a division leader or wildcard.
The Dolphins’ season debut was, quite frankly, ugly. Throughout the game, the defense had no answers for how to contain Cam Newton. Furthermore the offense struggled to muster more than a drive down the field for a touchdown. It is clear that Ryan Fitzpatrick is not the long-term answer at quarterback. He may not even be the short-term answer. All Dolphins fans better hope that Tua Tagovailova starts sooner than later, or else the season will very much be like last.
Los Angeles Chargers @ Cincinnati Bengals
Score: 16-13 Chargers
In their first game without Philip Rivers, the Chargers pulled out a gutsy win in Cincinnati. Led by Tyrod Taylor, the Chargers manage to muster enough points on offense to win. However, the story of the game for the Chargers was the defense. In particular, Casey Hayward played an awesome game, leading to him being chosen as defensive player of the week. While Joe Burrow was able to have his highlights, the Chargers mostly kept him contained throughout the game. With the Bengals being a relatively easy opponent, the Chargers will need to improve their offensive production, especially next week against the Chiefs if they are to contend for a playoff spot.
The Joe Burrow era in Cincinnati kicked off with a tough loss, but with a lot of promise. Throughout the game, Joe Burrow showed flashes of potential. He was not able to maintain a high level of play throughout the game, but when it mattered, he played extraordinarily well and looked more like a veteran. The defense was able to mostly contain a Chargers offense filled with weapons like Keenan Allen and Austin Ekeler. Unfortunately, a special teams error ruined a special performance from the Bengals. Still, there’s plenty of potential for this team to get better as the year goes.
Arizona Cardinals @ San Francisco 49ers
Score: 24-20 Cardinals
What a day from the young Cardinals team on Sunday! They played to their full potential. In fact, they probably exceeded many people's expectations. With the DeAndre Hopkins acquisition looking like it returned a strong return on Sunday with 14 receptions, Kyler Murray also showed significant improvements from a year ago in a run and pass game on Sunday. The defense also managed to shut down one of the most potent offenses in the league. During the game, they force the 49ers to make constant mistakes. If the Cardinals can keep this performance up, they may be having more than a 16-game season.
Well that sucked! 49ers fans must be stunned as they’ve managed to lose to the worst team in the division at home. Do we have a potential Super Bowl hangover in the air? Because the Niners were flat all day. Outside of an incredible play for Rahim Mostert, the Niners didn’t do too much on the offensive side of the ball; defensively, they had problems covering DeAndre Hopkins throughout the game. Also, they let Kyler Murray move around the pocket, playing to his strengths. While it's only one week, the Niners might want to start playing seriously as their opponents get tougher as the season progresses.
Tampa Bay Buccaneers @ New Orleans Saints
Score 34-23 Saints
In Tampa Tom’s debut, the Buccaneers offense struggled to protect the ball and move effectively down the field. Tom Brady struggled to connect with his receivers, and they seemed on different pages throughout the game. This lack of chemistry led to some pretty ugly throws and picks. However, this is to be expected with a shortened camp and no preseason. Defensively, they were not much better. Alvin Kamara had a field day on this defense, and Drew Brees never looked more comfortable. While the Bucs may need time to adjust, they will need to start quickly winning or else the chance of losing a playoff spot grows.
In an empty Superdome, the Saints played in the same way they would if 70,000 fans were in attendance: with high energy and intensity. The Saints’ offense continued to play at a high-level with all positions contributing to the win. This includes strong performances from running back Kamara, who had two touchdowns, and a strong passing performance from Brees. The defense managed to also contribute to the game, making Brady uncomfortable all game long and picking off the future Hall of Famer twice, including a pick six from corner Janoris Jenkins in the third quarter to give them a 24-7 lead. Even though many had doubts on whether the Saints could continue their strong play this season, Week 1 showed that they are still a contender for the Super Bowl this season.
Dallas Cowboys @ Los Angeles Rams
Score: 20-17 Rams
In their first game at SoFi stadium, the Rams christened their new palace with a strong win over a premier team in the Dallas Cowboys. While not perfect, the team managed to play a strong all-around game with a solid performance from Jared Goff on the offensive side of the football. Defensively, the Rams managed to shut down the Cowboys offense when it mattered the most. Jalen Ramsey in particular played an excellent game, forcing a critical fumble in the fourth quarter and sealing off Michael Gallup in the final stages to secure the win. If the Rams can clean up some of their mistakes, they could easily contend for the NFC West crown this year.
In a game plagued with ups and downs for the Dallas Cowboys, they were ultimately unable to pull out a victory. Dak Prescott was rather pedestrian during the game. During the third quarter, Prescott was able to drive the Cowboys down the field, but they failed to turn these drives into touchdowns, costing them the game. Furthermore, the play calling in the fourth quarter was too aggressive in the red zone, causing them to miss out on some easy points that could’ve given them a chance to go to overtime. Defensively, the Cowboys also played decently but never gave the offense a chance to start with a good field position to make McCarthy’s debut easy. The McCarthy Cowboys played much like the Jason Garett Cowboys; However it will be interesting to see how this relationship evolves over the season.
Pittsburgh Steelers at New York Giants
Score: 26-16 Steelers
Big Ben’s return to the field for the Steelers offense was good on Monday night. For the first time in a while, the veteran quarterback found his number one target, Juju Smith-Schuster, twice in the endzone. Furthermore, the defense played a strong game against the albeit relatively weak Giants offense, but they did manage to pick off Daniel Jones twice. More impressive, they held star running back Saquon Barkley to 0.4 yards a carry, effectively making him a non-factor for the game. The Steelers’ strong debut signals a positive sign for the season ahead if they can stay healthy.
In Joe Judge’s first game as head coach of the New York Giants, they played an incomplete football game. Offensively, the Giants never seemed in rhythm, as they got rid of the run quickly after a slow start from Saquon Barkley. Furthermore, the Giants made mistakes in the red zone, including an awful pick from Daniel Jones that seemed to change the tide of the game. Defensively they didn’t seem to have too much to answer for Juju Smith-Schuster. If the Giants are to build upon last year’s performance, they will need to play better on both sides of the ball.
Tennessee Titans at Denver Broncos
Score 16-14 Titans
In a sloppy week one closer, the Titans pulled out a two-point win over the Denver Broncos. It should’ve been a lot more than two points though as the Titans missed key opportunities throughout the game, not only by missing three field goals and an extra point from a bad Stephen Gostkowski performance, but also by missing opportunities to throw the ball. They over-relied on Derek Henry, handing the ball to him 31 times. Defensively, however, the Titans did their job, walking down a potentially explosive Broncos offense with a strong goal line stand. Going forward, Tennessee must trust their passing game if they are to return to the AFC championship like they did a year ago.
After a lot of speculation during the off-season, the Denver Broncos offense was a little below expectations on Sunday. No one in particular played horribly; however, there were missed opportunities and mistakes throughout the game. Jerry Jeudy dropped two passes in his debut. Melvin Gordon fumbled, helping Tennessee set up their first score. And Drew Lock was unable to connect with certain receivers throughout the game. Defensively, this team had problems against the play action pass game from Ryan Tannehill, leading to easy gains for the Titans offense. Finally, add in some poor clock management from Vic Fangio and the Broncos are 0-1. If the Broncos want to reach their full potential, they need to play without committing silly errors.

This week’s bombshell news in the semiconductor industry was NVIDIA’s announcement of their intent to buy Arm from SoftBank, a Japanese investment firm, for $40 billion. This deal will have widespread implications for both consumer electronics, like the device you are reading this right now, and the larger electronics industry as a whole.
Arm Limited is a UK-based semiconductor company that designs its own CPU architecture called ARM. Prominent customers of ARM include Apple, Samsung, and Qualcomm, who use ARM to design their mobile chips — the smartphone in your pocket is almost certainly powered by ARM. 
NVIDIA is also a semiconductor company, but it's based in the US and known mostly for its GPUs, such as the GeForce series for PC gamers, and GPUs designed for AI applications, such as the A100. NVIDIA also designs the CPU used in the Nintendo Switch, which is, as you may have guessed, based on ARM.
The implications of this deal are widespread. NVIDIA can finally step into the computer CPU market instead of only focusing on the GPU market, allowing them to compete with companies like Intel and AMD. This completes NVIDIA’s product folio, which currently does not include CPUs, and it puts the company in line with AMD and Intel, who develop both CPUs and GPUs. GPUs are used extensively in artificial intelligence, allowing NVIDIA to create AI solutions that bundle the advantages of both CPU and GPU technology — which is more difficult for NVIDIA’s competitors.
Second, this deal puts NVIDIA in a very strong position — possibly too strong — now that the company controls the chip architecture others need to design their CPUs. This puts NVIDIA in a powerful position to negotiate against them. A good example of this is Apple, who use chips based on ARM in all their mobile and tablet devices, with plans to develop ARM chips used in Mac laptop and desktop lineup as well. With NVIDIA’s ownership of ARM, Apple might have to agree to use NVIDIA GPUs in their products instead of their current selection of AMD GPUs, leading to the rise of a monopoly.
This can draw significant attention from regulators, which leads to a chance that this deal will not go through. There are a lot of parties at stake here, and there are a lot of incentives to block the deal. The UK, where Arm Limited is based, might reject the plan, since handing the technology to the U.S. could lead to job loss within the UK and more leverage for the U.S. in trade talks. Huawei, and by extension China, is not happy with the deal either since Huawei chips are ARM-based, and handing ARM over to the U.S. could result in more sanctions on Huawei. U.S. regulators might block the deal as well, since it could potentially create a market-dominating semiconductor company that leaves no room for its competitors, which may lead to inefficiencies and lack of innovation. 
NVIDIA’s proposed acquisition of ARM may create a brighter future for the development of AI, but it could also lead to a monopoly in the semiconductor industry, as well as significant government interference.

Designer brand COACH just released their Jean-Michel Basquiat collection. As a person with caviar tastes on a canned-tuna budget, I won’t be picking up anything. But hey, admiring Basquiat’s iconic street art from a distance doesn’t cost a dime.
As a fan of Basquiat’s work, I’m glad that more people are talking about him. I want to believe that having people know his name and his famous graffiti artwork is better than having him forgotten or be recognized simply as a friend of famous artist Andy Warhol. However, I can’t help being sad that his art is only halfway appreciated.
Don’t get me wrong—Basquiat has a distinct aesthetic and has left an indelible mark on the arts. It’s about time that we recognize not only his talent but his vision.
Basquiat used art as political commentary. Defacement (1983) is one obvious example. The sketch on artist Keith Haring’s wall captures the murder of Black artist Michael Stewart, who died thirteen days after being arrested by New York City Transit Police. Basquiat was no stranger to the prevalence of racism in America, but the news left him repeating: “it could have been me.”
Black American curator Chaédria LaBouvier later highlighted the piece’s significance: “Basquiat was aware that this was not just about Michael Stewart or even him, but that there is a history of state violence against the black body. And I think that’s what this painting represents: that history of state violence against the black body as an American heritage.”
Basquiat’s art also served to highlight the Black body. The artist saw the gross underrepresentation of Black people, both in history and in the present. He made the subjects in many of his pieces Black to shed light on this inequity, but also to celebrate the community’s resilience. This makes it all the more disheartening to see Basquiat collaborations that divorce Basquiat’s art from his message.
The most brazen instance that comes to mind is makeup brand Urban Decay’s 2017 Basquiat collection. Model Ruby Rose, who then was “the face” of the brand, proudly debuted the collection as if it were another launch. However, Basquiat’s art was overtly political; it’s naive to pretend otherwise. This was more than likely an unfortunate slip on the brand’s part, but it further shows the gravity of Basquiat’s advocacy.
COACH seems to have at least learned from similar oversights. Photographer Micaiah Carter told GQ that Basquiat “was a springboard for people to open up conversations that I think people weren’t having as often.” Some of the familiar faces modeling are Michael B. Jordan and Jennifer Lopez. Basquiat’s niece, Jessica Kelly, is also radiating in the campaign.
At the end of the day, I’m glad that more people are aware of Basquiat. His longtime friend and art collaborator Andy Warhol makes his way into pop culture and art education, but Basquiat falls by the wayside. Especially considering the political context that we are in, there’s no better time to champion the king of street art.

This new school year has brought a lot of new changes. The dining halls are no different. Most of the locations have new hours, limited menu options, and some places have fully shut down (cough cough Tazza). Here’s what you need to know about each dining location for the fall semester.  
ABP: Never go to ABP when ABP is the only place open. Because everyone. goes. to. ABP. ABP is a solid choice in a pinch. The quality is reliable and depending on the crowd, you can get your food quickly. I personally recommend the Chipotle Turkey & Avocado Sandwich with some salt and vinegar chips stuffed inside and crunched down. It’s a whole melty avocado chipotle crunchy tangy situation. Nothing to be mad about at ABP. In a rush, they can sometimes forget things — like taking the peel off the avocado. But overall, I would rate it a 7/10.    
The Exchange: Since getting to campus, at least 15 different people have told me that The Exchange is the best place on campus. I can assure you it lives up to the hype. The staff is super friendly and helpful, even when there’s a line out the door. I get a chicken salad melt with lettuce, tomato, banana peppers, honey mustard, and onions. If you’re into tuna, it’s good with that too. No matter what you get, the bread is always buttered and toasted to perfection, and the ingredients they use are fresh and high quality. If you’re vegetarian or just struggling to get veggies on campus, their grilled veggie sandwich is solid as well. Overall, I would rate it a 9/10. 
Food Hall at Resnik: Resnik feels like the quintessential college dining experience. The food there is surprisingly good. It’s the usual greasy cafeteria food, but it’s done well. The tater tots and pizza are good, but the daily specials are hit or miss. The last time I went, the grilled pineapple tofu was delicious. I would never go here as my first choice, but if you live close and it’s convenient, it’s never a bad option. I would rate it a 6/10.
El Gallo de Oro: This place gets a lot of mixed reviews. Some people are regulars. Some people throw it away after one bite. Some people have allegedly gotten food poisoning from it. The best way to comprehensively describe Gallo is like an off-brand chipotle. The quesadillas are done well (although it’s pretty hard to mess that up), but the bowls can be bland. Try it for yourself, if you dare. Rating: 5/10
La Prima: I go to La Prima at least twice a day. If my blocks somehow actually get used up by the end of the semester, I’ll have La Prima to thank. Their espresso is perfect: balanced, rich, but not bitter. Their lattes are popular. I got the caramel latte once and thought it was pretty artificial tasting, but the vanilla is great. The best part about La Prima is their iced dirty chai lattes. Yes, I get a little less respect from the Indian community every time I order it. No, I don’t care. Their baked goods are delicious, but they would be better if they were heated up. I get their sandwiches in a pinch, the club sandwich and chicken salad are great, but the egg salad is a little dry and the tortellini was weirdly sour. Don’t be the person who goes to a coffee shop and gets the tortellini. Overall, I would rate it a 9/10. 
Rohr Commons- Tepper Eatery: Tepper is another place I frequent. Their sushi is awesome—I would describe it as a little above Whole Foods quality. When you ask nicely, they’ll make you a fresh custom roll. I love to get a spicy crunchy salmon avocado roll, and if I’m feeling like I haven’t eaten anything nutritious in a week, I’ll get an avocado veggie roll. Tepper also has really fresh and simple teriyaki salmon that they sear to order. The kimchi fried chicken sandwich is also a really creative and fun dish. It’s crispy and fatty, but the vinegar in the kimchi cuts through just the right amount. The pizza looks cool coming out of the woodfire oven but smells and tastes cafeteria-esque. Overall, I would also rate this place a 9/10. 
Tartan Express/Tahini- Tahini is a beloved place in my friend group. Don’t come here when you’re in a rush — the guy inside, although lovely and helpful, does take his time. The fact that Tahini takes a long time is partly what makes it so good. They fry your falafel and pita fries fresh to order and dress the sandwiches and bowls with care. I love the falafel pita sandwich. I get sides of the Israeli chopped salad and the pita fries, which are strips of pita, deep fried to a golden brown blister and dusted with za’atar. Tahini, if you’re reading this, have you considered cinnamon sugar? Treat the pita fries and the ‘salad’ as a chips-and-salsa situation. You won’t regret it. The bowls are also pretty good, but they can get kind of mundane to eat after a while. I would rate this place 8/10. 
Taste of India- My opinions on this place are strong. And many disagree with me. When I went to Taste of India, the chicken curry was too salty to eat and the eggplant tasted like fish (which my friend corroborates. Hi Hannah). The Korma was palatable and the Naan was delicious, but the other two dishes really ruined it for me. Other people (non-Indians mostly) like this place, and it’s convenient that it’s open late and close to the dorms on the Hill. My opinion is that this place is a 5/10. Based on what the people around me say, I would rate it 7/10. 
The Underground- When they don’t randomly decide to shut down half their menu, The Underground is one of my go-to’s. Their burgers (regular and black bean) are classic and delicious. Their chicken quesadillas are almost always under filled, but the veggie ones are stuffed with peppers, onions, mushrooms, spinach, and cheese. It always hits. Their sweet potato fries, omelets, Meshugna (basically loaded latkes), berry french toast, and pulled pork sandwich are always great. Rating: 9/10. 
Zebra-  Zebra Lounge is, as its name suggests, covered ceiling to floor in zebra everything. The inside of the cafe is super cozy, even though the seating area is closed now, and the staff is always kind and friendly. When the temperature dips a little more, get the pumpkin black coffee. No creamer or sugar necessary, just the black coffee is incredible. The pastries are delicious and rumored to be from Prantl's Bakery on Walnut. Try the lemon poppyseed muffin or one of their soups on a colder day. The rule of thumb for this place is that if it sounds good, chances are it is. Except for the chai tea lattes. Go to La Prima for that.

Fires break out in a utopian late 1990s town called Shaker Heights in Ohio. A town based on all of the right virtues, images and people was set aflame because of one match and a large supply of natural gas. This match was Mia Warren and her daughter, Pearl. They become inextricably intertwined with the fates of the esteemed Richardson family. Once the Warrens chose this town to stay in for a while, everything in their lives and in Shaker changed. Uncomfortable questions about race, wealth, happiness and status quo are asked not only by the characters, but the readers and viewers. 
Celeste Ng’s book, Little Fires Everywhere was a New York Times bestseller for nearly fifty weeks, and many now equally associate the title with the Hulu series starring Kerry Washington and Reese Witherspoon. Ng was a producer on the series and subsequently kept the essence of the book, but she also approved a few new avenues for the series. Like many of the people who originally read the book first, I muttered, “this is not like the book,” several times while watching the series. Celeste Ng does not reveal the race of the Warrens in the book, although she intended them to be people of color. In the show, the Warrens are a family of Black women. The differences elevated the suburban, almost nondescript, conventional plot with poignant contemporary nuances, and the show discussed the complexities of the intersectionality of race and gender that the novel tiptoed around at times. 
A single nomadic mother and her daughter arrive as tenants of the wealthy Richardson family. Mia, the mother, is an artist, taking photographs all over the United States and going in whatever direction inspires her. They rent one part of a two-family house disguised as a single house. These duplexes are located at one end of town, but do not appear as duplexes to lessen the stigma of two-family homes. There are a lot of disguises in Shaker, despite its liberal and progressive foundations. The founders wanted a diverse and equitable town without violence, division, or detriment, as close to a utopia as they could get. That was their wish, which falls upon the shoulders of each subsequent generation. Elena Richardson, the matriarch of the Richardson family, is a local journalist, and her husband is a lawyer. They have four children, all in high school: Moody, Trip, Lexie and Izzy.
The novel features outsiders that disrupt a delicate conformity. Celeste Ng presents a lot of instances of intersectionality of race, gender, wealth, and status in this novel, but only venturing so far. All of the teens interact. Pearl, Mia’s daughter, befriends Yale-bound Lexie. In the novel, Lexie struggles with her Yale prompt of rewriting a fairy tale and Pearl, looking to ingratiate herself further with the Richardsons, offers to help write it for her. Lexie graciously accepts and uses the essay. She gets into Yale. 
In the series, the situation is a bit different. Lexie struggles to write her Yale essay to which the prompt is “adversity.” The main adversity in her life was writing about adversity, ironically. Her mother, Elena, denounces the prompt saying that her experience is still valuable, and just because her parents fought for a privileged life, her chances at Yale should not suffer. Concurrently, Pearl has a hard time getting the schedule she wants in her new high school in Shaker. Due to her mother’s creative occupation, Pearl has attended many different high schools, but she has still managed to take advanced classes. Her counselor will not let her take an advanced math class, despite the fact that Pearl has taken the prerequisite. 
He attributes it to the different curriculum in the high school, but in reality, two interacting prejudices dictated the decision. Pearl is upset and writes a letter about the situation, about the inherent racism and sexism she experienced. She asks Elena to read it, valuing her writing acumen, but Elena vehemently takes her side and inserts herself. Elena ‘takes care of it,’ rather than supporting Pearl in standing up for herself. Lexie catches hold of the letter and puts a spin on it for her own purposes. For her Yale essay, she describes Pearl’s situation, but solely through the lens of sexism. She describes her anger in being discouraged to take an advanced class because of a male counselor. She gets in. 
Lexie’s Black, Princeton-bound boyfriend initially sympathizes with her, but after he finds out the truth, he doesn’t view her the same way. She stole not only someone’s words, but someone's experience and the experience of many Black women for her own gain. This is one of the instances where the book did not delve or linger on the situation, it was implicit — the series makes it explicit and for good reason. 
Another pertinent issue addressed with poignancy is the intersection of motherhood, family structures, class, and race. There is a narrative backdrop, in the town of Shaker, concerning a Chinese baby that was left at a fire station by her destitute immigrant mother, Bebe. The mother has postpartum depression and struggles to live in America. This child fulfills the dreams of a couple who had numerous miscarriages in Shaker. Eventually, Bebe changed her mind. 
She wanted her daughter back and as she adjusts to her life in America realizes her profound loss. She searches for her daughter everywhere, but cannot find her. Mia facilitates the finding of the child and strikes a match to the prospective adoptive parents — one of the newly established families in Shaker. 
In the novel, Mia does not step further into the situation than this. In the series, Mia takes on a personal role in the court case, leveraging her story in testifying and providing money for a lawyer to help Bebe. Another important difference is that Elena and the mother of the Shaker family that was looking to adopt the child offered to pay Bebe off to step away silently from her child. Did Bebe have the right to change her mind? Was the baby better off with her adoptive family? Is blood thicker than water? What did the baby deserve — her biological mother and a life of love and struggle like with Mia or a life of love and luxury like with the Richardsons? 
This case rips Shaker apart. It’s a wildfire. Everyone has different opinions, although they feel pressured to support the Shaker family, who are good people and deserved a family after so much heartache.  
There are countless changes like these that bring many important issues to light. There are more flickers in the situations that Mia and Pearl face that brighten the series, not only for visibility of the issues, but for the gradual building of the massive fire at the Richardsons’ home. The Warrens and Richardsons become protagonists, and their stories become one for a period of time. 
The novel and series start with flames and end in them, but these flickers throughout both stories guide the viewers and readers. The flickers may be stronger in the series, but the story in both formats are equally well done and beautiful. This is one of the rare times that the adaptation improves and expands on its written source, but still keeps its integrity.

With campus events shifting to accommodate a cautious reopening for the fall semester, Carnegie Mellon Libraries has implemented new guidelines so that students can still safely use library resources.
To adhere to the university’s broader guidelines, Carnegie Mellon Libraries has implemented several physical distancing measures. The libraries have removed seating, installed plexiglass barriers, and implemented a seat reservation system at Hunt Library and Sorrells Library, where students can reserve a seat for up to two hours at a time. While the Sorrells and Mellon Library stacks are still open, Hunt Library’s stacks are closed, and librarians will retrieve items on request. 
"It was really based on whatever the university protocols were," Amy Perrier, Interim Head of Access Services at Hunt Library, told The Tartan. "Also, because we're a library, we have special library needs. We also looked out to the greater community to sort of see what other [libraries] were doing and what other precautions they were taking with the handling of materials."
To provide library resources digitally, the library purchased a subscription to a digital lending platform, "which will allow us to digitize print books and lend them to the campus community virtually while complying with copyright laws," Joelle Pitts, Associate Dean of Administration, Planning, and Assessment, told The Tartan in an email. Digital resources are not cheap, however.
"We are spending more on streaming video and ebooks. Our postage costs are also increasing as we attempt to mail materials to remote patrons that can’t pick them up locally," Pitts wrote. "The online/hybrid format of instruction this year has informed every stage of our budgeting process, and altered our spend[ing] accordingly – something we’ll continue to focus on this fiscal year to further support our students and researchers."
Carnegie Mellon Libraries began to plan how students could retrieve resources from the library safely in the beginning of summer. As the summer progressed and fall plans for the university as a whole became clearer, they began "shifting the focus toward safely reopening."
"How are we going to reopen? What's it going to look like? What's our hours going to look like? There were a million and one things," Perrier said. "Unfortunately, it seemed like it all came on us those first couple of weeks leading up to the beginning of the semester. It was a mad scramble to get everything in place and everything done. I wish we could have done more planning but...[t]here was just no way to know for sure…what the semester was gonna look like, so it was kind of at the last minute there."
Perrier said that before the semester started, she was concerned that the plexiglass they had ordered would not arrive on time. Perrier works at the circulation desk, and the libraries had planned to install plexiglass barriers at the desk to protect Perrier and other librarians. "I had a sleepless night the night before, thinking I was going to have to create something out of a shower curtain," Perrier said. " But [Facility Management Services] came through for us, they got us the plexiglass. So once that was put in, it felt like we [could] move forward and there [was] nothing to really be concerned about."
Now that these policies are in place, they may be here for the long run as waves of COVID-19 infections die down and normal campus operations resume. 
"Personally, I feel like we should keep [the seat reservation policy] because I think that over the years people have always been frustrated coming to the library and not finding a seat," Perrier said, adding that she’s also interested in continuing requests for item holds and scans of smaller or partial items like essays and book chapters. "Right now you have the ability to go in and reserve a seat, and when you show up at the library, your seat is waiting for you. That is something that I think for years people have always wanted. And now we have this brand new [seat reservation] software because of COVID. So I think this is something that might be in place if not for the entire library, at least a floor."

With a handful of positive cases and ample time to watch the school’s health and safety measures play out, it’s safe to say that some measures and policies may help to stop the spread, while others are seemingly useless or downright ridiculous. While any measure’s usefulness depends on individual safety practices, if the rules surrounding it don’t really help preserve our health and safety, the measure doesn’t work.
Starting from the ground up, floor stickers work sometimes. These little decals are meant to encourage a distance of at least six feet between people standing in lines. When lines are shorter, everyone stands on their sticker. The problem, however, is that many ignore floor stickers if there aren’t enough to support a long line. For example, The Underground has a room capacity of 48 but a primary line capacity of 14, with another five for mobile order pickups. This isn’t exclusive to The Underground, but considering most people in such places are usually in line, any notable differences in capacity can encourage line crowding. Finally, the rules surrounding floor stickers are often too relaxed, which, paired with poor layout and design, helps make line crowding a common sight on campus.
Not to be Mr. Negative, but the same logic applies to room limit signs. While it depends on both the building and room type, the rules regarding signs seem more relaxed. Signs only work sometimes because the rules surrounding them often become meaningless when they aren’t enforced or are broken. For larger room limits — say, more than 50 people — nobody really counts. On the bright side, RAs and faculty tend to step in if things get out of hand. What really promotes room limits is their noticeable lack of furniture. The signs, however, have become more of a joke, as some students have edited their PDFs and printed versions that say “Please do not lick the walls” or “1,000 Max Persons,” among other things.
Surprisingly, there is one safety measure that may be even more useless than those mentioned above. Outdoor signs don’t work. If you’re reading this, I’m assuming you already know to wear a mask and keep six feet away from others. As a student here, you shouldn’t need signs to remind you to wear a mask. The signs give obvious advice and just get snatched up and taken back to dorms in the evenings. It seems like they only really serve as a social media tool to tell parents and prospective students, “Look! We’re promoting safe practices.”
I’m not going to argue whether or not testing is a good practice. Looking back, however, the school’s approach to testing seemed so much more sophisticated and well-planned in their summer emails. Testing is certainly a great way to discover hidden cases in asymptomatic individuals. For testing to really work to its full potential, students on campus who don’t report symptoms should be tested more than just a few times, maybe even regularly. This and the current random selection testing are not the same.
Speaking of reporting symptoms, the daily self-assessment doesn’t really work. Whether it has any use really depends on the type of student taking the assessment. If a student indicates they have positive symptoms, they are responsible for seeking testing and treatment, making the survey more of a reminder than a tracker. On the other hand, some may be hesitant or dishonest about symptoms if they believe the survey will get them sent to isolation housing. It has an unclear purpose and an unclear result in limiting COVID cases on campus.
The administration has pulled off on-campus housing rather well, with a few exceptions. Communal bathroom fixtures just don’t work. In many residence halls, three students are assigned to the same toilet, shower, and sink, yet urinals are not since they are no contact. No, I don’t think fixture assignments should be removed, but it’s silly to pretend they will do anything in the event of an outbreak when a dozen students are actively sharing the same bathroom. 
When it comes to housing as a whole, the school was certainly justified in reducing its on-campus capacity limit. Doing this has, and likely will, help to keep everyone safe in a number of ways. For one, it de-densifies campus. Whether it’s residential buildings, classrooms, or campus as a whole, a lack of people will help to lessen the spread in the case of an outbreak. Reducing our capacity for housing has also cleared some serious space for isolation housing. While we thankfully have yet to justify its use of several buildings, we’re always better safe than sorry.
This may surprise you, but one thing I believe the school got right was their limiting of in-person lectures and recitations. In my experience, running into someone with less than three physical meetings per week is not unusual. While not true of everyone, I’m guessing there were quite a few students who based their decisions to live on campus this fall on the number of in-person classes they could get. Even if the school tried their best to squeeze out as many in-person gatherings as possible, their notable absence has helped cap the number of students who would otherwise live on or near campus.
De-densifying has been Carnegie Mellon’s golden egg of safety practices. Our campus is empty as can be; there’s no argument there. At most, a few groups can be seen sharing the cut. Meanwhile, you’re welcome to go see hundreds of University of Pittsburgh students gather near Forbes and Oakland Ave. on a Friday night. The glaring contrast should remind us that, as a smaller school, what we have can be sustained.
Nothing about this is normal. What we have is new and imperfect. Some of our safety measures don’t work and others could do with some improvement. Some things are fun to laugh at, and some may genuinely be helping us stay safe. In the end, we as Tartans are just as, if not more, responsible for maintaining the safety and health of our community. Maybe we’ll get sent home in a few weeks, but we still have the chance to make this work. 
Stay safe Tartans.
