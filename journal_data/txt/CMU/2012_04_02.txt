Even after herniating two discs in her lower back and tearing her psoas muscle, junior Kasey LaMothe returned to the volleyball court. “It is extremely hard coming back from an injury. Besides the mental issues, it is hard to get your body back in shape after being out for so long,” LaMothe said.
“She is hard-working and faces obstacles that are put in front of her with poise and dedication,” said sophomore teammate Amy Friedman.
Volleyball is a fall sport and LaMothe is already looking ahead to her next season, which will bring her to her twelfth season of playing. 
“I am hoping to continue to better my skills even though it is my last season. I don’t want to get lazy and I want to really enjoy the sport. I have high hopes that the team will come out on top in the UAA and even make the NCAA tournament,” LaMothe said.
LaMothe feels that team camaraderie really helps them work toward their goals. “My proudest moment was when we came back and won a game against a very tough team. We had to fight hard and everyone was so involved in the game. It was a really exciting game,” LaMothe exclaimed.
During the off-season, the volleyball team continues to lift and train regularly. One of LaMothe’s funniest moments happened during preseason. “During preseason, we get some time for aquatic practices. Coach [Kim Kelly] allows us to do water aerobics, which is hilarious to participate in and watch,” LaMothe said.
LaMothe enjoys her time on the volleyball team. “The best thing about being on the volleyball team is the actual team. I know that I can rely on any of the girls at any time,” LaMothe said.
“Kasey is a hard-working and talented player, and without her my freshman year would not have been as fun. I couldn’t have asked for a better passing partner, bus partner, working out partner, and best friend on the team,” said first-year teammate Jessica Uphoff.
LaMothe is currently majoring in biological sciences with a minor in biomedical engineering. In the future, she is looking into a career in the biomedical engineering field

The No. 5 ranked Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team hosted the No. 4 ranked Washington and Lee Generals on Saturday. After losing their last encounter with Washington and Lee 5–4 in the finals of the ITA Division III National Team Indoor Championship, the Tartans turned the tables and defeated the Generals 5–4 at home.
The Tartans split their first two double games. First-years Chelsea Motie and Bryn Raschke won 8–3, but sophomore Katie Cecil and first-year Angela Pratt suffered a tough loss 8–4.
The final doubles win came from the No. 1 pair, seniors Laura Chen and Courtney Chin. They fell behind 6–3 before making a run to win 9–7. This gave the Tartans a 2–1 advantage going into singles play.
The women’s tennis team sealed their victory winning the first three singles matches. First, Motie won in straight sets 6–1, 6–2. Next, Pratt won in straight sets, but had a slightly harder time. She needed to go to a tiebreaker in the first set for a 7–6 victory before winning the second set 6–4. 
Finally, senior Cze-Ja Tam clinched the victory winning in straight sets 7–6, 6–3.
With the victory sealed, the Tartans struggled, dropping their last three games. Chin battled hard, taking the first set into a tiebreaker but ultimately losing in straight sets 7–6, 6–1. Chen put up a tough fight dragging the match out to three sets before finally losing 6–1, 2–6, 6–2. Cecil also pulled her match out to three sets before falling 6–0, 1–6, 6–4.
“After losing to them at indoors, everyone came out fired up, especially since we were playing them at home. Being ahead after doubles was huge and everyone did a great job keeping the pressure on their opponents,” Cecil said.
With this win, the Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team improves to 13–3 for the year, having defeated ten nationally-ranked teams this season.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s golf team won the 2012 Titan Invitational hosted by Westminster College at the New Castle Country Club on Monday. Led by sophomore Ian Bangor, who was the top individual medalist at the event, the Tartans scored 313 to beat second-place Clarion University by nine strokes. 
This was Bangor’s fifth top-10 finish of the season, the most top-10 finishes on the team. His round score average of 76.1 on the 2011–12 season is also a team best. 
“Most of it was solid putting and just staying patient on a tough day for most of the competition,” Bangor said.
Bangor shot a 73 at the event, followed by senior Michael Cheng who shot a 77. Senior Terence Einhorn shot an 81 and sophomore Grant Strimel shot an 82. First-year Justin Fischler rounded out the team scoring an 84.
The Tartans also entered two individual golfers whose scores did not count towards the team score. First-year Derek Cobb carded an 82 and sophomore Matt Wilson shot a 93.
“The conditions were very difficult. You know that the scores were going to be high, so if you were playing bad you just had to try to do some damage control,” Wilson said. “We were fortunate enough to put up some decent scores and win the tournament.”
The Tartans did not compete in this event last year, but this victory is their first first-place finish since the Grove City Fall Invitational on Sept. 13, 2011. 
The next event for Carnegie Mellon men’s golf is Sunday and next Monday at the Mid-Atlantic Regional. The event will be held at the Hershey Country Club, with the first day starting at 11 a.m. and the second starting at 8 a.m.

Less than two weeks after he was released by the Indianapolis Colts, future Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning signed with the Denver Broncos. Manning chose the Broncos over the Arizona Cardinals, Miami Dolphins, Seattle Seahawks, Tennessee Titans, and San Francisco 49ers — all teams he had visited during the “Manning Free Agent Tour.”
The Denver front office and coaching staff were some of the main selling points for Manning. With former Broncos Hall of Fame quarterback John Elway leading the front office and experienced head coach John Fox directing the team, the Broncos’ management is both quarterback-friendly and experienced in the NFL.
The Broncos also have a much better supporting cast than the Colts have had over the past few years. Denver has a young, top-tier defense headed by linebackers Von Miller and Elvis Dumervil, who carried the team to the playoffs last year, and good receivers in Demaryius Thomas and Eric Decker.
The Broncos will also be returning most of their league-leading rushing attack led by running backs Knowshon Moreno and Willis McGahee.
Adjusting to the Broncos will be a challenge for Manning. This will be the first time in his professional career that his home stadium is not a dome and is wide open to the elements. For Manning, who forces the offensive play calling to pass first and uses the running game as a change of pace, the weather can potentially grind his offense to a halt.
There is also the issue of altitude. Aside from the effects on the actual football, the altitude change makes it harder for Manning and his teammates to catch their breath. He frequently used to hurry the offense in Indianapolis as a way to tire out the defense and to stop them from resetting after each play. With this altitude, Manning may be forced to slow down his offense so the larger offensive linemen have time to recover in between plays.
Manning may also have trouble adapting to some of the key role players around him. With the addition of Manning, the Broncos are switching from the running spread attack they used last year under starting quarterback Tim Tebow — who has since been traded to the New York Jets — to a much more pass-heavy offense.
Because of this transition, many players’ roles are changing dramatically. Tight ends in last year’s offensive scheme would focus on blocking first, with running routes and catching passes as afterthoughts. But with Manning under center, the Broncos’ tight ends are expected to be more like wide receivers than offensive linemen. To ease this transition, the Broncos have acquired former Colts back-up tight end Jacob Tamme who, due to injuries to starter Dallas Clark, has developed a very good rapport with Manning.
The biggest challenge for Manning will ultimately be his health.
While it is true that he was one of the best quarterbacks in Indianapolis, he is coming back from four neck surgeries. The team obviously believes he is at least close to his previous level of play, but the risk is still there.
The Broncos have a lot more riding on Manning than just money. Even though their contract with Manning has health contingencies, the Broncos will still be in serious trouble if he goes down. They do not have a competent backup yet, and they still need a quarterback for when 36-year-old Manning inevitably retires.
The partnership of Manning and the Broncos is not without risks, but both sides seem to think the possible rewards outweigh them.
There will be high expectations of playoff successes, and any struggles will have Broncos fans enraged about the swap of winning, fan-favorite Tebow for Manning.

Last week, after finishing her quantum physics exam, Ashley Disbrow moved on to her next task of the day: working towards a better understanding of stars, galaxies, and the origins of the universe.
Disbrow, a sophomore in the physics department, is currently working on a project analyzing redshift distributions of quasars in the universe from data collected at the Apache Point Observatory in Sunspot, N.M. In other words, she is determining the positions of thousands of luminous, highly energetic galaxies relative to each other. 
A better understanding of this kind of data can help scientists draw more concise conclusions about the origins of the universe. Disbrow’s work is supervised by Shirley Ho, an assistant professor of physics.
Disbrow is passionate about physics and cosmology, and explained that the continuous explorations in these fields have come to define part of who she is today.
“I’ve always had hobbies in astronomy through middle and high school,” Disbrow said. “I wanted to pursue that as a major.... I thought that would be a great thing to do for my job in the future.”
She recalled her time as an eighth grader running through mission simulations at Space Camp in Huntsville, Ala. She pointed out that after the experience, she decided she “wanted to be an astronaut.” This interest ultimately led to Disbrow’s current position as an undergraduate majoring in and researching physics at Carnegie Mellon.
So what does a typical day in the field look like for this researcher?
“When I ‘go to work,’ I normally just log off my Windows partition and pull up Linux,” Disbrow said. “I open a terminal and I type. There’s a lot of programming involved, especially in IDL, which is the programming language I’ve been using.”
IDL, or Interactive Data Language, is a data analysis programming language used often in the astronomy and cosmology fields. While picking up the language was initially a difficult task for Disbrow, constant development in this environment helped her learn the ropes.
“A lot of the data that I produce goes into the algorithms written by the post-docs that I’m working with,” Disbrow said. “They’ll sort of include it in the simulations or the models that they’re making. Plus they helped me program in IDL, so that was good.”
In addition to the Carnegie Mellon physicists she collaborates with, Disbrow also gets constant exposure to the larger scientific body around the field of physics.
“I’ve gotten to meet a lot of really interesting people through this research,” Disbrow said. “The Cosmology Department has weekly seminars all planned out between Carnegie Mellon and [the University of Pittsburgh]. They’ll fly someone in from out of town [to speak]. So I’ve gotten to meet some cool people involved in physics from different universities around the country.”
Excluding research, Disbrow is taking 41 units of classes this semester and explained that balancing classes with her research is no easy task.
“It can be a struggle,” she said. “I think that the best way to tackle it is to manage your time really efficiently.”
Aside from her research and academic schedule, Disbrow is also involved in multiple other extracurricular activities. She is on the Carnegie Mellon water polo team, and just recently picked up an interesting hobby.
“I’ve taken up gliding as a sport this past summer,” Disbrow said. “It’s a lot of fun.”

Sneezing, coughing, and itchy eyes bring torment to many during what should be the joyous coming of spring. Allergies, seemingly trivial compared to other ailments, are one of the biggest public concerns due to the sheer number of people that suffer from them. 
The specific form of allergies that brings sneezing, coughing, and itchy eyes is called allergic rhinitis — meaning that it causes inflammation of the mucus membranes in the nose. More serious allergies can be life threatening, such as severe food allergies to peanuts and crustaceans. Other allergies can develop over time in reaction to certain cosmetics and food additives.
Allergies are an immune system response to antigens, or pathogenic particles. The immune system responds to antigens by producing antibodies, the defensive proteins that allow the immune system to find invading substances. The antigens in food are harmless; otherwise many people would suffer from food toxicity. According to the Utrecht Center for Food Allergy, when an allergy-causing antigen is present in the body, immunoglobulin E, or IgEs, antibodies that fight antigens, are produced and released.
If an antibody comes in contact with its antigen, the antibody causes the release of factors that result in common allergy symptoms. These factors trigger the body to begin three basic processes: blood vessels expand to increase their permeability which causes inflammation; stimulation of mucus secretion, which is seen as a runny nose; and stimulation of nerves, which induces sneezing. The first process increases blood flow to the area and allows immune cells through the blood vascular walls so they can begin to fight the expected infection. The latter two processes block incoming particles from reaching the cells and attempt to physically remove the invading species.
One common way of detecting which substances people are allergic to is a radioallergosorbent test (RAST), which looks for the presence of IgEs against known antigens by injecting the antigens into the body. Another technique is a skin prick test, which exposes patients to a variety of antigens; the doctor examines the prick site to analyze redness and swelling in the area. However, these tests have low accuracy. Just because IgEs are present in a patient doesn’t mean that patients will develop a clinical response upon exposure; redness and swelling are highly subjective and are difficult to measure.
According to the Utrecht Center, a double blind placebo-controlled food challenge is the best test despite its high cost. The test involves having patients consume foods that may or may not contain various antigens in various concentrations; both of these variables are initially unknown to both the doctor and the patient. These tests, however, are not often administered because they take several days to complete and require specially trained personnel to administer.
The worst possible outcome of any allergic reaction is anaphylaxis, or allergic shock, which is caused by extreme immune responses. Blocked or spasmodic air ways cause breathing difficulties. Dangerously low blood pressure then leads to unconsciousness and possibly heart failure. Less severe symptoms are hives or swelling, dizziness, and nausea.
Allergies present a huge market for pharmaceutical companies. Unlike antibiotics for infections, patients never stop taking allergy treatments, which allows for continuous revenue. In addition, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, allergies in the United States appear to be increasing. During every exposure to foreign particles, the body will make antibodies, making it increasingly important to examine the nature of products we use and are exposed to.

Discovery points to new species of human ancestor
A team of paleoanthropologists recently discovered foot bones in Burtele, Ethiopia that are 3.4 million years old and may point to a new species of hominids or human ancestors. The only other hominid bones found from that period belong to the specimen “Lucy,” a collection of bones believed to be a close relative to modern humans. Lucy’s discovery has provided insight into how humans may have evolved to have larger brain sizes and walk on two feet.
The newly found bones belong to a hominid from the same time period as Lucy, but their shape is significantly different. These bones suggest that the hominid was bipedal, but also had the ability to climb trees.

Scientists from ‘faster than light’ experiment resign
Two scientists at the CERN Laboratory who reported the discovery of particles traveling faster than the speed of light resigned this past week. Spokesperson of the group Antonio Ereditato and scientist Dario Autiero resigned, claiming that increasing tension within the research group was the reason for their departures.
In early September, the research group revealed results showing neutrinos (neutrally charged subatomic particles) to be moving faster than the speed of light. Their results shocked physicists around the world by disproving one of the fundamental ideas of modern physics. Recently, the group had reported that their earlier result may have been due to a malfunctioning clock that measured the time of the neutrino’s journey.

Team designs tiny robots that will inspect health
A research team based at Newcastle University in the United Kingdom is currently designing a tiny in-body robot that will travel through a patient’s bloodstream to look for signs of illness. Scientists are modeling the robot after the sea lamprey, a parasitic fish common to the Atlantic ocean that senses its environment extremely well.
The robot will be less than a centimeter in length and will be coated with mammalian cells that naturally have sensors that respond to light and smell. Using the data from the sensors, scientists will be able to “see” the inside of the human body. The team is currently building the individual components of the robot, but hopes that the robot will be used on people within five years.

Google tests self-driving car on blind man
Google has taken the next step in testing their self-driving car by placing a civilian behind the wheel. Steve Mahan, a man who is 95 percent blind, sat behind the driver’s seat while the self-driving car drove him around to pick up his laundry and go through a Taco Bell drive-though. The car used information in its computer’s database to obey speed limits. Mahan said that it “was some of the best driving that he has ever done.”
Since announcing the self-driving car project in 2012, Google has registered over 200,000 miles of computer-led driving. The car relies on laser range finders, radar sensors, video cameras, and detailed software to successfully make automated driving safe and practical.

Branson to rival Cameron’s trip to the deep trench
After movie director James Cameron recently made his trip to the bottom of the Mariana Trench to film the environment, Sir Richard Branson, billionare tycoon and adventurer, announced plans to make his own deep sea trip to the floor of the Puerto Rico Trench.
Unlike the Mariana Trench, which has been explored extensively, the Puerto Rico Trench has a depth greater than the height of Mount Everest and is relatively unexplored. In addition to satisfying his thirst for adventure, Branson hopes to uncover British and Spanish galleons that are suspected to have settled on the sea bed. As the founder of Virgin Group, Branson will use a newly built Virgin Oceanic craft to conduct his voyage in four months.

Bees display self-medication when infected
Researchers at North Carolina State University have found that when bee colonies are infected with fungus, the bees produce 45 percent more resin to fight off the pathogen. Normally, bees use a resin called propolis to fill cracks in their hives to protect it from fungus.
Due to the increasing fear of bees becoming extinct, scientists are trying to understand more about the insects. This new knowledge helps beekeepers understand that the resin is the bees’ natural defense — the bees use their anti-fungal characteristics to ensure survival.

The Carnegie Mellon School of Music has a lot to be proud of. Founded in 1912, the school celebrates its 100th birthday this year. The list of Carnegie Mellon alumni who have gone on to hold high-caliber positions in leading orchestras and opera houses is extensive, and with the continuation of the school’s rigorous training, the success stories show no sign of stopping.
To celebrate the School of Music’s centennial, special concerts and events are taking place. One such concert was a collaboration between the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic Orchestra and Choirs, which took place Downtown last Saturday at the Benedum Center. The performance featured School of Music alumni, current students, and guest artists.
A Brief History
The School of Music, which expanded from the Department of Music in 1997, has always placed an emphasis on excellence. Maintaining this view, the program’s focus has varied over the years as leadership positions have changed hands within the school. The first brick of the College of Fine Arts building was laid on April 25, 1912. The building now stands complete with magnificent pillars, elaborate ceiling frescoes, and marble floors, and it serves as the hub for Carnegie Mellon’s music and art departments.
The Carnegie Mellon music department was originally created to train future Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) members. Although PSO operations were suspended between 1910 and 1926, the two organizations had a close relationship from the beginning, with former and future PSO musicians frequently hired as faculty.
Both World War I and World War II drew attention away from the music department. In its early years, the school focused heavily on music education, producing many music teachers for public schools in the Pittsburgh area.
Later, with the arrival of renowned artists like composer Leonardo Balada and choral conductor Robert Page, the school took a turn for the more performance-oriented. In the ’80s and ’90s, additions to the faculty included Grammy-nominated violinist Andrés Cárdenes and New York Philharmonic principal flautist Jeanne Baxtresser. These additions further advanced the school’s standards and introduced a conservatory culture.
Within this time, a Baroque Ensemble and a Contemporary Ensemble formed. New programs were introduced, including a music and technology degree, a composers’ forum, a musical theatre program, and a major in bagpiping — all of which broadened and deepened the impact of the School of Music.
In an effort to discover details about the early years of the century-old music department, assistant professor of musicology Robert Fallon researched the Carnegie Mellon archives. Fallon found that standards of performance were likely quite high in the institution’s early days. Programs show that repertoire included Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto and Johannes Brahms’ Clarinet Sonatas, challenging works that require advanced proficiency on an instrument.
Associate head of the School of Music Natalie Ozeas has been involved with the Carnegie Mellon music department since 1955, when she enrolled as a student. Ozeas has earned numerous degrees and certifications at Carnegie Mellon and has been on faculty for 24 years. In her time at the university, Ozeas has witnessed substantial change. “It has been a delight to see the School of Music grow in size and quality,” she said. “Most recently, the school is expanding to provide opportunities for the development of skills necessary for musicians in the twenty-first century.”
As the career field for music performance suffers with the downturn of the economy, the school has recognized the need for its students to learn entrepreneurial skills and to develop a practical career goal within the music industry. There is no doubt that the institution will move in a positive direction while maintaining its historical reputation for excellence.
Centennial Celebration Concert
The celebratory concert on Saturday was an exciting success. Created with the diverse and global perspective of Carnegie Mellon in mind, the program demonstrated the impressive skills of musicians associated with Carnegie Mellon.
The Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic Orchestra, Repertory Chorus, and Concert Choir joined forces, comprising 200 current students in its entirety.
Concertmistress Sonia Shklarov led the orchestra unwaveringly throughout. Manu Narayan, an alumnus screen actor and vocalist seen in the movie The Last Airbender, was Master of Ceremonies.
The show opened with the Philharmonic’s rendition of British composer Bernard Rands’ Danza petrificada. In this mysterious piece, delicate woodwind and brass solos interwove through strong string melodies.
Next on the program was the jaw-dropping first movement of Henryk Wieniawki’s Violin Concerto No. 1 in F-sharp Minor, Op. 14. Here, senior violin major Emma Steele, a recent Sibelius International Violin Competition finalist, took center stage. Her technical proficiency was showcased as she executed the work’s double stops, glissandi, and arpeggios with seeming ease.
The third piece on the program featured two male vocalists who graduated from Carnegie Mellon’s music department in 2003. Jeffrey Behrens and Liam Bonner gave a dramatic rendition of La donna è un animale, a selection from Gaetano Donizetti’s opera L’elisir d’amore. Wind and brass players were well-mannered with their intermittent musical statements, allowing the bold vocal soloists to shine.
Robert Schumann’s Konzertstück concluded the first half. Alumnus Dale Clevenger, horn player in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for the last 45 years and three-time Grammy award winner, conducted the piece. The work featured four amazing french horn soloists. William Caballero, principal horn in the PSO and artist lecturer at Carnegie Mellon, led on first part with a warm and confident sound. Principal horn of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Brice Andrus, alumnus Howard Wall of the New York Philharmonic, and alumnus Peter Rubins of the San Antonio Opera filled the other three spots. These four brass voices blended with impeccable intonation and accuracy, making the fiery piece a success.
Deborah McDowell, a first-year master’s student in horn performance, also performed as a member of the accompanying orchestra for the piece. “[This piece] is really one of the most difficult compositions written for horn,” she said. “To hear it played so well is really inspiring.”
Throughout the concert, music directors Ronald Zollman and Page, former choral conductor, took turns directing the ensemble. After the intermission, Page took to the podium. A legend himself, Page worked with the Cleveland Orchestra from 1971 to 1989 and has worked with the PSO and Carnegie Mellon choirs ever since. The second half of the performance featured four popular songs with vocal soloists.
Agustín Lara’s “Granada,” a love song featuring alumna Lisa Vroman, opened with a sensual Latin trumpet solo by senior trumpet major Dan Blumenfeld. Blumenfeld’s spicy melodic lines set the stage for what was to come: Vroman danced along with the piece, ending with a flamenco kick and an impassioned kiss for Page.
The Carnegie Mellon Choirs joined in on George Gershwin’s classic “Our Love Is Here to Stay.” The piece was arranged by Page and orchestrated by David Gedris, who graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 1996 with a degree in trumpet performance.
Later in the evening, a haunting ballad from the Broadway hit Ragtime, “Back to Before,” featured soprano alumna Christiane Noll. Noll is known as one of the most versatile stage performers of her generation. She sang the part with experience and conviction.
Zollman reclaimed the podium for the final work. In collaboration between the orchestra and choirs, students rounded out the night with Alexander Borodin’s folkloric “Polovetsian Dances” from the opera Prince Igor. A virtuoso solo was executed by Kelly Coyle, a master’s student in clarinet performance. Here, the idiosyncrasies that arise when coordinating instrumentalists with vocalists were handled nicely.
The Centennial Celebration Concert was a highly successful event, featuring an impressive array of alumni and student performers.
The concert will be performed for a second time on Monday at Carnegie Hall in New York City.

The Mexican War Streets district of Pittsburgh’s North Side is the unlikely host of many small artistic treasures. Along Sampsonia Way, the fenced-in backyards and cratered streets stand alongside historic row houses painted with colorful murals. Among these hidden treasures is the Mattress Factory, a museum that specializes in installation art.
Despite its modest location, the museum attracted a significant crowd for the opening of its newest exhibit on Friday night. Gestures: Intimate Friction, guest curated by Carnegie Mellon adjunct associate professor of architecture Mary-Lou Arscott, showcases an intersection of the work of artists, architects, and activists. Keeping true to the museum’s focus on installation art, the exhibit features engaging and interactive pieces that charm viewers and explore how art can expand into the spaces around us.
The exhibit is being displayed in a smaller building on Monterey Street, rather than the museum’s main building on Sampsonia Way, so the venue for the reception was very small. The turnout continued to grow over the course of the reception; the narrow hallways and small rooms were crammed with guests casually chatting, drinking beer, and viewing the art.
Adjunct assistant professor in Carnegie Mellon’s School of Architecture Nick Liadis’ “Space of Sound/Sound of Space” features hundreds of thin, white, braided ropes hanging from the ceiling. Viewers had to fight through them and oftentimes inadvertently thwacked each other in order to pass.
Artist and Carnegie Mellon Masters of Fine Arts alumna Jenn Gooch took a different approach to playing with the space in her work, “Home Splice: Doorway.” With a video projected onto a door-sized wall, Gooch created the illusion that viewers were glimpsing a woman from the other side of a door that had been left ajar. Even though the woman was an image on a wall, the piece evoked a sense of forced intimacy. Gooch’s and Liadis’ work, among others, enabled museum guests to physically engage in the art, simply by being part of the space around them.
While artists and architects have a large representation in the exhibit, activists have their voices too. One piece titled “Inside, Outside, Inside: walls are built” by Braddock initiative Transformazium was created to bring about change in a neighborhood that faces many social and economic challenges. Artfully arranged debris from a deconstructed Braddock parish house and other materials give viewers an artistic lens through which they can view a very real and tangible activist effort. This piece was a welcome contrast to some of the more abstract works featured in the exhibit.
The highlight of the exhibit was undoubtedly architect and activist Ling He’s “Wish exchange dandelion,” playfully showcased in a room filled with red and white balloons. Volunteers and museum staff encouraged people passing through to write their wishes on ribbons and attach them to the balloons. This piece was by far the most interactive in the exhibit, relying exclusively on the guests’ willingness to take part. “It is defined with how much each participant would like to give,” said the piece’s description in the gallery program. In a ceremony later that evening, museum guests took the red balloons outside and released them into the air.
While a nice idea, the balloon-releasing ceremony was less than practical. Several of the balloons made little progress before getting caught in telephone cables and trees. Despite these difficulties, however, the ceremony had the lovely effect of bringing all of the museum guests together. While museum-goers usually live in their own worlds, viewing the art at their own pace or socializing in small groups, this part of the exhibit created a rare, unifying set of circumstances: The art became a means through which people connected to each other, rather than merely connecting to the art.
The Gestures: Intimate Friction exhibit engages its audience in every sense of the word. By viewing this exhibit, guests of the Mattress Factory have the chance to physically experience art, rather than simply look at canvases mounted on a wall. This newest exhibit is a prime example of exactly what the Mattress Factory does best: expand the boundaries of art until the art literally inhabits the space around us.
Gestures: Intimate Friction will show at the Mattress Factory through Nov. 30.

The news of Adrienne Rich’s death pulled me from bed to bookshelf. Three of her tomes were there, spines broken and pages dog-eared. Well-loved and well-worn, these books were my refuge, my release, my rage-fuel. But now they were not filled with the words of a living, breathing, fighting woman; rather, they now were the legacy of Rich.
Rich was a woman, a Jew, a lesbian, and most importantly, a poet. Across more than twenty poetry collections, Rich defined a voice that explored feminism, love, homosexuality, politics, aging, marriage, and war. Under nearly all of it was a burning anger against inequalities and injustices in our world. She was a master of refining those topics into brutally stark emotions and clean framings of complex issues.
Rich’s ability to harness her own perspectives and feelings into verse is why she won dozens of awards over the 60 years she was publishing, and why her poems are so deeply treasured by those who read them. In her foreword to the 1984 publication of The Fact of a Doorframe, she said, “Over the years it has seemed to be just that — the desire to be heard, to resound in another’s soul — that is the impulse behind writing poems.” That is what she achieved for me, for an entire generation before me, and for countless more as we now collect the entire body of work that she left us.
The themes in her work are still so desperately needed today. A woman’s gender still puts her at a disadvantage, two people of the same gender cannot have equal relationships under the law, and we continue to kill human beings as we jump from war to war.
But even if we had equality, acceptance, and peace, Rich’s language is a paragon itself. The beauty in her poetry is not just in her confrontation of issues that are of the utmost importance to her and the minorities she supports, but is also in her passion for language. This is poetry: A master using words and phrases to evoke an emotional response layered in a palimpsest of cultural fragments and societal issues.
My hope for our future is that we can all take a moment from our days filled with the injustices of society, the continued warmongering, the rush and pace of modern technology, and, for just a moment, visit Rich’s authentically human voice. My hope is that you can let her speak to your soul as she has to mine.
In “Diving Into the Wreck,” Rich, narrating, took her camera, her knife, her book of myths: They were her tools. They were the devices with which she explored and dug into the world. For me, and for myriad readers living today, we need more than that. For us, Rich was the knife. She was the camera. She showed me how to dig deeper than I thought possible. She taught me how to see myself, how to explore, and how to rage. Farewell.
Adrienne Rich died on March 27, 2012 in her home. Her last book of poetry, Tonight No Poetry Will Serve: Poems 2007-2010, was published in January 2011.

The Frame was once again transformed into a new space last Friday night — this time decked out in rainbow streamers, Skittles, and new student work. The BXA Kaleidoscope Show, an annual showcase of the work done by students in the BXA interdisciplinary program, featured a diverse range of work that exemplified the spirit of the program. According to the BXA program’s website, the mission of the program is to “foster the creativity of students who explore innovative approaches to the academic environments of two colleges.”
The work featured in the show included technical architecture projects, video, photography, sculpture, and drawing, as well as a musical performance. Each piece was unique, but the range of artwork from the 17 submissions was confusing at times. The only factor tying the pieces together was that the creators were all BXA students, so each piece was the result of the creators combining their two distinct passions into a single work.
The back room of the gallery was transformed into a “laser maze” made out of streamers where participants had to avoid the “lasers” in order to retrieve a Hershey’s Kiss from a bowl in the corner. Henry Armero, a first-year studying computer science and art, said, “It’s wonderful, it makes me really happy!” When asked about the show in general, Armero said that he was a fan of the wild décor and the streamers running throughout the gallery.
“Trashy Fashion” — a piece by Janet Lorenz, sophomore Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student in environmental studies and art — was a full-scale victorian-inspired dress made of plastic bags, bubble wrap, and a paper bag. Junior Bachelor of Science and Arts student Shephaly Soni showed two paintings. The first depicted a body with a harsh, diseased-looking red spot consuming its right side, while the second was a more abstract piece, painted in fleshy tones of what appeared to be flowers and vein-like lines running through it. The description of the piece read, “I’m a painter who wants to be a surgeon. While art is a part of who I am, I hope to pursue medicine, global health, and specific surgery.”
Julie Mallis, a senior Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student in art and anthropology, and Madeleine Barnes, a senior Bachelor Humanities and Arts student in art and creative writing, curated the show. When asked about the large number of Skittles and rainbow paraphernalia, Mallis responded, “We thought that was sort of like an emblem for us, like ‘taste the possibilities of combining your majors.’ ”
Mallis also shared that after reading an article in The New York Times explaining that Skittles have recently become an symbol of support for Trayvon Martin, they decided to include the candy as a gesture of support. “Its kind of nice to say we also stand in solidarity with Trayvon Martin,” Mallis said. “And I think that’s in the spirit of interdisciplinary as well — bringing people together and embracing differences.”
At 8 p.m. a band called The Faculty, which includes senior Bachelor of Humanities and Arts student in architecture and economics Samuel Lavery, played in the corner of the gallery. The group teamed up with Pittsburgh rapper FRZY to create a hybrid jazz and rap sound. The first song they played began with a funky rendition of “My Funny Valentine,” which transitioned into a smooth rap and then a few minutes of improvisation by the various instruments in the seven-piece band. This included saxophone, drums, guitar, standing bass, keyboard, a female vocalist, and FRZY. The music drew in a variety of visitors as the music flowed through the space, giving the event a more welcoming vibe.

“It’s new every day. As a director you’re watching the same thing day after day, but you have to start fresh each day as if you don’t know anything at all. This helps you to look at it in the perspective of the audience.”
This is director Daniella Topol’s personal philosophy when it comes to directing. Topol received her Bachelor of Fine Arts and Masters of Fine Arts in directing from Carnegie Mellon and is known for her contemporary work. She has gained critical acclaim worldwide and has recently been working with Quantum Theatre in Pittsburgh on the world premiere of playwright Stefanie Zadravec’s The Electric Baby.
The production features a number of Carnegie Mellon alumni in addition to Topol. Actor Nick Lehane, who received his Bachelor of Fine Arts, and lighting director C. Todd Brown, a current faculty member in the School of Drama, both make an appearance.
The Electric Baby tells the tale of a baby born to a Nigerian father and a Romanian mother who now lives in Pittsburgh. The play is a heart-wrenching personal story integrated with Romanian folktales. Zadravec described it as “an earnest, heartfelt play” that she wrote during a trying period of her life. Her trials and tribulations in struggling with her own son’s illness were an inspiration for the story. Given the personal nature of the story, Topol admitted that this play was a step out of every cast member’s comfort zone.
The world premiere of The Electric Baby was last Friday. The production is a joint venture with Quantum Theatre, a theater that has found unique footing in Pittsburgh. “We are a company that explores the language of theatre and how theatre communicates,” said producer Karla Boos. Keeping this idea in mind, Quantum Theatre has lent the play a new perspective by using unconventional spaces to stage the environment. The audience is part of the setting and by virtue a part of the play. In this manner, Quantum Theatre has successfully transformed the role of the audience by drawing them into a colorful, sensory experience.
The cast came from diverse backgrounds with a wide range of experiences, and each cast member brought something unique to the play. Talking about the biggest challenge for each cast member, Topol said, “People always go through an internal struggle in producing their best work.”
Topol’s personal philosophy on directing has helped her achieve personal fulfillment and success in her career. She aims to make each piece of theater an educational experience. Topol, Boos, and Zadravec also came to campus last week to speak to dramaturgy students about their personal experiences in the field of theater. Their presence and Topol’s personal success were an inspiration to the students in the School of Drama.
The Electric Baby will run through April 22 at the Waldorf School of Pittsburgh.

Given the chill and nostalgic music that has been trending recently, it is not uncommon to go to a concert in which a majority of the crowd simply stands and watches a band play. Listeners check their phones and talk to their friends. They have the exact same experience they would have listening to an album in their car. This is not, however, the experience of a Cursive concert. Last Wednesday, Cursive performed at Mr. Small’s Theatre with Cymbals Eat Guitars and Conduits and provided an energetic musical experience that kept fans engaged throughout the show.
Conduits, an indie rock sextet based out of Omaha, Neb., was the first opening band. Despite releasing their debut album on March 20, they performed a cohesive set that mixed the straightforward arrangements of pop rock with the sonic textures of shoegaze and psychedelic rock. The crowd was small for Conduits’ set, but it was clear that the pulsating bass lines and beautiful guitar ­— imagine rippling water as a sound instead of a vision — captivated these dedicated fans completely.
By the time Cymbals Eat Guitars, a Staten Island-based quartet, took the stage, the audience had grown considerably. The band delivered a visceral performance of material mainly off their album Lenses Alien. The highlight of their set was their performance of “...And the Hazy Sea” off their debut album, which featured spastic lighting and an improvised solo by lead singer and guitarist Joe D’Agostino. The feel of their set contrasted sharply from their recorded material. While their records are cleanly produced, their live performance sounded much more like a wall of sound, which highlighted their shoegaze influences.
Before Cursive even began its set, audience members began chanting the name of lead singer and guitarist Tim Kasher. When the band took the stage, however, the members did not seem to take notice of the packed room and immediately began their set. While the audience had been receptive to Conduits and Cymbals Eat Guitars, it was absolutely enraptured with Cursive. Fans screamed and sang along to the fifteen-song set and four-song encore that Cursive provided, while several fans moshed spontaneously throughout the night.
While the opening bands both sounded very modern, Cursive’s sound straddled the angsty pop-punk characteristic of the early 2000s and the more recent indie trends. Their songs would drop suddenly from a hard-hitting melody to Kasher singing softly into the mic with lyrical dexterity. About half an hour into the set, Kasher addressed the crowd as if they were old friends and indulged some drunken fans in an argument about whether Millvale or Pittsburgh was better.
While a majority of the audience had come for Cursive, it was difficult not to leave as a fan of all three groups. Between the unique and captivating performances and the band members themselves manning the merchandise table, concert goers were treated to a night of musical participation instead of passive co-existence.

“They love artists at the IRS,” joked performance artist Brody Condon during his lecture in McConomy Auditorium last Tuesday. The lecture was part of the College of Fine Arts lecture series. Condon has been fully engaged in his art since he graduated with a Masters of Fine Arts in visual arts from of the University of California at San Diego in 2002, but still has no answers for the IRS when it comes to how long his “company” has been running.
After receiving a classical education in sculpture, Condon stepped into performance art and installation. In his 1998 sculptural performance art piece titled “Room,” Condon addressed his post-traumatic stress. In the piece, Condon set up a bare wooden frame of a room in a dried-up lake bed outside of Los Angeles. He then suspended himself for hours within the frame, held up only by pig intestines. His only audience for this piece was the all-terrain vehicles that would infrequently pass by the installation.
Condon now draws audiences everywhere he goes, from the New York Museum of Modern Art to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art to an expansive park in the Netherlands.
Condon often works with live action role-playing (LARP) in his performance arts. At the Dutch Sonsbeek Sculpture Exhibition in 2008, Condon directed a complex LARP performance, titled “Twentyfivefold Manifestation.” During the piece, the players created entirely new personas and cultures. They fabricated new gods around the sculptures of other artists, and even spent days on end in a sculptural tower of worship.
Condon asserted that he still wanted to hold on to the subculture of LARP and let the performers add their own detail to the scenario. “They bring their own material and their own interest. I only worry about their subjective experience if it gets dangerous or they break character,” Condon said.
In another performance art piece called “LevelFive,” Condon focused on the authenticity of the participant’s experience. The piece, which was installed multiple times throughout 2010 and 2011, is a reference to the self-realization seminars that became popular in the 1970s. The two-day experiment pushed volunteers to extremes in an attempt to recognize their true faculties. Condon said it was “kind of like creating a sort of experiential essay.”
Condon would at times debrief with his players, in order to “roll through what looks like a very extreme experience.” Additionally, he established tools that enabled the participants to check in with one another emotionally without breaking character. “For me personally, that’s the audience — that’s the point,” Condon said.
Third-year graduate student in the fine arts Agnes Bolt identified the contrast among performance, role-playing, and technology in Condon’s work. “[The] work speaks for itself... about the space of messiness in our mind,” Bolt said.
Crystal Yip, a first-year art major, knew about Condon from a class taught by visual culture and critical theory professor Melissa Ragona. “It’s interesting,” Yip said. “We still don’t understand everything.” Nonetheless, Yip said the talk helped to demystify some of Condon’s work.

Hailing from the vast expanses of South Dakota, Rachel Ries can bring grown men to tears.
Songwriting is an inextricable part of existence for Ries, who is constantly crafting songs. She has released myriad recordings, two highlights of which are On Laurel Lake EP and Without a Bird.
Besides overflowing with massive doses of honesty, On Laurel Lake EP reveals skilled production and recording techniques. In this album, Ries’ trembling harmonies punctuate her sophisticated melodies. Her craftsmanship is apparent on this exquisite folk album. From the slightest wavering of vocals to the gentlest of brushes on the guitar pickups, Ries captures it all on the recording.
Ries tackled the album by herself on a personal retreat in Tennessee and dug deep to patch the songs together. While not as seemingly hip as Bon Iver’s Blood Bank, her recordings on the EP have a poignant delicacy that allows it to exist free from hype. In a different vein from the folk-oriented pastorals of On Laurel Lake EP Ries’ 2007 release, Without A Bird explores her relationship with the city of Chicago.
Across albums, Ries’ music constantly grapples with the tumultuous dichotomy between life in the city and life in the country. In her own words: “This life I’ve chosen felt suddenly precarious, muddled, and far too far from the source. What do we really need? Out here in the ‘real’ world I ask for so much more than family, faith, food, and shelter. So much vapor.”
While Ries’ songs are heartbreaking, they are not love songs. They speak to life — its joys and its anguish. Memories, dreams, and illusions sit beside anguished lonesomeness in Ries’ songs to create a heart-wrenchingly powerful combination.

Dear Patrick,
Last week, I played “dizzy bat” — a game that involves a hollow wiffle ball bat, spinning around in a circle, and swinging at a can tossed in your general direction — and sprained my ankle. How can I use my sprained ankle to pick up chicks?
Thanks,
Usually Not Comically Out Of Rational Decisions, I Need Anything To Ensnare Damsels
Dear UNCOORDINATED,
A sprained ankle is one of the worst injuries you can get — there’s nothing sexy about it. The only way to make this work is with the story, and your story sucks.
Instead, start telling them this story: “The other day I was walking home after volunteering at the hospital when I saw a puppy with a hurt paw trying to cross the road. Then a giant SUV came barreling down the road, and the driver didn’t notice the puppy. So I dove into the street to rescue the puppy, but I twisted my ankle in a pothole. I then delivered the puppy into the waiting arms of a little girl whose dad had just been shipped off to Afghanistan. As she clutched the puppy to her heart, she whispered, ‘Thank you, sir; you’re a real hero, just like my daddy.’ ” That story has everything liberal college girls love to get self-righteous about.
THAT story will get you laid,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I’ve heard a lot about the show Game of Thrones, and the new season just premiered. But I’m not sure if I should watch it. What do you think? Should I watch it?
Sincerely,
Too Lazy To Make An Acronym, Gonna Go Drink
Dear TLTMAAGGD,
Game of Thrones has it all: sex, incest, violence, incest, and a lot of incest. It has great acting, fantastic writing, and beautiful directing. And tasteful incest. The second season has just started, so you may have some qualms about getting into it. You should definitely watch the first season beforehand. Once you’ve finished the incest-filled first season, you can start the less-incest-filled second season. There are giant wolves, zombies, dragons, and that chick from 300.
Once you’ve become obsessed with the universe of the TV series, you can start on the books. They have all the details the show leaves out. The books are full to the brim of maps, chronologies, and incest. The writing is great, and at least 50 percent of it is descriptions of food. Plus, you’ll get to say, “The book was better.”
Plus Peter Dinklage is a boss,
Patrick Hoskins

Jurassic Park
7:30 10 12:30
Jurassic Park is a sci-fi adventure 64 million years in the making. When an eccentric billionaire and his team of scientists discover how to clone dinosaurs using ancient DNA found in mosquitos, a team of specialists is sent to endorse a theme park created around these unique attractions. Unfortunately — spoiler alert — a harmless tour ride is interrupted by a massive storm and suspicious power outage that leaves them facing a threat they never thought possible. Fun Fact: This is still director Steven Spielberg’s highest-grossing film.
The Adventures of Tintin
8 10 12
Spielberg week continues with his most recent film, released in December 2011. Based on the popular European comics that were primarily published in the ’30s, ’40s, and ’50s, The Adventures of Tintin is Spielberg’s first animated film. The film was shot entirely with 3D motion capture technology. The movie follows the adventurous reporter Tintin, his dog Snowy, and Captain Archibald Haddock as they set off on a hunt for the treasure of an old sunken ship. Fun Fact: The screenplay features the writing trio of Steven Moffatt (Doctor Who), Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz), and English comedian Joe Cornish.
No Instruments Aloud

In place of another Spielberg movie, Saturday will be filled with the sounds of five of Carnegie Mellon’s a cappella groups. No Instruments Aloud, an a cappella event hosted by The Originals, will feature performances by The Originals, Treblemakers, Counterpoint, Soundbytes, and Joyful Noise. The proceeds from the event will go toward creating a Carnegie Mellon a cappella album and an Originals album.
Saving Private Ryan
7 10 1
If you’ve never seen this film, go this Sunday if only for the epic opening sequence of the D-Day Normandy invasion. Featuring an ensemble cast including Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, and Ed Burns, the film has been called one of the greatest war movies ever made. Saving Private Ryan also nabbed Spielberg his second Best Director Academy Award. Fun Fact: Matt Damon was the only principal actor who did not go through limited Basic Training in preparation for the film, so that the other actors would feel a deeper sense of resentment towards him on camera.

Several hundred people gathered around the Fence at a rally on Monday to demand justice for Trayvon Martin. The rally was organized by Carnegie Mellon’s Black Graduate Student Organization (BGSO).
Martin, a 17-year-old African-American boy, was shot and killed last month in Florida. The admitted shooter, George Zimmerman, says that he was acting in self-defense. Under Florida’s stand-your-ground law, any level of force is justified if a person believes that his or her life is threatened. Unless it is proven that Zimmerman was not acting in self-defense, he cannot be arrested or charged.
Critics say that Florida authorities have not conducted an adequate investigation to determine whether Zimmerman acted in self-defense, and that Martin was racially profiled. Phone records show that Zimmerman, a member of his neighborhood watch, followed Martin against the express instructions of a 911 operator.
Protesters at the Fence wore hoodies — the clothing that Martin wore the day he was shot, which allegedly made Zimmerman suspicious of him — and passed out Skittles and iced tea, the items Martin had just bought from a convenience store when he died. Many carried signs that said, “I am Trayvon Martin.”
Four Carnegie Mellon students, two University of Pittsburgh students, and a local artist spoke at the rally. Vice president of the BGSO Brittany Claud, a masters’ student in Tepper School of Business and the Heinz School of Public Policy and Management, introduced the speakers and kicked off the rally.
Several of the speakers stressed the importance of demanding justice in concrete ways, such as voting in local elections. “It’s not enough to vote for a black president,” said Jennifer Saint-Preux, a Pitt law student who spoke about the legal aspect of the situation. “That is not what is going to change these laws on the books. This is a state issue.... If the only thing you’re doing is voting for your president, you’re not doing enough for your country, you’re not doing enough for your state, and you’re not doing enough for someone like Trayvon Martin. You need to be at every election. You need to take that hour and vote.”
Kimberly Ellis, a local artist who goes by the name of Doctor Goddess, stressed the same point. Ellis tied it into the story of Jordan Miles, a local African-American teenager who was beaten and stunned by three Pittsburgh policemen while walking, unarmed, through Homewood in 2010. “Laws can be changed. But you have to show up at the voting booth. And you cannot just react.... So those of you who were in high school when [Miles was beaten], you’re probably now old enough to vote. And if you’re not registered, shame on you. It’s not just about the vote. What happens is we look to President Barack Obama. We look to the feds and say, ‘Please do something,’ and you completely overlook the local community where you can actually see an impact. You can feel it. When my city councilwoman wasn’t doing what I wanted her to do, I put her out!”
Voter registration forms were available at tables beside the rally.
“I’ve been in Maryland for the last five years, but I’m moving back to Pittsburgh, so I need to register,” said James Cole, a Morgan State University student who registered at the rally. “I felt I needed to do this. I felt like they were talking to me, even though I just got back in town. It was a very informative protest.”
“I know in the black community, we feel like our vote don’t count,” said rally-goer Brandy Mangham. “Because we see all these laws that are so against us. It’s basically institutionalized racism.... I feel like I’m more empowered now. I can go back, I can share the information that I heard from the speakers that presented today, and I can tell people that we can make a difference. We cannot allow things like this to keep on happening when it is ultimately our ability to vote that can prevent it.”
Other speakers emphasized the importance of combating racism on a daily basis.
“ ‘Is this man a monster?’ is the question I ask,” said the second speaker, sophomore information systems major Christopher Lindsay. “No. Racist? Potentially, yeah. But no more than me or any one of us. I’m just as wrong when I joke about my Hispanic brothers being illegal or assume my Asian brothers know karate. I’m just as wrong when I assume a white officer is only following me or pulling up beside me because I’m black. In this way, I’m no better than George Zimmerman. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, ‘Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.’ If we desire to demand justice for Trayvon, we all must exercise justice on a personal level.”
Business and public policy and management dual master’s student Ricky Burgess, the president of the BGSO, spoke last. 
“In order to break the cycle of carnage, we must change our culture,” Burgess said. “First, we must remember, as Chris said, we are George Zimmerman too. Fundamentally, Trayvon’s death wasn’t about unjust laws or poor policing. It was about fear. Like George Zimmerman, we too often fear those who do not look, talk, act, or speak the way we do. We may not be killing innocent men in cold blood, but every day, we take small actions that perpetuate the culture that led to Trayvon’s death.... Together, let us honor Trayvon’s legacy by creating a world where he could have lived.”

The search to replace University President Jared L. Cohon, who will be stepping down on June 30, 2013, is under way.
Ray Lane, the chairman of Carnegie Mellon’s Board of Trustees, named the official search committee of 17 members in a letter published on the university’s website last February. The committee will be directed by Jim Rohr, the chairman and CEO of PNC Financial Services Group and chair of the board’s Nominating and Governance Committee.
This committee includes eight university trustees and eight faculty members in addition to Rohr. The recommendation from this committee will be submitted to the Board of Trustees for the selection of Carnegie Mellon’s next president. 
Materials science and engineering professor Anthony Rollett is a leader of the presidential search committee. He described his role as “working with basically everybody in the university to try to identify candidates.”
In a Feb. 12 message, Lane wrote, “While the committee, aided by a search firm, will lead the process and ultimately recommend a candidate to the board, every member of the university community — students, alumni, faculty and staff — will have the opportunity to participate and provide input.”
The official search timeline consists of three phases: the quiet phase, the public phase, and the final phase.
The quiet phase takes place from February to August. It consists of the proper formation and establishment of a search committee, as well as the inclusion of a firm to assist in the search. The public phase will take place from September 2012 to spring 2013, during which candidates will be sought and narrowed down to a small list. The final phase, scheduled for the spring of 2013, is when the final group of candidates will be interviewed and the search committee will make its recommendation.
The official announcement of Carnegie Mellon’s new president is expected to occur before the end of the spring 2013 semester.
In order to make the university community aware of the happenings surrounding the presidential search, and to gather public opinion on what Carnegie Mellon should look for in a new president, a series of public forums was held last week.
The student town hall was opened by Student Body President Jake Flittner, a senior mechanical engineering and engineering and public policy double major. Flittner said that “the overall purpose of this town hall is to gather information for a white paper ... and also to help the presidential search committee to find aspects and characteristics for the next president.”
The “white paper” will be drafted by the faculty committee and then used to create a job statement and description for potential candidates.
Cohon spoke at both the student and faculty town halls, but was unable to attend the staff forum. Rohr spoke in his stead.
Adam Rauf, the president of Staff Council, opened the staff forum. 
“We as the staff members are kind of like the troops on the ground, so to speak. We know all the interworking of the university. That’s why it’s so critical for us to make an impact,” Rauf said in his opening address.
Each of the three forums followed the same format: After a brief presentation on the changes in Carnegie Mellon during Cohon’s tenure, the audience contributed questions about and hopes for the next president.
Students called for a president who pays attention to research, is socially responsible, continues to improve student life, maintains financial security, and balances science and the arts within Carnegie Mellon. 
When expressing their thoughts on the traits that should be held by the new Carnegie Mellon president, responses focused on approachability and an understanding of what one student dubbed “the Carnegie Mellon spirit.”
At the staff meeting, audience members expressed concerns that some staff members, especially lower-paid employees, felt like they were struggling financially. Others pointed out that Carnegie Mellon was shy as an institution, stating that the next president needed to be a “cheerleader in chief.”
The faculty forum was opened by Irene Fonseca, a member of the presidential search committee, stating that the town hall was to “construct a shared vision of the characteristics ... we’d like to see in the next president.” 
The faculty delivered responses focused on limiting restrictions and bureaucracy within the university. They also sought a president who would better interdepartmental relations.
Mathematics professor John Mackey described his vision for the next president by saying, “We need a very aggressive, yet thoughtful person.... Our danger is becoming complacent.”
Rollett said that “no preference is being stated or discussed” as to whether the next president would come from within the university community. Regardless, one staff member did request that the next president come from outside of Carnegie Mellon. 
In addition, Rollett encouraged students to express their suggestions regarding the search either on the official website or by finding individuals related to the presidential search, whose names can be found online.
A forum for alumni will be held during Spring Carnival.

The five student body presidential candidates debated and discussed their campaign and positions last Monday in McConomy Auditorium. The debate was held by the Elections Board and The Tartan; WRCT and cmuTV sponsored and broadcast the debates.
Most of the debate questions focused on individual tickets and their platforms. For example, Amy Quispe, a junior computer science and math double major, was asked to explain her open data position.
“I promised that we would have APIs for the school data. That means that we want to have data sets open in a way such that it’s easy for people to interface with that data and to use it,” Quispe said. “I’ve worked on this problem from a tech perspective, but I’ve realized that it’s not just a technical problem; it’s a policy problem. I hope that from the talk we can start to influence administrators to open up data sets so that developers, but also other people, can use these data sets to create new things and to solve the problems in their surroundings.”
Neither junior information systems and human-computer interaction double major Brian Groudan nor his running mate, junior decision science and psychology double major Amanda Ho Sang, has held any student government position. They were asked how they would compensate for their lack of experience, and how their roles in other organizations helped them.
“We do have experience through other organizations. I don’t think that’s the biggest drawback,” Groudan said. “Through my leadership in my fraternity, I ran a huge PR game that re-branded us.... Amanda and I have had a number of leadership positions ... and so I think that we have the leadership experience that it takes to be in this position. And when you think about what the purpose of the student government is, it’s to be the voice of the people.... We’ll be strategically picking our cabinet and the people that we work with to make sure that they complement our strengths and our weaknesses.”
Senior materials science and engineering and biomedical engineering double major Matthew Biegler said that he was not in the election to win, but rather to send a message. Biegler thinks the university should incentivize the student body president to ensure that he or she accomplishes goals and initiatives.
“[Getting elected is] my worst nightmare,” Biegler said. “Honestly, I think I’ve heard a lot of compelling arguments from people saying yes and no. At this point, I’m hoping I’m not elected. But if I am, I’m not sure what I’ll do — I’ll have to cross that bridge when I get there.”
Junior information systems major Seth Vargo mentioned that the university is currently employing new fees and cuts on alumni donations, specifically mentioning the central administration fee which was introduced last year. The fee began, Vargo said, at about 4 percent, and will peak at 9.6 percent.
“I think it’s time that we start asking the university to give back,” Vargo said. “If they’re going to start levying 10 percent taxes, I feel like we have another Boston Tea Party on our hands. And I think that, as students, it’s our responsibility to be civil, not hostile, like the Boston Tea Party, and start asking the university to give back to us.”
Vargo said that a way the university could give back was to pay for the security cost of Carnival, such as paying for the police officers. This, Vargo said, would severely cut the costs students have to pay.
As the chair of Undergraduate Student Senate, junior economics and statistics and decision science double major Will Weiner has been highly involved with transportation.
“This depends on what happens with Port Authority. My biggest thing is reaction area,” Weiner said, speaking on how he would stay involved in the issue. “My involvement here has been making sure that what I feel are the vital services to the university stay here.... I have established the connections to make sure that stuff like the buses stay intact.... That being said, if everything goes fine, the busses are safe, then it’s up to us to go to our feedback collection to see what the people want.”
The audience also had the chance to ask questions. One audience member asked for each ticket to name three organizations neither of them had been in, and one that currently didn’t exist but that they wished to see made.
“None of them mentioned media organizations. That was something that was interesting to me,” said Matthew Baron, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering and Hispanic studies double major.
“I think that [the debate is] the same kind of thing every year, with varying experience amongst candidates,” said Turi Alcoser, a senior materials science and engineering major. “If experience will be the deciding factor, then that’s not enough. But I still think they did well and I don’t have anything against them.”
Voting opened on Saturday and will close on Tuesday.
The 2012 student body presidential debates can be viewed online on cmuTV's youtube channel.

Student Body President Jake Flittner is happy to be back to work.
On Feb. 23, the Undergraduate Student Senate voted to begin impeachment proceedings against Flittner, a senior mechanical engineering and engineering and public policy double major. For three weeks, he was constitutionally prohibited from performing any of his presidential duties. Last week, when the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) failed to reach quorum at a joint meeting to vote on the matter, the motion expired, and Flittner was reinstated as president.
One of the rationales that Senators who moved to impeach Flittner gave was that he had failed to carry out his constitutional duties, but Flittner maintains that he performed those and more. Among other complaints, some Senators accused Flittner of not attending or sending a representative to every Student Senate meeting, which he is constitutionally required to do.
“For the course of this whole year, between myself and [Student Body Vice President Sangita Sharma], we’ve gone to basically every meeting,” Flittner said. “Have there been one or two that, just because of schedule conflicts, we haven’t been able to make? Yeah. [But] we’ve been in the upper 90 percents. I believe there’s been one or two one of us hasn’t been there for. First semester, I went to most of the meetings, and then second semester, Sangita’s been going to almost all of the meetings.”
Flittner does not believe that one or two missed meetings over the course of a year constitute a failure of duty.
“I ask myself the question, ‘Why is going to Senate, why is going to GSA in the actual constitution?’ Well, if you look at my actual powers, I have the ability to veto. So if there’s any sort of motion that goes through Senate, I have the power to veto that motion. I think that it’s important for myself to know what is going on in the actual Senate meetings. And I think that that has been completed from either Sangita or myself going to the meetings, as well as through our conversations in [Executive Committee meetings].”
In addition to his constitutional duties, Flittner says that he has done considerable work on the platform on which he was elected, which he claims is more detailed and comprehensive than previous presidents’ have been.
The pillars of Flittner’s campaign platform were community building; government relations; health and safety; transparency; and previous initiatives. Specific initiatives included promoting healthy eating; introducing a campus diversity honors program; revamping Parents’ Weekend; increasing governmental transparency; evaluating and improving escort and shuttle services; developing a cab service for Carnegie Mellon students, called Tartan Taxi; and introducing Friday Frenzies, a series of small campus celebrations on the four Fridays leading up to Carnival.
Flittner asserts that he succeeded entirely at some of the intitiatives, such as Friday Frenzies and healthy eating. The first Friday Frenzy occurred last Friday, and two more are scheduled to take place this week and next. Flittner said that other initiatives, such as the overhaul of Parents’ Weekend, were accomplished independently by the university administration or other bodies. In those cases, Flittner said that he lent support where possible.
In the cases of the diversity honors program and the Tartan Taxi, Flittner said that he simply discovered, after working to put them into place, that they were not possible. Tartan Taxi, he said, was a program similar to those that other universities have implemented. But for legal reasons, he discovered that Carnegie Mellon could not implement its own cab system, and no Pittsburgh cab companies were interested in the project.
Similarly, Flittner said that the only way to implement the diversity honors program would have been to make it a course, which he feels would have violated the spirit of what he and Sharma were trying to achieve. Sometimes, he said, you just don’t know what will work until you try.
“Platforms are a promise to work on issues. A lot of these issues that you come up with, it’s not a question of, ‘You should have known that you can’t do this.’ You don’t know until you really start getting into that process. After a lot of work, that’s when you find out this can work or this can’t work.... And I think that ‘want to try,’ ‘want to have happen,’ is maybe where there’s a miscommunication between candidates and the student body, where somebody thinks, ‘If I vote for Jake, there will be a Tartan Taxi.’ That’s not what we said. It was, ‘We want to try to have a Tartan Taxi, so we’re going to work on trying to get it. Will it happen? I can’t tell you for sure, because I haven’t started working on the project.’ ”
Despite the work that Flittner says he and Sharma have done during their term, there is one area of his platform in which he admits failure: transparency. “[Student government transparency] is one thing I don’t think that we’ve done to where we’d like to. I’ll admit that. We put it as a lower priority ... because our main focus was trying to get initiatives done. That’s kind of how we focused. And in the process, we made it so that we weren’t as transparent as we’d like to be. We pretty much just followed previous precedents that were put in front of us. And I think this is something that, when leaving office, we’re really going to push to other future presidents that this is something that should be made a high priority.”
In fact, Flittner hopes that increased transparency will be one of the byproducts of the motion to impeach him. Currently, he said, each president improves in small ways on the job that previous presidents did. But, Flittner said, the impeachment process has allowed for student government to have a conversation about what the role of the president should be. His hope is that the next president will be able to improve in big ways because of that conversation.
He pointed to one constitutional duty of the president that he believes to be the most important: “Facilitate representation of the student body throughout Carnegie Mellon University’s Pittsburgh campus.” This is the line that Flittner says is responsible for the way that the role of the president develops.
“It is abstract,” Flittner said. “It’s designed to be that way ... So that you can have some fluidity in your actual presidents. So you can have different styles of presidents.”
Ideally, Flittner said, future presidents will be transparent with the student body. In the best of all possible worlds, the president would speak directly with the student body on a regular basis, to get ideas from them and to share what he or she has been doing. But in order for future presidents to really communicate with the student body, Flittner says that the student body has to change as well.
“I would like to see a lot more student body support,” Flittner said. “Right now, for instance, if I try to have a town hall, the town halls that I’ve tried to have, you get a few people show up.... When I held my town halls, I had 20 people at a town hall, and that was a success. Because students are so busy here.... So if you have a more open-dialogue culture, I think it would allow for an ideal president to be able to really be out there in the campus community, really be out there having larger town halls, having larger addresses, having larger open communication with all of campus.”
As for how to create such a culture, Flittner said that the changes have already started to happen. The key, he said, is patience. “I think it’s something that has been developing. It’s a process. You can’t just flip a switch. You just have to slowly develop your community and develop your relationship with that community by doing projects and just trying to make campus better.”

The candidates for Vice President for Organizations (VPO) and Vice President for Finance (VPF) debated in Rashid Auditorium last Tuesday. The debates, which were more lightly attended than Monday’s student body president and vice president debates, were held by the Elections Board and The Tartan. WRCT and cmuTV sponsored and broadcast the debates.
Junior lighting design major and longtime member of student government Jon Mark is running unopposed in the race for the position of VPF. “I understand that, pending the greatest write-in campaign in history, this is pretty much in the bag for me, but I feel I should be held to the same standards as other politicians,” Mark said.
The key points Mark made in his platform were a 20 percent increase in the student activities fee, raising it from $95 to about $114, and encouraging resource sharing between similar clubs when merging is not possible. He also said that he would like to provide audits to any club that makes a reasonable request, and make the value and power of the position of VPF more readily apparent so the position may attract future contenders.
After Mark finished answering audience questions, sophomore electric and computer engineering major Alyssa Danesh and sophomore business administration and decision science double major Rishi Patel took the stage. Danesh and Patel are campaigning for the position of VPO, a position within student government which works alongside the VPF to manage student organizations on campus.
“We don’t have enough money or space,” Patel said in his opening statement. “Raising the [student activities fee] should be a last resort.” Patel believes that before raising the fee, three actions need to be taken by the VPO: Encouraging campus organizations to appeal to their alumni for additional funds; promoting collaboration between related organizations through more meetings; and increasing efficiency by making students aware of CollegiateLink, a service which will soon replace OrgTracker and BudgetTracker.
Danesh said her focus as VPO would be on creating a third tier of organizations with official campus recognition but no funding, and creating a wiki with information on the forms needed to start and run a campus organization. She said that she would make clarity the overall goal of her term. Danesh cited her experience as the Committee on Student Organizations’ chair of recognition this past term.
Voting for the VPO and VPF positions began on Saturday and will close on Tuesday.

Professor awarded grant for study of hybrid materials
The National Science Foundation has awarded Carnegie Mellon mechanical engineering professor Jonathan Malen an Early Career Development Award.
The award will give Malen $400,000 over the next five years to study organic-inorganic hybrid materials. These materials combine the properties of superconductors with the scalability of plastics. Malen’s research uses laser-based technologies to study photon transport.
“I’m extremely pleased with this award because it will fuel my experimental studies of how energy in the form of heat is transferred through organic-inorganic hybrid materials,” Malen said in a university press release. 
This is not Malen’s first research award. Malen previously received the Air Force Office of Scientific Research Young Investigator Award. In 2011, Malen received the Petroleum Research Fund Doctoral New Investigator Award from the American Chemical Society.
In addition to his work with organic-inorganic hybrid materials, Malen is currently working on a “Phonon-Simulator,” an educational initiative to teach the origins of heat transfer in Pittsburgh public schools.
“The local focus will be under-represented pre-college students from PPS as well as students at Carnegie Mellon,” Malen said in the press release.
Secretary of Transportation names professor to ITSPAC
Ray LaHood, the U.S. secretary of transportation, has named Carnegie Mellon electrical and computer engineering professor Raj Rajkumar to the Intelligent Systems Program Advisory Committee (ITSPAC).
“This is a great honor for me as my research team works to develop and implement technologies for improving the safety and efficiency of transportation,” Rajkumar said in a university press release.
ITSPAC advises the secretary of transportation on the study and development of intelligent U.S. transportation systems. 
Members of the committee make recommendations about which proposed areas of intelligent systems research should be funded and by whom.
Rajkumar is an expert in smart systems for vehicles and highways. He is currently doing work in vehicular information technologies, autonomous vehicles that drive themselves, and vehicular networks.
“State-of-the-art computing and communication technologies can significantly advance the safety and efficiency of transportation, since extending the physical infrastructure is both expensive and limited by existing road layouts,” Rajkumar said in the press release.

Umut A. Acar, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, will deliver a lecture titled “Greedy Sharing: Scheduling on Weakly Consistent Memory.” 
Acar will present the recent unpublished results of his and his collaborators’ work on “greedy sharing,” a new algorithm for load balancing on processors with weakly consistent memory.
The algorithm relies on work-sharing, which results in synchronization. Acar will present experiments which show that the algorithm is practical, and discuss future research directions.
Philosophy Colloquium: Branden Fitelson
Thursday at 4:45 p.m.
Baker Hall A53
Branden Fitelson, a professor of philosophy at Rutgers University, will deliver a lecture titled “Accuracy, Coherence, and Evidence,” based on his and his collaborator’s work. 
Fitelson will briefly discuss the traditionally accepted accuracy, coherence, and evidentiary norms for full belief, as well as the Ramsey-style reasoning that one should be skeptical of analogous norms for partial belief. 
He will then describe alternative accuracy and coherency norms for partial belief, and the ways in which analogous norms for full belief lead to a new coherence norm that is weaker than deductive consistency.

Many people know about Trayvon Martin, the 17-year-old boy who was shot and killed in Florida by a neighborhood guard named George Zimmerman on Feb. 26. Zimmerman chased down Martin, who had nothing on him but a bag of Skittles and an iced tea, and killed him after the boy allegedly begged for his life. Zimmerman wasn’t arrested because he claims that he felt threatened, which allowed him to use excessive force to defend himself under Florida’s stand-your-ground law.
This tragedy has sparked a reaction to the injustice done to a boy whose only crime seemed to be wearing a hoodie and being African-American.
Although it is encouraging that many people are outraged by the injustice, the incident raises a deeper issue that cannot be overlooked. This shooting was a hate crime, not a misunderstanding. 
It was not because of what Martin was wearing. It was because he fit a certain profile that society identifies as menacing.
According to reports, Martin was not sporting any gang tattoos, flags, or showing any signs of being a menace. He was wearing a hoodie — the same kind of hoodie many people buy from the Carnegie Mellon bookstore. The only other physical factor that could have set off an alarm in Zimmerman’s mind was the boy’s race. Sadly, he fit the racial profile that many people associate with crime and other negative actions.
Many people agree that this was an act of racism. The fact that racism is still prominent to such an extent is a challenging issue, but there is a far more complex problem at hand.
The internal issue behind this tragedy is that our society has become blind to many forms of racism. Just because segregation is now illegal does not mean that social stigmas have disappeared. Yet many people claim that racism is no longer an issue in our country. 
Because of this, racism has been allowed to root itself in our society through people’s mindset toward minorities. Contempt toward another race does not have to manifest itself in the form of killing, as it did in the case of Martin. The negative beliefs that people harbor about African-Americans and other minorities are apparent in the way people behave and talk.
I came across something very disconcerting shortly after the Martin incident. There were some angry and racist remarks on Twitter due to the fact that one of the main characters in the movie The Hunger Games was a black girl. These harmful comments show something very disappointing about the beliefs being passed on to youths about race. 
These comments suggest that the character was somehow inferior to their expectations because of her race. This subtle kind of racism is damaging to the image of minorities and has been allowed to hide for too long under the guise of jokes and words such as “Not to be racist, but....”
This is the kind of mindset that led to Martin’s death. The fact that something like this still happens shows how stereotypes are dangerously potent. Zimmerman saw Martin as inferior because of his appearance. He did not think that Martin’s life was valuable, so he shot him on the spot without reasonable cause.
America cannot let Martin’s death fade away. It was not self-defense; Martin was not going to beat Zimmerman to death with his bag of Skittles.
The fact that Zimmerman was not immediately arrested is a slap in the face to minorities in America. If there is any justice in America, this man will be punished for what he did and because of his bigotry.
An incident like this gives our youth a chance to uproot racism and fight back against hatred, a chance to create a better and more united America for posterity.

For the past two years, The Tartan has refrained from endorsing a candidate for student body president. This year, because we are not entirely supportive of any one platform, we choose to do the same. There is an unprecedented number of presidential candidates running, and each ticket has certain ideas that sound relevant and feasible. We review each ticket and their ideas below.
Quispe and Wade
Presidential candidate Amy Quispe and vice presidential candidate Bryan Wade seem primarily concerned with their Open Data initiative and the reformation of the Committee on Student Organizations (CoSO) into a two-tiered process. The idea to reform CoSO in a way that separates student organization recognition and JFC funding may result in the creation of a lot of similar clubs, thus forcing these similar organizations to fight for members.
The Open Data initiative is a realistic goal; its focus is on opening up more opportunities and tools for students to be creative and approach community problems. This initiative could have an immediate effect on the entirety of campus, not just those involved in student organizations.
Weiner and Dudley
Presidential candidate Will Weiner and vice presidential candidate Meela Dudley have a plethora of initiatives, with a majority of them falling under the categories of public relations or event attendance. Public relations and greater visibility on campus can easily be introduced, and could be a great success, if the candidates continue to publicize and update their website as well as advertise in more physical ways on campus.
The initiatives geared towards event attendance, such as town hall meetings, attempt to address the more intangible problem of apathy in the student body. There is no cut and dry solution to this problem, and the success of the initiatives created to address it depend on increased visibility, event interest, timing, and community collaboration.
Vargo and Frick
Presidential candidate Seth Vargo and vice presidential candidate Joe Frick are running on a platform geared towards unifying what they see as a divided campus. Their ideas to extend DineX to include more off-campus locations and make Entropy+ accept meal blocks are interesting ones.
The idea to secure additional contributions from the university for campus-wide events like Spring Carnival seems to be a well-thought-out goal. Especially in the case of Carnival, an excellent public relations and alumni event, it seems that it would behoove the university to invest in student events in terms of advertising and in terms of donations.
Groudan and Ho Sang
Presidential candidate Brian Groudan and vice presidential candidate Amanda Ho Sang are also promoting a diverse set of initiatives in their platform.
Some, like the transformation of the space underneath the Pausch bridge into a recreational area and the increase in outdoor seating, seem doable. Others initiatives, like the airport shuttle, would be extremely difficult to accomplish and are already being addressed (or, in the case of the shuttle, will be addressed if the 28X bus is cut) by the university.
Biegler and Friedman
Presidential candidate Matthew Biegler and vice presidential candidate Amy Friedman ran on a scattered platform, admitted by Biegler to be a joke campaign. The campaign critiques the effectiveness and efficiency of student government.
We are glad that all candidates stressed a need to increase visibility of student government initiatives on campus and emphasized collaboration within the community to accomplish their goals.
We are hopeful that — whichever ticket is elected — they will focus on solving the most prevalent problems on campus, set realistic and concrete goals, and above all continue to increase communication and visibility on campus.

This letter is a written response to The Tartan’s March 26 Forum article titled “Dudley should not be elected SBVP” and the 122 online comments it received.
Students, Teachers, Faculty, Peers:
First and foremost I would like to thank all of you for your unending support this past week.
I have written a response to last week’s Tartan article “Dudley should not be elected SBVP” but due to certain length restraints involving letters to the editor, I have chosen to publish my response on Will and my’s campaign site, www.WeinerDudley2012.com. 
I spent a lot of time on my response and sought out advice from many of my peers and advisors, and because of this I am of the opinion that the letter should only be read in its entirety.
I urge all who are interested to please visit our campaign site to read my response and I thank all of the Tartan readers for understanding this decision.
Will and I wish the best to all of the candidates running in this year’s election and we look forward to hearing the results.
Meela Dudley
SBVP Candidate

As alumni and former members of the Tartan’s editorial staff, we were shocked to see an article, “Dudley should not be elected SBVP,” disparaging a Carnegie Mellon student in last week’s Forum. By publishing this article, The Tartan’s leadership has shown a remarkable lack of judgment and has distanced itself from the university community.
When we were members of the editorial staff, we debated about whether to endorse a particular presidential ticket. While we eventually decided to publish an endorsement, the student body was unhappy with our decision, and that is not something to take lightly. The Tartan’s job, as Carnegie Mellon’s student newspaper, is to serve the students and the larger university community.
This piece not only fails to consider the community, but also fails to give Dudley a chance to respond. It fails in professionalism, tact, and collegiality. The Tartan should not publish its negative opinions of former staffers’ performance. The writers note at the beginning of their article that the Tartan typically does not publish stories about itself — there is a reason for this. The Tartan’s job is to report news, not make it.
The opinions of the writers may be valid, but the appropriate forum for these opinions is not in the newspaper, which can never be erased. Rather, they should have taken their concerns to the debates, where Dudley would have a chance to respond and explain the circumstances of her alleged failures, and how she could overcome the challenges that faced her while she held that position.
While we don’t know the details of Dudley’s experience at The Tartan, we do know that the top leadership positions of The Tartan frequently come attached with unrealistic expectations and nasty internal politics. Dudley’s alleged failures as Publisher may not accurately reflect her leadership potential and, in any case, should not be the sole criterion used to judge whether she is qualified for future positions.
Everyone makes mistakes, but most people learn from their mistakes. We’re sure that Dudley has learned from hers, and can only hope that The Tartan learns from its mistakes as well.

President Barack Obama announced further oil sanctions on Iran last Saturday, hoping to put a dent in Iran’s ever-present nuclear program.
“There is a sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran to permit a significant reduction in the volume of petroleum and petroleum products purchased from Iran by or through foreign financial institutions,” Obama said. The sanctions would be implemented in three months and would show their effects a few months later.
What Obama failed to mention, however, is the historical lack of success of sanctions on Iran.
Since the 1920s, sanctions led by the United Nations on the Iranian economy have been minimally effective. The objective of chipping away at Iran’s nuclear facilities is far from being reached.
Iran’s President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad stated his intentions in 2008 to “wipe Israel off the map” if Iran were to acquire nuclear weapons. Israel and the United States continually press the notion that a nuclear-viable Iran is not just a threat to Israel, but a global threat. The issue has heated up this year, with constant talk about a potential Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities in the coming months.
As Israeli journalist Merav Batito put it in an article for Ynetnews.com, “Economic sanctions are a superb solution for those who believe in the basic principles of democracy, such as accountability to one’s citizens, the holding of free elections and guaranteeing the basic right of human beings to make a living, speak up, or just express their views openly.” The Islamic Republic of Iran is not that kind of state and will not react to further sanctions. All past sanctions on Iran have proven to raise oil prices, instead of deteriorating Iran’s nuclear program. There is no sense behind the belief that further sanctions, especially at the highest point in Iran’s nuclear developments, will work.
The only thing that is missing, in this heap of policies and reactions to Iranian nuclear advancements, is any trust in Israel’s ability to act. “We are no longer that same old herd being led to the slaughter, as was the case in the early part of the 20th century. We have progressed a little since then; we also acquired some weapons during that time,” Israeli journalist Hagai Segal stated on Ynetnews.com, in response to doubts about Israel’s ability to effectively attack Iran. Increased belief and support in Israel’s defensive capabilities are more important than the historically disproved sanctions route.
Diplomatic negotiations have never worked with the Khamenei-Ahmadinejad government, and they never will work. Just as Iran has a window of opportunity for negotiations, Israel has a window of opportunity for beginning its militaristic approach. If Israel wants to impact Iran’s nuclear facilities effectively, it needs to do so in the coming months.
“Nip it in the bud” is an appropriate phrase, and whether this comes in the form of an Israeli offensive or a joint American-allied offensive is yet to be seen. 
What is certain, however, is that sanctions are passive and have been proven ineffective against this type of regime.

I would like to take a minute to respond to the article in last week’s Tartan which criticized the Student Senate for not “commit[ting] to reforming itself,” citing the impeachment of the student body president as the only supporting evidence. For The Tartan to say, “The situation shows how Student Senate has been unable to follow through on initiatives that would benefit the student body,” its editorial board is undermining every other initiative Senate has completed with great success this year.
Examples include: an unprecedented $14,000 allocation from the senate operating reserve to AB Concerts, which made this year’s artist selection (Passion Pit) possible; substantial changes to 76-101 (Interpretation and Argument) that will be seen next year; a new sound system in Kirr Commons; and the overhaul of the University Center game room that is currently under way. For more information, come to a regular meeting at 5 p.m. on Thursdays in Margaret Morrison 103 for committee reports. They typically last until 5:20 p.m.
As for the impeachment, if the Graduate Student Assembly had maintained quorum and the vote had been legal, the end result would still have been that Senate voted by a slight margin not to remove Jake from office. 
Regardless of my views, I support the independent thinking of my peers, and the open discourse that led to that decision.
So instead of criticizing Senate for not blindly rubber-stamping the removal of an executive officer without considering his/her defense, I think The Tartan should be commending every elected official who took the time to attend the hearing, listen to the facts, and reach the decision they felt was best. That is the job of an elected official, and I applaud every Senator for fulfilling their duty to this process with aplomb.
Student government has spent enough time focusing on this impeachment. It is time to focus our efforts back on other important issues, and work with the executive branch to end the year on a positive note. I look forward to seeing what else Jake and Sangita will do with the remaining weeks of the semester.

According to an article published in The Huffington Post, Colorado Springs canceled its annual Easter Egg Hunt due to too much anticipated parental intervention.
Ideally, kids participating in the hunt search around Bancroft Park for plastic eggs containing candy while parents sit back and watch from behind a gate. In recent years, however, parents have broken the rules and have started jumping the gate to help their children find eggs.
Since bringing parents into an Easter Egg Hunt is like dropping an atomic bomb — not only does it make things end in seconds, but it starts an arms race — the organizers decided to cancel this year’s hunt, much to the dismay of children and rule-abiding parents.
Regardless of whether the hunt was canceled or not, interfering parents are depriving their children of important lessons and life experiences.
I can understand what motivates these interfering parents, particularly those of toddlers and smaller kids, to break the rules. The Easter Egg Hunt itself isn’t fair. The older, bigger, and more aggressive kids have an advantage over other children, and there’s a good chance that some kids might not get any candy without parental intervention. It’s not like the bigger or more aggressive kids deserve the candy more than their smaller and more timid peers, so the egg hunt is not fair. Nobody knows this better, and is more outraged by the unfairness, than the parents of a child who went home without any candy.
If the goal of the egg hunt is just to give out free candy to kids, then parents would have good reason to jump the fence and grab up the candy. But aren’t there better solutions? If candy were the only goal, the best solution would be to distribute the candy equally amongst all the children and cancel the hunt. Or if you wanted to keep the hunt, why not have all the candy the children find go into a collective pot which would be divided evenly at the end amongst all the children?
While all of the above might make the egg hunt more equitable, even the interfering parents at Colorado Springs would balk at the idea of a collective pot because the hunt and its competitive nature is part of the town’s tradition; preserving such a tradition has some value.
The unfortunate part is that the competitive nature of the Easter Egg Hunt tradition primarily benefits the children, and parental intervention deprives them of that benefit.
If nothing else, the hunt teaches kids that life isn’t always fair and that there will be times when you try your hardest but you won’t succeed. It’s obvious now, but for many of us when we were younger, it was counter-intuitive. Of course, the sooner we realized that we would never be astronauts or sports stars, the sooner we were able to move on and tackle the real challenges in life we had been ignoring. Hopefully for most of us, this moment came long before we entered Carnegie Mellon, so we didn’t have an existential crisis when, even after pulling two all-nighters, we didn’t earn a good grade on an exam. There are no A’s for effort in life.
By sheltering their kids from failure, the aggressive parents at the Easter Egg Hunt at Colorado Springs are setting their children up for disappointment and disillusionment later in life. And for what, just candy? It’s not worth it.

Trayvon Martin, an African-American teenager in Florida, was shot and killed unarmed last month by George Zimmerman, a man whose mother is from Peru and whose father is white. Zimmerman claims self-defense; Martin’s family argues it was a racially motivated murder. To make matters more complicated, Zimmerman was not arrested after the incident and still remains free today. 
This gives the impression to many that local government either didn’t care or didn’t do its job in an unbiased manner.
We support investigation into Martin’s death and protests to inspire police reform and racial equality. We especially support Carnegie Mellon’s participation in the “Rally for Justice for Trayvon Martin” protest at the Fence last Monday, sponsored by Carnegie Mellon’s Black Graduate Student Organization.
The rally was a great example of ability of the Carnegie Mellon community to come together in a show of activism. Educational institutions are often instrumental in fostering ideas and movements, and university settings are an apt practice ground for the movements to make policy changes.
The protest at the Fence was well attended, primarily by non-Carnegie Mellon students. 
However, it may make students reconsider Carnegie Mellon’s role in shaping local response to national controversies. Pittsburgh’s racial history is not spotless; it involves continuing deep rejection, fear, and avoidance of other races. We should actively promote interracial relations.
We should take Martin’s death as an opportunity to help shape our world to prevent future tragedies, as well as to foster community activism on campus.
