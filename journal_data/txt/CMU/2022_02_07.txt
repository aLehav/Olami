This is Penalty Shouts, The Tartan’s sports column inspired by the New Yorker’s column, Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled column will focus on anything and everything funny in the sports world that is deserving of our comedic attention.
The Cold War might be over in name, but tensions between Americans and Russians seem alive and well on the ice of the Capital Indoor Stadium at the 2022 Beijing Olympics.
During the six minutes allotted for warmups ahead of the rhythm dance portion of the figure skating team event last Friday, American pair Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue suffered a near-collision with Russian Olympic Committee pair Victoria Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov. Despite NBC commentator and 2006 Olympic ice dance silver medalist Tanith White stating, “It’s really no one’s fault,” playing back the video of the incident makes it obvious that one of the pairs can very clearly be deemed the aggressor.
Clearly, the Russian pair, who were practicing their elements, should have taken more measures to avoid the American pair, who were performing the critical task of meandering around the rink together. Sure, the forward-facing Hubbell and Donohue could have given their opponents a wider berth, but why should they be expected to do that when everyone knows it’s up to the backward-traveling skaters to watch where they’re going? When Katsalapov turned to look behind him in the half-second before the near-collision, he should have pulled Sinitsina closer to him. Thank goodness the American athletes were watching their competitors the entire time and had the good sense to shift a whole four inches to the right.
Some viewers may have noticed that Donohue made contact with Sinitsina. This, of course, was just an inevitable coincidence — an innocuous, chance touch, and nothing more. Never mind Donohue rotating his wrist 180 degrees and spreading his hand to brush against Sinitsina’s backside; that’s obviously just the natural reaction to passing someone in a tight space. For all we know, he was probably being gentlemanly and supporting her in case she fell after they impeded her line. Donohue even had the good sense not to turn around and apologize. After all, he was clearly not at fault in this situation, and that sort of fraternization would distract from the all-important task of casually leading Hubbell around the rink.
As for Madison Hubbell? Why, that smirk she had after the near-collision was just a trick of the light — a distortion by the camera lens. That was clearly just a gentle smile of relief that she gave when she realized nobody had been hurt in the incident. It is in no way resembled a smug mean-girl expression of having successfully impeded their competitors and having gotten away with it. It in no way was an expression of, “That’s right; screw you. What are you going to do about it?” Such claims are simply absurd. It’s not like she was staring down the unassuming Russian pair leading up to the near-collision with a sense of spiteful superiority or anything like that.
Like White said, “it’s hard to predict where each team is heading.” Since the Russian pair was still a good two to three yards away from the wall, they definitely should have skated closer to it to give the incoming American pair more space. Good on Hubbell and Donohue for carefully watching and analyzing the trajectory of Sinitsina and Katsalapov to avoid a head-on collision. As two-time Olympian and NBC commentator Johnny Weir said regarding the incident, “you can’t ever show fear out there on an ice dance warmup, it’s all about dominance.” Clearly, the American pair were successful in doing so, making it clear that the ice belonged only to them and not any of the other four pairs warming up concurrently. This truly is an instance of sportsmanship at its absolute finest.

The Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) concluded last Sunday, and it would be an understatement to say that the latter half of the playoff portion of the competition did not disappoint.
Senegal kicked off their match against Burkina Faso and quickly went on the offensive, recording their first shot on target within 20 minutes. However, both sides displayed some sluggishness, with neither side able to put much power behind their early shots. Burkina Faso was put in a less-than-ideal situation when goalkeeper Hervé Koffi had to be taken out of the game after a collision with Cheikhou Kouyaté resulted in the latter falling on top of the former. Koffi was replaced by Farid Ouédraogo, who did well to keep Senegal at bay, and the two countries went into halftime in a 0-0 deadlock.
A Senegalese corner kick in the 70th minute led to a scramble in the box, with the ball eventually falling to Abdou Diallo, who slotted it into the bottom left corner of the net to make it 1-0 to Senegal. Some beautiful footwork by Mané coupled with a well-timed finish by Bamba Dieng then doubled Senegal’s lead in the 76th minute. Six minutes later, Blati Touré put a well-placed cross by Issa Kaboré into the back of the net to give Burkina Faso a ray of hope, but this was quickly extinguished when a Senegalese counterattack saw Sadio Mané chip the ball past Ouédraogo. With a decisive 3-1 victory, Senegal qualified for the AFCON final.
The match between Egypt and Cameroon started much more fervently, with several strong efforts by Cameroon all denied by Mohamed Abou Gabal. Like the other semifinal match, however, neither team was able to capitalize before halftime. Unlike the other semifinal match, the game remained goalless through the rest of regular time, as well as added time. Mohamed Salah’s run in the 56th minute was stopped by a fantastic tackle by André Onana, and James Léa Siliki’s long-range shot in the 91st minute landed on top of the net.
Both teams started the penalty shootout strong, converting their first opportunities from the spot, but Cameroon’s Harold Moukoudi sent the ball too close to Gabaski after a stunted run-up, and Egypt took the lead. Gabaski then predicted correctly on Siliki’s attempt to increase Egypt’s lead, and a subsequent miss by Clinton N’Jie sent Egypt through to the AFCON finals to face Senegal.
The match for third place turned out to be a thrilling roller coaster ride. Out of all the previous knockout-phase matches, the total number of goals scored during normal and extra time had never exceeded four in a single match, which made this six-goal (not counting penalties) game particularly exhilarating. Cameroon started strong, forcing Ouédraogo to make a stunning double-save in the 18th minute. Burkina Faso fought back, however, and Steeve Yago got on the end of a cross by Kaboré to make it 1-0. Things went from bad to worse for Cameroon when a subsequent Kaboré cross deflected off the arm of Onana into the back of his own net, making it 2-0 to Burkina Faso heading into halftime.
Burkina Faso extended their lead shortly into the second half. Djibril Ouattara got on the end of a precise cross by Bertrand Traoré to give Burkina Faso a three-goal lead with 49 minutes played. It wasn’t over for Cameroon, however. A scramble in the box following a Cameroonian corner in the 71st minute led to Stéphane Bahoken putting the ball in the back of the net to give the hosts their first goal of the night. Cameroon kept the pressure up, and after two close shots, Vincent Aboubakar capitalized off another corner, rising above his defender to make it 3-2 with just over five minutes left of regular time. Scarcely two minutes later, in the 87th minute, a fumble by Ouédraogo gave Aboubakar the chance to complete his brace and, completing the hosts’ comeback and drawing Cameroon level with Burkina Faso at 3-3. Neither team was able to make headway during extra time, forcing the match to go to penalties.
Both Cameroon and Burkina Faso scored their first two penalties without issue, but Onana predicted correctly on the third penalty to deny Blati Touré, giving Cameroon the lead. Yago converted his penalty without issue, but it was too little, too late, and Ambroise Oyongo put the ball into the back of the net to win the match for Cameroon, completing a sensational comeback and earning the hosts a podium position.
The final of the 2022 AFCON between Egypt and Senegal began sensationally, with a poorly-timed challenge by Mohamed Abdelmonem gifting Senegal an opportunity to convert from the spot with less than five minutes on the clock. However, Mané’s effort proved not to be enough, and Gabaski put up a solid save to prevent Senegal from taking the lead. From there, Egypt took on a slower-paced, defensive approach, and it seemed to work out for them. Despite Senegal playing well and putting up nearly double the number of Egypt’s shots and nearly triple the number of shots on target, they seemed unable to capitalize. From regular time through extra time, it seemed as if Egypt was intent on playing relatively deep into their own half and taking the match to penalties.
Ultimately, however, this strategy backfired. Egypt was unable to make the most of the limited opportunities they did have during regular time and extra time, and the penalty shootout didn’t go their way either. Both teams converted their first penalties, but Abdelmonem hit the post, allowing Senegal to take the lead. Senegal failed to capitalize, however, with Ismaïla Sarr’s mediocre effort being saved by Gabaski. Ahmed Hamdi then beat Mendy to bring Egypt level. Egypt’s relief was short-lived, however, as Dieng converted from the spot for Senegal and Mohanad Lasheen’s effort was saved by Mendy. Mané then confidently put a fourth penalty into the net for Senegal, winning Senegal’s first-ever African Cup of Nations.
After nearly a month of sweat and toil, adrenaline and devastation, the 2022 AFCON came to its conclusion in truly spectacular fashion. Senegal, after losing the 2019 AFCON to Algeria by a single goal, turned around to make history in the best possible way, denying AFCON giants Egypt to claim their very first continental title.

After a whole football season, it’s time for the Super Bowl.
To get to the big game, the Cincinnati Bengals and Los Angeles Rams had to survive the slugfest of the playoffs. This year’s playoffs were touted by the NFL in advance as the best, coming on the heels of the league’s expansion of the playoff tournament from 12 teams to 14. This resulted in one extra team making the playoffs from each conference, and as such, an extra wild-card round game for both conferences as well.
And the wild-card round was… a dud.
Only two first-round games were decided by a touchdown or less: the Bengals’ 26-19 win over the Las Vegas Raiders and the San Francisco 49ers’ 23-17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. The first was a captivating game. The Bengals had a 14-point lead shortly before halftime, but by the end of the game, the Raiders had charged down to the Bengals’ nine-yard-line with just ticks on the clock and a seven-point deficit. But, alas, they did nothing with it. Raiders quarterback Derek Carr spiked the ball on first down, threw two incomplete pass, then threw a game-sealing interception on fourth down to end the game and send the Bengals to the divisional round. The other game went down similarly. Going into the fourth quarter, the 49ers led by 16, but two Dallas scores brought the Cowboys within six. With the ball at the 49ers’ 41 with 14 seconds left, quarterback Dak Prescott found a hole up the middle and made it to the 49ers’ 24-yard-line. But a communication error on the Cowboys’ end stopped the referee from reaching the football to spot it, and while Prescott tried to spike it, the ball hit the ground with the clock reading all zeroes. Game over. As for the other four games, all were decided by multiple touchdowns.
The divisional round more than made up for a lackluster first round. All four games in the divisional round — all four! — were won on last-second field goals, except for a thriller that took overtime to settle. The Bengals beat the Tennessee Titans 19-16, and the 49ers beat the Green Bay Packers 13-10 in frigid temperatures. The Rams looked like they’d snap the streak, putting up a 27-3 lead on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers midway through the third quarter. Yet, Bucs quarterback Tom Brady put on an incredible comeback, with his team roaring back to come within seven. Trying to run out the clock, Rams running back Cam Akers drove up the middle, but the ball came loose and Tampa recovered. Suddenly, Brady had the ball with two and a half minutes left, and only 30 yards to go. Absolutely nobody was surprised when Leonard Fournette turned a fourth-and-one into a touchdown from nine yards out, leaving the Rams only 42 seconds to go in a tie game. But Los Angeles surprised everyone. Despite not having been able to score since the start of the half, Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford hit wide receiver Cooper Kupp twice — once for 20 yards, and then for 44 yards — setting up Matt Gay’s last-second field goal. The Rams won 30-27.
The final divisional game was even better. The Buffalo Bills and Kansas City Chiefs went back and forth, and with two minutes to play, the Chiefs led 26-21, with the Bills in possession at the Chiefs’ 27. The only problem: it was fourth-and-13, an impossible conversion. No matter. Bills quarterback Josh Allen went for broke, hitting Gabriel Davis for 27 yards in the end zone, and then found Stefon Diggs for the two-point conversion. Three-point lead, Buffalo. But the Chiefs refused to take no for an answer, and starting on their own 25-yard-line with 1:54 left, they took four plays and 38 seconds to move the ball just 11 yards. And then Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City’s wunderkind quarterback, hit wide receiver Tyreek Hill over the middle, who ran to the sideline to go out-of-bounds, and then, seeing a wide-open sideline, bolted. Hill trotted into the end zone with plenty of time to spare, putting the Chiefs up 33-29, as he was mobbed by his teammates. But maybe it was too much time to spare, as Allen — starting seventy-five yards from the end zone — found Davis for 28, then Davis for 12, suddenly putting them at the Chiefs’ 35 with 32 seconds and two time outs left and giving the Bills hope again. It didn’t take long for the Bills to cash in. Veteran receiver Emmanuel Sanders took the ball to the nineteen, and then Allen found Davis again for a playoff-record fourth touchdown reception. Somehow, he’d pulled off a miracle. NBC’s announcers were beside themselves, amazed at how Allen had engineered the game-winning drive in just 49 seconds.
Yet, it was the game-winning drive that wasn’t. Mahomes passed it to Hill for 19 yards, taking the Chiefs to their own 44 and stopping the clock with eight ticks to go. The commentators, realizing the game wasn’t over yet, started arguing about how close the Chiefs had to get — the Bills’ 45? 40? — to give kicker Harrison Butker a chance at a very long game-tying field goal that would forever give him a spot in Chiefs lore. But it didn’t end up mattering. Mahomes hit Travis Kelce over the middle for 25 yards, putting the Chiefs at the Bills’ 31 and rendering the debate moot. With Arrowhead Stadium going insane, Butker put it through the uprights, and the game went to overtime at 36-36 after a final two minutes that would easily fit into the kind of kids’ sports book that had to have excitement on every play to suit a ten-year-old’s attention span. It was that great a game. Alas, overtime wasn’t as exciting. The Chiefs won the coin toss, setting Arrowhead off again, and easily dove into the end zone to make it to the AFC Championship.
After what many called the best divisional round in history, it would be reasonable to expect teams to be worn out and perform mediocrely in the Conference Championships. But that wasn’t the theme of these playoffs.
Up 24-21, the Bengals killed off five minutes and, with time winding down, found a way to make it second-and-goal from the four with a minute and a half to go. But Mahomes went down for a loss of five, and on third down, scrambled out of the pocket and took a crushing hit for a fifteen-yard-loss. But every Chiefs fan really lost their breath when the football popped out, careening to the turf in a play that would send the Bengals to the Super Bowl if they could recover it. But, alas, they couldn’t. With three seconds left, on fourth down, Harrison Butker sent the game to overtime for the second game in a row. And for the second game in a row, the Chiefs won the toss and started their march down the field. The ending was preordained. Kansas City would cap their inevitable trek down the field in the end zone and into Super Bowl LVI. Yet it wasn’t meant to be. Mahomes didn’t gain a single yard, and on third down, got picked off by Bengals safety Vonn Bell. Thanks to the NFL’s overtime rules, even a field goal at this point would win the game for the Bengals, and that’s exactly what happened, with kicker Evan McPherson slicing the game-winner through the uprights and sending the Bengals to their first Super Bowl in more than two decades, by a score of 27-24.
Over in the NFC, the 49ers took a commanding 17-7 lead, but by now, we had learned that counting a team out in these playoffs was a fool’s errand. The Rams roared back, scoring a touchdown at the end of the third, and taking their first lead since the second quarter, 20-17. Yet when the Niners got the ball back, with 1:47 left in the game and 75 yards to go, no Rams fan felt the lead was safe. But they were bailed out when linebacker Travin Howard managed to pick off quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo’s third-down pass, and Stafford kneeled it out, putting the Rams in the Super Bowl.
It’s interesting to note just how much the traditional NFL power structure has been turned on its head in just a few seasons. The Rams were chosen as the host team for the Super Bowl because, the NFL thought they had little to no chance of qualifying; the game is always played at a neutral site, so the league must have been surprised when Los Angeles acquired Matthew Stafford and suddenly made it to the Super Bowl as the fourth-seed. The Bengals, on the other hand, managed a whole four wins last year, but massively rebuilt, and took the AFC North and then the entire conference by storm.
Joe Burrow, Cincinnati’s young quarterback out of Louisiana State, will square off against the veteran Matthew Stafford, who languished for most of his career with the Detroit Lions before making it to Los Angeles. Neither of these teams has had much recent success. The last time the Rams won the Super Bowl was in 2000. The last time the Bengals won the Super Bowl? Never. 
Knowing how these playoffs have gone, this should be a fantastic power struggle. Hopefully, regardless of who comes out on top, we’ll be treated to a championship game befitting of the insane playoffs that the teams have given us so far.

Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard
On Jan. 18, Microsoft announced its intentions to acquire Activision Blizzard for an astounding $68.7 billion. This purchase will make Microsoft the third largest revenue-earner among gaming companies behind Sony and Tencent, respectively. After the acquisition has been completed, Microsoft will have a total of 30 internal game development studios in addition to publishing and esports production capabilities. 
With this acquisition, Microsoft’s Game Pass portfolio will be expanding with the plans to include Activision Blizzard games. Game Pass recently reached 25 million subscribers, which could surge following this acquisition given Activision Blizzard’s large monthly player base of nearly 400 million players.
However, before this deal is complete, the deal will be reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission due to the size of the acquisition. The goal of the investigation is to determine if the deal will harm consumers, rivals, and partners. The FTC has recently sued to block Nvidia’s acquisition of Arm and Lockheed Martin’s acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, though it is unlikely that Microsoft’s deal will be blocked.
Sony buying Bungie
Microsoft is not the only company buying up video game developers — Sony announced their intent to acquire video game developer Bungie for $3.6 billion. Bungie is best known for being the original creator of the “Halo” franchise and the developer of the “Destiny” series. It is worth noting that Microsoft acquired Bungie in 2000, but split from them in 2007, later signing a 10-year publishing deal with Activision in 2010. 
Though Bungie will be under new ownership, it will continue to be a multi-platform, independent studio and publishing company alongside the other PlayStation Studios developers. As of publishing, there are no plans to make any existing Bungie content exclusive to PlayStation platforms. 
Of the $3.6 billion that Sony is spending in acquiring Bungie, about a third of it will be going towards retaining talent at Bungie. It was announced in Sony’s earnings presentation on Feb. 2 that this money would go toward “deferred payments to employee shareholders, conditional upon their continued employment, and other retention incentives.”
‘Pokemon Legends: Arceus’ ships 6.5 million units in first week
Following its first week of sales, “Pokémon Legends: Arceus” has already exceeded 6.5 million units sold, as stated by Nintendo. In the same amount of time, the previous entries in the “Pokémon” franchise sold six million units. The game, developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, was released on Jan. 28 and was met with more positive reception than some of the more recent games in the franchise.
The game currently sits at a critic score of 84 on review aggregator Metacritic, beating Sword and Shield’s 80 and Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl’s 73. Reception among fans is also higher than the previous two entries, with Legends at an 8.1 user score, while Sword and Shield sits at a pitiful 4.3 and Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl’s scores average to 5.5.
The news of Legends’ success has also been followed by the Nintendo Switch system surpassing the Wii and PlayStation in number of units sold. This places the Switch as the number five best-selling console of all time, just under the PlayStation 4. While the Switch will need to sell over 50 million units more to surpass the PlayStation 2 to become the best selling console of all time, according to Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa, the Switch is still in the middle of its life cycle, so there is plenty of time for the Switch to break sales records. Looking ahead, Nintendo seems to have a good lineup of games planned, with the upcoming releases of “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” sequel and “Splatoon 3.”
Rockstar announces next entry in GTA franchise
On Feb. 4, Rockstar Games, the publisher responsible for franchises like “Red Dead Redemption” and “Grand Theft Auto,” confirmed the start of development on the next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series.
Rockstar Games is currently owned by Take-Two Interactive, which reported that over 155 million copies of “GTA V” have been sold, with the game making the company over $6 billion since its initial release in 2013.
This announcement comes following the release of “Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition” in November 2021. Launching on a variety of gaming platforms, the collection of “Grand Theft Auto III,” “Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,” and “Grand Theft Auto: Vice City” was met with much criticism upon release. Though meant to be modern remasters, the games have been found to have many bugs and the too-smooth graphics have been a turn-off for many. Here’s to hoping the next entry finds the same success as “GTA V.”
Team 17 announces, cancels Worms NFT project
Team 17, a British video game developer and publisher is known for franchises like “Worms,” “Overcooked,” and “The Escapists,” announced on Jan. 31 the advent of “MetaWorms,” a “Worms”-based non-fungible token (NFT) project. On the website for the project, MetaWorms is called “a generative NFT art project.” The company was immediately met with backlash following the announcement, including from companies who had previously worked with Team 17 like Aggro Crab and Playtonic, who both denounced Team 17’s decision to go into NFTs.
On the following day, Team 17 announced that they had “taken the decision to step back from the NFT space.” Though Team 17 quickly reversed its decision to get into NFT technologies, other major companies like Square Enix, Ubisoft, and Konami have not made any retractions regarding their plans to venture into NFTs.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have been gaining hype as of late, but if you asked any random person on the street to explain it to you, chances are few would be able to respond. Just the term itself is confusing; what is fungible and what is a token?
Essentially, NFTs were born of the cryptocurrency boom. They are built upon the blockchain technology Ethereum, which, like Bitcoin, supports cryptocurrencies that can be exchanged without going through an intermediary like a bank. NFTs are like cryptocurrencies — they are digital and can be exchanged without going through an intermediary and are implemented in similar ways. Each NFT however is a unique digital object. Every NFT that exists on the market is digitally different from each other, a different token on the blockchain, making them non-tradable, or, "non-fungible."
Since NFTs can really be anything digital, people are using NFTs to sell a lot of different things. Like the first-published tweet, which the founder of Twitter sold as an NFT for $2.9 million. Or the source code to the World Wide Web, sold by its creator Tim Berners-Lee for $5.4 million. A popular NFT project is CryptoKitties, a game in which you can buy a custom-generated NFT cat called a CryptoKitty and participate in games with your digital pet. People have also sold NFT music, art, videos, memes; the possibilities are endless. NFTs can be incredibly profitable, and since such an extensive range of digital artifacts can be sold as NFTs, they've gained a lot of traction in a short period of time. 
The thing is, a lot of these digital tokens can simply be found online for free, even if not purchased as an NFT. For example, an NFT gif of Nyan Cat, which is all over the internet, sold for $600,000. When a consumer purchases an NFT, they're not gaining copyright or sole ownership; they're really gaining bragging rights. What makes their copy of the digital file different from one you could download from the internet is simply that the blockchain allows for a secure way for them to prove that they own their copy, while someone who just right-clicked and saved the image doesn't. NFTs in that sense are like collectible cards in which the reward is less about the physical card itself and more about its rarity. NFTs are also collectible in the sense that they change hands — buyers can resell NFTs for prices much higher than the original, and the original creator of NFTs also can get a cut of profit from resells since ownership is easy to track through blockchain.
It is notable, however, that there is very little regulation over this new emerging technology. Digital content is easy to copy and pirate, and many people find NFTs overhyped when one can just simply find free versions online. Many NFTs, especially NFT artworks, are also illegally stolen and sold from their original creators.
The main concern raised over NFTs is their environmental impact. NFTs, cryptocurrencies, and blockchains in general are energy-guzzlers because they require users of the network to verify every transaction on the network. Each time a transaction is made, such as an NFT being bought or sold, "miners" authenticate the transaction by solving complex puzzles on their machines, which uses up enormous amounts of energy. This is by design, as blockchains want to make it difficult to add transactions and alter the ledger in order to make it more secure and prevent blocks incorrectly being added. As a consequence, it is estimated that a blockchain like Ethereum uses as much energy as the entire country of Libya.
The issues that come with NFTs are not completely unique to NFTs, and are to be expected when a technology gains rapid popularity while regulation is slow to follow. Their environmental issues are also a reflection of society as a whole, using more and more energy. Researchers are experimenting with other options and ways we can make NFTs and blockchain processes generally more environmentally friendly, but in the meantime, opinions on NFTs will likely continue to be polarized.

There’s always that crack in the sidewalk. No matter how you treat it, no matter what you tell it, weeds still grow through. You’d think they’d feel the cold air of their unwelcome. Hear your tireless remarks: “No. This is for walking, not the growing of unwanted plants. For moving on, not the growing of you in my thoughts.” And what recurring thoughts they are — these tiny green sprouts that smell like you, sound like you, look like you. AstroTurf. Who you used to be. 
People often mistake weeds for flowers, giving them chances to turn their faces towards the Sun. It’s usually only for a day or two, though. Not seven months. I didn’t think weeds could live in vases for that long, yet here you are on my bedside table, towering over my pillow in the freshwater pool I filled for you. Sometimes the water spills as your vase crashes to the floor — my floor — as I am reaching to turn on my lamp at night. Reaching for the light.
For once, let me turn my face towards the Sun.
Without a mess for me to clean up. No water-stained carpets or fragments of dirt in my bed sheets. Just the photosynthesis of everything that has ever composed me. Every stitch I have sewn and song I have sung. Every country I have stepped in and bouquets I have made out of the people around me. Every cell wall, chloroplast, leaf and thorn. Let me have my turn to soak in the rays without having to nurture the traits that should already be in your nature. 
It will only help you in the end, I promise, because in that light, I will manage to still swoop you out of the damp broken glass — barefoot — and find you a new vessel. My favorite coffee mug, the pages of that book I have started a hundred times. See, you’re still growing. You. Yes, you. This ink has become a letter, I guess. They always do. But I can’t help it because I look around and see your leaves, your petals, even your dandelion wisps that I wished upon myself. For you to become a marigold and not a nuisance. A florist’s favorite material. A girl’s favorite “good night.” But there are days, many of them, when I look around to see that I am sitting in the sidewalk, my life as the crack.
But today, unlike days before, when you enter my mind, I can see your true genetic fingerprint: a weed in a flower’s armor. And I can begin to fill the trench. Pave a new way so that unaltered mirages can meet my eyes once more. But, this time, I will not run toward a wet patch of pavement with a rag in hand. After all, it would only run from me; reaching this trick of nature would be, well, a trick of nature. Finally, a mess I cannot clean. A spill of you that only tricks my eyes. 
After seven months of waking to puddles on my bedroom floor, I never let the water irrigate my own spirit as I dashed for the sink and a mason jar. Barefoot. I only tended to the mess because in it I knew I would find you. But, now, here I am, walking through my life once more. On the sidewalk, not in it. In my botanical garden, not concrete jungle. Now, my heart knows a mirage when it sees one. Ah, yes, the reflective mirror of refracted light. Asphalt’s own vanity. Looking at it from a distance, of course, I see my silhouette in its smooth, unobstructed, impermeable surface. A marigold stares back at me, and I see myself in the Sun’s light. Fata morgana. I was the flower all along.

In 1939, former soldier, steelworker, and boxer Darryl F. Zanuck realized that what people really wanted to watch were children's fantasy adventure movies. This thought was based entirely on the success of "The Wizard Of Oz," which was produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) the year prior. Zanuck, who was allegedly barely literate, had ruled over studio giant 20th Century Fox for five years when he invested $2 million (about $40 million today) into adapting Maurice Maeterlinck’s 1909 play "The Blue Bird" into a musical film starring child actor Shirley Temple. The end product is one of the most utterly strange and terrifyingly existential children's films ever, and one that must be watched because it should never be forgotten.
The adaptation is quite loose, here. It adds songs, lavish new settings, and a completely new script to the brief Belgian play. The film also changes the setting of the play to Germany during the Napoleonic wars in order to draw a comparison to the then-ongoing Second World War, which America was about a year away from entering. "The Blue Bird" is very nearly in the ballpark of “rip-off” in regards to its inspiration, "The Wizard of Oz." It even opens with the use of black-and-white film for the opening scenes, which "dramatically” shifts to technicolor once the fantasy world is entered (though, for some infuriatingly unknown reason, the opening credits ARE in color). It is in these opening scenes that we are introduced to our central character, Mytyl (Mya-tel), played by Shirley Temple, who was at the height of her success and seen as one of the greatest assets of 20th Century Fox. Notable in her success was her continued portrayal of a kindhearted, joyous, and innocent little girl. However, at the start of "The Blue Bird," this previous persona is thrown out the window, as she is shown capturing a bird along with her brother Tyltyl (Teal-tel), and refusing to give it to her sick and dying friend Angela in the opening scene. When she returns home to Mummy Tyl and Daddy Tyl, who all speak with American accents, she insults her mother’s cooking and insists that her woodcutter father provides her with nothing (she clarifies that she would like it if he could afford to buy her a servant). Suddenly, a man with a big hat enters the scene and tells poor Daddy Tyl that he will be leaving for war tomorrow, where he will probably die. 
The children are woken up the next morning by Berylune, a fairy who transforms their dog and cat (of course named Tylo and Tylette) into humans. She tells the children and human-animals that they need to find the bluebird of happiness — kinda just because she said to. So, with nothing else to do, the children, the animals, and their lamp (which is also transformed into a human) set off on an adventure to find the obscure bird of happiness. The first place they look is a graveyard. 
We get our first taste of the film's existential ambiguity here. After the children stumble across their grandparents' grave, the grandparents (you can guess their names) appear. They awaken because “somebody must be thinking of them” and are immediately filled with energy and joy as they hear the children coming towards them. This scene strangely notes that the family celebrated Easter together, though these religious practices are at odds with the eternal state as beings that just exist to be thought of, only truly dying once they are forgotten. The children spend a brief bit of time with their grandparents, and just leave when they find no further help in getting the blue bird. Everything about this scene makes me extremely uncomfortable and puts me in a state of mild depression. The first time I saw the grandparents fade back into nothingness, I started weeping. I used to wonder why the hell this scene is in a movie that is supposed to be a competitor of one of the most renowned light-hearted family movies of its time. And while no one will ever be able to answer that, I have come to accept that out of that context, part of me is glad that this was made. If not just because of how impactful parts of it can be on me, and maybe others. I guess that's why I am hoping you will watch this movie, and believe me, there is so much I didn’t mention here that is absolutely insane and worth watching. It is free, probably illegally, on YouTube, and even if you find the story and characters to be utter nonsense, you will be wowed by the massive, visually stunning sets. This is clearly where most of the budget went, and they make sure to capitalize on each moment. 
The kids don’t even find the blue bird in the end. After venturing to the kingdom of unborn children, where they meet a girl who says she will one day be their little sister, and a boy who will be born as Abraham Lincoln (yes, this really happens), the children return home empty-handed, only to realize that the bird that they had caught at the beginning of the movie was blue, and they had just not realized this. I think the audiences that panned this movie at the time of its release probably could have learned something from this ending. 
To promote the movie, a half-hour radio play was produced live for a studio audience a month prior to its release. During this performance, a woman rose from the audience with a gun and tried to shoot Shirley Temple in the face, because she thought that she had stolen the soul of her dead daughter. This, the failure of the movie (which did not return its mighty investment at the box office), and Temple’s following film with 20th Century Fox, pushed her childhood career into nothing, with continued unsuccessful roles. Apparently, “miserable little shit” was not a side of Shirley that the public wanted to see, and so she was forgotten. She did little acting once she stopped making films at the age of 26, and turned to politics in the '80s. After successful work with Richard Nixon in the United Nations General Assembly, she was appointed by George H. W. Bush to be the U.S. ambassador to Czechoslovakia.

Hotblockchain, also known as nothotblockchain, hotblockchainissad, and cryptobaddie1, is a niche internet microcelebrity, with almost 650,000 current TikTok followers, as well as 11,700 Twitch followers. She also goes to Carnegie Mellon! Recently she took time out of her schedule for an interview with us. Here it is, abridged and slightly edited for clarity.
Pillbox: Thanks for doing this interview.
HBC: My pleasure.
Pillbox: I’d like to ask you some questions. So how many TikTok accounts have you had?
HBC: I've had quite a few. Throughout high school, my family was middle class and once my dad passed halfway through my sophomore year, it was made very clear to me that college was not something I could afford unless I was involved in that. Throughout high school, I created three different accounts on Tik Tok to test the algorithm out. And then when I got accepted to Carnegie, I created my first account that was designed for the algorithm, but that got banned. Right now, I have four accounts, and they're all kind of backups at this point.
Pillbox: So how did you go about designing them for the algorithm?
HBC: My first account was just for messing around, and then one of my videos got a million views. I wasn't in it because I was curious to see what it took. It was just a little funny thing, but I promptly deleted that account. My second account was kinda overtly sexual, and I was 16 at the time, so I was curious to see how that would work. Obviously I wasn’t doing anything sexual. And then my third account was a political account, and that was to see how my ideas would be received. That one I really liked, but I deleted it because it was becoming more about my own opinion than about information. But I noticed that even when the content was purely political, there was a lot of sexualizing of me in the comments. And so when I created my account the day I got into CMU, I figured out the image to cultivate. A third of it is your personality, and in that personality, it's like: I'm not stupid and I'm not looking to grab your money. It's like, I'm innocent and these are my outfits and I have fun. So that's kind of the image that I cultivate. Additionally I added in aspects of being nerdy to some accounts, but not to others just to see how that played out.
Pillbox: So why do you think you keep getting banned?
HBC: That one's easy. I have big boobs and so that's half of it. The other half of it is that I have an ex-boyfriend whose new girlfriend hates my guts and reports every single one of my videos. And on TikTok, it takes like one report, if it's substantiated, to get it under review. And the more videos you have under review, the more likely you are to get banned. So she's really, you know, the bane of my existence at the moment.
Pillbox: That's rough. As a public figure, you're open-facing. Does that lead to harassment? 
HBC: Yeah. So actually, it's a weird kind of harassment because for one I get recognized by CMU students and other people at every bar and party I go to, which is kind of weird. But it's also the little things, right? There was a time that I was just in my dorm and this kid came and knocked on the dorm. I was streaming on Twitch and he was like, “Oh I'm going to shout out my friends.” To the students here, it's funny, it's in good fun, but it shows people online — who I do get a lot of death threats from — that it's incredibly easy to find me. So the harassment in person is not what I would call real harassment so much as it gives inertia to the idea that those death threats could have weight.
Pillbox: Is that why you changed your Instagram name? 
HBC: Yeah. All of my accounts. You can't find my last name anywhere now, thank God, because I also am the only person ever to have my name, because my last name is traditionally Macedonian, and Emily does not go with that. So if you have my last name, you can find my address, and that's really scary.
Pillbox: Do you think you're going to continue doing TikTok and Twitch as a career path?
HBC: Well, I think it would be a naïve assumption to assume. Obviously, when I'm 23, there will be a bouncier, bubblier 18 year old who's more enticing. I really like Twitch, I want to keep doing that as long as I can, because on Twitch, I've made genuine connections. TikTok is an avenue to send people to my Twitch account.
Pillbox: So do you have future plans for your Twitch account? 
HBC: I do. A lot of people assume that my Twitch account is similar to the kind of content I do on TikTok when in reality, it's mostly study hours and homework and just talking and stuff. And that's something that I can see myself doing for a long time, as long as people want me to keep doing it. So the plan there is to just continuously provide the experience that is college, the college dorm, because I think that's one of the enticing things about it. And then whatever my career is at that point, hopefully I will have people who are interested primarily in me and my life, and that would just be the same way that YouTubers vlog updates with me. 
Pillbox: You see yourself cultivating a different fan base on Twitch.
HBC: I think I am, just because the way that people interact with me on Twitch is insanely different from the way they do on TikTok or Clover or any of the other apps I'm on.
Pillbox: I was looking through some of the TikToks and all the comments were people writing very sexualizing comments, which sounds like it would get on your nerves. 
HBC: I mean, it's the function of how I afford this school, right? Like it’d be silly of me to pretend I could get on the internet, post what I post or even just stand there, and not be sexualized. And to be fair, I do profit off that sexualization and that misogyny. I think it would be naïve and ignorant to presume that that wouldn't happen. So it's not that it necessarily gets on my nerves just so much as it's expected.
Pillbox: With school work and social life and four TikToks and Twitch and all these other accounts, how do you balance it all? 
HBC: Well, it's my job, right. I really wanted to go to school here, and I realized that the tradeoff there was that sometimes I don't always get to do fun things. Sometimes I have to stay in and work. And like, I understand that it doesn't really seem like work, but you know, it is a lot. I'm my own manager, I have to consult with brands by myself, and I do my taxes by myself. It's scary, but this was the deal that I made with myself so I could attend. And it helps that my community is supportive of me, sometimes just sitting silently and doing my homework. I really appreciate that about them because it allows me to keep this up.

30 
Adele 
This shit was no doubt one of my favorite projects of the year. Adele ain’t ever disappointed us and she conTINues to sound even more incredible every year. With a six-year hiatus following "25" the anticipation for "30" was hotttttt. What has set this album apart from the rest for me, is how many different sounds Adele cultivates. From "Cry Your Heart Out," to "All Night Parking," she continues to provide something new on every piece. Now, what was crazy was her making this mainly about her divorce, a part of her life we have only been able to see through the media. Not only does she let us in on this experience, but she holds a magnifying glass to every detail of her life that this experience has affected. "My Little Love," one of the most vulnerable tracks on this record, comes to mind in this instance as we hear the conversations she has with her child about her feelings, something I believe that should be a more common occurrence among parents and their children. She reminds us that there is no perfect way to do anything in this life, how important it is to live presently, and that we are enough exactly as we are. Be patient with yourself. Forgive yourself. Healing is not linear. 
Favorite lyric: "When you’re in doubt go at your own pace" 
Favorite tracks: "All Night Parking," "To Be Loved," "My Little Love" 
CAPRISONGS 
FKA twigs 
I fucking love this mixtape. It gets better after every listen. In the amount of detail and nuance with melodies, countermelodies, and spoken word passages, FKA delivers an ethereal record with an incredible catalog of sounds. I feel like I’m listening to a fairy in a forest. She sounds like candy, fr y’all. The inventiveness of this project is apparent from start to finish. She somehow manages to add something unexpected on every track. From tracks like "ride the dragon" to "meta angel" to "minds of men," the production sits in a world between hyperpop, r&b, and hip hop and fuses them seamlessly. And to close out the whole thing (ugh y’all this shit really had me in my feels fr) the final track "thank you song" hitssssss. Like even if you don’t got nobody that makes you feel like that right now, you still gon feel everything she’s saying and that is the mark of good writing. It’ll make you wish you had someone to be sad about. What sticks out for me though is the inclusion of spoken word passages, which mostly are just voice memos of conversations between FKA and people who I’m assuming are her friends. It somehow made me feel even closer to her and reminded me of conversations I have with my own friends. There’s a layer of youthfulness, yet we can sense that this is still a period of growth and change for her, as it is for all of us.
Favorite lyric: "Lay down your fears, baby, ain’t nobody die from it, no" 
Favorite tracks: "ride the dragon," "meta angel," "lightbeamers," "pamplemousse," "careless," "darjeeling," "thank you song" 
DS4EVER 
Gunna
This album ain’t really pushin P if I’m being totally honest. It’s pretty listenable, and if you pay attention, there are some pretty hilarious lines. Overall though, it's fine. While there are a few tracks that offer a bit more substance than the rest, I kinda expected more from a 20 track album. I think Gunna’s strength lies in his more collaborative projects. Coming off more recent projects like "Drip Harder" and "Slime Language 2" as well as his "Lemonade" feature, I was interested to see what he has to offer at this point in his career on an album with limited features. I think most of the production leaves a lot to be desired. That being said, I do appreciate the more vulnerable moments on the album, specifically on "livin wild" and "you & me" both of which include some pretty great samples that serve the story telling very well. And not to mention that Chlöe’s feature on "you & me" was exactly what the song needed. This one wasn’t that memorable for me. But keep pushin P y’all. 
Favorite lyrics: "She not a lesbian, for P, she turn Pesbian" 
Favorite tracks: "how you did that," "you & me," "livin wild," "thought i was playin" 
Signal 
Sunday Saari
With her very first EP, Carnegie Mellon’s very own Sunday Saari is one to be on the lookout for. While that has always been the case from her first single, "August," to her first collaborative work, "Things Change" with Laughton Royce, another rising artist with an album on the way, to her final single before this EP, "Waves," lemme just tell y’all we were readyyyyyyyy. And lemme tell you something else … she ate. Opening with "Jaded" was just such a smart choice. It’s like I’m being swaddled in a blanket and carried to a pool where you can only hear the rest of the songs when you’re in the water. Such a wonderful ease and care to bring the audience in and prepare us for what’s to come. The opening guitar is so gentle and honest and simple anyone can listen to this. I personally feel like this track would also be just as effective as an album closer. There’s something so complete about it yet it leaves me with a sense of longing. Then we move on to "August" which lemme tell y’all right this instant, is one hell of a first single. The vocals themselves let you know exactly who you’re dealing with. Overall, writing and vocals are on point. Keep up with Sunday Saari! 
Favorite lyric: "Rise and fall, rebuilding a soul, after liars and thieves, use and leave"
Favorite track: "Jaded"

When Carnegie Mellon Housing & Residential Education Services sent a survey to its students in 2018, there was a lot to cover. Bob Reppe, the Senior Director of Planning & Design, walked through the survey — and what came of it — in an interview with The Tartan. Essentially, Housing wanted to know: “If you’re not living on campus, why?”
Housing suspected that, if feedback was appropriately internalized, 600-800 more students might live on campus. One of the biggest detractors, Reppe noted, was unit type. Upperclassmen were uninterested in sharing a bathroom with 29 other students. Instead, they preferred semi- and regular suite layouts that offered greater privacy, with a common room, individual bathrooms, and (in the case of regular suites) kitchens. On this front, Housing delivered. 
Fifth and Clyde debuted this fall, welcoming 264 students to luxurious apartment-style housing. Gone was the traditional dorm setup. The shared floor bathroom — which Reppe attributed to successful first-year bonding — was borne from the building’s design. Forbes and Beeler Apartments, which is set to open in Fall 2023, will follow a similar plan.
According to a Community Advisor (CA) employed by Residential Education (ResEd) who asked to remain anonymous, Fifth and Clyde was designed to have alternating blue and green carpeting on each floor. When all floors were covered in blue, the dorm’s opening was delayed to replace half of the blue carpeting with green. Some students are frustrated by superficial expenses like these. “No student would have given a shit," said the CA. "It was a waste of carpet.”
Tom Cooley, the Executive Director of Housing Services & Space Planning, would disagree. “There is a lot more carpeting on campus than Housing might want,” he said in an interview with The Tartan. But, he continued, “Students want … to walk in their bare feet. Generally, student feedback was: we want carpeting everywhere.” 
Fifth and Clyde and Forbes and Beeler are ushering in a new era of Carnegie Mellon Housing. Robin Kuo, the CA of Fifth and Clyde’s inaugural ResEd staff, described the marketing surrounding the buildings: huge, shiny, and “quite frankly a little bit extra.” 
Kuo acknowledged that new dorms are necessary to solve capacity problems amidst growing enrollment. “But at the same time,” she said, “what good is it to up your numbers when nobody wants to live in all your other spaces?”
These “other spaces” include Donner and Mudge Houses, which have seen bouts of flooding, and Margaret Morrison Apartments' unwarranted fire alarm triggers. Donner struggles to consistently supply sufficient hot water in the building. Housing conducted a physical assessment on its residence buildings, color-coding dorm spaces based on their conditions. The aforementioned examples likely characterize red spaces. Stever House, Reppe offered, is green. 
When asked why Housing is investing in new buildings rather than enhancing old ones, Cooley explained that it was not an “or” situation; it was an “and” situation. They are meeting increasing capacity needs while simultaneously making changes to older dorms, according to Cooley. 
When asked about plans for refurbishments in Donner, a dorm known for less-than-ideal facilities, Cooley said it “is in the master plan with no date. Donner is still being evaluated,” and Housing has yet to decide “what the next steps are.” 
During training, ResEd staff is introduced not just to amenities but the structural issues that come with them, according to Kuo. “It feels a little bit strange that [Housing is] saying: ‘These are the kinks of these buildings and you are going to have to work around them.’” 
The discrepancy between new buildings and their aging counterparts is not lost on the anonymous CA interviewed for the article. “Everyone stuck in the old dorms is like: ‘Well what the fuck? We just want air conditioning and garbage disposals in the sinks.’”
Cooley noted that Housing recently received similar feedback when discussing plans for Fifth and Clyde. “Students said they didn’t care about amenities,” he said. Instead, they wanted natural light, which boosts serotonin levels and helps prevent seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Now, students walk into Fifth and Clyde enshrouded by sunlight, with direct access everywhere on the first floor.
Overall, Housing is working on a wide range of projects. Henderson House and Residence on Fifth will be re-carpeted, Clyde House repainted. Fairfax Apartments will be offline for the 2022-2023 academic year to accommodate facilities updates and new amenities. Housing is planning to include a grocery store on the first floor of Forbes and Beeler, similar to Forbes Street Market on the University of Pittsburgh’s campus.
“We’re doing a complete gut of Scobell House,” Reppe stated. Cooley enumerated the changes: complete renovation of bathrooms (which will now be all-gender, following the Stever 5th floor precedent), implementation of air conditioning, and remodeling of the kitchen space.
Student feedback has also called for water fountains on each dorm floor, more water bottle fill stations, and ample carpeting. These examples, according to Cooley, highlight the important relationship between Housing and students. He pointed to the Student Dormitory Council (SDC) as the main source of dialogue. “SDC, the voice of our students, is important to us.”

Pittsburgh has been no stranger to infrastructure failures. Between regular flooding on Route 51, the collapse of Route 30 in East Pittsburgh in 2018, the Birmingham Bridge deck dropping 8 inches in 2008, the infamous sinkhole that swallowed a Pittsburgh bus in 2019 and many other similar events, the Fern Hollow Bridge collapse looks like another in a series of infrastructure failures in Pittsburgh’s modern history. 
But on the day of the collapse, President Biden visited the site. In his remarks to law enforcement officials, he acknowledged the scope of the damage and pledged money to fix the bridges in Pittsburgh and 43,000 other bridges across the country. This was just before he visited Carnegie Mellon’s Mill 19 research facility, where he highlighted the importance of infrastructure investment and development. Pittsburgh mayor Ed Gainey, who attended Biden’s speech, emphasized the damage caused by the collapse, stating that “we were fortunate” that no one was killed. The collapse resulted in 10 injuries, but none that were life-threatening. 
An investigation has been launched to determine what factors contributed to the collapse, but first responders echoed Mayor Gainey’s sentiments. In comments to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Officer Jeff LaBella said, “I thought there were going to be casualties for sure. I could not believe there weren’t any casualties when we got down there. I was expecting the absolute worst.” 
Both Mayor Gainey and Governor Tom Wolf signed a proclamation of disaster emergency and within the week, the Biden administration approved $25 million from the recent infrastructure package to rebuild the collapsed bridge. But questions remain on the future of the bridge and its reconstruction as well as the future of infrastructure in Allegheny County. 
Nearly 20% of Pennsylvania’s bridges are in poor condition, according to a review from the American Society of Civil Engineers (ACSE). Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) records show that in Allegheny County, there are 175 bridges that are in poor condition out of 1,582 bridges total (approximately 11%). 
The Fern Hollow Bridge had a poor rating based on inspections from the Department of Transportation’s InfoBridge page, which contains records of bridge inspections and conditions. The substructure had a “satisfactory” rating while the deck and superstructure had a “poor” rating. Elements like the bridge’s railings and guardrail ends also didn’t meet the criteria, and the structural evaluation and deck geometry appraisals had “minimum tolerable” and “intolerable; high priority corrective action” ratings, respectively. City Councilor Corey O’Connor, who represents the district in which the bridge was located, told WESA that the inspection for the bridge in 2021 was conducted by a third-party contractor, but he could not remember who. Additionally, the bridge had been known to be in poor condition, but there was no indication of whether it needed to be shut down. 
Jonathan Shimko, a previous ACSE president, clarified the purpose of the bridge ratings, saying that “engineers are risk-averse by nature” and that one poor element in a bridge can drive the bridge’s overall score. However, without commenting on what specifically led to the bridge’s deterioration, he pointed out that infrastructure failures are the culmination of a series of events rather than single actors or instances. He also made clear that it would be difficult to know the state of infrastructure without “money and investment to make sure we can maintain what we have built.”
In a news briefing, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chair Jennifer Homendy stated “certainly we do have a crisis for our aging infrastructure,” adding that this crisis is “something that our states and the entire U.S. government has to deal with.” NTSB is conducting the investigation into the bridge collapse, which could take 12-18 months. 
Councilor O’Connor, in partnership with Mayor Gainey’s office, proposed the creation of an infrastructure commission to prevent future collapses like the Fern Hollow Bridge. O’Connor’s goal with the commission is to ensure “Pittsburghers get to where they need to go safely and securely” and to bring experts who can “provide guidance on our immediate infrastructure needs and prioritizing long-term strategic investment.” The commission is to be composed of 15 members, including city officials, labor organizers, residents with applicable experience, and construction industry professionals. In addition to the commission, O’Connor proposed legislation that would require regular reports for the city’s infrastructure. A vote is expected on these pieces of legislation in the coming week. 
Initial steps for the bridge’s reconstruction are underway as construction crews and contractors assist the NTSB with its investigation while preparing for demolishing the bridge and clearing the area. Frick Park partially reopened on Jan. 31. Local officials have stated it will take at least a year to replace the collapsed bridge.

In recent years, the region of Pittsburgh that encapsulates much of Regent Square, Braddock, and Wilkinsburg has been renamed “the East End.” To me, it’s a euphemism: a way to compartmentalize an area of the city that people don’t want to have to think about. People in Pittsburgh love to do that — we come up with lots of names and nicknames and talk about how unique our various neighborhoods are. But in reality, it's all just a big game to put people where we believe they belong — and keep them there. Black people belonged in East Liberty until they didn’t anymore, and then it became that place where the Target is. Pittsburgh is a little bit like Swiss cheese: riddled with gaps in care, food, and money for the people who need it most. 
The East End in particular is important to me because that’s where I grew up, though I went to school on the other side of the divide for the entirety of my life (including now), in Squirrel Hill/Oakland. If there’s anything I understand, it's how the infrastructure that connects the East End to this region purposely fails to account for the needs of the people that the city deems invaluable. Being able to get to and from school and my friends’ houses was the most important part of my life for a long time, yet I never figured out how to do it effectively, getting hurt quite a few times walking through the woods or biking where I shouldn’t have been. What I did learn was that the transportation issues that impacted me did not impact people that lived not so far away from me, albeit in much more expensive houses. 
I also learned that there are three main ways to get out of the East End, not including the very out-of-the-way commute-time-doubling ways that some people try to bring up. The first of these is the Squirrel Hill tunnel, part of the parkway that is notorious for high traffic during commute hours. The tunnel is at the end of a bridge that spans a ravine near a set of slag dumps. Interestingly, this bridge is scheduled to be replaced within the next few years, pending a decision about how exactly to do so with as little disruption as possible.
The reason disruption is a concern is because of the next “way,” my personal favorite. Running under the aforementioned bridge is Commercial Road, which is magically renamed Forward Avenue right in the spot where it intersects with Summerset, one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in urban Pittsburgh (let the wheels start turning here). While the bridge is replaced, Commercial must close, which is nothing new. I could write another novel entirely regarding Commercial, but I’ll leave it to this brief description: Commercial is entirely unwalkable. It is a lengthy, windy, and extremely steep road that rests on the side of a hill such that if you made a wrong move while driving down, you would likely not live to tell the story. It is highly prone to traffic-stopping mud and rock slides. It has been closed many times in my life, often for extended periods of time, as crews attempt to stop it from quite literally sliding off the face of the hill on which it rests. Driving up that street might literally be the most dangerous thing I do regularly.
Now, this whole closure of Commercial and the Parkway bridge was set to bring a decent amount of turmoil to the traffic patterns between the East and the city, but the situation just got a lot worse — this is where we arrive at the third “way.”
On Friday, Jan. 28, the Forbes Avenue bridge spanning Fern Hollow decided its life had come to an end. In what, from some reports, was a rather anticlimactic descent, it simply slid out of existence into the ravine below. Ironically, it brought down with it a 61B Port Authority Bus, one of the only ones that run on that side of the city. The image of that bus, so close to getting off the other side of the bridge before the collapse, literally brought tears to my eyes. For so long, all I wanted was to get out of the East End. Sometimes it felt like I never would, like I would be taking 61Bs out — so many 61Bs — and I would be driving over the incredibly shaky Forbes bridge and praying for Commercial to hang onto its hill for the rest of my life in an endless cycle driven by taxes and redlining and gun violence. 
The poetic irony of that bridge’s collapse on the morning of President Biden’s arrival in Pittsburgh to speak on infrastructure was not missed, especially by the CMU community, who hosted the president at our Mill 19 property. What was missed by many was the fact that that irony was no act of God, or of fate, or anything else. The truth is that the city of Pittsburgh only cares about the quality of life of its residents when improving that quality benefits the city. Nobody seemed to care about that bridge, and, mark my words, it will not be repaired for a long, long time. It was bound to fall one day or another, regardless of whether or not Air Force One was flying over it, just like Commercial will inevitably slide off that hill one day. Once again, no one will care. The people at the metaphorical and literal bottom will keep adjusting their commutes again and again as they have always done when things like this happen, and life will go on just as it always has.

In 1968, the historic court case “Tinker v. Des Moines” laid the foundations for freedom of speech for public school students across the United States. Under this ruling, it became the standard that students “did not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.” Essentially, this means that students who are on public school property still hold their first amendment rights.
However, the right to freedom of the press for public school students was challenged in 1988 by the “Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier” ruling. Before the publication of the Hazelwood East High School’s student newspaper, an article recounting students’ experiences with teen pregnancy and divorce was removed due to administrative oversight. In a 5-3 ruling, it was decided that the administration’s move was not in violation of students’ rights. As such, it is now the standard that administrators can censor students for “any reasonable pedagogical purpose.”
This ruling affects the rights of student journalists across the country. The Hazelwood ruling has become the new standard, and as such, the content that is distributed on public school grounds can be reviewed and blocked by the administration before publication.
In an effort to return to the standard established by “Tinker v. Des Moines,” many states have independently passed what is “New Voices” laws. These laws remove the option for administrators to review student material before publication in states where they are enacted. It is important to note that New Voices laws still allow for censorship, but only if it is libelous or slanderous (and therefore not covered by The First Amendment). There are currently 15 states who have passed New Voices legislation, with New Jersey being the most recent in 2021. Legislation is currently underway in eight states, including Pennsylvania.
HB 2102 has been introduced to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and is currently in the House Education Committee. Currently titled the “Free School Media Act,” Rep. Melissa Shusterman (D-157) serves as the primary sponsor of the bill, along with four other (Democrat) cosponsors. Some main features of the bill include the removal of prior review in school entities (including charter and private schools), training for student journalists so they can become aware of their rights, and protections for publication advisors.
The purpose of HB 2102 is to put processes back in the hands of student editors, which the staff of The Tartan fully backs. As student journalists ourselves, we see how important it is to curate what content we publish without having to fear the powers that be. Powerful journalism begins at the local level; organizations at every step of the way should be able to publish the content they want.
This is not the first time New Voices legislation has been introduced within the Pennsylvania legislature. In the 2019 session, SB 806 was introduced to the Pennsylvania Senate by primary sponsor former Rep. Andrew Dinniman. It was cosponsored by four other senators (three Democrat and one Republican) and was referred to the Senate Education Committee, but unfortunately never left.
It’s important to note that the New Voices movement is nonpartisan — making sure student journalists have the ability to report without censorship. Empowering student perspectives, content, and initiative is a goal that does not belong as a tool of political division as journalism is intended to explore every voice.
Though The Tartan doesn’t face any prior review, for many of us, our journey into journalism began at the high school level, where prior review is a common practice. While prior review may not exactly be an obstacle for publication, it can lead to a barrier for idea generation: self-censorship. When student journalists approach topics they may deem controversial, they will tend to soften or remove topics so that they are not flagged by prior review. Students shouldn’t be afraid to publish topics due to administrative overreach, either directly or indirectly. Prior review puts restraints on student speech.
As the New Voices movement and  efforts to remove censorship from student journalism is completely a grassroots effort, we applaud all those who are working to strengthen the rights of student journalists not just in Pennsylvania, but across the country. We recognize that it may be an uphill battle given society’s perception of media and misinformation today, but it is certainly a battle worth fighting for.

It is surreal that in 2022, the United States is closer than ever to the brink of war with Russia, but here we are. There’s not much to really think about at this point. Russia has placed thousands of soldiers at the Ukrainian border, intelligence reports are warning of an imminent invasion, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is building up deterrence and defense capabilities in Eastern Europe, and potential NATO expansion is now the big flashpoint that could very well lead us into war. Putin has the support of Xi Jinping on the matter, with Xi publicly opposing NATO expansion in solidarity with Putin. Deep down, every war hawk in the United States is cheering internally while panicking externally, likely feeling vindicated for sticking with their harsh, incessant rhetoric for years. 
Great power competition has made its return, a relic of an era that many don’t truly know because they weren’t born yet or they’ve just forgotten about it by now. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the United States didn’t exactly know what to do with its place in the world as the only major power left. Foreign policy and war doctrines evolved over the next decade until the next major shock: 9/11. From there, the U.S. cultivated troops into a counterinsurgency force and explored other forms of warfare that were more suited for conflicts with non-state actors. This allowed the U.S. to intervene in other countries’ affairs with a greater degree of efficiency that didn’t require total occupation (but opted for total occupation twice anyway). Of course, counterinsurgency was a mixed bag with many more negatives than positives, but before Americans had time to really reckon with the consequences of that era, interstate power competition has begun to rear its head once again. 
With this, Americans really have to grapple with how interconnected everything is. The United States is in an awful spot domestically. Between book burnings in Tennessee, rising rates of crime and costs of living, homelessness, debt, and callous politicians more interested in their paycheck and power than fixing issues impacting millions of Americans, fighting a war may look like it doesn’t alleviate those issues. That’s because it doesn’t. War is a form of foreign policy, albeit the most destructive option. If Americans are choosing to fight a war, it isn’t just for power. It’s for survival, too. But the motives for survival are hard to discern when Americans have been watching their government fight so many pointless wars and intervene in so many conflicts to seemingly no avail for decades. 
There are two ideas fundamentally at conflict with each other in U.S. foreign policy. On one hand, Americans want strong relationships and commitments with their allies, an idyllic international system that is beneficial for all who take part in it. On the other hand, Americans want to be the leader of that international system because then they get to shape how people take part in it and put down all those who oppose that system or don't implement the values of the international system the way that the U.S. sees fit. During the Cold War, the U.S. committed atrocities and undermined sovereignties constantly while preaching about how atrocities are bad and sovereignty is good. But ultimately, the collapse of the Soviet Union was vindication for everything the U.S. had done, even if the collapse of the Soviet Union had less to do with U.S. foreign policy and more to do with the Soviet Union’s decaying social and economic conditions through the 1970s and 1980s.
Through the 1990s and the U.S. counterinsurgency era, the American government refined its Cold War-era strategies. Since the Soviet Union, the main power threatening American hegemony, was gone, new opportunities emerged for the U.S. to push even further in its goal to become the ambitious leader of the world. Technological breakthroughs and economic imperialism accelerated this process, and 9/11 sealed the deal by adding even more heavy-handed nationalistic sentiments and reactionary political ideals into the mix. 
Now, in 2022, this ambition is being tested in a way that the U.S. has never quite experienced before. The U.S. is no longer the only major economic, technological, or military power. Both the U.S. and its allies have key economic and military partnerships with those rival powers like China and Russia. The U.S. government has willingly shown that it will fight conflicts that don’t need to be fought and engage in nation-building efforts to keep the United States' strategic positioning, continuing to posture themselves as world leaders. Failure to act on this new flashpoint with Ukraine wouldn’t just be a blow to whatever little bit of credibility we have left after our disastrous counterinsurgency era. It would be the final straw to break the hypocritical camel’s back, fully exposing the U.S. as the selfish, egotistical, short-sighted, and reactionary empire that it is.
To be quite honest, I don’t think a lot of Americans will know or understand what to do. Even world leaders don’t know what the best strategy is. The U.S. is truly in dark, murky waters right now, and another war is the last thing people (or at least a good number of people) want. I certainly am one of them. None of us know how this is going to play out, but we have to be ready. Looking at the course of history, war has always been a part of its development. Most of history has been shaped by wars. The U.S. was created by wars, too, whether it was for expansion or survival. Americans can try all they want to move past it with modern sensibilities on peace, conflict, violence, and human rights, but this sensibility is coming too little too late. 
Situations like the current predicament with Russia and Ukraine were what America’s alliances, international structures, and foreign policy apparatus were meant to avoid, and whatever Americans do here is going to define the future. The ideal situation is that Russia doesn’t invade Ukraine and the U.S. is able to negotiate another deal with them that would respect Ukrainian sovereignty while acknowledging and addressing both Russia’s and Ukraine’s security concerns, as well as ours. The world rarely works in the ideal way. If Russia does invade and the U.S.-led NATO acts, there will be a war which is deadly, costly, and awful for everyone involved. But if there is no action, then the modern  values that have defined international affairs since World War II will truly mean nothing, and it will make the imperialist strategies and visions of U.S. rivals bolder. No matter what your opinion is on the role of the U.S. in the world, I don’t think any American reading this is going to be ready to live in a world where the U.S. isn’t the dominant power, even its most vocal critics. It’s something that is taken for granted, and Americans are now in a lose-lose situation where every option leads to some undesirable outcome. The U.S. is officially at Russia’s mercy, and all Americans can do is hope their government doesn’t mess the situation up further.

Gone is the Resnik Café, home of the burger and milkshake. We have now entered the hopefully long reign of the Egg Shoppe. According to the wonderful blurb writers over at Carnegie Mellon Dining, you may:
“Start — or end — your day right at the NEW Egg Shoppe! Keep it simple with a la carte breakfast items or level up with our chef’s mouth-watering sandwich and breakfast burrito creations. Also offering seasonally-flavored dishes, coffee and shakes. Breakfast — or dessert — can be yours nearly any time with our extended hours.”
Their hours may be extended and their breakfast may be a la carte, but it sure ain’t simple, and the new addition to our flavorful food family has left some scratching their heads. When you first enter the Egg Shoppe, your eyes will be drawn to the large menu boasting various foodstuffs attached to prices that precious few will ever use, us normies content with  using blocks and Dinex. Your first thought will probably be “where burger?”, but do not fear! Remember the simple acronym EPWFM to know all you need.
E-Eggs
P-Pancakes
W-Waffles
F-French toast
M-Milkshake
Then your eyes will stumble upon the demonic chart describing hot sides, cold sides, and fruits. To be honest, I can’t help you there. I don’t know why they put 2x bonus multipliers on it, what the colors mean, why they made the menu so big but this so small.
In order to update my knowledge of the best grub on campus, I had an Egg Shoppe day. I had eaten there prior, but I decided I needed a deeper dive. Thus: one day, one dining place, four meals. This is the Egg Shoppe Challenge. I started my day with an egg sandwich built of my own design: fried egg on a croissant with Pepper Jack cheese. It was well made and did not take too long to order. However, the only cheeses they offer are Pepper Jack and American, and I will not eat American cheese due to personal reasons we don’t need to elaborate here. The sandwich was not very filling, but I would willingly have eaten another one, and most likely would have had I not had a personal engagement that needed urgent attention (remember: I am very busy and important).
For lunch, I got myself a three-egg omelet with bacon and Pepper Jack cheese, as well as a hot chocolate, because coffee tastes bad and hurts my tummy. The omelet came with a slice of bread that was very tasty. The omelet was massive but passable, a lot of egg but not much flavor. The bacon inside did not have an even distribution and the cheese was rather stretchy, but food is food. I can say that if you live nearby, the egg omelet would function well as a late-night-energy booster, especially since the Egg Shoppe is the only late-night Resnik location. The hot chocolate was actually disgusting though. The plastic cup it was put in immediately started warping and I was not able to set it down as the bottom had started looking like one of those Viking drinks that were made out of horns. The smell of the chocolate was disconcerting, and the color could only be described as drops of food coloring into unclear water. The taste was rather foul too. If you want hot chocolate, please just go to La Prima.
For dinner, I purchased the Breakfast Bomber with a fried egg, bacon, sausage, a hash brown patty, and American cheese, all in between two slices of French toast, like some sort of Epic Meal Time monstrosity, and a strawberry milkshake. In comparison to the days of yesteryear, milkshake production is much faster, and the quantity of potential milkshakes seems to be much larger. Students will remember the notorious lack of shakes at the Carnegie Mellon Café and making the journey over just to be told, “Sorry, we don’t have any.” Of course, they still seem to be lacking their semi-mythical Oreo shake of which I have heard rumors, and it seems to appear on the menu as a feature milkshake, yet I have still not met a single soul who has had it. The strawberry shake is great, and I’ve heard some have had positive experiences with the vanilla. The Breakfast Bomber is very, very filling, especially for such a small package. The hash browns give a good meat base, and I can forgive the American cheese as a necessity for a burger or burrito base. French toast as the bread feels a bit “epic bacon,” but when your entire existence as a dining location is based on breakfast, you can forgive some breakfast propaganda coming through.
Finally, at around 10:30 p.m., I traipsed back down to get myself some pancakes as a final hurrah to my Mr. Beast challenge. Three pancakes with the strawberry-like thing, whipped cream, and maple syrup. This is the best dessert on campus. I give it a full-throated recommendation.
All in all, you should not judge a restaurant by its name. The Egg Shoppe is a satisfactory addition to the Carnegie Mellon dining stable, and its late hours are a serious perk. The staff is friendly, and although the time to make the food provided can be somewhat long, if you pick the right item, your wait can be worthwhile.
