Last Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon University track team traveled to Roanoke, VA to compete in the Noke Elite Meet hosted by Roanoke College, facing off against seven other schools in the region, including the hosts Washington and Lee University and Piedmont College, among others.
The Carnegie Mellon University women did well in the field events. In the high jump, first-year Liz Barre placed second, clearing 1.55 meters, while first-year Serena Li tied for third, having cleared 1.50 meters. Li also placed second in the long jump, her farthest mark measuring in at 4.98 meters. First-year Francine Leung placed sixth in the event, having jumped 4.77 meters. Leung also placed eighth in the triple jump with a distance of 9.61 meters, an event which also saw sophomore Samantha Johnson place fourth with a mark of 9.96 meters. Additionally, senior Michelle Karabin won the pole vault with a jump of 3.35 meters, as fellow senior Joanna Baranowski placed second, having successfully jumped 3.20 meters.
Junior Alessandra Tully placed sixth in the shot put with a distance of 10.47 meters, and seventh in the weight throw with a distance of 12.93 meters.
The women performed formidably on the track as well, with Samantha Giordani winning the 200-meter dash with a time of 25.77. Baranowski and Barre placed fifth and sixth with times of 27.65 and 27.78, respectively. Giordani also won the 400-meter dash, clocking in at 1:00.17, an event in which first-year Jasmine Fahrenkrug placed eighth with a time of 1:03.76. In the 60-meter hurdles, senior Leah Kendrick placed second, coming in at 9.48. Baranowski placed third with 9.56, and Barre placed fourth with 9.74.
In the 800-meter run, sophomore Taylor Jacobs placed second, finishing the race with a time of 2:25.81, as first-years Mona Yuan and Kavya Tummalapalli came in seventh and eighth with times of 2:29.47 and 2:31.35, respectively. The Tartan women also raced well in the mile run, with seniors Kathryn Reilly, Lacy Wade, and Valerie Collins placing second, third, and fifth clocking in at 5:15.97, 5:18.58, and 5:23.18, respectively. Senior Abigail Levine won the 3000-meter run, completing the race in a time of 10:31.76. In the same event, sophomore Kristen Seballos placed fourth with a time of 10:45.10, first-year Joyce Zhang placed sixth with a time of 10:56.87, and junior Parvathi Meyyappan placed eighth, at 11:03.64.
The Carnegie Mellon University women won the 4x400-meter relay. The A team comprised of Baranowski, Jacobs, Fahrenkrug, and Giordani clocked in at 4:12.36 — more than seven seconds faster than their closest competitor.
Overall, the women’s team placed second in the competition with a score of 157 points: just 4 points shy of first-place Washington and Lee University’s 161.
The Carnegie Mellon University men competed well, too. The long jump saw seniors Fred Dauphin and Dhroovaa Khannan come in sixth and seventh with distances of 6.14 meters and 6.12 meters, respectively. Khannan also placed sixth in the triple jump with an attempt measuring 12.48 meters. In the pole vault, junior Jon Murphy and sophomore Brian Lane placed fifth and eighth, respectively, with Murphy having cleared 4.05 meters and Lane having cleared 3.60 meters.
Freshman Bailey O’Malley won the shot put with a season’s best throw of 14.88 meters, a distance that puts him in sixth in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) Division III for this season. Additionally, O’Malley placed second in the weight throw, managing 14.59 meters, as teammate junior Logan Stahl won the event with a distance of 15.18 meters. Stahl’s attempt was also a season’s best, placing him in 16th in the ECAC.
On the track, the men matched their success on the field. The 200-meter dash saw first-year Zahir Saiyed place fifth with a time of 23.83 and Heoseph Desir place eighth with a time of 24.03. In the 400-meter dash, junior Michael Cai finished the race in fourth place, clocking in at 52.51, while Desir and Saiyed came in fifth and eighth at 52.86 and 53.43, respectively. The 60-meter hurdles then saw first-years Ian Daugherty and Noah Lynch place fifth and seventh with times of 9.06 and 9.17, respectively.
Sophomore Graham Eversden won the 800-meter run as fellow Tartan Evan Yukevich came in second. Clocking in at 1:55.99 and 1:59.00, respectively, the race was a season’s best for Eversden, whose time ranks third in the ECAC. In the mile run, senior Liam Walsh came in first with a time of 4:15.85, and first-year Elijah Sech placed fourth with a time of 4:24.39. These times are also season’s bests for both athletes and are ranked second and 31st in the ECAC.
The Tartan men swept the 3000-meter run. First-year Edward Goebel won the race with a phenomenal time of 8:39.66, with sophomore Naren Karur and first-year Michael Obroin finishing closely behind, Karur finishing at 8:40.10 and Obroin finishing at 8:44.30. Senior Harrison Branch-Shaw completed the race soon after, with a time of 8:46.07. All four athletes ran season’s bests, and their times are ranked seventh, eighth, nineteenth, and twenty-fourth in the ECAC, respectively.
The 5000-meter run saw sophomore Matthew Karee come in second, clocking in at 15:39.19: a season’s best time, ranked 23rd in the ECAC.
The Carnegie Mellon University men placed third in the 4x400-meter relay, with the A team consisting of Cai, Saiyed, Eversden, and Desir finishing the race in 3:28.50.
In the end, the Carnegie Mellon University men scored 148 points — over 10 more than their closest competitor — and placed first overall.
The Tartans now look forward to competing at Kent State University and Baldwin-Wallace College this Friday, Feb. 14.

The Super Bowl was received with plenty of anticipation as thousands gathered to watch the San Francisco 49ers take on the Kansas City Chiefs, millions more looking on from their homes across the country.
The 49ers won the coin toss but chose to defer, which allowed the Chiefs to start with the ball at the top of the first half. San Francisco started quite aggressively, giving Kansas City little choice but to punt the opening drive, garnering 62 yards in 10 plays. This featured a phenomenal 32-yard run by 49ers receiver Deebo Samuel. The drive was completed by Robbie Gould, whose 38-yard field goal gave San Francisco a 3 – 0 lead.
Kansas City responded, managing 75 yards in 15 plays, with Patrick Mahomes completing five of his seven attempted passes, totaling a considerable 40 yards, and Damien Williams rushing four times for 35 yards. The Chiefs faced 3rd and 11 on the 49ers’ 15-yard line and Mahomes scrambled across the first down line, but a hit from 49ers safety Jimmie Ward saw him fumble the ball. This resulted in the ball rolling backward and out-of-bounds which negated the first down, resulting in 4th and 1. A 4-yard run by Williams, however, was enough to convert the fourth down, and two plays later, Mahomes scored a 1-yard touchdown with just over half a minute left in the first quarter to make the score 7 – 3 in favor of the Chiefs.
The game remained tight in the second quarter. The second play of the quarter saw Kansas City’s defensive back Bashaud Breeland intercept 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo’s pass, resulting in the Chiefs getting their first down on their 44-yard line. Kansas City took full advantage of San Francisco’s mistake, and on the next play, Mahomes pulled out a 28-yard pass to Sammy Watkins. From this, the Chiefs began a 43-yard drive ending in a well-delivered 31-yard field goal by Harrison Butker. Extending Kansas City’s lead to 10 – 3.
However, the 49ers responded with fervor, and in just seven plays, the team moved the ball 80 yards, with over half the plays gaining more than 10 yards each. The final play saw a pass from Garoppolo caught by fullback Kyle Juszczyk, who dove into the endzone to score a 15-yard touchdown. With five minutes remaining in the second quarter, the score was tied at 10 – 10.
A 42-yard pass by Garoppolo then seemed to put San Francisco in the red zone, but a pass interference penalty was called. As a result, the teams went into halftime with the score still locked: the fourth time in Super Bowl history that the game has been tied at the halfway point.
Because of their deferral, the 49ers kicked off the second half and drove 60 yards in nine plays, with wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders catching two passes to give his team 20 yards. A 42-yard field goal, taken by Gould, gave San Francisco a 13 – 10 lead.
A well-practiced 62-yard kickoff by Mitch Wishnowsky returned by Mecole Hardman for an additional 15 yards brought the ball to the Chiefs’ 9-yard line, but a series of well-aimed passes by Mahomes put Kansas City back on their 46-yard line. However, an interception by San Francisco linebacker Fred Warner returned the ball to the 49ers’ 45-yard line. Garoppolo responded with equally accurate passing, with San Francisco’s drive ending in a catch by Juszczyk on the Chiefs’ 1-yard line and a run by Raheem Mostert into the end zone. With neither side gaining much distance in the remaining two and a half minutes, the 49ers ended the third quarter having extended their lead to 20 – 10.
The fourth quarter began with more back-and-forth. A drive, thanks to the efforts of Tyreek Hill and Williams along with Mahomes, got the ball from Kansas City’s 46-yard line to San Francisco’s 23-yard line. However, an interception by Tarvarius Moore stopped the Chiefs’ momentum, and Wishnowsky’s punt caught by Hardman, put the ball at Kansas City’s 17-yard line. With just about nine minutes left to play, the Chiefs fought back. Their following drive saw them gain 62 yards in 10 plays. A few plays later, a pass interference by Moore resulted in the ball moving to the 49ers’ 1-yard line, where a touchdown was quickly scored by Travis Kelce. Bringing the score to 20 – 17, the Chiefs closed the margin to just three points.
After a San Francisco punt, Kansas City drove 65 yards in seven plays, which saw a 38-yard pass from Mahomes to Watkins. On the 49ers’ 5-yard line, Mahomes then threw to Williams, who stretched to get the ball over the line before going out of bounds. Although the margin was minuscule, the call was upheld after close review, making the score 24 – 20, granting the Chiefs a 4-point lead.
Although the 49ers put in a strong drive in response, Garoppolo made several incomplete passes before being sacked. This meant a turnover with just over a minute and a half left in the game. For the next two plays, the ball was carried by Williams who, on the second play, made a fantastic 38-yard run into the endzone for another touchdown, increasing Kansas City’s lead to 31 – 20 with a little over a minute left to play.
An interception by Kendall Fuller on San Francisco’s drive meant that the Chiefs could run out the clock and secure their first Super Bowl in half a century, and their second Super Bowl overall.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Patrick Mahomes received the title of MVP, becoming the youngest quarterback to ever do so. In total, he completed 26 passes out of 42 attempts for a grand total of 286 yards, in which there were two touchdowns and two interceptions. Additionally, he rushed for a 29 yards and a touchdown. Truly, a great performance.

This is Penalty Shouts, The Tartan’s sports column inspired by the The New Yorker’s column Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled column will focus on anything and everything funny in the sports world that is deserving of our comedic attention. 
It’s been a crazy year in college basketball, and the University of North Carolina (UNC) showed us that there is at least one normal thing this season: an overtime loss on a putback with less than a second to go after UNC blows a lead in the last few minutes of regular time and gives up three points in two seconds on when Duke University starts those two seconds at the free throw line.
Just like clockwork, UNC loses to Duke everywhere in that exact same manner. This year when it happened, UNC coach Roy Williams said, “Coach K can win all he wants, but he will never, ever be able to dunk on me.” Coach K used his superpower to hear things from miles away (it’s what makes him such a good coach) to overhear Williams’ comment.
Seventy-two-year-old Coach K sprinted to the UNC locker room before anybody could say “Duke sucks” and challenged Roy Williams to a dunk contest. Appropriately, Roy Williams was confused. Then, he realized Coach K must have overheard his previous comment, so Williams accepted the challenge. At 69 (heh) years old, Williams was young and spry compared to Coach K’s insane 72 years. It was an assured win for Williams.
They walked out into an empty Dean Smith Center after the tragic loss of the Tar Heels to the Blue Devils in overtime (and all of the other qualifiers). The agreed-upon rules of the game established that whoever had the cooler dunk would win. They would go back and forth dunking until someone was a clear winner. The coaches shook hands at mid-court.
On Roy Williams’ first dunk, he threw himself an alley-oop. He bounced it off the rafters, through the top rows of seating, against the scoreboard, and off the side of the backboard, à la the Larry Bird and Michael Jordan commercial where they hit nothing but net, and Williams threw it down after jumping from the free throw line. For a 69 year old man, it was impressive. But not impressive enough.
Coach K lined up his dunk. He asked Roy Williams to stand in the key. Looking back on it, Williams said, “I probably should have asked why he wanted me to stand in the key.” Coach K lobbed the ball up. He ran forward from the three-point line and vaulted himself over the silken white hair of Roy Williams. For a second, Williams saw his life flash before his eyes. Then, it was over. Coach K dunked on Roy Williams.
According to a tweet from a UNC player after the game and the dunk, Roy Williams was in shambles: “Overheard in UNC locker room after game: ‘He got me,’ Roy Williams said of Coach K’s dunk over him. ‘That f***ing Coach K boomed me.’ Roy Williams added, ‘He’s so good,’ repeating it four times. Roy Williams then said he wanted to add Coach K to the list of players he works out with this summer.”

Last Monday’s Iowa caucuses were a disturbing parable for the risks to our democracy. Moreover, it exposed how Iowa’s niche status is hazardously clunky in the 21st century.
A week later, it is still unclear what exactly went wrong. What is known is that the Democratic party intended to have the captains at each voting precinct report the results of each caucus using an app developed by Shadow, Inc. There were reports suggesting that the app was untested and the captains were untrained, and now, there is news that pro-Trump trolls may have intentionally jammed the phone lines to prevent Democrats from using their hotline as a fail-safe. Even now, the results are in doubt. The infinitesimal gap between Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders has led to both candidates declaring victory and numerous accusations of election rigging.
“There has been a lot of work in the security community and the crypto-community to design more secure voting systems, but those are still in the preliminary testing stage. Voting systems are complex; you need to worry about physical attacks on the system itself, and as soon as you connect them to the internet, that information might be tampered with or lost or scooped on,” said Bryan Parno, associate professor of Computer Science and Electrical Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, “On top of that, even if we security experts give our blessing, it’s not necessarily the best way to rest the foundation of a democratic system on. The system has to be not only secure, but also known to be secure. If people don’t think that it is secure or believe that it might have been tampered with, that is just as bad.”
Iowa’s caucus system is incredibly complex due to the multiple tiers of delegate allocation mechanisms. In short, rather than simply casting a ballot, the voters in each precinct gather and stand in clumps and convince others of their community to join them, with candidates under 15 percent having their votes redistributed. At the end of it all, the captains were meant to report the delegate outcome, along with the raw votes before and after redistribution.
So at first glance, a tech injection would appear to be just what Iowa needed. Instead, it only caused more mayhem. “After the 2000 election, there was this big rush to do computerized voter machines, and I think that was overly hasty … Part of the push for digitizing everything is that people want the results right away, which is nice to have but not necessary,” Parno explained.
Aside from technological issues, the Iowa caucuses were marred by issues of representation. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Iowa is 91 percent white compared to the national statistic of 77 percent, and according to Pew research, the Democratic party is only 59 percent white nationally. This means that Iowa is not representative of the entire country, and especially not of the current Democratic party.
The caucus system is also unrepresentative due to the effort required to attend. It is an hours-long ordeal whose rules are difficult to summarize succinctly, as opposed to a primary where all one has to do is fill out a ballot. As a result, there are many who simply cannot attend a caucus for logistical reasons (jobs, childcare, etc.), and many who would vote but don’t want to go through the whole ordeal. For this reason and others, the number of Democratic caucuses decreased from 14 in 2016 to just four in 2020. In the end, only about 170,000 attended the democratic caucuses in a state of roughly 3.1 million.
Iowa Democrats had hoped to address the accessibility issues by also holding a “virtual” caucus by phone, in order to comply with new DNC regulations mandating ease of voting. However, the plan was tossed out last fall due to hacking concerns and replaced with “satellite” caucuses, which allowed Iowans out of state or abroad to vote in person without being at their assigned precinct back in Iowa. This did close to nothing to address the systemic reasons why the Iowa caucus is logistically inconvenient.
“A system that tries to get people talking to each other is not necessarily a bad thing, but it leads to some logistical challenges,” Parno said. As for the app attempting to streamline this archaic system, “Like any other technological product, if you are rolling something out that’s crucial to get right the first time, then there’s all kinds of standard software engineering disciplines you should be following: good specifications, good development process, testing, beta testing, trying it out with real users. If you skip any of those tests it is more likely that something is going to go wrong. And when something involves security, all of that has to be with security in mind. You can’t typically take your software that was designed without security in mind and slap on some security,” Parno said.

A study conducted by Northwestern Medicine and Cornell University demonstrated that there is a connection between the consumption of processed red meat and heart disease. The research contradicts a controversial study from last fall that claimed there is no need to cut red meat from the diet. 
According to the study, published on Feb. 3 in JAMA Internal Medicine, having two servings of red or processed meat or poultry per week was associated with a three to seven percent increase in the risk of being diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. Eating red meat or processed meat two times a week was correlated with a three percent increase in the risk of dying by any means. 
“It's a small difference, but it's worth trying to reduce red meat and processed meat like pepperoni, bologna and deli meats,” said senior author Norrina Allen in a press release. Allen is an associate professor of preventive medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. “Red meat consumption also is consistently linked to other health problems like cancer.”
“Modifying intake of these animal protein foods may be an important strategy to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and premature death at a population level,” explained Victor Zhong, an assistant professor of nutritional sciences at Cornell. 
A meta-analysis published last November has proven controversial since its authors argued that people do not have to reduce how much processed meat and red meat they consume. 
“Everyone interpreted that it was OK to eat red meat, but I don't think that is what the science supports,” said Allen. Zhong agreed, adding, “Our study shows the link to cardiovascular disease and mortality was robust.”
Overall, the researchers surveyed over 26,000 individuals with a mean age of 53.7 years. Follow-up results of up to three decades were included. However, there were some limitations in the data collection methods. The participants self-reported their diet data as they were questioned on what they ate for the last year. The researchers did not consider cooking method as a factor in diet, and only assessed participants’ meat intake once, even though there may have been a change in their behaviors over time.
In addition to red meat, the study positively associated poultry intake with cardiovascular disease. Though the data is insufficient to make a concrete recommendation about consuming poultry, Zhong still suggests that people refrain from eating fried chicken.
As many begin to question the role of red meat in their diets after the results of this study, the authors explored healthier alternatives. Co-author Linda Van Horn, a Feinberg professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern and member of the 2020 U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, said, “Fish, seafood and plant-based sources of protein such as nuts and legumes, including beans and peas, are excellent alternatives to meat and are under-consumed in the U.S.”

In 2016, scientists reported that exposure to influenza viruses during childhood can give people partial protection against distantly related influenza strains for the rest of their lives. The idea that past exposure to the flu virus determines a person's response to future infections, also known as "immunological imprinting,” overturned the belief that exposure to flu virus produced no immunological production. This sparked a series of interesting yet puzzling findings by researchers.
Two subtypes of influenza virus, H1N1 and H3N2, are common types of flu that have caused a number of seasonal outbreaks over the past decades. H1N1 is more likely to affect young and middle-aged adults. H3N2 is more dangerous than H1N1, considered high risk for the elderly, leads to more hospitalization than H1N1, and causes the majority of deaths from flu. Every year, H3N2 alone kills an estimated 36,000 people in the U.S. According to health record data, exposure to the diseases at an early childhood stage would generate a lifelong impact to a child’s immunity.
According to the Arizona Department of Health Services, people first exposed to the less severe strain, H1N1, during childhood are less vulnerable to H1N1. They are less likely to be impacted by H1N1 if they encounter it later on in their lives compared to people who were first exposed to H3N2. At the same time, people first exposed to H3N2 received extra protection against H3N2 later in life. 
By examining the evolutionary relationships of the two strains of flu, scientists learned that H1N1 and H3N2 belong to two separate branches on the influenza family tree. This means that if an immune system has fought one of the two diseases, it cannot fight the other disease as easily because the other disease is new to the immune system. 
However, medical records also revealed that people whose first childhood exposure was to H2N2 did not have a protective advantage when they later encountered H1N1, even though H2N2 and H1N1 are close relatives to each other. This indicates the difficulty for our immune system to recognize and defend against some closely related strains of diseases, particularly the flu. Scientists realized that our immune system response applies to some strains the same, but others quite differently. 
Currently, scientists are studying immunity against bird flu due to the breadth of our immune system response to those strains, hoping to apply their discoveries to fighting seasonal flu, which has a more severe impact on the general population. Researchers also hope their findings could help predict which age groups might be severely affected during future flu seasons based on the subtype circulating. With this information, we could find ourselves in a future where health officials can prepare their responses allowing people to receive personalized vaccines available in limited quantities.

As an important cultural critic, I’d like to begin my magnum opus by declaring that there are three genres of Super Bowl ads. Over and over again, Super Bowl advertisements fall into three discrete categories. There’s some overlap in which generic tropes are used in a commercial — imagine a Venn diagram.
In the first circle, there is the All-American ad. This commercial is nostalgic for those olden days of Americana. It’s Iowa. It’s farm hands and rootin’ tootin’ cowboys. There’s a Sam Elliott voice-over, an American flag, and a pickup truck. Really, it’s America.
At their best, these commercials are about beer and trucks. The Budweiser Clydesdale commercials fall into this category. This past year, Budweiser ran a “Typical American” commercial, and really, it’s a typical American Super Bowl ad. At their worst, these commercials are political advertisements (looking at you, Michael Bloomberg and Donald Trump).
The second category is the musical commercial category. These commercials feature famous musical artists or songs, or use a sick beat to sell a product. With the recent growth of hip hop, these commercials often feature artists like Beyonce, Rihanna, Missy Elliott, or Jay-Z. They’ll sing a little ditty, and the salable product will be bright and very visible.
A fine specimen of the musical commercial is Missy Elliott’s Pepsi Zero commercial this past year. It isn’t particularly interesting, but it is the perfect example of a musical commercial. They take a famous song (”Paint it Black” by The Rolling Stones), make it into a ‘hip hop’ remix, and put a famous hip hop artist on it to perform. All the while, the product is made into an interesting visual element. In this scenario, a red cola can is painted black and turned into Pepsi. Frankly, it’s hard to get a musical commercial wrong. It’s simple. You just have to make sure you’re not going to pick a song from Loveless.
Finally, the last grouping is the Hollywood group. The Hollywood group uses famous actors, allusions to famous movies, or a combination of both (recognizable actors that act as allusions to their movie) to sell their product. It’s great to have fame on your side. This past year alone, there were a series of allusions to westerns, The Shining, Men in Black, Fargo, Stranger Things, and many, many more.
What makes the Hollywood commercial special, however, is the dependency on the allusion to sell the product. For example, Chris Evans in the “Smaht Pahk” commercial is what’s being used to sell cars in the ad. There was a parody of The Shining, too, where Bryan Cranston played all parts: the twins, Jack Torrance, etc. Commercials like this can even be just a choice of color palette or design of the commercial. There were an odd amount of commercials that looked like Stranger Things or similar futurist horror designs.
There are also commercials that overlap in their generic tropes. Some commercials are musical and Hollywood commercials. They use famous actors as dancers in the ad, or they have a famous actor lip-sync the song. Some commercials overlap by using famous actors who represent the core values of America—Clint Eastwood, Sam Elliott, etc. Some commercials are American through and through, so they include famous American folk and country music like “Yankee Doodle” or “America, the Beautiful” or “Old Town Road.”
Speaking of “Old Town Road”, the Doritos commercial with Lil Nas X, Billy Ray Cyrus, and Sam Elliott epitomized the center of this venn diagram where American, Hollywood, and musical commercials overlap. It features a western generic trope reference, Sam Elliott, and a famous hip hop and pop cultural song that features a famous country artist. It even begins with an iconic reference to a western that surely everyone remembers: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. That commercial is peak Super Bowl advertisement.
While breaking down the Super Bowl commercials was a fun exercise in cultural analysis, it’s really not that real. More frequently, it seems like these commercials and their related cultural items come from a singular brain of gelatinous goo filled with the musical trills and special visual effect elements that titillate our sensory receptors. Even then, it’s, like, whatever man. We like it. So like, stopping looking that deep, bro.

At first, I was skeptical about Shakira and J. Lo performing the Super Bowl halftime show. To my knowledge, it had been quite a while since either of them released new music, or since I’d even heard them on the radio. Then, I found out the Super Bowl would take place in my hometown, Miami, which is basically Northern Cuba, and it all made sense. Miami is the Hispanic hotspot, it’s our city. Of course the show should reflect the culture that’s surrounding it. So naturally, I got excited. After a couple weeks of anticipation, the time finally arrived for the halftime show to roll out on screen. During and after the performance, the only word that popped into my head was: wow. It was absolutely stunning. J. Lo is still Jenny from the block, and Shakira’s hips?! Girl. They don’t lie. Some were unimpressed, but there are a significant amount of reasons to reconsider that perspective.
First of all, let us take into account that Jennifer Lopez is 50 years old. 50. Shakira is 43. Their undeniable talent is remarkably still out of this world, even past their heyday in the entertainment industry. They dance, sing, and perform with the same vibrance and energy I grew up watching them display on screen. I don’t know about you, but I’m hoping I look and dance that good when I reach my 50s. What they did, given their age and the fact that they have several children, was unbelievably impressive.
Having two Latinas lead the halftime show, with guest appearances from Bad Bunny and JBalvin, is also something to be celebrated in and of itself. It was an entirely Latinx halftime show. The diversity that exists within Hispanic cultures was, on top of that, delivered to the audience with nothing short of excellent style and taste. Shakira unapologetically embraced her Colombian nationality and Arabic roots, and she paid homage to African pop culture with “Waka Waka” at the end of the show. As her daughter sang a song about living in the U.S. and lines of young hispanic girls surrounded them, J. Lo took on a large feathery Puerto Rican flag with the American flag printed behind it, a political statement commenting on embracing one’s dual identity with pride as a Hispanic born in the U.S.
The representation that seeped through the performances just astounded me. Both J. Lo and Shakira have served as one of the only substantial forms of female Hispanic representation in the media for me as a Cuban-American woman (other than the legendary Celia Cruz), and for countless others as well. I was proud to see that the same Shakira whose dance moves I imitated as a child in my living room is still working and thriving as I go through college. It reminded me of the power that Hispanic-American women manifest to defy the odds on a daily basis; it reminded me of the strength of the female spirit rooted in our culture; it reminded me that the grind doesn’t stop for us when success finally meets us; it reminded me of the perseverance that runs through the veins of generations of Hispanic women who defied the previous odds for us, and never took no as an answer.
These women are mothers, performers, singers, dancers, intellectuals, humanitarians, and Latinas. They stride in the beauty and confidence that I’ve seen shine in every Hispanic woman I’ve met and in the ones I was raised by. It is safe to say that, after watching that halftime show filled with admiration over the capabilities of two Hispanic women, I was as proud of my ethnicity and my identity as ever before.

To say that James Bond is an icon of cinema would be an understatement — he’s done much more than inspire the creation of Indiana Jones and change the way people order martinis. He’s become the leading man of one of the longest-running movie franchises of all time, only to be bested by the ​*Godzilla*​ movies and the ​*Carry On* films. However, with ​*No Time to Die​* releasing in April 2020, it might be time for us to break away from this bond.
Beginning from literary roots, James Bond was the brainchild of British novelist Ian Fleming, first appearing in ​*Casino Royale​*, the 1953 literary basis for the 1967 film. He was characterized as a smooth-talking, intelligent, and savvy special agent with a weakness for dry martinis and pretty women. For some people, he’s basically Barney Stinson from ​*How I Met Your Mother* with no wingman. And for decades, moviegoers have adored this onscreen persona with their hearts and souls. Some people love Bond so much that film-makers like Spielberg and de Palma have used Agent 007 as the basis for their own characters, like Indiana Jones from the titular series and Ethan Hunt from ​*Mission Impossible*​.
On the other hand, many of today’s popular films have taken significant deviations from the fantasy-like trope that Bond has presented. For evidence, look no further than the nominees for Best Picture for 2020, and possibly some of their leading roles. Films like ​Joker, Parasite,​ and ​*The Irishman*​ all have presented characters that audiences find to be more realistic, even finding hatred for them at times. While superhero, larger-than-life characters still rule the box office, much like Avengers: Endgame did in 2019, they seem to be critically usurped by the imperfect, flawed, and much more realistic protagonists.
In addition, many of James Bond’s movies have become rather problematic in today’s day and age, mostly due to a renewed focus on women’s rights. The term ‘Bond girl’ went from being a symbol of glamour to a symbol of feminist regression, and as long as James Bond films keep treating women the same way in films like ​*Goldfinger* or ​*Spectre​*, there might be no hope for No Time to Die​ in the critics’ books or the reviewers’ blogs.
From the surface, the trailer of ​No​ ​Time to Die seemed to be taking a different lens from the Bond films’ usual plotline. This 2020 flick presents a new plotline of Bond’s female companion hiding a dark secret, but this seems like a sorry attempt to allure viewers who claim to want ‘nuanced female characters’. Besides this, ​*No Time to Die​* relies on the same old spectacle of explosions and villainous banter, rather than presenting something novel.
This isn’t to say that James Bond’s films can’t be enjoyed as classics from time to time. No matter what, they will always remain as pieces of cinematic history. However, ​*No Time to Die*​ doesn’t seem like a film with high hopes given its time of release and seemingly unoriginal plot. I certainly wouldn’t trust this man with a license to kill.

If we are going to talk about mental health in movies, we need to address the billion-dollar elephant in the room: Joker. Since Oct., I have come to really dislike the film for its bad script. It does not hold up upon repeat viewings, and its commentary on class warfare and social decay doesn’t work. The film’s commentary on mental illness, however, falls incredibly hard on its face.
Throughout the various iterations of the iconic character, the Joker’s mental illness has never been front and center. He was just a guy who made loads of mistakes, and it took one bad day for him to just stop caring about everything and become the villain. However, this film has a different approach, which it spells out during the talk show sequence.
“What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? You get what you fucking deserve.”
I include the last part in there because that’s the kicker. It’s basically saying you must treat people with mental illness nicely or they’ll go “crazy” and kill you, and it’s your fault when that happens. It is very reminiscent of the media narrative that is perpetrated about mass shootings since Columbine, minus the “it’s your fault” part.
Sure, some violent killers may have some mental illness. But it’s not like every mentally ill person who gets bullied or isolated will come back and commit some act of violence. Unfortunately, the case is often the opposite — mentally ill people are more likely to hurt themselves than anyone else and be victims of violence. Joker showcases this, but it gets overshadowed by the ambiguous finale and over-reliance on the Joker’s mental health for his spree of violence.
To some of the film’s credit, it does talk about Reagan-era budget cuts for mental health facilities and social workers. But it somehow makes it worse that the film is trying to have it both ways. It tries to be a sensitive and nuanced story about someone with mental illness but also conflates mental illness with violence.
It reminds me of 13 Reasons Why to a certain degree, albeit Joker is much better than that garbage show. Joker feels like something that’s trying to be a “conversation starter” without much nuance within the story to discuss it. But now that we are on the subject of 13 Reasons Why, let’s talk about that.
The initial story is already wrong for so many reasons, from its portrayal of PTSD to the unnecessarily graphic suicide scene to how it makes Hannah a martyr with her suicide. But the second season goes to a whole new level. There is an entire subplot dedicated to a depressed character who is abused and bullied, begins to recover, gets assaulted in another tastelessly graphic scene, and then decides to shoot up the school. All of that is just wrong, and it’s super obvious why.
Part of the stigma with mental health in entertainment is how sensationalized it is, particularly the narrative of someone going “crazy” or “mad”. 13 Reasons Why is the worst example I can think of, but there are other examples of it in great movies I love, such as Black Swan and The Shining. I’ll give those films way more of a pass because it’s part of a larger story not focused on mental health, and is portrayed much better than something like 13 Reasons Why.
But the sensationalist treatment of mental illness is important to consider. No matter how hard we try, we are influenced by the culture around us. If our entertainment and media bog us down with negative stigmas of mental health, subtly or overtly, we are influenced by that. Personally speaking, I have looked down on my own mental health issues because of the negative perception that has been developed over the years.
I’ll name drop other famous movies that are part of this: Fatal Attraction, Girl, Interrupted, Psycho, and Shutter Island. The list goes on and on. I could keep talking about movies and shows that do it wrong. But, I’d rather talk about the ones that do it right, starting with Taxi Driver.
Taxi Driver was a huge source of inspiration for Joker. Travis Bickle is a lonely Vietnam War veteran with clear mental health issues frustrated with the social decay around him. His attempts to connect with people are in vain, and he doesn’t have a support system at all. He has a toxic view of the world that is separate from his mental health, and it is an extreme reflection of the social status quo and the system that breeds the toxic masculinity he embraces. In many ways, that toxic view of the world is what facilitates his declining mental health. Because of his self-radicalization, his view of himself as misunderstood is amplified to an unhealthy degree.
The violence at the end is not a byproduct of his mental health either, and Travis is not depicted as crazy or mad. Rather, he has taken his already radical views to the logical extreme. As he deteriorates further and becomes consumed in his desire to be recognized by the two women he obsesses over, he uses violence as the resort for recognition. First he tries to assassinate the senator his love interest works for, but when that fails, he decides to play a “hero” and kill the men who abuse the child prostitute he befriends.
There is a lot that can be unpacked from this about mental health, particularly the way we don’t have the patience for those we deem outcasts. Joker has a few of these elements, but it’s a very shallow exploration of these concepts. We Need To Talk About Kevin has a similar nuanced exploration of twisted viewpoints, how they can be enabled by people who are trying to support them, and how that has an impact on the character’s mental health.
Bojack Horseman and Mr. Robot are two TV shows that, while incredibly stylized, manage to have very substantive and sensitive stories about recovery while going out of their way to accurately depict the mental health issues the characters have. The shows also never use the characters’ mental health as flaws, which many movies and shows do. The flaws the characters have are separate from their mental illnesses, and often make their mental health issues worse because they influence the way the characters feel about themselves.
Horror movies are usually bad with mental health, but Ari Aster’s Hereditary and Midsommar are both incredible movies that depict mental health really well, especially in relation to grief and trauma. Hereditary also explores the hereditary nature of mental illness, and Midsommar has a powerful depiction of the importance of good support systems. It helps that the metaphorical aspects of the story work to enhance the overall exploration of the themes and concepts.
Generally, the treatment of mental health in entertainment is improving a lot. But it is still irritating when films like Joker don’t treat the subject matter with the respect and nuance it deserves, even if the intent is good. Luckily, the film’s intent is not lost on a lot of people, so that’s a good sign. But we still deserve better, and I hope the entertainment industry takes more ideas from the movies and shows that do it well rather than the ones that don’t.

This review contains spoilers.
When I saw 1917 listed as a nominee for the Golden Globes, I initially thought it had no chance of winning Best Picture. It’s just a war movie, I thought. That was all I knew about it: It’s a war movie, and how could a war movie win? In this day and age, with so many pressing and relevant issues to be conveyed in cinema, how could a movie set over 100 years ago take the award? Not only did it garner a nomination for Best Picture, but also for Best Director, the two most prestigious awards given. Still, it can’t be that good, or so I believed.
Upon seeing 1917, it really is that good. The truth is that it’s not “just a war movie.” It is a wonderfully crafted story of compassion and hate, determination and resignation, trust and betrayal, pain and pleasure, embedded in the context of the First World War. Obviously the entire framework of the movie is dependent on this context, but the aforementioned themes are what come through stronger. They are stronger than the superficial violence and gore that come with any war movie — which this film certainly shows — and they are what separates 1917 from others.
In just under two hours, director Sam Mendes brings us along on the journey of a lonely mission from one British battalion to another in order to deliver an important message, crossing enemy lines to do so. The two soldiers who embark on this perilous mission, played by the relatively unknown George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman, are followed by what appears to be one long continuous shot in trenches, into pits, past barbed wire fences, and through the decaying French countryside. Lance Corporal Blake (Chapman) has a personal stake in the matter, as his brother is in immediate danger if the message is not delivered. But when Blake is murdered by an enemy German pilot after the two help him escape his destroyed plane, Lance Corporal Scoffield (MacKay) is forced to continue the journey alone.
It is here that the movie reaches its first heartbreaking moment, as Scoffield holds the dying and scared Blake, one of his best friends, in his arms. What is striking here is the fragility of the soldier’s veil of courage, as well as the fragility of their own lives. Just minutes before, Blake had been reminiscing about the comforts of home, and before that, he had saved Scoffield from a collapsing barrack. Mendes does a fantastic job projecting a sense of true humanity onto these two men through things as small as a voice crack when describing the pain of leaving home or as significant as attempts to help a fallen enemy soldier. It makes the scene that much more heart-wrenching.
Up to this point, the atmosphere was already extremely potent and dense, but it becomes even more so when Scoffield leaves his dead friend behind. A sense of weight and raw reality are emphasized, particularly by a brilliant shot of Scoffield gazing with dead eyes while soldiers around him joke and laugh in a vehicle. The audience is made aware of how alone he feels, even among these comrades, and now looks upon this atmosphere through the cold and unforgiving lens of death. It drives home the idea that the only comfort for these soldiers in this barren landscape are the others with them, but even then, they can feel so hopeless.
Scoffield does not lose hope, however. Instead, he continues on his journey, finding cover from the German guns in a small basement of a war torn town. This beautiful moment slightly lessens the almost overbearing sense of despair that has been accumulating. Scoffield finds that this basement is inhabited by a terrified mother and her lone infant, whom Scoffield consoles gently. There’s both pain in his eyes and hope that the world isn’t as cruel as what he’s been so violently exposed to. Similar to Blake’s previous lighthearted jokes, Mendes supplies a brief interlude — a glimpse into a simpler and tamer reality than that of the war — before plunging us right back into the turmoil.
Soon after leaving, Scoffield is shot, which powerfully cuts the scene for the first time in the entire movie. What follows is one of the best transitional scenes I have ever seen. Scoffield frantically sprints through the streets of the crumpled town amid gunshots rattling and flares illuminating the sky. The scene is brilliantly oriented to feel surreal, like being trapped in a nightmare, which is what the war was for so many. The maze-like streets and stark lighting used contribute greatly to this effect.
In the end, Scoffield makes it to the British front in a dazed, exhausted, and grieving state. Mendes applies another fantastic change of pace when Scoffield stops to sit by a tree and listen to a soldier sing a somber folk tune. No one says anything of the new arrival; no one even turns a head. It is a moment of pause, to reflect on the whirlwind of action and drama to which the audience has just been subjected. Simultaneously, there is a sense that this moment must come to an end, just as with the scene in the basement. An underlying tension is present, knowing that we have not reached the end. Personally, I could feel the soreness in my legs and the deep wish to keep sitting by that tree and listening to the song. The moment ends, and now, Scoffield must find the general and deliver the message. He is successful. The attack is called off. But it’s not before the first wave of soldiers is sent in an epic scene where Scoffield sprints perpendicular to the advance that he is trying to prevent.
He also finds Lance Corporal Blake’s brother, and he must deliver another message. In a heartbreaking (albeit clichè) dialogue, the two unfamiliar men form a bond over the loss of their fallen brother, friend, and soldier, strengthening the sense of camaraderie built throughout the film.
Using wonderful changes of atmosphere, tone, and pace, Mendes creates an immersive and impactful cinematic experience that you don’t want to miss.

The snow sparkled in the bright lights of Stage AE as it fell, blowing over us as it was carried by the breeze. It was roughly 28 degrees and the line to get inside the venue nearly went around the block, but the winter weather did not stop anyone from going all out with their outfits. Glittering sheer tops, leopard coats, and colorful sportswear adorned the crowd of young women/non-binary people anxiously waiting to get inside — dressed to the nines for their gay icon, musician King Princess.
​I had the opportunity to see Kilo Kish and King Princess at Stage AE last Saturday as part of her Cheap Queen tour, and it was truly a restorative experience. As a longtime fan, King Princess has stood for everything I had hoped, and everything I currently hope for — a youth fully embracing and owning her sexuality and her gayness — and to see her live was an experience like no other.
​
But before King Princess herself entered the stage, the concert threw the audience into the experience known as Kilo Kish. She’s an artist who has been on the electronica art-pop scene for nearly a decade, having produced 5 EPs and a studio album with artists like Childish Gambino and A$AP Ferg. The audience had no introduction, no time to get acquainted with the woman in the ruffled pink dress in front of them, but all eyes were on her as she sang and danced to industrial hip hop beats. Performing her hit songs “Like Honey,” “Elegance,” and “Bite Me,” Kilo Kish was truly electrifying. White light panels flashed behind her along to the thumping bass — so deep that you could feel it in your heart — spelling out her name onstage. Large swaths of fuchsia and cool technology-blue saturated the stage, each color fully dominating her and her single accompaniment. The accompaniment, a multi-instrumentalist and producer, pounded on various sound boards to produce all of Kilo Kish’s electro-pop sounds live. It was honestly reminiscent of those dark, neon futuristic dance clubs you’d see in sci-fi movies, and it was incredibly cool. Kilo Kish had all the swagger of Azealia Banks and the cool factor of Icona Pop, balancing out a cute e-girl look with heavier, futuristic dance/house hip hop beats. If you’re curious to hear more of Kilo Kish, check out her latest EP, REDUX, released Dec. 2019.
​
The energy from Kilo Kish’s performance carried over into drag queen Bambi Qween’s lip sync performance. Dressed in tiered lavender ruffled pants, Bambi Qween vogued, walked, and danced, earning high-pitched screams of support from the audience. It was a small taste of ballroom culture, an LGBTQ+ subculture built by African-American and Latinx-American people.
​
And then, after some minor tech changes, the King herself appeared — King Princess. Though she matched the energy of the previous two performances, her songs brought out more of the emotional pain of heartbreak and love, particularly within the LGBTQ+ community. Though only 21, she walked on that stage with the presence of an old rock star, effortlessly cool and breezy. Dressed in a white halter top and a black skirt layered over bright red pants, she fully embraced a non-gender conforming look – both streetwear inspired and easy to move around in. Somehow, she’s even cooler onstage/in person than she is in her music or interview videos.
King Princess performed nearly every single song from her recent album, Cheap Queen, including songs like “Ain’t Together” (a personal favorite), “Hit the Back,” and of course, her hit single “1950.” Each time a song started the audience would gasp and cheer with every ounce of energy they had in their body. We collectively swayed to solemn bitter songs of heartbreak, danced hard to more pop-like songs about love, and head-banged our way through a yet-unreleased rock-heavy song. I have yet to go to a concert that bridged such a wide range of genres and musical talent, and King Princess has mastered them all.
There were some major concert highlights in King Princess’s performance. Hearing “Pussy is God” live and the lyrics screamed by a room of queer women was honestly life-changing (to be so confident and strong and open about being queer!), as was watching King Princess throw her guitar on the ground and stomping on it a la Jimi Hendrix and seeing her stand atop the piano and shredding on the guitar. All of this is to say, she’s an incredibly talented and skilled performer, and her innate talents and schooling at USC really showed.
Best of all, I think, is that there is just something so reaffirming about being a space that is so welcoming and celebratory of your community. King Princess is often hailed as a gay icon, noticeably gender-fluid in her style and openly queer. It was clear that she knew what it meant to be in a venue made mostly of LGBTQ+ youth, and she proudly holds that mantle high.
Maybe this is just an internet thing, but a surprisingly large number of the Millennial and Gen Z LGBTQ+ community experience their “teenage years” during their 20s. Usually, this is a result of the lack of visible queer artists in our youth – there wasn’t much to point to, and the uncertainty that clouded our actual teenage years in a way prolongs an embracing of identity. Having spent my actual teenage years unsure about my sexuality and concerned about safely being open about it, I’ve found that my 20s are becoming my “gay teens.” In other words, the joy, the embarrassment, the frustration – all of the emotional highs and lows of being young and in love are happening later in life because so much of it was suppressed. Seeing King Princess, someone who doesn’t have to do that – who doesn’t have to prolong their embracing of their identity, someone who can live out the experiences and emotions of their teenage years in their actual teenage years, was all at once heart-warming and re-affirming. She represents a new generation of LGBTQ+ artists making music about their community for their community, and it is truly wonderful to be a part of that experience.
My friends and I walked out of Stage AE feeling our energy restored and feeling proud to have experienced the night with King Princess. We were proud to have celebrated who we are, because that’s what a King Princess concert is – a celebration of queer youth.
To hear more about King Princess, check out her newest album Cheap Queen, and keep your eyes and ears open for Cheap Queen Deluxe, releasing sometime in 2020. She will be touring in Europe with Harry Styles in the latter part of the year.

As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases grows, governments and administrations have been taking preventive measures to protect the general public from further spread of the virus, including restricting travel to China. Carnegie Mellon University is no different. Recently, the university has begun taking precautionary actions to protect the community from possible infection of coronavirus.
On Jan. 22, University Health Services (UHS) sent an email to members of the Carnegie Mellon community regarding the coronavirus outbreak. Dr. Beth Kotarski, the Executive Director of UHS, advised the community to take health precautions, including washing hands, staying home when sick, covering coughs and sneezes, getting plenty of rest, and getting the seasonal flu vaccine.
In a statement to The Tartan, Dr. Kotarski stressed the importance of hand washing: “It’s not too far off the mark to say that hand-washing literally flushes germs down the drain… if everyone on campus reading this would make a personal commitment to hand-washing frequently (every few hours and before and after every meal, lavatory use, after coughing or sneezing), then we would all benefit.”
Along with advising the community to take health precautions, UHS reported that they were “monitoring the emerging facts about the disease and working very closely with the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) to understand and enact best practices for screening and treating any student who may report with symptoms.” Although there are few cases confirmed in the United States, “the concern with this virus is that it is new, and therefore health officials do not have experience with its long-term effects.”
One week later, an email from Provost James Garrett and Gina Casalegno, Dean of Students and Vice President for Student Affairs, announced that Carnegie Mellon had issued a restriction on all Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, and staff from traveling to China for university purposes. They strongly advised those who were traveling to China for personal reasons to reconsider, following the U.S. State Department’s restriction on travel to China.
“Out of an abundance of caution,” the university asked that “anyone who has traveled to China within the last 14 days to immediately self-isolate before coming to campus,” and that “any student with fever and cough who has been to China within the last 14 days should report to, or call University Health Services.”
On Monday, Feb. 3, President Farnam Jahanian followed up with an email urging the community to come together in support for those who have been affected by coronavirus: “Let’s look out for each other, be extra kind to others and lend a helping hand, or a listening ear, to ensure the well-being of every member in our community.”
Maureen Dasey-Morales, Associate Vice President for Community Health and Well-Being, told The Tartan that people who have been distressed because of the virus can also turn to resources provided by the university. “Student Affairs staff, including house fellows, college liaisons, residence life staff, CaPS, the Office of the Dean of Students, and Community Health and Well-Being staff are all available to provide support and have been reaching out to persons that may need additional support,” she said.
As President Jahanian wrote to The Tartan, “Together, we need to support those members of the CMU community who are experiencing high stress, whether they’re directly or indirectly affected… Let’s look out for one another and offer kindness.”

In an attempt to move with technological advances, the Carnegie Mellon University Libraries are modernizing many of their systems to meet what they see as changing student needs in a digital age.
In a statement to The Tartan, Alicia Salaz, associate dean of research and academic services, said, “we are responding primarily to student needs in shifting away from collection storage and towards more service-enabled space across the Libraries’ footprint, such as more individual and group study space, classroom and meeting space, for instance.”
One of the ways that the library system is changing is in moving away from physical collections. The effects of this can be seen in recent renovations of Hunt Library and Sorrells Library, both of which have increased study space in the library by removing some of the on-site, physical text collections.
Hunt Library has added classrooms on the first floor that are most often used for Integrative Design, Arts, and Technology (IDeATe) classes, and Sorrells Library has added a number of study spaces and rooms that can be requested for use. Salaz wrote, “even so [with the renovations], we often find during the semester that demand outpaces supply — and the amount of learning and study space we afford our students continues to lag [behind] our peers.”
As study spaces are added, books may need to be  removed to create room. Salaz wrote, “we would like to continue optimizing our campus-based print collections towards those that are in current use and meet users’ preferences for print — (there are uses and disciplines where print remains a superior option) — and where it makes sense, to reallocate prime campus space away from less-needed physical storage towards students’ other intellectual and academic needs.”
To reduce some physical demands, the Library System is focused on acquiring content that comes in a digital form, such as e-books. According to Salaz, digitizing current print holdings is not a priority, but their digitization lab at off-site storage on Penn Ave. digitizes Carnegie Mellon-created archival materials.
In conjunction with these changes, Carnegie Mellon signed a deal with Elsevier, a publishing company, that will give Carnegie Mellon researchers the option to publish open access papers. Additionally, Carnegie Mellon reached an agreement with the Association for Computing Machinery to prioritize open access material by publishing content from magazines and conference proceedings at no cost to authors.
Another innovation being discussed in the libraries is the possibility of removing fines for borrowed items that are returned late. The issues in question revolve around which materials should retain fines for late returns, like multimedia equipment, which can have late fees of $25 a day or more. Salaz writes, “we’re evaluating how the removal of fines and charges would impact different sets of users of different collections. For example, should we eliminate fines on all types of material, or keep them for high-demand items like multimedia equipment? Should we eliminate all charges, or just late fines?”
As the demand for student work spaces and expanded digital offerings increases, and the demand for physical print material decreases, Carnegie Mellon’s libraries are sure to change in the coming years. But while the library continues their modernization efforts, Salaz states that they  will “respond to users, rather than pushing them in a particular direction.”

I’ll take “Cool Things that We Learned About Last Monday” for $2,000, Alex.
This Carnegie Mellon senior in civil and environmental engineering is competing in the upcoming Jeopardy! college tournament.
Who is Emma Farrell, who might be better known to some on campus for her work as a Head Orientation Counselor and General Manager at WRCT?
Correct! Farrell will compete for a $100,000 prize and a spot in the Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions against 14 other college students.
Though Farrell is the only Pennsylvanian to be competing in this college tournament, hailing originally from Telford, PA, Penn State senior Kylie Weaver has also been selected to compete.
Farrell is not the first Carnegie Mellon student to compete on the show. Last Nov., Carnegie Mellon alum Lindsey Schultz appeared on the Tournament of Champions after winning $103,002 over four episodes in March. Schultz was in the Science and Humanities Scholar program, majoring in biological sciences and ethics, history, and public policy. Schultz, who is from Connellsville, PA, made it to the semifinals in the Tournament of Champions, a competition which also included Jeopardy! record setter James Holzhauer.
Farrell has a similar multidisciplinary focus here at Carnegie Mellon, pairing her studies in civil and environmental engineering with history. This could serve to boost her chances in a wider variety of categories.
In 2004, Carnegie Mellon electrical and computer engineering junior Kermin Fleming won the $100,000 first place prize in the College Championship. In a classic 2004 Carnegie Mellon student move, Fleming made a bet of $1337 in his first episode, telling the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette  that he was referencing the online slang “leet.” Fleming completed his masters at Carnegie Mellon, and then went on to do his Ph.D. at MIT.
Scott Weiss, who graduated as a member of Carnegie Mellon’s first undergraduate computer science class in 1992, made Jeopardy! history in 2007 when he ended his third game in a perfect tie for first place at $16,000. All contestants competed in a tie-breaking game, which Weiss lost in the final round.
IBM’s Watson became another Carnegie Mellon-affiliated Jeopardy! contestant. In 2011, the computer, developed at IBM with the help of Carnegie Mellon faculty and students, bested Jeopardy! legends Ken Jennings, who has the record for most consecutive wins, and Brad Rutter, who has won the most money in the show.
Watson then came to campus to compete in a Jeopardy!-like competition against Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh students. Watson ended with a final score of $52,100, to the Pitt team’s $12,937 and the Carnegie Mellon team’s $7,463.
Farrell’s Jeopardy! run will capture campus attention yet again when it airs April 6 to 17.

You’ve seen Pittsburgh’s busses; the big, (usually) red bricks barreling down the streets, the route number glowing in amber, usually on time and only sometimes packed. With seating for 36 in the smaller busses and 63 in the larger, articulated models, each bus can replace dozens of toxic emissions-spewing cars. The Tartan staff can personally vouch for the efficacy of the Pittsburgh bus network, which takes us to campus, back home, and to any of the fascinating and unique neighborhoods in this diverse, storied city. For most Carnegie Mellon ID card holders, taking the bus anywhere in the network is as easy as tapping the emblem of university affiliation on the ConnectCard reader at the entrance, a little bloop, and then you’re on your way, at no extra cost. The same applies to most of the other universities in the city, with the University of Pittsburgh and Chatham University also offering free public transit with student IDs. No stress, no worries, no carrying around cash or reloading a ConnectCard. For non-students in Pittsburgh, however, the situation is less rosy. A single ride costs $2.75 (exact change only), and even if you invest in a ConnectCard, you’re still looking at $2.50 per bus ride. Weekly and monthly passes cost $25.00 and $97.50 respectively, with an annual pass coming in at a whopping $1,072.50. This is still cheaper than a car, but splashing out a grand to ride the sometimes-inconsistent bus for a year is a bitter pill for working people. Not only do Pittsburgh workers have to endure stagnant wages and potentially vindictive bosses, but also the extra little knife twist of paying for the privilege of getting to work. 
There’s a simple solution to this injustice that would be a great way to increase ridership, reduce traffic, and help Pittsburgh meet the UN sustainability goals: make public transit free — for everyone. It's neither a radical idea, nor a  new idea, nor a difficult idea to implement. About 100 cities in the world have free public transportation, including Dunkirk, France; Tallin, Estonia; and as of Dec. 2019, Kansas City, KS. Ridership hasn’t increased universally, but cities that have implemented free public transit have seen improvements from 3-85 percent increased ridership. With ridership in Pittsburgh already increasing, (bucking national trends), removing cost barriers to public transportation could lead even more residents to leave their cars in the driveway.
In addition to just making it cheaper to move around the city, fare-free public transit would signal a shift in the way Pittsburgh treats its poorest residents. According to the 2019 Port Authority factbook, over 40 percent of Allegheny County riders have annual household incomes below $35,000. The daily cost of rides is an implicit tax on lower-income Pittsburgh residents, the people least able to bear a cost to simply move around. A move to fare-free public transit would force the city to invest in the public transit network, and away from deadly and wasteful automobiles. Cars kill pedestrians, clog up the streets, and shred the fabric of public space, atomizing and alienating residents from each other. Cities should be designed around the public; the people traveling from place to place, going to work, to visit parks, to meet with friends, to attend events. Fare-free transit wouldn’t change everything, but it would be the first step in making Pittsburgh a city for everyone, not just the ones with cash.

Carnegie Mellon University has consistently established itself as a top proponent of revitalizing Pittsburgh. A detailed 2017 report argues that hundreds of Carnegie Mellon startup companies provide for the greater Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania region. The report also boasts that the university produces $2.7 billion in annual economic impact for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. With its innovative research and projects, Carnegie Mellon helps communities locally and globally.
However, Carnegie Mellon's “innovations” come at a cost. Many Pittsburgh residents are harmed by university systems, policies, and research that are often passed off as being helpful toward the community. 
Just last week on the private Facebook page Overlooked at Carnegie Mellon, members of our community revealed the institution’s blatant erasure of predominantly black neighborhoods in Pittsburgh through maps on our website and in the Cohon Center. Although the university apologized and claimed this was an unintentional mistake, many share the sentiment expressed last week by The Tartan junior staffwriter Liam O'Connell: it was purposeful enforcement of “a legacy of racial and economic discrimination in the city of Pittsburgh.”
Carnegie Mellon’s pattern of anti-blackness is not new. In 2018, Heinz adjunct professor and KDKA-TV columnist Jonathan Delano tweeted against protestors seeking justice for Antwon Rose II, writing that they were solely “blocking traffic.” Despite efforts to remove Delano from Heinz faculty for his irresponsible and racist stances, there was no statement or action from the university.
The university directly affects Pittsburghers without their knowledge through its research projects. One example is the predictive policing project by Carnegie Mellon researchers and the Metro21 Institute, which has been piloted in Homewood since 2016. It applies machine learning to historic crime data to send additional Pittsburgh police patrols to regions deemed as “hotspots” for crime. A modern continuation of broken-windows style policing, this project has been met with significant concern on the impact on criminalization and arrests in minority neighborhoods, which the researchers are not exploring. Algorithmic policing such as this has the potential to enforce biases in an already broken policing system, rather than change or remove them.  
This partnership between the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and Carnegie Mellon is part of another systematic pattern perpetuated by the institution: using the community as a testbed for technology research. 
Carnegie Mellon has continued straining its relationship with Pittsburgh by pushing for autonomous vehicles. There has consistently been backlash against autonomous test driving, specifically the autonomous shuttle experimentation in the Mon-Oakland Mobility Project. Despite years of multiple protests and rallies, the university and the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure support this $23 million futuristic mobility program. The Mon-Oakland project emphasizes the concept of “new mobility,” which originally included the development of autonomous shuttles. Eventually, community pushback took the self-driving shuttles off the table, but the overall project remains in progress. 
There's very little, if any, communication between proponents of the Mon-Oakland project and community members. Residents in these communities do not believe their problems are addressed with trendy high-tech shuttles that cost us $14 to $17 million. On the other hand, Mon-Oakland proponents and Mayor Bill Peduto have been wanting this project to happen for years.
As Carnegie Mellon continues to expand throughout the city, erecting new buildings and oppressing residents in the place they call home, we must begin to make amends. If our institution can afford all these initiatives, they can definitely afford to pay up in other ways.
This is easier said than done. Like many public and private institutions, Carnegie Mellon is a corporate, non-profit, educational institution that has been granted tax-exempt status. Even though Carnegie Mellon occupies 153 acres of Pittsburgh land, we do not pay the city for the plentiful resources we use to maintain our institution.
And Carnegie Mellon has many resources to use. While Carnegie Mellon’s endowment is relatively small compared to larger and more established universities, our endowment is growing at a rapid rate. According to the 2016 annual financial report, Carnegie Mellon's operating budget "has increased by an average of 4.1% annually for the past decade".  In 2018, the institution received $81 million in contributions for land, buildings, and equipment. Now, with our new Make Possible initiative, we plan to attain another $1 billion by the target completion date of June 2024. 
Furthermore, the institution launched a $27.5 million research initiative with the CONIX Research Center to expand “novel architectures for large-scale distributed computing systems." This seems innocent without considering the funds come from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a federal agency that is leading the development of drone warfare. 
Even in the fiscal year 2017, the university spent $172 million in direct funding from the Department of Defense for research focused on the potential of artificial intelligence to transform drone warfare. Carnegie Mellon has been confirmed to be involved with Project Maven, an initiative headed by the Pentagon to develop and integrate algorithms into warfighting systems. With federal money, Carnegie Mellon is creating weapons and technology with the goal of maintaining endless wars abroad, which do nothing but hurt people globally. 
The toxic, one-way relationship Carnegie Mellon established with Pittsburgh and the world is clearly detrimental. Then on top of that, the institution continues to suck money from its students in exchange for research with questionable ethics being conducted behind closed doors. We must at least begin efforts to give back to the Pittsburgh community.
Property taxes or payment in lieu of taxes (PILOTs) are not the ideal method of contributing to the city of Pittsburgh, but they are certainly a start, especially as institutions like our own and the University of Pittsburgh continue to grow exponentially. These payments, which can range anywhere between $5 to $10 million annually, are at least better than our half-baked, if not outright harmful, attempts to engage with Pittsburgh communities.
In 2008, a Craig Street business owner expressed their fear to Pittsburgh City Paper about Carnegie Mellon’s expansion into the Oakland area: “We are competing with CMU… Once they control everything, they will determine who they want and who they don't want.” Over a decade later, this concern remains relevant. Carnegie Mellon University, with its tentacles suffocating the Pittsburgh community and our very own students, must change its ways and amend damage that has been already done.

I’m writing to address Carnegie Mellon University’s use of a racially offensive map that violates the values of our university. I am deeply saddened and embarrassed. Simply put, it should have never been created, let alone used for years. I apologize for the hurt it caused those in our community, on and off campus. 
I was impressed by Liam O’Connell’s opinion piece in the Tartan last week that highlighted the history and vibrancy of the communities that were left off our map. He rightly pointed out that if we improve our diversity and inclusivity efforts, we can have a positive influence on each other, Carnegie Mellon and the communities that surround our campus. These sentiments are at the heart of the conversations I have been having with our community since I became provost. 
We have members of our community who call these neighborhoods home. And many of our students, faculty, and staff are already deeply engaged in these neighborhoods through community-driven research, service and other activities. As a university, we know we must and will do more to connect with neighbors from every neighborhood in our surrounding community.
Making real progress is extremely important to me. This past year, I asked each academic dean to develop comprehensive diversity, equity, and inclusion plans. We recently requested that each administrative unit do the same. The strategies and, most importantly, the actions that will result from them are vital to Carnegie Mellon making forward progress. This past Nov., we made a commitment to hire a vice provost and chief diversity officer, and I expect this leader and a well-resourced office to be established by the fall semester.
Striving toward diversity, equity, and inclusion is essential to Carnegie Mellon’s mission. It improves our ability to produce great research, generate knowledge, and educate students who make a difference to society. To be a more welcoming and inclusive community, everyone must have a place at the table and we must be willing to engage each other fully, listen to, and learn from each other.  And then, together we must make change.
Our journey towards this goal is a long one and we will certainly fall along the way, as we did in this case. I know this community is committed to getting there.
Jim Garrett, Jr. is the current Provost of Carnegie Mellon University.

Following the logistical disaster that was election night of the Iowa caucuses, 62 percent of the results finally came in the following day at 4:15 p.m. The most common narrative to emerge was that Pete Buttigieg was leading in Iowa. This was based on a 1.8 percent lead in state delegate equivalents (SDEs), which serve as proxies for pledged delegates that go to the Democratic National Committee. Because each caucus precinct is allocated a set number of SDEs, there can be an imbalance between the number of votes a candidate receives and their SDE count. 
When these initial results were released, Bernie Sanders led Pete Buttigieg in the popular vote in the first round and after voters realigned to viable candidates. However, news outlets overwhelmingly reported Buttigieg as the victor of Iowa. In their primary forecast model, FiveThirtyEight initially gave Buttigieg 85 percent of the credit for winning Iowa because of this.
By that Friday, results had been released for every caucus site, still placing Sanders ahead of Buttigieg in both vote counts and narrowing Buttigieg’s state delegate lead to less than 0.1 percent. What’s more, irregularities with precinct tallies, led DNC chair Tom Perez to call for a complete recanvass of the caucus results and the Associated Press announcing that it would not declare a winner.
But the narrative had been set. Buttigieg won and would reap the fruits of being first in the most influential state in the primaries. Tracking polls for New Hampshire from Suffolk University and Emerson College had him gaining 10 and 12 points respectively over three days since the caucuses. FiveThirtyEight’s polling model for the state has him up from 13.1 percent on Monday to 18.9 percent on Friday. That’s not to say a recanvass would show that Buttigieg wasn’t the winner, but news media set the narrative that he won despite not knowing the final results and heavily emphasizing the least democratic metric of the Iowa Democratic Caucuses.
The behavior that news outlets are showing isn’t the product of individual journalists’ choices, but rather, it is a result of how corporate media as an institution is structured. Coverage of the Iowa results is just representative of an ongoing pattern that they’ve shown throughout the Democratic primaries. While he was running, Cory Booker often received one of the highest shares of media coverage despite hovering between one and three percent in support throughout his run. In the weeks following the Dec. debate, election pundits often talked of a “Klobucharge"; post-New Year’s polling revealed this had never materialized. 
The night before the Jan. Democratic Debate, CNN published a story on a private meeting between Warren and Sanders in 2018 in which Sanders allegedly told Warren he thought a woman couldn’t win. A debate moderator from CNN asked Sanders “why he said that”. After denying that he did, the moderator followed up by asking Warren what she thought when Sanders told her “a woman could not win the election”. During that same debate, another moderator asked Sanders about his vote against the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. She then asked Warren, who voted for the deal, “why was Senator Sanders wrong?”. Former Senate and Democratic Presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke’s political future lived and died by the news media’s desire to give him oxygen. Consistently, outlets have been motivated to construct attention-grabbing narratives full of twists and plot development that will keep audiences “informed”.
The institutional framework of media to react immediately, sensationalize, and endlessly construct narratives wasn’t always this way. In the 1960s, there were three television networks for Americans to get their news from, while today’s highly competitive media market has an overwhelming number of choices. Each kept regular schedules with one hour of news reporting each night, rather than the 24/7 news cycle with a toddler’s attention span. Outlets largely veered away from alienating any demographics, rather than sensationalizing news to hold the attention of specific groups. 
In his book Why We’re Polarized, Vox Editor-In-Chief Ezra Klein writes, “the news is supposed to be a mirror held up to the world, but the world is far too vast to fit in our mirror. The fundamental thing the media does all day, every day, is decide what to cover — decide, that is, what is newsworthy.” The chaos and confusion that people experienced on the first election in the Democratic primary were worth reporting on. It would be good for people to understand what happened to make light of it. But not waiting longer to cover the results once we knew their accuracy and completeness signifies a failure in the media institution. Media outlets should have waited to make the results the main part of their stories, or at least severely hedged their reporting, but our news outlets are incentivized to get us “breaking news” fast. 
It’s woefully easy to criticize news media, but solutions to bad reporting won’t come from finger-wagging and Twitter ratios. We need to reform the institution of media itself, not turn to nihilistic hatred of the press as though what we have now is inevitable. This doesn’t mean going back to the way things were before cable news and social media; that is, having three networks to inform Americans presented its own issues. 
There is always the opportunity to seek out better ways to organize our institutions. With media in arguably the most important position to shape our elections, while simultaneously facing growing public distrust and loss of faith, we might be reaching a critical tipping point for realizing those reforms.
