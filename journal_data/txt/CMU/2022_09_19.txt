Viktoria Plzen vs. Inter Milan
Underdogs Viktoria Plzen was outmatched once again on Matchday 2. Recording only eight shots on Inter Milan’s 19 and just one shot on target versus Inter’s eight, it comes as no surprise that this match was firmly in the hands of the Italian side. The first goal came in the 20th minute, when Joaquin Correa passed to Edin Džeko on the edge of the box, who then placed a well-aimed shot into the side of the Viktoria Plzen net. An Inter counterattack in the 70th minute then saw Džeko make a run down the pitch before passing the ball to an unmarked Denzel Dumfries, who coolly converted to make the scoreline 2-0 to the visitors. Although Inter took all three points, they remain third in the Group C table, behind both Bayern and Barcelona, while Viktoria Plzen continue to sit in rock bottom.
Sporting vs. Tottenham
In the first major upset of Matchday 2, Sporting came out on top of English giants Tottenham. Despite the odds being against them, Sporting performed superbly, dominating possession, matching Tottenham’s shots, and recording one more shot on target than the visitors. It looked like the English side would hold the hosts to a 0-0 until the 90th minute, when Paulinho got onto the end of a corner swiftly taken by Pedro Gonçalves and flicked it past Hugo Lloris. Then, three minutes into stoppage time, Arthur Gomes made a phenomenal run into the box to slot the ball home, doubling the Portuguese side’s lead to 2-0. With this victory, Sporting retains their position at the top of Group A, while Spurs remain second in the table, ahead of Eintracht Frankfurt.
Liverpool vs. Ajax
Although the final scoreline has the teams seeming relatively well-matched, the statistics show a much greater disparity. Whereas Liverpool recorded 24 shots with 10 on target, Ajax recorded a total of three shots, only one of which was on target. The hosts opened the scoring when a long ball from Alisson Becker was passed to Mohamed Salah, who drilled it home past Remko Pasveer. The visitors fired back, however. In the 27th minute, after a lovely bit of back and forth inside the box, Mohammed Kudus deflected a shot off the corner of the woodwork and into the back of the Liverpool net, equalizing for the visitors. Despite numerous subsequent Liverpool chances, the Reds failed to capitalize and it seemed like the Dutch side may be able to hold the hosts to a draw. But then, in the 89th minute, Konstantinos Tsimikas’s corner found Joël Matip, who headed it home to bring the home side up 2-1. Liverpool now sit second in the Group A table under Napoli while Ajax falls to third, still ahead of Rangers.
Bayern Munich vs. Barcelona
Although both teams put forward strong performances, rivaling each other in possession, shots taken, and shots on target statistics, Bayern was the team with the better defense. The hosts opened the scoring in the 50th minute when Lucas Hernandez got on the end of Joshua Kimmich’s corner, heading the ball past Marc-André ter Stegen to put the German side up 1-0. Bayern doubled their lead just four minutes later, with Leroy Sané making a run into the box and bringing the hosts up 2-0 with a clinical finish. Despite Barcelona’s attempts to come back, Manuel Neuer stood firm, shutting the visitors out. Bayern now sits at the top of the Group C table, while Barça slips to second, staying ahead of Inter Milan and Viktoria Plzen.
Porto vs. Club Brugge
In another major upset, Portuguese giants Porto fell to Club Brugge in a 4-0 thrashing. The head-to-head began unfavorably for the home side when João Mário brought down Ferran Jutglà inside the box, giving away a penalty which Jutglà coolly converted. The hosts managed to hold the visitors at bay for the rest of the first half, but Club Brugge doubled their leads just one minute into the second half when a scramble at the edge of the box let the ball fall to Kamal Sowah, who promptly made it 2-0 to the Belgian side. Club Brugge pulled even further ahead in the 52nd minute, when a long, low cross by Bjorn Meijer found Andreas Skov Olsen, who slotted the ball home to make it 3-0. Finally, in the 89th minute, Antonio Nusa got behind his defender to receive a pass from Casper Nielsen before beating Diogo Costa in the ensuing one-on-one, making it 4-0 to Club Brugge. Club Brugge now sits at the top of Group B, just ahead of Bayer Leverkusen. Porto, however, slipped to the bottom of the table.
Marseille vs. Eintracht Frankfurt
Although Marseille recorded better possession rates, Eintracht Frankfurt’s shot statistics were superior, and this was reflected in the final scoreline. The only goal of the match came in the 43rd minute, when Randal Kolo Muani’s pass deflected off of Jordan Veretout to find an open Jesper Lindstrøm. Lindstrøm took it in stride and ushered his shot past Pau López into the bottom corner of the home side’s net. With this victory, Frankfurt climb to third in the Group D table while Marseille fall to the bottom of the group.
Bayer Leverkusen vs. Atlético Madrid
In yet another significant upset, German contenders Bayer Leverkusen scored twice against the visitors while shutting them out completely. Like the match between Sporting and Tottenham, despite numerous chances for both sides, neither capitalized for the majority of the game and it seemed like it would be inevitable for both teams to share the points. However, Leverkusen opened the scoring in the 84th minute when Jeremie Frimpong found an unmarked Robert Andrich at the edge of the box, who slotted the ball past Ivo Grbic to put the hosts up 1-0. Three minutes later, Leverkusen found themselves on a counterattack and Moussa Diaby, having broken free of his defender, converted to double the hosts’ lead. Leverkusen now sit second in the Group B table, just under Club Brugge, while Atleti falls to third, still keeping ahead of Porto.
Shakhtar Donetsk vs. Celtic
The match between Shakhtar Donetsk and Celtic started favorably for the visitors when a clearance-turned-counterattack in the 10th minute saw Reo Hatate’s cross deflect off Artem Bondarenko into the back of the Shakhtar net. Shakhtar made up for their mistake in the 29th minute, however, when Mykhaylo Mudryk sprinted away from his defender to receive a pass from Heorhiy Sudakov and fired the ball into the top of the Celtic net to equalize for the hosts. Despite Celtic creating a myriad of chances for themselves, they failed to capitalize any further, resulting in the match ending 1-1. Shakhtar now sit second in the Group F table, under Real Madrid, while Celtic sit in third, just above Leipzig.
A.C. Milan vs. Dinamo Zagreb
The match between A.C. Milan and Dinamo Zagreb went as the statistics would suggest. The Croatian side was outmatched in every area and fell behind in the 45th minute when Boško Šutalo brought down Rafael Leão inside the box and Olivier Giroud calmly converted the ensuing penalty. The visitors conceded again just after halftime in the 47th minute when Leão crossed the ball to Alexis Saelemaekers, who headed it high, beyond the reach of Dominik Livakovic and into the back of the net. Dinamo pulled one back in the 56th minute, with Bruno Petkovic utilizing some fancy footwork to fend off four defenders before passing the ball to Mislav Oršic, who slotted it past two defenders and Mike Maignan to make it 2-1. There was to be no comeback, however, and Milan sealed their win in the 77th minute when Theo Hernández’s pass found Tommaso Pobega inside the box, who fired the ball into the top of the Dinamo net to make the score 3-1. Milan climbs to the top of Group E while Dinamo falls to second in the table, ahead of Salzburg and Chelsea.
Rangers vs. Napoli
Yet again, the Rangers were thoroughly outmatched. Recording just 10 shots to Napoli’s 25, of those, three being on target in comparison to Napoli’s 10. Still, the Scottish side held out for the majority of the game before conceding in the 68th minute, when Matteo Politano converted a penalty following a handball call. Then, in the 85th minute, Giacomo Raspadori made it 2-0 to the visitors following some back and forth in the box. Six minutes later, in the first minute of stoppage time, André-Frank Zambo Anguissa made a beautiful run before passing the ball to Tanguy Ndombele, who drilled it home to make it 3-0 for the Italian side. Napoli now sit at the top of Group A, ahead of Liverpool, while Rangers remain rock bottom below Ajax.
Chelsea vs. Salzburg
Although both teams earned a point from the match, the result was, undoubtedly, at least a little disappointing for the hosts. Despite recording 13 more shots than the Austrian visitors, the English side failed to convert consistently. The scoring opened in the 48th minute when James Mount’s cross went past Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and found Raheem Sterling, who curled his shot into the back of the net to make it 1-0 to the home side. Salzburg struck back in the 75th minute, however, when Junior Adamu’s cross found Noah Okafor, who converted to draw the visitors level. In sharing the points, both teams ended up remaining in their positions from last week, with Salzburg third and Chelsea fourth in the Group E table, below A.C. Milan and Dinamo Zagreb.
Real Madrid vs. Leipzig
Coming into this match with the odds against them, Leipzig held their own for the majority of the game, managing similar statistics to Real Madrid. In the 80th minute, however, Federico Valverde got on the end of a long cross by Vinícius Júnior, then fired the ball home to make it 1-0 to the home side. Then, in the first minute of stoppage time, a set piece just outside the box taken by Toni Kroos found Marco Asensio, whose first touch sent the ball past Péter Gulácsi to double the home side’s lead. With this win, Real sits on the top of the Group F table, ahead of Shakhtar Donetsk, while Leipzig fell to the bottom of the group, under Celtic.
Copenhagen vs. Sevilla
The head-to-head between Copenhagen and Sevilla was the only goalless match of Matchday 2. Despite this, there were opportunities on both sides. Sevilla recorded 63% possession to Copenhagen’s 37% and 11 shots to Copenhagen’s seven. Both teams managed two shots on target, but neither was able to capitalize. Sharing the points, both teams retained their table positions from last week, with Copenhagen third and Sevilla fourth in the Group G table, under Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund.
Juventus vs. Benfica
In the final upset of Matchday 2, the Old Lady dropped points to her Portuguese visitors despite taking an early lead. Ironically, the match could not have started better for the home side, who put themselves on the score sheet just four minutes in thanks to a free kick by Arkadiusz Milik. However, it seemed like the Old Lady fell asleep for the majority of the rest of the match, and Benfica took advantage. The equalizer came in the 43rd minute, when João Mário converted a penalty following a foul inside the box. Then, in the 55th minute, Rafa Silva’s effort was punched away by Mattia Perin, but fell to David Neres, who drilled the ball into the bottom corner of the net, making the scoreline 2-1 in Benfica’s favor. Benfica sit second in the Group H table, just under PSG, as Juventus remain third.
Maccabi Haifa vs. PSG
In terms of statistics, Maccabi Haifa performed remarkably well against PSG. In terms of the scoreline, however, there is no question that the hosts were outmatched. The Israeli side opened the scoring in the 24th minute when Dolev Haziza made an absolutely fantastic cross to Tjaronn Chery, whose clinical finish put the hosts up 1-0. PSG equalized in the 37th minute, however, when some back and forth between Kylian Mbappé and Lionel Messi saw the latter convert for the visitors. Messi then sent Mbappé a through ball in the 69th minute, which Mbappé fired past Josh Cohen, allowing the French side to pull ahead. Then, a long pass down the pitch by Marco Verratti in the 88th minute found Neymar, who made it 3-1 for PSG. With all three points in hand, PSG now sits at the top of Group H, while Maccabi Haifa remains at the bottom of the table.
Manchester City vs. Borussia Dortmund
The match between Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund boasted some of the best goals of Matchday 2. Though they were had very limited opportunities, the visitors opened the scoring in the 56th minute when Jude Bellingham got on the end of a powerful strike by Marco Reus, heading the ball past Ederson to make it 1-0 to Dortmund. The equalizer came in the 80th minute, with John Stones firing an absolute bullet from outside the 18-yard box into the back of the net. City then pulled ahead in the 84th minute with Erling Haaland scoring an impressive acrobatic goal off of João Cancelo’s cross. Both teams retained their table positions from Matchday 1, with City firmly atop the Group G table and Dortmund in second, above Copenhagen and Sevilla.

Football
This past Saturday, the #20 DIII-ranked Tartans took on the Grove City Wolverines at home in a high-scoring game. The Tartans were ranked 20th following their week two game against RPI; this is the highest ranking the Tartans have received in program history, according to D3football.com. Carnegie Mellon is one of three teams that were previously unranked to make it into the top 25 this past week.

The Wolverines wouldn’t let up and responded with another touchdown of their own but missed the point after, making it 30-26.
As the clock ran down, the Tartans got another touchdown, widening the lead to 37-26. Following Grove City’s fourth turnover of the day, the Tartans were once again able to make a field goal, 40-26. In a last effort, Grove City managed to score one last touchdown, but it was too late, leaving only two seconds on the clock and the scoreboard reading 40-33 in favor of the Tartans.

Buggy is a Carnegie Mellon tradition which has existed since 1920. The sport, which is practiced throughout the academic year, culminates in an annual series of relay races held on each year’s Raceday during Spring Carnival, in which teams vy for the title of “Champion.” The Buggy Rolls Report column reports on the buggies and roll counts for all of the teams which attend the freeroll practices (“rolls”) each weekend organized by the Carnegie Mellon Sweepstakes Committee. All of the information reported in the column is provided by the Carnegie Mellon Sweepstakes Committee.
Last weekend marked the first days of rolls for Carnegie Mellon buggy teams. The weather remained clear for both Saturday and Sunday, and the teams who made it out to rolls were able to take full advantage.

'Ooblets:' Indie dance-battle farming RPG
Rating: 3.5/5
"Ooblets," a cute indie game, was released in full after receiving its golden status. This game is centered around helping users' new neighbors with jobs and tasks and having small creatures compete in dance battles. Essentially it feels like a cute, quirky combination of monster-collecting RPGs like "Pokémon" and farming games like "Stardew Valley." 
Interestingly, at the beginning of the game, the player finds themselves alone and in a new town surrounded by these unique creatures called "ooblets." Then they will meet the island's mayor, who gives you housing and rewards in exchange for services for the town and its people. In this house, the players are given the essentials: a bed, cooking range, storage, a twig, and rock-infested land to grow crops and raise and grow your ooblet family. Later on in the game, the players are able to do dance battles for rewards. 
I found myself enamored and drawn in by collecting all variations of the ooblets and helping Mayor Tinstle and her town. Though the main selling point of this game is to collect the Pokémon-esque creatures called ooblets, by competing in dance battles with your desired ooblets, I have to say, I find the dance battles unchallenging, to say the least. This made me less motivated to finish some of the quests that require me to complete multiple bouts in a row. But the non-violence and wholesome style of turn-based combat is very unusual nowadays in the gaming world. 
There is another feature in the game in which players can plant the ooblet seeds they win from the dance battles on their farms. In order for the crops to grow, the player needs to design a decent concocting system to take care of the crops. I would say once I realized that the quests become repetitive, I lost a bit of interest. Overall, I would give this game a 3.5/5. While I enjoyed its relaxing tone and cute style, as I got used to the game, I couldn't help feeling a lack of excitement.
'Cult of the Lamb:' Journey to gain worshippers and defeat the crowns
Rating: 4/5
"The Cult of the Lamb" is a roguelike game comparable to the likes of "The Binding of Isaac" in terms of gameplay style and gore. On the surface, this game can be seen as a cute lamb game like "Animal Crossing," but as soon as you load up the game, you are met with murderous religious cults, the occult, and sacrifice. The game starts out as you are walking to be sacrificed, or one can say executed, due to being a possible vessel of the Red Crown, the enemy of the other four crowns. However, after your supposed death, you are met by the imprisoned Red Crown and are given life and his power in exchange for enacting his will to kill the other crowns and release him from their prison. You are then met with the challenge of creating your own cult and making it successful to raise your power as a prophet of the Red Crown. 
There is no one way to raise your power. In general, you are to recruit up to 20 followers and indoctrinate them until you unlock the highest skills and doctrines. These skills take the form of weapons and curses to use on your crusades in pursuit of defeating the crowns and collecting resources. Some may send out followers to collect faith and resources for the cult, others may avoid that completely and just farm and choose to make everyone feel equal and valued and loved.
As I played the game I realized that I was less interested in the conflict of the story and the crusades but instead in the cult management aspect of the game. I found myself choosing doctrines that healed and helped my followers instead of having them ruled by an iron fist. Due to that, I found most of my followers dying of old age. So many died that I had to harvest their meat at night! Overall, I rank this game a 4/5 thanks to its cute characters, fun plot, farming features, and the resource management side of the game.

‘Splatoon 3’ records massive sales in Japan
The newest entry in Nintendo’s third-person shooter franchise, “Splatoon 3” recorded a massive 3.45 million units sold in Japan after only three days of sales — this number includes both physical and digital sales. This set the domestic record for most video games units sold in the first three days in Japan. Other reports reveal 13.3 million units have been sold worldwide. Following the announcement, Nintendo stock share jumped five percent. 
Launching on Sept. 9, “Splatoon 3” was anticipated to be one of Nintendo’s top-selling games of the year. Comparing the number of units sold in the first three days in Japan to other franchises, “Animal Crossing: New Horizons” was the previous record holder at 2.68 million units sold, “Pokémon Black/White” right behind at 2.64 million units, and “Final Fantasy VIII” right behind at 2.54 million units.
New ‘Legend of Zelda’ game receives trailer, name
During the Nintendo Direct on Sept. 13, Nintendo revealed the title of the newest entry in one of its longest franchises: “The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.” New footage of the game accompanied the title reveal as well. The game is set to launch May 12, 2023. 
“Tears of the Kingdom” is the sequel to “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,” which launched alongside the Nintendo Switch. Based on the trailers of the game so far, “Tears of the Kingdom” appears to be a true successor to “Breath of the Wild” that also contains heavy inspiration from “The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword,” especially given the scene where Link, the protagonist of the series, jumps from an island floating in the sky.
Though there was some initial confusion around whether “tears” was pronounced like the ripping action or like crying, Nintendo has confirmed it is like crying.
Next game in former ‘Yakuza’ series revealed
“Like a Dragon: Inshin!” was revealed during the PlayStation State of Play on Sept. 13. The game is the next entry in the series formerly known as “Yakuza,” which will be known as “Like a Dragon” going forward. 
Launching Feb. 21, 2023, “Inshin” is described as “set uniquely in 1860s Kyo, a fictionalized version of Kyoto,” that will feature “familiar faces to tell this epic historical tale.” The game will include Kazuma Kiryu, a protagonist from other entries in the franchise. Notably, “Inshin” will not contain an English dub.
Alleged leaks of ‘Grand Theft Auto VI’ surface
On Sept. 18, a user by the name of “teapotuberhacker” uploaded what they claim to be clips from the upcoming game “Grand Theft Auto VI” (“GTAVI”) on an online forum for the franchise, GTAForums. Their message stated, “Hi, Here are 90 footage/clips from GTA 6. Its possible i could leak more data soon, GTA 5 and 6 source code and assets, GTA 6 testing build.”
While “GTAVI” was officially confirmed by Rockstar earlier this year, not much information has been released about the game. However, the footage that was uploaded appears to confirm a rumor that “GTAVI” will have a male and female protagonist and take place in Vice City, a location previously established in the franchise. 
‘God of War: Ragnarök’ gets story trailer

Once more into the breach, my Pillbox friends.
Fresh off an explosive first issue of the school year, we are back to the races with a Laid Back issue that celebrates all that makes us, us. The Muppet Corner takes it's first hiatus of the year, but everyone else has picked up the slack with content that will make you laugh, think, and feel. 
Starting on page 4 we have an exciting review of "Venom 2," by Alex Mathews, the ever-so-busy News section editor. Why "Venom 2," and why now? You'll just have to ask Alex at (INSERT PHONE NUMBER HERE).
Page 6 lets Cole Skuse tells us all about some of the most important recent events in the X-men comics. Seems mighty confusing, but I guess most of the fun comes from getting to know all about Madrox, and then telling everyone about Madrox.
Page 8 has the newest press release from William Curvan, all about the newest breakthrough that Carnegie Mellon students have done, this time in the field of mechanical engineering. The power of the encabulator has been explained, all for you to read.
Page 10 has some beautiful photos chronicling the dances done at the ARCC Mid-Autumn Festival, with the page layout being done by the same person who took the photos, the Tartan's own Jaehyun Lim.
Page 12 continues Anna Cappella's serial story telling extravaganza. Why are these letters from Maggie? Who is Cassandra? The newest "David Copperfield" is being created before your very eyes, don't miss it.
Curvan is back page 14, with a thoughtful review of the newest "Game of Thrones" spinoff, a show we've been told is surprisingly good!
Page 16 contains the work of another new contributor of ours, Alison Zheng. If you've ever wanted to learn about this one specific Operatic piece, then the article is for you. Otherwise, it still is for you, as you'll get to learn all about Rusalka the water nymph.
Page 18 drops some poetry bombs from the classic Bortner/Rossi dream team. Aren't we glad they are still here for us.
And of course, playlist on page 19.
Ciao,
Your own Pillbox Editors

Cassandra, 
It’s too bad that I didn’t get to see you this morning, which is most of the reason that I am writing to you right now. I also just like writing to you because it means you have to listen to me tell you random things that I think. We always used to debrief after nights out, and now there is always too much work or not enough sleep or time, and while that all makes sense, I still wanted to gush with you about seeing Henry and Wendy last night, preferably over an ungodly quantity of Schatz. 
Who would have thought that they even knew each other? I never would have expected it; even less would I have expected to even have seen Wendy at that party. It was a good party too, and I know you thought the music was good because they played a lot of Kanye. I really liked Henry, especially when he did that silly thing where he grabbed your hand and spun you around. He’s cuter than I remembered from the night I met him, and I’m glad you got to meet him. He asked for my snap; I think he’s going to become a character for us.
It just felt so good to be out with you and Monica again, just like we used to. Sometimes I just need to dance to “No Hands'' by Waka Flocka Flame for a couple of minutes after a week of working really hard and everything just sort of makes sense again.
We should definitely never go back to Insomnia Cookies ever again, though. Don’t get me wrong, it definitely was the right thing to eat at that time of night, but now that I know that Lou’s friends work there, I just never want to go back. Or maybe I want to go back every night, just to see if one day they might say something about him, give me even a little crumb to chew on about what’s happened or what’s happening. It’s ridiculous how he’s managed to ruin everything about this city, and he’s not even here. He’s crept into interactions with people that I was friends with first. It’s not fair. 
Cassandra, some things just make me ache. Almost everything here does, in a good way. All the places and people and songs are the same as they were last year, but now I remember things about them. I remember sitting at that table with Miles, or eating that particular sandwich with you and Monica and it all comes together and it makes me ache. I should probably make a new playlist. 
It’s wild though, how many people I see every day that I recognize, and yet I never see you or Monica, or even Miles for that matter. I’m just always seeing the same rotation of characters, people who I don’t even think take the same classes or are in the same program as I am. It makes me think that there has to be a reason for each of them, that they’re going to end up being significant later on. Maybe that’s why we saw Henry at the party — meeting him randomly twice in so many weeks seems purposeful. I just don’t believe in accidents, I guess. Or mistakes.
People here don’t make mistakes, did you know that? All those times when your professors tell you that the class average is anything lower than 100, it’s only because your score is the one bringing the class down. Either that, or it’s a lie. The next time you’re in recitation or something, test it. Make a silly mistake on an assignment. Admit it to the people around you. See what happens. 
Also, I probably should have started with this, but that thing happened again last night after we got back at, like, 3 a.m. I was going up the stairs to my floor, once again groggy as hell, and I saw Heron, Sasha’s neighbor who I met last week. He doesn’t live in Gardens, obviously, but I wasn’t gonna judge. I actually wasn’t gonna do anything at all, until I watched him scan himself into my suitemate’s room. My suitemate who’s a senior. It didn’t make any sense, Cass. That’s all.
Best,
    Maggie

With the trailer for Disney’s live action "The Little Mermaid" coming out recently, it was only fitting that the Pittsburgh Opera’s season opener was Rusalka, dubbed “Opera’s Own Little Mermaid.” However, contrary to the slogan, Rusalka’s origins trace back to early 20th century Czech Republic, when composer Antonín Dvořák based his libretto on Czech and Slavic folklore. Here, Rusalka is no mermaid, but a water nymph. She also loses her voice, but here it comes back in bouts of despair and anguish over a lost love.
For an opera performed by the Pittsburgh Opera cast for the first time in its 83-year history, I found that production took great care in defending the accuracy and cultural context of the show itself. Czech scholars and historians were called in to help, with Czech diplomats who came to watch receiving applause during the pre-show announcements. While the plot of Rusalka itself was quite straightforward, the awareness to the origins of the show was greatly appreciated from my standpoint as a historian. 
For the lonesome Rusalka, soprano Sara Gartland put on a stellar, although somewhat expected, performance. From my seats in the Director’s Circle, I could hear Gartland clearly enough, although certain low notes became lost within the orchestral accompaniment. While I wish I could have seen more of her versatility during the show, having only been spared love songs and longing the entire two hours and 40 minutes, I also believe that Rusalka’s lack of character development highly contributed to this factor. Rusalka’s outfit, however, is crafted beautifully. With a long, flowing gown that ripples as she moves, the colors reflect the depths of the sea — a light aquamarine slowly turning into a deep navy near the ends. The strands of fabric on her back are meant to mimic the dorsal fin of a fish, her sleeves meant to be the webbed fins. 
Rusalka’s father Vodnik, played by Hao Jiang Tian, entered the scene more as a comedic relief but quickly transformed into the hauntingly desperate laments of a worried father. As Hao’s voice bounded off the walls of the Benedum Center, you could hear the audience shift in their seats — almost made uneasy by the ghost-like sounds. Hao’s costuming, however, was the most disappointing part of the production. Perhaps the costume department spared no attention to the men of the show, but I found that Vodnik, as well as the Prince that Rusalka falls in love with, had the worst outfits of the entire production. Vodnik is dressed in what can only be described as a vomit-blue-grey cloth, while the Prince’s outfits seem more akin to B.F. Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly than a 19th century European aristocrat. 
Perhaps the best part of the opera, however, was Leah Hawkins in the role of the Foreign Princess. While her parts only appear during the second and shortest act, her entrance with the chilling line “No, this is not love / Ne, není to láska” strikes at the fantastical ideal of a “happily ever after.” She is cold, ruthless, but above all (as Rusalka laments), she is passionate. The Prince has almost no choice but to fall for her, and Hawkins perfects that sly cunning perfectly. Her notes reached all points of the theatre (a hard task given the somewhat overpowering acoustics of the orchestra), and her impact was plenty. Hawkins was what I wished the character of Rusalka’s aunt and wish-granting witch, Ježibaba, was given. Played by Marianne Cornetti, I found the initial introduction to her character lackluster — lacking much of the pomp and circumstance that someone “feared by nymphs and loved by humans” should possess. While Cornetti warmed up to the role as the third act began, I felt the initial gap even then. 
Despite my quarrels with the plot itself, Rusalka by the Pittsburgh Opera was enjoyable. With the rest of the season marked by both classics and newer generation shows, I encourage any curious music lover to buy a student ticket and check it out. 
Through September 17th, 2022, at the Pittsburgh Opera, Pittsburgh. “Rusalka” continues with further dates on the 20th, 23th, and 25th.

i bathe myself in sugar, scrape granules 
into raw skin which blushes harshly at 
my touch and i like to be sweet. when
people breathe me in i want to taste like
candy on their tongue — leave them licking
their lips wondering when i’ll be theirs. so
i’ll let my skin spew blood down the dingy
bathtub drain if it means i melt in their mouth

This past week, the Carnegie Mellon community welcomed a herd of thirteen goats and one donkey to campus from Allegheny GoatScape, a local nonprofit whose mission is to reduce unwanted and invasive vegetation in public spaces by using goats for browsing. Students and faculty watched the hill between the Purnell Center for the Arts and the Gates Hillman building fade from green and overgrown to a more managed brush. However, many people may be unaware of the impact these goats have on local sustainability.
Goats are an extremely effective and sustainable means to target invasive species in Pittsburgh. They are used as an alternative to gas-powered machinery and herbicides or pesticides harmful to the environment. Goats are advantageous compared to other agricultural animals because of their four-chambered stomach. When goats eat an invasive plant such as poison ivy or poison oak, their stomach also digests the seeds of the plant — unlike birds — meaning that the seeds are not then released in their waste. This means they do not further add to the spread of invasive plant species. Goats also have a split hoof, which makes them particularly equipped to navigate steep inclines characteristic of Pittsburgh terrain. While goats mainly eat the green leaves and shrubs, they do not target the roots of the invasive plants. Though they are a very effective tool for invasive plant species management, they do not kill the invasive plant, which means that it likely will return in the coming season. 
Invasive species, as defined by the USDA, are species not native to the environment and whose introduction causes or is likely to harm the economy, the environment, or human health. Invasive species — both plants and animals — can impede or destroy the growth of plants and animals in the local ecosystem, and particularly are a risk for endangered plants and animals. The goats in Pittsburgh target invasive species such as knotweed, poison ivy, and poison oak which threaten the growth of native plants in Pennsylvania. 
Hillary Steffes, the Chief Goat Herder for Allegheny GoatScape, is curious to understand the relationship between soil and invasive plants to create a long-term solution against their growth. Recently in Pittsburgh, randomized soil samples were collected from areas that were not sites for previous factories or situated on the riverfront, and it was found that Pittsburgh soil has a high level of trace metals in it and has been depleted of many of its nutrients, classifying the soil quality as poor. Invasive plant species tend to thrive in soil that has been more ‘disturbed,’ meaning the soil is lacking in nutrients. In Pittsburgh’s case, the lack of nutrients is a result of the post-industrial society. Steffe’s goal is to develop a more dynamic and collaborative approach which would include a soil assessment of the land the goats are browsing to improve soil quality and sustain healthy plant growth. This partnership of soil science and sustainable agriculture would create long term preventative methods to combat invasive species. 
Allegheny GoatScape has four herds of goats which cycle through Pittsburgh’s parks and greenspaces. “Team Diamond,” named after the donkey of the herd, grazed through Carnegie Mellon this week. The thirteen goats and one donkey live on campus for the duration of the week, and Diamond serves as their protector from canines such as coyotes or other animals that would potentially try to harm the goats at night. The thirteen goats are a collection of Alpine, Nubian, Nigerian Dwarf, and La Mancha breeds, and all have their own names and personalities. All of the goats that come to Allegheny GoatScape are rescued, and the majority of them were previously owned by dairy farmers. Oftentimes in agricultural settings such as dairy farms, the animals are not treated as well, and people then assume that they do not have personalities. “That is one of my favorite parts about the job,” community engagement coordinator Erin Guaghan said, “when the goats are out in the community people who come to visit them get to see that these animals have dynamic personalities and are very affectionate.” 
Carnegie Mellon has a long history of welcoming goats to our campus, going back to the early 1900s. In the book "The History of Carnegie Tech," one professor recalls being late for a meeting due to having to dodge the goats that were roaming the campus. While it is unlikely that professors will buy that excuse today, Carnegie Mellon continues to invite these four-legged hardworking friends targeting invasive species to campus. 
If you are interested in learning more about volunteering with Allegheny GoatScape, you can contact Erin, the volunteer coordinator, at Erin@AlleghenyGoatScape.org.  Team Diamond and the other three herds can be visited at Frick Park, Schenley Park, or the other parks they will be working in. An interactive map of the goat’s locations and more information about the work of Allegheny GoatScape and the different team members can be found at AlleghenyGoatScape.org.

This article is part of a series profiling important races in the upcoming 2022 Pennsylvania elections.
On Nov. 8, residents of the Keystone State will choose between Democrat Josh Shapiro and Republican Doug Mastriano to be their next governor. The two are running to replace Democrat Tom Wolf, who has held the position since 2015. 
Josh Shapiro has served as Attorney General of the Commonwealth since 2017. He served on the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners from 2011-2017, and prior to that he was a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 2005-2011. He grew up in Montgomery County, a suburb of Philadelphia, and attended Georgetown University, where he earned his law degree. He ran unopposed in the Democratic primary this year. 
According to his campaign website, his platform includes: investing in renewable energy; banning LGBTQ+ discrimination in the workplace, housing, and banking; banning youth conversion therapy across the state; setting up automatic voter registration and other voting rights protections. He also promises to use his veto power to prevent the Republican-majority House and Senate from passing restrictions on abortion and voting. As attorney general, he has prosecuted companies that committed wage theft, and as governor, he has vowed to protect the right to form unions and veto any anti-union "right-to-work" legislation.
Doug Mastriano is a Pennsylvania State Senator, where he has represented the 33rd district in southern Pennsylvania since 2019. His district is mostly rural, and includes Gettysburg and Chambersburg. Prior to this, in 2018 he ran to represent Pennsylvania's 13th district in the U.S. House of Representatives; however, he failed to earn the Republican nomination. Prior to his political career, he served in the U.S. army for 31 years, retiring at the rank of Colonel. He was deployed during Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and served as "the lead planner for the invasion of Iraq via Turkey" following 9/11. He received masters degrees in airpower theory, military operational art and science, and strategic studies. He also received a Ph.D. in history from the University of New Brunswick. 
According to his campaign website, his platform includes: eliminating “no-excuse" mail-in voting; passing a universal voter-ID law; ending funding for Planned Parenthood; passing the "Heartbeat Bill" (SB 378), which would ban abortion if a fetal "heartbeat" is detected, which can occur as early as six weeks into pregnancy; banning the use of public benefits for illegal immigrants; prohibiting the teaching of "Critical Race and Gender Theory Studies" in Pennsylvania schools; prohibiting transgender women from using bathrooms that match their gender identity and from competing in girls' sports; encouraging investment in fossil fuels and mining; lowering property taxes and lowering the corporate income tax rate to foster business; and ending vaccine and masking requirements. 
In addition to this, he claimed to be opposed to legalizing recreational cannabis, which he believes can increase violent crime. He has argued that "The Constitution was founded on Christian-Judeo ideas, and it's only compatible with that world view," and in reference to Islam, said that "not all religions are created equal." He also argued in favor of deporting "dreamers," undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country as children, and well as picking undocumented immigrants "up off the roads." He supports a no-exceptions abortion ban, and posits that global warming is a fake science. He believes that gay marriage should not be legal because marriage "was the first institution founded by God in Genesis," and that same-sex couples should not be allowed to adopt children. With a Republican governor, the majority-Republican state legislature would be able to pass a statewide abortion ban. 
Mastriano chartered buses to and attended the "Stop the Steal" rally in D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021. He was an important political actor in Trump's struggle to overturn the results of the 2020 election. In late November 2020, he appeared on a podcast hosted by Steve Bannon, co-founder of the far-right news site Breitbart and former advisor to President Trump, where he described his plan to "take our power back" by introducing a resolution to rescind their certification of the election and appoint new electors to represent PA in the electoral college. Considering that the governor of Pennsylvania gets to select the state Attorney General, who oversees the elections, whichever party wins the governor's race will have immense influence over how the votes are counted in 2024.  
Doug Mastriano is running an extremely unorthodox campaign. He is banking on the strength of his base to carry him through the election, making little effort to appeal to political centrists. He has spoken on One America News Network (OANN), a far-right TV news show, but has engaged extremely little with mainstream news sources. He opts instead to use Facebook Live to build a grassroots campaign that relies on his most ardent supporters. Shapiro is also massively outspending Mastriano, committing $16.9 million on TV advertising this fall. Mastriano has spent no money on TV ads and has no plans to do so. 
Polls generally favor Shapiro, with a recent CBS-YouGov poll putting him 11 percentage points over Mastriano (55 percent to 44 percent). However, the Trafalgar Group, the only pollster which accurately predicted Trump's victory of Michigan in 2016, puts Shapiro ahead by merely two points (47 percent to 45 percent). This is to say, polling is an inexact science and the race is far from decided.
In addition to the race for governor, Pennsylvanian elections include candidates for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. The Tartan will be covering these races in upcoming editions.

There currently are a variety of lawsuits against former President Trump, with Josh Robin of Spectrum News describing them as centering around his attempts to overthrow election results in Georgia, potential misrepresentation of property values in New York, potential mishandling of White House documents in his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida, and potential connections to the January 6 Capitol attack. Currently, the most notable is the Mar-a-Lago case, which has been ongoing since February 2022.  
At the end of his presidency, like all presidents before him, former President Trump was supposed to turn over relevant documents to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) for record-keeping purposes. In May 2021, Marshall Cohen of CNN reports NARA realized their records of the Trump presidency were incomplete, and contacted Trump’s team over a set of missing documents that included correspondence between President Trump and Kim Jong-Un, as well as the infamous “Sharpie-gate” map from Hurricane Dorian. The negotiations to return them spanned months, finally ending in 15 boxes being picked up from the Mar-a-Lago estate in January 2022.
Also in true Trump fashion, there was no way these documents could be returned in mint condition. Of the documents that were returned, many were not in pristine condition. Gabby Orr of CNN reports on Trump’s problematic habit of ripping up documents he was finished reading or particularly upset by, with little regard for whether the documents were old tweet drafts or important correspondence that should be preserved. Despite being asked by his chiefs of staff to stop, Trump continued this practice throughout his presidency, and Cohen reports that some of the Mar-a-Lago documents were indeed returned in pieces. Unfortunately, some of these pieces became a puzzle that NARA officials were unable to solve, as some documents could not be reconstructed.
However, this was not where the drama ended. With the records retrieved, the court battle over their handling had just begun. By February, the DOJ was involved, with Cohen reporting the official charges centering around overall mishandling of confidential material, including Trump’s destructive tendencies, the lack of preservation of social media messages and drafts, and transport of documents post-presidency to the Mar-a-Lago estate. 
The total returned was 15 boxes, with more than 100 classified documents spanning over 700 pages.
Or it would be the total — if those were all the boxes stored at Mar-a-Lago. Alison Durkee of Forbes explained how eventually NARA realized some documents were not returned, serving a subpoena for additional documents in June and eventually leading to the FBI executing a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago in August when Trump’s attorneys did not turn over remaining documents. 
The new tally is now over 11,000 non-classified documents and 100 classified ones, according to Devlin Barrett of the Washington Post. Twenty-seven of such classified documents, Durkee notes, were not found in a secure storage room, and were instead sitting in Trump’s office.
The part for the history books? This was the “first time in American history that a former president’s home was searched as part of a criminal investigation,” according to CNN. After a media clash, part of the search warrant was unsealed for transparency, revealing parts of the criminal charges themselves: potential violations of the Espionage Act, obstruction of justice, and criminal handling of government records.
This update ends on the next point of contention between the DOJ and Trump representatives — how third parties are allowed to get involved. Cohen reports how Trump filed a lawsuit asking for a third party attorney known as a “special master” to determine which documents fall under attorney-client or executive privilege, sparking more debate as Judge Cannon grants this request. With Barrett confirming five days ago that Raymond Dearie, a former New York chief federal judge, is taking on the role of “special master,” the government is now pushing that classified documents should not be included in the materials reviewed by Dearie, citing “national security risks” of revealing documents only permitted to a “small circle of top government officials.” Such classified documents would have no possibility of falling under privilege because “classified documents, by definition, are the property of the federal government.”
Of course, Barrett said, Judge Cannon rejects these arguments, claiming the classified status of these documents is up for debate despite lack of evidence from Trump’s lawyers proving otherwise.  
On Friday, Sept. 16, the Guardian reported that the DOJ appealed Cannon’s investigation hold, as this appointment of a “special master” will significantly delay the FBI’s ability to access the seized record to determine whether criminal charges apply. Such access is necessary for the investigation to continue, especially with the dozens of empty classified folders found in the estate. 
The results of the appeal, and of the overall investigation have yet to be determined. This Tuesday, when “special master” Dearie has his preliminary conference with Trump lawyers and the DOJ.

The Undergraduate Student Senate met on Sept. 15 to discuss a special allocations request and appoint new student senators to vacant positions. 
The meeting opened at 5 p.m. to roll call and approval of agenda. The first order of business was a special allocations request from CMU Hockey. President of the Carnegie Mellon hockey club Nicholas Beach gave the presentation. 
It was reported that there was an active club hockey conference in western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio that the club hockey team competed in that recently fell into decline but is starting up again. The team played two friendly games against other teams last year and is hoping to have a full slate this year. However, the club hockey team needs to pay for ice time for their games since they will host home games during their season. 
While the team is currently projected to receive $18,950, this is $3,000 short of their proposed budget that includes the ice time for home games. In the initial budget, the team did not anticipate this additional cost associated with ice time since the team was not part of a sanctioned league, but it now is. The six extra games that the team plans to play cost $335 an hour and the games are 2.5 hours each.
Joining the regional league and playing competitively is a new initiative for the club and they are not funded by the Joint Funding Committee for the ice time. According to the accompanying presentation, there is a “substantial undergraduate benefit, as students will be able to both watch and play CMU hockey to a greater extent.” The allocation for $3,000 was approved.
The next part of the session was dedicated to approving students to fill vacancies in the Undergraduate Student Senate. First-years Tala Areiqat and Thomas Xiao were elected as senators for Dietrich; First-years Nikhita Bontha and Francesca Cain were elected as senators for CIT; Third-year Gloria Lee and Sophomore Sophia Coscia were elected as senators for CFA; and first-year Mahitha Chaturvedula was elected as senator for MCS.
The Undergraduate Student Senate holds General Body Meetings every Thursday at 5:00 p.m. in the Cohon University Center Danforth Conference Room, which are open to everyone in the Carnegie Mellon community.

When Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard was listed in Forbes Magazine as a billionaire, Chouinard says "it really, really pissed me off." Now, founder Yvon Chouinard has given away the company in a move that he hopes "will influence a new form of capitalism." On Sept. 14, The New York Times broke the news that Patagonia has been mostly donated to a newly founded nonprofit called The Holdfast Collective that will donate Patagonia's profits to "fighting the environmental crisis and defending nature.". As stated on Patagonia's website, "Earth is now our only shareholder."
Patagonia, a fashion company primarily selling clothes for the outdoors, has a history of climate activism, donating one percent of its profits to environmental nonprofits every year and changing how they make their materials, such as cotton and fleece, to have less of a carbon footprint. They have participated in environmental politics as well: In 2016, they sued former President Donald Trump and the U.S. government in 2016 over reducing protected land. Patagonia has also historically been open about issues in their workplace and combating them; In 2011, when they discovered that migrant workers were paying thousands of dollars in fees to get a job with their suppliers (which Patagonia representatives described as "modern slavery"), they investigated, modified their supply chain and even presented in front of a relevant White House Forum. Fox News describes Chouinard's latest move as putting "his money where his mouth is."
In the Patagonia donation, the nonvoting stock, which is 98 percent of shares, will go to The Holdfast Collective. This means the collective will have no influence on how Patagonia will be run, but will receive Patagonia's profits, minus any money "reinvested into the business," to support environmental causes, such as preserving wild land, donating to grassroots organizations, and lobbying for related policies. The voting stock, the other two percent of shares, will go to the Patagonia Purpose Trust. The trust, overseen by the Chouinard family and their advisors, will have decision-making power over Patagonia, and is meant to ensure that Patagonia continues to fulfill its mission, which includes prioritizing worker well-being and supporting environmental activism. This setup means that while Chouinard's children remain on payroll, the family will not receive a cut of Patagonia's profits, as they are no longer shareholders.
While press of Patagonia's transfer has mostly been positive, some are scrutinizing it as a way to avoid paying taxes. Depending on what type of nonprofit you donate to, you can reduce up to 50 percent of your taxable income by donating to charities, and making donations to charities a popular option for those in higher tax brackets. This motivates some of the wealthy to carefully set up donations to organizations that promote their interests and simultaneously avoid taxes on either side.
To be clear, Chouinard's move does not fall under this category: The Holdfast Collective that he is giving the company to is a 501(c)(4), so his donation does not count for income-tax deductions and Chouinard must pay $17.5 million in gift taxes. However, reporters for Bloomberg highlight that had Chouinard sold Patagonia, which is worth $3 billion, he would have paid $700 million in capital gains taxes. So by choosing not to sell the company but instead donating, Chouinard is effectively saving hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.
It is unclear if Patagonia's donation was really out of tax-avoidance, or whether this truly will inspire a "new form of capitalism" that Chouinard speaks of. However, it does open another possibility for companies that truly want to partake in corporate activism.

On Saturday, July 16, the National Suicide Hotline changed its primary number from 1-800-273-8255 to a simple 988 dial. This change seemed to be minor, and one would assume the public would be more willing to reach out for help with an easier, more accessible number. However, this modification has sparked controversy amongst users of the phone line and individuals on the internet. The number is supposed to be a faster way to receive help, and the phone line was expected to receive millions of more calls due to how easy it is to dial. Additionally, mental health advocates hoped the line would catalyze the expansion of mental health services in locations where there may be a deficit. 
Hannah Wesolski, the chief advocacy officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness explained that this swap was made to initiate a shift in the way we react to mental health crises, and convey the message that a mental health dilemma is just as important as any other emergency. While these are great goals to strive for in the normalization of mental health disorders, there is large concern about police involvement and being involuntarily admitted into psychiatric care. Ultimately, there may have been a miscommunication in the marketing of the number as it seems to act as an emergency service as opposed to a hotline, so here is what you need to know about the new 988 “hotline.” 
The first complaints about the number arose shortly after the change and people on social media began advising individuals not to call 988.  Social media posts described the resources utilized by the 988 hotline as potentially “traumatizing,” seeing as workers have been known to dispatch the police and force emergency psychiatric services on callers. While the intent to care for people’s mental health is apparent, it is also true that this sort of forced treatment can worsen someone’s condition. Studies have shown that suicide rates can actually increase drastically after admittance into a mental hospital which are even higher for individuals admitted by force. 
The issue, from what I understand, seems to be the marketing for the 988 number. Users are treating the number as a catch-all for mental health assistance, not an emergency service. While the number is referred to as the "988 hotline" and theoretically aims to replace the old number, John Draper, the executive director of the service, described it as an “alternative to 911.” Draper also explained that the service is in place to deal with crisis, but law enforcement will be called if needed but rarely without consent from callers. Dr. Crista Critteden, Senior Academic Advisor and Psychology Professor at Carnegie Mellon, explained that the real issue lies with the intent that users are employing the line with. If the 988 number is a mental health equivalent of 911, it is only for emergency purposes and it should be made more clear that police will be dispatched if necessary. If someone is in imminent danger, it’s the police’s job to provide assistance and that is exactly what will happen with the 988 line. At the same time, the team is trained to listen to people’s problems and react accordingly, and having the line referred to as a “hotline” is certainly confusing to users who may not be expecting their situation to be handled as an emergency.
An underlying issue with this service however is that when counselors on the hotline decide that an individual is in need of forced hospitalization. While many users of the hotline are unaware that this is a possibility, 988 is once again an emergency service and counselors have authority to admit someone to the hospital if needed. The efficacy of this solution is up for debate; however, the more imminent issue with this course of action is the financial burden it places on the patient. When it is suspected that a patient is in grave danger of harming themselves, law enforcement may take action and admit said individual into hospital psychological services. This forces the individual to spend money on these services which can add an additional burden to their life. I asked Dr. Crittenden about this factor of mental health care and she agreed that the system needs to be changed, but if this is the only option to receive care it has to be done. “It’s really hard to admit someone into psychiatric care against their own will. No one wants to do that. For someone to do that there has to be a real concern for the person who is suffering.” 
There is also concern in social media posts that 988 is tracking the data of calls, but there is no real evidence besides involvement of law enforcement and their ability to track location. Overall, the concerns regarding the number change of the suicide hotline can be summarized as being an issue with marketing. The number was marketed as a replacement for the 1-800 number, but from what I’ve seen, I feel that there is a miscommunication in its function.  Law enforcement field notes on the 988 number state, “typically, crisis responses originate from people calling the general 911 emergency line for help. However, this is an inefficient way to connect people to immediate behavioral health services, as it overburdens the 911 system and may introduce law enforcement to situations that do not require a police response.” Additionally, media sources such as Bloomberg News have compared the 988 hotline as “analogous” to 911. 
Having a 988 hotline is a great idea, in theory. It not only spreads the message that mental health distress is a legitimate concern, but also provides resources for individuals who may be in areas with a deficit of mental health awareness. I think moving forward, there are a few courses of action that could be taken to improve the 988 number, starting with more clarity around its function. It’s not completely clear that it is an emergency service which is a major reason why users have been upset with their experience with the number. As for the complaints relating forced admittance into psychiatric services, I feel that this speaks more to the issues with mental health care in our country. Forceful admittance can be traumatizing, but it’s the only option we really have for reported mental health crises; so while this experience can increase distress in certain situations it’s the only available protocol. With this being said, it is important to know that if needed, the 1 (800) number is still open for calls indefinitely for hotline and counseling purposes while 988 should be used for emergency mental health care.

It used to be that every social media platform had its own usage in curating the image of perfection: TikTok began as a fun dancing app, Instagram was the only place to prove your life was desirable. So why does it look different now? What changed? Why are we suddenly obsessed with posting honesty?
It all started with the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in which we first began to see the beginnings of what we now refer to as the “photo dump." 
Essentially, a photo dump is a series of photos without any particular relationship to one another (besides maybe a time period), providing a window into the everyday lives of its creators.
With the first wave of the pandemic came the loss of the photo-op. The days of posed and planned group pictures or vacation snapshots were indefinitely postponed. Without the opportunity to continue our fixation with curated posts and planned feeds, social media did what it does best: evolve. With the spread of COVID-19, spread the casualization of social media. 
Suddenly, it became popular to share a “dump” of your camera roll. It may be a photo of a floral arrangement, a cat on a windowsill, or a blurry mirror selfie. Probably all three. Though it can seem that there is little to no connection between the photos shared in a post of this nature, there is one common factor to the photo dump: The pictures are meant to be a raw, unedited, unidealized visualization of one’s daily life. 
While this opposes the norm of hyper-edited and obviously-planned photos, it makes perfect sense. In some way, the casual dump romanticizes and creates an aesthetic out of the experience of being in lockdown. Stuck in the constant progression of “unprecedented times,” the photo dump provides an outlet for something real, or at least something that feels like it. 
In today’s day and age, even the photo dump isn’t safe from the falsities of social media. In a recent survey of Carnegie Mellon students who have posted photo dumps, 50% of participants admitted to curating and editing their “photo dump” posts. One participant responded “ofc I edit the dumps, they still gotta be aesthetic.” 
The casualization of social media, whether false or authentic, extends beyond just Instagram. TikTok, a once-popular app for sharing dancing and lip-synching videos, has transformed into something entirely different. Today, it platforms a variety of creators, from comedy to fashion to food who took to the app during lockdown in order to reach even wider audiences. What proceeded was the evolution of the app into a platform for sharing short videos of nearly any nature. While some have found comfort in finding creators that represent their interests, others have have compared the platform to other forms of social media, with one survey participant commenting, “it’s inevitable but it’s weird to see confessional things, like the same type you’d find on tumblr/reddit, without any actual anonymity.” 
The popularization of the “story time” video and the increasing comfort with sharing personal information online has also been a result of the COVID-19 lockdowns. Social media became, more than ever, a way to connect. Whether this be with friends, family, or an entire online community, TikTok provides the platform to do so. 
But how much is too much? How honest is too honest? While social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, TikTok and Facebook allow you to share everything that you think or do at any moment, is the element of choice too much? What if we were told exactly what to share and when?
Enter BeReal. As a seemingly perfect mix of authenticity and oversharing, Gen Z latched onto the concept of BeReal and almost immediately after it gained popularity through other platforms. By July 2022, BeReal had over ten million users. 
The concept behind BeReal is relatively simple. The app sends a notification once a day, at a random time, to its users. All users receive the notification at the same time. The users are then provided a two-minute window to “BeReal." Within this time frame, they press a button to take a picture with their front and back cameras simultaneously (which usually ends up showing both their face and surroundings). 
What proceeds is essentially a mass “catch-up." Anyone that you are friends with on BeReal, as long as they have made their post, can see yours and react to it. While you can post after the allotted window, your friends are notified of your late post, and it is time-stamped for all to see. 
While you are able to retake your post a few times over if there is an issue with your original snapshot, retakes are discouraged and the number of retakes is also visible to friends. Overall, the goal is authenticity. No editing. No curating. It isn’t about your life’s highlight reel; it’s about sharing what you’re really up to. 
This sense of honesty may be a valuable addition to social media culture, but where are the boundaries? Should sharing of this variety be reserved for close friends and family, or does it provide a unique opportunity to grow closer to acquaintances? Do I want to know if the guy who sits behind me in class is also struggling with the homework? 
Some view BeReal as too invasive, while others may be desensitized to sharing online. When asked their feelings towards BeReal as a form of social media, one survey participant commented “I feel nothing.” I believe that this is a sentiment shared by many BeReal users. While some may be stressed by the time frame or really enjoy sharing a moment with friends, it may be that a significant portion of users have gotten so accustomed to BeReal notifications, that they have just become another part of a daily routine. 
In an era of phishing scams and concerns of online safety, it is responsible to be more conscious of our contribution to social media platforms. But is it worth a return to artificiality for the purpose of safety? Who’s to say. 
I think it’s safe to assume that there is little agreement in the community of people that do or don’t use social media over how things should be shared online. Speaking to the general casualization of social media, one survey responded noted, “it’s great that we have this extra form of communication and connection but I think people (especially younger teens/kids) need to remember to keep themselves safe & not be tempted to overshare personal details about their lives (which this casualization encourages) because stranger danger and data collection are still very much threats and have arguably only gotten worse over time.” Meanwhile, another participant responded “I think it’s cute.”

Hi all and welcome to Novel-tea!! This new Forum column will showcase literary and language opinions of the week, so if you like hot takes and reading about cool ideas in the literary community then this is the place for you!! If you have your own hot take to add to this column, do not hesitate to contact The Tartan.
If you are a BookTok resident (the TikTok book community), then you may be familiar with the incredible up-and-coming genre “disaster girl” fiction or “female manipulator” books. The genre is characterized by its feature of unlikeable, unhinged, and unreliable women who struggle with self-destruction and a toxic, strained relationship with their society. 
The most famous “disaster girl” fiction author is Ottessa Moshfegh who rose to BookTok fame with her novel “My Year of Rest and Relaxation” which follows a narrator who describes herself as “young, thin, pretty” and is shocked she remains unhappy, so logically she slowly increases her drug usage in an attempt to sleep through an entire year. Other books in this genre include “Boy Parts” by Eliza Clark, “Mona” by Pola Oloixarac, “Happy Hour” by Marlow Granados, “Luster” by Raven Leilani, “Disorientation” by Elaine Hsieh Chou, and “Nobody, Somebody, Anybody” by Kelly McClorey. Basically if you loved Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s “Fleabag,” you’ll love this genre. 
But, why? Why are “disaster girl” books so incredible? As early as Lady Macbeth, people have been fascinated by girlboss queens who make problematic decisions. However, in the past, these characters were interpreted as cautions against feminine rage or even feminine agency, but now they are being reclaimed as feminist icons who have something truly meaningful to say about their relationship to social structures. 
I love “disaster girl” fiction not just because the characters are fascinating, but because it is nice to see women screw up for a change. At Carnegie Mellon, but also throughout my life, the need to seek perfection has been drilled into me in such a way that leads to immense fear and anxiety. But, these women give me permission to not strive for perfection and rather just be messy the way humans are. 
In an article for the blog Write Through the Night, writer Jocelyn describes that it is not that readers should romanticize mental illness in these novels but rather in seeing the less favorable aspects of the human psyche in these characters women can be released from the constraint of perfection other media often places upon them.  
“Disaster girl” books have such a hold on me because seeing women struggle deeply with their place in society is real: more real than the image of the perfect-on-paper girl next door, the manic pixie dream girl who fixes every man’s life, the mom who is simultaneously CEO and an ingenue. 
The media we are force-fed since childhood villainizes women who embrace their dark side, who embrace their agency, or who are anything less than perfect in all aspects of their lives. For once, it is relieving to see women struggle with that in a way that is messy and immoral and terrible. The human brain is complicated, and giving yourself the space to be a wreck occasionally is important. I love “disaster girl” books because they can finally let women forgive themselves for imperfection.

Though elections are still two months away, the deadline for voters to register — Oct. 24 — is fast-approaching. This isn’t a presidential election, but in Pennsylvania, the impacts may carry just as much weight. Voting in midterms is critical this year.
In 2018, the last midterm election, a record 39.1 percent of college students turned out to vote, nearly twice the 2017 rate of 19.7 percent. However, in 2018, only 45.6 percent of the Carnegie Mellon campus population voted in the election, three points lower than the national average. At the time, 74.1 percent of the student body was registered to vote. 
In the four years since, this country has seen a change in president — an election that more students than ever participated in. For the 2020 election, 81.9 percent of the campus population was registered to vote with an overall voting rate of 70.6 percent. Granted, it was a presidential election year, but it demonstrated that the Carnegie Mellon population is willing to get out there and vote.
And this year, it’s more important than ever to vote in Pennsylvania.
Current Lt. Gov. John Fetterman (D) is running against Dr. Mehmet Oz (R) for Senate, replacing [retiring](](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/05/pat-toomey-senate-retirement-426429) Senator Pat Toomey (R). If Fetterman secures the seat, it could give Democrats the majority in the U.S. Senate. 
As current Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf (D) reaches his term limit, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Sharpiro (D) is going against Pennsylvania State Senator Doug Mastriano (R) for the position. Pennsylvania is governed by a Republican-led legislature; a Republican Pennsylvania governor would give Republicans the power to pass any legislation they want. The Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, highlights how important this election really is. Republican legislators routinely introduce legislation to restrict or ban abortion in Pennsylvania; Tom Wolf is the only reason much of it has been vetoed. Mastriano has entertained notions of a no-exceptions abortion ban after six weeks of pregnancy; if elected, nothing would stand in his way of passing the legislation.
As a Carnegie Mellon students — and thus residents of Pennsylvania — we have the power to determine the outcome of these elections, which will define the rights of many across the state and nation. According to Carnegie Mellon’s 2022 Voter Engagement Action Plan, the percentage of “first-time, freshmen out-of state undergraduate students was 86 percent.” Regardless, anyone who is 18 years or older at the election, a resident of Pennsylvania and the election district for at least 30 days prior to election (as a CMU student, that’s you!), and a citizen of the United States prior to the election. 
Carnegie Mellon should ensure students have the opportunity to vote or work as a poll worker. Though Election Day is marked on the official calendar, students will still have classes on this day. If students wish to work as a poll worker, students will have to miss any classes they have, as poll workers are expected to work from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., but they are compensated for their time. 
This isn’t to say that Carnegie Mellon isn’t on the right track; there are many resources provided by SLICE for those that don’t know how to approach the voting process. There’s a page for Election Day frequently asked questions on the SLICE page, along with a link to the Campus Vote Project and When We All Vote websites. There are also several more resources for students including sample ballots, candidate information, and a polling place locator. 
Also, shout to all the people around campus (both Carnegie Mellon-affiliated and not) who have been working to get more students registered to vote. As there are two very important elections occurring (not to mention the other state and national elections), it’s important that young voters make sure their voices are heard. All those who are working to get people registered and to the polls are playing a pivotal role in determining the outcome of the next election.
Even if you don’t feel like you’ll be impacted by Pennsylvania’s midterms, students’ access to education, queer people’s access to legal protections, low-income people’s access to voting, and women’s access to bodily autonomy are all on the ballot. Don’t let your absentia be a vote against your or their rights.

Doug Mastriano is a politician who, if elected governor of Pennsylvania, would represent a massive victory for the extreme fringe of the Republican party. Not only would the office give him the power to end abortion access in Pennsylvania and to tip future elections in favor of Republicans, but his victory would signal to other equally radical individuals that their ideas are a viable campaign platform. To put it bluntly, I believe Mastriano is a fascist. 
Fascism is a loaded term used by both sides of the aisle to malign their opponent. Like "tyranny," it can be construed into anything you dislike, but fascism has a very specific definition. As briefly as possible: fascism is a political movement that reacts to liberalism and leftism by using xenophobia and machismo to prop up a cult of personality around a single (invariably male) leader who forms an alliance with establishment conservatives to defeat left-wing ideologies; it is syncretic, meaning it blends with existing cultural beliefs and imagery; it progresses in stages, and succeeds depending on how complicit the population is with their rhetoric. Robert Paxton, a political scientist who specializes in fascism, describes it as a "dictatorship against the left amidst popular enthusiasm.” With this in mind, let's look back at Mastriano.
He is personally and feverishly devoted to Donald Trump. He does not believe in the separation of church and state. He stokes fear of transgender acceptance, explicitly opposes gay marriage and the right of same-sex couples to adopt children, and is obsessed with the moral backsliding of American society. His campaign website promises to "restore Pennsylvania to the shining beacon of hope and freedom it once was.” 
Let's explore some of his other positions. Mastriano emphasizes the need to prevent illegal immigration, but that's pretty on par with other Republicans. I want to talk about one particular thing he said regarding DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), a policy which protects children brought to the U.S. without documentation. When asked if he would protect "Dreamers" — the name for those who benefit from this policy — he replied, "What about the American dreamers? What about our own people?" For those who aren't aware, a common dog whistle among white supremacists is the term "Us" and "Our People" (generally capitalized). These come from a slogan known as The Fourteen Words, which states: "We must secure an existence for our people and a future for white children.” I'm not necessarily saying that Mastriano was intentionally using this dog whistle, I'm just saying that he sure seems to be thinking in line with those who do. 
Furthermore, it wouldn't be unreasonable to see his campaign as just the next step in this crusade to alter our electoral system. As governor, he claimed that he would utilize the power to "decertify every machine in the state with the … stroke of a pen.” Keep in mind that the state flipped in Biden's favor by a mere 80,555 votes. Given Pennsylvania's place as the political fulcrum of the nation, the party in charge of the state has tremendous power to dictate how elections are run in this state.
If you really want to go off the deep end, you can read up on Julie Green, a woman who spoke at a Mastriano rally and who believes in the QAnon conspiracy as deeply as any human possibly could. She claims — I am truly not exaggerating — that Nancy Pelosi is a literal witch who consumes the blood of children as part of a satanic ritual. "She loves to drink the little children’s blood. By drinking this blood, they believe they will receive a longer life. Yes, a true witch she really is. She was part of sacrificing the children to Baal. She loved murdering for him." Mastriano decided to appear beside a person who sincerely believes this. One of Josh Shapiro's attack ads really did say it best: "The more we learn, the crazier it gets.” 
Just when I thought I was done writing about Doug Mastriano, I learned something truly incredible. In April of 2001, he conducted a "research project" while enrolled in the Air Command and Staff College. He speculated that anti-military sentiment will "set the stage for a Hitlerian Putsch, which leaves the military on the sidelines unwilling to save the republic.” Mastriano’s thesis paper centers around a piece of science fiction he wrote from the perspective of a fictional U.S. Army colonel transcribing the events of this Putsch "by flickering candle light in a damp Virginian cave" in the year 2018. (The name of this character is Nathan Greene, which just happens to also be the name of an artist who paints scenes from The Bible and American history, and I refuse to believe that's a coincidence.) I read all 65 pages of this utterly deranged screed so you don't have to. Here are the SparkNotes: in 2012, a group of shadowy political elites faked a military coup to justify enacting policies that curbed military power and weakened military culture. Then in 2018, the U.S. government is overthrown by a demagogue named — I wish I was kidding — Benedict Aurelius, who "abolished the Constitution, dismissed Congress, and compelled the President to resign.” To consolidate his power, Dictator Aurelius then instituted martial law, purged millions, and sent people to reeducation camps to impose "his form of political correctness" on the populace.  According to the story, the military was powerless to intervene thanks to decades of political correctness, moral relativism, "aberrant sexual behavior in the ranks," and the dilution of the "macho warrior spirit," all of which had transformed the military into a "neo pagan…docile service institution." The newly formed E.U. and U.N. militaries had replaced the U.S. as the ascendant world power, and gladly funneled funds and troops into the "dismemberment of the U.S." He has a bizarre fixation on moral decay and sexual hedonism, claiming that "the assault started with the insertion of homosexuality into the military," and that "like Rome, domestic moral decay and slothfulness proved to be a more formidable adversary than foreign armies.” It is a rambling, poorly-written mess that confuses ideology with storytelling. He goes on a strange tangent to rant about how a specific, real-life military official is a hypocrite. He makes absolutely insane predictions about how political correctness, sexual anarchy, and alternate religions will turn America into a "morally vacant" society. Recall Robert Paxton, the scholar I quoted earlier. He also describes fascism as "a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation of community decline, humiliation or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy and purity." This thesis by Mastriano really amounts to a fascist manifesto. 
I'll leave you with my absolute favorite part. According to Mastriano, the 2000 election swung in favor of Bush due to military absentee ballots in Florida. In his fiction, the liberals, enraged by this, make it harder for active duty soldiers to vote by mail, successfully depriving them of their right to vote. This is absolutely hysterical to me. The anti mail-voting policies he once feared would be used to prevent soldiers from voting are the same policies he wants to enact in Pennsylvania. Any justification he gives about the integrity of elections is hypocritical nonsense; Doug knows exactly what he's doing. 
Unless your home state swings at least as hard as Pennsylvania, I implore you to please change your registration to the Keystone State. Pennsylvania has once again found itself at the center of American politics, and it is imperative that Doug Mastriano does not win. 
If you found this article interesting, next week I'm going to write part 2, where I focus on Dr. Mehmet Oz and his extremely questionable history of hawking dangerous medical supplements on his show.
