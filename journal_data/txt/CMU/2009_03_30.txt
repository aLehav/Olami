Breaking the Carnegie Mellon triple-jump record as a first-year, Ivana Moses has already made her mark on the school’s track and field program. Moses is no stranger to holding records, as she is revered in her high school’s hall of fame at Phillips Exeter Academy and has records in the triple jump and 55-meter dash, along with being a gold medalist in 2007 and a silver medalist in 2008 in the triple jump in the New England Prep School Track Association. Moses plans to keep her goals high and has her sights set on excelling in the 100- and 200-meter dash races during her collegiate career as well.
With the Olympics as a big influence on her love for the sport, Moses has also been interested in volleyball because of the supreme competition that Olympians provide. Moses regards professional sprinter Allyson Felix, who won gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics for the 4x400 meter relay, as one of her idols in the track and field world. Once Moses finishes her career at Carnegie Mellon, she hopes to be able to keep competing with a local track club and to stay involved in the sport by helping to coach at a Boys and Girls Club or neighborhood school track teams.
While away from the track, Moses stays busy with school work as she focuses on a degree in economics. Academics aside, Moses maintains several hobbies, such as photography, listening to music, and dancing. As far as a favorite music choice, rhythm and blues and hip-hop artists of the 1990s are at the top of her list.
“I grew up listening to them and enjoyed the true emotion and creativity in their music. For me, it’s the best music to get me ‘in the zone’ for a race,” Moses said. Her interest in dance can be seen in her past involvement with her high school’s step team and in watching dance competition television shows, such as FOX’s So You Think You Can Dance?
Moses’ hometown is New Rochelle, N.Y., and while she chose to attend college away from home in Pittsburgh, Moses would like to live in New York after she graduates to pursue a corporate career. While she is here, Moses has been making the most of the life of a Carnegie Mellon student, attending meetings and events held by student groups that are dedicated to spreading diversity awareness. A member of SPIRIT and ASO (African Student Organization), Moses is taking the opportunity to experience aspects of the diversity that this university has to offer.
With her success so far, Moses is someone to watch for in her future endeavors as a Tartan scholar-athlete. The track and field outdoor season is underway, and the team looks ahead to its upcoming meet this Friday and Saturday at Washington & Jefferson College.

First-year Michael Cheng led the Carnegie Mellon golf team to a first-place tie with Susquehanna College at the McDaniel Spring Invitational, held at the Bridges Golf Club in Abbottstown, Pa. this past weekend. With 15 teams in attendance and over 80 competitors, all five Tartans finished in the top third, contributing a final 310 total that was 22 above par. Following the Tartans and Susquehanna, Franklin & Marshall College fell four points behind in third place, and Nazareth College trailed 39 points at 61 above par.
“The weather conditions definitely made it tougher to score well, but I tried my best to be patient knowing that everyone was experiencing the same thing,” Cheng said. “Everyone was looking forward to competing and redeeming ourselves after a poor performance last week.”
Originally, the invitational was supposed to go to 36 holes, but due to slick course conditions and thunderstorms, the tournament was called after 18 holes. Despite the abrupt conclusion, the Tartans showed well and took the top spot with three of their five in the top 20 players.
Senior Alex Timmons ended in an eight-way tie for seventh place, with 77 strokes or five above par. To follow, junior Christopher Lee also ended the tournament in a tie, sharing the 15th spot with six other golfers who concluded the tournament with 78 stokes at six above par.
Senior Joshua Chen claimed a four-way tie for 22nd place with 80 strokes, eight above par. To close out the Tartans’ standings, first-year Terence Einhorn also grabbed an eight-way tie for 26th at 81 strokes, nine above par.
“Overall, everyone on the team played well, and we are looking to do the same tomorrow,” concluded Cheng.
This afternoon, the team will compete in the Titan Spring Invitational held at the New Castle Country Club in New Castle, Pa.
“I am proud of how the team played,” said coach Rich Erdelyi. “The weather was cold and the course was wet with bumpy greens. All things considered, we shot some good scores given the difficult conditions. We beat three teams that were ranked above us. This is critical, as we position ourselves to have a chance at meeting our season-long goal of making nationals.”

The Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team kept its rock-star season going this past weekend, winning 9–0 Friday at Grove City College before coming back home Saturday to bulldoze Kenyon College 8–1. The Tartans improved their record to 17–1 on the season and continue to earn their current and impressive number-three national ranking.
Playing with a squad of six instead of the usual nine on Friday, the Tartans kicked things off by overpowering Grove City’s doubles teams in all three matches. Junior Alisa Liebowitz and sophomore Danielle Rosenfeld led the charge by beating the Wolverines’ Elissa Beale and Natalie Walten 8–1, while the team of sophomore Jennifer Chui and first-year Amanda Wu also won 8–1. In the singles, Rosenfeld once more led the way, defeating Grove City’s Reena Barnett 6–0, 6–0.
Back in Pittsburgh at the Club 4 Life, the Tartans once again got off to a strong start with the doubles against Kenyon. The team of Chui and Wu started by defeating the Ladies’ Erin Ivanoff and Julia Diskint 8–3 to set the pace before first-year Courtney Chin and sophomore Kelly Hart won 8–4 and first-year Laura Chen and sophomore Ashley Herrick battled to an 8–6 victory. On the singles side, Rosenfeld once again trounced her opponent 6–0, 6–0, to leading to an eventual 8–1 Tartans victory.
“Playing Kenyon was a great experience,” Wu said. “Although I was third position instead of my usual second position, I still had to work hard to win. I’m proud of the team for blowing Grove City off the court the day before with only six girls.”
On the team’s number-three ranking, Wu said, “[Last week] we almost beat Washington & Lee, who is ranked second, but we have another chance in May. We’re going to have a chance at number one in the NCAA when we play [number-one ranked] Williams, so we’ll see.”
The Tartans next play April 13 at home on the campus courts against California University of Pennsylvania. They also will have a makeup match scheduled against the University of Pittsburgh.

After two matches on the road a week ago, the Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team stayed close to home last Friday and Sunday, facing the ninth-ranked Kenyon College Lords and the fifth-ranked University of Mary Washington Eagles indoors at Club 4 Life in Monroeville, Pa. Unfortunately, the Tartans lost 3–6 to Kenyon but rallied Sunday to defeat Mary Washington 6–3. The win over Mary Washington is a first for the Tartans in 15 years. They now stand at 12–5 for the season.
“We definitely had our chances and lots of openings to get ahead, but we just didn’t take advantage of them,” said junior Niko Ljuboja. “We could have been a little sharper here and there, and it’s the little things that can make the difference between winning and losing.”
The match against Kenyon started with the Tartans down 2–1, with the one point coming from the second doubles duo of junior Ravi Raghavan and sophomore Alex Nemerov. Sophomore Bobby MacTaggart then added a singles win to the count, steamrolling his opponent 6–2, 6–0 and bringing the overall score to 2–2. The last win came from junior Jon Spero at fourth singles, 7–6 (7–5), 6–2. However, much to their disappointment, the Tartans were unable to hold off the Lords and dropped four singles matches.
“Kenyon is a very tough team and, although we gave it our best, they just outfoxed us today,” said first-year Jeremy King. “The loss of two doubles just put us in a hole that was too hard to climb out of. It was not optimal at all.”
The next match against Mary Washington proved to be a better day for the Tartans, who were able to regroup and beat the Eagles 6–3. After an amazing display of focus and determination, the Tartans swept all three doubles, with junior James Muliawan and Ljuboja winning 8–6 at third doubles. The 8–6 win from the duo of Spero and MacTaggart at first doubles was especially impressive, given that their opponents were ranked eighth nationally last year. The third point came from Raghavan and Nemerov with a close 9–8 victory.
In singles, the momentum gained from the doubles sweep made the Tartans almost unstoppable. At first singles, Muliawan won after a hard fight, 7–5, 2–6, 6–4. MacTaggart continued the winning pattern and defeated his opponent 7–5, 1–6, 6–4, followed by Spero, who wiped out his opponent 6–1, 6–1.
“I think the whole team was really pleased with our overall effort this weekend against two very good teams. Our fight in doubles against Mary Washington was unbelievable given that we were down a break at all three positions,” Spero noted. 
“Bobby really stepped up for us these last two matches, and James had a great win today as well. We hopefully will get another shot at Kenyon in a few weeks. We took a lot away from this weekend and we know where we need to improve.”
The Tartans resume play this week Wednesday 7 p.m. at home against Duquesne University.

From east to west Pennsylvania, the Carnegie Mellon rowing club proved a force to be reckoned with as it recorded strong performances in two 2000-meter races — the Murphy Cup Regatta held in Philadelphia on the Schuylkill River last Saturday and the University Athletic Association (UAA) Regatta held at Lake Arthur in Moraine State Park north of Pittsburgh yesterday.
Despite optimal weather conditions the previous day, Saturday proved to be cold and cloudy, although not too windy, which made it hard for the rowers to warm up between events. With numerous East Coast schools in attendance, the Murphy Cup proved to be a success for the Tartans, as the men’s lightweight varsity 4+ team of senior Brian McGraw and sophomores Justin Perry, Sean Lubner, and Ed Burns claimed first place with a time of 7:02.26, finishing ahead of NY Maritime, University of Pittsburgh, and St. Joseph’s University.
“In the heats, we had a lot of power, but we didn’t have a good rhythm,” Burs said. “So although we were able to scrape through to finals, we knew it wasn’t going to be enough if we didn’t row together and with power. Luckily, we managed to get it together on the warm-up before the final. I think it’d be an understatement to say we were very happy about the race.”
The women’s varsity 8+ brought home a third-place finish in a time of 7:40.42.
The women’s varsity pairs of seniors Natalie Weir and Judith Vogel claimed first place, with juniors Megan Larcom and Alyssa Fogel taking second and sophomore Hilary Baribeau and senior Danielle Millet finishing fourth.
“It was definitely tough for [the duo], being the first race of the season,” Weir said. “But we had great competition and we’re happy with how the race turned out — it gave us a good benchmark of where we’re at and where we need to improve.” Weir and Vogel also went on to win the same race at the UAA regatta yesterday.
To conclude the regatta for the Tartans, the novice men’s 4+ team of first-years Chris Burchhardt, Grant Wilson, and Brice Relaford; sophomore Jonah Coste; and first-year coxswain Chris Shellhamer brought home fourth in a time of 7:23.78.
The less-than-desirable weather carried over to Sunday’s races, even delaying starts an hour due to thunder and lighting. Once the races commenced, the conditions only got worse as the wind created turbulence on the water and one of the Tartan pairs flipped their boat. Overall, the rowers were not satisfied with their performances, but the Tartans still managed to record notable wins. Weir and Vogel tallied another varsity pair first-place win, and the men’s varsity lightweight four with the same rowers as the previous day also claimed third.
Carnegie Mellon presented the Milikowsky Cup to the winning men’s lightweight 4+ team from Washington University in St. Louis. The cup is given in honor of late Carnegie Mellon novice coach Jonathan Milikowsky, who died of cancer at the age of 23.
The team will compete in the Car-Du-Pitt Regatta at Washington’s Landing this Saturday.

This past weekend, the Carnegie Mellon track and field teams kicked off their outdoor seasons by competing in the unscored Washington and Lee-Virginia Military Institute Carnival, competing against other Division I, II, and III programs including both co-hosts, Messiah College, Ohio Wesleyan University, and Duquesne University. Despite the poor weather conditions, both the men’s and women’s teams saw several strong individual performances, especially in the long-distance races.
For the men’s team, senior Ryan Anderson dominated the 3000-meter steeplechase with a time of 9:28.34. Behind Anderson, junior Chris Rizzo followed to finish in 10th place with a time of 10:13.66. Sophomore Nate Bussiere had a busy day, taking sixth overall in the 1500-meter run (4:02.22) and 15th in the 800-meter run (1:59.50).
In the 5000-meter run, senior Brian Harvey led the team and finished first overall with a time of 14:51.30. Sophomore J.P. Allera also excelled in his event, the 10,000-meter run, taking first overall with a time of 31:29.26.
In the 400-meter hurdles, senior Craig Hahn and sophomore Pat O’Brien took second (56.10) and ninth (58.38), respectively. Hahn also finished second in the 110-meter hurdles with a time of 15.70.
In the jumping events, junior Chris Bridgman placed first with 4.33 meters in the pole vaults. Sophomore Dan Melamed cleared 3.88 meters to take fourth overall. In the triple jump, junior Eric Couphos and first-year Ryan Kissell finished seventh (12.73 meters) and 10th (12.08 meters), respectively. O’Brien jumped 1.78 meters to take sixth in the high jump.
Junior James Hulley had an impressive day, placing second in the shot put (15.13 meters) and fifth in the discus throw (41.26 meters). In the discus throw, first-year Anthony Hernandez and senior Chris Fornataro finished sixth (39.62 meters) and ninth (38.58 meters), respectively. Hernandez had another strong performance in the hammer throw, taking third overall with 46.83 meters.
On the women’s side, there were many highlight performances. Junior Diane Mattingly placed third in the 400-meter dash with a time of 1:01.40. Junior Crystal LeePow and first-year Luci Laffitte took fifth and seventh, respectively, in the 400-meter hurdles. Laffitte also placed fourth in the high jump with 1.48 meters.
“I think I ran well today. I took off about four seconds from my previous best time,” LeePow said. “However, the weather conditions were poor. It was constantly raining and the track meet had a lot of delays because of timer problems.”
In the 1500-meter run, sophomores Courtney Baker and Laura McKee finished sixth (4:53.76) and 11th (5:01.06), respectively. 
Senior Chrissy Krutz placed fourth in the 10,000-meter run with a time of 43:00.61.
In the 100-meter dash, senior Emily Giacomarra placed 10th overall with a time of 14.21. Senior Ashley Rothwell had a solid day, finishing ninth in the javelin throw with 28.11 meters and seventh in the shot put with 10.30 meters.
The women’s 4x400-meter “A” team also put up good numbers, finishing second with a time of 4:10.32.
Although very few of the new underclassmen ran this weekend, they are expected to play a larger role in next week’s meet. The Tartans will resume their schedule this Friday at Washington and Jefferson College.

Statistics from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients reveal that nearly 78,000 patients throughout the U.S. are on the waitlist for receiving kidney transplants. Considering this dire state of affairs, a system that can match needy patients with available donors more efficiently is extremely necessary. Computer science professors Tuomas Sandholm and Avrim Blum, along with David J. Abraham, a graduate student in the computer science department, came up with an algorithm that is capable of efficiently matching donors to patients. Currently, newer versions of the algorithm are being developed by Sandholm and Pranjal Awasthi, a graduate student in the machine learning department.
Blum explained that a variety of factors decide whether a kidney donor and recipient are compatible with each other. Particularly, if the donor and recipient’s blood type and proteins of the group known as the major histocompatibility complex do not match, the recipient’s body will elicit a strong immune response against the transplanted organ. Hence, the donors and recipients have to be carefully matched for a successful transplant. 
Usually, relatives of patients needing a transplant are willing to donate their kidneys, but, more often than not, these donors are not compatible with the patients. There may be many such incompatible donor-patient pairs. However, a donor from one pair may be able to donate his or her kidney to a patient from a second pair. 
If the donor of the second pair is compatible with the patient of the first pair, both the donors can switch places and the required transplant operations can be performed as planned, albeit with different donor-patient pairs. This forms the basis of paired kidney donation.
With a database containing the results of preliminary compatibility tests of over 10,000 donor-patient pairs from all over the country, the donor-patient pairs can be matched with each other in a variety of ways. 
The team at Carnegie Mellon decided to tackle the momentous task of developing an algorithm that performed the matching in a way that maximizes the number of patients who could receive transplants from the possible donors.
“There might be multiple ways one could do [the matching] and some of [the ways] might end up with more people getting kidneys,” Blum said. To explain this concept, Blum illustrated an example with four donor-patient pairs: A, B, C, and D. Suppose the donors of pairs A and B can be switched, and the donors of C and D can be switched, then the patient from each pair has a donor. 
However, consider that the donors of B and C can also be switched, but those of A and D cannot. If the switch were performed between B and C without taking into account the presence of A and D, patients from A and D would be left without kidney transplants. The main purpose of the algorithm was to prevent something like this from happening. 
“The idea was to get this large collection of people and then you could find the best possible ways of doing the matching,” Blum explained. Blum elaborated further by saying that the larger the pool of donor-patient pairs, the larger are the chances of finding good matches. Hence, the group wanted to come up with an algorithm that could be used for a very large group of people. “The challenge that we were going to solve was could we come up with procedures we could scale up to 10,000 [donor-patient groups],” Blum said.
Sandholm agreed that the issue of scaling the algorithm to such high numbers was the greatest challenge they faced, and perhaps also the reason why they took interest in solving the problem in the first place. “I was on the program committee of the International Congress of the Game Theory Society 2004.... We invited Al Roth to be a speaker there, and he talked about kidney exchange. Then it became clear that the algorithms solving who was going to give [kidneys] to whom weren’t scalable. So I decided that’s probably a place where computer scientists can help significantly,” Sandholm said.
Coming up with the algorithm was not that easy, and many changes had to be made to the originally developed algorithm. “In my lab by now, we’ve generated several generations of the algorithm,” Sandholm said. “Some of the newest improvements have to do with the dynamic aspects of the problem. New patients and donors are going to come in and the algorithm should be smart about how it handles [the new donor-patient pairs].” This is work that Sandholm did with Awasthi.
A consequence of the research was the development of Never Ending Altruistic Donor chains. In such cases, an altruistic donor, who is not paired with any patient, donates a kidney to a patient part of a donor-patient pair. The donor of the pair can then donate his or her kidney to the next donor-patient pair, whose donor can donate the kidney to the next pair, and so on. The chain terminates with one leftover kidney that can be used to initiate another such chain. As Sandholm put it, “It’s like a gift that keeps giving.” 
As published in the March 12 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, such a chain was recently started using the algorithm, and 10 people have successfully received transplants through the chain so far. The project has thus shown that it has great potential and can immensely help the medical community. 
Although the current algorithm is being developed for kidney transplants only, Sandholm believes that this has a large impact, as kidney transplants are by far the most prevalent transplants. “If you work on kidneys, you can save as many lives as if you work on all other transplants combined,” he said.

If anyone were to list similarities among outer space science fiction movies, the results would be predictable: giant spaceships, warp speed, intelligent aliens; there might even be audible explosions in the vacuum of space. While none of these actually exist yet (that we know of), technology is rapidly catching up to our childhood interstellar dreams. Optical tweezers are one such form of technology. Optical tweezers are loosely based on the fictional tractor beams, popularized by Star Wars and Star Trek.
Tractor beams are a kind of energy beam that focus on an object in space, forcing it to move toward the ship without actually coming into contact with it. Or, they might hold cargo in place, or even rip distant objects apart.
Of course, this is complete science fiction. Large-scale tractor beams do not exist yet outside of our imagination. However, an optical tweezer can be thought of as a microscopic tractor beam; it is a focused laser used to attract or repel microscopic objects. Holding particles, called optical trapping, facilitates the study and manipulation of atoms and other small or large molecules.
An article on the Bell Labs website explains that the first atomic trap, using a focused laser beam, was conducted at Bell laboratories in 1984. The paper written by Arthur Ashkin of Bell Labs was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) and explained the working of the optical traps.
When a laser beam is focused on an object through a microscope lens, the laser beam creates an electric field. Forces are produced by the object’s interaction with the electric field and the light itself. The laser beam produces a strong electrical field gradient, with the region of the strongest electric field in the center of the beam. This is kind of like a garden hose with a thin nozzle — the farther one is from the center of the water spray, the less water there is. 
The object tends to move to the center of the laser beam, where the electric field is strongest. In addition, forces are produced when the laser light is scattered as it hits the object, and when the laser light is refracted through the object.
The reason the particle stays in the center of the beam is because of the sum of the forces acting upon the object itself. In the center, rays of light refract or scatter through the object the same way on both sides, resulting in the cancellation of forces moving the object sideways. When the object drifts to one side, it returns to the center, because the greater electric field causes a greater force to be exerted on the object in the direction opposite to its drift. This is analogous to a spring — when displaced from its equilibrium position, an opposing force will cause it to accelerate back to the center.
Optical tweezers are truly a revolutionary connection of physics and biology. Currently, optical tweezers have trapped many objects for study, including viruses, bacteria, living cells, and strands of DNA. There are many practical applications in various scientific fields. Cells can be sorted or organized, as optical tweezers can place them exactly where a researcher wants. In addition, optical tweezers have been used for measurement in studies involving forces. 
Researchers can attach a single cellular motor molecule, a kind of molecule involved in cellular movement, to microscopic beads. In this way, they are able to conduct experiments on a single molecule. This is a scientific breakthrough, as cells usually have many motor molecules to help it move in its environment.
The production of optical tweezers is still extremely expensive, and usually involves the modification of a commercial optical microscope. Many lasers have to be equipped extremely precisely, and researchers have to keep in mind that biological samples must not be killed during experiments. There have been many successful implementations of optical tweezers, and better methods of trapping particles are constantly being studied and proposed.
The potential of optical tweezers for full-scale tractor beams is extremely slim; however, for medical research, it is promising. Researchers can alter larger cellular structures like cell membranes, test breaking strengths of DNA strands, and track bacteria movement. 
Of course, the entertainment field is quick to capitalize; there is a video online of Tetris being played with glass microspheres, which have a diameter of only 1 micrometer. The video can be found at this site: http://www.nat.vu.nl/~joost/tetris.

Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder that affects the control of sleep and wakefulness. This disorder is characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and sudden attacks of sleep. People with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness and intermittent, uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the day, regardless of the circumstances. 
The cause of narcolepsy is unknown; however, it is believed that genes that control the production of chemicals that regulate sleep and wake cycles play a role in it.
As explained in an article in The New York Times, researchers now believe that narcolepsy may be caused by a deficiency in the production of a chemical called hypocretin by the brain. Studies show that cells that make hypocretin are severely damaged in narcoleptic patients. 
Although it is unknown what exactly damages hypocretin cells, abnormal immune response could be the cause. Also, the disease seems to be genetic; if one family member has narcoplepsy, his or her relatives are more likely to develop it.
In a typical sleep cycle, people enter the early stages of sleep followed by deeper sleep stages and ultimately REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. For those suffering from narcolepsy, REM sleep occurs almost immediately in the sleep cycle and periodically during the hours in which they are awake. 
It is in REM sleep that people can experience vivid dreams, sudden lack of muscle tone, and sleep paralysis (the inability to move or talk while sleeping), which explains some of the symptoms of narcolepsy. The primary characteristic of narcolepsy is overwhelming drowsiness and an uncontrollable need to sleep during the day. This is exemplified by patients’ tendency to fall asleep without warning, anywhere and anytime, even while working and talking with some friends. This sleep can last from a few minutes to half an hour before the person awakens, but the whole episode occurs again soon afterward. 
The website of the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) explains that another common symptom of narcolepsy is the sudden loss of muscle tone, called cataplexy. Cataplexy can cause a range of physical changes from slurred speech to complete weakness of most muscles. 
Cataplexy is uncontrollable and is often triggered by intense emotions (usually positive ones like euphoria, or sometimes negative ones like fear). Those with narcolepsy can experience cataplexy a few times a year or numerous times a day. 
Hallucinations, known as hypnagogic hallucinations, are also common in patients just as they are falling into REM sleep. As described on www.medicinenet.com, another interesting symptom of narcolepsy occurs when the patient engages in automatic behavior during an episode of the disease. Sometimes, narcoleptic patients continue doing the tasks they were engaged in for a couple minutes after falling asleep. The tasks are usually not performed as efficiently as when the patient is awake. For example, if the patient is driving, he or she may get lost or have an accident while suffering from an episode of narcolepsy. After performing such automatic behavior, however, the patients awaken with no memory of performing any such tasks.
Narcolepsy usually begins between the ages of 15 and 25, but can become apparent at any age. However, many cases remain undiagnosed. Upon first suspicion, the doctor may take a sleep history to assess any other factors that would help explain the symptoms. 
The history involves filling out the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, which uses a series of short questions to gauge a person’s degree of sleepiness. The doctor may then issue a polysomnogram, which measures the electrical activity on the brain via electrodes placed on the scalp, heart, muscles, and eyes. Another test to confirm a diagnosis of narcolepsy is the multiple sleep latency test. This examines how long it takes a person to fall asleep during the day. Narcoleptic patients usually enter REM sleep much faster than those without the disease.
Although there is no cure for narcolepsy, the symptoms of the disorder, such as excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, can be controlled with drug treatment. For example, sleepiness is treated with amphetamine-like stimulants while symptoms of abnormal REM sleep (i.e. cataplexy and vivid dreaming) are treated using antidepressants.

Physicists recreate old atomic model
When atoms were first discovered, they were compared with the solar system, and it was believed that the nucleus was like the sun and electrons revolved around it. Later, quantum mechanics contradicted this analogy and stated that electrons smear out over large areas.
Tom Gallagher and his team at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, however, have come up with a model that represents the traditional view of the structure of an atom. They achieved this by trapping electrons and guiding their movement around the nucleus.
The concept is based on the principle of Lagrange points, which are regions of space where no gravity exists. The researchers used microwaves to counteract forces of the nucleus on the electron so that the electron was no longer influenced by the nucleus. Hence, the electron came under their control and they could guide it around the nucleus by moving the microwave source.

Scientists find asteroid remains
Researchers have discovered 8.7 pounds of black jagged rocks in the Sudan desert. The rocks are leftovers of the asteroid 2008 TC3 and were full of small diamonds.
Scientists believe that the study of the rock gives them an idea about the history of planet formation and how to avoid a future asteroid-caused Armageddon.
The rocks are the remains of a specific asteroid that was a fireball plunging through the sky before it landed on the surface of earth. This asteroid burned 23 miles above the ground and is believed to be a part of the rocks that tried, but failed, to become a planet 4.5 billion years ago.

Google adds undo send tab to Gmail
Everyone at some point or another has sent out an e-mail that they never wanted to send. In order to fix this problem, Google has introduced a Gmail feature known as “Undo Send.”
The feature gives users five seconds to undo their send so they can fix their typos, correct their settings, or rewrite the entire message. When a Gmail user who enables this feature sends a message, an “Undo” button will pop up on the screen for five seconds. If the user hits this button within that time, Gmail will retrieve the message in draft form, allowing them to change it or delete it entirely.

Professor speaks at physics conference
Carnegie Mellon cosmologist Tiziana Di Matteo spoke on a panel at a recent meeting of the American Physical Society on computational physics. Her work focuses on black holes and evolution of the cosmos through the use of computer modeling. Her models simulate the galaxy formation using the TeraGrid system at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing center.
In her abstract for the conference, she wrote that recent advances in the field of cosmology have been mostly due to the use of computer modeling and that computer simulations can take into account factors like the effects of gravitational fields generated by dark matter and different galaxies.

Botox helps stroke, dystonia patients
Botulinum toxin, better known as Botox, has many different medical uses aside from making fine lines and wrinkles disappear. It helps dystonia victims, who have uncontrolled or slow movements, regain control of their muscle spasms. It also helps children who have clubfoot avoid surgery.
Although Botox is not approved by the FDA as a treatment for stroke patients, it is used off the label as a stroke medication. While primary care doctors often don’t know about its potential benefits, patients who have had Botox treatment often look and feel better and find it easier to dress, hold objects, and bathe themselves.

Scientists use skin to make stem-cells
Researchers from the University of Wisconsin released a study last Thursday showing how they were able to change skin cells into “induced pluripotent” cells by adding growth genes that disappear after the new cells reproduce. Since the growth genes disappear soon after cell division, the cells no longer contain the cancer-causing genes that were discovered in previous experiments.
These induced pluripotent cells have the ability to turn into all types of tissues, which gives researchers hope that they could one day be used to replace organs. Since these cells are not harvested by destroying embryos, they lack the controversy surrounding the human embryonic stem cells.

Biochemists make new protein
A team of biochemists from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine used design and engineering principles learned from nature to build a new type of protein completely from scratch. This is a great accomplishment as it assists scientists in studying the structure and function of proteins that are otherwise very complex to study.
The newly created protein is an unusually small and simple protein that is similar to the human neuroglobin that transports oxygen in the peripheral nervous system and the brain. It is believed that this new approach of creating a protein from scratch could help in making artificial blood for use by emergency-care professionals or on the battlefield.

Scientists link hot tea to throat cancer
It has been known that tobacco and alcohol lead to cancer, but a recent study by Iranian researchers showed that very hot tea can also lead to throat cancer. The researchers say that any steaming beverages should be allowed to cool down before consumption.
The study showed that those who drank hot tea at a temperature greater than 158˚F were eight times more likely to procure throat cancer than those who sipped lukewarm or warm tea at a temperature less than 149˚F.
The discovery was a result of studies conducted regarding the tea-drinking habits of 300 people with esophageal cancer and another 571 healthy men and women from the area around Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

The idea of studying abroad has a fascination that catches everyone’s attention. The thought of traveling away from home and visiting another country, not as a tourist limited to hotel rooms but as a traveler, living and eating the way the citizens do, sounds exciting and adventurous.
Carnegie Mellon offers its students ample opportunities to go on an adventure and learn from another country (read about students’ study abroad experiences in Tales from Abroad), but, for many students, studying at Carnegie Mellon itself is an adventure. International students come from all over the world, ranging from far-east countries like South Korea to European countries like Scotland.
Why the U.S.?
The reasons for studying abroad in the United States are many. Some are studying abroad for the cultural experience, while others because of the academic excellence that the U.S. offers.
Vicki Johnstone, an exchange student from Scotland and a junior English major, sheds some light on her reasoning behind coming here. “I always wanted to do a study abroad but never knew exactly where…. I had been to America twice before on vacation and have always really liked America and all that it offers. I had hoped when I was growing up to be able to live some place like America and felt that going on an exchange to here would enable me to gain some experiences and see how life works here,” she said.
Tubtim Eawchoowongse, on the other hand, focuses on the quality of education she can gain by studying here. She is from Thailand and is a sophomore electrical and computer engineering and economics double major. She traveled here “because the U.S. offers a more flexible education. At Carnegie Mellon, for example, I could take classes outside my department and pursue other areas of my interest.”
Other students base their decision on the difference between the education system in their country and that in the U.S. Young Woong Park, an international student from South Korea and a first-year electrical and computer engineering major, explained in an e-mail that admission into South Korean universities is very difficult and is solely based on academic performance. “However, in the U.S., students are highly encouraged to develop their own interests by participating in club activities,” he went on to write. “Even if a student in the U.S. has a bad GPA or bad SAT scores, if he/she has interesting extra-curricular activities, he/she has a very good chance of getting into a good university. People might have different preferences about these two educational systems; however, I didn’t like the Korean educational system as it forces students to study, no matter what their aptitudes are.”
What’s different?
One of the most interesting things to note is how other countries differ from the U.S. Be it a variation in the units of measurement used or the side of the road on which vehicles are driven, many differences are noted by international students between the way things function in the U.S. as compared to their own countries.
Johnstone complained about the confusing and unhelpful nature of the banking system in the U.S. that constantly results in her getting overcharged with hidden fees. She also noticed that taxes aren’t added until the item is billed at the register. “I always think that I have the right amount and then go to the register to pay and they stick on another 7 percent….!”
Stefan Gutstadt, a junior business administration and French double major, comes to Pittsburgh from Johannesburg, South Africa. According to him, one of the most notable differences between South Africa and the U.S. is that while in the U.S., the predominant language is English, South Africa has 11 official languages. This makes communication in the U.S. much easier.
Gutstadt also thinks that South Africans are more politically active than Americans. “I feel that people back home take current events extremely seriously, and there are often public marches, rallies, or gatherings concerning pertinent issues,” he explained. “Once, I remember a national union stopped the traffic in Johannesburg for several hours during a government wage dispute.”
Park pointed out that the diversity that exists in the U.S. is not present in South Korea. “There is only one race in Korea, but in [the] U.S., there are many different kinds of races living together,” he wrote. “Also, [the] U.S. is much larger than Korea; we can go everywhere by a car in Korea but not in here.”
You say po-tay-to, I say po-tah-to
One of the main difficulties in transitioning into life in a new country is adjusting to the ever-present cultural differences. These differences may be small, like the usage or pronunciation of a word, or large, like the way people interact with each other in social situations.
Manasi Patil, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major and an international student from India feels that culturally, “the way [Indians] define friendship…, the way the weather does or doesn’t affect, the way [Indians] behave with our professors” are just some of the vast differences between Indian and American culture.
Johnstone feels that the major difference between American and Scottish culture is the use of words in different contexts. “I would say the main differences are to do with speech.... We’d say ‘bin’ instead of ‘trash can,’ ‘rubbish’ instead of ‘garbage,’ ‘petrol station’ instead of ‘gas station,’ ‘sweeties’ instead of ‘candy,’ ‘juice’ instead of ‘pop,’ ‘plaster’ instead of ‘Band-aid,’ ‘crisps’ instead of ‘potato chips,’ and ‘chips’ instead of ‘French fries’” she said. “It can get a little confusing!”
In countries like South Korea, China, and Thailand, on the other hand, the cultural differences extend beyond just everyday speech. In these countries, behavior in social situations differs remarkably. It’s important to note these differences so you don’t make a faux pas when you visit.
“Body language,” Christine Lee, a senior economics and philosophy double major, immediately identified a cultural difference between China and the U.S. She emphasized that while people in the U.S. find it normal to hug while greeting guests, this is not the norm in China. Excessive touching is not typical, and people prefer handshakes instead.
The code of conduct in classrooms in South Korea is slightly different. “The first thing I was surprised about when I came to the U.S. was when I attended classes, students crossed their legs and put their legs on other chairs in front of professors, which is viewed as rude in Korea,” Park wrote. In order to be respectful, Koreans maintain decorum in front of elders.
Eawchoowongse seconds this difference in behavior toward older people. “Thai people tend to be more polite and reserved. They also tend to be respectful to elders and would not make fun or tease them unless they are really close,” she said. “Whereas I found that in the U.S.,... a sense of humor is always a bonus, and the best way to connect with others is to approach them actively with a smile.”
Looking more closely at the differences in ways of living, Gutstadt emphasized that “South Africans … tend to have a more relaxed outlook on life.… Several of my friends working in Cape Town have a strict ‘rad waves’ policy to stop work and go surfing if the sea and sun are right.”
Overall, studying abroad is a great opportunity for students to get out of their comfort zone and experience something they have never seen or heard of before. All the students mentioned above affirm that life at Carnegie Mellon has been interesting and exciting, and all the initial adjustments, whether it’s language or weather, are short-lived. So, take a chance and discover another country.

Last Tuesday evening, Carnegie Mellon students piled into McConomy Auditorium for a prescreening of the new film Adventureland. A dramedy in the style of Superbad and other Judd Apatow movies, the film centers around 22-year-old James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) and his less-than-ideal summer job working in the Adventureland theme park. As horrible as it seems to the recent college grad, his summer job becomes a “full-scale initiation into the sublime oddities and wonders of adult life,” as Miramax puts it. Set in 1987, the movie centers around Brennan’s relationship with Em Lewin (Kristen Stewart of Twilight fame) and is ultimately a story about the quirkiness of a cheap theme park, the characters who work in it, and how Brennan’s experiences with them help him grow up and discover who he is.
Adventureland was written and directed by Carnegie Mellon alumnus Greg Mottola (CFA ’86), who based the movie on his own experiences after graduating from college and being forced to take a job working at the real Adventureland theme park on Long Island. 
“Working in an amusement park was such a silly job, and it’s one of those jobs you feel stupid working for minimum wage and you wish you could do something better,” he said. “But it’s also such a tremendously fun summer. It really captured everything I probably love and hate about life out there.” James Brennan, a neurotic, innocent virgin, was based very closely on Mottola’s younger self. “I definitely had a lot of the same awkwardness and earnestness and misguided ideas about what relationships are. When I decided to write something personal I thought, ‘Well, let’s try and get it close to what I remember, and maybe this will feel familiar to the people who are going through the same fumbling attempts at growing up,’” he explained.  
Many of the most poignant features of the film come from its setting, in both the time and place. Based in 1987 (around the time Mottola himself worked in Adventureland), the movie takes on a distinct ’80s feeling, from the fashion to the music, and even the impact of the Reagan economic downturn. Still, much of the themes and events in the film can translate to our generation. 
“It’s a tricky thing now,” Mottola said. “Young people are really facing an uncertain future. And that moment after college, I certainly remember coming out and saying, ‘I learned so much in college and I learned absolutely nothing that will prepare me for the real world.’”
Though Mottola wanted to place the film on Long Island, where his memories took place, the setting was relocated here to Pittsburgh for budget reasons. “It was a little hard for me to give up the idea.... When we first came to scout Pittsburgh, I was arriving there with the thought that maybe I’d try to pretend Pittsburgh was Long Island and hold onto the Long Island idea. But as soon as I started to drive around the city and the nostalgia for my college years came back, I thought, ‘Well, that’s stupid. I should really make it about Pittsburgh.’ I mean, I really love Pittsburgh; it has so much character. I was so reminded of that time in my life that it seemed stupid to fight against it.” 
Its ultimate relocation to Kennywood allowed the filmmakers to give Adventureland an older, shabbier, more rustic feel that was difficult to find in modern-day corporate theme parks.
“I tried to make it look a lot smaller and a lot more condensed and a lot more like the way I remembered Adventureland,” Mottola said. “You know, more humble and down-to-earth, and you knew it had a really great family-run quality.” 
Mottola’s experiences at Carnegie Mellon also had a major effect on the prominent ’80s music featured in the film. 
“A big part of my life at college was the excitement of listening to all this music I hadn’t heard before, meeting people who were a little cooler than I was, and turning me onto great underground bands,” he said. “The first time I listened to The Smiths and The Replacements ... all that stuff happened at Carnegie Mellon. So, much of the music in that film was from my life then, and it had a huge influence on the finished movie.” The movie has many famous ’80s songs, including “Rock Me Amadeus,” and also features songs by Lou Reed and The Rolling Stones. 
Junior English major Vicki Johnstone attended the prescreening of the film and noted the amount of enthusiasm for Pittsburgh’s presence. “Every time Pittsburgh was mentioned, or every time we could totally see it was Kennywood, we were totally cheering and stuff. I’ve never experienced anyone clapping at the movie screen like that before. We were all singing along to the music and clapping,” she said.  
Mottola enjoyed filming at Kennywood. “When we made the film they let us ride the rides. [Kennywood] has like the greatest wooden roller coasters I’ve ever been on; they’re actually really, really good,” he said. “That’s how we would unwind because of the stress of shooting. We would just go on that a couple times in a row; it rattles your brains out.”
Adventureland comes out in theaters Friday, April 3.
 Kennywood park opens May 2.

My Boys, an original series from TBS that first aired in November 2006, is set to launch its third season Tuesday at 10:30 p.m. The show stars Jordana Spiro as P.J. (her actual name is Penelope Jane), an attractive, twenty-something sports columnist, and deals with all types of scenarios that arise from being a twenty-something female. The quirk about P.J., who is also the narrator for parts of the show, is that P.J.’s core group of friends are all guys, hence the title of the show. A tomboy in the truest sense of the word, she smokes stogies, plays poker, and goes to bars with “her boys.” P.J. finds that her friends sometimes make her life difficult in the romance department, though in season three, that may not be an issue anymore, with a potential hook-up in the works. But for now, let’s look at the unusual cast of characters who surround P.J. as she goes about her daily life.
First, we have stand-up comic Jim Gaffigan as Andy, P.J.’s brother and the most settled-down guy in the group. Next we have Bobby, a sports columnist for a rival publication who comes from an obscenely wealthy family. When season three begins, Bobby is about to wed a beautiful Swedish woman, but the question remains: Will he even make it to the altar? Brendan is a handsome ex-DJ who can always be seen wearing a rock T-shirt and spends much of his time being a ladies’ man and avoiding work. Mike is the dimwit/jocky/stereotypical loudmouth of the group. He is hired by Kenny, another of the “boys,” to work in Kenny’s sports memorabilia store. Finally, we have Stephanie, P.J.’s only female friend, who is a well-known relationship guru and the author of a best-selling advice book. Now that the introduction is complete, we can look at a review of the show itself. It seems as if some casting director got a little trigger happy when it came to bringing on additional actors. It’s extraordinarily difficult to fill 22 minutes with enough information about just one to two characters, let alone seven. And by often including all characters on screen at the same time, each person tends to blend in with the next, making it seem as if “boys” like Kenny, Brendan, and Mike really aren’t all that unique, but when put together make for a fairly interesting person. 
This brings up another problem with the show. So many plotlines that could have been golden material are left to flutter away as the show moves along. For example, with lines where Family Guy would cut away to a short clip about an absurd event, My Boys just gives up. It’s true that they aren’t at all the same type of show, but the writers are leaving a lot on the table. By trying to squeeze into 22 minutes an update on every single character along with some story arc, there just isn’t much time to actually get a feel for the series and where it wants to go.
But, at the same time, there are actually plenty of positives with this show. While it doesn’t exactly have a wacky premise, the show is original in having one female lead surrounded by so many male co-stars, even if P.J. does kind of blend in with the rest at times. In addition, My Boys has the distinction of being a show you can tune in to any time and find a welcoming cast of people you can love to love, unlike Lost and 24, as well as so many reality programs out there today. Starting from next week, it has a 9:30 p.m. time slot on Thursdays. It may not be the groundbreaking new show everyone’s been waiting for, but for a relaxing half hour in front of the tube, you could do much worse than My Boys.

CBS’s Big Brother, MTV’s The Real World, and VH1’s Flavor of Love can’t compete with the talent and raunch that the Bricolage Theater Group presented Friday, March 20, for their fourth annual fundraiser. On a night that began with a Chicks With Dicks T-shirt giveaway and featured an open bar, approximately 150 intrepid Pittsburgh theater insiders and Carnegie Mellon students filled a raucous, drunken proscenium-seated audience. The gratis booze and sushi, and the one-of-a-kind performance benefiting the city’s brightest talent in the theater community, came close to justifying the $40 price tag.
B.U.S. 4 Bricolage Urban Scrawl featured local theater artists creating and presenting six different 10-minute productions created in under 24 hours. Inspired by playwrights’ 90-minute journeys on various city bus lines on Thursday, directors and actors then had 12 hours to rehearse, memorize, and stage each script to debut on Friday night. The results amounted to a manic, bloodshot-eyed, inside-jokey corpse of a production — for those students willing to brave the downtown wilds of 937 Liberty Avenue and snooty conversations in the venue lobby. It felt like a crash test in experimental theater.
All six productions featured sharp, and alternatively black and slapstick humor that scored big laughs, at least among the members of the audiences who seemed to have personal relationships with performers. Of the six performances, “Aren’t you Richard Johnson?” and “28X” stood apart as serious, Beckett-ian meditations on language and serendipity. Granted, all six productions at least partially overcame the confining reality of bus-stop chit-chat. These chats occur between strangers, and can only reveal the faintest snapshots of acquaintances and relations in a space defined by its occupants’ transience.
Written by Rick Schweikert, directed by Sheila McKenna, and featuring Dave Flick, Eric Anderson, George Dalzell, and Lonzo Green, “Aren’t You Richard Johnson?” opened at a bus stop where four men were waiting. One, a University of Pittsburgh student holding a six-pack of Rolling Rock, realizes that another, a balding middle-aged man, may be a poet he likes named Richard Johnson. A burly, laid-off factory worker and a presumably homeless or high older man holding a bundle of flowers stand nearby. The homeless man hypnotically chanted at emotional beats in the piece, while the confused student, alleged poet, and laid-off factory worker argued over the alleged poet’s actual identity. The cross-generational and socioeconomic tensions boiling just beneath the surface of the piece made it a success. The metaphors flew furiously, and a few lines of competitive verse managed to achieve poetic nirvana. The three arguing actors had their moments of literary genius — we never find out who the real “Richard Johnson” was, though the manic man with the flowers and chant, the one they all disregarded and ignored, ironically was the character with the most cadence and rhythm to his speech.
Another piece —“28X” by Robert Isenberg, directed by David Whaen, and starring Karen Baum, Mary Harvey, and Don Digiulio — captured all the franticness of a young aspiring actress with a live-in mother. She turns to a dark-eyed stranger for comfort after seeing her mother off on a bus, and proceeds to pour out her melodramatic soul. The guy seemed nonplussed, but engaged her neurosis just enough to make their relationship interesting. He was in finance, she wanted to be an actress; they end up hopping on the next plane to Los Angeles — sounds like a hackneyed cliché, but they pulled it off. The writers of both these pieces might be worth checking out in the future.
With all the frantic energy of a midterm all-nighter on acid, and occasionally with a genuineness that theater artists with months of preparation might fail to achieve, B.U.S. 4 entertained and occasionally soothed the soul. The booze break in the middle made for a wild crowd, and the Chicks With Dicks T-shirt giveaway at the beginning injected just enough salaciousness to make it an arousing way to kick off a Saturday.

“What is privilege but multiple choices?” — Zed McGladdery, School for International Training community health program director
I’ve been in Durban for two months now, just past the halfway point of my study abroad program in which I learn about community health. South Africa is a country of intense contradictions. 
It seems like there are two worlds — the legacy left behind by apartheid. The privileged live in comfort, similar to Europe or the United States. The impoverished, who are by far the majority, are living in a developing country where access to health care is not guaranteed, food for children is not always sufficient, and unemployment is an always-looming shadow. 
During my home stay, a six-week period that served as my introduction to South Africa, I plunged into the uncomfortable but eye-opening differences poverty presented me with. The following words were written about two weeks into my home stay, as I grappled with my circumstances:
I’m staying in a lower-class area, Cato Manor, called a township, which consists of all black, government-owned projects. Staying here has made me realize the incredible privileges I have been raised with and the powerful circumstances everyone in America lives in. Even the color of my skin means that, because of the history of this country, I am granted more reverence and more respect, whether or not I ask for it.
This weekend, on the phone, my mother asked me how it felt to be a minority. She was surprised when I answered, “Guilty.” When I got to my home stay, my bag took up the entire path on one side of the bed. “So much stuff!” my new African mama said. I unpacked, placing my branded shampoo and face wash on the tub, which had socks drying on the washtub inside it. I placed my soap, the exfoliating kind with a small dove carved in the surface, beside their generic green bar. I was so thankful that at least their toothpaste was branded, and this eased my mounting guilt.
Before I left home, my sister and I had been whining that the hot water heater was not working properly and only provided hot water for the first five minutes of a shower. On arriving in Cato Manor, I did not have a shower at all, much less hot water. 
My family and I don’t even use half of my house in the United States, whereas the living room here is used for everything, and is, well, small, at least by my previously held standards.
Dinner is very heavy in starches and fats — fruit and vegetables are sparse, and the ones that are around are typically only served to me. The food that is cooked is eaten for every meal of the day (though a smaller portion is provided at lunch) until it is finished several days later. 
I am served cornflakes and specially prepared jam and butter sandwiches. Even within my home, my family treats me as a special guest.
I now realize how much stuff I have. I thought I had only brought my essentials with me: A week’s worth of clothes, three pairs of shoes, various cosmetics and toiletries, two cameras (one is for my photo essay later on), an iPod, three books, two journals, and some outdoor things. 
Granted, I have made use of most of these things, but I realize that I could also live without a majority of them. They are comforts that I have learned to see as necessities, but many of them, such as books — never mind the cameras or the iPod — are things people in Cato Manor have never had. 
On my first night, my mama mentioned that I could watch TV after she went to bed. When I replied that I would rather read instead, she said, “Oh, always good to keep learning.” Education is held in high esteem, but books are too expensive to afford.
The fact that we have the choice to educate ourselves and our children — and at the university level — is remarkable. Most of us, at least in the middle and upper classes, can choose to study without worrying about having to send money home to support our families. 
I know only two people my age in America with a child, whereas women of the same age in most parts of the world, definitely in South Africa, have at least one child. 
The fact that I can pick up and leave the United States and have the money and the freedom to just wander the globe speaks to my incredible privilege. 
Mama has no choice but to work, and even she still couldn’t afford a gift for her daughter’s 13th birthday last week.
Though I am living within a lower-class home-stay environment, every day I leave for some time for my community health classes, which are situated in a higher-income area. I, along with 22 other students, have classes in a house that is located in an area that was classified as “white” under times of apartheid. 
We have showering facilities, fruits, vegetables, air conditioning, and a pool. All of us type away on our laptops, and we have this space to be “rich.” I’m still wrestling with the ethics of this situation. Should we have fruits, cameras, laptops, a spacious area, and time to debate health policy, when the average resident of Cato Manor does not? 
Of course it’s impossible to totally balance the playing field, but there are some steps we can take to not be so spoiled, as well as some things we can do to improve the situation of people like our home stay families; for example, we can increase their access to health care.
In the meantime, people on both ends of the wealth spectrum are taking time to appreciate and learn from one another.
Since I’ve written this, I’ve more or less come to terms with my wealth. I can’t change my background, nor can I change the background of the families I stay with. I’ve also realized that it’s not expected of me to do either of those in order to stay with and learn from these local families. 
I bonded with my home stay mother as if she were my own blood. Last week, we moved out of my home stay, a place where we watched back-to-back soap operas, lived with no ceilings, and woke up at 5 a.m. to the sound of roosters crowing. 
I’m now staying in a gorgeous beachfront apartment where I have a balcony to watch surfers and waves instead of house music to rock me to sleep. But guess where I’d rather be staying?

Stressed and depressed by classes, social obligations, and relationships? Just wait until you meet Natalie Bloom, Patricia Weitz’s protagonist in her debut novel, College Girl. You’ll be amazed at the myriad ways college life can go horribly, terribly wrong.
Natalie, a junior Russian history major, has just transferred into her dream school, the University of Connecticut, in what must be the most awkward way possible. She arrives in time for the second half of her junior year, having never lived in a dormitory at her old school and always commuting back to her parents’ house after class was over. Paired with 25-year-old rocker chick Faith as her new roommate and insecurity complex, Natalie has only to set foot outside McMahon Hall’s door to find disaster.
Natalie starts out as a straight-A student, studying in the library during every bit of free time she has, even on Friday nights. There, she encounters Patrick, who makes a pass at her during one of her test review sessions and who continues to factor largely in her daydreams in the weeks leading up to exams. Unable to concentrate on studying because of her crush, Natalie goes to a fraternity party with a friend, and then starts smoking after going to another party with Faith. Patrick, who does marijuana religiously, convinces Natalie to try some with him, and later tries to get the utterly inexperienced Natalie to “hook up with him” in just about every sense of the phrase.
Failing courses left and right, simply because she doesn’t believe that she can do well on them anymore, Natalie slowly deteriorates into a nervous, chain-smoking wreck. From that point on, College Girl delves into the land of the melodrama, wherein Natalie doubts everything about herself: her academic motivation, the subjects she likes, her tastes, and who she is as a person. While loss of self and then rediscovery is something that will be familiar to almost any college student, Natalie is almost unrecognizable. Formerly confident to the point of cockiness about her grades, she allows herself to be used by Patrick for sex on a regular basis and is distantly mortified by her plummeting GPA.
There is one redeeming moment when Natalie, sick of the rumors she’s heard about Patrick preferring girls with long hair, goes to a cheap salon and gets a buzz cut. From this, the reader might hope that a resurgence of self-worth and self-esteem might ensue, but no such luck. Submissive and dutiful, Natalie continues her relationship with Patrick, meeting up with him over break in vacant cemeteries and night-time parking lots.
Almost as an afterthought, Weitz interjects periodic memories of Natalie’s older brother Jacob, who committed suicide a few years earlier. Natalie, through her increasingly unhappy and unsatisfying rendezvous with Patrick, develops a bitter, self-loathing streak. She almost follows along the same path as her brother, but changes her mind at the last moment. From there, Natalie dumps Patrick and begins to explore being an adult on her own, including going out with one of her stripper friends, clubbing, and hooking up regularly with random guys on Friday nights.
While College Girl highlights some of the most commonly experienced scenarios in dorm life (for example, walking in on your roommate having sex, going through various meltdowns in an attempt to find yourself, wild parties, and lackluster institutional food), it combines all of them into one big super-disaster for Natalie to try and cope with. Natalie, unsurprisingly, ends up cynical and dreamless, and by the end of the book doesn’t even bother to help out a former friend of hers stuck in the same kind of bad relationship that she and Patrick had. “Have fun,” Natalie thinks, as she walks away, leaving the deluded girl to her fate.
Just to top it all off, toward the end of the novel Natalie finds out that her family never thought that her going to college was a good idea in the first place. On the whole, it seems like Weitz tried to make College Girl realistic and all-encompassing, but instead came off as being unreal and depressing, offering the message that Natalie was almost better off not trying anything at all.
On the bright side, though, if you’re convinced that you have it bad, College Girl should give you every reason to start loving your life again.

There is a lot of music out there. Within the current music industry, most of the big record companies seem intent on marketing only big names within established music genres. However, as a result, many great albums slip through the cracks in America. There are music blog sites that are attempting to rate music that the big websites and magazines simply do not have the space in print to assess, but most people don’t have time to search the Internet for music. Here are some CDs that have not reached the popularity that they deserve.
Animal Collective — Merriweather Post Pavilion
The blogosphere lit up with the release of Merriweather Post Pavilion in January this year. Here’s how this album can be explained: take a rhythmically intriguing, percussive band that typically releases very complex albums that are very hard to understand for the mainstream consumer, and make an extremely accessible album with an amazing flow that never lets go of its hold on the listener. Animal Collective hit a bull’s-eye with Merriweather Post Pavilion. This album has beat-thumping songs, slow and haunting sprawls, the occasional perfect set of lyrics, electronic flourishes, and so much more. It still takes about 20 or so plays of the entire album to get it, but there are several songs that appeal to the listener right away. Two minutes and 30 seconds into the first song, “In the Flowers,” Animal Collective has you hooked and will demand your attention through the album’s entirety.
Rivers Cuomo — Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo
Rivers Cuomo, the singer of Weezer, is a very prolific man. In addition to the six albums with Weezer, Cuomo has been recording demos for many years. In 2007, he decided to release a compilation of many of these demos with Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo. This collection is fantastic as it involves the return to his Pinkerton and Blue Album era songwriting. “Lover in the Snow” is a notable track, as it mixes his typical sad-sap lyrical style with crunching guitars and well-placed handclap beat. With the release of Alone, it seems as if Weezer would have been better off with Cuomo writing and performing all the songs himself.
David Byrne and Brian Eno — Everything That Happens Will Happen Today
Strange, weird, interesting, and old are the words to define the pair of Byrne and Eno. Eno was the producer of the Byrne-led band, Talking Heads, throughout the ’70s. Despite the Talking Heads’ splitting up, Eno and Byrne decided to team up to release an album, Everything That Happens Will Happen Today, in August of last year. The album features Byrne’s typical voice and Eno’s sonic atmosphere, combining together to produce an album that recalls Talking Heads’ early songs. Even though this album may not be your cup of tea, give “Strange Overtones” a listen, as it is a song that makes people sit up and pay attention.
The Zutons’ discography — Who Killed the Zutons?, Tired of Hanging Around, You Can Do Anything
Do you have The Zuton fever like the Brits? The Zutons reached high on the British charts, but have not gotten a high appeal anywhere on this side of the Atlantic. Released in 2004, The Zutons’ first album, Who Killed the Zutons?, is a high-energy blast of alternative rock. With sharp guitar solos and clear vocals, The Zutons are all about making new classic rock albums. They mix and meld the various successful formulas that classics like The Who, The Rolling Stones, and Led Zeppelin used, while adding their own unique charm. The group’s newest album, You Can Do Anything, was released in June of last year and follows the same formula. “What’s your Problem,” a throwback to the feel-good ’70s rock-stomp, is an instantly appealing track that demands a couple of smiles and foot-thumps.

Don’tcha wish your girlfriend was hot like Britney?
So do we. 
The Pussycat Dolls opened the Britney Spears’ Circus concert last Friday at the Mellon Arena. Scantily clad women who paid roughly $700 came in droves to trollop backstage, gawking at Spears’ dressing room door and waving good bye to Mama Spears on the way to the VIP standing-only section of the concert floor. 
The Dolls started with a bang, singing live with glittery microphones and wearing midriff-baring outfits. They brought the audience to their feet with live renditions of “Buttons,” “Jai Ho,” and “I Hate This Part Right Here.” All of the Dolls were fantastic dancers, executing complicated moves and painful stretches with ease.
After the opening act, the pre-show began, complete with clown theatrics, acrobatics, and martial arts. Perez Hilton starred in an introductory video and then the curtain went up and the real circus began. 
Spears appeared from under the curtain dressed as a circus ringmaster in bright red and gold and captivated everyone with her hit single “Circus.” After a quick costume change in which Spears donned a tiny black and gold outfit, she came out on stage in a golden cage singing “Piece of Me.”
Each act continued with more extravagance than the last, including a stunt in which Spears was blindfolded and carried into the air by two men attached to a trapeze. Halfway through the performance, Spears announced that she was going to slow things down and began to sing the ballad “Everytime.” She sang this song while sitting in the crook of a suspended glittery umbrella revolving over the stage. 
One of the most vibrant costume dances was Spears and her dancers’ Bollywood-esque performance. With bright and shiny Indian clothes and an Indian beat to “Me Against the Music,” the performance was vivid and captivating. The show was choppy, as it was interrupted by numerous costume changes. During one lengthy costume change, the circus performers from the beginning of the show returned to the stage.  
To show appreciation for her dancers, one segment in the middle of the show spotlighted each dancer showing off his or her individual skills. After two hours of performing, Spears and her crew closed the circus with “Womanizer.” She took her bow, walked off stage, and left the crowd wanting more. Some would say that the show was short, perhaps because no one can ever have enough of Britney.
The concert didn’t feature many songs from Spears’ new album, and the popular, high-energy songs crowds crave were few and far between. While the overall concert performance was amazing, there were some scenes in which Spear’s dancers were definitely out-performing her.

Due to popular demand, the School of Applied Design is opening an illustration department. The department is being created to give full training in drawing, painting, and design. Mandatory courses for students interested in this major include Freehand Drawing, Geometry, and Problems in Illustration. Those who graduate are perfect matches for the well-sought-after positions of lithographer, piano sheet music illustrator, and calligraphy specialist.

Even 50 years ago, Carnegie Tech had the audacity to put some humor in their annual April Fools’ Day issue. Under the title of “Sex” reads, “Sex has nothing to do with this story but it did get you to read this, didn’t it?” The “100 Years Ago” entry in this article took several hours of coercing before agreeing to stand beside this scandalous blurb.

The ’80s also had a humorous spirit. In their April Fools’ edition, WRCT advertises its “Tragic Music Weekend.” Telling its listeners to “tune in and turn us off,” the mock playlist includes K.C. and the Sunshine Band, Bread, and Madonna, who also has a less-than-appealing illustration titled “Like a Slut.” Thankfully, 1984 was the last year Madonna would do anything controversial.

In more serious news, a Carnegie Mellon chemistry professor develops a new method for bleaching certain materials. With this new advancement, people can now mix white clothes with colored ones and not worry about dye mixing. Several undergraduates were involved with the professor’s discovery and could be easily identified by their ruined clothes, or “test” clothes.

The Crime and Incident section reports a garbage fire in a bathroom in Morewood Gardens. Firemen performed a chemical cleanup of the area, but causes for the fire were unknown. Several speculated that students were attempting to create a solution that bleached colors as well as whites. If only they had known about the Golden Age of Carnegie Mellon’s chemistry department.

Dear Joe,
Facebook made such a mistake when they let people not in college join. My aunt requested to friend me, and without thinking, I accepted it. She’s a wonderful aunt to have, but she keeps sending messages about my dirty language and how I’m her honey bear. Should I de-friend her? That might make the next Thanksgiving dinner a little uncomfortable.
—Poked in Porter
Dear Poked,
Or shall I say honey bear? The first mistake you made was accepting someone as a friend who might cause issues with your account. But honestly, is it that bad?
Frankly, I get messages all the time from my family. I have uncles with requests to join groups about native pizza joints, aunts asking if everything’s alright, and a brother and a sister who are on the same boat that I am. I feel that it adds a little bit of familiarity to my life, even if they aren’t so happy about any sketchy pictures that may be posted.
Not everyone is on excellent terms with their relatives. If it’s really making you uncomfortable, you can either de-friend your aunt or change your profile and keep deleting her messages. The latter option, believe it or not, is a much worse gesture than the first. It’s even worse than refusing to eat her pickled beets at the next Memorial Day picnic. In the end, you have to accept that you’re an adult here. If you don’t want to deal with a contact, regardless of who it is, you can always cut the tie. Just remember, though, that this is the same person who drove you to soccer practice and kissed your cuts to make everything better. Given that, I think a few Facebook comments are a relatively minor occasion.
Say uncle,
—Joe
Dear Joe,
I’m trying to figure out what kind of person I am. It’s interesting, because I dress trendy, but I don’t smoke cigarettes, and I like emo music. Somebody even said that I was a goth once. Who knows? I might even be a jock, because I like playing basketball. Any suggestions on finding myself?
—Searching in South Side
Dear Searching,
You have got to be kidding me. The whole “What group am I in?” game ended when you received your high school diploma. You should have been jumping for joy that you could just be yourself in college. Maybe you belong in the “I didn’t get the memo” group.
Seriously, Searching, I wouldn’t spend any more time trying to put a label on yourself. There’s enough stuff in life to worry about. The economy, the quality of campus food, and your atrocious QPA are three fine examples. Whenever people start worrying about what clique they fit into, it’s often because they’re not taking enough time to learn about other people. With that said, Searching, strike up a conversation with the strange kid sitting next to you in class. Chat it up with the janitor who cleans your dorm’s bathrooms. To avoid becoming self absorbed, the best solution is to squeeze yourself out to others. Give it a try. That is, unless you think I’m a jerk, because you totally shouldn’t listen to jerks.
Just don’t be emo, 
—Joe

Writing this column is making me grit my teeth. It has finally happened — I have lost my external hard drive. Fifty GB of music — vanished. 
The Bamboo Pipe Orchestra of Marseilles? AWOL. That recording of my French students wishing my mother “Happy Birthday”? Gone. The new album from techno master Gui Boratto? Sayonara.
It’s amazing to me how much of my life was bound up inside that prism of black plastic. 
It makes me feel like an old man, one who senses that it is not just his own life fading away, but that of the very means he used to record it. 
My hard drive was a Super 8 camera: my bevy of blog-borne MP3s, a trip to the Poconos in ’74.
The fact that I kept all of my music on an external, and one with fewer than 100 gigabytes of space, rather than an array of iPods and 10 gigabytes thumb drives — that alone makes me something of an antiquarian, an eccentric unworthy of sympathy, like the man crouched beneath his broken-down Dodge Dart on the side of the road.
I’ve seen pictures of the moldy hills of albums hauled out of the Attic record store in Millvale after the flood in ’04: David Bowie’s hair weirdly mottled, as if it had corroded in the sun; Wilson Pickett’s smile a bleary, gaping grimace. 
There was some dignity in the sadness of that destruction. A storm had hit; objects were defaced.
The disappearance of this hard drive, however, is dumb and without density. I lost it — it was not taken from me. And what was lost was invisible — a data stream now thinned to a nonexistent bandwidth.
Is this how it will be for the so-called iPod generation? Our memories slicked in an instant, the backed-up data of our lives vulnerable, not to hurricanes or wars, but to simple carelessness? 
Or will we, having lived lives that were filmed, recorded, Twittered, and forwarded from their very first moments, bear a heavier burden than today’s elders, who thumb through leather-bound scrapbooks holding only a few dozen photos?
Is a memory’s weight found in its presence or its absence?

Tens of pounds of spaghetti were in sight in the University Center on Friday as students raised money to improve the vision of poverty-stricken families around the world. Alpha Phi Omega, the co-ed service fraternity, hosted an all-you-can-eat spaghetti dinner with all proceeds going toward Unite For Sight (UFS), a nonprofit volunteer organization aimed at educating people on and eliminating preventable blindness, both locally and internationally.
Lauren Campbell, a junior biological sciences major and member of Alpha Phi Omega, spearheaded Friday’s dinner in an effort to raise money for her volunteer trip to India this summer to work with a rural, poverty-stricken eye-care clinic.
According to Campbell and the UFS website, 80 percent of blindness is curable or preventable, leaving 36 million people needlessly blind.
“There’s a lot of need in this country, but it gets even more extreme when you go abroad,” Campbell said. “You know you’re directly impacting people who really need the help.”
All students wishing to volunteer for UFS in the summer are required to raise $1500 individually for the organization — Campbell hoped to accomplish this goal with the dinner.
In addition to the money, students are asked to get 300–600 pairs of eyeglasses donated to UFS and to shadow an ophthalmologist in order to be ready to assist the doctors in daily treatments, such as vital checks, screenings, and real-life surgeries including cataract removal.
Campbell spoke excitedly about how just one routine cataract removal can mean the return of sight for a person who has been blind for 40 years due to a lack of access to medical care.
While Campbell’s dinner focused on the international goals of UFS, the organization itself has multiple sections.
Alice Zhang, a junior biological sciences major and leader of the local Unite for Sight chapter, explained the difference between the two main branches of the organization at Carnegie Mellon.
“The first part, the fundraising [Global Impact Corps], is for international communities that are stricken by poverty and, in some cases, by war. One hundred percent of the funds goes to areas like Africa and Asia to promote eye care,” Zhang said.
“The second part, the vision screening and vision education, is local to Pittsburgh and something the volunteers in our organization actively participate in.”
“We are teamed up with the Guerrilla Eye Service (GES)  from UPMC, which is a group composed of professional ophthalmologists, residents, and medical students.” 
UFS also hosts a global health conference and, as in the case of Campbell, sends students abroad to help with their eye clinics around the poverty-stricken world. 
Carnegie Mellon has a student campus representative to provide information to students on volunteering abroad through UFS.
Zhang spoke of the importance of eye treatment internationally.
“Without sight, we are crippled. We have those beeping traffic signs in Pittsburgh, and on campus there are Braille signs so that the blind can still live and work normally like everyone else, but in places like Ghana and India, no one is granting the blind these favors, or cutting them any slack at all,” she said.
Ashley Kilp, a junior science and humanities scholar,  leader of UFS’s Global Impact Corps, and campus representative for international UFS volunteers, traveled abroad to India last summer and spoke highly of the experience that Campbell is about to have. “We ran clinic camps in city slums and rural villages where we would screen over a hundred people a day for various eye problems; some we were able to fix with a free pair of glasses, but others required more serious treatment,” Kilp said.
“We brought those in need of further care back to the clinic to receive treatment. I even got to scrub in on their cataract surgeries.”
Kilp spoke of the joy she felt when seeing peoples’ faces light up when they could see for the first time with the distribution of a new pair of glasses, or with the removal of the bandage from a cataract removal.
“The people were so grateful that they often provided lunch for us,” Kilp said. 
“In a clearly destitute seaside village, the people who likely were struggling daily to feed themselves gave us a meal of rice and fish curry. Knowing what they had to sacrifice to show their thanks to us in that way made that the best meal of the trip for me,” Kilp said.
Upon return from her trip, Kilp became the campus representative for the international volunteering portion of UFS, providing information on opportunities to students and assisting in pre-departure advising. 
Kilp also started Global Health Corps, chartered by the national organization, which holds fundraising efforts for the UFS eye clinics abroad. 
Global Health Corps is new this year; despite having only a few members and currently without CoSO (the Committee on Student Organizations) recognition, it is hoping to grow.
Kilp enjoyed her experience so much that she plans to continue her international service. She is going to study abroad again, traveling to Ghana, where she will do much of the same work and also assist on a research project exploring the factors affecting high rates of preventable blindness.

Junior electrical and computer engineering student Ross Finman was awarded the Robert H. Goddard Memorial Scholarship, a scholarship issued by the National Space Club that is given to a student interested in space-related science and engineering.
When awarding the scholarship, the National Space Club looks for applicants whose academic plans involve future involvement in some type of aerospace engineering or technology, and who have past research or participation in aerospace related engineering, according to the club’s website. The scholarship is in memory of Robert H. Goddard, who NASA has dubbed “the father of modern rocket propulsion.”
“I was honored to have been given such a prestigious award. Being that it is a national competition, I was so thrilled that I was chosen,” said Finman.
Finman explained that he had been interested in space technology since he was 12 years old and received his first Lego Mindstorms kit, which he used to build robots until his fingers bled. He worked on various robotics projects after that, but he became even more interested when the Mars rovers landed.
“I read every story on the rovers for four years after they landed,” said Finman.
Finman is involved in a number of activities that go along with his interests in space technology. He has participated in the Google Lunar X-Prize, which is a $20 million competition where teams compete to send a robot to the moon and send images of the moon back to Earth, and is also working on the NASA Regolith Excavation challenge dealing with obtaining dirt from the moon.
“The Google Lunar X-Prize team has taught me more in two years than I could have imagined in my entire educational career,” Finman said.
He also received a SURG grant sponsored by Lockheed Martin to work on “tweels,” which are wheels that mimic normal tires but without the pressurization or materials that do not work properly in space.
Finman attributes many of his opportunities and successes in his academic career to Carnegie Mellon.
“Carnegie Mellon has been a major influence in my career and has offered me more opportunities to pursue robotics and engineering projects that I wouldn’t have been able to find elsewhere,” he said.
Finman also credits his professors and fellow students with helping him achieve what he has.
“Red Whittaker has been an excellent professor, and I know without his guidance I would not have been in a position to win this award. I am surrounded by a group of driven individuals who continue to help me expand my horizons,” Finman said.
ECE students and faculty also appreciate Finman’s work and successes at Carnegie Mellon just as much as Finman appreciates their help.
“Ross Finman is the kind of student that chooses Carnegie Mellon because our environment nurtures and inspires innovation,” explained Ed Schlesinger, head of the electrical and computer engineering department, in a Carnegie Mellon press release.
And it is not only the ECE department that promotes this environment of innovation.
“My professors consistently tie theoretical information back to practical applications and connect general ideas with current engineering issues. They want us to be aware of what is going on in engineering outside of Carnegie Mellon, and encourage us to think with a real-world mindset,” said Abby Morrell, a senior mechanical engineering major.
Professor William “Red” Whittaker, who heads Carnegie Mellon’s Lunar X-Prize team, also had the opportunity to work with Finman and also believes him to be deserving of the award.
“I could not think of a more deserving awardee. Ross is a jewel. He drives himself to lead and pulls his team along with him,” stated Whittaker in the press release.
Finman is very thankful for the opportunities he has experienced at Carnegie Mellon.
“I would like to thank the inspirational people at the Robotics Institute who have been so supportive of my efforts. I am surrounded by a group of driven individuals who continue to help me expand my horizons,” Finman commented.
The scholarship, which is $10,000 in value, will be presented to Finman on April 17 at the 52nd annual Goddard Memorial Dinner in Washington, D.C.

Not all hybrids are created equal, reported a team of Carnegie Mellon researchers upon testing the efficiency of large- and small-capacity battery packs used to operate plug-in hybrid vehicles. An electric vehicle with a large, heavy battery pack will require 10 percent more energy per mile than a similar vehicle with a smaller battery pack.
“We wanted to find out if the reduced vehicle efficiency caused by the additional weight of the heavy batteries used to store electrical energy in a PHEV [plug-in hybrid electric vehicle] would be significant,” said Jeremy Michalek, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering and leader of the research team. “We knew others were ignoring this, and we knew as mechanical engineers that extra mass causes extra losses. We wanted to see if the effect was enough to matter.”
The other members of the team were Carnegie Mellon researchers Constantine Samaras and C.S. Norman Shiau. The research was funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation.
Michalek believes the results of the study will have implications for automakers, consumers, and policymakers. Once the technology is cost-effective, it will become more mainstream, drastically increasing its impact. Small-capacity PHEVs may prove to be ideal for commuters, enabling them to save money while reducing oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. 
This is hardly a niche market — studies show that more than 50 percent of car owners drive less than 20 miles a day, according to a Feb. 26 press release issued by Carnegie Mellon’s Design Decisions Laboratory. 
In addition, such use may increase the demand for these vehicles among all consumers and lead to technological advances that could make larger-capacity PHEVs more competitive in the future.
“There are reasons we may still want to pursue the larger capacity plug-in vehicles in parallel, but when setting policy, I don’t think we should ignore the potential of the small-capacity plug-ins for building a market now,” Michalek said.
One large-capacity PHEV on the market today is GM’s Chevy Volt, with a battery pack that could accommodate an estimated 40 miles of travel. Small-capacity PHEVs, such as GM’s Saturn VUE or the PHEV version of the Toyota Prius, are sized for saven miles and 10–12 miles worth of batteries, respectively.
The battery of a small-capacity PHEV costs around $3000; the battery of a large-capacity PHEV costs close to $16,000. In comparison, the cost of the battery of a conventional Toyota Prius is $1300. 
While switching from a Prius to a small-capacity PHEV will cost the consumer $1700, Michalek estimates that the car owner will save about $5400 in fuel costs alone over a 150,000-mile lifespan, which more than makes up for the $1700 premium.
However, switching to a large-capacity PHEV from a Prius will cost the consumer $14,700. 
While the owner will save $5100 in fuel costs, it’s not enough to cover the $14,700 premium. In other words, large-capacity PHEV owners will lose $9600, while small-capacity PHEV owners will actually make $3700.
The results of the study may help achieve President Barack  Obama’s goal of having a million electric cars on the roads by 2012.
However, some Carnegie Mellon students remain skeptical of the benefits of electric vehicles.
“Hybrid-electric cars can be seen as a part of the solution to reducing carbon emissions, and saving money, but we have to remember that a car economy like the one we’ve enjoyed for the last century will not reduce emissions that much,” said Austin Redwood, a junior art and creative writing major and president of the student environmental organization Sustainable Earth. “We’ll still be using coal to power the cars and nickel for the batteries — two resources that need to be mined, then shipped all over the world for manufacture and distribution,” Redwood said. “If we don’t focus on conservation and reduction, hybrid-electric could only shift a lot of those emissions to the extraction of other natural resources, creating similar problems in supply/demand cycles, surplus, and scarce resources.”
Julia Kennedy, a junior art major, and Nathan Frank, a junior business major, expressed similar sentiments. 
“Although my father owns a hybrid car, I have heard that they are no more energy efficient than regular vehicles because of the number of batteries you need to replace during their life cycle,” Kennedy said.
“Hybrid-electric cars are good, but I don’t think they are the best option for alternative automotive fuel sources,” Frank said. “Government funds should go towards the most efficient option in my opinion: Hydrogen cars that exhaust water. This is a better use of research money.” 
Sean McMillan, a junior policy and management major, disagreed.
“I think beyond the environmental benefits, electric cars are just dope. I felt like Buzz Lightyear when I rode in a Prius,” he said.
But the work’s not over yet.
“We are continuing to work on a range of issues associated with economic and environmental impact of alternative transportation and the influence of technical tradeoffs, market forces, and public policy in determining the direction we go,” Michalek said.

Walk, don’t run, when crossing the street at Forbes and Morewood Avenues — and only if the white hand says go. Otherwise, you may be looking at citations or fines from Carnegie Mellon Police. Last Wednesday, Carnegie Mellon Police, along with University of Pittsburgh Police, City of Pittsburgh Police, and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, conducted a Motorist and Pedestrian Safety Enforcement Program in an effort to educate students, faculty, and residents of surrounding areas about pedestrian and vehicular safety.
The program, according to Carnegie Mellon’s 8½ x 11 Newsletter, was conducted by marked and unmarked police vehicles at intersections along Forbes Avenue and on surrounding streets. Any pedestrians or drivers caught disobeying traffic laws were issued a warning, including those who did not wait for a walk signal or who crossed streets at places that did not have crosswalks. Students were also warned that in the future, fines for traffic violations could be issued.
Driver and pedestrian safety is not a new topic to Carnegie Mellon — in 2007, history and policy Professor Joel Tarr researched pedestrian behavior around Carnegie Mellon’s campus and in parts of Downtown. He found that Forbes and Morewood was one of six potentially high-risk intersections in Pittsburgh that were recommended for safety improvements. Jared Itkowitz and Pooja Godbole, student body president and vice president, respectively, have also focused on safety initiatives during their time in office.
This program takes the findings from the research and makes a direct attempt to improve safety conditions for pedestrians and drivers on campus. 
Student reaction to the safety program, however, was mixed.
Many drivers were in favor of the program, citing many unsafe pedestrians who make driving around Carnegie Mellon more difficult.
“Students who cross the streets when they shouldn’t make it a lot harder to drive around campus, especially at night. People dart into the intersection quickly, and it’s really hard to see them. You have to be really alert,” said senior mechanical engineering major Lauren Eisenmenger.
Many pedestrians, however, do not believe that the program will be beneficial.
“Sometimes, I need to go to class, and waiting for a walk signal when there are absolutely no cars around seems pointless,” said junior economics and mathematics major Aneesha Deshpande.
Regardless of student opinion on the program, only time will tell if it is able to increase safety levels for drivers and pedestrians on campus on campus and in surrounding areas.

Carnegie Mellon is one of the first schools to be selected to be a part of an online collaborative learning network called GradeGuru. Developed as an extension of the McGraw-Hill Company, GradeGuru is an online note-sharing site allowing students to expand their knowledge in a collaborative environment.
GradeGuru was recently developed, and Carnegie Mellon was selected alongside other highly accredited universities to set the bar for the academic excellence encouraged by the GradeGuru network. Along with Carnegie Mellon, schools like Yale, Duke, and the University of Pennsylvania are target schools for the site because of the caliber of undergraduate students.
As a recent start-up, GradeGuru’s current focus is on collecting notes and rewarding its contributors with money for their notes to lay the foundation for their vision of a web 2.0 version of a study group — a collaborative learning experience online.
The website allows students to upload study materials and notes to receive cash, gift cards, and feedback. In turn, students looking for inspiration or help in their coursework can search for relevant study notes for specific courses and download them for free. Students who contribute to the site receive payment based on a points system: Points are determined by an algorithm that incorporates quantity, but more importantly quality, of each contributor’s notes and study materials.
GradeGuru is based on concepts similar to other note-sharing websites, such as Knetwit.com, but the McGraw-Hill sponsorship contributes some unique features of the site. According to Carnegie Mellon student Aleksey Tigay, a junior in business administration and GradeGuru representative, “GradeGuru provides more ways to search and look up notes. It also places an emphasis on quality of notes so students know that they information they are receiving is going to be beneficial.”
A quality that separates GradeGuru from similar sites is its partnership with TurnItIn.com, a plagiarism prevention service. The GradeGuru site promises to provide students with an “ethically sound platform for collaborative learning.”
While many students find note-sharing sites extremely useful, others are a bit more skeptical about their legitimacy. When asked about whether she would use a website like GradeGuru, first-year economics student Nicole Bayley said, “Probably not; I’m a pretty independent worker and I generally rely on my own notes. If I need help [from] someone, I would probably ask a friend or a professor instead of looking online. I guess I might use it if I have no other options.”
Laurence Ales, an economics professor, believes “there is a potential risk on spending time on material that is not 100 percent related to the course. There are already many resources that students have available: If they have questions the should simply come to office hours or send questions to their professors.”
In order to assuage many students’ fears about registering for any new sites, GradeGuru developer Emily Sawtell said, “Students do not have to pay to use GradeGuru, unlike some other study-help and notes-sharing sites. In fact, you do not even have to register before you get a sense for the site — you can check out 10 notes first and decide whether GradeGuru is for you. GradeGuru was the first notes sharing site to offer ‘try before you buy’ — we think it is such a compelling value proposition that once students see what is available, they will register and start contributing too.”
GradeGuru is currently providing additional incentive for students to upload notes to their site. In cooperation with McGraw-Hill, GradeGuru is offering a $1500 scholarship to the student who receives the most points this semester. If $1500 isn’t enough motivation for some students, Sawtell believes that the scholarship will provide academic recognition and “will look great on the winner’s résumé too.”
While GradeGuru is still a relatively new site, they will soon allow students to search for notes based on certain textbooks, a new blog allowing students to share any academic news, and a faster and further improved search function.
For more information about GradeGuru, visit their site at www.gradeguru.com.

Upper Management  at Miller Gallery
Carnegie Mellon’s 2009 Master of Fine Arts thesis exhibition, Upper Management, will be on view from March 20 through April 18 at the Miller Gallery. 
The five MFA candidates featured in the exhibition are Jennifer Gooch, Joseph Hays, Samina Mansuri, Michael Nixon, and Gregory Witt.
“If you have any interest in contemporary art, then this exhibition is a must- see,” said John Carson, head of Carnegie Mellon’s School of Art.
Gooch seeks to find simple solutions to enormous problems through her work, bringing “what-ifs” to fruition and treading the territory between the private and the public.
Hays builds participatory public works that integrate natural systems into the built environment and promote ecologically productive and cost-effective urban renewal.
Mansuri investigates the concepts of place, memory, and trauma by appropriating media depictions of war-torn areas, such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, Palestine, and Iraq, and by fabricating aerial views of fictional sites.
Nixon represents the spirit of Pittsburgh through poetic, abstract photography that highlights the urban, post-industrial landscape.
Witt creates mechanical and digital machines of familiar subjects that combine carpentry, robotics, and video.

iTunes users may not be pleased to learn of the new pricing policy that may cost customers more. The now-universal price of 99 cents per track will be replaced with the prices of 69 cents, 99 cents, and $1.29. Songs by artists with greater popularity will end up costing more, meaning consumers who do not pirate music and purchase it legally may end up paying more for popular songs. This could increase the level of piracy, as some users may no longer be willing to purchase music legally at an increased price.
Here are some statistics about music piracy:
Dollars the economy loses annually due to global music piracy: 12.5 billion
United States jobs lost due to piracy: 12,060
Dollars of personal income tax lost: 291 million
Dollars lost in tax revenue: 422 million
Dollars lost in corporate income and production taxes: 131 million

I feel the need to take this space this week to point something out to you, something that I thought was fairly obvious, but, apparently, is not: Sugar is not healthy.
To avoid sounding like a complete hypocrite, I need to admit a few things. I love Pixy Stix; I dump about six sugars into every cup of coffee that I drink, regardless of size; and I think that I could live on Nutella alone. Yes, I do realize that my teeth are probably rotting away as you read this; no, I don’t particularly care, because the taste more than makes up for it, and I have standing six-month appointments at my dentist. However, while I’m eating these sugary sweet foods, I’m not telling myself that I’m eating a particularly healthy snack.
Last year, high fructose corn syrup was the big food fad — you may recall the (crazy) commercials that attempted to promote it as healthy. Whether you loved them or hated them, they definitely got high fructose corn syrup’s name out there everywhere, and I do mean everywhere. I couldn’t watch any TV station for more than five minutes without seeing one of the terribly scripted and terribly acted commercials.
This year, however, sugar is the new high fructose corn syrup. People are starting to switch from purchasing foods and drinks with high fructose corn syrup to those with sugar, believing it to be the “healthier” choice of the two options. Unfortunately, these people are sadly mistaken.
This is not to say that I believe high fructose corn syrup is healthy. A few months ago, I wrote an article criticizing the high fructose corn syrup commercials — really, you feel the need for commercials to promote a sugar substitute? Really, you want to make Americans the object of ridicule around the world for yet another reason? And I stand by what I said in the article; high fructose corn syrup is not and never will be healthy, and we do not need commercials to promote unhealthy eating. However, when I wrote this, I was not trying to imply that it was healthier to eat sugar instead; rather, I meant that both were unhealthy.
Unfortunately, people have become very confused. In today’s world, “natural” is associated with “healthy,” and that’s exactly what sugar is being promoted as — natural (even though most sugar found in every day foods is actually refined, and thus not natural). Thus, people are associating sugar with healthy, an association that I did not think that I would ever hear.  And yes, sugar is healthy in moderation. If you think back to your elementary school days, and the food pyramid (the original one, not the new-and-improved one that I can’t understand), you’ll recall that sugar, along with fats and oils, was at the top of the triangle, showing that yes, these things are part of your daily diet, but healthy only when eaten sparingly.
What many people don’t realize is that while research is still ongoing, recent studies have shown that sugar and high fructose corn syrup are equally healthy, or, if you will, equally unhealthy. And yet, some are trying to blame high fructose corn syrup for increasing obesity rates. Rather than blaming high fructose corn syrup, though, I think the answer lies in the appalling number of pounds of sugar and high fructose corn syrup that Americans eat per year — 44 and 40, respectively, which are ridiculously high numbers.
But people will not be looking to these numbers for the answers to their food- and health-related problems. In America, food, just like so many other things, is a fad. A few years ago, the Atkins diet was all the rage, and now you hear almost nothing about it. Instead, eating natural and organic foods is the cool thing to do. And eating sugar fits right into this — it’s the most natural of all the sweetening options, thus, it’s popular. And things that are popular often turn into things that are healthy in the common perception.
Obviously, I’m not trying to completely eradicate sugar from people’s diets, as that’s not even reasonable. I would be very unhappy drinking black coffee and eating unsweetened foods, and some sugar is healthy for you. But people need to realize that just because sugar is less processed than high fructose corn syrup does not mean it’s healthy. People need to stop getting caught up in the food fads that begin and end faster than your four years in college and instead take a look at the nutrition facts on the back of food packages. If you’re really interested in eating healthy, you’ll learn more there than you ever will from any commercial or gossip about a certain product.
Heather Tomko (htomko@) is never going to give up her Nutella or her sweetened-with-six-sugars coffee.

Bravely overcoming hurdles that disrupted their “Long March,” Pakistani lawyers were not only successful in forcing President Asif Ali Zardari to fulfill his promise of restoring the judiciary, but also managed to earn Pakistan a commendable reason to be in the headlines.
Earlier this month, a stream of lawyers, activists, and students marched across the country demanding the reinstatement of Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry and the 60 judges who had been sacked by former President Pervez Musharraf. To prevent them from challenging the legitimacy of his re-election, the so-called “democratic” government of Pakistan attempted to suppress the movement by mobilizing an otherwise apathetic police force and blocking its advancement with enormous shipping containers.
Images of elderly men and women literally being tossed into police vans splashed across national television. Both inside and outside Pakistan, many view this restoration of an independent judiciary as a critical first step toward Pakistani democracy. Undoubtedly, the people of Pakistan made history by overturning an unconstitutional decision.
Reaping the imagined fruits of this victory, the masses feel empowered, and once again, Pakistanis all across the world are citing the “power of the people” in the war-torn nation. As a Pakistani, I too took pleasure for a while in exploring this beautiful mirage known as “the power of the citizens,” which is a rare sight in Pakistan today. It was refreshing to see that change had occurred in Pakistan not because of U.S. intimidation, but because of the positive will of educated citizens. However, despite my pride and patriotism, I could only avoid the facts and entertain this fantasy for so long.
Besides Pakistan remaining a lawless state buckling under the irrational decisions of its government and the Pakistani Taliban, a major consequence could have arisen from Zardari’s refusal to reinstate the rule of law — and it has nothing to do with the persistence of the “people.” It has very much to do with continued U.S. backing of Zardari, as well as the $1.5 billion in non-military aid from the U.S. (the first influx of a total of $7.5 billion over five years) that has just poured into Pakistan.
Political analysts had already begun suggesting that Zardari was deliberately dodging the restoration of the Chief Justice, since it would unearth the issue of an amnesty provided to Zardari by Musharraf that immunizes him against charges of massive corruption. An independent judiciary may also call into question the president’s day-to-day actions, sapping away a large chunk of his unlimited powers. Zardari’s aides already claim that the president has an “image problem.”
This kind of publicity could not have helped, yet it did not deter Zardari. On the other hand, the leader of the opposition party, Pakistan Muslim League (N), Nawaz Sharif, alleged that the Supreme Court, under Zardari’s orders, stopped Sharif from assuming public office while it deposed his brother Shahbaz Sharif from the position of Chief Minister of Punjab, the second largest province in Pakistan. To defy the criminal and corruption charges against him, Sharif was joined in leading the mass lawyers’ movement that, if successful, would to a large extent nullify all allegations against him. The government placed Sharif under house arrest during the long march, causing his supporters to lead a fueled rally of their own. That is when the riots caught flame.
This kind of anarchy and instability in the region was more bothersome to the U.S. than to the leadership of Pakistan. The reason is simple: The U.S. cannot afford to see the current leadership in Pakistan fall to pieces because such an incident would destabilize the U.S. operation in Afghanistan, as well as hinder the “war on terror,” now resurrected under President Barack Obama as the “overseas contingency operation.”
Furthermore, “told-you-so” sighs from the Indian media, which is committed to endlessly victimizing the nation at the hands of its struggling neighbor, did not fall on deaf ears. The Bharatya Janta Party (BJP) has not restrained from cautioning the U.S., as it provides aid to Pakistan. With opposition for U.S. support of Pakistan soaring in India, a potentially important ally, the U.S. cannot be seen backing an ineffective government.
So when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reportedly threatened to revoke the U.S.’s promise of providing Pakistan a total of $7.5 billion in non-military aid, Zardari was left with little choice.
It is interesting that Clinton has suddenly begin to consider herself an authority on the country, because until last year, she did not have a clue about the election process in Pakistan and believed that if Musharraf was running in elections for the parliament, he must do so according to the same rules followed by all the other candidates, while in reality Musharraf had already elected himself for the next five years.
Moreover, she took the liberty to dictate the course of internal affairs in a country where the U.S., hypothetically, is supposed to foster democracy. Assisting her was the British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, David Miliband. How ironic, then, that the U.S. must feel the need to repeatedly adopt a bullying strategy toward Pakistan, and include its former colonizer Britain in the game, in order to secure its own interests.
It comes as no surprise that shortly after announcing the hefty aid package, Obama also laid out his new strategy for Pakistan and Afghanistan. Once again, Pakistan has been paid to compromise its sovereignty and open up its borders to U.S. foreign policy that may not be in the best interest of the people. By means of economic intervention, we have flashed a green signal for complete political and military intervention and established a sense of servitude to flawed U.S. foreign policy.

Those who are close to student government know that, while the student body president and vice president get more press, the power behind the throne is the vice president for finance. The SBVPF, who chairs the Joint Funding Committee, is the loudest voice in a process that annually doles out over a million dollars in funding to student organizations that eventually turns into concerts, newspapers, and thousands of dumplings.
While I am already tired of hearing about how the economic downturn is going to affect Carnegie Mellon, it is nonetheless true that the JFC is facing an uncertain school year in 2009–2010. In addition to an increased reliance on the JFC as internal and external funding sources continue to dry up, rumblings of a substantial increase in the student activities fee will likely result in a lot of hand-wringing and gnashing of teeth in the fall semester.
To oversee this contentious year, Carnegie Mellon’s student body — all of whom are affected by the SBVPF’s decisions — deserves an experienced and knowledgeable vice president for finance. That person is Nara Kasbergen.
Kasbergen is a three-year veteran of the JFC, but just as important as that, her involvement in student organizations shows unmatched breadth and depth. She has spent at least a semester in nearly a half-dozen student organizations, developing deep commitments to Student Senate and the multicultural group Awareness of Roots in Chinese Culture.
The ability to understand the needs of diverse organizations is a rarity on a campus where students tend toward specialization. This broad student organization experience will be of undoubted benefit to both the JFC and, by extension, student organizations who count on the JFC to remain knowledgeable on the issues that concern them.
My first-hand experiences with Nara on the JFC have shown me that she is not only committed to the funding process, but is also a strong advocate of the groups that she represents. She is eager to attend their events and meetings in order to come to a better understanding of the groups’ needs. This has resulted, for the most part, in leaner, more efficient budgeting within her groups. I am hopeful that she would inspire this example in the other members of the committee.
The commitment to due diligence that she has shown is especially important to me with the specter of an increase to the student activities fee looming on the not-so-distant horizon. I have said repeatedly that a substantial increase in the fee should not even be considered without a very deliberate re-evaluation of both the JFC process and the Student Activities accounting process. If there is anyone who understands the process enough to shape it up for potential increases to the student activities fee, it is Nara.
Though I have spoken mainly about the SBVPF as a leader on the JFC, the role is much more. The SBVPF functions as the main financial adviser to the student body president, and also advises the dean of Student Affairs and President Cohon on financial matters concerning students. I am confident that Nara will be prepared to deliver sound advice that is honest and straightforward. On top of these responsibilities, her platform indicates that she would like to grow the role of SBVPF even further, to increase its responsibilities. She understands that there is a dearth of quality financial advising for student organizations and has plans to fill it.
Still, Nara will face many challenges. She will represent both undergraduates and graduate students, and while her undergraduate experiences are broad, connecting with graduate students is a notoriously difficult task. While it is unlikely that Nara will have time to complete all of the 37 objectives she has set for herself in her platform, that fact there are 37 well-articulated points categorized under five objectives shows the ability to critically analyze the current process, plan for a new direction, and show how she is going to get there. On March 29, my vote will be with Nara.

Last week, the issue of drug searches in high schools — and what exactly constitutes a proper, reasonable procedure for them — was brought into the public spotlight when the date for the Supreme Court case against an Arizona high school was announced.
In 2003, Safford Unified School District, located in Safford, Ariz., conducted a strip search of a 13-year-old eighth-grade girl suspected of having prescription-strength ibuprofen, which is roughly twice as strong as the over-the-counter variety. While the strip search was performed by two female faculty members, including the school nurse, school officials never asked the girl whether she had the pills with her (she didn’t), and they had no reason to believe that she did, except for the word of a student who had already been caught with pills in her possession.
This particular case presents problems that a usual drug search does not. First, there was no attempt to get a confession out of the girl before subjecting her to the search; furthermore, there was no evidence suggesting she might be carrying the drugs except another student’s word. With this lack of evidence and immediate jump to what should have been a worst-case-scenario, last-resort procedure, the school district and its administration should be reprimanded for its decision to conduct the search.
In addition, the district had reason to believe only that she carried prescription ibuprofen, which, while admittedly stronger than the over-the-counter variety, is nowhere near hard-core drug status. For a drug that so closely resembles an over-the-counter painkiller, a strip search was unreasonable. This kind of excessive search is protected against by the fourth amendment to the U.S. Constitution — a fact that has been considered by Appeals Court judges in their opinions.
While we understand that many schools have implemented zero-tolerance drug policies that they must stand by, we believe that strip searches are unnecessary and unreasonable. For minors who are accused of carrying drugs, strip searches are excessive and violate students’ individual rights. Schools need to devise better methods for keeping drugs out of their campuses that do not involve an unnecessary violation of rights and privacy.

I am writing to express my disappointment with your March 23 article, “Lack of publicity for elections disappointing.” While I agree that there has thus far been a surprising lack of traditional campaigning, it is surely too soon to judge the impact of their campaigns on the student body. The same might be said for your analysis of Elections Board marketing strategies: There is more to come.
But my main concern is your lack of understanding regarding the constraints that are in place for the Elections Board, and the role we are asked to play.
You may remember — or have heard the legend of — the year the student body elections “broke” (2007). In response, the rules governing student body elections were revised, and the 2008 Elections Board was charged with strict adherence to the new rules. The aim, in part, was to promote a new culture of respect for the procedures that are in place to guide student government.
While you would like to see posters littering the walls of every building on campus, both candidates and the Elections Board are expected to adhere to campus postering and graffiti policies — which restrict our advertising to one poster per bulletin board.
Consider also the following: Last year there were contests for Senate seats in five of the seven colleges; this year there are three. Last year all of our publicity hit campus after spring break; this year we collected petitions from candidates before spring break and restarted our publicity afterward. Last year everyone was waiting to see whether the election would be once again spectacular; this year we have returned to a slightly less exciting atmosphere.
In short, there are a variety of factors that affect student body election publicity and how it is perceived. Next time you want to express your disappointment, please take the time to consider the whole story, instead of just fanning the flame of misguided perception.
Ruth Poproski, Elections Board Co-Chair

Hey Tartans,
Loop There It Is! The Loop Bus was highly successful in its first weekend, with nearly 100 riders on Friday night. Pooja and I will make sure to keep you up to date on the progress of the initiative.
This week, I want to encourage all of you to vote. Elections for next year’s student body president and vice president are happening today through Tuesday at 6 p.m. at cmu.edu/studentvote. Make sure to visit the elections website and read through the candidates’ platforms before making your decision.
Although I’ve been fairly reserved throughout this campaign process, I am excited about the SBP/SBVP candidates.
Rotimi Abimbola is the most experienced candidate and it shows. Her campaign deals largely with student government initiatives that are relevant and thoughtful. Although I wish that she had better highlighted the “CMU Experience” section of her platform, her candidacy is promising. Abimbola’s message that now is the time for experience seems to be a good one. Although I wish I knew more about her running mate, Adam Klein, he does seem to bring a complementary role to Abimbola’s “burden” of too much experience.
While neither Sarah Sheikh nor Jonathan Hall has had direct student government experience, I’m confident that they would get things done. Addressing the economy in their platform counted for major bonus points for me, as I think that will be the largest concern facing student government next year. I was also duly impressed with their extensive office hours in the library — no better way to be transparent and visible than actually doing it. While I wish student government issues were better outlined in their platform, I like having a fresh perspective in this race and think that their initiatives might be the most uniquely defined.
Although they may not have the most student government experience, the most experience in understanding the student voice has to be Damian Valdes and Risa Masuda. Both are highly involved on campus and seem to be the most connected. While some fear that they may be spread too thin, I’ve seen both Valdes and Masuda balance a million things. I like their energy — and while screaming in front of Doherty Hall may seem over the top, it shows me how much they want this. I see them as the type of successors that can build on the initiatives that Pooja and I started.
No matter who you choose, I’m confident that the next SBP/SBVP candidate will bring a positive impact to student government and your experience on campus. So now GO VOTE!

I am writing in response to the March 23 article "Professor prevents AIDS through needle exchange." As an alumnus and physician specializing in infectious diseases, I am proud that Carnegie Mellon University has the privilege to call Professor Caroline Acker one of its faculty. Professor Acker's efforts in the arena of harm-reduction (i.e. needle exchange, Narcan prescribing) with injection drug use are heroic and courageous. In a world in which billions of dollars are spent on an illogical "War on Drugs," Professor Acker stands as an exemplar of what is possible if reason and logic are applied to a societal problem.
