Junior tennis player Yuvraj Kumar has come a long way from his beginnings as a player, both figuratively and literally. 
The decision science and policy management major from New Delhi, India is a force to be reckoned with both on and off the courts.
Kumar first became interested in tennis when he was around five years old. “My dad used to play competitively, so his drive sort of passed down onto me,” Kumar said. 
While he played a variety of sports — including cricket, basketball, and soccer — tennis was the sport he went into with a competitive mindset. 
His prowess with the sport only grew with time, taking him to competitions around and outside of the country. 
His proudest moment during this time came when he participated in the Junior Asia Cup as a member of the Indian men’s team.
When the time came to choose a school, he said he wanted a place where he was more than just an athlete: “Academics were in the backseat when I was younger, but they became very important to me by the time I got older.”
Kumar knew he wanted to go to school in the U.S., but he didn’t know exactly where. 
Kumar looked at various Division I schools but quickly decided that they would be too one-sided. 
As he expanded his search, he found in Carnegie Mellon a place where he believed he could get a multi-dimensional experience. 
He welcomed the opportunity for rigorous academic challenges, a motivated team atmosphere, and a wealth of extracurricular activities.
Kumar started playing with the tennis team a week after stepping on campus for the first time as a freshman. 
He remembered how thrilling winning his first big match against Amherst College was. “From the start, we were a tight-knit team,” Kumar said.
From then on, he found himself improving in both singles and in doubles. His current singles record of 20-13 is only getting better, and his doubles record stands at 23-16. His chemistry with his teammates has grown considerably. 
“The team has gotten a lot more dedicated, driven, and passionate,” Kumar said, citing the strong team-oriented focus all the members have.
He has done particularly well with senior mechanical and biomedical engineering major Bryce Beisswanger; they earned spots on the All-UAA Second Team for the 2012-2013 year and were ranked eighth regionally in doubles for the 2013-2014 year.
Off the courts, Kumar has dedicated time for both the full Carnegie Mellon academic workload and various other commitments.
He is a proud member of Sigma Phi Epsilon, and he’s spent a good amount of time involved in the Lunar Gala. “I just wanted to embrace the full college experience,” he said. 
He believes that coming to Carnegie Mellon has been one of the best decisions he has made, considering it to be a great privilege to be at a renowned university with so many dedicated people.
Even though he still has a good amount of time left at Carnegie Mellon, Kumar has already set his eyes towards the future.
He wants to work in the finance industry to gain corporate experience. 
Afterwards, he wants to be able to start and run his own company, a dream that is coming closer to becoming a reality with each passing day. 
However, he certainly won’t let his professional dreams keep him away from his favorite sport. “Tennis will be a part of my life no matter where I go.”

This has been a bizarre season for the Pittsburgh Penguins. 
Starting with the mumps outbreak in December that sidelined captain Sidney Crosby, forwards Beau Bennett and Steve Downie, defensemen Olli Maata and backup goalie Thomas Greiss, the Penguins have had an unusual season even for their standards. 
Crosby and assistant captain Evgeni Malkin have been relatively healthy compared to their prolonged absences in the previous few seasons, top goalkeeper Marc-Andre Fleury is third in Goals Against Average, and for once the defense is outpacing the offense with Pittsburgh placing fifth in goals against average, versus ninth in goals for average.
All of this statistical success and health should be the indicator of a monstrous season for the Penguins, but yet the results have been decidedly subpar. 
At one point falling out of the guaranteed top three divisional playoff spots, Pittsburgh has been scrapping along in a Metropolitan division they were expected to put in their rear view mirror a long time ago. 
Thankfully, in a weak Eastern Conference, the Penguins would need a catastrophic collapse to miss the playoffs entirely, although a little stumble may be all that’s needed for the Washington Capitals to jump Pittsburgh in the standings and force the Penguins into a wild card slot. 
There are many teams in the NHL who would love to be sitting pretty in the playoff picture 75 percent through the season, but playoffs aren’t good enough for Pittsburgh. 
Since the beginning of the current era of Crosby and Malkin, the motto has been Stanley Cup or bust. 
And while there was one true success under the plan, that was over a half decade ago. 
There is a new coach and general manager after the string of early playoff exits, but the mindset is the same. 
At the trade deadline that comes to a close on Monday, the Penguins reprised in their role as aggressive buyers, this year picking up defensive forward Daniel Winnik from the Toronto Maple Leafs, winger David Perron from the Edmonton Oilers and center Max Lapierre from the St. Louis Blues. 
These acquisitions were mainly focused on the major glaring flaw that has faced Pittsburgh in playoffs the past few years, a lack of toughness and grit.
Hockey is fundamentally different from the rest of professional sports in its dramatic shift in play between the regular season and the playoffs. 
The Penguins have long thrived on the wide open play of the regular season, with the long quick passes, finesse and skill as they railroad their opponents, but come playoff time these passing lanes narrow and finesse and skills are replaced by strength and cross checking. 
In this new game paradigm, Pittsburgh has struggled, but its new moves, while done in the same aggressive fashion as previous years, have focused on reinforcing a different weakness.
Ultimately, for Penguins fans, the regular season may as well be the pre-season. Playoffs are the only thing that matters, and as such, much of these regular season stats and results must be taken with a grain of salt. 
Recent Pittsburgh history has taught us that regular season success is not a particularly good indicator of post-season victory. 
Maybe these additions will help the push the Penguins back over the hump, or maybe this will be another in the long string of early playoff exits.
The more things look different for Pittsburgh, the more they are the same, but only time can tell if these changes are superficial or meaningful. 
Either way, it’s time for Pittsburgh to get out of its winter hibernation and warm up for playoff hockey. 
Hopefully, it’ll be a nice long run into the warm summer months or fans will continue to be left out in the cold.

It has been over a week now since Thursday, Feb. 19, when 37 players and several draft picks were exchanged on one of NBA’s most exciting trade deadline days in recent memory. It took a while to comprehend the madness, but now that players have completed their moves and settled into their teams, we can begin to look at all the major trades and see how they panned out for all parties involved.
Portland Trailblazers acquire: forward/guard Arron Afflalo and forward/guard Alonzo Gee
Denver Nuggets acquire: forward Thomas Robinson, forward/guard Victor Claver, and guard Will Barton, a protected future first round pick, a protected future second round pick
This was probably the only trade of the day that actually affected a major contender. 
Portland got their much needed wing help with Afflalo. 
On paper this seems like a great move for Portland, considering the limited assets they gave up. 
Claver and Will “The People’s Champ” Barton were end of the bench wings who rarely ever saw game time, upstaged by the likes of guard Allen Crabbe. 
With the emergence of center Meyers Leonard this season and the signing of center Chris Kaman this offseason, Robinson was always expendable. 
The first round pick is probably going to land in the low 20s, provided the Blazers manage to keep their starting unit together this offseason. 
They probably should have made the same trade for Memphis Grizzlies forward Jeff Green instead though, given Afflalo’s lack of concern about defense and attitude issues he displayed recently in Denver.
On the flip side, this is a decent move for Denver, too. Afflalo was clearly being wasted there and they had excess wing depth anyway. 
Trading a veteran for a potentially useful pick in the future was a smart idea. 
They, however, waived Robinson, whose energy and hustle they could have used to give something for their fans to cheer this season. 
Besides, this is not a trade that is going to have a large effect on the direction of their franchise, so it made sense for everyone involved.
Detroit Pistons acquire: guard Reggie Jackson
Oklahoma City Thunder acquire: guard DJ Augustin, forward/guard Kyle Singler, forward Steve Novak, forward/center Enes Kanter
Utah Jazz acquire: center Kendrick Perkins and forward Grant Jerrett, a first round pick from OKC, a second round pick from DET, draft rights
The first blockbuster trade of the evening was a quite a win-win-win situation. 
The Thunder managed to get the biggest haul from this trade, as they turned an unhappy backup point guard and a washed up center (plus a first rounder) into two skilled shooters, one of the best backup PG’s in the league and a talented offensive center. 
In one trade nearly all their problems got solved as they now have a player (Augustin) who wants to backup Russell Westbrook, shooters to back up Kevin Durant (Singler and Novak) and a center to play next to Serge Ibaka who can actually get buckets.
The Pistons filled a huge void since the injury to guard Brandon Jennings, and managed to do it without surrendering any future assets. 
Stan Van Gundy is having a fantastic season at the helm as he retools his roster. 
What this means for their PG rotation in the future, though, remains to be seen.
Utah managed to get a first rounder for a player they considered expendable since the emergence of Rudy Gobert. 
However, their lack of offense from the front court could be an issue down the line.
Miami Heat acquire: guard Goran Dragic and evil twin Zoran Dragic
New Orleans Pelicans acquire: guard Norris Cole, forward Shawne Williams, Justin Hamilton
Phoenix Suns acquire: forward Danny Granger, forward/guard John Salmons, first round picks from Miami in 2017 and 2019
Miami definitely won this trade as they solved a problem in their rotation lingering from the James era by getting a quality point guard to run the show. 
They didn’t surrender any rotation players of note besides Cole, but those two first rounders could be an issue as their roster ages. 
They won’t be able to turn to the draft to infuse new talent. But the Bosh-Dragic pick-and-roll in the future makes for an exciting image.
The Pelicans  shed Salmons and added a legit rotation piece in Cole, a feisty defender and a decent point guard to back up guard Jrue Holiday.
Phoenix lost big in this trade as they lost one of their premier point guards for two picks and Granger. 
The former all-star is too washed up to contribute, unless their famed medical department manages to make a player out of him again. 
The first round picks could be valuable if they hit, or as trade chips if they manage to become  real contenders over the next couple of seasons. 
They could and probably should have tried to replace Dragic with a player who could contribute right away if they want to make the playoffs.
Milwaukee Bucks acquire: guard Michael Carter-Williams (MCW), guard Tyler Ennis, center Miles Plumlee
Philadelphia 76ers acquire: A top-five protected Lakers first round pick
Phoenix Suns acquire: guard Brandon Knight, guard Kendall Marshall, forward Marcus Thornton, a first round pick from Cleveland via Boston
Boston Celtics acquire: guard Isaiah Thomas
The most unexpected trade to go down on deadline day threw many surprises, beginning with the Bucks dealing Knight. 
Knight was having a career year, was nearly an all-star, and had led the surprising Bucks to 30 wins by the all-star break. 
Trading him at this juncture seemed to be an afterthought, but the reasons can be seen in the assets acquired and what it means for the Bucks future. Knight was the only hole in a stout Bucks defense, and MCW solves that problem. 
He was also prefers scoring to passing, which became an issue as the likes of forwards Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton did not get enough shots. 
MCW and Ennis are purer point guards and players who have the potential to excel defensively as well, with MCW’s length and Ennis’s quickness being important factors. 
Plus the coaching of Jason Kidd should help them develop as well and the Bucks don’t have to worry about overpaying Knight in the summer any more. Plumlee adds some much needed big man depth since center Larry Sanders got waived.
Many were surprised that the Sixers were willing to trade Carter-Williams in the first place, since the reigning rookie of the year was supposed to be an integral part of their future. But with a another top-five pick coming this year, which can easily pick Emmanuel Mudiay or D’Angelo Russell and the juicy Lakers pick, which could be top six this year or top five next year. 
MCW’s shooting issues and sometimes iffy decision-making probably played a part.
The Suns made a great decision by adding Knight to replace Dragic, and he is probably a better fit, given his penchant to score and not necessarily pass while also being good as an outside shooter. 
However, giving up Thomas to get a washed up Marcus Thornton doesn’t make sense unless they manage to pick a valuable point guard in this year’s draft or sign someone with the cap space they will now free up. 
This will give forward/guard T.J. Warren more game time, though, and his development could also be important.
The Celtics made a great move by getting something in return for Thorton’s salary and maybe a valuable bench point guard for the next few years. 
They did surrender a first rounder, but they have too many of those to worry about giving away one.
There were several other minor trades while the Wizards acquired Ramon Sessions and Philly got another first rounder to take on JaVale McGee. 
The Rockets also got in on the action by acquiring Pablo Prigioni from the Knicks and K.J. McDaniels from the Sixers. While there was no serious action by any of the top contenders (the Warriors, Hawks, Grizzlies, Cavs), this was still a day likely to have a huge implication on the future of the league and maybe some outcomes of this season

Swimming & Diving
On Saturday, sophomore Machika Kaku competed in the NCAA Zone 4 Regional in an effort to join many of her fellow Tartans at the NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships. Kaku placed fourth overall with a score of 398.60 in the one-meter dive. Her finish in the top seven guaranteed that she will compete at the national meet in Shenandoah, Texas March 18-21. 
Also competing for Carnegie Mellon will be senior Josh Lucheon, sophomore Sivan Mehta, and first-years Matthew Chu and Kevin Steinhouse for the men. They qualified in the 200-yard medley relay and will also compete together in the 400-yard medley and 200- and 400-yard freestyle relays. Individually, Mehta will compete in the 100-yard butterfly, Chu in 100-yard breaststroke and Steinhouse in the 50-yard freestyle. 
For the women, junior Kira Singhaus, sophomores Allison Kirkby and Gillian Crews, and first-year Kim Hochstedler were invited based on their 400-yard medley relay. As with the men, the four will also compete in the 200-yard medley, and 200- and 400-yard freestyle relays. Crews was also invited based on her 100-yard butterfly and will also compete in the 200-yard butterfly and 50-yard freestyle. Singhaus will compete in the 200-yard backstroke and Hochstedler will compete individually in the 100- and 200-yard breaststrokes.
Women’s Tennis
This weekend, the seventh ranked Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team traveled to DePauw University for the 2015 ITA National Team Indoor Championships. 
In the quarterfinals on Friday, the Tartans faced off against the 20th ranked Washington and Lee University. To start off the match, Carnegie Mellon took the quick 2-1 lead in doubles with sophomore Vanessa Pavia and first-year Stacy Chang winning 8-3, while senior Bryn Raschke and first-year Cori Sidell required a tiebreaker before finally pulling out the victory 9-8(8-6).
In singles play, the Tartans struggled a bit more and split the matches 3-3 but took the match 5-4 due to their earlier doubles victory. Pavia and sophomore Nicolle Torres each won in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2 and 7-5, 7-5 respectively, with the final victory coming from Raschke, who pulled out the three set victory 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 to put the Tartans in the semifinals. 
Saturday, Carnegie Mellon faced off against eighth ranked conference rival Washington University of St. Louis. Following the blueprint they set out against Washington and Lee, the Tartans took another quick 2-1 lead in doubles play with identical wins as before. Pavia and Chang won 8-3 again, while Raschke and Sidell needed a tiebreaker to win 9-8(8-6). 
Again following the Friday gameplan, the Tartans split singles play 3-3. Torres again won in straight sets, 6-4, 6-4 this time while junior Brooke Tsu took the other straight set victory for the Tartans 6-2, 6-1. Playing the role of final point, Chang won her match in three sets, 6-4, 6-7(1-7), 6-0 to push the Tartans into the final against fourth ranked Johns Hopkins University. The two teams had faced off in these finals the previous two years, with Johns Hopkins winning both. 
The Tartans looked like they were going to get the early edge in doubles with Sidell and Raschke winning 8-4 and Chang and Pavia up, but a comeback by Johns Hopkins to down Carnegie Mellon 7-9 and another loss left the Tartans in a 1-2 hole headed into singles play. There it also looked like the Tartans had a chance to retake the lead after senior Angela Pratt won her match in straight sets 6-4, 7-6, but Pavia and Torres both dropped their second sets and lost the tiebreakers to lose, 6-1, 1-6, 6-7 for Pavia and 6-4, 3-6, 6-7 for Torres. From there the Tartans couldn’t comeback dropping one more match before Johns Hopkins had it wrapped up for their third straight title defeat over Carnegie Mellon, 6-3 after a garbage time win by Raschke.
The Tartans next play on their spring break trip to California. 
Women’s Basketball
With the chance for a winning season on the line, the Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team faced off against Case Western Reserve University in their season finale on Saturday. 
Starting off cold, the Tartans quickly fell behind 13-0 before the offense clicked into gear by being more aggressive and drawing several fouls and getting into their rhythm from the charity stripe. Through the rest of the half, Carnegie Mellon and the Spartans played very evenly, but the early Case Western lead remained ever present with the Tartans going into half time down 31-40.
The start of the second half was the antithesis of the first for Carnegie Mellon as they came out hot and quickly cut the lead to two in just over three minutes. This burst of energy was just that though, a burst and the Tartans quickly fell behind by double digits again. Carnegie Mellon tried to mount a handful of comeback runs, but they were unable to string together enough defensive stops to cut the deficit in any meaningful way. Down the stretch, Case Western hit nearly all their free throws as the Tartans tried to stop the clock and quickly ballooned their lead to nearly 20 points before it settled at the final tally of 66-82.
While the season ended on a down note for the Tartans, sophomore Lisa Murphy has a lot to be proud of as she finished with 29 points in the game and became the second ever Tartans to average a double-double across an entire season with 20.2 points and 10.2 rebounds. 
The loss dropped the Tartans to 12-13 for the season and 3-11 in University Athletic Association (UAA) play. 
Men’s Basketball
In their season finale, the Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team wanted to finish on a high after already clinching their first winning season since 2009 the previous weekend. Facing UAA rival Case Western on Saturday, the Tartans put the cherry on top of their good season while setting up momentum for the future with an 82–71 victory over the Spartans.
The game started with a clear emphasis on defense as the opening minutes saw blocks by both teams and tough interior defense forcing several missed jump shots by both teams. A jump shot by senior Jasen Blakney exactly half way through the period tied the game up at 16 as the teams continued to battle back and forth. A pair of baskets by sophomore Chris Shkil followed by a successful shot and free throw by senior Seth Cordts gave the Tartans a lead they would never relinquish with just under 5 minutes to go in the first half. Carnegie Mellon went into half up 7, 35–28.
Out of the half, Case Western cut the lead back down to one in the opening minute before Cordts hit a quick layup and three pointer to give the Tartans back some breathing room. Both teams picked up their pace and their shooting percentages as the previously defensive game transformed into a shootout. Thankfully, the Tartans got to do most of their shooting from the free throw line as Case Western tried to mount a comeback, and were able to push their lead to double digits with the final set of free throws by Blakney to get the final score of 82–71.
The win makes the Tartans 14–11 for the season and 5–9 in UAA play. 
Track & Field
This weekend, the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track and field teams competed in the UAA Indoor Championship hosted by University of Chicago. Although both teams placed fifth in the field of seven, several individuals of both genders had outstanding days.
Senior Sasha Spalding had a busy weekend competing in several track and field events. In the 60-meter she placed third during prelims but fell to fifth during the finals heat. Spalding also competed in the 200-meter dash, where she finished fourth in the finals heat.
In the distance medley, the Carnegie Mellon A squad of senior Sara Kelly, first year Sarah Cook, sophomore Ariel Tian, and senior Erin Kiekhaefer placed fourth.
On the field side, sophomore Rebecca Fortner placed fourth for the Tartans in the high jump while Spalding placed second.
For the men, their distance domination continued with senior Thomas Vandenberg again winning the 800-meter run. Sophomore Owen Norley won the one-mile run and senior George Degen rounded out the success with second place in the 3000-meter run.
The Tartans also won the distance medley with junior Marc-Daniel Julien, sophomore Nathan Willis Vandenberg and Norley combining for a time of 10:06.75. The field events were tough for the Tartans with no top five finishes in any event for the men.
The next chance to compete for both teams will be the NCAA Indoor Championships on March 13 and 14, where some individuals may be invited based on their top times throughout the season.

This weekend, the Carnegie Mellon club ice hockey team competed in the College Hockey East open league championships.
In Friday’s semifinal, the Tartans took on the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg after coming into the post season as the last seed. After giving up an early goal, Carnegie Mellon made sure to keep the damage in check with a quick response less than a minute later by graduate student Garret Stack, with assists by sophomores John Bird and Connor Siwik. The rest of the first period was generally muted with only one late penalty for the Bobcats and no other scoring after the initial outburst.
The second period was a different story, with a series of penalties creating multiple power play opportunities for each side. Pitt-Greensburg capitalized first with a power play goal at the 12 minute mark, but the Tartans again responded quickly with an even strength goal by senior Justin Fischler. 
Siwik then gave Carnegie Mellon their first lead of the game a few minutes later, before a busted opportunity and short-handed goal by the Bobcats tied the game up at three going into the final period.
The third period had all the physicality of the second with the low scoring of the first. Although each team had some opportunities early on, the game changed with a slashing call on Fischler. 
This power play gave Pitt-Greensburg the opportunity to take the lead with less than four minutes to go. 
The Tartans fought off the play for over a minute and half, until the Bobcats got their opportunity and scored a hat trick for Pitt-Greensburg forward Nick Vecchio. As they had done all game, Carnegie Mellon responded swiftly and determinedly, with Stack scoring the tying goal off of an assist by junior Chad Trice with less than a minute left.
Overtime was heated, but the referees let the two teams play until Trice got a breakaway just past the 10-minute mark. 
Out of options and fearing the breakaway, the Bobcats pulled him down from behind, resulting in a penalty shot for Trice, who converted to send the Tartans into the finals 5–4. Aside from the clutch heroics by the Tartans, the most impressive performance was by back-up goal keeper sophomore Nate Grathwohl, who saved 89 percent of the shots that came his way.
In the finals, Carnegie Mellon faced off against California University of Pennsylvania’s club team. As with the previous night, the Tartans fell behind late in the first period, but quickly rallied with a goal by Fischler, assisted by sophomore Neil Carleton. 
Carleton found Fischler again for a goal in the final seconds of the period on a power play, with the Carleton connection of first-year Kellen Carleton to brother Neil starting the play.
A short-handed goal to start the second with Fichler finding Trice, who found the back of the net, and an unassisted goal by Siwik half way through the third put the game out of reach. The game got chippy in the third period as the referees desperately tried to take control late in the game with a string of penalties at the 4:05 mark on both teams, but ended up in two 10-minute misconducts on the Vulcans. 
With a single second left, California scored a power play goal, but it was too little and too late as the Tartans cruised to the championship title 4–2. After missing the previous game, sophomore Jon Booream returned to the net and had a stellar performance with 29 saves and a 93.5 percent save rate.

While most video games are made purely for entertainment, a new game called “Transcendence,” created by a team of students from Carnegie Mellon’s Entertainment Technology Center (ETC), aims to provide not only an enjoyable experience but also a therapeutic one.
Transcendence began as a semester-long project for a team of students and advisers working in Carnegie Mellon’s ETC. The team created this game with both therapy and entertainment in mind. The game is based on principles of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), a psychological treatment program which attempts to teach patients strategies to encourage healthy thought patterns and reactive behaviors. TF-CBT focuses on patients who have experienced trauma and attempts to facilitate recovery by helping them think and behave in more positive and less destructive ways.
Transcendence could potentially be used as a supplement for the cognitive portion of TF-CBT treatment along with clinical therapy lessons. “The therapeutic component of the TF-CBT process involves establishing a mental link between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors,” said Eric Chang, an ETC master’s student and head programmer for the project. Transcendence operates under the idea that by establishing this link through helping others, the player can come closer to sorting out his or her own interrelated thoughts, feelings and behaviors.The game accomplishes this by incorporating a platform style, which involves moving an avatar between suspended platforms to advance in the game. “The platform game portion is meant to keep the experience entertaining and engaging, [and links] the various therapeutic portions together,” Chang explained. “The most logical way to implement a game for therapy is a text-based choose-your-own-adventure-game, but young children often aren’t patient enough to read through block after block of text, and sometimes have vocabulary limitations as well.” The team settled on the platforming aspect because it kept the focus on the storyline but also engaged the player through active motion.
Transcendence’s storyline is based on an animated African story from the childhood of Etaba Assigana, an ETC master’s student and the project’s creative director. The game’s characters are all animals, and the player assumes the role of an advisory character who must mediate a certain set of social interactions, discover the reason for conflict, and figure out the cognitive reason for each character’s disquieted behavior. By making this link between behaviors and actions in others, the player will hopefully be able to make those associations in his or her own life.
Keeping its audience in mind was one challenge the team faced. “We were designing and building a game for kids who had been traumatized by anything you could imagine. One of our initial ideas involved pirates on the high seas, but concerns for children with fears of deep water and violence prevented that idea from progressing any further,” Chang said.
Assigana expanded upon this idea by explaining the reasoning behind the incorporation of a third-person player perspective. The team “wanted to displace the player from a first-person perspective in these interaction situations to avoid players’ projecting their own negative cognitions into the situations [the characters] present,” Assigana said. Though a large portion of the game design was the experience and the development of empathetic reasoning skills, the team wanted to avoid making the experience immersional to the point that players could be negatively affected by it.
Potentially the most exciting aspect of Transcendence is that it provides entertainment while also achieving goals beyond recreation. Assigana confirmed this by discussing the ability of making games to facilitate social change. “Any type of virtual world — video games, movies, television — offers a way to discuss and [test] new ideas without the potential repercussions of forcing their immediate implementation in the real world,” Assigana said. “Experiences like these can cause players to reflect on decisions our society makes, and how we view each other. I want to make games like these with gameplay styles that appeal to the masses, but which tell stories not often reflected upon by the public consciousness.”
What Assigana speaks to is the ability of popular media to be both entertaining and thought-provoking. In fact, an aspect of gameplay which arguably makes for the richest player experience is depth of plot and complexity of characters. Like Transcendence, some games allow their players to make associations to the real world and possibly even attain a deeper understanding of themselves. This is the point where any media becomes art in the classical sense; it holds up a mirror and gives us a new perspective, allowing us to see parts of ourselves or our world that we never would have otherwise been able to discover.

This past Wednesday, Carnegie Mellon’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) hosted a seminar by Steven Reiss, a professor in the Department of Computer Science at Brown University who has recently focused his research on developing user interfaces that help programmers visualize and understand code. Reiss spoke about his main project, which involves code search, but takes it a step further and allows people to understand the code that they searched for. This project, known as S6, searches code repositories such as Github and Open Hub for files, and tests these files for qualities such as their ability to compile successfully or pass basic checks and tests before running.
The process behind S6 differs from the majority of other available code searches. Searching for code on websites such as Github through their own search engines is often ineffective and difficult. Different styles in code often lead to this ineffectiveness, since variable names and function names will change based on each programmer. When a user does find results for their search in this type of open source environment, the files would then need to be sorted and understood. In open source environments, it is common to find complex files that are difficult to understand and also incomplete files that cannot be compiled.
S6 fixes these issues by finding files related to a user’s search and presenting the files in a graphical form. For example, users can search for code by using keywords, test cases, contracts, signatures, and security constraints. The system will then browse through the repositories and return options to the user in an environment known as the “Rebus,” where users can browse through the different function calls of listed repository codes.
The program also allows users to edit the code and check to see if the code in the search results still work correctly, making the process of searching for a working file much easier.
As of right now, however, S6 has not extended to codes with external dependencies. This means that if a file depends on an outside module or imported file, S6 will not be able to successfully compile and interact with the file. The complexities of files that are not leaf packages, meaning stand alone packages that do not require outside resources, make the installation and implementation of external packages a challenge.
Reiss has been studying this idea of implementing external dependencies in S6. “Some things they’ll work for, and some things they won’t,” Reiss said. “If there’s a specific sequence of things that you must do to build an event and that thing is located somewhere in the system, you may never find it in the repository.” Reiss plans to look more into this area, but acknowledges that the process will take time.
Reiss’ research and projects continue to span several sectors of computer science. He worked on projects such as S6 and a user interface-based development environment known as the Code Bubble that focus on connecting programmers to visualizations of code. Reiss has also worked on smaller projects, including the sign outside of his office door at Brown that tells people whether or not he’s there. This sign is a simple digital picture frame, but the frame is programmed to connect to several data sets that inform Reiss’ location, such as motion sensors in the office room and calendar updates from Google Calendar. Reiss’ projects and research branch in multiple directions today, but will continue to help provide users better interfaces to understand code.

Pugwash’s discussion topic this week was privacy and the Internet of things. Computing power is becoming more powerful, and is being used to record our everyday activities in ways that were never imagined even ten years ago. This explosion of data can provide a better experience for all of us, but at the same time, it puts the minutia of our lives on the Internet, where it could potentially be seen by anyone. Welcome to the Internet of things.
From watches to toothbrushes, thermostats to refrigerators, tech companies are encouraging us to record our activities and send the data up into the cloud, where they can look at it and optimize our experiences. Due to how cheap and available technology is, it is easy to incorporate it into the most mundane aspects of our lives. Manufacturers can put Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tags into products to track them, which work much like barcodes do. Then, they can use the data they collect to find ways to improve the product or use it more efficiently.
The information collected is not just about the devices. Data about specific users is also scooped up and used, most often in advertising. For example, there’s the story of Target mailing a high school student ads for maternity clothes and baby supplies. Her father came in to complain, only to apologize a week later when it turned out that the student was pregnant after all. Target was able to figure it out just through analyzing the patterns of what she was buying.
The data is also used to improve user experience outside of advertising. Google recently bought the company Nest, which sells a smart home thermostat system. By sending usage data to the cloud, where it is then analyzed, the thermostat can tell when you’re home and when you’re not, and learn to adjust the temperature accordingly. While this is an undeniably cool service, there are questions that arise: What if someone got their hands on the data, found out when you were not home, and decided that those times would be good opportunities to rob your house?
Once your personal information is on the Internet, it becomes harder to keep it from falling into the wrong hands. Even if it is only stored on company servers, and not intentionally shared or sold with anyone, there is always a chance that it could get stolen. As soon as you connect a device to the Internet, it becomes fair game to all the hackers in the world.
And even if that data is anonymized, it can still be traced back to you with a high level of certainty. For example smart watches, among other devices, collect health data that might be personally sensitive. Removing your name from the data or trying to clear the metadata (things like the date or location the data was created, or what kind of device it was created on) isn’t a sure bet, because using statistical inferences, it’s possible to narrow down the number of individuals to whom that data could belong. There are only so many people of the exact age, gender, weight, with the same conditions, who walk the same number of steps, who are from the same place, as you. The more data that’s collected, the easier it is to find out who it belongs to.
One proposed solution was to have more regulation on what sort of data could be collected, or what inferences can be made from the data. However, this might hamper the ability of companies to use the information to create the optimal experience, which is the whole point. Making consumers more aware of what data is being collected was another suggestion. Most people don’t think about how if they buy unscented lotion and a large purse, Target might know they’re pregnant. Making it more clear what information is gathered and what it is being used for will allow consumers to make their own choice, if they want to continue to invest in the companies or not.
The Internet of things is coming, and it holds the promise of optimized environments, from toasters to thermostats. However, the amount of data that is collected means that the limits of privacy are being put to the test.

In The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, humans are described as “so amazingly primitive they still think digital watches are a good idea.” In these days of cellphones and “smart watches” that tell you about texts and let you make calls, the digital watch may look a little outmoded. However, while no longer as popular as they once were, digital watches are still a useful piece of everyday technology.
According to a PC Magazine timeline on the history of the digital watch, the first digital watch used gears and springs, just like an analog clock, but displayed numbers instead of moving hands to indicate the time.
The first publicly available watch that used not only a digital display but also digital technology in the form of circuits was the Hamilton Watch Company’s 1972 Hamilton Pulsar. Plated in gold and using a synthetic ruby as part of its LED (Light Emitting Diode) system, the Pulsar cost $2,100 (around $11,400 today, adjusted for inflation). That combination of technology and luxury earned the watch a spot on the wrist of James Bond in 1973’s Live and Let Die.
While there have been several developments in the world of watch innards since the Pulsar came out, perhaps the most important change has been in the display. LEDs are today considered a very energy efficient light bulb, recommended by Forbes Magazine over compact fluorescents for the budget conscious However, the models used in early wrist watches used a lot of power. Further, the wearer would have to temporarily activate the display, a process that required the wearer to use both hands.
PC Magazine’s timeline indicates that the big shift in digital wristwatch technology, from luxury status items costing thousands of dollars to everyday $20 timepieces at your local Walmart, came in 1973 with the introduction of the LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) screen. While early models were almost as power hungry as the LED displays, the 1973 Seiko 06LC introduced the style of LCD still used in most digital watches today.
As their name suggests, liquid crystals have both a consistent shape and structure like crystals, but can flow like liquids. An informative page from Case Western Reserve University explains how the most common type of LCD, the Twisted Nematic Display, works by suspending nematic liquid crystals between two plates of glass. Nematic means “string-like” in Greek and indicates the shape of the crystals, which form a long chain, according to Whatis.com.
When a voltage is applied to a nematic crystal, the molecules that make up the crystal alter their orientation, thus changing their polarization and affecting how much light is able to pass through or be reflected by the crystal. 
They work similarly to microscopic Venetian blinds: they have an “open” position that lets light through when there’s no current, and when electricity is applied to the crystals, they shift positions and polarity, effectively “closing” the blinds. The amount of energy it takes to alter the shape of these crystals in the case of a one color wristwatch screen is very low, which is why watch batteries can last so long.
The key to digital watch displays is that the liquid crystals primarily block or reflect light instead of emitting it. Light bounces off of the “activated” areas and passes through the deactivated areas, but no light is actually cast by a typical LCD screen.
As a result, many watches still have an LED light, but only use it to light up the watch face in the dark when a button is pushed. This draws more power than the LCD display, but it will let you read the time in the dark without constantly drawing extra power when its not needed, while still making it easy to read when there is ambient light.
LCDs make up the faces of most digital watches, so the next time you look to your wrist to figure out the time, remember that this is most likely the science behind what you’re seeing.

Humans wired to see an image in different colors
Since last Thursday, an image of an ambiguously colored dress has gone viral on the Internet, triggering heated debates on social media. While some people see the color of the dress as black and blue — the actual color of the dress — others see it as gold and white.
Such controversy presents an interesting case involving the varying visual perceptions within the human population. Wired to see in daylight, the visual cortex within the human brain takes into account the chromatic bias of the daylight axis when producing an image. In spite of differing lighting conditions, the visual system allows humans to interpret the fixed color of an object. Hence, when people see white and gold colors, their brains remove the blue cast of the dress, with the perception that the image is in dim light. People who see the black and blue colors are under the impression that the image was under bright light.

Physicists pose possible answer to origin of matter
Addressing a mysterious scientific phenomenon, researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) have attributed the asymmetry of matter and antimatter within the universe to the motion of the Higgs field, associated with the Higgs boson particle. The Higgs boson particle is thought to be responsible for all mass in the universe. Elementary particles acquire mass by coupling to the Higgs field.
The researchers believe that after the Big Bang, particles and antiparticles existed in equal amounts, with the exception of a tiny asymmetry amounting to one particle for every billion. 
As the universe cooled, particles and antiparticles annihilated each other in even amounts, leaving a tiny number of particles that gave rise to the stars, planets and gas in today’s universe. 
Thus, the findings, which were published in Physical Review Letters, may explain the origin of matter in the universe.

Dozens of new sinkholes found throughout Siberia
Through satellite, more sinkholes have been discovered in Siberia, and people speculate that there are many more to be found.
While the cause for these sinkholes has not been confirmed, researchers speculate that these craters may have been formed as a result of gas explosions. Last summer, scientists studied craters thought to be formed by the explosion of methane gas. Some researchers speculated that climate change will make sinkholes more common. With the recent discoveries, there have been urgent demands for research to confirm the causes of these craters. However, the potential explosions from gas emissions pose a risk to the well-being of the researchers studying those craters. 
Furthermore, gas emissions have been shown to cause fatal damage on drilling rigs, oil and gas fields, and offshore pipelines, which can ultimately disrupt the operation of oil and gas complexes in northern cities.

Scientists validate the presence of greenhouse gases
Last Wednesday, researchers published a study in Nature that presented the first observational evidence of the direct correlation between increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and the rise in thermal radiation striking the Earth’s surface.
At two sites, one in Alaska and one in Oklahoma, climate scientists measured the quantity of thermal radiation on cloudless days. Since carbon dioxide emits light within a unique range of wavelengths, the team was able to identify energy balance changes that came from the particular gas. After taking measurements for more than a decade, the researchers discovered that an increase in carbon dioxide concentrations of 22 parts per million resulted in an increase in incoming thermal radiation, measured in watts per square meter, of about ten percent.
The team believes that their work supports the theory that human activity has played a part in global warming.

Prosthetic leg with an artificial vision system developed
At the Michigan Technological University, a group of engineers headed by Mo Rastgaar, a professor of mechanical engineering, is developing a prototype of a prosthetic leg that will be able to see where it is going. The artificial vision system will be a low-cost camera that can identify the profile of the ground. Meanwhile, by analyzing the information from the camera, the computer-controlled actuator will determine the location of the next footstep.
Additionally, the computer will calculate the appropriate angle and stiffness of the ankle, allowing for flexibility in motion. A system of cables would control the motion of the ankle. 
The researchers have refined the actuator so that it can be carried in a pocket, rather than on the prosthesis, which will improve ease of use.
The team hopes that one day, the prosthetic leg will be introduced into the market to help patients in need of artificial limbs.

Volvo develops and integrates self-driving vehicles
Recently, the Volvo Group, a Swedish multinational manufacturing company, disclosed the latest developments in its Drive Me project. The project aims to allow self-driving cars to integrate into regular traffic alongside cars with human drivers. A Drive Me vehicle gets accurate information about its surroundings from a high-performance GPS and a high-definition 3-D map.
Working with many different legislative and transportation officials, Volvo hopes to have 100 self-driving vehicles on the road in selected areas around Gothenburg, Sweden, by 2017. The company is working towards a near 100 percent reliability in their autonomous driving system.
Developing compatible infrastructure is also critical for the integration of these self-driving cars. Volvo is working on developing cars that will know what is going on a few miles away from them, not just in their immediate position.

This past week, students on campus were #blessed with the rare opportunity to receive wisdom of all sorts from rapper, motivational speaker, and social media legend Lil B.
His lecture covered a wide span of topics, ranging from awareness (listen to your “spider senses”), identity (“a mouse raised by pigeons”), and ambitions (“Goals, dedication, meditation”).
Lil B’s lecture was focused on three quotes that he prepared especially for the Carnegie Mellon community. The first tied in well with his introduction. He started out his lecture by welcoming “you guys,” but then corrected himself to add women, and then people who may not identify with either categorization. His first quote goes, “You are what you choose to identify with. You have the choice. A mouse raised by pigeons.”
While the metaphor is perhaps a little bit strange, the takeaway was worthwhile. He emphasized that who we are as individuals doesn’t come from labels, especially those imposed by others onto us. Who we are comes from who or what we want to be. Lil B also encouraged audience members to learn the power of empathy — since everybody has a past and their own individual struggles, it is important to lift each other up and be understanding no matter what. He gestured out to all the students in McConomy auditorium, imploring everyone to support each other. “We’re not alone,” he said.
His second quote ushered the lecture into its next phase. This also coincided with the dramatic climax of his speech. His other quotes were more verbose, but in this one, he favored concision while showing off his lyrical know-how. Pausing for emphasis between each word, Lil B had the audience in silent anticipation. “Goals. Dedication. Meditation,” he announced. The takeaway from this quote was one that Carnegie Mellon students especially need to be reminded of. Lil B told us to set goals and stay dedicated to them, which most Tartans are very good at, but the meditation is key. We need to reflect on the progress we’ve made, understand and learn from mistakes, reward ourselves for successes, and allow ourselves to recharge. While Carnegie Mellon students are constantly setting and working toward goals, they often forget to meditate and reflect. Lil B emphasized this part over the others, and hopefully students will take it to heart.
Lil B’s third and final quote dealt with change: “Symbols of hate have now become beacons of hope and love. We have to accept the new to understand what’s coming ahead and continue to be inquisitive with the status quo.” While he never exactly defined which symbols he was referring to, the bottom line is still meaningful. Nothing in this world is concrete, and things will always change. We must continue to accept the changes that life will inevitably bring and adapt. Lil B also used this as an opportunity to warn placing too much value in material things. The most important thing is that we’re alive, and we can’t forget that.
While many of the lessons Lil B brought to Carnegie Mellon are ones that we’ve probably heard before, his delivery is what made them unique. It felt as though Lil B showed up as Brandon McCartney, a real person, and not Lil B the Based God, a persona. Aside from remarks like “We’re all stars, not just me” and “All of my work is great,” Lil B addressed the audience on a very human level. He offered up lessons that are meaningful to him. The sincerity that persisted throughout the evening was really what made his lessons special.

When you write about the Academy Awards, it’s difficult to write about just the awards themselves. It’s been a contentious awards season, and the drama didn’t stop on Oscar Sunday, Feb. 22.
The red carpet, as always, did not fail to impress. Highlights included Anna Kendrick of Pitch Perfect and Into the Woods fame, who stunned in a rose-colored gown. Jennifer Aniston, who has apparently not aged since 1998, wore a slim-fitting nude gown, playing into the evening’s trend of tasteful, light gowns — a turn away from the traditional Oscar evening gowns in jewel tones.
Zendaya, a little-known 18-year-old Disney Channel actress and singer, became the center of a controversy when Fashion Police host Giuliana Rancic joked that her dreadlocked hair looked like it “smelled like patchouli oil” or “weed.” Zendaya called Rancic out for her racist comments on her Instagram; Rancic soon apologized and did what all TV hosts do best: blamed a writer for the misfired joke.
Academy Awards host Neil Patrick Harris opened his monologue by welcoming the Academy’s “best and whitest … I mean brightest,” aiming at the 2015 nominees’ blatant lack of diversity. Although it’s good that everyone’s aware of the problem, a throwaway joke doesn’t do much toward fixing it.
Lady Gaga also performed at the Oscars, keeping up her publicity high after recent engagement to B-list Chicago Fire star Taylor Kinney. Gaga’s Sound of Music medley impressed many, making the world wonder if she’s finally ready to recover from ARTPOP. Gaga capitalized on her Oscar performance when she announced mid-last week that she will star in American Horror Story: Hotel, the show’s fifth season.
Among the actual awards, there were few real surprises. Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) won Best Picture, much to my chagrin after I made Boyhood my top pick. It’s still not too surprising that Birdman, a film that grittily portrays what it feels like to be a faded Hollywood elite (something many Academy members are all too familiar with) won Best Picture. Birdman also rightfully took home Best Cinematography and Best Directing.
Best Actor went to Eddie Redmayne for his stirring portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything; he did a good job of capturing Hawking’s chronic motor neuron disorder. Best Supporting Actress went to Patricia Arquette for her role in Boyhood; Arquette was lauded further after she called in her acceptance speech for wage equality for women.
Big Hero 6 won best animated feature, a surprise to me — truthfully, I think that the award still rightfully belongs to the snubbed The Lego Movie, which was tossed a scrap of glory when it won Best Original Song for the indestructible earworm “Everything Is Awesome.”
Julianne Moore won Best Actress for Still Alice, a movie that’s been on my watch list for a month, but I haven’t had a chance to see yet. J.K. Simmons won Best Supporting Actor for Whiplash, in which he played a terrifying director of an elite New York music school’s jazz band and gave me nightmare flashbacks to experiences with my high school marching band director.
The Academy Awards are a cyclone of culture, media, and fashion, and this year’s Awards ceremony was as interesting as any other’s. This year, however, it felt a little bit like many of the winners themselves were less important than the conversation on race and gender equality that played into the event.

I thought it impossible to best last year's shocking opening episode to season two of House of Cards. I was wrong. Even before the credits and the absurdly long theme song opened season three, Frank Underwood had already shocked and scandalized, urinating on his father's gravestone. Seriously, is there anything that's holy to this monster?
But I settled in to watch anyway, because like any other addict to this Netflix original blockbuster, I love to hate these characters. And hate them I do, especially after episode one (or, as Netflix snootily calls it, chapter 27). Instead of picking up literally seconds after the end of the previous season as it did last year, season three plunges us deep into a world where Underwood has been president for months and is in the middle of a standoff against Congress. (Hmm, why does that sound familiar?).
The show helps us to catch up through the life of Underwood's loyal aide Doug, who disappointingly did not bite the dust deep in the Maryland woods and is working on healing wounds both inside and out. We find that Claire is batting cleanup for her husband Francis (what else is new?) and she's getting tired of it, ready to make a go of her own at the political world (finally). Things don't seem good anywhere, from the bedrooms of the West Wing, where contention brews, to Doug's house — where he self-medicates with drugs, alcohol, and prostitutes — to the fictionalized Middle East, where the U.S. is busy killing opposition leaders while they should be negotiating.
The first episode was confusing: Well over half of it focused on Doug and his depression following the accident at the end of season two. In fairness, director John Coles had a lot to remind us about after the whirlwind of computer hacking, lesbian ex-prostitutes, lawsuits, and betrayals in which season two ended. Why choose to hook us in with Doug, a character who, at least in my eyes, has nary a redeeming quality to speak of?
As usual, the show is a masterpiece that's beautifully planned, if stressful, to watch. The music, composed by genius Jeff Beal, is one of the most attractive parts of the show. It's the icing on the cake that sets the scene for the rest of the show tonally — a beautiful complement to the breathtaking cinematography. The first episode was a strong and quiet start to a season that promises more drama, backstabbing, game-playing, life-ruining, and plot-twisting. This trend brings to mind one important question: Is this a sustainable model for such a drama-fueled storyline?
While the writers of the show have yet to disappoint us, the intense satisfaction of the show doesn't feel like it can go on forever. Just how many kind-of-main-characters can you kill before we start predicting the deaths? And when will it end? The first two seasons showed Francis’s and Claire's fast-paced, cutthroat rise to power, but now that he's president, many fans, myself included, are wondering where we have to go from here. There are only so many positions that would be more exciting than leader of the free world, and let's be honest: Dictator of the world involves a little too much suspension of disbelief.
The world will certainly be watching as Netflix decides where to take the award-winning show next. Regardless of their other successful franchises, House of Cards remains a focal point. Where the show goes and how it gets there will set a precedent for Netflix-exclusive content, as well as for just how far a political drama can go.

This week’s sweets are brought to you by the letter N for nostalgia (also maybe nachos and newspaper).
When I’m in The Tartan office each week, I inevitably run down to Entropy to grab some chips or popcorn to munch on while I work. It’s all just part of my process, because I’m a genius and geniuses just have those. But I’m getting pretty tired of potato chips, Doritos, and Smartfood popcorn while I swig from my gallon-sized jug of Arizona iced tea. It’s delicious, but I need a change of pace. Maybe something sweet. Something I can still mindlessly munch on. And ideally, something easy. You know what’s all of those things? Puppy chow.
If you’ve never heard of puppy chow, you are in for a treat. Depending on where you come from, you may know it as muddy buddies, sweet minglers, or white trash. It doesn’t matter what you call it, it’s still perfect. Classic puppy chow is Chex cereal coated in a delightful chocolate peanut butter mixture, then tossed in powdered sugar. So simple, so addicting, and not for the weak-willed.
While the original is delicious, there are actually hundreds of variations. Cookies and cream, red velvet, lemon, peppermint, thin mint, hot chocolate, cookie dough, and the list just keeps going. Since I am so benevolent, I wanted to make enough for the whole office to enjoy. And I figured, why not make two kinds? Twice the fun! I made both the classic — because it’s kind of a sin to mess with something that’s already so perfect — and also a cake batter variation. Cake batter is one of my favorite dessert flavors ever, only second maybe to cotton candy.
Quick equipment suggestion: I actually don’t have any mixing bowls in my apartment. I do all my baking in a large pot, which is pretty strange. So when I was at Giant Eagle to shop for ingredients, I found a set of two big plastic Tupperware mixing bowls for only $6.50. They even have lids which were perfect for shaking in the powdered sugar at the end. Using these inexpensive tupperware or something similar will greatly improve the ease with which you can create this delicious treat.
Original Puppy Chow
5 cups of Chex cereal
1/2 cup of chocolate chips (I prefer milk chocolate, but if semisweet is your thing, you have my blessing)
1/3 cup of peanut butter
2 tablespoons of butter
3/4 cup of powdered sugar
This is a recipe where the work is so little and the reward is so tremendous that you might start dancing with joy. Start by measuring out the cereal into a pretty big bowl or even a gallon sized zip lock bag, if you’re short on bowls. Next heat the chocolate chips, peanut butter and butter in a small pot over pretty low heat, stirring frequently because burned chocolate is a tragedy. When this melts into a smooth shiny sauce, pour it into the bowl of cereal. Then stir it up, but be really super gentle so you don’t crush the cereal. Finally dump in the powdered sugar and shake it all up. Let it sit for a little while so the chocolate coating can come back to room temperature. After five or so minutes, dig in!
Cake Batter Puppy Chow
5 cups of Chex cereal
1/4 cup of butter
3 tablespoons of heavy cream
10 ounces of white chocolate
1 teaspoon of almond extract
2/3 cup of rainbow sprinkles
1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar
This is going to be almost identical to the first recipe, but with a few tweaks here and there. Still start out by putting the cereal into a big bowl. Next melt the white chocolate, heavy cream, and butter over low heat, stirring all the while. This mixture will be much less beautiful than the chocolate peanut butter one, because white chocolate just has a different texture. It will be a little thick and goopy, but delicious nonetheless! Once it’s all melted together, stir in the almond extract and pour the mixture over the cereal. After that’s all mixed up, add the sprinkles and give it another stir. Add the powdered sugar, shake it around, and you’re done. Let it set for a few minutes, then proceed to stuff your face. I will be incredibly impressed if you have any left the next day.

One of Carnegie Mellon University’s best-kept secrets is its annual International Film Festival. The festival, this year titled Faces of Work, is the only student-run International Film Festival in the country. Most films are shown in McConomy Auditorium, but there are some other venues around Pittsburgh that will show a few of the 18 films being screened. The Festival officially begins on March 19, but on Friday night in McConomy, captivated audiences received with a “sneak preview.”
The main event of the preview was the film Song from the Forest. Additionally, the evening consisted of a percussion performance led by ethnomusicologist and native Congolese Anicet Mundundu, a video introduction by director Michael Obert, and a panel and reception with distinguished scholars and David Rothenberg, the film’s Music Supervisor.
Song from the Forest follows the journey of Louis Sarno, an American musicologist, who moved to the Central African rainforest after listening to the music of the native groups in the region. Sarno has lived among the Bayaka, a specific tribe of Baka people, for the past 25 years. The film is essentially an in-depth portrait of the Bayaka people, their music, and the man who fell in love with their way of life. In the film, Sarno takes his 13-year-old son Samedi back with him to America for a visit, and viewers are able to view the dichotomy between the two lifestyles through his eyes.
The film is chock-a-block full of juxtapositions: The landscapes of the Central African rainforest and the towering skyscrapers of New York City are shocking and switched between abruptly; the chaotic-sounding polyphonic music of the Bayaka and the synchronized polyphony of Renaissance choral music pair in an interesting soundtrack; Sarno himself explores the ideas of solitude versus community, noise versus silence, and black versus white. Song from the Forest raises a lot of important questions about society and the meaning of life, as audiences are forced to question what makes an individual feel at peace.
Sarno came to live with the Bayaka because of their music, and thus the film is filled with the noises and sounds from his home in the Central African forest. The film doesn’t just capture the musical traditions and performances of the people; it emphasizes the music that is present in the everyday lives of these hunter gatherers. Children gathering water from the river do not hesitate to slap the water in a complex and playful rhythm; men taking a break from hunting listen and respond to an old man’s song; young boys dance naked in a mud puddle as older children around them laugh and clap. Even the sounds of the forest, and the deafening rain, fill audience’s ears as they watch Sarno live and work among these people.
Sarno is a complex man whose life is “paradoxical,” as panelist David Cronenberg described it after the film. For instance, Cronenberg further explained, no one is totally sure whether or not Sarno has any money. In the film Sarno talks about feeling stressed about the amount of debt he has accrued helping the Bayaka build a school  and get medical attention. He feels guilty because the Bayaka always assume that he is able to buy and give them things because he is a Westerner, and he isn’t sure how to convince them otherwise. However, he flies back to New York City and buys toys for his son, so his true financial situation is a little unclear. His brother is very wealthy, but the financial relationship between the two is never discussed and this lack of dialogue is hugely apparent.
At one point toward the end of the film, Sarno and Samedi walk down the streets of New York City after leaving a toy store, and Samedi is heckling his father to buy him a gun. In the moment it seems like any young boy asking his father for a gun, which his father then denies him. The film’s poignancy comes up a few minutes later, as Samedi sits on the edge of a bed musing over his toys. He openly expresses annoyance with his father, who has little-to-no interest in buying Samedi things that will be useful back home. Samedi lists some items, like “underwear, shirts, shoes,” as well as guns, which would have a major effect on the efficiency of the Bayaka hunting style. But Sarno is disinterested in bringing back such items, and instead he buys Samedi a water gun and other toys.
Why is Sarno hesitant to bring back items to aid the Bayaka? Why is he so uninterested in any of his American family and friends visiting him in the forest? These questions delve deep into Sarno’s thinking and natural behavior. Sarno’s life in Africa has clearly inspired him, and many clips from the movie are Sarno’s troubled face, thinking, as well as his occasional musings about the Bayaka. He’s self-effacing and self-absorbed in turn, dismissing Western culture, acting somewhat cold toward others, and lavishing praise with regularity.
The panelists touched on many of these themes throughout the discussion following the film. Sarno’s life is an enigma that even the filmmakers are still trying to understand. After the panel, audience members enjoyed a reception in CUC Connan, where they were able to snack on delicious Congolese treats.
Many of the movies being screened during the Festival have special guest speakers or audience members and will be followed by a reception. The 18 films featured come from 12 countries around the globe, and will introduce a multitude of perspectives. Not only is Song from the Forest an excellent film that everyone should see, it indicates perfectly that the rest of Carnegie Mellon’s International Film Festival will be superb.

On Friday night, a cappella enthusiasts from around Carnegie Mellon, around Pittsburgh, and even a handful from Michigan gathered in McConomy Auditorium to watch their favorite groups compete in the Great Lakes International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA) quarterfinals. McConomy was full to bursting, with individuals standing in the back and lining the stairs. Completely unintentionally, I managed to find a seat in the row where all the judges, scorekeepers, and timekeepers sat. Under their book lights, the judges scribbled furiously on clipboards during the performances, analyzing each of the ten groups’ strengths and weaknesses in a variety of categories.
The evening of a cappella craziness was hosted by Carnegie Mellon’s very own Brad Plaxen, a senior electrical and computer engineering and English double major. Having been an MC for other events on campus, Plaxen seemed comfortable addressing the huge audience. While introducing the show, Plaxen got the audience guffawing after preparing them to hear “a lot of top 40 songs from the last three months that you’re tired of. A lot of Taylor Swift. Actually that’s unconfirmed, but she’s actually here tonight, here in McConomy. Taylor Swift just loves a cappella.” Ridiculous quips like this had the audience giggling and kept the energy light throughout the over-three-hour-long show.
Each group was limited to 12 minutes’ worth of a cappella glory. Plaxen made numerous comments about keeping the clapping between songs to a minimum in order to expedite each set. The first group of the evening — and the only group from out of state — specifically asked for no applause until the end, as their set was timed to fill the 12 minutes almost exactly. The Gold Vibrations, a co-ed a cappella group from Oakland University in Rochester Hills, Michigan, performed a lively set including the current toe-tapping favorite, Mark Ronson’s “Uptown Funk” featuring Bruno Mars.
With charming choreography and sets that seemed to be pulled off seamlessly, even the littlest mistakes could ruin a group’s chances to take home a coveted prize or advance to the semifinals. The second group, the University of Pittsburgh’s C Flat Run, included the first soloist of the evening who sent chills up my spine. His rendition of “Supremacy” by Muse sent his voice soaring to incredible high notes.
The evening was full of knock-your-socks-off talent, as well as plenty of funny moments and numbers. The University of Pittsburgh’s Pitt Pendulums arranged Miley Cyrus’s “Party in the USA” to merge into other numbers such as “New York” and “Oops I Did it Again” before each chorus. I always find men giving their all while singing vintage Britney Spears to be enjoyable and highly entertaining.
The first Carnegie Mellon group of the evening stunned with another inspired arrangement. Counterpoint, the only all-female a cappella group at Carnegie Mellon, had the genius idea of pairing Beyonce’s “Crazy in Love” with Gnarls Barkley’s “Crazy.” Their performance also included a rousing “Summertime Sadness” by Lana del Rey and a wonderful version of Katy Perry’s “Dark Horse” (replete with Jessie J’s rap).
Pittch Please, an all-male a cappella group from University of Pittsburgh — and the first-place winners of the evening — earned the audience’s respect and admiration with a variety of flawlessly arranged and executed songs. The soloist who sang Jessie J’s part in Bang Bang performed tons of animation and impressive intonation as his voice slipped and slid over the runs and performed vocal gymnastics. Pittch Please’s staging was also perfect: entertaining, but not at the expense of the vocals. At one point the members pretended to be various instruments.
The other two Carnegie Mellon groups to perform took the stage by storm. The Originals, an all-male ensemble, delivered a complex and majestic performance. One of the most enjoyable moments of the evening was the mash-up of jazzy-blues ballad “Cry Me a River” with Justin Timberlake’s popular song of the same name. Freshman musical theatre major Kyle Pitts performed the ballad — famously covered by jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald — soulfully, as the rest of the group backed him up with spunky lines from Justin Timberlake’s version.
Carnegie Mellon’s co-ed group The Treblemakers performed a set that showed off their ability to perform melodic and fast-paced number with ease. Senior BXA student Bridget McCoy delivered a beautiful version of Rihanna’s “Stay” and sophomore psychology major Reagan Henke sang Calvin Harris’ “Sweet Nothing” with an amazing amount of power and emotion. Entertaining and impressive dancing accompanied the vocals, so it was no surprise that The Treblemakers took home the award for best choreography.
The evening was certainly long, but it was hard to complain when there was the opportunity to watch so many talented people doing what they love. If you didn’t feel sorry for yourself regarding your personal singing talent, the funny bios of each group in the program definitely made you feel substantially less cool. During the period before the winners were announced, the audience was entertained with performances from Infra Dance Company and improv troupe No Parking Players.
Carnegie Mellon groups won all of the prizes except first prize. Second prize went to The Originals, and third prize went to the Treblemakers. In addition to winning best choreography, Bridget McCoy of the Treblemakers won Best Soloist. Junior global studies major Diana Pacilio won Best Vocal Percussion for Counterpoint, and composition major Stephen Murphy won Best Arrangement for The Originals.
All in all, the ICCA quarterfinals once again blew the audience away with their whirlwind of vocal majesty.

Everyone searches to find a little bit of themselves in a television character. Historically, women have struggled with this, because there have been few types of female characters on screen. The roles of women on television have lacked racial and religious diversity. They have lacked diversity of lifestyle interests, sexual orientation, physical appearance, and diversity in the ways in which they think and feel. Even characters who have been hailed as breaths of fresh air have been overshadowed by the homogeneity of their industry counterparts. This is not to say that there haven’t been terrific characters played by talented actresses over the years, but we now live in a time where some audiences are cognizant of the lack of diversity. There have been significant steps to improve representation on television. While there are still tons of women who are not represented on screen, there are a few current characters that are inspirational to women for being honest, complex, and relatable.
Coming off an awards season that featured controversial statements from Patricia Arquette about the issues women face in America, as well as statements from other stars about the increasing representation of women on screen, it is important to take a moment to reflect on the state of women in television and the increasing diversity of their characters.
One of the most eloquent explanations of the positive female-character trend in TV was spoken by actress Maggie Gyllenhaal upon receiving the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Miniseries or TV Movie. She said, “when I look around the room at the women who are here and think about the performances that I’ve watched this year, what I see actually are women who are sometimes powerful and sometimes not, sometimes sexy, sometimes not, sometimes honorable, sometimes not, and what I think is new is the wealth of roles for actual women in television and in film. That’s what I think is revolutionary and evolutionary and it’s what’s turning me on.” That is the kind of progress that has been made in television over the past couple of years.
Oftentimes, people search for the evidence of diversification of roles by lauding roles where women have positions of power. But as Gyllenhaal stated, true character diversity stems from the depiction of women with real flaws, and diverse priorities and lifestyles.
The rise of female characters in leadership, however, should not be downplayed. It is vital to see career-minded women on screen. Notable characters that demonstrate women in leadership include Parks and Recreation’s Leslie Knope, Mindy from The Mindy Project, Olivia Pope from Scandal, Liz Lemon from 30 Rock, and Annalise Keating from How to Get Away with Murder. All of these shows have created characters with whom other women identify.
As a college student, it has been interesting for me to see shows that explore the complexities of life after graduation trying to find a path that doesn’t necessarily require marriage or children. It is interesting to watch women as successful leaders and mothers, but it is hugely illustrative to watch a young woman navigate her path, making mistakes and great choices in life and love as she tries to determine what her dreams are. A show that does just this is Lena Dunham’s Girls on HBO. Now a couple of seasons in, Dunham’s characters continue to struggle and find their passions. Comedy Central’s Broad City also follows the lives of its two protagonists as they try to live out their dream in New York City, encountering obstacles and triumphing over them.
Netflix’s Orange is the New Black is another show that has been commended for the diversity of its female characters. One of few shows to examine women’s sexuality in depth, Orange is the New Black allows audiences to see the vulnerabilities and strengths of flawed, and in this case incarcerated, women. How to Get Away with Murder also explores themes wherein female characters have to walk a morally ambiguous line and make the best choice of the options presented. These shows represent the multifaceted nature of all women and the messy choices that everyone has to make.
The women in all of these programs are aspirational, instructive, and fascinating figures, but are also still relatively limited in their demographic representations. They are mostly college-educated women from supportive, middle- to upper-class families who interact with other highly educated people. A huge majority are heterosexual. Very few shows delve into the religious quandaries and beliefs of the characters.
This is not to say that female representation on television is waning. It has grown and improved significantly, even in the last decade. In the past year, shows such as Orphan Black have portrayed transgender and homosexual female characters. Television shows continue to bring more racial diversity to screen. However there is a long way to go to success. There are significant gaps and experiences that are not yet shown on screen. But as society aims to right this, let’s not forget that television has been introducing us to more nuanced, developed characters. We hope to see more shows move in this direction.

On Friday night, The Frame Gallery glowed with the words and stories of Carnegie Mellon students. Small, square screens and projections stood out against the dark night, the only source of light within the gallery. The installation show is titled “My Heart Is In The Work,” recalling the university’s motto, famously penned by Andrew Carnegie. The show explores the stress culture perpetuated throughout the Carnegie Mellon community. As told by senior communication design major Sam Ahmed, who created the show, stress culture can be defined as “a culture where two consecutive all-nighters merits a badge of honor, rather than concern.”
Mounted on each wall are grids of screens reminiscent of the digital screens many students encounter on a daily basis. Columns of square light boxes showed social media posts from members of the Carnegie Mellon community. While names and faces are censored, each post reflects a student’s struggles or successes related to their experience at this university. Some student visitors pointed to pieces and chuckled, remarking “Look it’s me!” or “I know who posted this.”
“Some of these [posts] are jokes, and some of these are legitimately harmless, funny jokes,” Ahmed said. “Some of them are maybe more coping mechanisms to hide a deeper problem.”
Interspersed throughout the Facebook and Twitter posts are quotes printed in large, black letters. The quotes are taken from the article, “The happy mask: Carnegie Mellon must address stress culture,” written by Katie Chironis (DC `12) for The Tartan in 2012.
“[Chironis] wrote the article when I was a sophomore,” Ahmed said. “That was the year Henry Armero died, and stress culture was a really big issue, and it wasn’t talked about as much. And she wrote this amazing article that went viral and everybody was posting it. I wanted to incorporate that, and I think everyone should read it.”
Between the grids of screens are slideshows that project unattributed quotes onto the university’s spring 2014 dean’s lists, which used to adorn the walls of the Cohon University Center, statements such as “I’d rather stick needles in my eyeballs than come back here,” “this isn’t even worth it,” and “I’ve never felt more dumb in my life.” Every few minutes, the slideshows would turn black and flash “are you okay” before repeating their cycles.
In the middle of the room is a collection of notes written by students. On index cards, many detailed times when their stress wasn’t worth it, or times when stress was overwhelming yet they felt inclined to continue with their work. Others wrote why they felt their struggles with stress were worth it in the end.
Introduced to stress culture in high school before enrolling at Carnegie Mellon, Ahmed didn’t see that it was a problem until he watched his friends struggle. “I didn’t realize how bad of an issue it was for me until my friends told me that this isn’t how it’s supposed to be,” he said. Since enrolling, Ahmed has worked on several different projects focusing on stress culture and the different ways students express their stress.
Ahmed said that his installation focuses on microaggressions: subtle actions that in isolation are not too damaging, but when added up represent a larger problem in a community. “‘[Microaggression]’ is a term that traditionally used to describe situations that involve racism, and I’ve taken that term to be applicable in a lot of different situations. I think in this one, it’s very applicable,” he said.
“I want people to take a closer look at the way they communicate with each other, whether that be learning to reach out for help or the more subtle things,” Ahmed said. “Looking at microaggressions, and seeing how when you say something like, ‘Did you do your homework?’ and maybe someone’ll reply, ‘No,’ and you say, ‘Oh come on, you only have four classes.’ Things like that are sometimes okay, but sometimes the person really is having a hard time with a reputably easy class, or less units, or is just having a hard time. Trying to do less of that in our culture would be a good way to start addressing the problem.”
“My Heart Is In The Work” will be on display at The Frame through March 7.

Dear Evan,
I wrote to you last semester about my regrettable swipe to the right on Tinder, and how I got locked into a date with a guy I never wanted to see. Your advice saved my butt, and being that vulgar and uninhibited on a dinner date was some of the most fun I’ve ever had.
I deleted Tinder, and I’m in a steady relationship with my job — sitting on cars in short skirts and bikinis for Ford advertisements. But Tinder doesn’t seem to be done with me. Yesterday, my friend in Edinburgh, Scotland messaged me on Facebook, and apparently, someone there has been using my portfolio shots from my work to catfish men.
I did use work photos on Tinder the week before I deleted the app, but I never thought someone would end up using them! If my bosses find out, I’ll have to go back to nude modeling for adult amateur art classes.
How can I discreetly get this Scottish bastard to delete his fake profile?
Thanks,
Typical Idiot Not Doing Everything Right with my Body, Always Incises my Top Out Of Photos (Seriously)
Dear TINDER BAIT, OOPS,
I’m glad my advice from last time worked out so well! But you’re working as a sexy car ornament now? That’s a pretty lucrative way to show off your body, probably much more so than Tuesday art nights at the elder hostel. 
So, I guess … follow your dreams?
I think you’re overreacting a little here. I don’t know how many catfish scams are unveiled per day, but with the climbing popularity of dating and hookup apps, it’s got to be up there. At least the likelihood of you knowing this identity-stealing Scottish clown is pretty low, unless this was your friend’s odd, covert way of turning him or herself in. 
So, you could alert the app’s admins, and they could suspend this guy’s profile. Unfortunately, that’s probably as far as the company will go: While what he’s doing is a crime, Tinder will likely want to avoid legal drama surrounding incidences of catfishing — which, again, I assume happen pretty often, since I have no faith in human decency online.
I suggest you find the fake profile and spam him from multiple accounts with a clip of Kevin Kline from A Fish Called Wanda yelling “A**hooooooooole!”
Then report him anyway,
Evan Kahn

Two weeks ago, Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science (SCS) mistakenly sent out around 800 acceptances to its prestigious master’s of science program. Out of those 800 acceptances, only about 90 of those were to the rightful recipients.
This week, Dean of SCS Andrew Moore spoke with The Tartan about what caused the mistake.
According to Moore, the mishap was the result of three separate problems that all had to occur in order to create this result.
The first was a software error. The department recently made changes to the software they use to notify applicants, and before the software could go live, they ran a test. That test showed that there was a problem with the system. Administrators sent a description of this problem to all of the school’s master’s programs, including a manual workaround that was to be used when sending out admissions notifications. 
The other six master’s programs were able to do it successfully. The second failure was the Computer Science Department’s implementation of the workaround. 
The software also had a built-in check before any emails are sent out that asks the users “Are you sure you want to send out [800] acceptances?” The third failure came when a faculty member, whose name has not been released, selected “yes,” sending out all of the emails.
Approximately seven hours later, a second email was sent out to all of those who received the false acceptance. It came with an apology and the contact information for Moore and department head Frank Pfenning.
“Earlier this morning, we mistakenly sent you an offer of admission to Carnegie Mellon’s MS in CS program,” the correction email read. “This was an error on our part. While we certainly appreciate your interest in our program, we regret that we are unable to offer you admission this year.”
Moore explained that once they realized what had happened, “there was an all hands on deck effort to ... distinguish between the people who had been correctly sent admissions and the ones who had incorrectly been sent admissions letters.”
They then took measures to ensure that every mistake made would be corrected, Moore said. The first priority was to address the incorrect acceptances, but after that was done, confirmation emails were issued to all of the applicants who the department had truly accepted.
Moore said that their entire admissions system is currently in lockdown to prevent mistakes like this one in the future. Moore himself must personally approve all activity within the admissions system, and for the rest of the semester, all acceptances will be sent out one at a time. Rejections, however, will still be sent out en masse. Moore also said that reverting to hard copies of letters, sent through the mail, was not an option that they were considering. Their goal is to create a sustainable system that works exactly as it should, Moore said.
The department is also in the process of writing a detailed software postmortem, or an autopsy for the software the department used during the admissions process. SCS hopes to draw conclusions from what worked and what did not work so that future projects can build upon strengths of their system and prevent the same mistakes from reoccurring. A shortened version of this report will be published in the coming weeks.

Students said goodbye to the Panther Hollow Inn, a popular bar for the campus community located at 4611 Forbes Avenue that closed its doors for the last time at the end of the last academic year.
Since that time, the building has been gutted. The view from the street shows the bar and booths gone and the tiles torn out. An old mural on one wall, revealed by the removal of drywall, shows handpainted banners from both Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.
Despite a prior application approved by the Department of City Planning for renovating the property, which indicated that work would be completed in time for an occupancy date of Jan. 15, the building has stood empty since that date, with no obvious signs of further renovation or construction.
A more recent application, if approved, will have the building demolished and an entirely new Chipotle restaurant built on the lot. The proposed process, according to the filed plans, will take from the first of May to the first of September to complete, and is projected to cost $500,000.
Chipotle Mexican Grill is a popular choice for students on campus, so much so that a nearby location at 3619 Forbes Avenue, just minutes away from the new site by either foot or bus, is looking forward to opening day.
“I think it’s going to be really good,” Stacey Mermigos, a part-time manager at the 3619 Forbes Avenue location and a junior student of psychology at the University of Pittsburgh, said of having another location so close. “Right now we’ve got students from CMU and Pitt and Carlow, as well as all the workers from the hospital, and I know it’s frustrating for customers to have to wait.… It’ll be good for the CMU students, but it will also take a lot of pressure off of our store and our crew.”
Student reactions to the development are generally positive.
“I think it’ll be nice to have one closer to here since the one in Oakland is always so crowded,” said Jasio Santillan, a first-year materials science and engineering and biomedical engineering double major.
Senior dramaturgy major Rachel Abrams said, “Knowing how popular Chipotle is, they’re going to make a lot. It’s probably going to be a successful business venture, but at the same time a lot of people miss PHI. A big contingent of students really loved it. As for me, I’m graduating, so I don’t really care as much.”
The construction is being run by Pittsburgh company Winthorpe Valentine, LP. The phone number for Winthorpe Valentine listed on the form appears to be incorrect, and the project’s listed architects, Morgan Architecture + Design, could not be reached for comment.

Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto planned to visit campus twice last week, but only made it once.
Peduto spoke at the monthly Pittsburgh Student Government Council (PSGC) on Tuesday, and while he intended to address the Undergraduate Student Senate on Thursday, he ultimately canceled.
Addressing the Pittsburgh Student Government Council in the Rachel Mellon Walton Room in Posner Hall, Peduto focused on how students can engage with the further growth and development of the city.
“I can remember vividly in the 1980s stepping onto this campus.... Pittsburgh was drastically different,” the mayor recalled, saying that the city had been through “an economic collapse. Not a recession, a collapse.”
“We had to reinvent ourselves,” he continued, mentioning past Carnegie Mellon President Richard Cyert, who “put out a different call” than those just wanting to reopen the city’s steel mills.
“He talked about what could be, rather than what was,” Peduto explained, recalling that Cyert’s ideas of reinventing Pittsburgh through technology and education were not well received.
Peduto spoke of continuing these goals into the future to improve the city.
“We have the ability to become a model of what a 21st century city should be,” he said.
According to the PSGC’s website, the organization was founded in 2009 after  then-mayor Luke Ravenstahl proposed a tax on university tuition that would be paid by students in the city. After a series of gatherings and the creation of a petition signed by over 10,000 people, the tax was withdrawn by the end of the year.
PSGC Public Relations Chair Sarah Jugovic further described the PSGC in an email as “a distinctive council comprised of student leaders representing Carlow University, Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham University, Community College of Allegheny County, Duquesne University, La Roche College, Point Park University, Robert Morris University, and University of Pittsburgh.”
Peduto was at the founding meeting of PSGC as a city councilman with seven university presidents. Peduto recalled that the tuition tax “went against everything we were promoting ourselves to be.”
“We would be the only city in the world that penalized not sin, but productivity. There are sin taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, but there is no city that taxes education,” he said.
Peduto began his talk by asking PSGC members in the room to introduce themselves, after saying, “when you ask what my vision of Pittsburgh is, it’s to keep you guys here.”
The mayor spent most of his speech drawing together the idea of retaining young students in the city and boosting the city’s population and development, but also connecting those goals’ benefits to those Pittsburgh residents who are less fortunate.
“For fifty years of my life I only saw one thing: People leave this city. My entire life I saw this city lose population. I was told the best I would ever be able to do is manage decline,” Peduto said. “We’re done with that model. We’re done with that expectation. We’re going to become a city that’s growing.”
The mayor spoke of the need to build a tax base to help fund development efforts, and hopes to do this through contributions and partnerships with non-profit companies and businesses.
“Forty percent of our tax base is non-taxable,” he explained, saying that if Pittsburgh is to grow there is a need for revenue sharing and public-private partnerships.
“We look to our universities and hospitals as engines of economic development,” the mayor said, mentioning that the recent deal between Uber and Carnegie Mellon “could be huge” for the city.
Peduto spoke glowingly of School of Computer Science Dean Andrew Moore, who he said played a large role in Google deciding to set up an office in Pittsburgh. Peduto recalled a meeting with Moore where he asked him what the city could do for him and Moore simply replied, “clean your air; clean your water.”
The mayor connected this comment to the environmental reforms pushed by past Pittsburgh mayor David Lawrence, more than twenty years before any clean air and water regulations were being considered by Congress.
The environmental improvements that Peduto talked of served to connect all the goals related to economic development back to improving the well-being of Pittsburgh residents. “There’s a bigger challenge,” he said, “thirty percent of this city lives in poverty. Thirty percent of this city has no ladder of opportunity.”
When asked by Graduate Student Assembly Vice President of External Affairs and engineering and public policy Ph.D. student Will Frankenstein about public transportation funding in the city, particularly the development of light rail, the mayor spoke plainly about the need for improvement.
“We need to invest in our public transportation,” he said, painting a picture of a connected city representing opportunities for its residents.
Peduto then outlined plans for community meetings and a website where people could contribute their ideas for improving Pittsburgh’s transit system. He said that online “you can play almost a Sim City-like game of building your own system.... We have to be able to connect it all.”
Peduto did not shy away from talking about costs either, adding that funding transportation improvements would have to be publicly discussed, and suggested the possibility of spreading out the tax burden between different sources such as sales taxes and sin taxes.
“I’m very cynical of politics,” Peduto remarked, noting the irony of his statement. “I spent my 20s and early 30s running political campaigns and became so sick by it. I enjoy the government side much more.”
Peduto said that he saw the economic future of Pittsburgh being tied to three things: improving public transit, fixing the city’s sewer overflow problem, and the development of Pittsburgh International Airport.
“These are the three key areas we’re missing,” he said.
Peduto spoke of Pittsburgh’s unique set of opportunities for growth, and how the current size of the city allows for many projects and efforts to be feasible which may not be in larger cities. “I talk about Pittsburgh being an urban lab,” he said, describing in particular his vision of a system of child care which follows “a model of pre-K that goes all the way to prenatal,” and the development of after school programs and youth employment programs to adolescents “out of trouble and give them opportunities.”
“I want to make the steel city into the education city,” Peduto said.
Julia Eddy, junior social and decision sciences major and Senate and PSGC member, was happy to have the mayor speaking on campus: “PSGC has been difficult to keep established, so it’s nice to have him soliciting our opinion.”
She added that she was “really excited to have him at Senate.”
Thursday morning, however, Mayor Peduto canceled his appearance at the Senate meeting due to “unexpected events,” according to the official Facebook post for the event. 
Instead, Kevin Acklin, the mayor’s chief of staff and chief development officer was initially scheduled to fill in, but then also canceled due to what the page called “unforeseeable circumstances and a miscommunication within the Mayor’s office.”
Junior information systems major and Senate chair Evan Wineland said that he would be reaching out to the mayor’s office to try and reschedule the visit. This visit would have been the mayor’s first time speaking to Senate.
Wineland said that the mayor would have spoken about “connections between CMU and the greater Pittsburgh community,” and trying to “bridge a gap between the two.”

Later this month, Carnegie Mellon community members will start to feel the impact of work on the Jared L. Cohon University Center (CUC) addition beyond the sights and sounds of construction on Forbes Avenue.
First, the CUC pools and lockers rooms will close on March 23 as part of efforts to renovate the building’s fitness facilities.
The closures represent one of many community-wide changes taking effect over the coming months as the CUC addition begins to take shape. The pool and locker room renovations embody phase four in current project development, according to the Campus Design and Facilities Development website, following the entry and exit modifications to the East End Campus Garage started in August and December.
According to Director of Athletics Josh Centor, construction is expected to be completed in August. He anticipates that the renovations will improve the experience for both competitive athletes and recreational community members.
Timeline and Projects
The pool will close March 23 to coincide with qualified Carnegie Mellon swimmers going to the 2015 NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships. In the meantime, a number of changes will take place within the facility. The orientation of the Equipment Desk will change, workers will add a family changing area, and the location of laundry services will also shift.
Other renovations will address the needs of student athletes specifically. Enhancements will be made to the varsity locker rooms, and a spectator balcony will be built in the pool area. The HVAC system in the pool area will also be overhauled to meet air quality requirements.
According to Centor, the goal is to complete renovations by Orientation Week at the end of August, with the entire project ideally spanning “a little shy of five months.”
Rationale
The push for renovation comes from a combination of competitive benchmarking and community needs, according to Centor. Comparable schools, such as the University of Chicago and Emory University, have spectator seating in their pools, while Carnegie Mellon currently does not.
Centor explained that a lack of spectator seating hampers community and family participation in sporting events. “It’s very difficult to have parents there with the competitive swimmers,” Centor said. “We feel this is an important [addition].”
Athletes are also strapped for space in the current facility. “They have to share lockers,” Centor said. “There’s no space.”
But the aim is to impact not only competitive athletes, but also community members. In addition to competitive events, the pool is also used for community swim lessons, recreational swim, club water polo, and intramural inner-tube water polo.
According to Assistant Director of Athletics for Instructional Programs and Recreation Sara Gauntner, on average, Carnegie Mellon’s fitness facilities see 900 to 1,000 ID swipes on a given day. Frequently visited spaces include the pool, fitness centers, GroupX classes, gymnasiums, and the tennis and racquetball courts.
The idea is to “hopefully maximize the experience of our patrons, which is first and foremost,” Centor said.
Alternative Community Spaces
While the closure is in effect, community members accustomed to using the CUC fitness facilities can expect to change their routines. But the athletics department has worked to make alternative spaces available so patrons can maintain their desired level of fitness.
“We understand there’s going to be a disruption in their pattern of behavior,” Centor said. “We’ve made accommodations to ease that burden as best we can.”
Starting March 23, the CUC check-in desk will move up to the landing. Meanwhile, GroupX classes will still run, and Wiegand Gymnasium and Skibo Gymnasium will remain open.
Centor also notes that as the weather improves, the demand for indoor exercise facilities may go down. “In April, it might not be such a big deal to finish your work over there and walk over [to Skibo Gymnasium] to shower,” Centor said. “In June, people can go outside and take a run or take a walk.”
However, these alternatives still leave patrons without access to a competitive-sized pool.
The department has reached out to local partners for support. According to Gauntner, sponsors include Chatham University, the Jewish Community Center in Squirrel Hill, Club One, LA Fitness in Bakery Square, Chris Anthony Fitness, X Shadyside, the Thelma Lovette YMCA, and Kingsley Association, with pool access available at all but Chris Anthony Fitness and X Shadyside. Some of these facilities will be accessible for free, while others may charge an entrance fee.
After Memorial Day, outdoor pools will open for the summer, presenting an opportunity for local outdoor swimming memberships at Carnegie Mellon partner facilities.
“We thought [the pool] was probably the most significant part of our shutdown,” Centor said. “We’re grateful that our local partners are helping us.”
Vision
According to Centor, the fitness-oriented renovations are closely tied with the vision of the CUC addition as a whole: providing an enhanced community space to improve the outside-classroom experience.
“We are making a wonderful investment in our fitness facilities with the CUC addition,” Centor said. “We’ll create a conducive environment for our students, staff, and faculty to come together and be well.”
Another result of the CUC expansion will be the addition of two more fitness studios, and one studio dedicated to spinning. Currently, the CUC only hosts one studio — a situation that proves restrictive when scheduling fitness classes, as only one class can take place at a time. The availability of multiple studios will allow the department to stagger class schedules, offering more classes at more convenient times for students, staff, and faculty.
Fitness is by no means the singular focus of the expansion. In particular, a large proportion of the new facility space will be dedicated to student performance. However, Centor said that every feature of the addition, fitness-oriented or not, is designed to serve the same community-wide goal.
“The studio theater goes hand in hand with the fitness center,” Centor said. “It’s a student focused project — or rather, it will dramatically impact student experience outside the classroom.”
A breakdown of project phasing, construction timelines, and other details on the CUC addition are available at the Campus Design and Facility Development website.
“We’ve been talking about things for a while, but now things are happening,” Centor said. “I just think it’s going to be so awesome.”

Alumni make donations to Tepper Quadrangle
Carnegie Mellon recently received $17 million in donations from three different sources to support the construction of the Tepper Quadrangle and the nascent Presidential Fellowships and Scholarships Initiative.
Carnegie Mellon trustee James E. Rohr and his wife, Sharon, as well as Legendary Entertainment, founded and chaired by trustee Thomas Tull, made a donation to the upcoming Tepper Quadrangle construction project.
Alumnus Wallace Sadauskas and the estate of his late partner, Patricia Chotiner Traylor, gave to the President Fellowships and Scholarships Initiative.
“The university is committed to attracting and supporting outstanding students from around the world, and offering them an innovative education that takes advantage of CMU’s path-breaking research and practice across disciplines,” President Subra Suresh said in a university press release. “These gifts help fulfill this fundamental vision.”
The university announced these gifts at an event in California last Thursday, “Integrated Intelligence: San Francisco and Beyond,” during which President Subra Suresh, alumni, students, and faculty spoke about the future of machine learning.
Statistics Department among fastest growing
The American Statistical Association (ASA) recently featured Carnegie Mellon in its magazine in an article about how the university’s statistics department keeps students engaged in the growing field of statistics.
Carnegie Mellon’s statistics department is one of the fastest growing in the nation. Since 2010 the number of statistics majors at Carnegie Mellon has doubled; since 2005 it has grown 20-fold.
“The Statistics Department — and indeed Carnegie Mellon as a whole — exhibits an ethos that values and benefits from true interdisciplinary work,” said Christopher R. Genovese, head of the statistics department in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, in a university press release. “Our undergraduate curriculum builds on this by offering authentic engagement with interdisciplinary problems and extensive experience with the analysis of real data. (We have no ‘textbook’ datasets after the introductory courses.) I think this is a key to both the recent growth and the continuing demand for our courses.”
The ASA cites statistics as the most rapidly growing field that falls under the umbrella of Science, Technology, Math, and Engineering (STEM), outpacing even computer-related fields.

Defiant Tresspass, Theft
Feb. 26, 2015
A Carnegie Mellon student reported that around 11:58 p.m. he was approached by a black female in her forties outside of the Residence on Fifth. The woman asked for cash so that she could buy gas, tend to her ailing mother in the hospital, and get a babysitter for her child, who was in the back seat of the woman’s car. The student withdrew $60 from the ATM on Fifth Avenue and the woman gave him a ride to Cathedral Mansions, promising to pay him back.
This incident is similar to several others, in which a known individual scams students with similar stories. University Police urges students in similar situations to call the police immediately and not give out any money.

As Pittsburgh weather approaches record low temperatures this month, public and private schools across the Steel City have been forced to delay the start of school, or else close entirely. Yet colleges are a different story, and that story needs to change.
Carnegie Mellon sits among a number of Pittsburgh colleges and universities that rarely shut their doors when the temperature gets too low. The university last cancelled classes in February 2010 for three days after the city recommended that campuses close due to massive amounts of snow. “It is never an easy decision to cancel classes, and it is rare that we do so,” said Michael Murphy, vice president for campus affairs at that time, in an interview with The Tartan.
But as the city once more combats a slew of unforgiving conditions, it is important that colleges in the area consider safety over other components of the decision-making process, such as the need to make up classes or individual costs to students and the university.
A simple examination of college student travel habits at Carnegie Mellon alone presents reason for students to remain in their own residences during unforgivingly cold or slippery days. Many undergraduate and graduate students living off-campus live too close to the university to justify using buses, but walk considerably more than high school students.
Even students living on campus often live in relatively distant locations, such as Webster Hall Apartments, Fairfax Apartments, and the Residence on Fifth. The icy walkways and negative wind chills make for dangerous travel conditions as they walk to class. While professors can cancel classes themselves due to inclement weather, the likelihood that all of a student’s professors will cancel classes is low, pressuring the student to attend classes when they should not travel.
As Carnegie Mellon, as well as other nearby universities, endures the record chills, the university must rethink its approach to canceling classes. While closings may cost the school and alter syllabi, removing the pressure from students to attend classes would also remove the pressure to travel in unsuitable conditions.

The practice of journalism encourages cynicism. Journalists internalize a philosophy of "question everything; trust no one; dig up the muck," which suits their vocation well enough on a day-to-day basis, but promises storm clouds and hellfire for the future. 
The common assumption is that journalism is dying. Revenue and circulation of print newspapers are at an all-time low and declining, especially since their core readership (the 55+ crowd) is literally dying off. Established "legacy" news sources are downsizing their offices and laying off staff, forced to compete for the public's limited attention with the blogosphere — their arch-nemesis. According to the cynics, the Internet itself sounds the death knell of "true" journalism. Everything from discussion boards to Twitter feeds to especially Buzzfeed is a fatal threat signaling that people have forgone hard-hitting, unbiased, well-sourced journalism for its polar opposite: a discordant McFlurry of untrustworthy voices with click-bait fluff sprinkled on top.
The picture may not be so bleak as it originally appears. Maybe sites like Buzzfeed are the future of journalism, but is that really the end of the world? 
Buzzfeed calls itself a "social news and entertainment company" with "the most shareable" content that's "redefining online advertising with its social, content-driven publishing technology." Buzzwords aside (let's pretend that pun was intentional), its business model is innovative and overwhelmingly successful. The site has had over 13 million unique visitors in the last 24 hours alone, compared to [ITAL]USA Today[ITAL], the top United States newspaper in combined print and digital circulation, which has a 3.3 million daily circulation. Buzzfeed is also valued at $850 million, with a projected 2014 revenue of $120 million.
Over two-thirds of revenue in the news industry comes from advertising, but one of the reasons Buzzfeed is so profitable is because it has mastered the art of native advertising, or creating ads disguised as original content. If innovation in advertising is essentially finding new ways to trick consumers, native advertising is the Frankenstein's monster of innovation. It's smart (while less than .1 percent of site visitors are dumb enough to click on a banner ad, a much larger percentage will read an article entitled "Which Food Network All-Star Would Be Your Mentor?" (sponsored by Buzzfeed's "Publishing Partner," The Food Network), and it may even be designed to be beautiful (like this hilarious cat litter ad), but it's is also more than a little terrifying. 
John Oliver gives a thorough run-down of the risk native advertising runs in breaking down the wall between the business and editorial ends of the news industry that is integral to the journalism's integrity. However, as long as ads are clearly recognizable as ads (via appropriate labeling and disclaimers), and as long as their quality stays comparable to organic content, it's possible that native ads might be a win-win situation for both producers and consumers of news media. If no one is willing to pay for news in the digital era (and they're really not), then native advertising seems to be the most entertaining, most sustainable incarnation of a necessary evil. 
In addition to having such a solid source of revenue, Buzzfeed has also harnessed the Millennial generation more successfully than any other news media. 50 percent of the site's visitors fall within the 18-34 demographic, and considering that 68 percent of Millennials get news primarily from social media, it's unsurprising that 50 percent of Buzzfeed's traffic is mobile and 70 percent is from Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and so on. 
Buzzfeed's series of YouTube channels are almost a separate entity, posting infuriatingly entertaining, "tasty" videos several times weekly (I particularly recommend "Guys Try On Ladies Underwear for the First Time" and that series of people tasting gross things). Scoff all you want, but Buzzfeed's YouTube has attracted 9 million subscribers and 500 million monthly video views (doubtless earning Buzzfeed a pretty penny in addition to its advertising revenue). Buzzfeed also has a tech team of over 100 (one-fifth of its total staff), further emphasizing that the company has directed its priorities toward the future. Holding the secret of infinitely shareable content in the palm of its digital hand, Buzzfeed has made itself ubiquitous (to college students at least).   
Of course, the biggest objection to Buzzfeed as a model for journalism's future is the fact that, well, it's all meaningless clickbait junk, isn't it? But that's not exactly true. While the lists of "relatable" Taylor Swift and cat gifs may keep it popular and profitable, Buzzfeed has increasingly focused its resources on serious journalism. It has made a habit of hiring away celebrated journalists from established papers, including current Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith from Politico and Pulitzer Prize-winning ProPublica reporter Mark Schoofs. News articles take up a decent chunk of Buzzfeed's homepage and the Buzzfeed News page is cleaner and better organized than that of The Huffington Post. 
Additionally, Buzzfeed has committed itself to diversity, with an impressive near-even gender divide across their staff and the stated goal of improving their racial demographic through "aggressive hiring." By highlighting and amplifying minority voices, Buzzfeed is able to consistently produce content more interesting, original, and relevant to a younger demographic than that of many established news media sources (staffed primarily with middle-aged, heterosexual, white men). 
Buzzfeed is innovative, highly profitable, and — believe it or not — it may just be the future of journalism. If everyone decided to be a little less pretentious, that may not be such a tragedy. Personally, I like to top off my in-depth news pieces with a few cat videos.

During a January strategic planning town hall, Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno asked a packed room, "How can we maintain our excellence in all domains while ensuring a commitment to wellness for all campus members?” 
Of course, this question has been discussed many times in many forms since I arrived on Carnegie Mellon's campus, but until that town hall, I had never seriously considered any proposed solutions to this problem.
Why? Simply because many solutions to the question of balancing wellness and work do not seem feasible. Asking students to better manage their time or to take more free time for themselves places a large onus on students.
As hardworking individuals who were accepted by Carnegie Mellon because of our undeniable work ethic, it seems almost unfeasible to ask students to go against their instinct and chance not performing well — whether it be on a project or test — in exchange for some downtime or consistently full nights of sleep.
Hence why town hall attendee Jim Lawrence's suggestion that Carnegie Mellon nix the option to overload on courses has stuck with me for almost a month after the town hall.
During the meeting, Lawrence stated that at Harvard University, most students take four classes, or 16 credits. There is no standard option for students to overload. In fact, when one student took six classes in 2011, the [ITAL]Harvard Crimson[ITAL] found it so unusual that they wrote an entire story on his experience that semester. Quite a different culture from the culture on our campus, huh?
If students at Harvard find their classes aren't challenging enough during the semester, the Ivy League students are encouraged to do something else with their time. While students can still easily overwork themselves with extracurricular activities, it is notable that they cannot overwork themselves with additional classes. As Carnegie Mellon looks to define its path over the next few years, administrators and the wider campus community should seriously consider Lawrence's suggestion to do away with overloading.
While the suggestion will in no way cause all students to immediately more evenly distribute downtime and work time, the solution could work toward fixing numerous problems. For one, students would be forced to find new ways to fill their time that they had not previously explored. 
The lack of an option to fill time with more units could lead to students doing something that is arguably more enjoyable than mandatory coursework, unless they're among those rare people who truly enjoy extra assignments throughout the week over a dance class, painting session, or time with friends. While many students already do these things even with a full course load, imagine how many more of these activities they could do, or how much sleep and exercise they could balance with coursework and extracurricular activities as well.
If students couldn't overload, it could fight the notion that students need to constantly push themselves to work more and graduate as quickly as possible. If there is no suggestion online that a student merely agree upon the units they're overloading on with their advisers, students may be less tempted to do more work. When students are given the option to overload, it enforces the notion that we always need to do more. The decision to cut overloading could signal to students that their energy spent toward extra classes could be better spent on other facets of their wellness.
Of course, the idea to cut out overloading was contested at the town hall meeting and is sure to be contested by many campus members at large if it ever receives serious consideration. Their arguments are valid: Students should have the option to take what they want.
But when our mindset is to achieve, do we seriously consider the benefits of extra free time that we could be using instead of attending an extra class? If we have always taken more classes than needed, have we ever tested the benefits of a few extra hours of mindless relaxation or self-endeavors into things like weekend road trips or full afternoons off just to draw and read for pleasure during the semester?
Caroline Acker, head of the history department and also in attendance at the town hall, noted that professors expend a significant amount of energy investing in a student. When a student drops, the professor fails too. So why not make it harder for students to drop classes on a whim simply because they have added a built-in backup at the beginning of the semester? The lack of an overload option could benefit not only students, but professors as well.
And this is not to say that there would be no exceptions. Students needing extra courses to graduate on time or take certain courses in a particular semester to keep up with a sequence should not be punished with an additional semester. However, for the majority of students who do not need these classes, their time could be spent elsewhere on lighter activities that cater to the mind and body.
It must also be pointed out that, by no means, do a majority of students overload. Therefore, this option would not affect many students. However, it could greatly benefit a subset of the campus that is hooked on units. And it could lessen in the rest of us the need to always feel as though we need to do more.

According to the latest Washington Post-ABC News polls, President Obama currently has an approval rating of around 50 percent. This is extremely close to the 49.4 percent approval rating of George W. Bush, following a consistent pattern with the approval rating of previous leaders. In comparison, CNN reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin has a high approval rating of 86 percent. This wide gap raises many questions, particularly: How is the approval rating of a country's leaders determined by its nation?
Media networks paint a melancholy image of a low approval rating, but when examined closely, it may not be all that bad. In addition to Putin’s high rating, Political Research Quarterly reported that the average person in Beijing supported the government at around eight points on a 10-point scale. Are the governments of these nations that much better than the American government? By many measurements, the answer is completely opposite.  
It would be a lie to state that our government lacks problems. However, it can be safely stated that Americans have more freedom of speech and expression than citizens from nearly any other nation in the world. This freedom has given Americans the ability to speak their mind when they approve or disapprove of those running the nation. In countries like Russia and China, many citizens are afraid to speak their minds. Instead of true satisfaction, fear may steer their vote of approval.
However, an even more likely conclusion to the differing approval rating between America, Russia and China is the deep integration of debate and political opposition in American society. America’s private news networks often criticize those currently in power, whereas the ones in Russia and China have more centralized media on which insulting the leader would be unheard of.
In all honestly, a lower approval rating for Obama would not be a bad thing. No matter who is in power, the approval of American leadership most often lingers around 50 percent. This is because the nation has become divided by partisan lines and many people have quit thinking for themselves, instead allowing powerful liberal and conservative television networks to think for them. Other political thoughts have been thrown to the sidelines, so people often feel no other choice but to join one side or the other.
An approval rating tells as much about a nation as its leader. If a country has too low of an approval rating, such as Greece’s 14 percent approval rating, it becomes instantly clear that the nation has fallen to economic turmoil or some other disasters. In contrast, too high an approval rating signals obstructions in the way citizens think. It is impossible for a government to truly please everyone in the nation, and the only way to get a nearly perfect approval rating is through force or suppressing free speech.  
The approval rating of the United States or any other nation is not an accurate picture of how a leader is doing. More accurately, it is a measurement of how a nation is doing. An approval rating cannot simply be “good” or “bad.” A truly free nation must aim for itself to fall within a realistic range at which people are still free to think for themselves.

Last Sunday’s Academy Awards, the whitest Oscars in almost 20 years, struck a political chord. Noteworthy moments included host Neil Patrick Harris’s opening quip welcoming “the best and whitest ... I mean brightest,” Fashion Police host Giuliana Rancic’s comment that Zendaya’s dreadlocks “smelled like patchouli oil” or “weed,” Patricia Arquette’s call for wage equality, and Common and John Legend’s speech after winning the Best Original Song Oscar for “Glory.” 
Harris’ joke demonstrated awareness of a broader systematic problem — namely, the 94 percent white, 76 percent male, and averaged age 63 Academy — while also allowing the people who are the source of the problem to brush off any responsibility to change with a self-deprecating laugh.
Meanwhile, on Instagram, Zendaya called out Rancic’s comments as “outrageously offensive,” adding that her goal was “to showcase [dreadlocks] in a positive light, to remind people of color that our hair is good enough.” Rancic’s damage-control apology was surprisingly graceful, taking personal responsibility for having done wrong (as opposed to an “I’m sorry if you got hurt” cop-out) and admitting to have “learned a lot” from the incident about not perpetuating damaging stereotypes. Though Rancic’s career may never recover (fellow Fashion Police host Kelly Osborne has already resigned in protest), Zendaya has demonstrated her status as role model for women-of-color everywhere. 
Arquette’s call “to every woman who gave birth to every taxpayer and citizen of this nation” that “it is our time to have wage equality once and for all and equal rights for women in the United States of America,” earned enthusiastic cheers from the audience, but also represented the kind of watered-down feminism that is easy to support in theory but provides no useful path for change.
In contrast, Common and John Legend’s acceptance speech for Best Original Song winner “Glory” (incidentally, this was the only award Selma took home) was perhaps the most powerful moment of the night. Legend’s statement that there are “more black men under correctional control today than were in slavery” was like a cold splash of water, and “’Selma’ is now because the struggle for justice is now,” seemed to bring the insulated awards ceremony starkly back to reality. 
Though this year’s Academy Awards featured more small steps than giant leaps, it brought up plenty of important conversations about race and gender that America needs to have and take real action to confront.

As a result of a bad batch of MDMA, 10 students and 2 guests from Wesleyan University in Connecticut were hospitalized for overdoses last weekend. The drug, usually called molly, is a form of ecstasy. It typically acts as a stimulant, though symptoms can be complicated when additives like ephedrine, caffeine, ketamine, or even “bath salts” are included.
The drug is popularly believed to be safer than other forms of ecstasy, though the  National Institute on Drug Abuse reports that MDMA use can result in hyperthermia (overheating the body to the point of shutting down organs). This is especially a risk at hot, crowded clubs or parties.
While the Wesleyan case shows some of the health risks of illicit drugs, the lack of drug education on college campuses is even more concerning. At Carnegie Mellon, drug education is limited to Orientation events and the required Alcohol EDU course online. Alcohol, not drugs, is the focus of both programs.
Though alcohol education is important, drug use is a reality about which students are often uninformed or misinformed. 
Of the four Wesleyan students who were arrested in association with the case, three are pursuing neuroscience majors, according to NBC. One is the leader of a campus group of Students for Sensible Drug Policy at Wesleyan.
While these students have received criticism because they “should have known better,” The Tartan will not speculate about their choices. Instead, we believe that drug education should be a higher priority on college campuses. The Carnegie Mellon Health Services page titled “Alcohol & Other Drugs” titled “Alcohol & Other Drugs” only includes information about alcohol, marijuana, and prescription drugs.
Advocating against the use of drugs is an easy stance for any university. The challenging, complex decision is to recognize the reality of drug abuse and promote real understanding about their effects.

You act impulsively and with flash. You are the first sign of the zodiac and your room reflects your youthful optimism and your love of taking chances with designs. 
Your colors: Bold reds and amber, used in moderation
You know what you like, and you're not about to change your mind. Your bedroom is a palace, decorated with finely tailored curtains, custom-made bedding, and fine silken sheets. 
Your colors: Modest neutral browns, rich roses and pinks
You prefer the beautiful and trendy. Being the sign of the twins, Geminis are hard to nail down when it comes to design. Luckily, you have fabulous taste. For the bedroom, think modern art with clean geometric lines. 
Your colors: Light airy yellows, greens, and blues
Your space is an emotionally appealing shell in which everybody can kick back. Don't forget to hang curtains to block out the light to which you're particularly sensitive. Leave a sacred place to hang family pictures. 
Your colors: Colors of the moon, such as whites, pearls, yellows, and periwinkles 
You're proud of your opinions and you aren't afraid of being the center of attention. In fact, you want everyone to adore you. Think bright and sunny like a day at the beach, then add a gilded mirror to admire that megawatt smile.
Your colors: Oranges, yellows, reds, and purples 
You work with others in a steady, dependable way — much like the design you aspire to. Guided by attention to detail, you consider every little detail in your design. Have a storage compartment for your shoes and accentuate with vases and candle holders. 
Your colors: Light blues, greens, creams, and whites
Libra is only sign of zodiac represented by an inanimate object, and your airy nature means you thrive in a conceptual environment. You have modern sensibilities — thin, breezy curtains and carefully curated art. 
Your colors: Pastels, airy greens, and blues
Scorpios feel very comfortable in their space. However, in your room you crave privacy, such as a muted lighting to create a cave-like feel and opaque curtains to allow just a glimpse of light in. 
Your colors: Spicy oranges, burgundies, and blacks
You have multiple different personalities, such as the Sagittarius freedom-seeker/traveler who likes to display his/her adventures, or the sensitive Sagittarius who would listen to everyone's problems. In every case, you crave comfort. Invest in big, fluffy pillows and a comfortable mattress. 
Your colors: Blues into lighter purples
You make your presence known without dominating, but come across grounded, solid and sturdy. Your sensibilities tend toward strong, solid basics like a wooden red-toned furniture and a sturdy leather chair. 
Your colors: Earth tones, purples, grays
You tend to impose your unique, forward-thinking ideas. You're a step ahead of the rest of us, especially when it comes to technology. Memory foam mattresses and the latest HDTV are a must when decorating your room. 
Your colors: Silver, blues, and denim
You're a go-with-the-flow type who needs your room to be a place where you can relax. Your bed is of high importance and must be soft, comfy and soothing. 
Your colors: Watery greens and blues, pale yellows moving toward whites
