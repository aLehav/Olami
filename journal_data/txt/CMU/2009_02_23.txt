As one of the six graduating Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball seniors, Elliott Curtis has been a significant part of one of the most successful squads in the program’s history. When Curtis isn’t dishing out assists for the Tartans, he stays busy with academics, as well as with teaching a stylish StuCo course called “Sneakerology” and working with his shoe and clothing line, vitaminTHICK. With hopes of postseason play in the near future, Curtis reflects on his basketball career and entrepreneurial endeavors with The Tartan.
The Tartan: Since this is your last basketball season, has there been any season in particular that meant a lot to you?
Curtis: Honestly, my seventh and eighth grade seasons for the Pierce School back in Brookline were probably my best. I was a star. When I got to high school, I was unwillingly transformed into a role player. Oh... you mean in college? This season has been the most meaningful by far.
T: If you could have had one part of growing up in the Boston area moved here, what would it be and why?
C: First off, and I think anybody reading this from the Boston area would agree with me, I definitely miss Anna’s Taqueria burritos. I rarely eat Qdoba and Chipotle because they are so greatly inferior to Anna’s. I would like to say, however, that Pittsburgh is an awesome city in terms of food. Wherever I end up next year, I will surely miss Fat Heads and Primanti’s. Other than that, the lack of Boston sports coverage is excruciating. Good thing all four major teams are amongst their respective leagues’ elites, so they get a fair amount of national coverage.
T: Your StuCo course, Sneakerology, has been getting some great press and has become popular. How would you hope to expand this class in the future if you had the chance? 
C: Teaching Sneakerology with my buddy Jesse [Chorng] has been an awesome experience. In the future, I would hope to offer the course at a university close to wherever I end up next year. That way, I might even get paid for teaching the class! But it’s not about the money.
T: Do you have an all-time favorite shoe? 
C: Definitely the Air Penny II in white and Atlantic blue. Penny Hardaway was my favorite player as a youngster, so I wore his number and bought his sneakers to wear while playing for my first basketball team in fourth grade. I just bought a retro version of the shoes in Carnegie Mellon colors, which I wore on senior day. It was my metaphorical sneaker statement of my playing career coming full circle, whatever that means.
T: Are there any recent or future developments for your shoe and clothing line? 
C: vitaminTHICK is coming along. I just got back from the MAGIC [not related to “The Gathering”] tradeshow in Las Vegas, which is one of the largest premium and urban fashion conventions in the world. It was a great learning experience and gave us some valuable insight into the future of the company. We have a great product selection for this spring, and there will for sure be some shirts available at Kicksburgh April 15 in Skibo Gym.
T: Where would you like to live after graduation to pursue a career or graduate school? 
C: Right now my plans are completely up in the air. If you haven’t heard, the economy is down from years past, so finding a job might take a little longer than planned. I would be fine with living on a trundle bed in Ry-Dude’s [Ryan Einwag] apartment in Chicago — Terrance [Bouldin-Johnson] already shottied the couch — or maybe on a hammock outside of Greg Gonzalez’s beach-front property in Puerto Rico.
T: How is your experience with the new podcast feature aired by our sports information department? 
C: Recording “Two the Point” with Corey [O’Rourke] has been a lot of fun. Our listeners span from our moms to, well, our dads. But if anyone reading this is interested, check out the Athletics website for our weekly episodes of entertainment. I must say though, my back is getting a little tired from carrying the show.
The Tartans will be finishing out their regular season play this Saturday at the University of Rochester.

The journey to Chicago for the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships was a chance for the Carnegie Mellon swimming and diving teams to showcase their hard work and talent among some of the best competition in the country. Both the men and women returned to Pittsburgh with top-three team finishes and many individuals sporting medals. The men finished second out of eight with a score of 1533.5, 161 away from champion Emory University. The women finished third out of eight with a final score of 1060, placing just behind Emory and New York University. Many of the Carnegie Mellon swimmers recorded provisional NCAA qualifying times and will most likely make the trip to the national tournament this year, which will be held March 18–21 at the University of Minnesota.
In tandem with the team’s success, Tartans head coach Matt Kinney and assistant coaches Sara Gauntner and Brent Kintzer were recognized by the UAA as the best men’s coaching staff of the year; in addition, diving coach Alicia Gorman was recognized as the best men’s diving coach of the year.
Junior Matt Kuhn captured his second diving title off the 1-meter board. Kuhn was also honored as the men’s diver of the year by the UAA. First-year Mike Alexovich also placed off the 1-meter board, finishing third in the conference. Junior Jeff Dahlen captured first place in both the 100-yard and 200-yard backstroke and was also a member of the third-place 400-yard medley relay team and second-place 800-yard medley relay team.
Members of the 400-yard team included junior Jason Huber, senior Ryan Piper, and sophomore Joshua Mathews, and the team finished with a time of 3:26.40. The 800-yard team comprised of Dahlen, Matthews, junior Gates Winkler, and senior Tom McConnell finished with a time of 6:51.92.
McConnell recorded a number of finishes in addition to his successful relay. He was crowned UAA champion in the 1650-yard freestyle with a time of 15:41.56, a school and UAA record and NCAA automatic qualifying time. He also finished third in the 200-yard freestyle and in the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 4:30.91.
Teammate junior Jonas Altman-Kurosaki finished just behind McConnell in the 1650-yard freestyle by .71 seconds to claim second place overall. Junior Andrew Seo finished second in the 200-yard breaststroke with a school record time of 2:04.26. Claiming some more points for the Tartans was senior Ron Papa, who finished third behind Dahlen in the 200-yard backstroke.
Sophomore Molly Evans had four victories at the meet, placing in every event in which she competed. Evans had two individual second-place finishes in both the 200-yard backstroke (2:04.33) and the 200-yard freestyle (1:52.42), both of which were NCAA “A” qualifying times. She also recorded third in the 200-yard individual medley relay with a time of 2:07.92 and third in the 800-yard freestyle relay along with teammates junior Sara Andrews, first-year Victoria Adams, and senior Allison Retotar with a time of 7:38.78.
Andrews finished eighth in the 50-yard freestyle and claimed second place in 100-yard breaststroke with a time of 1:06.42. Sophomore Rebecca Ussai finished third in the 200-yard butterfly with a time of 2:09.60. She also took sixth in the 100-yard butterfly, earning more points for the Tartans. Adams and first-year Jen Sung also competed in the 200-yard butterfly, finishing one and two in the consolation heat. Seniors Tina Daup and Becky Martz competed in the 1650-yard freestyle, finishing 21st and 23rd. Andrews, Evans, Retotar, and sophomore Brianne Burton competed in the women’s 400-yard freestyle relay and had a fourth-place showing and a school record time of 3:33.86.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team has competed in four University Athletic Association (UAA) games over the past two weeks and finished with a 2–2 record. Two weeks ago, the Tartans hosted the Brandeis University Judges and the New York University Violets and this weekend, the team took on the Washington University in St. Louis Bears and the University of Chicago Maroons for the second time this season and split both weekends 1–1, with wins over NYU and Chicago. The Tartans are now 18–6 overall and 8–5 in UAA play.
Friday’s game was a constant battle for both teams, but the Judges were able to edge past the Tartans with a 66–63 victory. The Tartans started the game strong taking a commanding 10–3 lead, with six points coming from senior Terrance Bouldin-Johnson. The Judges stepped up their game and took their first lead of the half with 7:18 remaining to make the score 16–17. Brandeis controlled the rest of the half with a 26–31 lead entering the break. The visitors continued to lead the game after the break but after a powerful two-handed dunk from first-year John Durhing, the Tartans closed the gap to three. After the dunk, the Judges pulled away with seven straight points coming from Brandeis junior Andre Roberson giving them their biggest lead of the game at 44–54. The Tartans would not concede easily as junior Jack Anderson drained a three with only 15 seconds remaining. The Tartans had possession with 14 seconds remaining but senior Ryan Einwag’s three pointer did not fall.
The Tartans were more successful Sunday with a 79–73 victory over NYU. After a slow start and a 7–0 deficit, the home team rallied to control most of the first half. With 11:45 remaining, the Tartans took their largest lead of the game, 23–14. At the break, the Tartans led 37–35. NYU caught fire early in the second half to take a 49–46 lead, but the Tartans went on a 9–0 run to overcome the Violets, a lead that would last the game. Einwag led the team with a game-high 25 points followed by Anderson with 18.
Last Friday, the 25th-ranked Tartans took on second-ranked Washington University. The Bears started the game converting on 11–14 shots and continued the trend throughout the game defeating the Tartans 77–63. Anderson led the Tartans in the first half with 11 points and cut the Bears’ lead to nine entering the break. In the second half, the Tartans tightened the gap at 49–43 but they could not hold on as the Bears pulled away 56–43 with 12:18 remaining in the game. The Bears finished the game shooting 60 percent from the field while the Tartans were only 37.9 percent. Anderson led the Tartans with 16 points while sophomore Shane Rife added 11.
Last Sunday, the Tartans faced the University of Chicago Maroons in the windy city and came away with a 68–56 victory. The win marked the second time in UAA history that the Tartans have won at Chicago’s court. Neither team had a clear advantage in the first half with 12 lead changes in the first 15 minutes. It was not until senior Rob Pearson dropped in a lay up and initiated a 17–7 run for the Tartans with 5:13 remaining in the half. At the break, the Tartans led 37–28, and continued to control the floor for the first five minutes of the second half but a 13–4 run put the Maroons within four of the Cardinal and Gray. The Tartans answered with eight straight points and maintained the lead through the rest of the game. Einwag led the team with 25 points to put him second on the all time scoring chart for Carnegie Mellon with 1304 career points. Following Einwag, classmate Corey O’Rourke added a season high of 18.
The Tartans will end their regular season play next Saturday at the University of Rochester at 4 p.m.

Last Saturday at a local Monroeville sports facility, Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis picked up two victories, 9–0 over Division I Robert Morris University and 7–2 over Division II West Virginia Wesleyan College. Yesterday, the Tartans traveled to Oxford Athletic Club to host Division I Case Western Reserve University and come out on top with a decisive 9–0 score. These three wins bring the 14th-ranked Tartans to an overall 7–1 record.
For the second time this season, the Tartans were able to dominate Robert Morris, only this time they did not drop a single match. In the opening matches, the Tartans quickly gained a 3–0 lead by sweeping the doubles. The first doubles duo of sophomore Alex Nemerov and junior Ravi Raghavan clinched the first win 9–7, followed by junior Jon Spero and senior Yiran Liu who closed out their opponents 8–4. Like their teammates, sophomore Bobby Mactaggart and junior Niko Ljuboja wasted no time in dropping only three games to grab an 8–3 victory.
During singles play, junior James Muliawan defeated his opponent 6–3, 6–3. At second singles, Nemerov had a bit of trouble but battled it out to win 6–7(4), 6–2, 10–5. MacTaggart picked up a 6–4, 6–4 victory followed by Raghavan at fourth singles 6–1, 6–1.
Against West Virginia Wesleyan, the Tartans faced tougher opponents but were able to pull out a 7–2 win. The duo of Nemerov/Raghavan fell to their opponents 8–6, but the team of Spero/Liu and MacTaggart/Ljuboja won both of their matches, 8–3 and 8–6, to put the Tartans ahead 2–1. At first singles, Muliawan fell in a long battle, 4–6, 6–3, 10–8. At second singles, Nemerov was able to redeem himself with an easy 6–1, 6–1 victory, followed by a win from Mactaggart 6–2, 6–2. Spero also snatched a 6–4, 6–2 victory for the Tartans.
The next day the Tartans were able to repeat their strong performance by defeating Case Western Reserve 9–0. In doubles, Nemerov/Raghavan won 8–2, followed by the pairs of Liu/Spero and Mactaggart/Ljuboja who contributed 8–6 victories each. In singles, the Tartans proved to be just as lethal, with Muliawan winning 6–2, 6–4 and Nemerov dominating with score 6–2, 6–2. MacTaggart defeated his opponent 4–6, 6–4, 10–3.
The Tartans have free time before they travel to Claremont, Calif. for a five match run over spring break.

The Carnegie Mellon track and field teams participated in the indoor Bucknell Winter Classic two weekends ago and competed in the unscored Kent State Tune-up indoor track meet last Saturday. 
The Kent State Tune-up was an important meet for a several runners who were still trying to qualify for the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships.
At Bucknell, both the men and women faced tough competition that consisted of Division I, II, and III schools. While the men’s team dominated the long distance races, the women’s team saw several standout performances overall.
For the men, senior Brian Harvey easily led the team with a first-place finish in the 5000-meter run with a time of 14:50.85. Behind Harvey, sophomore J.P. Allera took second with a time of 15:25.60.
In the one-mile run, senior Ryan Anderson placed first with a time of 4:21.08. First-year Rob Morhard finished in a close second with a time of 4:23.66. In the 3000-meter run, junior Dario Donatelli took fourth with a time of 8:47.52. Sophomore Josh Eichmeier and first-year Matt Jacob finished 13th (9:02.24) and 17th (9:08.53), respectively.
“Due to a lack of pacing help from the field, I missed my goal by about four to five seconds,” said Anderson. “The win was nice, but I would have been happy with 10th [place] and a better time.”
Sophomore Nate Bussiere had a solid day, finishing fourth in the 800-meter run with a time of 1:59.10. While junior Chris Bridgman took second in the pole vault with 4.35 meters, first-year Ryan Kissel jumped for 6.53 meters in the long jump to take fourth-place overall. Sophomore Pat O’Brien finished fourth in the triple jump with 12.90 meters.
In the 500-meter run, junior Chris Bogie placed fifth overall with a time of 1:07.85. Senior Craig Hahn finished 10th in the 60-meter hurdles with a time of 8.76.
Junior James Hulley threw for 15.46 meters to take third in the shot put. First-year Anthony Hernandez (14.51 meters) and senior Chris Fornataro (13.94 meters) finished 12th and 15th, respectively in the weight throw.
For the women, first-year Ivana Moses broke the school record in the triple jump to finish fourth overall with 11.07 meters. First-year Chelsea Grindle continued to improve, finishing seventh in the long jump with 5.10 meters.
In the 400-meter race, junior Diane Mattingly finished 19th overall with a time of 1:04.25. First-year Liz Stern also had a good performance, finishing 10th in the one-mile run with a time of 5:28.55. Sophomore Courtney Baker had one of her best performances, taking fifth place in the 800-meter run with a time of 2:22.76.
“For me, the one-mile run is so different than a cross country race — I’m still getting used to the indoor track mentality of being able to gauge giving your all in a shorter race,” said Stern.
Carnegie Mellon continued its success last Saturday at the Kent State meet in preparation for conference finals.
Bogie led the men’s team with a second-place finish in the 300-meter hurdles with a time of 39.27. Hahn followed to finish eighth with a time of 40.71.
In the one-mile run, Harvey and Anderson finished with strong performances, taking second (4:14.26) and sixth (4:17.22), respectively. Harvey also took 19th in the 800-meter run with a time of 1:57.08. Bussiere finished 29th with a time of 1:59.70.
In the long distance races, Donatelli and Jacob took 11th (15:05.67) and 22nd (15:33.22), respectively. Allera and Morhard placed 20th (8:53.64) and 24th (8:59.85), respectively.
Hulley threw for 15.15 meters to finish ninth in the shot put while Fornataro took 20th in the weight throw with 14.43 meters. Sophomore Mike Tomovich finished 16th in the triple jump with 12.41 meters.
The women’s team faced some notable injuries, but the underclassmen stepped up for a solid meet. Fresh off her record-breaking performance last week, Moses continued to excel in the triple jump with 10.88 meters. Grindle followed with 10.53 meters to take 11th.
In the 3000-meter run, Stern put up a strong race, finishing seventh with a time of 10:40.42. Baker and sophomore Laura McKee took ninth and 20th overall in the 800-meter run with times of 2:22.88 and 2:27.16, respectively.
Junior Timi Abimbola and senior Emily Giacomarra took 14th (47.15) and 15th (48.09) overall in the 300-meter dash.
“I definitely think our team is much better this year,” said junior Crystal LeePow. “The underclassmen are really good. The new and the old members of the team need to step it up to perform well at the UAA.”
The Tartans will prepare for next weekend’s indoor UAA Championships at New York University.

Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis hosted Robert Morris University and Case Western Reserve University Sunday at the Oxford North Athletic Club. The Tartans used momentum from their three shutouts two weekends ago and barreled over their opponents, once again not losing a single set to either school en-route to two shutout victories. Junior Alisa Liebowitz led the way, not losing a single game to her opponents from either school.
Against Division I Robert Morris Univerity , the Tartans got off to a roaring start, sweeping the doubles. Tartan sophomore Ashley Herrick and first-year Laura Chen got the ball rolling, defeating Robert Morris’ Kali Delorie and Katerina Rudneva, 8–1. The teams of sophomore and first-year duos Kelly Hart/Courtney Chin and Jennifer Chui/Cze-Ja Tam followed with 8–0 and 8–1 victories, respectively.
Chen then started off the singles by defeating Delorie, 6–1, 6–1. Chui and Hart followed, also not dropping a set en-route to their victories before Liebowitz netted the first of her two shutouts, defeating Gwen Dalphon, 6–0, 6–0. Tam also swept Robert Morris’ Sara Meier while sophomore Danielle Rosenfeld won her match as well.
“The women played well today,” said head coach Andy Girard. “I think we are close to where we want to be for the ITA Indoor National Championships next week.”
Against Case Western Reserve, Herrick and Chen again kicked off the dominance, winning their doubles match, 8–0. Tam and Chui followed with an 8–1 victory before the Tartans won the third doubles match by default.
Chin then began the singles by overwhelming Case Western Reserve’s Marta Warwag, 6–0, 6–0 before Hart and Tam each won their matches, 6–1, 6–1. Liebowitz followed with her second shutout of the day before Rosenfeld won, 6–1, 6–0 and the Tartans won the last match by default to seal the victory.
“We’re going to have an all-out intrasquad battle this week at practice and that should be the final piece we need [for the tournament],” said Girard. “Everyone’s looking forward to participating in the inaugural indoor national championships. It should be a lot of fun. We are the 5th seed going into it so not much is expected of us, but if we play to our potential maybe we can surprise some people.”
The Tartans will participate in the ITA tournament, hosted by Gustavus Adolphus College from Friday through Sunday.

After a University Athletic Association (UAA) conference doubleheader on the road, the Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team dropped two decisions to their hosts, falling 78–58 to the 12th-nationally ranked Washington University in St. Louis Bears on Friday and 76–48 to the University of Chicago Maroons on Sunday. The team’s record now stands at 5-19 overall and 0–13 in conference play.
Two weeks ago, the team hosted the Judges of Brandeis University in front of a crowd of 225 in support of the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) Pink Zone event on Friday and played the Violets of New York University on Sunday in Skibo Gymnasium, but fell to the visitors 71–49 and 62–54, respectively. Carnegie Mellon battled the Judges in the first half, with two leads and three ties, and entered the break trailing behind Brandies 27–36. Brandeis picked up momentum to extend their lead on an 18–5 run, maintaining their double-digit lead to seal their 71–49 victory.
First-year Jacki Cortese contributed 14 points and nine rebounds, and senior Rachelle Roll chipped in 10 points and 10 rebounds to the Tartans’ score.
Despite the loss from two nights before, the Tartans rallied against the Violets on senior day with a 12–0 run in the first half, opened up by first-year Ali Aunkst and her back-to-back three-pointers and closed out by a fast-break lay-in from senior Colleen Light. The Tartans finished the half with a four-point lead. NYU came out of the lockers ready to play and edged the Tartans 39–34 after a 9–2 run. Carnegie Mellon was unable to surpass the Violets and trailed behind to close out the game with an eight-point deficit.
Last Friday in St. Louis, the first half proved to be a constant back and forth struggle between the Tartans and Washington University, as there were five lead changes and six ties. As the leading scorer in the half contributing nine points to the Tartans score, Cortese opened up the scoring with a layup in the initial seconds. However, Carnegie Mellon was unable to gain momentum, and the Bears surpassed the Tartans to maintain an edge of five points. It was not until the 10th minute that the Tartans equalized at 15–15 to convert a five-point deficit into a four-point advantage. Senior Stacie Aleski sank a three-pointer to jump start the Carnegie Mellon 11–2 run that contributed to the 21–17 lead. Once again though, the Bears came from behind to close out the half with a five point advantage at 33–28.
Wash. U. came out of the locker room ready to dominate the second half, extending their advantage to 50–33 with 15:15 remaining. Carnegie Mellon could not rally enough to close the 17 point margin as Wash. U. continued to widen the gap, putting away a total of 45 points in the second half, with a 20 point lead to finalize the victory.
Cortese led the Carnegie Mellon offense, recording a game-high 19 points (which she then broke Sunday, increasing to 20 points) and a team-high eight rebounds. Following Cortese, first-year Jen Larsen contributed eight points and sophomore Jessica Buranovsky has seven.
Yesterday’s game against the Maroons proved to be a disappointment for the Tartans and they headed back to Pittsburgh with another loss to their conference record. Carnegie Mellon struggled to sink any of its first 12 shots, but senior Corey Innes broke the dry spell with a three-pointer that unfortunately led to a nine-point run for Chicago. The Maroons continued to dominate the court as they expanded their lead to 39–17 before the break. As the teams entered the second half, the Tartans gave a better fight but the Maroons maintained possession and confirmed their 28-point edge over Carnegie Mellon to finalize the score at 76–48.
The Tartans conclude their season this Saturday when they hit the road to take on the University of Rochester. Game time is set for 2 p.m.

Why haven’t you skipped over this article already? This isn’t news!
But it’s Michael Phelps, the most accomplished swimmer in history. That makes him different and special. He was caught and admitted to having smoked pot before. Henceforth, the overall consensus is that he should be forever condemned for the fact that he perpetually smokes this performance-enhancing drug. Not only that, but kids idolizing Phelps will now begin to do it too, since it’s portrayed in such a good light.
Let us cast our minds back for a moment to November 2004, after the Athens Olympics, when 19 year-old Phelps was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. Not only was he underage, but he was engaging in an act that endangered other people on the road that night. Who knows what horrors could have happened; yet it was in the news for about a week and then was forgotten.
Fast forward to last month, when Phelps, fresh off the most successful Olympics in history, was seen in a picture smoking pot. Not only is pot illegal, but pot is most commonly used by people aged 18–25 and he was endangering nobody outside of the party — or inside it for that matter. Phelps subsequently lost a sponsorship from Kellogg’s and was suspended from USA Swimming for three months, but most aggravatingly has been victimized by the American public. An anonymous swimmer poll that I conducted revealed that 82.3 percent agreed that people are overreacting to the Phelps bong issue, and 73.3% agreed that the majority of people responding to the issue don’t actually care for swimming and are just looking for a target.
“It’s like finding a picture of the spelling bee champ playing video games,” said junior Tufts University swimmer Lawrence Chan. “Even if the kid’s a genius, he’s still a kid and is going to do stuff kids do. People should leave Phelps alone.”
“It’s hard to be a role model 24/7,” said junior Carnegie Mellon swimmer Gates Winkler. “He was just having a good time at a party after training hard for four years and having no life outside of swimming. Yes, I think Phelps is an idiot, not because he let down the people who idolize him, but because he shouldn’t do that kind of stuff to himself.”
While most swimmers, myself included, claimed to have never smoked pot, the two overall sentiments were that marijuana is a performance-debilitating drug, so if Phelps can do that and still win eight gold medals then so be it, and that if this were any other non-Olympic swimmer, no one would care. For example, if a bad rumor were to be made up about the American swimmer who got a silver medal at the Beijing Olympics, would the media care? Of course not. He didn’t win a gold. No one outside of swimming even remembers his name.
It was Saturday Night Live’s Seth Myers, though, who summed up the real issue: “If you are at a party and see Michael Phelps smoking a bong and your first thought isn’t, ‘Wow, I get to party with Michael Phelps,’ but instead you take a picture and sell it to the tabloids, you should take a long look in the mirror.”

This past Feb. 12 marked not only the birthday of Abraham Lincoln, but also the bicentennial of Charles Robert Darwin. Charles Darwin introduced the theory of evolution to the world 150 years ago and changed the way people view biological sciences today.
Darwin was born on Feb. 12, 1809, in Shrewsbury, England, as the fifth of six children. According to an article on the Complete Works of Darwin Online, Darwin was encouraged to become a physician just like his father. However, due to his inability to watch surgeries, his father sent him to Christs College in Cambridge in hopes that he would become a parson. While at Cambridge, such influential minds as William Whewell and John Stevens Henslow helped spark Darwin’s interest in natural history.
Before Darwin’s revolutionary theory, several other theories had been proposed. Prior to the 19th century, the accepted theory for the extinction of species was catastrophism. This theory declared that species were periodically wiped out due to natural catastrophes and were then replaced with brand new species. Then, in the early 19th century, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck introduced a new, radical idea that stated that every new generation inherits some characteristics from its ancestors. 
He advocated that the more an individual’s traits or organs are used, the more enhanced they become, and those that are not used become weakened or removed. These changes would then be passed on to their offspring. This, in a sense, set the stage for Darwin’s profound theory. However, Darwin was able to analyze samples that he collected to make a more thorough and convincing argument. Darwin’s most influential work came from his voyage on the H.M.S. Beagle. This expedition gave him an opportunity to study geological properties of the continents and collect a variety of living organisms and fossils from all over the world. 
In his book, On the Origin of Species, Darwin recollected, “When on board H.M.S. ‘Beagle,’ as naturalist, I was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the organic beings inhabiting South America, and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent. These facts ... seemed to throw some light on the origin of species — that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers.”
Upon his arrival back in England, Darwin conducted thorough research on the samples and notes he collected, and came to several theoretical conclusions. He believed that evolution did occur and that the change was gradual. He also recognized the primary mechanism of evolution as natural selection. 
Natural selection refers to the idea that the more advantageous traits, which better help an organism survive and subsequently reproduce, are the ones that are passed on and adapted in future generations. He also realized that millions of current species arose from a single original life form through a branching process called “speciation.” The book, Charles Darwin: His Life Told in an Autobiographical Chapter, and in a Selected Series of his Published Letters, states that Darwin’s conclusions about speciation came from his studies in the Galapagos Islands, where he noticed that 13 species of finches had adapted to different environmental roles. This was puzzling to him because he only knew of one species of finch in South America, where they had presumably originated. These finches differed in beak shape, food source, and methods of obtaining food. Thus, he concluded that all these species of finches had originated from a common ancestor. Alfred Russel Wallace, working on islands in the South Pacific, came up with ideas similar to those of Darwin. After completing a paper about ideas that mirrored Darwin’s, Wallace sent his paper to Darwin, with whom he had initiated a correspondence. However, Darwin’s colleagues encouraged him to publish his own ideas and on July 1, 1859, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection was released. This provoked some outraged responses from the Church because the theory of evolution conflicted with the Church’s belief that all creatures were created by God. Darwin, however, avoided talking about the theological and sociological aspects of his work.
Darwin’s theory of evolution holds that variation among species occurs randomly and the survival and extinction of an organism depends on that organism’s ability to adapt to its environment. As stated on www.darwin-literature.com, his  theory was based on five key observations. First, species have incredible fertility, so there are more offspring than adults in a species. Second, populations remain roughly the same size. Third, food resources are limited and may cause a struggle for survival among each organism. Fourth, variation is extensive in sexually reproducing species, and fifth, much of this variation is heritable. His concept of natural selection is that those with the “best” traits will be more likely to survive, and subsequently passed on to future generations. 
Darwin’s work was well supported by some scientists, such as Thomas Huxley, while others were hesitant to believe that organisms could inexplicably pass special qualities to their offspring (which was later proved to be possible through genetic materials). Although Darwin’s theory of evolution is still questioned by people, it has established itself in the biological community, while research is still being conducted to further examine his theory.

Unfortunately for those seeking counsel from him, Darwin is dead. However, for the occasion of the naturalist’s 200th birthday, a multidisciplinary team of biologists, computer scientists, and artists have resurrected the man — in the form of an exhibit at the Carnegie Science Center.
Charles Darwin’s avatar, portrayed by Carnegie Mellon drama alumnus Randy Kovitz, stands by the hearth in his home, clearly anxious for the interview to get underway. A console in front of him allows viewers to pose him any of a list of questions, covering topics from his voyage on H.M.S. Beagle to his family life, from his theory of natural selection to his religious views.
The answers come from primary sources, extrapolated from his many articles and journal entries. But some of the questions deal with subjects or events that Darwin could not have known about, and for these questions contemporary scientists are called upon to give their opinions.
The exhibit is the result of a collaboration between the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) and Duquesne University. The exhibit uses Synthetic Interview technology developed by Scott Stevens, a senior systems scientist with the ETC and the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, and Mike Christel, also a senior systems scientist with the ETC.
The technology leverages a large number of prerecorded answers to questions. When a user poses a question, the system finds the most similar question in its database and plays back the corresponding answer. 
This allows any person to have a mostly fluent conversation with a figure who, either due to a busy schedule or death, is inaccessible.
The advantage of synthetic interview technology over a simple video recording is that since the user controls the discourse, he can immediately address any questions that are bothering him. The end result, the creators of the technology believe, is a more satisfied user.
One of the creators of the exhibit is John Pollock, an associate professor in Duquesne University’s Bayer School of Natural and Environmental Sciences.
“People in the time of Darwin understood breeding through agriculture,” Pollock said. “Darwin’s insight was unique in that he came up with the mechanism of natural selection.” Before the contributions of Darwin and other naturalists, the large diversity of species had no satisfactory explanation.
Pollock’s work in the past has encouraged the observational instinct — the instinct that enabled Darwin to make his discoveries and that anyone can cultivate. Pollock helped in the planning of a garden in the Phipps Conservatory, which plants kale, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts together, laying bare to the eye the common ancestry of these household vegetables.
Recently, Pollock’s funding for these educational ventures stems from the National Center for Research Resources and the National Institute of Health.
According to a press release from the School of Computer Science, the Darwin synthetic interview is in the process of being adapted to the web. The creators also hope to bring further versions of the exhibit to other museums across the country.

The Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT) is known for working its students hard, but this year’s first annual technology showcase, which displayed 12 student engineering projects, showed that all those sleepless nights of coding, soldering, and nervous breakdowns were well worth the effort.
The Tech Showcase was part of the annual National Engineer’s Week, which was hosted by the Society of Women Engineers (SWE). The showcase was a new addition to this year’s E-Week events. “The Tech Showcase aims to celebrate the exciting and innovative research and technologies being developed by engineers,” Christine Ho, a senior chemical and biomedical engineering major and co-chair for E-Week, said. “It is an opportunity for students in CIT as well as students in the other colleges to explore the many ways in which engineering is changing the world.” The showcase represented projects from all different disciplines and organizations within Carnegie Mellon.
The three senior capstone projects that were displayed included a gesture recognition glove called “Hand Talk,” a fold-out toaster, and an iPod-charging exercise bike. “Hand Talk” is a project developed by electrical and computer engineering alumnus Bhargav Bhat and fifth-year electrical and computer engineering master’s students Hemant Sikaria and Jorge Meza. The device is aimed to help individuals who have hearing impairments to better communicate with other people. By wearing a glove with embedded sensors, an individual is able to make a gesture that is then transmitted to a cell phone as text.
“The cool thing about our project is that there are a lot [of] these types of gloves out there, but ours is the only one which is wireless,” Meza said. The technology behind the glove is currently being researched in regard to obtaining a patent. “Hand Talk” won the “Most Innovative Design” award at the showcase.
The fold-out toaster, developed by senior mechanical engineering students Akshay Jayaram, Leigh Fortenberry, Ian Price, and Jonathan Goetteler, is a modification of the current toaster design. 
After conducting user studies, the group found that people often have trouble removing their toast from the toaster, causing them to burn their toast, themselves, or both. In order to solve this problem, they designed a toaster in which the side walls open up and out. “We think that this is a very innovative design, and we haven’t seen anything like this in the market,” Jayaram said, “so in the future, we’re hoping to get a patent for it.”
The iPod-charging exercise bike, which was developed by senior mechanical engineers Shobit Tandon, Abe Alexander, Cason Male, and Madhu Bhagavatula, is another example of technological innovation. The design involves attaching a generator to the wheel of an exercise bike which then charges the battery of an iPod. The project won the award for best overall design at the mechanical engineering showcase in the fall semester.
Several student organizations were also represented during the showcase. The Robotics Club’s “Robot Colony Project” aims to replace one large, expensive robot, which can accomplish only one task at a time, with many smaller, cheaper robots. The robots use infrared range finders to avoid collision with walls and other robots. With the help of the range finders and encoders, the club, currently funded by a Small Undergraduate Research Grant (SURG), is trying to develop cooperative mapping behavior to enable the robot to determine its position and environment. The robot will then be able to send the information back to a central server that can then use the data to create a map of the environment. Christopher Mar, a junior majoring in electrical and computer engineering, explained, “We’re programming each robot with a very simple behavior —to avoid walls and other robots—but when you throw them all together, hopefully something bigger arises.” The Robotics Club won the “People’s Choice Award” at the showcase.
Fringe Buggy, Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Racing, and Kiltie Kar were three other student organizations that participated in the showcase. 
These three clubs all focus on creating dynamic projects that are entered into annual racing competitions. Each group has performed exceptionally well in each of its respective competitions. 
Fringe has won the annual buggy design competition for the past 10 years, while Kiltie Kar placed second at last year’s national American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) chemical car competition. SAE Racing, which attends one annual competition in Detroit, placed 53rd last year in the overall competition out of 110 competitors, and also placed 23rd out  of 110 in the endurance race.
TechBridgeWorld, a Carnegie Mellon program that seeks to improve literacy among visually-impaired youth, presented the “Braille Writing Tutor” during the showcase. The Braille Tutor uses a digital stylus that interfaces to a computer, PDA, or SimPuter interface. This allows the utilization of text-to-speech software that can provide immediate feedback to the students to help them correct their mistakes while they are learning. After perfecting the use of the digital stylus, the students can then move on to learning how to use the slate and stylus. The system has been tested in India and Tanzania, and will soon be tested in China and the United States. The Braille Tutor won the “Impact Award” at the showcase.
The Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) presented its project “Get In Line,” which aims to create interactive experiences for people waiting in lines. Last year, the group created an interactive game for people waiting in line for the annual “Building Virtual Worlds” show. Andrew Federspiel, a master’s student at the ETC, said, “We had maybe 200 people waiting in line playing this game. It’s scalable, so it doesn’t matter how many people join in to play.” 
The game involves players identifying themselves as either left-brained or right-brained, and then, based on this identification, they can compete in games with other players standing in line. The group, which consists of about nine members, is planning to spin the project off as their own company.

Autism is generally the term used for a mental affliction resulting in social impairment and repetitive behavior. However, many forms of autism exist, one of which is the Rain Man syndrome.
Those with the Rain Man syndrome are extremely skilled at a particular task, such as memorizing words, being able to predict days of the week like a calendar, doing mental calculations or even painting. However, there is a catch — along with prodigious skill of some sort, there is a certain mental disability or autism.
Named after the famous movie, Rain Man, this syndrome is more commonly known as savant syndrome. A common misconception is that autism and savant syndrome are always linked — this is not true. Kim Peek, the character on whom Raymond Babbitt, the autistic character in Rain Man, is based, is not actually autistic, although he has developmental disabilities.
Savant syndrome is characterized by an enormous memory and prodigious ability in a specific area of study. According to the Wisconsin Medical Society, savants have “astonishing islands of ability, brilliance, or talent that stand in stark, markedly incongruous contrast to overall limitations.” 
The cause for these skills can be genetic, but can also result from injury before, during, or after birth, up through adulthood. The Society estimates that savant syndrome affects approximately 10 percent of autistic individuals. Savants may be able to memorize great amounts of trivia, numbers, facts, or obscure information. In addition, these individuals can show immense interest in random mundane sounds or objects. Savants with skills in certain areas, such as music or mathematics, are extraordinarily gifted in these areas. Some can play entire pieces on the piano after hearing them only once. An article on telegraph.co.uk introduces Daniel Tammet, a noted savant with the ability to describe the processes in his mind, who is able to memorize numbers quickly, perform complex mathematics, and learn a language in a week. Another story, reported in ABC News, is about Stephen Wiltshire, an artist. Wiltshire drew the entirety of central London, Rome, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, among other cities, after one helicopter trip around them. Interestingly enough, it is noted that savant skills are seemingly limited to five areas — music, art, mathematical calculations, calendar calculations, and spatial skill. The history of savant syndrome appears as early as 1751, in a German psychology publication titled Gnothi Sauton.
The first documented case was a mathematical prodigy named Jedediah Buxton, who was able to perform calculations in his head with remarkable speed. In the years that followed, more cases were documented of individuals who had incredible mathematical ability, but lacked comprehension of the world around them. 
An article on the website of the Wisconsin Medical Society states that in 1887, Dr. J. Langdon Down, after whom Down syndrome is named, recorded 10 different cases of savants who had different abilities, and named them “idiot savants” not as an insult, but because their IQs were recorded below 25, and idiot was the medically accepted term.
While still much of a mystery, savant syndrome is being researched more and more to be better understood. 
Experiments done involving electrical brain stimulation have shown that much of the brain’s memory remains unused. Hence, many researchers believe that every person’s mind has the ability of a savant. There have been documented cases of elderly individuals who, after progressive brain dementia, developed savant abilities.

A year ago, archaeologists made the claim that Stonehenge in England was a part of an ancient religious complex where the remains of cremations were buried. The story, reported in ABC News, goes on to say that the main evidence for this theory came from the discovery of cremated remains of nearly 240 people, which were buried there over the course of 500 years. This astonishing discovery would not have been possible had it not been for a technique that allowed the researchers to correctly calculate the age of the remains. 
The technique of radiocarbon dating has contributed immensely to science by figuring out the ages of a variety of specimens ranging from Stone Age men trapped in glaciers to the Dead Sea Scrolls.
The technique of radiocarbon dating was developed by Willard Libby in the 1940s. According to an article in the British newspaper The Times, the technique proved to be such a powerful tool for scientists that Libby received a Nobel Prize for his work in 1960. 
Libby’s groundbreaking technique stemmed from the simple discovery that plants absorb a radioisotope of carbon, carbon-14, into their tissues. Carbon-14 is a radioisotope of normal carbon, carbon-12. Both carbon-14 and carbon-12 have six protons, but while carbon-12 has six neutrons, carbon-14 has eight neutrons. 
This difference allows carbon-14 to be radioactive while carbon-12 is non-radioactive.
Carbon-14 is present in small quantities in the atmosphere and is constantly being produced by a reaction involving cosmic rays and nitrogen atoms. When cosmic rays enter the earth’s atmosphere, they collide with atoms in the upper layers of the atmosphere; this collision can lead to the production of energized neutrons. 
These energized neutrons then collide with nitrogen atoms, which make up the major portion of air. Nitrogen nuclei, which have seven protons and seven neutrons, lose a proton due to the bombardment with a neutron and get converted into carbon-14 nuclei. 
Carbon-14 atoms then react with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide containing the carbon-14 isotope. This carbon dioxide (14CO2) is then taken up by plants and enters the life cycle of living organisms. 
Carbon-14, being radioactive, emits a beta particle, which is essentially an electron, and gets converted to nitrogen-14. 
Thus, there is a constant cycle going on in living organisms: They take up the 14CO2 into their bodies, and the carbon-14 in their bodies decays to nitrogen. Because of this continuous cycle of taking up 14CO2 and then with  the decaying of carbon-14, the proportion of carbon-14 in the bodies of all living organisms remains the same. 
In living organisms, the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 is approximately 1.3×10-12 to one. However, once the organism dies, it can no longer incorporate new 14CO2 into its body, and the amount of carbon-14 inside the organism gradually goes on decreasing.
Thus, when archaeologists encounter the remains of a plant or animal, they can measure the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in the organism and compare it to the ratio present in living organisms. By knowing this ratio and the half-life of carbon-14, which is around 5700 years, it is possible to calculate how much time has passed since the organism died. 
Ever since it was developed, this technique has been used in a broad range of fields. 
The Times article relates the discovery of a frozen Stone Age man found in the Alpine glaciers in 1991. 
Carbon dating was used to estimate the ice man’s age to be around 5300 years old. This discovery caused a great stir in the scientific community, as the man’s corpse was the oldest ever to be found. 
Radiocarbon dating has also been useful in figuring out the ages of Egyptian mummies, and even the different layers of the Grand Canyon.
Although the technique has proven to be quite helpful, its main drawback is that it assumes that the proportion of carbon-14 in the atmosphere remains constant over time. This proportion actually goes on changing and scientists have been trying to refine the technique’s accuracy by taking into account the changing proportion of carbon-14. 
The principle of carbon dating can be used even with different elements. Potassium-40 is a radioactive isotope which is naturally found in the body. Potassium-40, thus, can also be used to determine the age of an organism. 
However, carbon dating is still the most popular method of determining the age of fossils and other organic material. 
According to an article in Wired, because of an increased level of nuclear activity, the proportion of radioactive isotopes changed drastically in the 1950s and 1960s. Scientists hence need to recalibrate the proportions of carbon-14 for all specimens to be dated after this time.

Laser therapy treats stroke
A recent study conducted by researchers in California has shown that sending laser beams into the brain could help patients with mild strokes. The study, published in the journal Stroke, was conducted on 660 stroke patients. Fifty-two percent of the patients who had mild strokes and were given the laser treatment had less severe disabilities due to strokes, as compared to 42 percent who were not given the laser treatment.
The treatment consists of low-energy infrared radiation sent into the brains of patients. The researchers are still uncertain why laser therapy benefits stroke patients, but they believe that it may reduce cell death, induce new cell growth in the brain, or increase the metabolism of cells in the brain.

Vaccine helps lung cancer patients
Scientists in Cuba have developed a vaccine called CimaVax EGF that has been successful in increasing the life of terminal lung cancer patients. Trials conducted in over 700 patients have shown that the vaccine is capable of increasing the life of such patients on average by four months, and in some cases, by several years.
Although the vaccine does not completely cure cancer or prevent it, it causes the patient’s body to produce antibodies against the epidermal growth factor (EGF), which causes lung cancer cells to grow.

Theory  explains Alzheimer’s disease
Scientists from the Buck Institute in California and the Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique in France have discovered that Alzheimer’s disease may be the result of a disruption in neuronal signaling in the brain. Until now, the accepted cause for Alzheimer’s disease was the formation of plaques — called amyloid plaques — in the brain, which cause cell death.
The recent study showed that the amyloid precursor protein (APP), previously linked to the formation of the plaques, could bind to another protein called netrin-1. Netrin-1 helps guide neurons to make connections in the brain and helps them survive. When netrin-1 was given to mice that had the gene causing Alzheimer’s disease, their symptoms were reduced.

Pill helps reduce bad memories
Researchers at the University of Amsterdam have discovered that the drug propranolol helps people forget bad memories. In the study, 60 volunteers were shown a picture and given a mild electric shock as they viewed the picture. Half of the patients were given propranolol while the other half were given a placebo pill. On the third day, the patients were shown the pictures again and those who had taken proranolol showed a lower emotional response than those who had not taken the drug.
Researchers believe that this treatment could help patients with post-traumatic stress disorder and other emotional disorders.

LG to use Windows in smartphones
Microsoft signed a deal with LG Electronics that states that LG will use Microsoft OS in most of its smartphones. Microsoft also renamed its wireless service from Windows Mobile to Windows. 
The new Windows operating system will feature a powerful mobile Internet Explorer web browser. It also includes a wireless backup system for contacts and pictures.
Currently, HTC is the largest phone manufacturer that uses Microsoft OS. Samsung Electronics, Motorola, and Sony Ericsson do not have many phones with Windows OS on the market.

Scientists develop nano electronics
Two American teams have synthesized new materials to make smaller and more powerful electronics. A team from the University of Pittsburgh has made smaller transistors that can be used to make smaller computer processors. 
The size of the new computer processor would be a fraction of current silicon-based processors. 
The other team, from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the University of California, Berkeley, has made a film material that boosts memory capacity. 
The new film material can hold the equivalent of 250 DVDs on the surface of a coin. Both new inventions were published in the journal Science.

MIT creates green washing machine
A team of students has used recycled materials to create a pedal-powered washing machine called “Bicilavadora.” The washing machine is designed for developing parts of the world where there is no access to electricity.  
The recycled machine is made out of a standard oil drum and welded with a short barrel. The system is connected to an old bicycle without wheels and the chain is connected to a gear mechanism. The high gear can be used for spin cycle while the low gear can be used for the wash cycle. 
Although the design is still not complete and some water seeped out during the initial tests of the device, it still shows great promise and small modifications in the design could allow it to handle large loads.

Mummy seen using a CT scanner
A team at the University of Chicago Medical Center has used a Computed Tomography (CT) scanner to determine the facial features of a 3000-year-old mummy. 
The image obtained is very lifelike and the researchers could see small details of the face even without opening the Egyptian casket. The high-tech scanner was a preferred method, since opening up the coffin could destroy the mummy. CT scans had previously been used to view pictures of mummies, but the quality was not as good as that achieved with the new CT scans. 
Also, previously the caskets had to be opened to run the scan, and this led to a loss of valuable evidence.

In old England, if a wife were ever unfaithful and this became public knowledge, her husband was called a “cuckold.”
According to Rose Sengenberger, a senior dramaturgy major and the dramaturg (the person who researches the history and period of the play) for this production, most of the marriages in London during this time were between old, stodgy men and young, lively ladies, utterly mismatched and hence hopelessly dull. The majority of the wives were thus completely dissatisfied with their marriages and wanted more than just to perform their two fundamental duties: being a status symbol for their husbands and producing their heirs. In such a situation, more than a few took on young lovers to satisfy their needs. The lovers were more than obliging, as by consorting with married women, there was little chance of their contracting diseases like syphilis or having to worry about the woman getting pregnant; she could pass off the child as her husband’s, and of course, since she was already married, she would never chase after her lover to marry her!
The London Cuckolds, a comedic play directed by voice and speech professor Don Wadsworth and performed by the School of Drama, describes this issue of marriage in England. It exposes the desire of the wife to seek satisfaction outside her marriage and displays the fear of becoming a cuckold that the husband harbors.
“I was teaching in London in 1998 when the play came out, so I went to see it at the Royal National Theater and immediately, completely fell in love with it,” Wadsworth commented. “And while I was watching it with my jaw on the floor ... I said to myself, ‘This play belongs in a university setting.’” Wadsworth believed that the play was meant for collegiate theater, as all its characters were in their 20s, a perfect age for college students to portray. The only older characters in the play were the three husbands, who were supposed to be in their 50s. Wadsworth, to keep the actors’ ages consistent with their characters, asked three faculty members to take on their roles: Matthew Gray, an assistant professor of acting, plays Doodle; Michael Chemers, an assistant professor of dramatic literature, plays Wiseacres; and Tony McKay, an associate professor of acting, plays Dashwell.
The play was written in 1681, during the Restoration period in England, a time when, after experimenting with being ruled by Parliament under Oliver Cromwell, England wished to restore its monarchy and requested Charles II to return from France to ascend the throne. With Charles II’s restoration, life in England became much less oppressed and the king’s tastes, like his love for expensive fashion and his need for having more than 15 mistresses who fathered him 14 illegitimate children, were transferred to the people.
In a time like this, the play follows the story of three aldermen, Doodle, Dashwell, and Wiseacres, who struggle to keep a tight rein on their straying wives. Each has a different kind of wife and a different approach to dealing with her. Doodle’s wife, Arabella, played by senior drama major Ryah Nixon, is “the witty wife,” whose smarts, Doodle declares, are an asset, as she isn’t easily tricked by clever suitors. But of course, this means that Arabella is easily able to trick Doodle with her wit, too. Dashwell’s wife, Eugenia, played by senior drama major Steffi Garrard, is “the zealous wife” who hides her discontent with pious behavior. Wiseacres, believing that the only way he can save himself from becoming a cuckold is by marrying “the foolish wife,” plans ahead and has his new bride, Peggy, played by senior drama major Laura Mixon, raised in the country away from the contact of men. Added to the mix are the three lovers, Ned Ramble, Frank Towney, and Valentine Loveday, played by senior drama majors Ian Harding, Adam Barrie, and Peter Albrink, respectively.
The play is a raunchy comedy, spiced with much sexual innuendo and a couple of heated bedroom scenes. It succeeds in making the audience laugh out loud with its hilarious plot and dialogue, as the audience watches the close encounters between the lovers and the husbands play out. “It actually feels like a modern play. It happens to be in 1680, but it doesn’t sound antique at all. [The play is] very, very packed and very sexy, very funny ... and when people come to see it, they’ll be amazed at how modern it is,” Wadsworth said.
The characters are all very distinct, and the actors all gave stellar performances. The pair of young suitors, Ramble and Towney, were especially hilarious to watch, and have a Pirates of the Caribbean-esque air about them, as they possess Orlando Bloom’s and Johnny Depp’s character traits. Peggy was also a very big hit with the audience, as with her country bumpkin routine she was able to put on a great comedic performance. Other actors who deserve mention are the maids of Arabella and Eugenia: Engine and Jane. Played by senior drama majors Sonja Field and Shelby Lewis, the maids are the confidants of their mistresses, carrying their messages to their suitors and warning them upon the arrival of their husbands.
With a hilarious plot, brilliant acting, and beautiful costumes and set design, The London Cuckolds provided a terrific glimpse into a slice of English history. Its period setting made the play enjoyable to watch, and it is surprising that so much of the play still seems relevant to this day.
The London Cuckolds is playing at the Philip Chosky Theater through Saturday, Feb. 28.

On Feb. 13 and 14, Scotch’n’Soda put on three performances of A Few Good Men, Aaron Sorkin’s play that was first produced on Broadway in 1989 and later adapted into a screenplay for the 1992 film. The play follows a trio of trial lawyers who uncover a high-level military cover-up after the death of a marine, William Santiago, while he is being given a “Code Red” — a “training” by his comrades given when a soldier is judged not to be fit — by fellow marines Harold Dawson and Louden Downey.
The Scotch’n’Soda actors did a spectacular job in matching their own abilities to the roles they had to play. Perhaps the most deserving of special mention is Tom Pike, a junior psychology and English major who played Lt. Jonathan Kendrick. Pike used a southern accent for his portrayal of Kendrick, a hard-nosed Marine who only believed in two things: God and the Corps. He also led the scene in the play in which the four leaders of Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta corps stand at attention and shout the Marine Code — “Unit, Corps, God, Country” — at the top of their lungs. This was a very important scene as it showcased the strict code of honor and loyalty that all Marines — Dawson and Downey included — lived by, and the entire scene ran without a hitch.
In addition, leading men Josh Jelin (Daniel Kaffee), a senior mathematical sciences and business administration major, and Alex DiClaudio (Nathan Jessup), a senior economics major, along with Shannon Deep (Lt. Cmdr. Joanne Galloway), a junior humanities and arts major, nailed their characters’ personalities. As the brutal but well-intentioned Galloway, Deep took her performance to a new level, showing off her acting depth by showcasing her character’s steadfast resolve, yet obvious inexperience extremely well.
Sorkin adapted the stage version of the show for film three years after its debut. The film, which was nominated for five Academy Awards, showcased an all-star cast featuring Jack Nicholson, Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Kiefer Sutherland, and Kevin Bacon, among others. Nicholson’s memorable line, “You can’t handle the truth!” was voted as the 29th greatest movie quote of all time by the American Film Institute.
Jelin, a long time member of Scotch’n’Soda, spoke about his role and Wheelahan’s vision for the play. “It wasn’t Tom Cruise that drew me to the role, that’s for sure. I was really excited when I heard we were doing A Few Good Men, and this was a role I thought I could perform well in, so I auditioned and ran with it,” Jelin said, and indeed, Jelin did a great job demonstrating Kaffee’s eventual understanding of the large stage he was meant to perform on. He transformed his character from an immature jock who cares more about softball than about his clients to a successful trial lawyer.
Such a well-known and well-respected film obviously brings challenges to those who attempt to replicate it. Director Chris Wheelahan, a sophomore information systems major, was aware of the impact such a high profile film could have on his actors and prepared for it.
“I told them at the first rehearsal that they were banned from watching the movie until we were done. In theater, it’s a big thing that you don’t want to imitate what others have done, and I wanted them to develop their own characters. I think they did a really good job,” Wheelahan said.
Scotch’n’Soda’s next show will be its annual Carnival show, with Shannon Deep and Alex DiClaudio co-directing Me and My Girl, a musical comedy.

The SPIRIT fashion show, “Glamour Aftermath,” took place in Wiegand Gymnasium on Friday, Feb. 13. The show opened with an elderly woman reciting a story of creation behind a group of models, the girls in nude and black bandeau tops and skimpy boy shorts, and the boys in similar bottoms, were heaped on top of one another on stage. After the piece was over, the models awoke disoriented and confused, portraying the birth of mankind. Each model walked onto the stage wrapped in a boa with a stick, complete with tribal makeup, and all of them joined in a semblance of an African family at the end of the runway.
After this opening was the first scene, titled “Pink Lady.” The song playing in the background was “You Are My African Queen.” Traditional garb, both men’s and women’s wear, with colorful fabric and ornate headpieces were modeled. The next scene was entitled “Fig Leaf,” where the models walked out in pairs wearing modern, flirty dresses. The color scheme was black and pink with ultra feminine silhouettes, shiny fabrics, and stilettos.
The next scene, “Dee Hall,” was comprised of all female models dressed in black with accompanying bold accessories: hats in bright colors and vibrant chunky jewelry. Jonelle Saunders, a sophomore science and humanities scholar, and Princess Parker-Smith, a sophomore biomedical and material sciences engineering major, designed a line that was an alluring display of lirty bright clothing in stunning silhouettes. 
The concept behind their line revolved around the recent Kanye West song “Heartless” from his 2008 album, 808s and Heartbreak, which played in the background during their scene. A model, Ian Coleman, a first-year in H&SS, stood in the center of the runway in black pants and shirt with gold and silver streamers attached to his torso. As each of the female models entered the runway, they ripped these strips off his shirt and flung them aside, leaving him stripped of the streamers at the end of the scene. 
The next scenes that followed were full of high-energy songs, which seemed to dictate the mood of the models, who were projecting a fierce intensity and confidence that couldn’t have come from anywhere but the clothes. Common’s new single, “Universal Mind Control,” played during “412,” where bright colors were featured on male and female models in urban apparel and street wear. Similar outfits were sported during the “Decades” scene, where models showed off clothes from the local vintage shop that bears the same name. 
The last scene before the intermission was especially enjoyable, featuring designs by “Ms. Dig,” (Allison Diggory) a University of Pittsburgh student who first debuted her line of hand-painted garments last year. This year she expanded past just shirts, dresses, and hoodies by introducing leggings, jeans, and tunics. There were 21 pieces, each with a large graphic symbol or emblazoned with a message like “Don’t Sleep on Me,” “Smooth Operator,” or “Maneater.” Her scene featured a live rap performance by Nick Pratt, a popular local artist and University of Pittsburgh student.
The entertainment factor went sky high after the first act ended. During the intermission, there was a competitive audience walk-off, and multiple dance breaks opened the second act. There was also a performance of a poem that began and ended with the lines, “I hate suga babies/May my flavor forever be sweet,” by one of the chairs of the show, Carnegie Mellon alumnus Rigardo Rush. It addressed the controversial issue of homosexuality in contemporary society. 
For the lingerie scene, black lights illuminated the stage while male models in boxer briefs lined the perimeter of the runway, and Rush came out in similar fashion and poured paint on each of the models. The black light made this paint fluoresce a neon yellow, giving an eerie ambience to the whole scene. The houselights flooded the stage as the female models walked out in their lingerie: bustiers and negligees, babydolls and garter belts, silk and lace. 
The house music during this scene was a song by Kat DeLuna, where in the lyrics she poses the question: “Are you wild and dirty like an animal? Can you growl and scream like an animal?” There were murmurs among the crowd that this show had become a little too risqué for their liking. 
After the lingerie scene, there was one more dance break and then the final two scenes. “Charles Spiegel for Men” featured an all-male cast in full three- and two-pieced, double- and single-breasted suits with matching ties. The men looked debonair in their pinstripes and button up shirts. 
Before the models strutted their stuff, a clip of Martin Luther King Jr.’s infamous “I have a dream” speech played mixed in with a clip of Barack Obama announcing his presidency. Some pretty patterned dresses that would be great for a date showed up in the final scene, and even some furs were spotted on some of the models, a surprising but refreshing feature.
On the whole, despite some technical hitches and wardrobe malfunctions, the show was exciting and colorful.

I subscribe to the thinking that, organically, all humans are fundamentally the same. We all need or desire the same things; we just go about getting them differently. But this happy little ideology of mine was heavily challenged this past summer. I hadn’t seen the impact of my summer abroad in Pakistan until I was in the U.S., two weeks after I had returned from Karachi. I was with friends in D.C., sandwiched in the languorous summer, to feel at ease and be young and act free. We went out at night where all the young and salacious go, but amid all of this, something didn’t feel quite right. My friend said I had been acting differently since I came back from Pakistan, because I was quieter and more serious. I guess I was overwhelmed by this nightlife I was encountering with them — so fundamentally different from the sable Karachi sky.
In Karachi, late at night — even on weekdays — families were out, being busy. Draped in luxurious fabric, the women of these families were guarded by crowds of male relatives and children. I’d admire the women’s long, dark hair and beautiful, delicate wrists. Sometimes I’d catch a clavicle and think, “Oh! How pretty!”
Most of these extended families were out so late in the lively streets to share conversations over a dinner that usually lasted two to three hours. One night, my aunts and uncles took me to a nihari shop, which serves a dish of thick gravy and tender meat, after the eight o’clock prayer. We sopped up the gingery stew with warm rounds of naan, a soft, white bread, as it was spun out of the clay kiln in which it was baked. It was hot, and we were in the “family” section of the restaurant, where the only things that were keeping us cool were the fans that were whirring rapidly. But they still weren’t enough to keep my back from growing moist with sweat, which dampened the print of my salwar kameez, a traditional dress worn by women in Pakistan that I happily sported. We ate with our hands, while I peered at the families, trying to decode their brown, sun-dried faces and deep, expressive eyes. Modest and loyal, the mothers sat proudly, while their children sat on their laps like baby birds, anticipating a hand of food in between the rushed conversation and the cramped tables.
Food became very important to me in Pakistan. It was through such pleasurable social experience that I was able to talk and listen to people whom I was unable to approach. At Aga Khan University (AKU), where I completed a neurology internship, I would enter the cafeteria, shy and alone, and sooner or later, a lonely girl would join me in my corner and I’d make a friend. These girls, once I got to know them, were all so impressive, so aggressive, and so independent. Some would just be finishing medical school at age 24, some were recently engaged to be married, while others were traveling to the U.S. to conduct research in collaboration with Pakistani universities.
In the women’s hostel at AKU, where I lived, all my friends were in their late 20s or early 30s but looked more youthful than I (some women even asked me how many children I had!). We spent most of our time talking and laughing in the air-conditioned common room. The heat was too unbearable everywhere else. They cooked for me and took care of me, and I reveled in their attention and nourishment. We gathered in the common room every evening after prayer and ate bhindi (okra) accompanied with warm bread and freshly prepared dahi (yogurt), both purchased from a man with a cart on the way to the mosque. The man had a crooked eye and tried to get me to pay more than was necessary, which I sometimes did. Occasionally, my friends Rehana and Ambreen would take me to the canteen, which sold crunchy delectable samosas, fried triangular snacks filled with potatoes and spices, and shammi kebabs, skewered mince meat with ground chickpeas, that were securely tucked into ghee-covered parathas, buttered flat bread. After that, we’d walk back with “choco-explosion” ice cream bars from the drugstore on the street corner. The owner of the store had been killed in a robbery and his brother had taken the business over. He had a sad smile and encouraged me to converse in Urdu with his children, who climbed up the shelves like monkeys to get products for customers.
With all that eating, you’d think the women would be “pleasantly plump.” But, in fact, almost all the women I saw were skinny and petite. Only Uranous, a beautiful Afghani student who was named after the planet Uranus, was “healthy,” as Pakistani women termed being chubby, like me. Uranous and I would go speed walking in fast circles below the turbid sky and sticky night, wearing our salwar kameezes, which I disliked having to wear for exercise. We’d talk about the man in her life and she’d teach me Urdu. Sweaty and tired, we’d come back to sit in the common room and watch Indian television shows at 10 p.m. over shared slices of cold mango and leftover kheer, cardamom-spiced rice pudding, from the cafeteria.
My parents were terrified of sending me to what Newsweek deemed “the most dangerous place on Earth,” but I’m grateful they finally let me visit Pakistan. It’s important to test yourself, because being so wrapped up in an unfamiliar country with your own sublime loneliness, you grow and employ facets of yourself that you never knew existed.
When I came back to the U.S., it wasn’t just the country that I was afraid of; it was all the attachments to my identity that I wanted to avoid. My alienation arose out of that night in D.C. My friends and I ended up spending it in an ice cream parlor. I was trying not to be negative, but the raspberry ripple I was eating was flat and gooey. I felt a lump in my throat. We didn’t even know what to say to each other. I had become so used to the Pakistani notion of mealtime — an intoxicating exchange of loud talking and bold flavor –– that this evening was just ending up as a big fat disappointment.

The Feb. 14–15 weekend was a fashion-filled one as it witnessed both the SPIRIT “Glamour Aftermath” and Lunar Gala Evolve fashion shows. On Saturday night, students crammed into the Wiegand Gymnasium to witness the annual Lunar Gala show.
The show was originally inspired as a celebration of the Chinese New Year. The beginning of the show featured a live lion dance performance, a traditional form of Chinese dance that involves people imitating a lion’s movements from underneath an elaborate costume. 
Next, models began to work the runway, dressed in clothing designed by students or showcasing the styles of local vendors. Lunar Gala gives student designers a chance to express their own creativity through fashion, with the models being their canvas. Some scenes in the show were designed by students but featured clothes from a retail store, such as 412 or Decades.
“We had designers pinning outfits on us [models] and custom fitting the clothing to our bodies. What really struck me was that we are wearing clothes that students designed, so I was representing the vision of someone right in front of me,” said Brieanna Nesbit, a first-year business major who walked as a model for the show.
The overall theme of the show, Evolve, was featured throughout every scene of the night. Some scenes in the Lunar Gala show were very abstract and conceptual, such as one scene following the evolution of flour. 
“I really liked the focus on the clothes and design [in the Lunar Gala show],” said Nesbit. “The ‘Flour’ scene was really cute! I liked how each model came out and showed the transition from flour to baking and one girl looked like a cupcake,” said Nesbit.
Sara Berhie, a sophomore economics major, really enjoyed designing her line, “Pretend,” for the fashion show with Julian Imbrescia, a sophomore drama and self-defined H&SS major. “Julian already had experience in making clothes, so we thought it would be fun to design a line for Lunar Gala,” said Berhie. 
The designers of “Pretend” were inspired by fairy tales and “the childhood stories we all hear. We wanted to show the evolution of this abstract idea of a fairy,” said Berhie. 
The show had similar themes to the SPIRIT fashion show the night before, but “the vibe is completely different,” said Nesbit. “SPIRIT is about being a fashion event, whereas Lunar Gala originated as a celebration of the New Year, and is a celebration of students’ creativity,” said Ian Coleman, a first-year global politics major.
The process of running the show was very stressful. Backstage, models and clothes filled the Connan Room as people ran back and forth from the dressing room to the stage. Coleman worked as a behind-the-scenes model coordinator for the show. “It was very hectic backstage, but we managed to pull off a great show,” said Coleman.
Yet, some people felt that this year’s show wasn’t as good as the year before. Samson Debela, a junior civil engineering major, commented that the show was missing “that ‘wow’ factor like last year when people were wearing metal clothes. I was excited to see the show and I thought it was pretty cool, but I wanted to be blown away.” Adrienne Wilson, a sophomore art major, felt differently. “The show was very extravagant as far as stretching the rules of fashion with the themes in each scene. I enjoyed it,” she said. The clothing ranged from casual outfits that people could actually wear on the street, such as simple pieces with an added flair of an oversized rose or feathers. Other pieces, such as a beaded top that looked like a necklace, may not be as appropriate for daily wear.
Many of the dresses featured in the show were thoughtfully detailed with special attention to fabric, color, and accessories, especially the “Feathers” scene. Beautiful ostrich feathers were used to adorn the belts, skirts, and backs of the models’ clothing.
Editor’s Note: Sara Berhie is a member of Tartan Business Staff.

Imagine a world without words, a world where people communicate only through dance, where the elegant movements of the body alone express the overpowering love between two people and their wish to die together rather than live apart. This was the world created by the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre in its Feb. 13 performance of Romeo et Juliette, a perfect fusion of elegant ballet and the epochal Shakespearean drama, Romeo and Juliet.
The show was performed at the Benedum Center in downtown Pittsburgh by performers who danced with great poise and confidence. The biggest pillar of the performance was the orchestra. The music matched the intensity of every scene — action scenes like when Tybalt (Alexandre Silva) and Mercutio (Daisuke Takeuchi) duel — were accompanied by loud, striking music, while the romantic scenes between Romeo (Christopher Rendall-Jackson) and Juliet (Erin Halloran) had slow, soothing music in the background. The music evoked empathy from the audience for each character, and it was an important and powerful element of the show.
The stage was set simply with white and black backgrounds. In most of the performance, the costumes were simple, too, causing the dancers’ movements and postures to stand out. A notable feature of the costumes was that they were color-coded. As the story’s premise focuses on the feud between two families, the Montagues and the Capulets were distinguished by the different shades they wore. The Capulets, except Juliet and her nurse (Ashley Wegmann), were dressed in shades of black, while the Montagues, wore light colors. 
For the majority of the performance, Romeo was wearing a white suit, depicting him as a true and honest hero. Juliet wore a golden dress during the love scenes, hinting toward the happy and blissful state of her mind, and a gray dress during the scene of her death, reflecting her sorrow and dismal fate.
The love scenes between Romeo and Juliet were heart-rending. The famous balcony scene started with Juliet fantasizing about Romeo. Then Romeo entered the scene and was left so love-struck by the sight of her that he dropped his coat. Their subsequent dance made their love even more evident because their dance steps were choreographed in such a manner that one’s dance would have been incomplete without the other. Another romantic scene between Romeo and Juliet was when they spent time with each other one night. The scene portrayed a sequence that could be the experience of any couple, in which Romeo wants to kiss Juliet and she doesn’t allow it at first, and then, when Romeo is upset, Juliet comes and kisses him. Also, the way Romeo watches Juliet dance for a long period of time shows how much he is enraptured by her.
Another extraordinary scene in the performance was when two of the major characters of the play were killed. One was Mercutio, who was killed by Tybalt, Juliet’s cousin, and the other was Tybalt himself. The beauty of this scene was that the two bodies were dragged across the stage in white drapes with their supporters walking along with the bodies. Another remarkable performance in this scene was the dance performed by Lady Capulet (Elysa Hotchkiss). She seemed to be totally tormented by seeing the death of her son, Tybalt, and her dance expresses her heartbroken state. First, she danced vigorously with rage, and gradually, it changed to a slower dance to mark her sad state. By the end of the scene, she seemed to be shattered and was dragged off the stage by a member of her family.
Comic relief was presented in two scenes. In one, Juliet’s nurse hilariously describes one of Juliet’s childhood stories by jumping and wailing like a baby, while in another Romeo’s friends mock Romeo in jest when they come to know that he has fallen in love. They make fun of Romeo by imitating him running to and fro to impress Juliet, proclaiming that he will be at Juliet’s beck and call from now on.
This is only the second dance troupe in the U.S. that has performed Romeo and Juliet in the form of a ballet, and they did a splendid job. From the nurse’s comedic act and the tragic deaths of the two young lovers to the powerful orchestral accompaniment and flawless dancing of the company, Romeo et Juliette proved that music and dance have the power to express more emotion than words ever can.
The next show by Pittsburgh Ballet Theater is American Rhythms, running from March 19-22 at the Byham Theater.

Magazines are all boasting “money-saving” bargains these days, but for many readers, especially those of us in college, fringed Phillip Lim skirts priced at $495 and Lanvin T-shirts at $478 are just not realistic options. Fashion-forward magazines like Harper’s Bazaar, Vogue, and W provide stunningly inspirational style ideas and covetable pieces, but they aren’t always the most economical venues from which to make purchases. 
So how can one manage to look good, especially in preparation for spring, without dropping thousands of dollars with each outfit? The answer is simple and clichéd, but it’s a mantra that works: invest in worthy pieces and cinch spending on everything else. What exactly defines a “worthy” investment piece? Many would argue it is one whose value appreciates with time, but unless it is a Hermès Birkin bag, whose starting price is at $10,000, or a $2500 Chanel 2.55 bag, it’s hard to equate any clothing piece to sturdy long-term stock. A more modern, refined way to define it is any pricier piece that will transcend seasons and styles.
An investment piece isn’t always the most expensive, however. For example, an inclusion of fine details like sharp structure on a dress (a la Balenciaga); the practicality of an item, such as in a classically supple black leather satchel; or the simplicity in a flawlessly designed silk blouse are all much more decisive factors. A perfectly soft and sheer T-shirt from T by Alexander Wang will run you around $80, but think of all the ways you can wear it: it pairs perfectly with simple jeans or shorts, drapes just right as an under-layer, and most importantly, the quality will not diminish with every wear and wash. Clearly, an investment is less about how much you pay for it and more about how much you get out of it.
As Fashion Week for fall 2009 is happening around the world, editors, bloggers, and critics seem to be blown away by the collective “constructivism” mindset that many designers have taken on. At BCBG Max Azria, models wore paneled dresses with just the right amount of slinkiness; the Proenza Schouler house has been receiving non-stop praise for its witty reconstruction and the textures the designers used for their collection.
Creativity and uniqueness shine on around designer tents everywhere, and the same technique should be used to spot splurge-worthy pieces. Jiwon Hur, a junior architecture major, wore a chic sweater with a one-of-a-kind pearl, jewel, and lace applique, which she paired with an oversized scarf. Hur put together a perfect outfit in shades of pastels, but remained modern with a versatile sweater. Lily Hwang, a sophomore architecture major, gleamed in her safari-inspired khaki coat, which gave a terrific infusion of color to her otherwise dark outfit. It put a utilitarian spin on her feminine look, one that was heavily applauded on spring runways.
Be it a sweater, a coat, or a T-shirt, the bottom line is that there are no guidelines to picking out the right wardrobe investment. Instead, look over your closet, and the next time you go shopping, don’t shy away or ignore any pieces — be imaginative with what you can put together, and don’t be afraid to spend a little more on a worthy piece every now and then. The art of great style is to know how to put pieces together and how to pair high- and low-end items. What you deem worthy is up to you, and that’s the best part.

Madea Goes to Jail, written and directed by Tyler Perry, is a film that tells the story of Mable “Madea” Simmons, a well-known character created and played by Perry, who is finally punished for her numerous crimes. This doesn’t happen, though, until about halfway through the film. Like many of Perry’s other films, this one originated as a play and it highlights moments where Madea tries to “get before she gets got,” as she would say.
Madea Goes to Jail certainly has a talented cast, but that does little to hide the fact that it is an overly dramatic comedy that forgets to be funny. In fact, this film verifies that the ongoing story of Madea has turned into a soap opera that Perry has unconvincingly repackaged as a film.
Madea is a brassy and sassy, quick-tongued senior citizen, and Perry has done an outstanding job of making her a household name, but there is only so much her character can go through when she repeatedly appears in his films. Over time, she has become too familiar. In this latest installment, Madea is once again in court after being arrested in a car chase from the last Perry film. Of course, she gets off with only a suspended license and anger management classes; the arresting officers did not read her the Miranda rights because she was beating them up.
While Madea continues to cause trouble, the audience is introduced to Josh Hardaway (Derek Luke), an assistant district attorney prosecuting a prostitute, Candace Washington (Keshia Knight Pulliam). Because Josh knows Candace, he hands the case over to his colleague and fiancée Linda (Ion Overman) to prevent the situation from becoming too personal. 
Yet, unable to walk away, Josh enlists the help of a minister, Ellen (Viola Davis). Pulliam plays her character satisfactorily — she can cry rather well — showing a respectable effort in one of the few roles she has had since portraying Rudy Huxtable in The Cosby Show. Luke’s and Davis’ performances, however, are outstanding, but their superb acting overshadows the surrounding action at some points in the film.
The transitions in this film are often awkward, as the audience must switch from a dramatic scene with these polished actors to a “humorous” scene with Madea fighting the police or arguing with Dr. Phil. It actually makes it seem as if there are two separate movies going on concurrently. This effect is only strengthened by the small amount of crossover between the two stories.
Problems like this bring up the question of why, after so many films and plays, Perry is not producing better quality works. Perhaps it is because he turns out film after film quickly, with three more expected this year. To his credit, Perry has quickly developed a filmmaking empire, complete with his own state-of-the-art-studio. 
That is why Madea Goes to Jail is a disappointment, delivering unpolished directing, recycled jokes, and a script with many holes in it. Of course, this film was not created to become an Oscar contender, but Perry should have set higher standards for his loyal following.

A restaurant with the name of MacDonald’s advertises as “the standard of excellence.” Offering “candies, ice cream soda, and fancy boxes,” MacDonald’s (not to be confused with the modern chain) guarantees a level of quality that today’s fast food patrons can only dream of. Really, when was the last time you had french fries served to you in a snuff box?

Delta Upsilon fraternity is reprimanded for making a general ruckus. Pledges of the fraternity set off fireworks, which disturbed their neighbors. The judge presiding over the case shows the fraternity no mercy, ordering a “disciplinary warning” and giving the fraternity an “academic warning.” Making the front page of The Tartan, the heinous acts of Delta Upsilon will be remembered forever in infamy.

Hunt Library closes off its meeting rooms due to the lack of manpower to take care of them. Often, rooms would be left filthy. Other times, students would study in these rooms till late, bringing up issues of safety. Thankfully, the problem was solved with the addition of the Tepper School of Business, where students can proudly use state-of-the-art meeting rooms and even get yelled at for putting their feet on top of tables.

Carnegie Mellon’s population enters a boom period. With a record number of applicants, the school considers allowing more students through its doors. Editors at The Tartan disagree. Citing examples of students’ being denied choices of classes and even majors, The Tartan suggests putting a cap on admissions. The largest piece of evidence for overcrowding is the suggestion of renaming the university “Pitt: Part II.”

Dear Joe,
I know that I go to a tough school, but I can’t take any more whining. I’m surrounded by complainers, and feel as if they’re always raining on my parade. Any ideas on how to change their attitudes, or make me more complaint resistant?
—Whiny in West Wing
Dear Whiny,
You would think that living in a wonderful city, receiving a great education, and having the world at your fingertips make you happy. Unfortunately, Whiny, for those who are always trying to take from the world, nothing is ever good enough. A week-long vacation to a community college in Bulgaria would teach them a lesson in being thankful. As much as we would like to change the wave of negativity that floats around campus, there’s not much we can do. Like sun radiation, or Ugg boots, some experiences simply have to be dealt with. The difference is the protective measures we take against them. Avoid unreasonably negative people. For instance, those who complain about cookies, funk music, and high fives are suspect for investigation.
You should probably note that all people can be whiny at some times. It’s a natural product of being overworked and eating at Skibo Coffeehouse. An important responsibility of friendship is helping friends feel better. When a friend is starting into the downward spiral of misery, try to lift him out before it’s too late. And contrary to popular belief, LEN’s law does not occur. No matter how helpful you are in spreading your optimism, no one will steal your sunshine.
Turn that frown upside down,
Joe
Dear Joe,
Don’t laugh at me, but I have a stamp collection. Even for being a Carnegie Mellon student, I get harassed every day for searching through catalogs and the Internet to find that perfect stamp. Why is everyone so hostile toward stamps?
—Posted in Porter
Dear Posted,

If you were five years old, I would say that everyone is just jealous of your totally awesome stamp collection. The fact of the matter is: stamp collecting is dorky, even at Carnegie Mellon. Your activity falls into the “classical nerd” category. These are tasks considered “cool” to nerds 40 years ago, but now have given way to blogging, Internet gaming, and hygiene. Examples of classical nerd activities include wearing suspenders, bug or stamp collecting, cartography, and pen pals. Unfortunately, these activities are feverishly fun, which means they’re hard to get rid of when you realize that Eisenhower’s not in power.
Does this mean that you should give up your passion? Absolutely not, Posted. Fight the good fight and defend your quirky and somewhat antiquated hobbies. It’s people like you who tell the world how everything is sorted or what kind of glue goes best with balsa wood for that perfect model plane. Maybe the newer nerds aren’t impressed with your toys, but so be it. At least collecting stamps doesn’t result in repetitive stress injury. 
Return to Sender,
Joe

One of the reasons I adore ambient music is that it can draw your attention to a whole medley of sounds whirring along in otherwise complacent spaces. To capitalize on this ability of ambient music to sensitize listeners to sounds they usually ignore, I’ve invented a game. It’s called “We peeled the wallpaper from Brian Eno’s skull and guess what we found? A crude pencil sketch of your brother performing a carnal act with the neighbor girl! On top of an oscillator!”

Increasingly, international students at Carnegie Mellon who are finishing degrees in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) are choosing to pursue career opportunities outside of the United States after graduation.
Of the students pursuing degrees in STEM, 49 percent come from outside the United States, while only 20 percent of the total students at Carnegie Mellon come from outside the country, according to statistics on the university website.
Some students feel that this trend of homeward migration is in part a consequence of the general economic recession in the United States. “The crisis on Wall Street is making it difficult for any college student in the U.S. to get internships or jobs,” commented first-year engineering major Karen Yu. “If they [international students] can find better opportunities in their home countries ... there is not much incentive to stay here.” The crisis has affected all potential employees looking for jobs, not just college students.
In addition, many multi-national companies and organizations, such as Microsoft and Samsung, are expanding overseas and creating career opportunities outside of the United States. Yu explained, “Globalization and technological advances are removing geographic barriers, so job-seekers in general are going to spread out.” First-year computer science major Anuraag Jain, who is from India, also added, “I would like to find something (an internship or job during the summer) in California, but ... I’ll probably be able to still work for Microsoft or Apple if I go back to India.”
However, regardless of current events or globalization in the United States, many international students are simply obliged to return to their home countries after graduation. “Our government has awarded many Singaporean students scholarships on certain conditions,” explained first-year computer science major Jun Jie Liang. “After I graduate from Carnegie Mellon, I need to spend several years working in Singapore before I can find a job in the U.S.” The economies in emerging nations like Singapore are increasingly in demand for engineers and information specialists to compete in a more technological global economy. To encourage their youth to pursue careers in these fields, the governments of these nations are awarding full scholarships that characteristically allow local students to pursue degrees in STEM fields at many top universities in the United States or Europe. “Most scholarships require a bond of four or more years of work after graduation,” explained first-year computer science major Joseph Lum. “Our government is making an investment in us to apply what we have learned to stimulate our country’s economy.”
At the same time, the United States is also falling behind in general STEM education. According to the American Society for Engineering Education, China will likely produce almost eight times the number of engineers than will graduate in the United States this year. Students in India are also studying science and engineering at an average rate of three times that of the students in the United States.
“In secondary school, several of the required courses were about computer and information technology studies,” confirmed Jain.
The American Society for Engineering Education did note, however, that these gaps are in part due to a deliberate shift of focus to “soft” areas and liberal arts among many colleges and universities in the United States.
Nevertheless, many experts interpret trends of homeward migration and inferior STEM education as signs of the United States’ decline as a global superpower. STEM graduates play an increasingly vital role in the emerging technological economy.

Afghanistan poses a much greater challenge to U.S. foreign policy than Iraq, said Abdulkader Sinno, assistant professor of political science and near Eastern studies at Indiana University, at a lecture at Carnegie Mellon co-sponsored by the Muslim Students Association (MSA), the Arab Students Organization (ASO), the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, Heinz College, and the International Development Group.
Sinno, an expert on Afghanistan and author of the book  Organizations at War in Afghanistan and Beyond, laid out strategies he believes that the Obama administration must adopt if it is to succeed in Afghanistan. He elaborated on what he saw as the failures of the Bush administration, and he evaluated the strategic options that currently remain for the U.S. in Afghanistan.
Last year, the MSA invited a distinguished Iraqi scholar to discuss in a similar manner how U.S. foreign policy could improve in Iraq.
“Sinno’s holistic view of the situation in Afghanistan really broadened my view of the conflict in that region,” said Ziad Al Bawab, a Ph.D. candidate in the electrical and computer engineering department and board member of the MSA.
Sinno mapped out the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan by presenting the historical circumstances that led to it, as well as the present political framework that serves to aggravate it. Besides Taliban rule, he identified ethnic strife, opium trade, and institutional corruption as some of the major difficulties Afghanistan must overcome to avoid becoming a failed state.
Currently, there are about 38,000 U.S. and 32,000 NATO troops in the region, as stated in a New York Times article. Since the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, there has been a colossal escalation in U.S. military spending on the war in Afghanistan. 
Last week, President Obama announced the allocation of 17,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan, bumping the total up by almost 40 percent.
“One is forced to wonder why a state so notorious for its resistance to foreign occupation, did not resist U.S. occupation at first,” said Sinno.
According to Sinno, Afghanistan’s lack of active resistance to U.S. occupation in 2001 appeared to the West as a sign of acceptance, when it was in fact the crushing of the warlords that brought Afghans a temporary sense of peace.
Sinno explained the difference between the Taliban fighters that emerged victorious out of the Soviet war in Afghanistan and the extremist Taliban faction of today, which dominates a large portion of the region and is known for its predatory behavior against civilians. The former were nationalistic freedom fighters who managed to reunify Afghanistan by protecting its people from the warlords. The latter, however, is a consequence of the U.S. invasion.
The Taliban’s initial agenda of strict law and order gained popularity among the Pashtuns, the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan, said Sinno, adding that this internal transition was behind the Afghans’ lack of resistance.
“The Taliban [responsible for] the violence in Afghanistan today is a re-emergence of the defeated warlords,” said Sinno.
The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan during the 1980s stripped the warlords of their power. In response, the Central Intelligence Agency equipped the Afghan warlords with millions of dollars worth of ammunition. Armed by the U.S. and supported economically and militarily by Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, the warlords not only defeated the Soviets but also consolidated power by preying on the local population and benefiting from opium trade in the region.
During the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the U.S. military patronized the once-defeated warlords who in turn patronized Afghan citizens, said Sinno.
“Bush’s ‘Afghan model’ of warfare was a disaster from a policy point of view,” said Sinno. The Afghan model of warfare refers to the use of indigenous allies to replace American ground troops by employing U.S. air power, special operations forces, and weapons. “It allowed the defeated warlords to re-establish themselves and regain influence, degenerating Afghanistan into chaos,” he explained. 
Further, there has been a dramatic increase in militant and insurgent groups other than the Taliban since the U.S. invasion.
“Warlords and local leaders are seeing where the wind will blow, so they can safely join the winning side. The day these insurgents join the Taliban, the U.S. will lose this war,” predicted Sinno.
Sinno also said that President Hamid Karzai’s government defeats the purpose of establishing a democratic state because it does not allow the creation of parties, centralizing all political power in the hands of Karzai.
In addition to Afghanistan’s corrupt government, the growing drug economy, and poor infrastructure, the instability in neighboring Pakistan deserves immediate U.S. attention, said Sinno.
Instead of further arming Afghan militias by forming the Afghan Public Protection Force, the U.S. must devise a Marshall Plan for Pakistan, said Sinno.
On the recent allocation of troops to Afghanistan by the Obama administration, Sinno said that the surge would only work if it were a part of a broader, more comprehensive strategy to stabilize Afghanistan.
Sinno brought the lecture to a close by proposing that President Karzai must allow the Taliban to run in democratic elections later this year.
“If they accept to run in elections, they will not get a lot of votes. And if they do get considerable votes, they will become a part of the state apparatus,” said Sinno.
President of the ASO and sophomore science and humanities scholar, Bassem Mikhael, said, “An excellent lecture. I was impressed by the conversational nature of the event. We really wanted to generate healthy discussion, and it did exactly that.”

Some Greek organizations are not living up to their founding ideals, while others may be surpassing them, according to a report released this week by the Division of Student Affairs. 
A half-dozen organizations logged an average of zero hours of community service per member, indicating the disproportionate number of hours performed by the rest: overall, Carnegie Mellon’s fraternities and sororities managed to contribute 5922 total hours of community service, as well as raise over $25,000 for local and national charities.
Alpha Kappa Delta Phi made the most significant commitment to volunteering, with 37 hours of community service per member last semester. 
The women more than doubled second-place finishers Kappa Alpha Theta and Kappa Delta Rho, who each logged approximately 15 hours of community service hours per member.
The zero hours that members of at least five organizations logged falls well below the campus average for Greek organizations in community service hours reported per member, according to the report.
“In addition to a general summary of any campus involvement, community service, and philanthropic activities, the chapters are asked to provide specific data regarding community service participation [number of hours and participating members for each activity being reported],” said Cathy O’Domes from the Student Life Office. 
“If the chapters choose not to provide this information or indicate that they did not perform any community service, then it is reported as zero,” she continued.
Monica Bebie, the report’s author from Student Life, was out of town for a conference last week and unavailable for comment, but offered to meet after The Tartan’s publishing deadline.
The report also detailed Greek community QPA statistics, percentage of members belonging to outside organizations, and percentage of members performing leadership roles on campus. 
Sigma Nu and Kappa Phi Lambda performed the worst in QPA among Greeks, while Kappa Alpha Theta barely beat out Delta Gamma and Alpha Epsilon Pi for earning the highest QPAs among Greek organizations. 
These three all beat the all-university average of 3.19. Delta Gamma and Kappa Alpha Theta, as two of the five Panhellenic sororities, beat the all-women’s average of 3.21. 
Twenty-four members of the Greek community received a 4.0 for the fall 2008 semester.
Overall, the five Panhellenic sororities achieved the highest QPA, beating the IFC fraternities, NPHC, and Asian-American chapters’ averages.
The organizations reporting zero hours of community service per member included Delta Delta Delta, Delta Tau Delta, Alpha Phi Alpha, Kappa Alpha Psi, and Lambda Phi Epsilon. 
The report did not include hours logged for philanthropic fundraising, but none of the aforementioned organizations responded to repeated e-mail requests for additional information as of press time. 
Nisha Phatak, a junior majoring in statistics and public relations representative for Kappa Kappa Gamma, which logged approximately one hour of community service per member for the fall 2008 semester, declined to comment. 
She based this position on her organization’s unorthodox policy of not allowing their public relations representative to comment in public forums like newspapers.
According to the report, as of last semester, Carnegie Mellon was home to 24 fraternities and sororities, including five Panhellenic sororities, 11 Interfraternity Council fraternities and two Interfraternity Council colonies, four Asian-interest groups (two fraternities and two sororities), and two new NPHC chapters. 
These groups included 18 percent of the student population, or 1044 undergraduates out of Carnegie Mellon’s 5895.
A total of 274 students joined the 24 chapters of fraternities and sororities in the Carnegie Mellon Greek community this semester.
Bebie in the Student Life Office compiled the data, which was released to President Jared Cohon, associate deans of the university, academic department heads, Division of Student Affairs staff, university administrators, athletics and physical education staff, and student organizations last Friday, Feb. 13.

Last week, Husain Haqqani, Pakistani ambassador to the United States, expressed his optimism regarding the democratic future of Pakistan and the strengthening of U.S.-Pakistan relations as he addressed a packed convocation co-sponsored by Heinz College and the Center for International Politics and Innovation.
The ambassador discussed how the political transitions in both Pakistan and U.S. administrations are likely to shape foreign policies adopted by both nations.
“The U.S. and Pakistan need to establish a strategic relationship based on a shared worldview, and President Obama and Vice President Biden understand that. They know what needs to be done,” said Haqqani.
Silvia Borzutzky, teaching professor of political science and international relations at Heinz College, stated in an e-mail, “Ambassador Haqqani’s discussion of the difficulties involved in Pakistan’s transition to democracy, as well as the expectations that Pakistan has of the new Obama administration, were particularly interesting.”
A former journalist and senior adviser to former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, Haqqani is currently a professor of international relations at Boston University and co-chair of the Hudson Institute’s Project on the Future of the Muslim World. Haqqani is also the author of Pakistan: Between Mosque and Military.
According to Haqqani, the United States has always viewed Pakistan as a “strategic real estate,” from which it can launch its own initiatives without paying much attention to the people of Pakistan.
Pakistan and the United States have been close allies in the war on terror since its launch in 2001. However, the growing Taliban insurgency and al Qaeda safe havens in northern Pakistan, and unauthorized U.S. air strikes in the tribal regions have often soured diplomatic relations between the two countries, Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told CNN’s Stan Grant during an interview last week.
In an attempt to destroy alleged terrorist havens, the U.S. has launched 30 air strikes into northern Pakistan since last September, in which over 200 people were killed, as stated in The Guardian.
“We understand that there are components in Pakistan that have gone extreme, but we have to protect our civilians,” said Haqqani.
Haqqani emphasized the importance of the Kerry-Lugar initiative that promises Pakistan $1.5 billion annually in non-military aid. The aid will be allocated to critical areas like education, infrastructure, environmental efforts, women’s empowerment programs, and entrepreneurial projects.
The K-L initiative is an important building block of a partnership between the U.S. and Pakistan, rather than a short-term military alliance, said Haqqani.
“As the ambassador argued, Pakistan is faced with a large number of challenges and as a result the Obama administration will have to balance many contending interests,” stated Borzutzky.
“Future [U.S.] policies will have to be mindful of the need to preserve Pakistan’s sovereignty, the stability of Pakistan’s new democracy, the future role of the Pakistani military and the security services, and the U.S. strategic needs in the region,” she stated.
“As a Pakistani, I was proud of Ambassador Haqqani’s positive and motivated approach towards the welfare of our country and the rest of the world,” said Madiha Tariq, a master’s student in the Heinz Public Policy and Management program.
With regard to Pakistan’s pivotal role in the international community, Haqqani also stressed the fact that Pakistan is only six decades old and thus a relatively new country.
“The government needs time to learn. People who are living in Pakistan are going through more than a transition; they are going through transformation. We are in the process of rebuilding the institutions of state,” said Haqqani.
Under immense pressure from the United States and opposition parties in Pakistan, former president General Pervez Musharraf was forced to hold democratic elections after nine years of military rule.
“None of Pakistan’s governments have been as inclusive and democratic in the past,” said Haqqani, indicating that democracy in Pakistan may not be an illusion after all.
“It seems like Pakistan is rapidly moving towards democracy,” said Inyoung Song, a research associate at the Department of Social and Decision Sciences. “The ambassador did a great job in making sense of the situation in Pakistan,” she said.
Another major aspect of Pakistan’s transformation plan is the marginalizing of militants and integrating “those areas with pockets of terrorism” into mainstream society, said Haqqani.
On the situation in Swat Valley, now dominated by the Taliban, Haqqani pointed out that the media had summed up a complicated situation into attention-grabbing “sound bytes.”
Recently, the Pakistan government allowed the imposition of the Taliban’s strict interpretation of Shariah in Swat, which permits banning girls from school, women from venturing outside, and any form of entertainment.
“The government of Pakistan has not negotiated with the Taliban militants,” said Haqqani, but with the indigenous people of Swat who have long sought a system dictated by Shariah.
“Our purpose is to drive a wedge between the Taliban and the indigenous people,” said Haqqani.
The Pakistan government announced a permanent ceasefire between the Pakistan Army and the Swat Taliban on Saturday. 
However, according Reuters news report, Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah told an illegal FM radio, “We heard that the government announced a permanent ceasefire, but we have announced a 10-day ceasefire and we will consider an extension when it ends.”
“The distinction made here between the Swati Taliban and the indigenous group is an important issue,” said Tariq.
“If this is the real on-ground situation, then the Pakistani media must be allowed to enter the region and report it. Until we do not hear what the civilians of Swat have to say about this, we cannot be certain that this is the right move,” Tariq also said.
The Ambassador also talked about India’s important role in Pakistan’s transformation.
“India and Pakistan can work together in areas of education, energy, and cultural development,” said Haqqani.
Haqqani also said that despite the geopolitical odds faced by Pakistan, it has the capacity to turn them around for its own and others’ benefit.
“Pakistan may be at the crossroads of conflict, but it is also at the crossroads of opportunity,” he said.

College music services, such as Ruckus, were created in order to provide college students with the services that they wanted to listen to and watch. 
Ruckus wanted to offer a legal alternative to piracy for students at all campuses around the nation. 
Ruckus allowed students to stream and download an unlimited amount of music and share music with their schoolmates. 
However, about two weeks ago, on Feb. 6, Ruckus officially shut down.
Initially, Ruckus started off as a subscription service, in which consumers paid a monthly fee to access the music and videos available on the website. 
However, Ruckus changed its policy to partner with more than 200 major universities to provide these colleges with a free and legal alternative to unauthorized file swapping. 
In addition, Ruckus began to receive all of its funds not from subscriptions, but from ads, which enabled the site to give free access to students. 
Eventually, Ruckus opened all of its facilities to any student with an official university e-mail address (usually ending in “.edu”). 
However, faculty, staff, and alumni were still charged $8.95 per month for the service. 
Even though Ruckus made a huge effort to inform university administration members about the importance of legal music streaming, not enough university students took advantage of Ruckus’s services.
A Ruckus official explained that the company has officially played its last song. 
He explained that although the audience was fairly good, the money coming in from ads was slowly decreasing.
Some students who tested out Ruckus’s service complained that Ruckus was not completely useful to them because the music tracks were DRMed WMP files, which meant that the songs were not iPod or Zune-friendly. 
The students didn’t like that they couldn’t download music to listen to wherever and whenever they wanted to. 
They were restricted to listening to the music they liked at only their PCs, because Ruckus was also not available on Apple computers. 
Other students who tested Ruckus out for one year liked Ruckus’s other available social networking features, such as shared playlists, message boards, and song recommendations between peers. 
One student also liked the fact that the Ruckus service had a great music library that was easy to use and readily available. 
However, despite Ruckus’s pitch that the songs were completely free, many students did not like the fact that the music lacked usability. 
Even free music, students felt, is no use when they can’t listen to it wherever, however, and on whatever music device they want. 
Sophomore English and creative writing major Chloe Perkins said that she would also “be less inclined to use a service like Ruckus” if she couldn’t put the songs onto her iPod, because she listens to music most while she’s on the go rather than when she’s sitting at her computer.
First-year H&SS student Joyce Chung said that she would prefer sites like YouTube over Ruckus because Ruckus is shared among college students, while YouTube is “easily accessible, includes a wealth of information, and many more people around the globe use it.” 
Chung also attributed to Ruckus’s downfall to a “lack of promotion, marketing, and publicity.” 
She felt that sites like YouTube or iTunes offer many more unique services, applications, and features that she is satisfied with. 
On the other hand, first-year professional writing major Hannah Post stated that she thinks “college music services are effective, because file sharing within a campus community gives students a widespread collection of music and features.”
Post also said that she would prefer campus file-sharing over sites like YouTube or iTunes, because on iTunes, you have to purchase your music, whereas on a college music program, the service is free, and because she feels as though you can have more control of your music on a college music service than on YouTube, where you can only watch videos.
The sudden shutdown of Ruckus reminded some officials of two years ago, when another college music service, Cdigix, also abruptly announced the end of its music services. 
Cdigix was a company that initially offered an online music service for colleges, but after that ended, it re-geared itself and became focused on selling a service to colleges to place movies and music on reserve online. 
However, Cdigix cited that it had a lack of clients and an inability to raise enough money to continue operating, even with its movies and music reserves system. At this point, after one too many music service failures, officials are beginning to think that the whole business model for campus music services isn’t working, and they want to create something totally different. 
Perkins thought that maybe Congress could invest in some specific companies to make a file-sharing system, or if that didn’t work, then maybe they could provide money to the companies to provide rebates to students who bought and shared music on a file-sharing website.
Despite the music industry’s failure to create an efficient, popular, and legal alternative to file swapping, the music industry did succeed in something else: persuading Congress that colleges needed to control the amount of music piracy on their campuses. 
According to an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education, Congress renewed a new provision in the Higher Education Act last year, which requires colleges to offer alternatives to illegal downloading. 
However, the meaning of this vague requirement is still unclear, and the U.S. Department of Education is just beginning to draft specific regulations about what this provision means.

Last Tuesday, President Obama signed a $787 billion economic stimulus package into law, saying that it would “set our economy on a firmer foundation.” Some economists, such as National Economic Council director Larry Summers, support the economic stimulus to counter the economic downturn. Other economists, including James M. Buchanan and Robert Lucas Jr., say that it will increase unemployment and place more debt on future generations. Here are some statistics about the stimulus package:
Number of Representatives voted in favor: 246
Number of Representatives voted against: 183
Percent of the package to be spent on tax cuts: 40
Amount of money the package spends on higher education: $32 billion
Estimated number of jobs the package can create or save: 3.5 million

[BOLD]Humanities presents film festival[BOLD]
The Humanities Center presents its 2009 International Film Festival, “Faces of Realism,” Feb. 26–March 8.
“Faces of Realism” encourages audiences to examine how reality is portrayed through nine feature and documentary films from six different countries. 
Screenings will take place at the South Side Works Theater and Pittsburgh Filmmakers locations in addition to McConomy Auditorium at Carnegie Mellon. 
This year, the festival takes a new approach to film by screening [ITAL]Bomb It![ITAL], a documentary on the history and culture of graffiti.
Along with post-screening receptions, this festival features various workshops with such directors as Antonio Campos,and Azazel Jacobs, as well as cinematographer Arthur Reinhart. 
Campos will conduct a workshop on realism in relation to his short film [ITAL]Buy It Now[ITAL], which tells the story of a 16-year-old girl who sells her virginity on eBay to the highest bidder. Campos will dissect performance, camera work, editing, and the use of video clips in both [ITAL]Buy It Now[ITAL] and the festival feature [ITAL]Afterschool[ITAL].
Opening night includes a screening of [ITAL]Il Divo[ITAL] at 7:30 p.m. in the Pittsburgh Filmmakers’ Melwood Screening Room. The film, directed by Paolo Sorrentino, is a character study of seven-time Italian Prime Minister Guilio Andreotti. Tony Buba, an internationally acclaimed director from Braddock, Pa., will introduce the film.
[BOLD]University honored for service[BOLD]
Carnegie Mellon has been named to the President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll for exemplary community service efforts by the Corporation for National and Community Service. 
Launched in 2006, the Community Service Honor Roll is the highest federal recognition a school can achieve for its commitment to service learning and civic engagement.
The Leonard Gelfand Center for Service Learning and Outreach, under the direction of Assistant Vice Provost for Educational Outreach Judith Hallinen, supports more than 75 university-wide programs for K-12 students and teachers. 
It is aimed at improving and enhancing the teaching and learning process. 
Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, and staff are active participants in its many outreach initiatives, including professional development programs for teachers and administrators, and enrichment courses for students. 
The center works to connect university students to volunteer and paid positions that allow them to develop expertise while meeting the needs of local agencies and individuals.
Hallinen said in a press release that she documented more than 88,000 hours of service to the community during the last academic year.

The SciTech article "Energy economist lectures at Carnegie Mellon" (Feb. 9) wrongly stated that "the internal combustion of the engine is inefficient." It should have read, "the internal combustion engine is inefficient." Also, in the same article, the quote "the potential for impact on the total energy need" was wrongly attributed to Peter Tertzakian. The statement belonged to the writer.

Rules: Once you’ve been tagged, you are supposed to write a note with 25 random things, useless facts, boring habits, or trivial goals that relate to you and your life. At the end, choose 25 people to be burdened with this mundane task. You have to tag the person who tagged you because they have done you the honor of inflicting this narcissistic pain upon you. If I tagged you, it’s because I want to know more about you, and doing it via a Facebook note is far more personal than having an actual conversation.
1.) I think that thinking of 25 things about yourself and publishing it on Facebook for the whole Internet has got to be the most strenuously vain activity possible. Why? Read on.
2.) You never stop learning youthful memories of other people’s childhood past: “When I was five, I wanted to go to the moon so I could do endless backflips.” When you were five, you probably also got bored on 20-minute car trips and thought the moon was a Buzz Lightyear away, so…
3.) The next involves the blatant advertisement of likes and dislikes. You “just can’t stand” mushy bananas? No one except for the nice man at the Saturday morning farmer’s market cares about how you can’t stand mushy bananas. Actually, he probably doesn’t care either. No one. No one cares.
4.) Ever get one of those sappy all-encompassing feel-good statements? “My favorite things in the world all begin with the letter ‘f’: Faith, family, friends, food, and football.” Hey, you forgot the all-essential “Facebook.”
5.) Only in an extended self-centered note can you be totally appalled over and over by people’s creative spelling: “histerical,” “earings,” “mermades.” Come on, Dictionary.com is just a tab and a click away.
6.) Once in a while, you’ll find a really worthwhile fact — a useful hint, if you will: “My hands get really really sweaty.” The rest of us will know for the next handshake.
7.) Reading some people’s notes makes you want to do good in the world. At the same time, you just may choke on the sappiness: “I can’t imagine my life without him. He means everything to me and I don’t know what I did before meeting him.” He loves you too, but probably cringed at seeing this.
8.) If you ever need reassurance, reading the note is cheaper than therapy. “I think my head is really big and my ears are abnormally long.” Superficial reassurance is just a couple of “No way! You are so proportional you make Jessica Alba look disproportional!” comments away. By the way, that Facebook friend hasn’t seen you in four years. Spot on.
9.) Feel free to reveal embarrassing things: “I’m secretly in love with Justin Timberlake. He’s so dreamy!” Now the world knows! Well, at least your 25 people do.
10.) “Okay, okay... I gave in... peer pressure... here are my 25 things.” You’re no better than those who eagerly did it right away. You know you wanted to right from the start.
...
25.) I couldn’t actually think of 25 things for this article. I wish I cared more.
Cynthia Peng (cynthiap@) did hours of research for this article. It was unbelievably boring.

I would like to take a moment to address the new craze that is sweeping the world — at super speed, might I add. And before you ask, no, it’s not a plane, train, or even Superman. Instead, it’s a new, slightly darker kind of superhero who’s going to save the world, seemingly with his or her devastatingly good looks. Welcome to the world of vampires and werewolves, created by Stephenie Meyer in her Twilight trilogy.
If, by some chance, you don’t know the basic premise of the story (though I’m not sure how you wouldn’t, when every other Facebook bumper sticker over the summer proclaimed the creator’s love for Edward), I’ll take a moment to sum it up for you quickly. Bella, a 17-year-old girl who moves to Forks, Wash. to live with her father, falls head-over-heels in love with Edward Cullen, a vampire who is uncontrollably attracted to the scent of her blood. The catch is, though, the Edward and the rest of his family are “vegetarian” vampires, who only drink animal blood, not human blood, and thus Edward must resist the temptation to bite Bella, and instead, his desire for her blood transforms into love. You know, just your normal, run-of-the-mill high school experience.
I will admit to reading the series, and then getting my sister, friends, and even mom to read them as well. My dad decided that he had to see what the excitement was about (we may have obsessively talked about the books for a few weeks over the summer) and tried to read them as well, but couldn’t make it past the first book. They’re definitely an addicting read, don’t get me wrong, mostly because every girl who reads the books wants to be Bella or wants Edward to be real. Who wouldn’t want a boyfriend who was gorgeous beyond all belief and always said and did the right thing? Okay, so maybe explained like that it suddenly doesn’t sound so attractive, but when you’re reading the books, Edward is definitely swoon-worthy.
As much as I enjoyed the books, however, I need to say that I think the obsession has reached a new level that I never dreamed would happen. In addition to special editions of the books, the movie (which hasn’t even been released on DVD yet), multiple sets of Twilight dolls, and a perfume (with a bottle design that looks remarkably similar to Nina Ricci’s), the Twilight mania has crossed from the world of merchandise into the real world. The obsession no longer stops with products that you can buy. Now, instead of teens hoping for vacations to Myrtle Beach or NYC, there’s a new destination vacation: Forks, Wash.
What’s there to see in Forks, you might ask? Well, lots of rain and clouds, some fishing, and oh, that’s right, you can go visit “Bella’s” or “Edward’s” house. Yes, that’s right, Forks is taking complete advantage of an opportunity it was handed on a silver platter, and now even the city’s Chamber of Commerce website guides visitors to places of interest for those on both Team Edward and Team Jacob. Tourists can now stop by Bella’s house and pose for a picture with her pick-up truck (as long as they don’t bother the actual residents of the house, of course), or swing by Edward’s house and check out what Esme, his mother, has written about what the family is up to that day. And don’t forget, if you happen to be there in September, you can go to the high school and celebrate Bella’s birthday with town residents and other tourists who have gathered just for the occasion!
Yes, this is all 100 percent serious, and yes, people are actually going here and doing these things. As much as I enjoyed the books (and daydreaming about Edward), I think this whole craze has gone too far. Are people forgetting that these “artifacts” that they’re going to see aren’t even real, and not only are they not real, they’re replicas of fictional things! Why spend your time and money to go see something that was meant to be imagined in your head? I just cannot wrap my mind around going to a real city to see made-up things that the city has created just to draw in tourists — which, admittedly, is a smart move on the part of Forks, but a dumb move on the parts of the people that actually go to see it.
Twilight fans need to take a step back and enjoy the books and characters for what they are and how Meyer created them instead of trekking to a backwoods town to see other people’s visions of the people and things in a book. Seeing “Bella’s” truck or “Edward’s” house isn’t going to make them any more real. Have some imagination please, people.
Heather Tomko (htomko@), while admittedly an avid Twilight fan, vows to never travel to Forks and pose with a pick-up truck.

Hearts sink in Swat, Pakistan as young girls see their future up in flames. Classroom walls that were once adorned with painted flowers and butterflies are now charred with the fires of illiteracy and fundamentalism. Libraries, playrooms, and school clinics have all taken the form of ruins since the large-scale violence inflicted by the Taliban on the region that was once fondly known as the “Switzerland” of Asia, and is now most aptly referred to as the “lost paradise.” 
According to Sher Afzal Khan, the district head of the Education Department, 187 schools in Swat have either been burned down or bombed, of which 121 were girls’ schools, within a period of 20 months. The most recent attacks destroyed over 50 schools, including any that tried to reopen, disrupting months of these children’s education. 
Classroom photographs taken prior to the destruction show girls seated in neat uniforms, with an earnest enthusiasm in their eyes to broaden their horizons — a desire to learn that is being crushed by the Taliban. I find the thought of education being denied to me highly inconceivable. As a Pakistani, I find it to be a criminal act committed against my country, preparing it for a menacingly bleak future. And as a Muslim woman, I find it to be the most obnoxious violation of my basic rights and freedoms.
Historically, Islam was one of the first religions to acknowledge women. In fact, the concept of “women’s rights” was never realized as a movement the way it was in the West, simply because it was inherent in the religion. Education, for both men and women, is not an option or an opportunity in Islam; it is a responsibility and a duty toward oneself as well as toward society. To educate oneself and battle ignorance is forbidden nowhere in Islam, but only in the selfish sociopolitical agendas of fundamentalist groups. 
Groups condemning women’s education are not a recent phenomenon in Pakistan, nor is it limited to the Taliban. While most of the urban population progressed with time, many rural areas, such as Gujrat and Meerwala, are still infested with individuals and “councils” that advocate illiteracy among women. Naturally, with the rise of the Taliban, this counterproductive attitude has managed to intensify among certain people. 
No wonder then, even after 60 years of independence, Pakistan’s literacy rate is only 50 percent — a consequence of denying women the right to an education.
Though they face poor odds, many young girls have not lost hope or courage. Living examples of such great strength are 19-year-old Shamsia and 16-year-old Atifa from Kandahar, Afghanistan, who were attacked and scorched with acid by Taliban militants on their way to school. Even as she suffeed from severe acid burns, Shamsia told CNN that she will not leave school and her “greatest revenge will be an education.” 
Many continue to discriminate against women by burning down girls’ schools or preventing them from leading a healthy lifestyle by banning physical activities like yoga (yes, a group of Malaysia’s leading Islamic clerics has actually prohibited women from practicing yoga). But this kind of chauvinism masked by Islam is only further strengthening Muslim women, giving them more incentive and fueling their thirst for the best, most holistic educational experience possible.
While the government of Pakistan claims that its recent truce, which legalizes the Talibanization along with the Taliban’s interpretation of Shariah, is not an act of negotiation with the Taliban but with the indigenous administration, the Pakistani media and secretly given civilian accounts indicate quite the opposite. 
In this situation, I cannot help but wonder what the people of Swat want. As a young girl, in addition to my British school curriculum, I was home-tutored in Islamic studies by an elderly gentleman from Swat who was by no means an extremist or a religious pedagogue adamant on teaching me the tenets of hatred. In fact, he simultaneously gave me lessons in Urdu and mathematics, courses I could only miraculously pass in school. At this point, I can’t imagine that man, who was also a practicing Muslim, a scholar, and advocate of Islamic thought, approving this criminal injustice that is being inflicted upon the people of Swat.
If what the people want is the imposition of strict Shariah, which according to the interpretation of the region’s Taliban allows them to deny basic rights like education to girls, why are there anonymous protests from citizens? If this is their dream society, why did they flee by the thousands? Almost one-third of the 1.5 million have fled Swat and migrated to major cities like Karachi and Lahore, working menial jobs to support their families, or have found refuge in Afghan refugee camps in the North West Frontier province. 
After the government declared a permanent ceasefire on Saturday, the Taliban continue to decide among themselves whether they will cooperate with the government or wreak havoc in the region. While boys’ schools will reopen next week, a decision for the continuation of girls’ schools is still a “topic under discussion,” says a CNN report. 
It is disgraceful that the future of the women of Pakistan should even remotely be determined by unfairly and illegally constructed laws of the Taliban.
Marium Chandna (mchandna@) supports those brave young girls who have vowed to tackle all constraints and educate themselves.

Over the past few weeks, a bothersome presence has become the companion to one of our campus's most visible traditions. The 60-year-old sycamore tree that stands next to the Fence was covered with splashes of color and random Greek letters.
While the practice of fence-painting has been encouraged by Carnegie Mellon’s administration, the Student Life Office is decidedly less than amused when that tradition leads to defacement of university property. The guidelines are put in place to provide students with an opportunity for expression and are there to encourage student's creativity, not to encourage destruction of university property and plant life.
Before the Fence was reconstructed in 1993, the tree was directly adjacent to and in front of the Fence. Photos from the time show paint from the fence slowly creeping onto the tree’s bark, due to their proximity to each other, but the tree was never purposely painted before. What message do we send when a group of visitors walks through the heart of campus and finds a graffitied tree? Not only does it make our campus look sloppy, it also makes it seem like the students and faculty of Carnegie Mellon do not care about the environment, when they clearly do. In addition, putting paint on some trees can result in their eventual death.
But the sycamore was not the only victim of this month’s paint job. The Fence itself had what appeared to be spare paint dumped haphazardly onto its posts, in contrast to the rules that specifically define the only proper method for paint application to be direct application with hand brushes. From this, we can only conclude that the offenders didn’t show up that night seeking to share some message with the campus community.
According to David Wessell, Facilities Management Services’ grounds and labor supervisor, there isn’t anything that can be done to remove the paint from the tree. The tree will be left for the weather and its natural bark-peeling process to remove the effects of this month’s act of vandalism.

Earlier this month, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, better known as the stimulus package, was released to the public, passed by the House and the Senate, and signed into law by President Obama.
But what are the details of this nearly $790 billion plan? About 34 percent is direct tax cuts. The rest is nearly all spending, from defense to the environment, from government technology to housing. And, according to the Congressional Budget Office, about 74 percent of that $500 billion of spending will be spent in the next year-and-a-half.
But what do we care about most? $92 billion has been allocated for education, from child-care centers up to universities. $40 billion has been put toward energy, much of which is targeted at renewable energy, energy efficiency, and alternative energy research. Scientific research has been given $17 billion, much of which is additional research funding for award granting agencies such like the National Institute of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF).
However, many of the details of the bill are in the specifics presented in the 1071-page document, and not all of them are exactly economically driven. For example, the details surrounding the funding to the Health Information Technology section include security breach notifications involving health information, and additional reporting requirements that broaden the Health Insurance Portability & Protection Act (HIPPA).
One worrisome statement that thankfully never made it into the final version of the bill was proposed language by Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that would “allow for reasonable network management practices such as deterring unlawful activity, including child pornography and copyright infringement.” This statement would have served as a starter for larger and broader anti-net neutrality behavior, and we are relieved to see that it was not included.
Another detail that did not make it into the bill, but was released later in the Executive Office’s “Recovery Act Implementation Guide,” was that each agency is “required to provide a feed (preferred: Atom 1.0, acceptable: RSS)” of the allocation it is completing, along with a weekly report. In non-techie speak, this means that every time each agency gives out money, it would post, in a manner similar to a blog entry, how much money was given out from the agency and to whom, and this post would then be able to be imported into sites like Facebook, in the form of a Facebook note.
We appreciate this (clearly forced) expansion of the Obama administration’s use of technology to help make the spending of the recovery bill more transparent. This attempt at transparency relating to finances will be incredibly important as the spending, in what is the largest government spending push since World War II, occurs in an attempt to restart our nation’s economic growth.

The Tartan’s Editorial Board, in its Feb. 2 statement of support for The Weekly Slant has, in its haste to congratulate it for merely existing, turned a blind eye to the newsletter’s obvious lack of journalistic standards, unfounded accusations and implications, and anonymous editorial staff-of-one.
“More journalism is more journalism,” writes the Board. One student prints out an 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper without the review of an editorial process, without naming himself, without accountability, and the largest, oldest, and most influential publication at Carnegie Mellon University is ready to give him an unconditional thumbs-up in the name of “journalism”?
When the conservative newspaper The Flipside appeared on campus, the Editorial Board and I were equally concerned and excited. While we were enthusiastic to have a new publication in our midst, we were nonetheless adamant that “all campus-wide publications should be held to high standards of journalistic integrity.”
Now, however, it seems the Board will give a free pass to anyone with a printing quota and an axe to grind.
I understand well that the right to autonomous speech is protected by respectable organizations like the ACLU, the Associated Collegiate Press, and the Student Press Law Center. However, there is a proper method to follow and set of standards that must be met for acceptable anonymous satire, and The Weekly Slant certainly does not come close.

Hey Tartans,
With Spring Break only a few weeks away, I’d like to update you on an initiative that Pooja and I have been working on throughout the school year — changes to our dining program. I’d like to update you on the work of the Student Government Dining Task Force and also the current Request for Proposal (RFP) process for a potential new dining vendor.
The dining program on campus has been an issue that I have felt passionate about since I first became a Student Senator during my freshman year. In November, Pooja and I formed a dining task force, composed of Student Senators and Graduate Student Assembly Representatives, to evaluate the state of the dining program and to propose possible solutions. 
While I don’t have the space to review them all, some of these goals included making DineX roll over per semester, making a 24/7 eatery (happening already in Maggie Murph!), creating a semester coffee cup program in Entropy+, and making more communal dining in the University Center. Both Vice President Murphy and Director of Housing and Dining Kim Abel have met with the task force and read through the report. If you would like to see the report in its entirety, please feel free to visit our website — stugov.andrew.cmu.edu/executive — or contact me directly.
Besides the task force, we’ve also been very busy in the RFP process. Many of the dining locations on campus are operated under one vendor, Parkhurst. With Parkhurst’s contract about to expire, Abel invited several companies to submit proposals on why they should be our future dining partner.
Three of those companies — Parkhurst, Sodexo, and CulinArt — submitted proposals, and throughout the last week they came to campus and made their case as to why they believe they are the right fit for Carnegie Mellon. If this doesn’t seem like a that big of a deal to you, please think again. We’re talking about revolutionizing dining operations on our campus. One vendor mentioned bringing an Einstein Bros. Bagels, some have talked about touch-screen ordering, others have mentioned better nutritional and sustainable practices, etc.
One last thing: Don’t forget to submit petitions (at the UC Info Desk) by March 3 to run for SBP, SBVPF, or Senate. Besides the fact that having a representative voice for the students is that important, I think that, like me, you’ll find that you can really enjoy your time in these roles as well. Good luck with midterms!
