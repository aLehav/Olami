As the Summer Rio Olympics ends, a number of superstars have come out with more than a handful of medals: Michael Phelps, Katie Ledecky, Simone Biles, and Usain Bolt to name a few. After years of rigorous training, endless sacrifices, and often multiple injuries, attending the Olympics is the measure of ultimate success; winning a medal is the icing on the cake. However, not all prizes are created equal. 
Besides fame and an Olympic medallion, Olympic medalists can also win cash prizes from their country’s National Olympic Committee. In the United States, gold medalists will earn $25,000, silver medalists $15,000 and bronze medalists $10,000. The United States Olympic Committee gave out $1.8 million in cash prizes for the 105 medals won by American athletes. 
However, these cash prizes are taxed by the United States government based on the athlete’s income bracket. Simone Biles, who won 4 gold and a bronze medal will have to pay $43,560 in taxes and Michael Phelps will have to pay up to $55,540. 
So which country offers the most money for winning gold? Singaporean Joseph Schooling, who defeated Michael Phelps to win the gold in the 10 meter butterfly will receive one million Singaporean dollars (US$743,108), the largest prize money from any country. Indonesia offers $342,000 per gold medalist and both Azerbaijian and Kazakhstan also offer a whopping $250,000 for each gold medalists. 
Prizes can extend past cash as well. In the past, Russia has offered luxury cars to Olympic medalists and in South Korea medalists can be exempt from compulsory military service. Germany offers a lifetime supply of beer and Belarus offers unlimited sausages. 
However, if you are from Great Britain, Norway, Sweden, or Croatia, don’t expect any prizes at all. None of these countries offer cash bonuses for winning an Olympic medal. 
So if you're looking to become an Olympic athlete and make big money, the country you compete for makes a big difference in what you could earn. Of course, Olympic athletes generally cannot choose what country they compete for so they have to take what they can get. Regardless of cash prize, medal-winning Olympic athletes are always held in high esteem in their home countries, and some would say respect is the ultimate prize.

On Aug. 22, the Carnegie Mellon athletics department announced a partnership with ESPNWilliamsport.com to broadcast the home competitions of the Tartan football team, as well as the men’s and women’s basketball teams.
ESPN Williamsport is the primary station and online platform for multiple professional sports teams, as well as numerous NCAA colleges and universities in four states.
ESPN Williamsport owner and general manager Todd Bartley noted, “The prestigious name of Carnegie Mellon University was enough to get my attention when the opportunity to serve Tartans athletics presented itself.” The recent success of Carnegie Mellon’s sports teams was also surely a factor in the formation of this new partnership. 
Carnegie Mellon director of Athletics Josh Centor has high hopes for this partnership, and said “We expect that this collaboration will allow us to share our student-athletes’ achievements with a broader cross-section of the Carnegie Mellon community.”
Bartley announced that coverage will begin on Sept. 3, as the Tartan football team takes on the Washington University of St. Louis in Gesling Stadium. Brian Collins will announce the game for ESPN Williamsport. On the opportunity to call the games for the Tartans, Collins said “Just the absolute tradition of this prestigious school and the rich history has me excited and privileged to be a part of it this fall.” Collins has casted for multiple sports at every level of collegiate play, and has more than 20 years of experience. Collins also has multiple coaching accolades along with his experience in broadcasting, and will surely make a great addition to the broadcast team.
This partnership can only benefit the Tartan sports teams, giving them public exposure and allowing for the growth of the Tartan brand. Not only that, but fans of Carnegie Mellon’s sports teams will be able to watch these competitions from anywhere in the world.
The Carnegie Mellon webcasts will use the audio feed from ESPNWilliamsport.com, and an audio only stream will also be available through ESPNWilliamsport.com as well as http://athletics.cmu.edu.

Football
This Saturday Sept. 3, the Carnegie Mellon football team will take on the Bears of the University of Washington at St. Louis. The last time these rival teams met was almost a full year ago. The Tartans did not fare well in that contest, losing 45-24. The Tartans would lose two of their next three games after that before going on a seven game win streak to close out the season. The Tartans transformed in the weeks after playing Washington University, putting up record-breaking offensive numbers with the help of star running back Sam Benger. With that in mind, the Tartans are expected to beat the Bears in the first competition of the year. With a large group of returning players on the field for the Tartans, the veteran experience coupled with the chemistry built in last season’s win streak could carry the Tartans to another record-breaking season. While the Tartans finished last season on a strong note, they will be looking to improve on their success and eventually get into the NCAA tournament to play for a national championship. Saturday will be their first test of many.
Soccer
The Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team will take on Muskingum University at home on Thursday, Sept. 1. If last year’s meeting between these two teams is any indication of how this year’s match will go, then the Tartans are expected to win handily. These teams met last year on the exact same day, and the Tartans dominated Muskingum by a score line of 8-0. The Tartans did not end last season on a high note after losing their final two competitions, but after an offseason of hard practice they are surely hungry to get back on a roll. Muskingum should be a nice warm up game for the Tartan men, allowing them to flex their muscles and go into the season with an aura of confidence about them. They should not get complacent however, because Muskingum will still show up to play and cannot be underestimated. If the Tartans just play their game calm and controlled, they should win easily.
Carnegie Mellon’s women’s soccer team will take on Franciscan University at home on Friday, Sept. 2 at 7 p.m. This is an interesting matchup because these teams did not meet at all last season, so it’s really anyone’s game. The Tartan women finished last season with an astounding 17-2-1 record, so they are not used to losing. That said, their season was cut short in the third round of the NCAA tournament in a heartbreaking overtime loss to Calvin, 1-0. That left the Tartan women with a bad taste in their mouth, and they’ll be looking to cleanse their palette in the first match of the season against a brand new opponent. The women of Franciscan University finished last season with a 6-8-2 record, so they can only improve on last season. If the Tartan women perform anywhere close to the level they did last season, they should handily beat the Barons of Franciscan University and begin the 2016 season on a high note.

Scientists identify Proxima b, an Earth-like planet
Years of research have led an international team of scientists to the discovery of Proxima b, a rocky exoplanet close to Earth. With instruments at the European Southern Observatory in Chile, the scientists studied the emission of light from Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the sun and the center of orbit for Proxima b. 
According to Guillem Anglada-Escudé, a co-author from Queen Mary University of London, observation of the changes in color in Proxima Centauri led to deductions about the distance of Proxima b from the star as well as the mass of the planet.
Located within the habitable zone of the star, Proxima b exhibits characteristics that would make it hospitable for life, although no evidence exists to confirm that the planet possesses an atmosphere or water. Although the planet is far from human reach, scientists are eager to study more about it and possibly unlock details about alien life along the way. The findings on the planet were published in Nature.

Ultrasound may help the brain recover after coma
As reported in the journal Brain Stimulations, researchers led by Martin Monti at University of California, Los Angeles found that a 25-year-old man demonstrated significant recovery from a coma after they treated him with a low-intensity focused ultrasound pulsation. 
This is the first time this technique has been used to treat severe brain injury. The noninvasive technique involves sonic stimulation of the neurons located in the thalamus, the part of the brain that processes information and is often impaired after a coma.
During the procedure a device that emitted energy was placed next to the patient’s head. After the treatment, the man showed improvements in his consciousness and speech. If replicated in future studies, the results of this technique could prove to be effective in helping patients recover from comas. The device could be made into a helmet that is both portable and low-cost.

Large storm sends elusive S waves across the Earth
In the Chugoku region of southern Japan seismologists have detected an S wave, a faint deep-Earth tremor, which was triggered by a severe distant storm in the Atlantic Ocean. Involved in the study was Kiwamu Nishida and Ryota Takagi, from the University of Tokyo and Tohoku University respectively. 
The researchers employed a network of seismic sensors to detect and sum the multiple faint signals collected, allowing them to trace the S wave to its origin for the first time. Peter Bromirski of the University of California San Diego, who wrote commentary in the issue of Science in which the research was published, stated that the ability to detect S waves, in addition to the less elusive P waves, would allow for the location of new seismic sources in the middle of the Pacific. 
In turn, geologists could use the waves to learn more about the innermost layers of the Earth, including its structure and composition.

Pokémon GO app dwindles recently in number of users
More than a month after its release by Niantic, Pokémon GO appears to be declining in popularity. Axiom Capital Management estimates that the number of daily active users of the game went from 45 million to 30 million between mid-July and mid-August.
According to Craig Chapple, editor of mobile games trade publication PocketGamer.Biz, the decline is to be expected in the aftermath of the initial hype over the game. Part of the decline may also be attributed to Niantic’s controversial removal of the “nearby” feature in the application. With less users, concern exists about the impacts on the social aspect of the game.
Regardless of whether users will stick to playing the game in the long run, Pokémon GO still remains a top-grossing application in most countries. In addition, the future release of the game in many more countries, including parts of Asia and Africa, may improve the usage statistics for the game.

Engineers create first autonomous, entirely soft robot
Researchers at Harvard University led by Robert Wood and Jennifer A. Lewis have developed the first fully autonomous, soft-bodied robot. It is called the octobot, as it carries the shape of an octopus, a creature that moves powerfully without an internal skeleton and, hence, has been an inspiration for the soft robotics field. The research findings were published in the journal Nature.
Unlike previous soft-bodied robots, the octobot contains no rigid parts, such as batteries, wires, or circuit boards. Instead, the movement of the octobot is fueled by liquid hydrogen peroxide, which reacts with a platinum catalyst to produce gas. The gas then goes into the arms of the octobot and inflates them. A microfluidic logic circuit is used to control the amount of hydrogen peroxide that is turned into gas.
The simplicity, yet novelty, of the researcher’s approach has laid the foundation for more complex designs in the future.

Washington State permits killing of roaming wolf pack
After feeding on local livestock, an entire pack of endangered gray wolves are now authorized to be exterminated, according to a recent statement issued by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW). At least 11 of the wolves had been roaming in Profanity Peak in Ferry County, including six adults and five pups.
Earlier this month, two female wolves were shot after wildlife biologists found that they caused the death and injuries of five cows in a grazing area. As a result, the cow attacks temporarily ceased. Since then, three more attacks by wolves has been reported, prompting the WDFW’s decision to take further action. 
Despite protest from local conservation groups, the agency stated that in addition to its efforts to maintain the wolf population, it also had a responsibility to protect livestock from repeated attacks from the wolves

The United States Department of Energy (DOE) Geothermal Technologies Office partnered with the Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES) and Idaho National Laboratory (INL) earlier this spring to highlight the value and potential of geothermal energy. Together, they hosted a competition for high school and university students to create infographics.
There were over 100 teams comprising of two to three students that entered the competition, and a committee of engineers, energy experts, and creative professionals selected the winners.
This year, the grand prize winner for the Geothermal Design Challenge was Infinity Below, a team composed of Carnegie Mellon students. The students, Marisa Lu, Tiffany Lai and Susie Lee, are sophomores in the School of Design.
“I’ve always been interested in environmental issues and led the environmental club back in high school, as well as campaigning with Environment Maryland and the Maryland Public Interest Research Group on related policies,” Lu said in a university press release. “When I heard about this competition, I jumped on the opportunity to combine my personal passions and past experiences.”
“Personally, I believe our infographic had an edge because we addressed all sorts of energy sources. This way, we showed the audience what the information we were giving was up against,” Lai said in an interview with The Tartan. 
Lee used this opportunity to spread the word about alternative energy sources.
“Nature provides us with so much energy, why do we have to keep using nonrenewable ones like fossil fuels?” Lee said in the press release. 
“Getting other people aware of the resources that surround us is one step closer to being not so dependent on sources that won’t be able to provide for much longer. Energy is the provider for function in our society. Why not fuel it for something that is clean both ethically and environmentally?”
In an interview with The Tartan, Lu agreed with her teammate. 
“I think energy is a topic that needs to be communicated better because it is what enables us to have the lifestyles that we do, yet it’s something we never give a second thought to until there’s something wrong with it,” Lu said.
Their winning design was an infographic entitled, “Our Energy Future? A Down to Earth Solution,” with a landscape depicting energy from the sun to the core of the earth.
“As I understand it, energy plays a big role in how societies function, and subsequently influences what sort of long term relationship we have with our environment,” Lu said in an interview with The Tartan. “Geothermal energy has not only great potential to reshape that relationship, but also to positively impact our international policies and socioeconomic landscape. The ideal future energy landscape is one that has just as much breadth in positive impacts. An ideal future energy scape would be one that cultivates good environmental stewardship, creates thousands of new jobs, and revitalizes the economy while providing cheap, American grown energy that we can trust to be clean and available for many generations to come.”
The infographic starts with a percentage distribution of the current United States electricity generation sources. Geothermal energy is currently the least used energy source, at 0.4 percent, and coal is currently the most used energy source at 38.7 percent. The infographic moves to types of sources for electricity in the United States in 2050, claiming that geothermal won’t expand until technology makes it more cost effective upfront.
The infographic then moves to the operation cost of geothermal versus other energy sources, stating that geothermal has stable prices because it doesn’t need foreign fuel to operate.
“I think something risky our team decided to do was incorporate information about other types of energy, so that our infographic wasn’t only focused on geothermal energy,” Lai said in the press release. “We wanted to be realistic. We depicted statistics about current energy sources and what their status would be in the future.”
“In the visual storytelling of our infographic, we all agreed that while we had separate/different info blurbs to emphasize, we needed them to still be able to come together to form a bigger picture for both informational and visual coherence,” Lu told The Tartan. 
“From a selling point, we believed an infographic that forms one picture overall catches the viewers attention faster without turning them off with too much text. It’s what I believe set our infographic apart; ours is easy to view and glean information from at varying distances. So even the uninterested, unengaged viewer, would be able to get something out of it because the information we provide doesn’t need text to be understood.”
The infographic ends with the claim, “With potential to make positive impact economically, socially, environmentally, and research racing to make Enhanced Geothermal Systems cost effective, where do you see our future?”
All three students credit the School of Design in helping prepare them for this competition.
“I am happy and grateful to have been able to contribute towards working to this ideal while being able to apply the skills learned in school,” Lu said in an interview with The Tartan. 
“It was quite nice to see a reminder of why I am incredibly grateful and happy to be a CMU design student,” Lu continued. “The competition experience involved everything I loved from reading up on the current energy climate to organizing the informational hierarchy to having fun playing with the nuances in the color theme - the process I feel really reflected the type of bigger picture designing and process emphasized curriculum CMU Design cultivates in students.”
“Winning this challenge made me proud to represent Carnegie Mellon Design,” Lai said in an interview with The Tartan. “It also encouraged me to create or join more design challenges, because participating in this one was a fun and rewarding journey.”
The top three teams received a cash prize of $2500 each. Since Lu, Lai, and Lee won the grand prize, they will also receive a trip to the Geothermal Resource Council’s 40th Annual Meeting on Oct. 23-26  in  Sacramento, California to present their infographic.

Those of you with too much time on your hands may have found yourself wondering from time to time: how does concrete work? We walk on it almost every day. It’s used for roads, walls, columns, and housing foundations, to name a few applications. But what is it made of?
A fellow by the name of Joseph Aspdin, an English cement manufacturer, patented the method for producing Portland cement, a major ingredient of concrete, in the year 1824. 
But the history of concrete isn’t as concrete as you might imagine, since its origins date as far back as ancient Egypt and Rome and materials similar to concrete can be found in the pyramids and the Pantheon.
Aspdin’s method has changed little since the 1820s and continues to be used regularly throughout the world. Concrete is, both metaphorically and literally, a key ingredient in the foundation of modern day building infrastructure, valued for its high strength and ability to be formed into almost any shape. In fact, over two billion tons of cement are produced each year!
Concrete is generated via a chemical hydration reaction between cement and water. It is important to note here that cement and concrete are not the same thing. Cement is composed of limestone and clay, which are heated together at 1450 degrees Celsius in order to induce a reaction generating calcium silicates:
CaCo3 + SiO2 → CaSiO3 + CO2
In this newly-reacted powder form, cement readily undergoes the previously mentioned hydration reaction that enables the creation of concrete. Concrete is a mixture of cement, water, sand, and small rock particles.
It works as follows:
Cement grains are dissolved in a mixture of water sand, and small rock particles, releasing calcium and silicon ions in the process. 
Once the ions spread throughout the mixture and reach a critical concentration in solution, they begin to precipitate out of solution and form a cement film around the small rock particles. A general ratio used by many companies is one part cement to three parts sand to three parts small rock particles.
This cycle of dissolution, diffusion, and precipitation continues for about an hour, causing the film to grow and the concrete to strengthen until the precipitated grains begin to impinge on one another and the entire mixture solidifies. 
It is at this point that the concrete begins to “set” and lose its fluid properties. Hydration of concrete is visually complete in only a few hours; however, on the microscopic level, hydration can continue to occur for months or even years.
As you can imagine, concrete is an extremely complicated material with a fairly disorganized atomic structure. Interestingly, although concrete is used nearly twice as much in construction than any other building material, the crystalline structure of concrete was only just revealed by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2009.
As we begin to understand concrete’s molecular make-up, we can make inroads into making concrete crack-resistant and more environmentally friendly. With these benefits, concrete will continue to be used to build roads, houses, and foundations. The future of concrete is bright!

If you own a smartphone, you’ve probably heard of the newest mobile game sweeping the nation — or at least kids ages five to 35, and then some.
Pokémon GO is a free, downloadable, international app developed by Niantic Inc. that utilizes augmented reality to populate a player’s surroundings with Pokémon characters from Nintendo’s popular games for users to catch.
Players interact directly with their smartphone screen using a Google Maps layout. They can level up by catching and evolving Pokémon, visiting Pokéstops, and training and competing in Gyms, to name a few.
One of the game’s selling points has been encouraging its mobile players to go outside and walk around, allowing them to take advantage of the nice summer weather. An entire section of Pokémon GO’s website is dedicated to exploring. It states, “Get on your feet and step outside to find and catch wild Pokémon. Explore cities and towns where you live — and even around the globe — to capture as many Pokémon as you can.  As you walk through the real world, your smartphone will vibrate to let you know you’re near a Pokémon.”
Pokéstops, for example, are another way that the game connects a virtual player to reality. They can be located at interesting or significant landmarks around a player’s area such as monuments, historical markers, or even a park bench in Schenley.
Pokémon GO is bringing this type of augmented reality interaction to a stage that some would argue hasn’t been approached on this scale before. With over 100 million downloads and millions of people playing the game at any one time, the game is bound to have real world consequences.
Jeffrey Bigham, associate professor of human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science, is excited to see where this exposure to augmented reality can take us. 
In a university press release, he said, “There’s so much more potential for augmented reality than what Pokémon GO shows. But I think it’s just the beginning, hopefully, of what we’ll see.”
Games that use augmented reality like Pokémon GO could be used in education, business, and more. 
“One area that I’m really interested in is how we can turn players of these sorts of games into sensors on the world,” Bigham said in the press release. “So that could help a lot of different people navigate the world more easily.”
Augmented reality can also enhance and amplify our own human capabilities. Although it sounds like something out of a science fiction movie, augmented reality could be used to help identify people in a room by displaying their name over their head. It could even overlay videos in real-world situations to explain how to perform a certain task. 
Drew Davidson, the director of the Entertainment Technology Center at Carnegie Mellon, is already receiving calls asking how to apply the game to education. In the university press release, Davidson attributes the appeal of the game to students as simply being “because kids like it, and they care.” 
In regards to its application to education, he questions, “How can you take these mechanics and this idea, even if it’s not Pokémon GO specifically, just to understand what’s making it work? How do you get them that inspired and that engaged?”
Augmented reality such as this is not without risk, though. Player safety has become a prevalent issue, with players chasing Pokémon through unsafe areas without taking into account reality’s surroundings. 
As a result, Pokémon GO’s website has become riddled with warnings like, “For safety’s sake, never play Pokémon GO when you’re on your bike, driving a car, riding a hoverboard, or anything else where you should be paying attention, and of course never wander away from your parents or your group to catch a Pokémon.”
In addition, since the game’s development, the company has received a number of lawsuits pertaining to homeowner comfort and safety. When developing the game, Niantic used user-submitted data from one of its other games — Ingress — to determine locations for Pokéstops and Gyms, and some of these locations didn’t translate well from the virtual world to reality.
Augmented reality will undoubtedly change the way we interact with the world around us. The question will be whether or not the benefits of using it outweigh dangers.

For one week during the month of October, Colors @ CMU, an organization that seeks to ignite conversations about racial issues on the Carnegie Mellon campus in an effort to bring together people of differing backgrounds, will be hosting its first ever 2-4-1k Grand Challenge. 
The 2-4-1k Grand Challenge will take place from Oct. 1 to Oct. 7. Teams, consisting of two recognized student organizations, one of which must be a multicultural organization, will be tasked with utilizing a monetary budget with the goal of collaboratively developing a project that will make a positive impact on the Carnegie Mellon community.  Teams are free to create any project they desire to ultimately satisfy two goals: The project must be community based, directly involve and increase interactions between Carnegie Mellon students, and it must show tangible results by the end of the week. 
The aim of the project is based on Colors @ CMU’s goal to bring together members of different student organizations whose paths would not normally cross. “While there are many amazing cultural organizations out there at CMU, you don't really see them interacting with each other,” said Chrystal Thomas, a senior biological sciences major and creator of the challenge. Colors @ CMU hopes this challenge will increase collaboration between multicultural organizations at Carnegie Mellon. “We would love to see students involved in OM (The Organization for Indian Spirituality and Culture) feeling comfortable and interested enough to collaborate with SPIRIT and vice versa, or to see SALSA (Spanish and Latin Student Organization) collaborate with ASA (Asian Students Association),” Thomas said. “While these groups seem [to] have different interests, I believe they are actually quite similar.” 
Thomas believes this challenge will help show various student organizations the aspects that they have in common, which can ultimately motivate these individuals to step outside of their comfort zones. This can allow the members of the organizations not only to connect over the things they have in common, but also to create a desire to gain new perspectives from students with different cultural or racial backgrounds from their own.   
While the first year of college is when many seek out their niche on campus, this often creates a level of comfort that, over time, makes it harder to break barriers that inhibit us from engaging with other campus communities. The 2-4-1k Grand Challenge seeks to affirm the notion that there is not a limited time when one can partake in self-discovery and that we should be open to reigniting the bright-eyed freshmen desire of meeting new and different people. 
“I think the idea of the 2-4-1K challenge is to give an opportunity to break that barrier and encourage interaction among different people,” Sharon Wu, junior chemistry major and Colors @ CMU e-board member, stated. “In that way, I hope that the challenge will embody what it truly means to be a diverse campus. Having diversity should not be some statistic that admission officers stick on paper, but rather something incoming students look forward to, as they will be able to learn new perspectives and, in turn, grow as people.”
Registration for the 2-4-1K Grand Challenge will be open from Sept. 10 to Sept. 24. There will be an information session on Sept. 10 at Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall, room 103 from noon to 1 p.m. The winning teams will be announced on Oct. 14. The first place winning team will receive a $1,000 cash prize, and second place winners will receive $400. There are no restrictions on these cash prizes, so each team can decide to use it as they please. 
Any questions about the challenge, such as a request to see an overview of the rules of the competition, may be sent to 241kchallenge@gmail.com. 
“We're really looking forward to seeing all of the great projects in October!” Thomas said.

A 22-year-old University of Pittsburgh student, identified as Grant Birdsong, who hails from the nearby Indiana Township, made waves on the internet last week when he attempted to leap from the rooftop of one building to another, but instead fell and got wedged between the two, all allegedly to impress a woman he just met. The two had gone up a fire escape to the rooftops of the Qdoba and Bruegger’s Bagels restaurants in Oakland when the incident occurred. The area, on Forbes Avenue near Atwood Street, is relatively central to the University of Pittsburgh, but is also often visited by Carnegie Mellon students looking for nearby off-campus food options.
At approximately 2 a.m. Tuesday morning, rescue workers arrived on the scene to try to retrieve the student from the 17-inch gap between the buildings. Police, firemen and paramedics all contributed to the effort for about four hours before Birdsong was finally freed at around 6 a.m. At one point, a paramedic rappelled down the gap, descending around three stories to help. Eventually, a jack hammer was used to break through the wall of Qdoba to successfully extract Birdsong.
The entire episode was live-tweeted by the Pittsburgh Public Safety Department, and was mentioned on several national news outlets. As Birdsong was wheeled away from the scene on a gurney, conscious but bleeding and sporting a broken ankle, he reportedly waved at TV news cameras.
A brief video of Birdsong after he was rescued shows him calmly laying on his back on a stretcher as he rolls towards an ambulance. He raises his arms in the air to give two thumbs up as he disappears into the vehicle.
On the internet, many who reported the story found humor in Birdsong’s ordeal. Time Magazine described it as “a harrowing tale of modern love, male ego, and parkour” and commended the Pittsburgh Public Safety Department’s dedication to live reporting the incident on Twitter.
Vice Magazine had a list of questions for Birdsong, starting with “Are you OK?”, followed by questions such as, “What was the conversation like on top of the roof? Did you immediately start bragging about your long-jumping ability, or did she start talking about her ex who was a really good jumper, or what exactly was the chain of events here?”, and finally ending with “Are you OK? I hope you are OK” again.
The roof-jumping incident even earned a mention in Jimmy Fallon’s monologue on The Tonight Show, as Fallon admitted he laughed when he heard the story, and joked that “Afterwards, the woman actually agreed to go out on a date…with the fireman who rescued that idiot.”
On social media, Birdsong was dubbed “Pitt Spiderman” and earned his very own hashtag.
Following the incident, the owner of the Qdoba, Chad Brooks, commented that his restaurant was likely to be closed for two weeks due to the new massive hole in its wall. However, Brooks stated that, “We were all young and dumb at some point, so no ill will toward him. I’m sure he’s embarrassed. I’m sure he’s hurting too.”
Bruegger’s Bagels was met with more fortune in the aftermath, experiencing a delay of only an hour before opening again at 7 a.m. on Tuesday morning.
Police considered filing charges, but according to public safety spokeswoman Emily Schaffer, the cost of the damage done was expected to be covered by the business’ insurance.
In the end, if it’s any consolation to Birdsong, the girl did end up staying through the whole ordeal to make sure he was okay. It is unknown, however, whether they kept in touch after that.

In light of the opening of the new fitness facility in the Cohon Center, the Carnegie Mellon University Department of Athletics, Physical Education, and Recreation recently announced that as of Monday, Aug. 29, Group X classes, endorsed by The Task Force on the CMU experience, will be free to all undergraduate and graduate students. This means that Carnegie Mellon University students can now partake in yoga, Pilates, Zumba, indoor cycling, and other Group X classes free of charge. Due to the added space of the new fitness facility, it was announced that the athletics department also plans to expand upcoming Group X schedules.
Group X classes were first inspired by the aerobics dance craze of the late 20th century, which was initiated by Kenneth H. Cooper, an exercise physiologist for the San Antonio Texas Air Force Hospital. According to the Group X page on Carnegie Mellon University’s athletics website, the first ever aerobics class at the Carnegie Mellon was called “Dance and Gymnastics,” with both activities being separated into the fall and spring semester. As the popularity of aerobics grew on campus, so did the demand for more classes and instructors.
“Over the years, the program grew and developed into Group Exercise, which is now called Group X,” the website states.
Making Group X classes free has been a work in progress for some time. Last year, the Athletics Department sponsored “Fitness February.” During this month, Group X classes were made free to undergraduate and graduate students. Additionally, a partnership between Athletics, Housing Services, and Student Life provided free Group X classes during the spring semester to residential students. The economic, physical, and ultimately educational benefits of these programs led to an increase in popularity and desire for free Group X classes year-round for students.
In the press release for the recently announced free Group X classes, Josh Centor, Director of Athletics at Carnegie Mellon, discusses the positive outcomes of these initiatives and what led to this decision. “We had great success with our initiatives last year,” said Centor. “I couldn’t be more excited that we are able to take this important step for our student community.” He hopes that the accessibility of these new classes will provide students the opportunity to be more healthy and active.
Group X classes used to be paid for through the Fitbucks payment system. Each Fitbuck would cost one dollar and a Group X class cost five Fitbucks. To pay for a Group X class, students were required to bring their Carnegie Mellon ID and tap their ID against a tablet to pay at the start of the session. This process still remains; however, students can now take advantage of the classes by simply arriving at their desired class a few minutes prior to it starting and presenting their student ID to the instructor. This is a much quicker, simpler, and more economically friendly alternative.
In the press release, Gina Casalegno, Vice president for Student Affairs, stated, “It is an exciting time to be at Carnegie Mellon with new investments being made in facilities and programs that support an enhanced CMU Experience.... I have been inspired to see the university’s commitment to holistic health and well-being come to life in our physical infrastructure through projects like the Cohon Center expansion and planned investments in the Tepper Quad and other building renovations. As we open the year with the impressive addition to the Cohon Center, I am thrilled the university is furthering the impact of our programs through the free Group X initiative for students.”
So far, reception to this news has been extremely positive among students.

Lately, many drivers have been making the switch from gasoline powered cars to electric cars. Why? The main driving factor leading many Americans to make this switch is the fact that electric cars provide benefits to today’s drivers that, for many, seem to outweigh the use of gasoline powered cars.
The major appeal of electric cars is the environment-friendly nature of the car, which swaps out the gasoline motor for an electric one, resulting in less pollution. This fact is especially great for those living in major cities where the effects of pollution from over-population pose an increasingly serious threat every day.
The appeal of electric cars has swayed many who no longer see the appeal of using gasoline and are starting to take notice of the negative aspects of it. Jason D’Antonio, director of the Health Profession program at the Mellon College of Science, commutes roughly 30 miles to and from work every day and has noticed that the fuel consumption from his current car has become too high for him. The gasoline free nature of electric cars is what appealed to him most. “I want to use little to no gasoline for commuting,” D’Antonio states. He also hopes that this aspect of electric cars will encourage others to make the switch as well.
The gasoline engine in regular cars is replaced with an electric motor in electric cars, which results in a nearly silent drive, another major appeal of electric cars to drivers. The electric motor is powered by controllers which get their energy from rechargeable batteries. While both types of cars look similar on the outside, one way of spotting the difference is to note that gasoline powered vehicles can be seen hooked up to gas pumps while electric cars get their energy from a charging wire.
Previously, Carnegie Mellon University was home to the “Electric Garage” which, in addition to eight vehicle recharging stations, also provided a high-power wall connector for Tesla electric cars. The high-power wall connector at the Electric Garage was able to provide roughly 58 miles of range per hour of charge. Located on 4621 Forbes Avenue, the Electric Garage was made free to the public in the Oakland area.
On Aug. 5, the Electric Garage was closed down to make room for the construction of the new Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Building. As a result, the electric car charging stations have been relocated to nine locations on the Carnegie Mellon campus. Two are located on the first level of the East Campus Garage, another two are located on the third level of the Dithridge Street Garage, and five are on the bottom level of the Robert Mehrabian Collaborative Innovation Center (CIC) Garage. As of Aug. 20, anybody using one of the three garages is able to use the charging stations.
While many people across the country have started to see the appeal of electric car use, the knowledge of this type of car, or rather the appeal of it, has not yet persuaded many in the Carnegie Mellon community, which may have added to the decision to utilize the old location of the Electric Garage for the new TCS building. In an email, Michelle Porter, director of Parking and Transportation Services at Carnegie Mellon, states “There is a very small number of students/[faculty]/staff utilizing the charges on campus.”
One could argue that while there are many real world incentives to using electric cars over gasoline cars, the lack of incentives for electric car use at Carnegie Mellon University, paired with drivers’ questions about the practicality and affordability of them, has not helped in promoting discussions about using this type of car.
Michelle Porter states that currently the university “[does] not provide any incentives for electric car drivers.” D’Antonio certainly believes this is a part of the problem. He points out that there are no financial benefits to using an e-car at Carnegie Mellon, such as, for example, a discount on parking electric cars. While there are no added incentives for using electric cars on campus, D’Antonio does note that one area electric cars do have an advantage is that while there are no gas stations around campus, electric cars are at least provided with a few charging stations for a couple hours of charge. This fact does not, however, make up for the lack of conversations about the usefulness of electric cars.
“As a university known for innovation and making ideas come to life, I would think that environmental awareness of this issue would be more front and center, and would permeate conversations resulting in more efforts to promote fuel efficiency commuting,” D’Antonio states.
While electric car use has not been given much attention on campus, there has been a lot more focus on other methods of transportation such as Zipcars, motorcycles, and handicap accessible cars, which have far more spots on campus that electric cars. The drive to include and promote conversations about other methods of transportation at Carnegie Mellon is present, but sadly electric car use has not been as included in this movement.
It is still unclear as to whether or not Carnegie Mellon University will take the initiative to promote more discussions around electric cars on campus. However, with the growing use of electric cars across the globe, one can hope that this will soon change.

This summer, the National Science Foundation (NSF) awarded a $1.1 million, four-year grant to a team of researchers in Carnegie Mellon’s Cylab to solve the problem of security in the Internet of Things (IoT).
The grant recipient is Vyas Sekar, assistant professor in electrical computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, who will work alongside professors Yuvraj Agarwal and Srinivasan Seshan from the School of Computer Science. The grant will primarily serve to pay the tuition and stipends of the faculty’s PhD students, whom Sekar deems “the absolute ‘lifeblood’ of the awesome research results you see here at CMU.”
The IoT describes the nearly six billion everyday devices that we use with network connectivity to send and receive information. It integrates the real and digital worlds and comprises the devices that we call “smart.” We use these devices in our houses, cars, natural environments, and even when choosing outfits, so, naturally, they run on an extremely wide variety of platforms.
Because of this diversity, the devices cannot be easily secured or regulated through software, like anti-virus programs. The best way to combat this problem is through the network.
In a press release, Sekar said that the team will operate under the assumption that the devices are broken and cannot be fixed, therefore the solution is to put a metaphorical “kevlar vest” around them to intercept any threats before they reach the device.
Despite its inherent brokenness, the IoT is worth the security. Sekar wrote in an email, “IoT promises to revolutionize various aspects of everyday life and many market segments — introducing new opportunities to improve the efficiency of various processes, cut energy costs, improve quality of life and so on.” But we interact with these devices so closely and so often that they tend to interact with our private information. A more secure IoT will allow users to feel more confident that their privacy will not be violated.
The NSF grant awarded to Sekar and Cylab signifies that this issue is worth the time, money, and research to the broader research community as well as to the average American. In order to be considered for a grant, researchers must submit a proposal to the NSF. The proposal is then sent through various phases of peer review. 
Panels of experts in the field evaluate all proposals to recommend which ones promise the most innovation and impact. Program managers then dole out grants to the top-rated researchers.
What makes Cylab’s  approach to security unique among Carnegie Mellon’s peer institutions is the breadth of specialties and departments that its faculty represent. Each team member brings something essential to the project. According to Sekar, security is “an inherently ‘cross cutting’ activity that entails several disciplines and a collaborative research attitude,” which Cylab’s faculty is built to handle.
On the collaboration with Agarwal and Seshan, Sekar said, “we bring together complementary expertise in different areas such as network security, software-defined networks, sensor networks, mobile systems, privacy, etc. that will be fundamentally necessary to address the IoT security and privacy research challenges.”

Jean Yang added to MIT Technology Review's "Innovators Under 35" List
Jean Yang, a new assistant professor joining the Carnegie Mellon Computer Science Department this fall, has been added to the annual “Innovators Under 35” list, an international list compiled by MIT Technology Review that recognizes 35 outstanding innovators across a wide range of fields. Yang was recognized in the Visionary category of the list for her work developing a programming model that integrates security into applications.
Previous winners who have been named to the list include Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder of Facebook; Jonathan Ive, the chief designer of Apple; and Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the co-founders of Google.
“Over the years, we’ve had success in choosing young innovators whose work has been profoundly influential on the direction of human affairs,” Jason Pontin, the magazine’s editor-in-chief and publisher, said. “We’re proud of our selections and the variety of achievements they celebrate, and we’re proud to add Jean Yang to this prestigious list.”
Yang received her Ph.D. in computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2015. At Carnegie Mellon, she will also have an affiliate appointment in the Computational Biology Department, having spent last year working on protein signaling models as a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard Medical School.

When you go to college it seems like every person you encounter has some trite piece of advice to offer you, like “these will be the best years of your life” or “make sure you get involved.” My favorite, though, is when people talk about “The College Experience.” What does that phrase even mean? It’s something frequently cited, and it is treated as this American Dream-esque goal that, once you find it, will grant you perfect happiness and fulfillment throughout your college years. An experience shared by students across America breeding stories to tell younger generations about “the best years of your life.” The whole concept of “The College Experience” is flawed from the start, beginning with the fact that there is not one singular way to achieve success and happiness in one’s college years. Every person finds his or her own way, a path that is different from every other student’s who has crossed a campus. There is also fault in calling one’s time in college “the best years of your life,” as if once college is over it’s all downhill from there. There will be some great moments in college and some terrible ones. Moments of complete bliss and of utter devastation, just like every other time in one’s life. To imply that college is a perfect four years of joy, is misleading and disappointing for every student who will find it to be otherwise.
For most students just starting at Carnegie Mellon, this is the first time that have been thrown together with students just as smart, just as motivated, and just as talented as they are. The students here are incredibly passionate about what they do and it easy to feel overwhelmed, overlooked, and left feeling like you some how are not “good enough” to be here. There is a lot of pressure on this campus to do more and to be more. People want to know what you will be doing in the future, how many units you are taking now, and how many activities you are involved in, and will tell you on the next breath how they are doing more.
The stress culture that exists at Carnegie Mellon is not something to be dismissed. Students will brag about how many units they are taking, how little sleep they get at night, and how their day is so packed they don’t even have time to eat, as if starving yourself and depriving yourself of sleep is a sure pathway to success. It is something that is so easy to get swept up in. It is easy to fall into the trap of overworking yourself when you are surrounded by people who are doing the same. You have to take care of yourself. You cannot succeed in anything if you do not first make time to make sure that you are healthy; mentally, physically, and emotionally. Don’t be afraid to admit to yourself that you may need to take a step back or that you need help.
It’s okay to feel lost and scared going off to college; it’s an enormous change in anyone’s life. You need to be true to yourself and take care of yourself. You cannot help yourself if you don’t know yourself. Allow yourself to be vulnerable, honest, and open to the world. It’s scary, especially because before coming to college most students have lived in this world they have known since childhood, surrounded by people who know one version of them, which may or may not be the truest version of themselves. It is terrifying to bear your soul and show the truest version of yourself to the world, but it is the only way for you to discover the person you really are.
After completing your freshman year, you will not have erased every remnant of yourself and be this new person who is unrecognizable from your former self in every way, yet it cannot be denied that college changes you. Those changes come through self discovery. They do not come from throwing away everything that has made you you up to this point, but from embracing the true version of yourself and allowing yourself to grow into that person.
Don’t be disillusioned into believing that there is some formula for how to go through college. There is some truth that exists in clichéd advice people will give you — after all, they are clichés for a reason — but in the end “The College Experience” is not some stock term that can be applied to any student; it is not a crazy fun time the whole way through, nor is it four years of homesickness and loneliness. 
College is simply a new chapter in your life that will have some good times and some bad. For most students it is their first time living alone, the opportunity to live as an independent adult. It is an adventure; be open to the journey.

In August of last year a team of researchers from New York, Argentina, and Brazil published a proof of concept paper concluding that machine learning techniques that analyzed people’s speech patterns helped predict the onset of psychosis. This idea has caught on with many other psychologists, including NeuroLex Diagnostics CEO Jim Schwoebel, who is using the idea to develop a tool to help diagnose schizophrenia.
A data-based approach is a necessary step in the future of psychology and psychiatry and can help the field respond to its patients’ needs more efficiently and efficiently.
All the way back in 2006, researchers from West Virginia University published a paper concluding that psychiatric diagnoses were not reliable, meaning that the same symptoms could turn up different diagnoses with different patients and doctors. They attributed the unreliability to the lack of standardization among psychiatrists and proposed a method of diagnostics. However, psychiatric care continues to be a highly individualized process with different doctors having different methods. If diagnoses mean different things to different doctors, then a patient never gets help because their symptoms mean one thing to their psychiatrist and another thing to a psychopharmacologist, making communication and collaboration between their care providers impossible. This disconnect prevents patients from receiving treatment, and makes the medical intervention a waste of time and money. These problems are compounded by the high price, both in time and money, of psychiatric care, and the fact that many doctors are overloaded with to many patients stuck in the endless cycle of failed diagnosis.
A lack of consistency is a problem machine learning is particularly useful for. Humans are excellent at discerning patterns where there are none through their own creativity and biases, so it’s easy for psychiatrists to get trapped in their own intuitions despite the evidence. Machines don’t have personal inclinations and basis, and won’t weight data in any particular direction. Machine learning could help organize the huge amount of information being thrown at a psychiatrist with each patient and would make headway into standardizing the process of diagnosis so treatment can be standardized and distributed well. Even if the final result is a machine learning algorithm just narrowing the field to several disorders, the algorithm could save hours of time for psychiatrists who might be overwhelmed with as many as fifty patients relying on them for care or weeks of the wrong treatment for a person that the psychiatrist’s intuition was wrong about.
Like any algorithmically based approach to anything, though, the idea of machine learning in psychiatric diagnostics is ruffling a few feathers.
The Atlantic feature on Schwoebel mentions two potential issues they have with his program. The first is that the artificial intelligence may not be able to pick up on cultural or personal differences. The second is a version of the first, saying that the findings of the algorithm will be biased towards particular demographic groups based on who is available for training the algorithm.
These problems could also be exacerbated because the stigma on mental health issues is stronger in some cultures than others. However, this is a reason that it might be difficult for a machine learning approach to be perfect, not a reason to abandon it. The algorithm has to be trained on as many people and as many segments of the population as it can. The process of picking up on a cultural speech pattern or accent is just using data — a person’s accent or vernacular compared to their overall speech pattern — to reach a conclusion about whether this person is or is not likely to have a certain mental disorder. That is exactly what data-based processes do.
While psychiatry as a whole needs to be modernized and take advantage of many new approaches beyond just this one, the reflex to apply machine learning and other data-based techniques is the right one. The early returns say speech patterns are useful in some cases and if proof-of-concept papers come out supporting many symptoms detected by this technology, it can be a really powerful tool even if it is outstripped by more specific tests. It requires continued interaction between psychiatrists and patients, so that information is recorded and remains cheap and easy to get. If it turns out to be a versatile tool that is useful in diagnosing many mental disorders, it can help narrow down the more specific tests someone might need or improve the accuracy of those tests by giving a doctor something more specific to look for.
People with mental health problems float through a vacuous network of aimless question and answer sessions that lead to guesses as to what might be causing their distress. These machine learning techniques can add structure and goals to that process and help get results for people who really need them.

Shishmaref, Alaska, is a village with a population of approximately 600, an Inupiat community on the small barrier island of Sarichef, north of the Bering Strait. The village is rather unassuming, with a single school, three main roads, a church, a post office, a few stores, and a collection of small houses. Yet this small, unassuming village is running out of space on their island, not because of human expansion, but instead because of the erosion of Sarichef island, erosion that is being attributed to climate change.
This is a problem that has plagued Shishmaref for decades — since 1969, more than 200 feet of shore has been eaten away from Sarichef island, according to a study published in February. Storm surges and flooding have caused loss of buildings and infrastructure, and officials have spent large amounts of time and money trying to save the island, totaling over $27 million dollars  on coastal protection measures from 2005-2009.
Last week, in the unofficial results of an election, the people of Shishmaref voted 89 to 78 to relocate their town, electing to move to one of two sites on the mainland. They join the list of aptly named “climate refugees,” people who are being forced to relocate their homes and lives due to rising sea levels and storm surges caused by global warming.
Rising sea levels and extreme weather patterns are two of the most visible examples of the effects that global warming has had on the environment. As global temperatures rise, polar ice caps begin to melt, adding water to the Earth’s oceans. Sea water also expands as it warms, further contributing to the rising sea levels. Furthermore, as the air warms, it is able to hold more moisture, leading to heavier rainfall events that lead to further flooding and more extreme storms. The effects of these changes can be seen worldwide, and it is predicted that by the year 2050, as many as 200 million people could be displaced due to climate change.
It is easy to look at environmental issues such as air pollution, water pollution, and deforestation and see the extent of the negative impact that humans have had on our environment. 
It is much harder to imagine our effect on something as massive as the oceans, or on something as seemingly permanent as the land. After all, we can watch slash and burn farming, we can see sewage be dumped into a water source, and we can understand a direct cause behind a very visible problem.
However, it is difficult to instill fear with a few extra inches of seawater. The rising sea levels are problems that are hard to witness before it is too late. 
It is often not until a major storm breaks, or until the flooding gets bad enough to make an area uninhabitable, that we realize a problem existed. However, there is evidence all around us. There is Isle de Jean Charles, a Louisiana island that was granted $48 million dollars in January to relocate its residents to safer ground after the island experienced flooding, saltwater intrusion, and shoreline erosion that has made the island uninhabitable. There is Shishmaresh, whose island home has been whittled down to an island a quarter of a mile wide and two miles long.
These problems are not some distant threat, they are staring us down in the face. They are problems that are making themselves visible more and more each year, accumulating years of chipping away at shorelines until it is seen in the disappearance of land, property, and community. Yes, today it might be an island in Alaska or an island in Louisiana with a population smaller than a suburban high school, but tomorrow it is the coast of Florida, it is New Orleans, it is the 
more than 1,000 American towns that are threatened by rising sea levels.
Luckily, for Shishmaref and for Isle de Jean Charles, relocation is an option especially suited for small populations. But what happens when the displacement doesn’t affect a few hundred people, but instead affects 200 million? Will we be able to handle it? It is time to take action now, to plan now, to look for solutions now, because if we wait for the problem to show itself, it will be much too late.

For the past 60 years, there has been a harsh disconnect between the fields of brain research and brain treatment, and it is a disconnect that deeply impacts the quality, access, culture, and efficacy of mental health care today. While we have a plethora of new treatment options for mental illnesses, the primary issue that creates a bottleneck in treatment is in the diagnosis and treatment planning procedures.
The current mainstream of mental health diagnosis relies on the DSM-5: the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders edition 5. The DSM-5 creates definitions of mental illnesses that lump together people that have vastly different root causes, manifestations, and treatment responses together under a single category and often leaves people that don’t fit enough core criteria of a single definition but are not mentally healthy out in the cold. This system is predominantly based on the external symptoms and traits a physician or patient notice during a visit. This is called a taxonomic classification. 
Unfortunately, this system is limited in its ability to actually describe what is going on beneath the surface, something that is crucial if we are to reach a point where we can have highly specific and effective treatments for mental illnesses, rather than putting patients into generic categories, prescribing treatments, and finding out if they work only by trial and error.
Compounded, these issues mean that receiving a diagnosis as defined by the DSM-5 does little to actually suggest a method of treatment for the issue other than an archaic system of trial-and-error that has long since been abandoned as the first line of defense in most other areas of medical science. 
For example, a symptom of anxiety can represent an endocrine disorder, a psychotic process, a drug response, or a currently recognized anxiety disorder, and each of these has a different treatment protocol, not including the variety of treatment protocols for the psychologically-based anxiety disorders. 
The result is that patients have to go through rounds of medical tests and screenings in a process of elimination that eventually dumps them in the category of anxiety disorder if no other explanation turns up. In this way, anxiety disorder turns into a catch-all for problems we don’t have medical tests for instead of a specific diagnosis with a clear treatment protocol like a patient would receive if they were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer or kidney disease.
What is necessary for the advancement of mental health care for the future is for the field of psychiatry to catch up to the advances in fields such as neuropsychology, molecular genetics, and neurobiochemistry. The present search for biomarkers, genetic predictors, or neuroimage markers for our existing system of mental illness categories is doomed to fail. These suffer at the same impasses as the rest of the DSM-5 diagnoses. With the overlap between different mental illness definitions and the extreme variety within each single definition, these DSM-5 categories are often not biologically discernible. What needs to change is how we classify mental illnesses. 
We need a system that classifies along a multidimensional matrix that accounts for all the ways a mental health disorders can manifest, from the genomic and molecular level to the way they take shape in emotions and social interactions. This is exactly what the Research Domain Criteria Initiative (RDoC) by the National Institute of Health is attempting to do.
Instead of viewing mental illnesses as collections of symptoms for a diagnostic label for ease of communication, the RDoC looks at the brain as a system of multiple different, interrelated but discernibly neural circuits that can be evaluated not only on self-reported or physician observed symptoms, like in our current system, but also described through variance in specific neuroimaging patterns, behavioral-cognitive tasks, and biomarker tests. The best part is that we have a substantial amount of data already available about these biomarkers and neuroimaging patterns; researchers have simply been trying to interpret them in the current taxonomic structure that invalidated these smaller subpopulations. 
Through this system, researchers hope to eventually reach a point where the health care provider does not simply issue a diagnosis of schizophrenia, but instead is able to locate which specific neurotransmitter and receptors are specifically malfunctioning and in which part of the brain, allowing them to issue a specifically tailored treatment for that patient’s condition. The RDoC will allow healthcare providers to see what is wrong in the patient’s brain, not simply how it manifests.
With this new matrix of different core elements, the primary diagnostic tool will be based on biomarkers, neuroimaging strategies, patient-reported data, cognitive-behavioral task, and observed behavior all taken into consideration. The differences along each of these domains will relate to a specifically discernibly neural circuit difference and treatment procedure. 
What will be required to improve treatment efficacy is a complete overhaul of the current system of classifying, diagnosing, and describing mental illnesses themselves. Until this revision occurs, mental health care will continue to misdiagnose illnesses and operate a non-targeted, trial-by-error method of treatment protocols, which in turn will jeopardize time, resources, and the well-being of patients all across the board.

The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has recently reversed its previous decision denying granted graduate students the right to unionize and giving them the rights of employees. 
Their decision comes in the wake of a petition filed at Columbia University. The ruling was 3-1 in favor of graduate students having the right to collective bargaining. With all the work that seems to be done by graduate students, it seems to be the obvious response to allow them to behave as actual employees, but for the NLRB this decision has been anything but simple. One of the main reasons for initially not giving graduate students the ability to unionize was the “primary purpose” or “primary relationship” ideology. First applied to Adelphi University in 1972, this is the idea that graduate students’ primary purpose on campus is to learn and that jobs such as teaching and working as a research assistant facilitate this. This decision was notably overturned in 2000 and then, in 2004, the NLRB returned back to the “primary purpose” justification.
The NLRB has maintained the idea that graduate students are not protected under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), only wavering from this opinion between 2000 and 2004. The NLRA is an act that protects the rights of employees to unionize, participate in collective bargaining, and go on strike. This act initially did not cover any employees of private universities, but this changed in 1970 when the NLRB decided that differentiating between commercial and noncommercial activity was not necessary. This is when the NLRB decided that private universities would be included in this jurisdiction. 
The distinction between what is being done by graduate students for educational purposes and what is being done for commercial purposes seems to often be what causes the NLRB to go back on its decisions.
While graduate students are on campus to learn, they end up being so much more than just students while they are on campus, with not all of their tasks being essential to their learning. As teaching assistants, they are often teaching introductory level material in their field. They’re left with the task of going into detail and further explaining the material in ways that the professor often does not have time to do in lecture. With lectures being so large, it is the time during recitations with teaching assistants that really makes the difference for most students. 
This experience can be useful for graduate students, but they are usually teaching information that they already have a pretty comprehensive knowledge of. The idea that they are furthering their education through this process does not really hold up well. They are teaching recitations for the benefit of undergraduate students, not necessarily for themselves.
In addition to playing a pivotal role in the education process for undergraduate students, graduate students also play an important role in the development of research at universities. While this is something that graduate students can benefit from educationally, it is also something the world can benefit from. So many ideas for products start as an idea between a graduate student and a professor in a research lab. For this, graduate students deserve to be able to protect their rights as employees. Graduate school is not easy to afford, and for all the work that they do in addition to their classes, they deserve to be able to negotiate their salaries.
The indecisiveness of the NLRB is not only giving everyone whiplash, but it’s also unfair to graduate students who are unable to negotiate their rights when these students play such an important role in undergraduate universities. Their rights are often ignored with much of the focus at many universities being placed on undergraduate students. Graduate students are the silent heroes that keep universities thriving. Even at schools like Carnegie Mellon that have roughly the same number of graduate and undergraduate students, they can be a separate entity that is often not heard by undergraduates outside of recitation. They deserve to have a collective voice, and that voice often gets drowned out amid the voices of professors and undergraduate students.
Graduate students have been treated as second-class citizens by the NLRB. They are students, but the work that they do whether it is for educational gain or financial incentives keep universities thriving and allow them to continue to receive grants to fund research. Research has shown that the ability to unionize will not harm faculty-student relationships, so there is no incentive for the NLRB to continually deny graduate students the same rights as other employees. This should be the NLRB’s last decision regarding the matter. It’s hard to believe that graduate students have only been given four years of the recognition that they deserve. Hopefully, this time, it will be a decision that sticks.
