Sixteen carries by team-leading running back junior Patrick Blanks weren’t enough to overcome six sacks and two interceptions on sophomore quarterback Rob Kalkstein, as the Carnegie Mellon football team fell 38–24 on Saturday to the Case Western Reserve University Spartans. The annual contest between the Tartans and the Spartans, known as the Academic Bowl, took place under sunny skies at Gesling Stadium.
Most of the game’s scoring occurred in the first and fourth quarters. In the first quarter, Carnegie Mellon got an early 7–0 lead on the first possession of the game, as senior fullback Chris Garcia capped a brisk five-play drive with a two-yard touchdown run. Then, the powerful Case Western Reserve offense took over, scoring three times in seven minutes to take a commanding 21–7 lead at the end of the quarter.
The Spartan defense stood up to its No. 10 national ranking. After the team’s first drive, Carnegie Mellon was limited to just two first downs for the rest of the half. Kalkstein was sacked five times and often seemed reluctant to throw the football.
“Their defensive line was the best we’ve seen all year, and in critical situations we had one or two mistakes that Case took advantage of. We couldn’t put a good drive together,” Kalkstein said.
The Tartan defense tightened up in the second quarter, limiting Case Western Reserve to a total of two all-purpose yards on four three-and-out drives. Tartan defensive linemen Vincent Brown, Andrew Medenbach, and Dallas Hartman teamed up for two sacks on Spartan quarterback Erik Olson. The scoreless second quarter sent both teams into the locker rooms with the score still at 21–7.
After forcing a Case Western Reserve punt, Carnegie Mellon put the first points on the board in the third quarter when first-year kicker Dylan Munoz nailed a field goal from 33 yards out. On the ensuing possession, the Spartans answered the Munoz field goal with a field goal of their own. Later, Olson completed a highlight-worthy 21-yard touchdown pass on fourth and seven to increase the Case Western Reserve advantage to 31–10.
Carnegie Mellon began to battle back in the game’s final quarter. Kalkstein completed five of five pass attempts in a 13-play, 70-yard drive that ended with a Jake Nardone touchdown reception. Senior Seth Napierowski replaced Kalkstein at quarterback and completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to sophomore wide out Eric Dissinger, bringing the Tartans’ scoring total to 24. It wasn’t enough, however: Case Western Reserve added some late-game insurance in the form of another touchdown, resulting in the contest’s final score of 38–24.
Kalkstein regained his passing confidence, throwing for a total of 136 yards by the end of the game. Blanks led the Tartans in rushing yards with 52, and Nardone’s four catches gave him the team’s top spot in receiving yards with 41.
“It was an emotional game and the team came out and played hard for four quarters,” Nardone said. “We all wanted to send [the seniors] off on a high note, but having three turnovers against a great team like Case makes it hard to win.” 
Saturday’s loss was particularly tough for Garcia and first-year offensive tackle Alexander Copeland, both of whom left the game early with injuries. Garcia, a senior, was playing in his final game as a Tartan. 
Garcia has had a remarkable career, having been named an All-UAA Second Team and Honorable Mention selection; he awaits another possible All-UAA selection for his play this season.
With the loss, the Carnegie Mellon Tartans end the 2011 season with an even record of 5–5. Case Western Reserve improved to 9–1, winning the Academic Bowl trophy for the fifth straight time and clinching this year’s University Athletic Association title as well.
“I am proud of the way the team prepared and performed,” Head Coach Rich Lackner said. “Naturally we are disappointed in a 5–5 record, but we have a strong nucleus of players returning and are optimistic about 2012.”

This week, we met up with senior mechanical engineering major and club baseball team captain, Bennet Poepping. The Tartans finished the fall season with the best record the franchise has ever recorded in a single season. 
“My proudest moment was helping our team to a 10–2 start this fall. We’ve had some of the best turnouts for games this year, and hopefully it continues into spring,” Poepping said.
Poepping has been playing baseball since he was five years old. “I’ve never not played baseball in the summer. I don’t know what I would do without it,” he said.
When Poepping came to Carnegie Mellon after playing at Sewickley Academy, he knew he still wanted to play, so he went to the interest meeting. “[Club baseball] is definitely my fondest memory of my college experience so far,” Poepping said.
In practices, you can often find Poepping discussing the team’s upcoming games with the coach, planning lineups and strategies with him. “I enjoy the guys and our coach, Claudio Reilsono. We just have a lot of fun playing the best sport in the world,” Poepping said.
He is the team’s captain, and has contributed a lot in his three and half years of Carnegie Mellon baseball. He is consistently one of the best hitters and pitchers on the team and has developed into the team’s ace. His goal for the next semester is “to continue pitching well and improve my running to better support our team as a complete player.”
The quality of his play on the field is corroborated by head coach Claudio Reilsono.
“As a player, it is a great feeling for me as a coach to know that, every time Bennet comes up, the odds are in our favor that he will come up with a big hit, a big game pitching, or a great defensive play,” Reilsono said.
Poepping’s skill on the field is equally matched with his leadership abilities. “His motivational skills have been perfected through the past four seasons he’s been here, and he knows how to connect to everyone on the team in a way that makes us want to succeed,” junior second baseman Joe Barbish said.
Poepping’s expectations for this Tartan baseball team are high. “I want to see us win a championship because our coach really deserves one. We are definitely capable,” Poepping said.
Poepping has fond memories of the club baseball team and its traditions. “On our way to Florida for spring break, we always make a stop at a Waffle House once on the way there, and once on the way back,” he said.
When the team travels to games, Poepping is the initiator of musical traditions. Like clockwork, he plays R. Kelly’s “Trapped in the Closet,” or the Space Jam soundtrack. He has made this the team’s way of getting pumped up and ready for games.
The funniest moment from Poepping’s career on the ball club is when a deer came onto the field. “It kept crashing itself into the outfield fence, apparently unable to discern that a fence will stop your momentum,” Poepping said.
Then a member of the team assisted the lost deer. “The benevolent Tom Walko grappled it by its neck and dragged it halfway across the field to the exit,” Poepping said.
In the end, the deer was okay.
Poepping’s time with the Tartans has been memorable. By the end of his career, he should hold many Carnegie Mellon baseball records, but it is his personality that will be most remembered. “As captain, Bennet is a valuable asset to the team and always manages to pull the team through tough game situations. He will be missed when he graduates after the spring season, but he is a definite future CMU hall-of-famer,” said junior utility player Pedro Cuacuas.

Nov. 7 marked the 20-year anniversary of one of the most pivotal days in sports and science history.
Twenty years ago, then-Lakers superstar point guard Magic Johnson held a press conference, one that was dynamically heartbreaking, frightening, and perplexing. Johnson ended his already hall-of-fame-worthy career much earlier than expected, announcing he had been diagnosed as HIV positive.
The press conference was a star-studded event to celebrate Johnson as the face of the campaign to find a cure for AIDS. Besides being one of the NBA’s all-time greats, transcending the game of basketball and orchestrating the high-octane Showtime Lakers offense, Magic Johnson and the Magic Johnson Foundation have been crucial in the fight against a disease that kills about 1.8 million people every year.
Johnson stood at the podium, commanding the audience, at one point drawing six members of the National Basketball Association Hall of Fame up to the podium with him. The sports world watched in awe, because 20 years ago, nobody though Johnson would be alive.
In 1991, HIV and AIDS were enigmas compared to what we know about them today. People accused Johnson of being bisexual or gay because that was the perceived demographic of AIDS. He admitted to having multiple sex partners, but the lack of knowledge about HIV caused people to question. His attempts to return to the game were futile due to players’ concerns about catching the virus simply from contact with Johnson.
But after 20 years of the Magic Johnson Foundation’s efforts, the world is more knowledgeable about the HIV and AIDS disease, and treatments of exponentially better quality have been produced.
While it was a celebration of what Johnson has contributed to the eradication of this disease, the event was a forum of admiration for a truly great man.
What he did on the basketball court is legendary. At 6'10", he played an innovative game at point guard. He is a five-time champion, three-time most valuable player, three-time NBA Finals most valuable player, and 12-time all-star. His creative passing and firm leadership were staples for great Lakers basketball in the ’80s.
As a rookie, Johnson’s Lakers faced Julius Erving and the Philadelphia 76ers in the NBA Finals. The Rookie of the Year winner, Johnson was asked in game six to start at center for the injured Hall-of-Famer Kareem Abdul Jabbar. Johnson overcame what most would consider a gaudy obstacle by scoring 42 points, grabbing 15 rebounds and adding seven assists.
His rivalry with the Boston Celtics Hall-of-Fame forward Larry Bird is one of the greatest in NBA history. It was the spark to a lot of Johnson doubters. After a disappointing loss to Boston in the 1984 NBA Finals, where Johnson botched a chance to win game one by not getting his shot off in time and turning the ball over late in game seven to lose the series, Johnson was a target for heavy criticism. He used the criticism as motivation and came back in 1985, led the Lakers to the Finals again, and beat the Celtics in six games.
Doubters of his “clutchness” were proven wrong in the 1987 NBA Finals, once again against the Celtics, where Johnson hit a baby hook shot over Robert Parish and Kevin McHale to win game four 107–106. The Lakers won that title in six games, and Johnson earned his third NBA Finals MVP.
But Johnson would have to overcome no obstacle greater than the HIV he would have to fight. His career was ended in its prime, and basketball fans were heartbroken and stunned. But who better to beat a disease than a man with the competitive fire it takes to be a legendary athlete?
Twenty years later, Johnson stands strong, still fighting for the cause. This press conference celebrated that fact, that he was a role model for a fan base that loved him and is now a national role model.
With all of the work the Magic Johnson Foundation has accomplished, we can expect that 20 years from now, we will be celebrating Johnson in a similar fashion. Defying odds, he will be up on that podium, commanding the room, inspiring so many.

Winding up a record-setting fall season last month, the Carnegie Mellon club baseball team is currently in the offseason and looking forward to the start of spring training in March. The Tartans finished the fall at 10–2, a franchise record, dominating the majority of their opponents.
“We had a great season, our best winning percentage ever,” said Head Coach Claudio Reilsono. “But to me it was not only a special season because of our record, but because of the type of people we have on the team.”
Due to the lack of a baseball field on Carnegie Mellon’s campus, the club team spends a lot of time traveling. On campus, the team uses the Skibo Gym arena room and the soccer field. Players also train at Stanton Heights Field, Bellevue Park, and the Baseball Training Academy (west of the city). The club has organized practices three times a week, with team weightlifting on off days. Games fall on the weekends, typically as doubleheaders on Saturdays and single games on Sundays.
“We had one of our best seasons, in part due to our great defense,” said junior utility player Pedro Cuacuas. “Our practices helped solidify our consistent defensive presence.”
The team is active both in the fall (September and October) and the spring (April and May). Conference records from the two seasons are combined to determine playoff seedings in May.
This fall was highlighted by some big wins against the Boyce campus of the Community College of Allegheny County (CCAC). The last day of the 2011 fall season, Oct. 16, featured a Carnegie Mellon vs. CCAC Boyce doubleheader, with the second game going to extra innings. With that game tied 4–4 after the regulation seven innings, the Tartans’ offense pounced on Boyce in the top of the eighth. Junior second baseman Joe Barbish provided the game-winning hit to give the Tartans the 5–4 lead, and doubles by juniors Adam Gruber and Wade Brogdon ran the score up to 9–4. Sophomore pitcher Brendan MacNabb recorded the complete game in the bottom of the inning, sealing the win for the Tartans.
Brogdon led the club in hitting, batting .552 on the season and stealing a team-leading 12 bases. Junior left fielder Kyle Woltersdorf was the team leader in RBIs with 14, and he tied first baseman Eric Bruner for the team lead in home runs.
MacNabb and senior captain Bennet Poepping led the pitching staff. Poepping won four games, posting a dominant 2.57 ERA. MacNabb’s 24 strikeouts and 28.1 innings pitched were a team best this past season.
The Tartans’ offseason ends during spring break, when the team will travel to Tampa, Fla., for its annual spring training tournament. This tradition is a meaningful one for the players, as it provides the players with an opportunity to bond and connect with one another.
“Spring break baseball is vital to the preparation for our spring season. The combination of beautiful weather and good competition gears up the team for our games in April and May,” catcher Evan Fisch said.
The Tartans hope that their unprecedented 10–2 fall season will bump them into the top 15 in the National Club Baseball Association (NCBA) Division II rankings, due to be released just before spring play is underway.
“We put a lot of work in and the season went the way we planned. However, we know we’ve got to work even harder with the tough conference schedule in the spring,” Barbish said.
That schedule will feature the mighty Penn State Nittany Lions, who have dominated the NCBA’s North Atlantic South Conference.
“We have offense, defense, pitching, and a bench, and we play with a ton of passion and heart,” Reilsono said. “Our goal is for the last series of the season against Penn State to be for all the marbles. Penn State has won the conference six years in a row. We are looking to change that.”

A recent research study conducted by the Brain and Mind Institute at the University of Western Ontario has determined that some patients previously thought to be in a vegetative state are actually aware and conscious. A group of patients with severe brain damage (diagnosed as “vegetative”) was asked to perform simple activities, such as imagining a closed fist and other movements of their hands and toes. When comparing the patients’ brain activity to that of a healthy control group, the researchers discovered that roughly 20 percent of the group exhibited similar brain activity to the healthy group subjects — yet they were effectively paralyzed in every other way, unable to respond or communicate through other means.
This breakthrough result arrives in the wake of similar studies since 2006, which have used functional MRI scanning technology to scan similar patients’ neural activity. However, fMRI technology is exceedingly expensive, and the prohibitive costs traditionally make it a difficult option for hospitals to implement. 
“What’s particularly exciting about the recent results is that they employed EEGs, which is a relatively inexpensive and widely available method for measuring brain activity,” said David Plaut, a professor of psychology and computer science at Carnegie Mellon, and a faculty member in Carnegie Mellon’s Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition. EEG (electroencephalography) machines are a much cheaper alternative that can be implemented on a widespread scale. This changeover could be an important innovation in determining whether many “vegetative” patients still have some level of consciousness.
However, there are still challenges ahead. “On the one hand, it’s remarkable that some patients in what was thought to be a vegetative state are actually aware enough to follow simple instructions,” Plaut said. “On the other hand, there’s a tremendous amount of work yet to be done to understand the level of cognition and consciousness that these patients are capable of, and the extent to which emerging methods for decoding brain activity might allow for richer communication.”
The impacts on communication and quality of life for these patients could, in fact, be very significant. Previously unable to speak, move, or blink, they may now be able to speak with loved ones and answer simple yes or no questions, such as whether they’re in pain. 
Health professionals will soon be able to use this technology to diagnose patients’ mental states, too; after being distanced from social interaction for so long, patients may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues. This new technology has a lot of room for growth especially as brain-computer interface technology continues to improve, and it could spell out drastic improvements for those affected by neural impairment in the future.

Government regulation can actually foster technological innovation rather than hamper it, claims a study published this year by a team of researchers from Carnegie Mellon and Wayne State University. The findings further question the role the government should play in the inner workings of the private sector.
“We’ve done a whole series of studies looking at how government regulation forces technological change,” said researcher David Hounshell, a professor in Carnegie Mellon’s department of social and decision sciences.  “A more conservative view is that government is not good at shaping technologies in any direct way, ... that the proper role of the government is to fund more basic research and to develop technologies that pertain to very explicitly stated functions of government — things like military technologies. [They] think that regulations are always a detriment.” Hounshell pointed to his team’s study to dissuade this popularly held view.
To conduct their study, the researchers focused primarily on the impact of what they called “performance-based technology-forcing” auto emissions policies from 1970 to the late 1990s. They gauged innovation in that area by the number of auto emissions patent applications successfully granted in a particular time period, while regulation was measured by the tolerance levels of government policies  toward harmful automobile air emissions.
The team discovered that after the Clean Air Act of 1970 was passed — which placed emission limits on both stationary industrial factories and mobile vehicles — the number of successful U.S. patents went up significantly for the next few years as companies were forced to adhere to the new standards. These numbers dropped to unimpressive levels between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s in what Hounshell claims was the general absence of significant air emissions regulation. 
However, the time period between the late 1980s and into the 1990s once again saw a large increase in patent counts as the U.S. government developed more policies toward reducing automotive air emissions and passed an amendment to the Clean Air Act, further tightening the already strict bottlenecks on tolerable air emissions levels for U.S. automobiles.
“The kind of analysis that we’ve done with respect to emissions control really indicates that companies do respond to stringent regulations,” Hounshell said. “They do turn out to innovate the technology and to achieve the kind of performance standards that wise regulation entails. If the government is prudent in selecting a performance standard … it can actually force companies to invest in research that otherwise they would not in the absence of regulation.”
The group’s findings also support what has come to be known as the Porter Hypothesis, an idea first postulated 20 years ago by Harvard-trained economist Michael Porter. It states that environmental regulations can foster innovation and commercial competitiveness. 
It remains to be confirmed whether the theorem holds for other forms of regulation, but Hounshell reports that he and his colleagues have observed similar patterns elsewhere, such as in the standards affecting automobile safety technologies. Realistically, the researchers’ discoveries are unlikely to convince everyone that government regulation — in the automotive sector or otherwise — is for the greater good. As Hounshell indicated, some conservatives and business owners today think negatively of any form of government influence in the free market. Still, others push for what they dub a “smarter” kind of regulation, one that improves the coherency and transparency of the current rules.
“America’s CEOs are calling for smarter regulation –—the kind that will bolster business growth,” said Andrew Liveris, chairman and CEO of The Dow Chemical Company, according to a news release from Business Roundtable. “Unfortunately, the current U.S. regulatory regime tends to be so complex and inconsistent that regulations often do the exact opposite. We can turn that tide by ensuring pending and new rules are clear, consistent, and wise for the long term.”

Despite huge technological advances in the past several decades, common alternatives to air travel are relatively slow. A trip that would take a few hours on a plane could take days (or be impossible) by car, bus, or engine-powered trains. Enter the maglev train.
The term maglev is derived from “magnetic levitation,” a powerful technology that can accelerate trains up to 361 mph. This is comparable to the average speed of a commercial airplane, which, according to Boeing, is 565 mph. To achieve such high speeds, most maglev trains utilize EMS, or electromagnetic suspension. 
EMS works on the basic principle that opposite magnetic poles attract while like poles repel. Inside the track is a long series of magnetized coils known as the guide way. An electromagnetism research exhibit at Northeastern University explains that these coils generate a large magnetic field of the same type as the magnets attached to the underside of the train. Since the track and the train have like magnetic poles, they repel, causing the train to actually levitate between one and 10 cm above the guiding coils. The maglev remains levitated for the duration of travel, meaning that the negative impact of friction is effectively zero. This allows the train to maintain its speed for larger distances with a relatively small energy output.
The lack of friction raises an important question: Without anything to push off against, how does the maglev train accelerate? The answer, once again, lies in the power of electromagnetism. The power supplied to the coils of the track alternates at a rapid pace, causing the portion of the track behind the train to have one magnetic polarization and the portion in front to have the opposite. Calculated precisely, this allows the track to magnetically yank the train from the front (since opposite forces attract) and push the train from behind (since like forces repel). This constant magnetic system of push and pull allows the train to achieve high speeds without an engine.
Currently in development, a Japanese alternative to the EMS maglev system uses EDS, or electro-dynamic suspension. While tracks in EMS require a constant source of energy to keep the magnetic field fluctuating, EDS tracks use super-cooled conductors, which allow for a magnetic field to exist even when the energy supply is shut off. 
Professor Eric Hellstrom of Florida State University’s Magnetic Field Laboratory demonstrated this process with a modified train set, showing that once a conducting material drops below the critical temperature of –294°F, it becomes a superconductor, allowing for levitation. While cooling the tracks saves energy and allows the train to levitate higher, it is much more expensive than the EMS method.
In terms of speed, energy efficiency, and maintenance, maglev trains far exceed the limits of other types of land travel. As researchers around the world improve the technologies of trains, costs, —which are currently around $45 million per mile of track — will reduce as well. A group known as American Maglev Technology (AMT) has developed a “smart vehicle” that requires only $20 million per mile — a significant improvement from conventional models. 
Thanks to that oft-repeated principle of “opposites attract,” we may soon see the day when maglev replaces cars, buses, and conventional trains as the most efficient form of transport on land.

Conference will vote on abolishing the leap second
The leap second, a single second added to most years to keep UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) in step with the planet’s fairly complicated orbit time, may soon be abolished. A World Radiocommunication Conference held in Geneva, Switzerland, will vote in January on whether or not to pull our clock out of sync with the sun’s location.
Many countries prefer to keep the leap second, some for philosophical reasons, others because they believe there are some risks involved. Some believe abolishing the leap second inconsistently among countries may cause certain satellite network systems to fail long enough for there to be an air disaster.

Squid and octopuses can switch camouflage
Scientists at Duke University recently discovered that some squid and octopuses can switch between two different types of camouflage, depending on which predators are nearby. 
In the deepest parts of the ocean, some animals have evolved to be transparent to avoid being seen by light; other creatures have evolved to be red or black. A bulbous short-armed octopus and a squid can switch rapidly between the two states. The researchers simulated light generated by predators using blue-filtered LED lights; they found that the two creatures turned red under light and switched to their transparent state when the light was off.

Asteroid hurtles past, allows rare study opportunity
A 1,300-foot-wide asteroid came within roughly 201,000 miles of Earth on Nov. 8, giving scientists their closest look at the asteroid yet. NASA’s powerful radar was able to capture images that were compiled into a video of the asteroid as it approached. 
Scientists were also able to collect information about its speed, trajectory, and physical appearance, which helped them to predict its course for the next 64 years. Asteroids so close to Earth provide scientists with important clues into how the rocks escape the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars. The asteroid will travel past Earth again in 2075.

Study explains sickle-cell malaria resistance
A group of German scientists has discovered why carriers of the sickle-cell anemia gene are protected from malaria. 
Researchers compared two types of malaria-infected cells: “normal” red blood cells and red blood cells containing the mutated “S” gene that causes sickle-cell anemia. The researchers found that the sickle cells would collapse before the parasite was able to remodel itself inside the blood cell, stopping the spread of the disease. Being a sickle cell carrier is important for survival in parts of the world where malaria is endemic. Indeed, some studies have found that up to 40 percent of people in Africa are carriers for the sickle-cell gene.

DNA suggests mammoth species interbred
What scientists previously thought were two separate species of North American mammoths may actually be one species. The two species — woolly and Columbian mammoths — may have interbred, and some researchers say they should be regarded as the same species.
The new discovery comes after woolly genes were found in two preserved Columbian mammoths. The researchers, however, indicate that these findings need more verification. The DNA they compared was found in the mammoths’ mitochondria — the researchers plan to extract some from their cell nuclei next.

New diet drug shows promise in obese monkeys
A new drug has helped obese monkeys lose weight. The drug, which targets blood vessels that feed fatty tissue, was tested by researchers at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Known as adipotide, the drug seeks particular blood vessels that fatty tissues need and causes the cells found in those vessels to die. 
The 10 monkeys given adipotide lost an average of 11 percent of body weight over a month. The drug did not show many side effects, and it has been shown to work in five different species. The research team plans to eventually test the drug in overweight men with prostate cancer.

Carnegie Mellon was struck by indie rock talent this past weekend as it played host to local band 1,2,3 and the Canadian band Tokyo Police Club. The well-publicized event was presented by AB Concerts, which began planning this event in August. The head event coordinators were Lynn Streja, senior human-computer interaction and information systems double major, and Luyba Zeylikman, senior economics and psychology double major.
Walking into Wiegand Gym gave the impression that the audience was in store for an impressive show, thanks to the striking stage constructed in the center of the gym. The professional setup enforced the feeling that the audience was in for a great show, a feeling that was undoubtedly justified by the night’s end. The smoke-filled gym and the light effects also helped build anticipation for the concert to come. There was a large screen set up by cmuTV, which served as a great way for the audience to see several perspectives of each band.
Despite the setup, not everyone was pleased with the venue. First-year electrical and computer engineering major David Lu said after the show, “The performers were good but the venue was not that good, ’cause the gym resonated.... So there were a lot of notes with the first group that weren’t heard too well.”
The local Pittsburgh band 1,2,3 opened for Tokyo Police Club. In an interview, Zeylikman said, “We went through a lot of choices for [opening] acts. We chose 1,2,3 because we feel like they are about to hit it big, so we wanted them here before they do. We also like to support local bands.” Streja added, “It was a lot of hard work, but worth it.”
1,2,3 did a great job as an opener. Lead singer Nic Snyder has a unique voice with a broad range that covers everything from a falsetto high to a raspier low. The band has a very indie feel, which had audience members bobbing their heads up and down and swaying from side to side.
As the band played its last song, each member moved off the stage one by one, leaving Snyder behind for a mini solo performance. “I thought [1,2,3’s performance] was pretty good. I liked how they all got off stage,” said sophomore biology major Luke Diorio-Toth.
“It was a little mellow, and they could have gotten the crowd going a bit more, but it was still good,” said Dixie Kee, a junior computer science major, after the band’s set. “Lots of falsetto. Lots of cardigans.”
After a brief intermission, Streja and Zeylikman introduced the headliner, Tokyo Police Club. Its set definitely had more danceable music, filling the gym with energy. While the band members focused on their instruments, they were also always conscious of interacting with the audience, frequently instructing the crowd to clap and sing out loud at times.
The lighting of the show was spectacular — the band’s lead vocalist and bassist, David Monks, even gave a shout-out to the amazing display of lights.
“They are really great! Too many bands lack energy. It is always great to see the performers have more energy than the crowd,” said senior mechanical engineering major Chris Simundson, who spent the entirety of Tokyo Police Club’s set dancing away.
Others who were less familiar with the band seemed pleased nonetheless. Samuel Nalbone, a junior mechanical engineering major, said, “They were pretty good. I had never heard of them, but they were really great.”
A small group of attendees danced throughout the show, while others made several entertaining but failed attempts at crowd surfing (no one was hurt, though). Not everyone was paying attention to the music, though — in the back of the gym, some people sat on the floor in small circles talking throughout the concert, while next to the merchandise tables, there were global medical brigades selling cookies and other baked goods. Although the gymnasium was only about half-full throughout the concert, the audience — which included plenty of University of Pittsburgh students and sleeping baggers, in addition to Carnegie Mellon students — seemed to have a great time.

Students walking through the fifth floor of the Gates Hillman Complex or hanging out in the Zebra Lounge might have noticed a few new colorful additions to their walls. Student art is now being displayed prominently in both spaces, thanks to the efforts of a few sophomore art students and their new initiative, called ArtHang.
ArtHang began last semester, when “a group of us in the sophomore class in the art school felt discontented about how much student work we were seeing around campus, and we really wanted to see more,” Caroline Record, a sophomore art major, said. “We thought it would be a valuable thing for the artists and also for the community.”
While there is already student art on display at The Frame (a student-run art gallery on the corner of Forbes and Margaret Morrison), sophomore art major Claire Gustavson explained, “What we were interested in was bringing art to the places where students already were on campus and ... integrating art into the public spaces.... The Frame is definitely a great resource, but we think that ArtHang is performing a separate function.”
Even though the project was first conceived last semester, the students did not initiate their plan of hanging art around campus until this semester. Currently, ArtHang has an exhibit in Zebra Lounge called Zebra: Twelve, and, in a different exhibit, is using a projector at the top of the Helix in the Gates Center to display nine different video works. “Gates is a great venue for exploring ArtHang projection and media because it’s in a place where there’s primarily not art majors, so then you’ve got the [computer science] majors that are viewing the art that might not otherwise see any art projects,” Michael Bennett, a sophomore art major, said.
Despite how new the project is, plenty of people have already become involved — about 15 students have participated in ArtHang through administrative, curatorial, and installation work. Although they each had some minor experience with installation before beginning ArtHang, “for the most part, this is definitely our biggest [installation] project,” Bennett said. “We want to teach ourselves and teach the people coming [to participate] how to properly install works, so we want it to be an educational thing, as well,” Record added.
ArtHang has also been getting plenty of submissions — so far, the project has received over 58 artworks for the Zebra Lounge show alone. Although most of the submissions have been from art students, the organization hopes to display more works by non-art majors. The projector in Gates in particular could “be a way in for non-art students who make different kinds of video work,” Record said. “We’re collaborating with Film Club to get some of their shorter silent works that they do.”
ArtHang already has plenty of plans for the future, the first of which is “trying to become a student organization,” Bennett said. Aside from this more administrative goal, the students hope to expand the number of spaces around campus where they can exhibit work. “We’re starting with things like eating spaces and dorm spaces and then as we get more credibility, more experience, [we’ll be] trying to push into places more like the UC and some academic buildings, where it is harder to get permission,” Gustavson said. Once they are more established, the group hopes to do an art show exclusively for non-art majors on campus, and eventually organize an art show off-campus for Carnegie Mellon art majors.
“We have so many dreams and so many plans,” Record said.
Students interested in submitting work to ArtHang can submit their artwork online at www.cargocollective.com/arthang. The deadline for ArtHang's next exhibit is Nov. 23.

Ines Pujos and Marci Calabretta first dreamt up Print Oriented Bastards — a literary journal for graduate and undergraduate students across the country — a year ago, as they were doing homework together. This year, their dream has become a reality, as they released the first issue of Print Oriented Bastards last Friday in the Gladys Schmitt Creative Writing Center.
Pujos, a senior creative writing student, and Calabretta, a 2011 alumna who majored in English and creative writing, received the 2011 Charles C. Dawe Memorial Award to help fund the literary journal, which has the tagline of “Every Writer’s Little Black Book.” In a literal sense, the journal fits this tagline perfectly: Its slim, compact shape is slightly smaller than the length of one’s hand, and it has a simple black cover.
The journal is also on its way to fitting the moniker of “little black book” figuratively. Although most of the contributors to the journal are, unsurprisingly, Carnegie Mellon students and alumni, the issue also includes writers from Knox College and Columbia College Chicago. The editors hope to increase the diversity of the journal’s contributors, though; at the release party on Friday, Pujos said that they are “sending this [issue] to all the graduate schools and undergraduate schools across America ... to promote young artists and writers.”
Print Oriented Bastards’ ambitions of becoming a reference point for writers is best realized in its diversity of content. Poetry, fiction, art, prose poetry, and photography are all represented, with subject matter ranging from hickeys to physics to softball games. The journal shines most in its poetry section; among the most successful poems is fifth-year creative writing major Andre Price’s “To My Landlord,” in which he combines a dilapidated house with beautiful images of nature. Senior creative writing major Caroline Kessler uses a conversation about congregating stinkbugs to explore her relationship with her brother in “An Evening with My Brother.”
Although the poetry section is the largest and strongest, the prose section also has several gems — “Lights,” by Francesca Thompson, a fiction writing major at Columbia College Chicago, provides an intimate and lyrical look into how tragedy can affect a small, tight-knit community.
The weakest point in the journal is the visual art. While “Ninfa” by Mariluz Orbay-Cerrato, a graduate student in the English department, is stunning, the other images aren’t as arresting. This is probably partly due to the journal’s small size: It’s difficult to fully appreciate an image when it’s only four inches tall. If the editors of Print Oriented Bastards want to continue to put the “little” in “little black book,” perhaps they should consider limiting the content to the literary, rather than the visual, arts.
Overall, though, Print Oriented Bastards’ first issue is well on its way to accomplishing its goals. Many a writer will enjoy slipping this journal out of his or her bag to thumb through for inspiration. Those interested in picking up a copy of Print Oriented Bastards can find them in the Gladys Schmitt Creative Writing Center in Baker Hall.

Tucked away from view on residential Sampsonia Way in the Mexican War Streets neighborhood of Pittsburgh, the Mattress Factory hardly seems like an artistic gem at first glance. But on the inside, the museum is a sanctuary of contemporary installation art — “art you can get into,” as the museum literature says.
It is important to note that the Mattress Factory is no ordinary art museum. The most fascinating part of visiting the Mattress Factory is the way in which the works of art incorporate the physical space surrounding them: walls, windows, ceilings, and floors. In this way, the art literally surrounds viewers and seeps into their environment. Ultimately, the museum has proven that art does not have to be confined to a gilded frame on a wall, testing its viewers’ understanding of the physical limitations of art.
The Factory Installed exhibit is no exception to this motif of environmental art. All of the works are site-specific; each artist hand-picked an area of the museum for his or her installation. Veronica Ryan’s “The Weather Inside,” for instance, features literal cutouts from the factory’s walls displayed throughout the room, and Pablo Valbuena’s “Para-Site [mattress factory]” creates optical illusions by projecting black-and-white patterns onto a pair of factory windows.
Despite the physical scale of the installations, however, some of the pieces seemed bland or hard to grasp. Ryan’s composition, though it spans the entire room, features relatively small pieces and a white and gray color palette. Though this certainly creates an ambiance of its own, the piece seems reluctant to take up the space it is given and does not appear to embody the description of “powerful experiences” which the museum has assigned to the exhibit.
Other pieces in the exhibit also seem either too lofty or too simplistic for some viewers to understand. Nika Kupyrova’s “Roadkill” consists of a few unidentifiable objects laid out across a white tiled floor. The white-and-pastel color palette creates an interesting aesthetic, but the strange objects lining the floor and the incongruous title of the work leaves some viewers confused. Likewise, Mariana Manhaes’s “Thesethose,” in which wired machinery connected to large inflating and deflating plastic bags create strange whirring and breathing noises, also may puzzle viewers with its odd array of objects and sounds.
On the other hand, several pieces in the exhibit offers powerful messages and captivating perspectives. Than Htay Maung’s “My Offering” portrays the hungry hands of victims of the 2008 cyclone in Burma; dozens of plaster hands holding bread lined the walls in a powerful appeal for donations. Also fascinating, though for a very different reason, is Valbuena’s light-projection piece, which creates black-and-white illusions using the structure of the museum windows — a somewhat eerie yet entrancing visual experience.
Despite minor drawbacks, the Factory Installed exhibit — and the entire museum, for that matter — is a captivating and thought-provoking atmosphere that can only be done justice by personal experience. The contemporary art at the Mattress Factory succeeds not only in challenging viewers’ perceptions of reality, but also their perceptions of art as a medium to express that reality. The Mattress Factory is an excellent place for those who want to expand their artistic palates and be exposed to new and interesting forms.

The Regent Square Theatre offers a musty, old Hollywood feel in its crumbling walls and red-velvet aura. On Wednesday night, the small building’s lobby was crammed with a mix of a young grungy crowd and what looked like the older version of these 20-somethings, complete with blazers and scraggly beards. This was the Steeltown Entertainment Project’s Film Factory Showcase, part of the Three Rivers Film Festival. It was packed with attendees either already in the film industry or just beginning to claw their way in. This was a night to celebrate the burgeoning talent of the blooming film industry of Pittsburgh.
According to the brochure handed to people upon entering, the Steeltown Entertainment Project offers opportunities to entertainment professionals in order to build a more sustainable film and media industry in the Pittsburgh region. The host of the night, Carl Kurlander, a professor at Pittsburgh Filmmakers and writer and producer of shows including Saved By the Bell, raved about the talent of this town through anecdotal stories. In reference to the accelerating growth of the industry, he thanked the audience for “being part of the monster, because it really has become a movement.”
This movement is fed by the incubation of projects like the Steeltown Film Factory, which awards winners with $30,000 to produce their short film. In 2010 Yulin Kuang, a senior creative writing major and film and media studies minor, was a top three finalist. Her screenplay, First Kiss, tells the story of a 14-year-old romantic named Adam Schoenberger searching for his first kiss. The film will be shot in Pittsburgh this December and is an “unabashed ode to the agonies of adolescence.” The production is made possible with the bountiful help and resources provided by Carnegie Mellon’s Filmmaking Club, in which Kuang is an executive officer.
Although First Kiss was not chosen to receive funding from the Film Factory, Kuang will be producing it for her senior thesis and is now fundraising through a crowd-funded platform called Kickstarter, where donors can support online. In order to successfully shoot her film, she hopes to raise $6,000 by Nov. 26. She noted Kickstarter’s fickle success rate, though, saying, “I’ve seen a lot of great projects get funded, and a lot of great projects not get funded.” Kuang created a short trailer for First Kiss, which can be viewed online at kickstarter.com. The warm and colorful aesthetic of this short preview alone alludes to the tickled feeling that the film will surely provide. The trailer was shown during the Film Factory Showcase before the work of last year’s winner premiered.
Christopher Dimond, a Carnegie Mellon graduate with a master’s degree in dramatic writing, won the 2010 competition with his film, Flour Baby, which tells the story of a Catholic school girl who faces the typical childcare assignment of a flour baby in a not-so-typical situation. Directed by Carnegie Mellon faculty member Melissa Martin, the short film features juniors Grace Rao and Gina Le Vine, students in the School of Drama. While the writing was remarkable, the execution of this film just did not seem to follow suit. The cinematography was strangely disjointed, featuring quick paneling of the camera and confusing cuts between characters. The film had amazing potential, yet it seemed to fall short of its high expectations.
Other notable speakers were Lauren Elmer, a graduate of the University of Pittsburgh with a B.A. in film studies, and Chris Preska, a Pittsburgh native. Elmer is manager of post productions for Sony Pictures Classic, and showed a beautifully shot and endearing short film called Smile about a girl who is in love with her orthodontist. Elmer’s own aesthetic seemed to match that of her film: Short, curly haired, and adorned in a baby doll velvet dress, she commanded the attention of the room with an unexpected but pleasant air of experience. She advised the audience of hopeful filmmakers to work with other writers in order to develop their ideas and begin building a team. This idea of building a network is what the Steeltown Entertainment Project hopes to implement here in Pittsburgh.
The following speaker, Chris Preska, created the award-winning sci-fi series The Mercury Men, which can be found on Hulu or on OnDemand. Preska developed the web series on an extremely tight budget of $7,000 for a total of 10 episodes. He showed the first episode, a thrilling black and white piece featuring pounding beats and suspenseful moments reminiscent of The Twilight Zone. Preska shared the phrase he continuously used on set: “limitation breeds creativity.” He set high expectations for the series and claimed that he was just stupid enough, and just ambitious enough, to do it. “There was no one to tell me I couldn’t … including myself.”
He shared that he has a poster of an Alex Ross painting depicting Super Grover from Sesame Street in his office, and paralleled his own blind ambition to that of Grover. “I love it because in my mind, that’s what Super Grover sees,” he said. “It’s a symbol that you can be greater than your circumstances might typically allow.” The second season of The Mercury Men is currently being developed, now with a significantly higher budget.
Pittsburgh may be referred to as an underdog city in the world of filmmaking, but even so, opportunities abound. Pittsburgh is breaking its way into the industry, as best evidenced by the filming of The Dark Knight Rises here this past summer. Students are encouraged to keep their eyes open.

The second of three creative writing student readings for the fall semester was a delicious showcase of the range of talents that Carnegie Mellon offers. It was held in Baker Hall 260, affectionately known as “the Glad.”
The theme for the night was “Masquerade Ball.” Even though a theme is usually attempted at these readings as a way of stirring up excitement, there was nothing in the way of decor that indicated the night’s theme.
Hosting the student reading in the Glad had its pros and cons. Although it does serve as an academic home to creative writing students and has a cozy, coffee-shop feel to it, the space is tiny. It is extremely awkward for audience members to maneuver their way around the room to pick up a slice of pizza, especially considering how packed the space was with eager audience members.
“I am really interested in what the upperclassmen have to say,” said Ivy Krislov, a sophomore creative writing and technical writing double major, before the event.
The night featured four readers: Noelle Crochet, a senior creative writing and English double major with a minor in film studies; Brian Sherwin, a senior creative writing major; junior Carolyn Supinka, a BHA student in creative writing and art; and fifth-year creative writing major Andre Price. All readers had unique and interesting pieces; for instance, Crochet read a loosely-structured ghazal, a Persian poetic form that uses rhyming couplets with a refrain in which each line shares the same meter.
Sherwin had the most unusual pieces. One piece that stood out most from the entire night was a piece which he prefaced by saying it was “not a poem.” It was indeed anything but. He proceeded for about three or four minutes to spew out phrase after nonsensical phrase. He read phrases that sounded like, “I are the the the that my horse can’t my a are your.” It made the audience feel as though they had stepped into the mind of a schizophrenic. Although the purpose behind the piece was nebulous, it was great to listen to such creative cacophony. Maybe its purpose was to have the audience contemplate its purpose.
Supinka, like Sherwin, had very interesting poems with meanings that were a bit hard to decipher. Nonetheless, the poems were engaging, especially her poem inspired by Leonardo da Vinci’s “Vitruvian Man.” She blended mathematical concepts beautifully with poetic visualization.
Like Supinka, Price had works that incorporated numbers, including one that described a highly specific procedure for drinking coffee. He turned it into an art.
After the reading, Crochet said in an interview that the event was “exhilarating. I am not the most comfortable with public speaking, but it is great to share my work in such a welcoming environment.”
Krislov said that she “will definitely come out to one [student reading] in the future. It was really cool.”
The next and last creative writing student reading for the fall is on Dec. 1 in the Glad. Come out to support the showcasing of talented Carnegie Mellon English department students.

Maybe the epic sound of her debut album Lungs is the reason why Florence Welch of Florence + The Machine has been repeatedly depicted as larger than life. Everyone reports the same thing — she dances on stage with no shoes, decorates rooms with found bird cages, and once made an art project that spelled out “You’re a twat” in artificial flowers. Even her success story has a bit of magic to it: Her now-manager found her in the bathroom of a pub, singing Etta James.
Ceremonials, her recently-released album, follows up on this sense of wonder, but does nothing to explore the other sides of Welch that are so interesting. While Lungs is a multifaceted book full of beautifully written short stories, Ceremonials is a complete novel — one that drags on for too long.
Ceremonials expands the otherworldly gospel sounds that Welch first created in tracks like “Hurricane Drunk” and “Cosmic Love.” Sometimes, this effort is surprisingly successful. Her first single, “Shake it Out,” is a more resolved, stronger version of the feel-good anthem “Dog Days are Over.” The song seems much more sure of itself — instead of the delicate, atmospheric harp in “Dog Days,” Florence concentrates on the percussion and highlights her soaring voice. You can almost see Welch dancing barefoot on stage as she sings: “It’s hard to dance with the devil on your back / so shake it off.”
Other notable tracks include “No Light, No Light,” in which Welch drops the memorable line, “You are the silence in between / What I thought and what I said,” and “Only if for a Night,” which has a haunting melody similar to that in “Howl.”
As a whole, though, Ceremonials falls flat. There is no follow-through on the angry, punk-influenced tracks scattered throughout Lungs in songs like “Kiss with a Fist.” The blues influence from tracks like “Girl with one Eye,” is also absent from Ceremonials. The songs that replace these sounds seem forced. These tracks try to create breaks between the many over-the-top, gospel songs with others that take a gothic direction. Welch sings about real devils, witches, and ghosts in a soft, spooky voice, rather than belt out lines about her personal demons. The subdued witch-pop song “What the Water Gave Me” comes a little too close to sounding like “Bat For Lashes,” while “Seven Devils” takes “spooky” a little too literally: The accompanying piano repeats a melody that sounds like it’s straight out of a Hitchcock film.
Hopefully this record is merely an impressive sophomore slump in Welch’s career. Until the next album, though, blast “Shake it Out” and let Florence + The Machine shake all the devils off your back for a dance-like-no-one-is-watching five minutes. And don’t forget to take off your shoes.

Dear Patrick,
I just turned 21, and now I’m ready to celebrate! I’ll be having my first alcoholic drink (after all, it’s illegal before you’re 21), and I was hoping you could offer some tips.
Thanks,
Busy Imbibing Rich Toxins, Happily Drinking Alcohol, Yearning for Bourbon Or Yorsh
Dear BIRTHDAY BOY,
Congratulations on surviving for 21 years! Now you can finally have your first (legal) drink. Here’s the deal — you better not pay for a drink tonight. Tonight, you — regardless of your gender — are the hot chick at the bar. Everyone else should buy you drinks. The bartender will give you at least one drink for free, and after that just walk up to any group and yell “IT’S MY 21ST BIRTHDAY!” 
Now, the key here is not to drink too much. Everyone’s going to tell you to take 21 shots, but they’re idiots. If you check your mail, you’re going to find a letter from University Health Services telling you not to drink alone. Yes — at Carnegie Mellon, the administration has to tell you to spend time with friends. Go with some friends that you know won’t drink too much, and will take care of you when you inevitably black out. Don’t bring those guys who would take that opportunity to pull out a Sharpie and go to town.
Just take a few aspirin before passing out,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I suspect there may be more to life than being really, really, really, ridiculously good-looking. Can you help me find out what that is?
Thanks,
Beautiful-Looking Übermensch, Empty, Seeking True Enlightenment, Eschews Lefts
Dear BLUE STEEL,
I feel you, brother. We incredibly handsome fellows go through existential crises just like the normals, although ours are usually precipitated by awards shows and gasoline fights. Try devoting yourself to a worthy cause, like kids who don’t read good and want to learn to do other stuff good too. (Okay, just assume I make a few more Zoolander jokes here.)
Try going outside instead of sitting around quoting movies. Be more like Hansel and less like David Duchovny. Stop looking at yourself in the mirror and go have an adventure out in the sun. Admittedly, with winter coming, we’re probably not going to actually see the sun until March. You’d actually probably be better off staying inside, admiring your reflection, and quoting movies. I guess there really isn’t more to life than being really, really, really, ridiculously good-looking.
Don’t kill the Malaysian prime minister,
Patrick Hoskins

Before the current crop of streaming services, before the iPod, portable CD players and even before the Sony Walkman and mass-produced vinyl records, you had to go to a concert hall to hear music. Music was a luxury, performed by orchestras, and was therefore only as portable as all of the musicians. As technology has developed, however, it has influenced both our consumption of music and the production of music.
Enter Edison and the gramophone, the ancestor to what would be vinyl records. At the time, it was heralded as a wonder of the modern world, a wonderfully accurate reproduction of voice. Vinyl brought music to the masses: It could be mass-produced cheaply and offered high sound accuracy. The accuracy of vinyl — and the reason that audiophiles still prefer it — is because a compact disc reproduces a continuous signal, whereas there are infinite values within which to create sound on a vinyl record.
When music reached the age of cassette tapes, we had applied math to sample music accurately enough so that there was no theoretical difference between the discrete signal stored on magnetic tape and the indentations on the grooves of a record. Music of the time reflected this change: Just think of the musical difference between the sounds of the ’60s and the sounds of the early ’80s. I’ve heard many references to the difference in audio quality from cassette to early CDs, a difference that most certainly affected the production of music at the time.
What changed between a CD and a MP3? They’re the same, right? The simple answer is no. The math necessary to store music on a CD and an MP3 are similar, but an MP3 requires something more, something commonly referred to as a codec. I claim that the music of today is written rhythmically and sonically to be accurately captured by the math of MP3. We have entered a point where the music adapts to technology, not the other way around, a notion that may threaten the art of music.

Chris Evans stars as Steve Rogers, an unlikely hero due to his small stature. Despite being rejected for military service for World War II, Rogers gets the chance to serve his country after being injected with a “super-soldier” serum. Now muscular, tall, and formidable, Rogers earns his title “Captain America” as an integral force in the American army. The film also partly serves as a prequel for the upcoming movie The Avengers, which stars other Marvel superheroes such as Iron Man, Thor, and the Hulk.

Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Facebook, spoke to and answered questions from approximately 900 Carnegie Mellon students on Tuesday in Wiegand Gym at the University Center.
The students in attendance were mostly from the School of Computer Science and the department of electrical and computer engineering; however, his talk was later uploaded to the internet via an unauthorized live-stream video for all to see.
Carnegie Mellon was one of three universities that Zuckerberg chose to visit on this trip. The other two were Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
“When we organized this trip to go see a few colleges, Carnegie Mellon was at the top of the list,” Zuckerberg explained at his talk. “The students at Carnegie Mellon who have come to Facebook are among our most productive people.... I don’t know what you do to them.”
“We beat them,” joked Associate Dean of the School of Computer Science Mark Stehlik, who moderated Zuckerberg’s talk.
Although Facebook employees had requested that the event be held behind closed doors, a member of the audience posted a video recording of the event on the now-offline website ipaytuition.com.
“You and I both pay Carnegie Mellon tens of thousands of dollars each year. Yet, over 90 percent of the campus doesn’t have any chance to hear Mark Zuckerberg speak while he’s on our campus,” read the website’s description. “Not offering all members of the campus community the opportunity to watch the talk isn’t right.”
At the event, Stehlik first asked Zuckerberg some questions about Facebook’s history with Carnegie Mellon and recruiting, and then he opened the floor to pre-selected student questions from the audience.
“Most of the questions were about Facebook, and if a question vaguely touched on Zuckerberg’s personal life, he would bring it back to Facebook somehow,” said junior electrical and computer engineering major Alex Klarfeld, who was in the audience during the speech, after the event. 
“When Zuckerberg was asked what his favorite website other than Facebook was, and his favorite internet meme, his responses were along the lines of, ‘I don’t really know any internet memes ... and I just really like Facebook,’ ” he explained. 
During the event, Zuckerberg frequently stated that the future of Facebook and social media would be the application of the consumer knowledge gathered by social media to other industries.
“We’re just starting to get to a place where everyone has these advanced smartphones, and we recently just got to a place where you can assume that everyone has a Facebook or Twitter account with all of these social connections,” Zuckerberg explained during his speech. “I tell the company all the time that the last five years have been mostly about ramping up this graph of connections ... and the next five years will [be] about all the things we can build on top of that.”
However, junior physics major Joel Lu surprised everyone at the event when he described how he had hidden a device underneath the stage. 
“At the end of all the questions, a crazed Zuckerberg fanboy stood up and started shouting that he had a question for ‘Mr. Zuckerberg,’ ” Klarfeld recalled. 
“Stehlik reluctantly allowed him to ask him his question, since he was acting strangely during the entirety of Zuckerberg’s talk,” Klarfeld explained, describing the situation. “He stood up and told us all that he had ‘something’ for ‘Mr. Zuckerberg’ hidden under the stage, and went on a long detailed explanation about how he snuck into Wiegand. I know that most of us were pretty terrified that there was a bomb under the stage.”
“The night before ... I duct taped together a wireless router to my iPod and then hooked it up to some speakers,” Lu explained at the end of the event’s Q & A session. “I then snuck into the UC at night and hid under the stage for a while to set up the device.”
According to Lu, he had intended to remotely activate the device, which would then play his question to Zuckerberg. However, he explained that the device did not work because someone unplugged the power cable before the event.
When his equipment failed, Lu had to ask his question in person: “A lot of communications are moving towards mobile devices where Facebook is sort of a third party application, and I know third party applications usually retain only 5 percent usage after a month. Does that in any way threaten Facebook, and are you looking for electrical engineering and computing and computer science majors to find a Facebook-centric device as a solution?”
Zuckerberg replied, “We’re a pretty small company relative to the companies that are building these phones.... Building whole operating systems and devices is challenging for us, and we think we can get a lot more leverage by focusing on API ... and building great apps that everyone can use everywhere.”
Although Lu later admitted that what he did was “not the most intelligent thing to do,” he explained that he wanted to stand out to Zuckerberg from among the nearly 1,000 students at the event. 
“I thought in order to [ask him my question] I would have to impress him enough to show that somebody has his vision,” Lu said when he explained the idea behind using the device. “The device I thought that he would be making was a communications device that pushes content to help people talk to each other, so I made a device that pushes content that also helps people communicate.”
“On the whole, it was a fairly entertaining talk, and I think it really got people pumped up about working at Facebook,” Klarfeld remarked. “Though, after the whole fanboy incident, I do not think Zuckerberg will be returning to Carnegie Mellon anytime soon.”

Diaspora co-founder Ilya Zhitomirskiy has passed away at the age of 22. 
TechCrunch broke the news Sunday, reporting that “word began to spread around the tech community.”
Zhitomirskiy was one of the four students at New York University who launched the highly successful Diaspora project. 
The project, as stated in an October email from the team, described the network as a place “where you’ll have total control over your privacy, identity, and data.”  
Begun as a Kickstarter project with a goal of $10,000, the project raised over $200,000. Many publications claimed that the high response to the project may have been in response to the privacy-invasive environment created by Facebook. 
The cause of his death has not yet been reported.

Former Congresswomen Beverly Byron (D–Md.) and Sue Kelly (R–N.Y.) visited Carnegie Mellon last week as part of the Congress to Campus program. 
Byron and Kelly spoke with a group of about two dozen Carnegie Mellon and local high school students about the side of elected office that they say voters do not understand.
Kelly, whose house was damaged by the recent storms along the East Coast, spent the first several minutes of her interview with The Tartan on the phone trying to deal with a furnace which had exploded.
“Stuff like that happens to you in Congress, and no one stops to think about it,” Kelly said. “Furnaces blow up. Airplanes get canceled. 
Families have babies, dogs die, all kinds of things that you think of as your normal path of life, and if you’re in Washington, D.C., what are you going to do?”
“The people in Washington operate in a bubble. The press in Washington operates in a bubble. They don’t realize that we’re people with the same problems that everybody else has,” Kelly added.
However, according to Byron, people in Congress help each other out. 
She told a story about the time when her son was to be commissioned in the Air Force in Texas, but to attend the ceremony, she would have had to miss a vote on a budget. Representative Ron Dellums (D–N.C.) prolonged debate on an unrelated bill for a day so that Byron could visit her son without missing the vote. In return, a year and a half later, Byron convinced the House Republicans to cut short debate and call a vote so Dellums could attend his son’s wedding. 
They did this for each other despite the fact that she and Dellums differ ideologically.
“Those are the kind of things that members do for each other,” Byron said. “How can you explain that to a constituent? They don’t understand.”
Byron and Kelly said that the reason Congress finds it hard to get anything done is because cooperation between ideologically diverse representatives is on the decline.
“We were all friends. And I don’t see those friendships developing today within the two-party system, which is unfortunate,” Byron said.
“The art of negotiation isn’t dead,” Kelly explained. “It’s just at a stalemate right now because of the enormous push from the radical wings of both parties.”
Byron and Kelly, self-proclaimed moderates, still argued over which party was originally responsible for the decay of relations. Kelly laid the blame on the Democrats; Byron said that the Republicans had their share of blame. 
However, both women blamed the disconnect between constituents and their representatives in part for the eventual losses of their Congressional seats.
According to Byron, she lost in the 1992 primary election because unions used a short visit she took to Barbados in order to refuel a plane to paint her as someone living the high life. 
The situation was too complex to explain in a commercial or sound byte, Byron explained.
“It’s like watching a big engine coming down on you,” Byron said. “And there’s nothing you can do about it.”
Kelly blames her 2006 loss to Democrat John Hall largely on her connections to the Mark Foley scandal.
In 2006, Republican Congressman Mark Foley was accused of sending sexually suggestive messages to teenaged Congressional pages. 
“I lost to a man who built a whole lot of websites,” Kelly said. “He went after me because I had been the chairman of the page board. The Mark Foley scandal happened after I was gone and resigned. His ads said, ‘She should have known.’ ”
According to The New York Times, Kelly was chairman of the page board from 1998 to 2001. The Washington Post reports that Foley sent the messages in question from 1995 to 2003. No evidence was ever found that Kelly was aware of Foley’s actions, and no charges were ever brought against Foley.
Sophomore international relations and politics major Sandra Yeh, who attended the talk, said that the representatives’ stories made her think about the difference between what the public sees and what really goes on in politics.
“I was definitely more aware of what goes on in our government,” Yeh said. “And of how media can really be twisted to someone’s advantage or disadvantage. It really leads me to question the Herman Cain scandal, for instance.”
Yeh said that she also learned about the daily workings of the government. “You learn that bureaucracy does infiltrate every level of government,” she said.

Internships and free ice cream: a combination for students to enjoy on Tuesday evening at the Career and Professional Development Center’s “Internships: The Inside Scoop.”
Held in the University Center’s Rangos Hall, the self-described “ice cream social and internship fair” gave attendees the opportunity to converse with current Carnegie Mellon students who held internship positions last summer.
Renée Starek, the Mellon College of Science career consultant and assistant director of the Career and Professional Development Center, said that the program began three years ago, with an MCS student who wanted to share her internship experience with other students. 
Starek stated that the event “shows the broad range of options” available to students, and she encouraged those interested in getting a summer internship to make an appointment with their career consultant.
As students entered the room, they were greeted with a bag of candy and flyers from the career center. Every internship had its own table, all of which were organized alphabetically, giving the event an appearance similar to that of miniature TOC. 
Some of the most notable names included the Smithsonian, SpaceX, Thermofisher Scientific, Highmark, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, and Apple. 
Eric Pripstein, a senior materials science and engineering major, spoke of his experience working for Northrop Grumman, a defense contractor, the previous summer. “The guy who was reading my résumé asked about the tools they had and whether I could use them,” Pripstein said. Thinking back to his education, he found that “the stuff I learned was directly applicable.” 
However, he recalled the internship search process with a decidedly less favorable tone. “Finding an internship is not easy,” Pipstein said, calling the process “demoralizing at times.” He described how Lockheed Martin had flown him out to Texas for an interview, promised to get back to him promptly, and never did. Pripstein’s advice for students searching for an internship for the coming summer was, “Start searching early and get as many applications in as you can.”
These words were echoed by Celete Kato, a senior decision science and international relations and politics major. 
Kato interned for Command Consulting Group, a security consulting agency that works with government agencies such as the Secret Service and border protection. Her work at Command Consulting included proposal writing, scheduling, showing a Haitian delegation around Washington, D.C., and assisting in the redesign of the company’s website and integration of social media tools.
Kato applied for the position while enrolled in the Washington Semester program at Georgetown. Her advice to students looking for an internship was to first “reach out to the internship advisors,” then “weed out what you don’t want to do.”
However, Kato also emphasized that students should not be afraid to seize new opportunities, even if they seem like things the students may not enjoy.
The attendees seemed to appreciate the messages and advice given by the presenting students.
Ronny Ho, a sophomore business major, remarked that “it’s really good to get a student’s perspective” on internship opportunities, and contrasted the experience with that of EOC and TOC. She also mentioned that the free ice cream was a positive component of the event. 
First-year economics and statistics major Adrian Botta also spoke well of the event, saying that he attended because he “wanted to learn more about consulting firms and to network a bit.”
While the event received an overall positive reception by attendees, some students expressed the sentiment that many of the internships represented were technical in nature, offering fewer opportunities for writing and other humanities majors.
Students seemed pleased to have the opportunity to hear about internships and receive advice from their peers — or at the very least get some free ice cream.

The Chinese Student Association (CSA) hosted the Chinese Cultural Late Night in the University Center on Friday night.
The highlight of the event was a show by the band Free Bullet, comprised of six Carnegie Mellon students — two from mainland China, one from Taiwan, one from India, one from Korea, and one from the U.S.
Besides the live concert, CSA also offered free bubble tea, Chinese board games, and karaoke, one of the most popular entertainment activities in China. However, due to certain technical problems, the karaoke equipment did not work. 
“Through this event, we hope to spread Chinese culture, to make CSA a more active club, to make Chinese culture more mainstream in this school,” said Chang Qi, a junior mathematics major and the organizer of the Late Night event. 
She explained that last year’s Chinese Cultural Late Night was a combination of traditional and modern culture, but this time CSA focused more on modern Chinese culture, as evidenced by the Chinese pop music.
Jiaxing Yu, a first-year electrical and computer engineering major, said, “It’s a nice try to reach out for CSA, and people are really interested in this. Except for the not very Chinese band performance — otherwise it would be perfect.”
Since most of the songs Free Bullet played were American pop songs, several students said that they enjoyed the music, but did not know that it was specifically a Chinese Cultural Late Night event. 
Elliot Rosen, another first-year electrical and computer engineering major, said, “I had no idea, really. I was just there for the music. I didn’t know it was a Chinese culture thing, even though nearly everyone was Chinese ... but the music was good because I don’t see live music that much.”
Free Bullet was formed one month ago, according to the band leader, Pei Pang, a senior mathematics major.
“The thing is that we are a new band,” Pang said. “We tried to get all the connections we have to have shows. I’m very familiar with CSA.... Actually my old band played for them last year, but definitely the new band is better than the old band. It’s just a revisit to the show.” 
Pang also mentioned that it was hard for his new band to play Chinese pop music because the group is so international. 
“If we play a Chinese song, it’s probably kind of sad to [non-Chinese members],” he said. Yet Pang said they might incorporate more Asian or Chinese elements into their music in the future. 
“My drummer actually mentioned that he wants more exotic elements in the songs,” he said. “He thinks it’s pretty cool.”
Chinese Cultural Late Night is just one of the events celebrating Asian Heritage Month throughout November. There will be a Taiwanese Culture Night in the University Center on Nov. 19.

INI, EWF awards fellowships to CMU master’s students
The Information Networking Institute (INI) and Alta Associates’ Executive Women’s Forum (EWF) on Information Security, Risk Management and Privacy awarded Dolly Karaba and Jonida Cali, both master’s students in INI, fellowships for their graduate studies.
Karaba will receive the EWF-INI Fellowship, an educational award providing full tuition and a mentor. 
As a result of the fellowship, she will be enrolled in the Master of Science in Information Technology-Information Security  Program, conducted at Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley campuses.
“The INI program is helping me gain wonderful experience in areas of technology that will help me in a very competitive global marketplace,” Karaba said in a university press release.
Cali will be the first to receive the EWF-INI Tara Darbyshire Fellowship, which provides research assistance to a first-year graduate student specializing in information security research.
The Archer Foundation, an organization which helps students to reach their educational goals, provided $40,000 for Cali’s fellowship. Darbyshire is a founding member of EWF and co-founder of the Archer Foundation.
“We are thrilled to support Jonida in her pursuit of educational and professional excellence,” Darbyshire said in a university press release.
Scientists capture nature in photos for second GigaBlitz
Scientists from around the world have been documenting biodiversity through high-resolution photos since June in preparation for the second GigaBlitz, scheduled for the week of Dec. 19–26. The GigaBlitz project is organized by a trio of biologists and their partners at Carnegie Mellon’s CREATE Lab.
The GigaBlitz project asks people to capture high-resolution panoramic images of their backyards, nearby woodlots, or adjacent vacant lots. 
Participants from across the globe can then access these images and identify species in them.
“The idea is that biodiversity isn’t something you find just in a distant national park or some far-flung field site, but it’s around all of us, all of the time,” said Ken Tamminga, professor of landscape architecture at Penn State University and one of the event organizers, in a university press release. “Gigapixel imagery is a means for us to record and share data for sites that may be widely separated, but nevertheless are part of our everyday lives.”
Tamminga and the other organizers of the GigaBlitz project currently hope to expand the number of participants and sites, while simultaneously trying to encourage previous participants to revisit their sites and update the changes in their habitats.

The Humanities Center Lectures: Imagining Planetarity
Tuesday at 4:30 p.m
.
Adamson Wing (Baker Hall 136A)
Istvan Csicsery-Ronay, a professor of English at DePauw University and author of The Seven Beauties of Science Fiction, will be discussing his new book and the current theories on science fiction. His lecture is titled “Alien Earth: Science Fiction, Posthumanism, and The Planet.”
Csicsery-Ronay will share his thoughts on how the international popularity of the science fiction genre has become one of the main factors behind the social imagination of hyper-modernization. He believes that it has become more than a literary genre, that it is now a way of thinking about the world.
Biomedical Engineering Seminar Series
Tuesday at 4:30 p.m.
Doherty Hall 1212
SuPing Lyu, the senior principal scientist and technical fellow at Medtronic Corporate Science and Technology, will give a lecture titled “Implantable Medical Devices and the Research.”
Lyu’s seminar will focus on two topics: the implantable medical devices that are in today’s market and the devices that are needed for the future. He will discuss how industrial scientists and engineers conduct their research to develop products. Graduate students interested in industrial careers are encouraged to attend.
“Beyond the Standard Model of Cosmology: Dark Energy, Neutrinos, and Primordial Non-Gaussianity”
Thursday at 9:30 p.m.

Gerald “Jerry” Sandusky — a former assistant football coach at Penn State University — was arrested and charged with multiple counts of sexual abuse of young boys. As a result of his arrest and charges, Penn State’s board of trustees decided to fire the head coach, Joe Paterno, and the university’s president, Graham Spanier. Here are some facts about the case:
40: the number of counts of sexual abuse Sandusky is charged with
2002: the year Mike McQueary, a graduate assistant coach at Penn State, found Sandusky sexually abusing a 10-year-old boy in the locker room
2009: the year Pennsylvania's attorney general launched an investigation of Sandusky
46: the number of years Paterno was coach before his recent dismissal

What a week it has been for Penn State University. 
The once-beloved football program, with Joe Paterno at the helm, has always been considered worthy of imitation and has achieved great success over Paterno’s 50-plus years with the team. That is, until this week. 
This week, allegations of the most heinous sort were revealed against former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky, who has long been an iconic figure in Penn State football. Sandusky was even considered to be the successor to Paterno many years ago, before he retired for reasons that are now known to us. 
For 15 years, Sandusky headed a program called The Second Mile, a charity that was meant to help young boys who were having social problems or failing in school. The program was nationally acclaimed by many, including sports icon Cal Ripken Jr. and former President George W. Bush. 
Little did they know that Sandusky was using the charity as a way to sexually abuse young boys.
In the wake of the accusations, Penn State had a ton of difficult decisions to make. If the stories are true, many high-ranking Penn State sports coaches and employees knew about the claims against Sandusky and chose not to report him to the proper authorities. Penn State has since decided to fire many of those who are guilty of “neglect,” including legendary coach Paterno. 
Paterno, for all he has done for college football and Penn State football specifically, clearly failed society by only reporting Sandusky to his athletic director. When someone accuses another of taking advantage of a small child, the correct thing to do is to immediately call 911. Paterno decided that the correct thing to do was to tell the athletic director, who promptly swept the accusations under the rug. Paterno went on with his jolly good life, sitting up in the coach’s box and continuing to strengthen his legacy. Now, it’s come back to hurt him. 
It seems as if the student body of Penn State has taken offense to the firing of Paterno. After watching a few videos of the riots, it’s clear that these students are blinded by school spirit and fail to see the bigger picture. Many students claim to understand the magnitude of the situation, but flipping a news car is not the way to go about remedying it.
Paterno deserved to be fired; he basically turned his back on child molestation happening in his own facilities. Penn State students will tell you about all Paterno has done for the school, his demeanor, and what he has done for college football as a whole. They have no way to respond when you ask them what he has done for the victims of Jerry Sandusky.
One thing I don’t understand about the way Penn State has handled the scandal is why assistant coach Mike McQueary, who is currently the stand-in coach, is still employed by Penn State. 
Yes, he has recently been put on “administrative leave,” but what does that mean? 
McQueary should have been the first one gone, because he is the person who reportedly witnessed a crime by Sandusky. If anyone should be charged for not reporting the crime, it should be him. It seems as if Penn State wanted to make a statement by firing Paterno and higher employees, but is trying to keep some of Paterno’s regime at the university in order to continue to build its football program. I may be wrong, and McQueary’s firing may be imminent, but the student body does have one thing right. Penn State should fire McQueary as soon as possible; putting him on “administrative leave” is not good enough. 
I can only hope the students come to understand the need for ridding the university of child molesters and those who protect them. It’s sad that it has had to come to this, but it looks like Penn State will need to clean house to make things right.

With the end of the semester approaching, the registrar’s office and professors across the university will soon be sending out their semesterly Faculty Course Evaluation (FCE) reminders. As inconsequential as clicking all of those online checkboxes may seem, students have an important role to play in determining the progress of our instructors’ careers.
Just ask Steven Maranville, a former business professor at Utah Valley University. 
In a lawsuit Maranville filed against the university last month, he claimed he was denied tenure because students didn’t like his Socratic teaching style. Allegedly lauded as a “master teacher” by his department chair and praised by his fellow professors, Maranville said he was denied a promised promotion because students wanted him to lecture instead of asking questions and assigning group work. The suit, reported by Inside Higher Ed two weeks ago, is still pending.
What the Maranville case highlights is the dual necessity of providing meaningful feedback (on the part of students) and interpreting it appropriately (on the part of university officials). “My professor doesn’t just give us the answers” or “I don’t like working in a group” is not the type of complaint that can help university officials properly judge a professor’s competence. It won’t help our professors get better at teaching, and it should not serve as an excuse to deny a professor an otherwise deserved promotion. Many students spend five minutes or less filling out a professor’s FCEs, and many more simply don’t bother to fill them out. The idea of a short survey only a small percentage of students bother to fill out that determines the future of a professor seems irrational.
Student feedback should have a role in advancing a professor’s career, but it should be evaluated and deemed reliable.
If feedback from students indeed led to Maranville’s dismissal, Utah Valley administrators need to go back to their student comments and learn to separate the wheat from the chaff. In addition, administrators need to take into account past feedback, professional achievements, and all of the other aspects that make for a successful professor. 
Closer to home, Carnegie Mellon students should make use of semesterly FCEs and other means of providing instructor feedback to make sure our own administrators have enough to make a good harvest. Taking time to fill out an FCE with constructive feedback in mind will not only help the professor and administrators see where improvement is needed, but it will also benefit students in future classes.

Don Delillo is well known in the literary community for his parody of modern American culture. His debut novel, End Zone, served as a mirror for the American public to observe how the Cold War and the military industrial complex invaded every aspect of American life. The character Alan Zapalac noted that “I kept seeing the same word everywhere I was. Store windows. Leaflets in the streets. Advertising space on walls. I kept seeing it for about two weeks. MILITARIZE. It was everywhere — printed, written, scribbled, chalked on walls. I didn’t know what it was all about.”
While this observation was written with the Cold War in mind, it is shockingly reminiscent of the current state of American society. We are not militarizing in order to fight another Cold War or World War III. We are embroiled in a war much scarier and perhaps even more determinant of our nation’s future — class war.
Perhaps classism is inevitable in a capitalist society such as ours; however, in recent months, feelings of resentment between the rich and the not-so-rich have reached dangerous levels. The recent Occupy movements springing up around the country have forced the government and society as a whole to come to terms with a myriad of issues — including the ever-increasing income gap, the steadily rising amount of student debt, the shrinking job market, and the inefficiency of our health care system — and by extension the animosity between people of different economic statuses.
However, these strong emotions do not need to end in violent uprisings à la Egypt or Yemen. Through communication and compromise, we could resolve the issues that so bitterly divide our nation. This involves, among other things, each class understanding the nuances and difficulties in the lives of those in the other classes.
As Kyle Henson stated in his article “Flat tax is in alignment with founding fathers’ vision of United States,” the wealthy should be seen as role models in this regard. He states that it should be the “1 percent” that sets the precedent for understanding “how the other half lives.”
To begin with, the notion that Horatio Alger’s bibliography is a suitable medium to learn how to succeed needs to be dispelled immediately. The fact is, “working your butt off” does not in fact always lead to success. You could be a single parent of two trying to get your kids through school and trying to hold down several jobs, or you could be a college graduate with over $20,000 of student loans trying to support an ailing family member without health insurance, or you could spend your entire life serving in the military and come back to a nation with a failing economy that is unable to provide you with employment.
The fact is, there are innumerable reasons why people live in poverty that have nothing to do with the choices those people made. So if you were lucky enough to be born into a family that could ensure your education, was rich enough to make sure you never had to support anyone but yourself or graduate with a substantial amount of student loans, and was well connected enough to guarantee that you were hired directly after graduation, then congratulations, you get to be rich. But you did not get there by “working your butt off” — you got there because of the same factors that are keeping others, who may be working even harder than you, from living comfortably.
In addition to that, government welfare programs such as unemployment benefits, Medicaid, and Medicare are not “handouts,” as Henson so derisively deems them — they are necessities for people who are not rich enough to afford a number of essential needs. 
Henson stated that American citizens should only be guaranteed the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, yet he fails to mention how these programs save lives daily and thus allow people in poverty to live freely and, if luck be with them, pursue their dreams.
Horribly misguided ideas such as these are more unpatriotic than any Occupy protest or piece of “socialist” legislation that the Obama administration is considering passing. It is hard to comprehend how a population that is so focused on maintaining a mindset of an “American” economy can so completely abandon the idea of social justice — the idea that we have so proudly touted as the American way. 
Dressing up as Occupy protesters at Halloween parties, showering protesters in McDonald’s applications (fun fact: this past National Hiring Day, McDonald’s accepted less than one-tenth of applications), and degrading the unemployed and impoverished undermines the sense of solidarity that this nation was founded upon. 
There is only one way to prevent the sentiments of mistrust and resentment from escalating any further without tarnishing the reputation of the United States — reconcile our differences and stand, once again, as a united nation. They say that money makes the world go around; go look at a dollar bill. E pluburis unum — out of many, one.

The Port Authority of Allegheny County has a Twitter account, @PGHtransit, intended to keep the patrons of Pittsburgh’s public transportation informed of news related to their commuting needs. In theory, @PGHtransit should notify tech-savvy bus riders when a bus is running late or when routes will be changed due to parades, marathons, and other city events. 
However, Brian O’Neill of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that the Twitter system is flawed due to the Port Authority’s inability to find the manpower to manage its Twitter account. 
The issues with Pittsburgh’s public transportation are so numerous, and sometimes so miniscule, that it would be both impossible and inconsequential to report every delay that occurs.
Twitter, while one of the largest names in 21st-century web services, has primarily caught on only with those on the cutting edge of technology. I’m a late adopter and only recently signed up for Twitter myself. This was mainly to understand what these darn kids are talking about, with all their “hash-tags” and their Ashton Kutchers. 
After spending some time on Twitter and looking at the Port Authority’s account, it doesn’t seem like Twitter is an effective medium for the Port Authority to notify bus users of irregularities. Although we live in an area highly populated by college students and other youth who may be tech-savvy, I feel that the demographics of the average Twitter user and the average bus rider have a very small overlap. 
Yet, even if I’m mistaken about the adoption rate of Twitter among bus riders, the poor implementation of such a system still highlights the failure of the medium for this task. After looking through the Port Authority’s most recent tweets, I noticed three things. 
First, most of the tweets were various dialogues back and forth between individuals about specific problems. Second, tweets were being used to advertise discounts for bus riders at a Wexford jewelry store. Seriously.
Finally, and most indicative of the poor implementation of Twitter by the Port Authority, its tweet this past Thursday stated, “Signing off per Twitter hours. We’ll be back Monday. Customer Service open tomorrow at 412-442-2000 & detours posted at portauthority.org.”
Efforts are made to respond to individuals’ requests through tweets, and the Port Authority has the ability to advertise irrelevant discounts and perks for bus riders, yet it doesn’t have the manpower to maintain minimal Twitter services throughout the weekend? This clearly demonstrates that the problem with this system isn’t its lack of staff, but its lack of direction and execution needed when it comes to using Twitter.
New technology by its very nature creates potential that individuals and institutions want to take full advantage of, yet poor implementation of the technology may be worse than not implementing it at all. While there may be a host of third-party websites and apps that intend to solve Pittsburgh’s transit issues, the fact that I can’t name one shows fault with its effectiveness, its marketing, or both. 
As for the Port Authority, it has two options to help the good people who ride its buses: Either focus Twitter efforts to inform the public of relevant transit delays and route changes, or get the buses to arrive on time.

When Michael Jackson's personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, was recently convicted for killing Jackson, the King of Pop’s legions of fans became desperate in their wish to see the doctor put behind bars. While there is something quite illogical about the fervent following this case has developed, there are deeper issues here than a few rabid fans. It comes down to who holds the responsibility for Jackson’s death.
Yes, ultimately Jackson was a drug addict, and as such he had a skewed view of what he needed and what he simply craved. However, as a physician, Murray took an oath to use good judgment and awareness in his actions as a doctor. In this case, his actions were simply irresponsible. No matter how high-profile his client was, Murray should have acknowledged the fact that Jackson’s condition made his judgment extremely poor. On top of that, Murray made several mistakes in addition to administering Jackson dangerous drugs in an uncontrolled setting.
During the trial, Murray admitted that he had left his post and returned to find the pop star in critical condition. He delayed calling for help several minutes as he tried to revive Jackson single-handedly, and when the paramedics finally arrived, Murray did not inform them that Jackson was administered a dose of Propofol, a surgical sedative.
Nobody can be sure of who delivered the fatal dose of Propofol. Defense lawyers argued that it could have been the ill-behaved star who administered it to himself. Although possible, this is beside the point.
Jackson’s death, and Murray’s resulting manslaughter conviction, is about more than a celebrity’s drug addiction or even the celebrity himself. It is about the trust that society should be able to have in doctors. As a personal physician, Murray should have devoted himself not just to pleasing his client, but also to providing his client with the best care possible and promoting his health. Ultimately, nobody is the victor in this trial. Both Jackson and Murray made sizable mistakes and both men paid for it: Jackson with his life and Murray with his career.

Over the last week, revelations regarding a single man’s molestation and rape of young boys have shaken not only the administration at the largest university in Pennsylvania, but also the trust in the entire Penn State University football enterprise.
Last Saturday, a 23-page grand jury report detailed longtime assistant coach Jerry Sandusky’s improper relations with at least eight boys over the course of the past 15 years. The report documented multiple eyewitness accounts of Sandusky taking advantage of the children he met through the charity he founded, The Second Mile, as well as “materially false statements” made by other Penn State administrators to protect Sandusky. Until this month, Sandusky had only suffered the trivial punishment of having his athletic center keys revoked.
However, the response from the Penn State community, following the removal of the university’s president Graham Spanier and revered football coach Joe Paterno, has been mixed at best. While many community members are acting to show empathy for Sandusky’s victims, others have taken to the streets to protest the removal of Paterno — their father figure, their revered coach, and the leader of their collegiate pride. This impenetrable support, expressed by so many, highlights the unhealthy culture that has developed around the Nittany Lions. Juxtaposed against the sexual abuse scandals that the Roman Catholic Church frequently weathers, we question if academia should support collegiate football raised to the level of devout religion.
While pride in Carnegie Mellon sports teams is a phenomenon found in few of our students, we do hold academics in high esteem. However, we don’t believe that news of a faculty or staff member allowing the commission of heinous acts would incite riots in support of said faculty or staff member. We have not built a culture of blind trust in our leaders; we follow them because we believe in and support their actions, their reasoning, and the decisions they present to us.
But a few firings won’t reverse the sentiment that Penn State football brings out in thousands across the state. Paterno was head coach for 44 years. He built not just the team itself, but also the image and the brand that surrounds it. 
His firing will not remove his influence. All of the coaching staff worked under him, and most were hired by him — his own son is the quarterback coach.
These coaches as well as others in Penn State’s administration were responsible for hiding Sandusky’s wrongdoings, but who can say what other smaller incidents they have hidden in order to maintain an image of honesty, perfection, and loyalty? They were considered infallible, and now their reputation is shattered. We encourage Penn State to dismantle its remaining shields and restructure into a more open, responsible organization.

No doubt Carnegie Mellon students were fascinated by Facebook founder and titan Mark Zuckerberg during his recent appearance on campus. He sets a shining example of spectacular entrepreneurial success and of the extraordinary wealth that has accompanied it.
However, I hope that no students at elite Carnegie Mellon will seek to emulate Zuckerberg’s slovenly attire. I find it incongruous for a corporate executive, even one at the tender age of 27 like Zuckerberg, to eschew neckties and jackets in important public appearances.
When we eliminate elements of decorum and respect for one’s audience, we lose some of what has made our society great. Is business attire no longer associated with a business school?
