Men’s Cross Country
On Saturday, Oct. 8, the men’s cross country team hosted the Carnegie Mellon University Invitational in Schenley Park. A total of 12 teams participated, including a team of Carnegie Mellon alumni. The Tartans placed second and the alumni team placed fourth. 
Senior Zachary Nowak was the first Tartan to finish, placing third with a time of 25:51.1. First-year Thomas Damiani was the next Tartan to finish with a time of 26:24.8, earning him 14th. Sophomore Seth Williams was two spots behind Damiani with a time of 26:36.3. Carnegie Mellon alumnus Josh Kalapos won the race with a time of 25:49.9.
The Tartans will be racing next Saturday with an 11:15 a.m. start at the Oberlin Interregional Rumble.
Women’s Cross Country
The women’s cross country team also hosted the Carnegie Mellon University Invitational this past Saturday in Schenley Park. The Tartans placed seventh out of 12 teams.
Junior Megan Baker took 19th with a time of 19:52.8, leading the Tartans. Sophomores Lauren May and Norah Czajka finished the race together, placing 31st and 32nd, respectively, with times of 20:23.7 and 20:24.0.
The team will next be heading to the Oberlin Interregional Rumble next Saturday with a 10:30 a.m. start.
Football
The #18-ranked football team has kept up their undefeated streak this season with a 27-20 victory over Waynesburg on Oct. 8. 
After a scoreless first quarter, the Tartans were the first team to get on the board with a one-yard run from first-year Joey McGinnis IV after an 84-yard drive. A fumble recovery by junior Jacob Nash gave the Tartans another opportunity to score in the second quarter; a 10-yard run from first-year Willem Bouma but a failed point-after attempt gave the Tartans a 13-0 lead. However, the Yellow Jackets only needed two plays after to get on the board with a 52 yard catch-and-run, which they followed with a field goal, making it 13-10. 
Five-and-a-half minutes into the third quarter, Waynesburg scored another field goal to make it a tie-game, 13-13. A touchdown from junior Ben Mills to sophomore Ben Condemi in Carnegie Mellon’s next possession gave the Tartans the lead back, 20-13. This didn’t last long; Waynesburg responded with a touchdown of their own, making it a tie game once again. 
However, with just over a minute left on the clock, a touchdown pass to sophomore Dominic Voiland gave the Tartans the lead back, 27-20. A last-minute interception by junior Adrian Williams during Waynesburg’s final possession guaranteed the Tartan’s win. 
The Carnegie Mellon football team is currently on a 13-game winning streak — the longest active in Division III football, which also matches the school-record streak. The Tartans will look to keep their undefeated record when they travel to Washington & Jefferson on Saturday, Oct. 15 for a 1:00 p.m. kickoff.
Men’s Soccer
The #14-ranked men’s soccer team traveled to Brandeis on Saturday, Oct. 8 to take on the Judges. Despite a mostly scoreless game, the Tartans were able to take home a victory thanks to a goal in the 80th minute from senior Dante Mancini following a free kick from senior Josh Baugh. This victory moved the Tartans to a record of 9-1-1 on the season and 1-1-0 in conference play. This win snapped a 0-5-2 record against the Judges since 2013. 
The soccer team will be traveling to the University of Chicago next Friday, Oct. 14 for a 2:00 p.m. CDT kickoff. 
Women’s Soccer
The #13 women’s soccer team took on Brandeis this weekend on Saturday, Oct. 8 for their second conference game of the season. The Tartans scored the only goal of the game in the 29th minute when sophomore Catherine MacHichol sunk the ball in the net thanks to an assist from Vivian Wang. The Tartans record is now 7-1-2 for the season, with a 1-0-1 in conference play. 
The women’s soccer team will be heading to the University of Chicago on Friday, Oct. 14 for a 4:30 p.m. kickoff. 
Women’s Volleyball
This past Friday, Oct. 7, the women’s volleyball team played Muskingum on their home court. The game went to a fifth set, with the Tartans winning the first two (25-21, 25-22), and the Fighting Muskies rallying back in the next two (21-25, 23-25). In the fifth set, the Tartans took the victory, 15-11. The women’s volleyball team is now 12-3 for the season. 
Highlights include first-year Bella Woodard racking up a total of 14 kills; three other Tartans also recorded double-digit kills — juniors Jane Dean and Laura Reichard, as well as sophomore Avani Seshiah. The Tartans collected a total of seven service aces against the Fighting Muskies, including five from junior Mindee Lai. 
The team’s next match will be on Sunday, Oct. 16 when they return to University Athletic Association play against Case Western Reserve and University of Chicago. They will be traveling to the University of Rochester for a 12:00 p.m. start.

Not a single team in the top 10 lost a game of football this week (and that should make for a short article). But the way that those games went down means this piece will be anything but! While there’s no movement in the bottom seven teams (the teams in the fourth through ninth spots all won comfortably except Oklahoma State, who played a close one through three quarters against Texas Tech, and #10 Penn State had a bye), a narrative is starting to come together around the top three teams -- and it’s not the one everyone had coming into the season.
Our Rankings
 #1 Ohio State (6-0)
 #2 Georgia (6-0)
 #3 Alabama (6-0)
 #4 Michigan (6-0)
 #5 Clemson (6-0)
 #6 USC (6-0)
 #7 Oklahoma State (4-0)
 #8 Tennessee (4-0)
 #9 Ole Miss (5-0)
 #10 Penn State (5-0)
During the offseason, everyone and their mother was of the opinion that the playoff would most likely consist of Georgia, Alabama, Ohio State, and whichever team was lucky enough to tickle the selection committee’s fancy as a sacrifice to the Big Three. Georgia was just coming off a national championship run, with most of their core intact. Alabama, under Heisman quarterback Bryce Young, had a much-improved roster and a chance to go all the way to the championship again. Ohio State had CJ Stroud under center, and even though a substantial chunk of their 2021 roster went to the NFL, what remains is a dangerous team threatening for the title.
Yet here we are, six weeks into the season, and both of those SEC powerhouses have come dangerously close to losing at a point where both are usually undefeated and cruising. Last week, Georgia — who partially made up for it in a rout of Auburn on Saturday — nearly lost to Missouri. The Tigers dominated most of the game, but lost the lead with four minutes to play (and coming within one play of winning a comeback at the end of the fourth quarter). And this week, Alabama — who had an understandable dogfight with Arkansas last week, but won — played Texas A&M. Texas A&M beat Alabama last year, and nearly got away with it again — Alabama let the Aggies get within two yards of a game-winning touchdown when time expired — before Alabama pulled off the win. 
We’re halfway through the season — the point around which our preseason assumptions mean next to nothing, and we take our cues almost entirely from what we’ve seen on the field these past six weeks. And here’s what we’ve seen:
Georgia had a tough schedule: Oregon in Week 1, South Carolina in Week 3, and Auburn in Week 6 are all respectable opponents, and they’ve blown out every one. Sanford, in Week 2, was not a respectable opponent, but they crushed them too. On the flip-side of the coin, though, they struggled against Kent State in Week 4 and almost lost to Missouri in Week 5. Georgia's inconsistent in a way that could cost them a game soon.
Yet Alabama, too, has struggled. Three times this year — against Texas, against Arkansas, and now, against Texas A&M — the Crimson Tide have struggled. These are all good teams; Texas is underrated, A&M has a history of causing them problems, and Arkansas was ranked #8 at the time. But the Tide are in a brutal division and their schedule doesn’t get easier. They don’t play a team with a losing record the rest of the season, and the way they’re playing now, they’ll drop a game or two. And the Tide drop a game or two and can’t win the SEC East — which also-undefeated Ole Miss, who they will play near the end of the season, would very much like to have happen — then the Crimson Tide are not making the playoff. We’re used to them in the postseason but, despite appearances, there’s a real chance that they will miss out this year.
This, of course, brings us to Ohio State. They’ve been at #3 all season, until being promoted to #2 last week after Georgia stumbled. They, of course, don’t have it any easier. Playing in the juggernaut Big Ten East — arguably the best division in college football — Ohio State is the only team left at the top of the table who has yet to stumble. Granted, their schedule has been lacking, and dates with Iowa in Week 8, Penn State in Week 9, and Michigan in Week 13 loom large on the calendar. But all of those games are winnable, and barring any surprises, they’ll be the favorites in every one. Because they’ve been so dominant and because of the sheer strength of their roster, it’s easy to see Ohio State winning out, claiming the Big Ten Championship and waltzing into the playoffs.
That’s why — for the first time this year or last — a non-SEC team is in the top spot. And given what we’ve seen from Alabama and Georgia so far, Ohio State should remain there until they’ve proved that they don’t deserve it. If they can survive their trip to Happy Valley in Week 9 in convincing fashion, barring a loss the rest of the way, their spot is probably secure until they play Michigan to end the season.
The rest of the standings were relatively uneventful. #4 Michigan beat Indiana, 31-10, after a scary first half which saw both a 10-10 game and Michigan coach Mike Hart collapse on the sideline with a stroke (thankfully, he is now in stable condition). #5 Clemson whipped Boston College, and #6 USC handled Washington State. #7 Oklahoma State edged Texas Tech, 41-31, in a game that was tight well into the fourth quarter. At #8, Tennessee demolished an LSU team that was, once upon a time, ranked. At #9, Ole Miss hung 50 on Vanderbilt and, at #10, Penn State had a bye week.
Next Week’s Schedule:
Next week will be, to date, the most exciting of the college football season. Two top 10 vs. top 10 matchups — Alabama and Tennessee in Knoxville, and Penn State and Michigan in Ann Arbor — are likely to see one team, if not two, out of the top 10. But beyond those games, USC plays Utah (ranked eleventh until Saturday’s loss to UCLA), Oklahoma State does battle with TCU (undefeated and in the top fifteen), and Ole Miss plays Auburn, who have underperformed this season but are always a threat. Watch this space because it’s entirely possible that come this time next week, three, four, or even five teams will have fallen out of the top ten.

When 24-year-old Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa got up from a hit against the Buffalo Bills in Week 3, it was immediately clear that something was wrong. The star got to his feet, took a few seemingly normal steps forward down the field, then stumbled awkwardly before collapsing completely. Even to the average NFL fan, it was abundantly clear that Tagovailoa had sustained a head injury, his dizziness and lack of coordination being dead giveaways. 
He immediately exited the game and was put into the league’s concussion protocol to be evaluated further. But just four days later, with the Dolphins playing in the early Thursday night football game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Tagovailoa was the designated starter for the Dolphins, as if he hadn’t missed a beat. In the second quarter, as Tagovailoa scrambled wildly to avoid a sack, he was slung to the ground by a Bengals defensive lineman, collapsing to the turf where he lay motionless. His arms and fingers extended up in a senseless manner, a reaction referred to as the "fencing response," which often occurs following a traumatic brain injury. Fans and players alike are now demanding answers, specifically ones to the question of why the quarterback was even in uniform that Thursday night. That’s where it gets tricky. 
The NFL’s concussion protocol wasn’t always a component of the league. In fact, it only came to conception following numerous studies and player statements concerning head injuries, specifically worries over concussion and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a brain condition that results from numerous head blows. One study cited in the New York Times found that about 320 former NFL players have reported CTE. For these reasons, the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) and the league joined forces to create a commission of sorts that would tackle the issue at a higher level. The task force includes medically trained professionals and neurologists whose primary objective is to diagnose injured players and make decisions on their ability to play in subsequent games. This means that doctors are not only present on the field and sidelines during live games, but they’re also in constant communication with NFL and team personnel regarding player safety. For Tagovailoa, the process that occurred in the week leading up to the Dolphins game concluded that he was good to go, allegedly passing all the tests necessary to be deemed medically approved to play. Head coach Mike McDaniel doubled down on this evaluation, noting that Tagovailoa passed tests with an independent neurologists, including those that were more football-related like recalling strings of words in playcalls. 
In McDaniel’s defense, he’s not entirely wrong. Prior to the Dolphins game, Tagovailoa checked off every concussion guideline constructed by the NFLPA. However, in the follow-up investigation that was initiated, it was decided that ataxia, or neurological malfunction involving a lack of balance and stability, should be added to the list of necessary precautions. If this had existed prior to Tagovailoa's incident, the NFL noted that he would not have been cleared to play. In the wake of this investigation, a neurotrauma consultant for the NFL who was heavily involved in Tagovailoa's diagnosis was promptly fired.
For the NFL, they’ve unsurprisingly received a significant amount of backlash since the event, and it's the league’s turn now to come up with answers and solutions. While the investigation into Tagovailoa's injury and the revision of protocol standards are certainly plusses, there is still significant work to do. The fix can’t be firing individual doctors or making after-the-fact protocol changes in hopes that they will remedy the situation long term, especially when careers — and, more importantly, lives — are at stake.

Yes, it is that time of year — October baseball — something that local Pirates fans may not experience again for a while, given the inept ownership and front office. But unpacking that is for another time.
As the regular season has come to a close, that not only means playoffs but also awards season. So we are going to take a look at all of my pre-season awards picks and evaluate how accurate I was. Disclaimer: I will be quoting some semi-advanced statistics in my analyses, as any mathematically inclined baseball fan should.
AL MVP (Pre-Season Pick: Aaron Judge)
End-of-year Selections:
 #1 NYY Aaron Judge 
 #2 LAA Shohei Ohtani
 #3 CLE José Ramírez
 #4 HOU Yordan Álvarez
 #5 BOS Xander Bogaerts
All rise! I am ready to testify that I picked Aaron Judge before the season began! Honestly … any player willing to turn down a lucrative offer worth $217 million to bet on himself is a good pick to log a career year. And that he did, with one of the greatest all-around offensive seasons in MLB history, slashing .311/.425/.686 with 133 runs batted in (RBIs) and an American League (AL) single-season record in home runs — 62 in total. Some perspective: Any other year, Ohtani wins it, but I have a feeling Shohei may soon need his own category of award every year.
NL MVP (Pre-Season Pick: Juan Soto)
End-of-year Selections:
 #1 STL Nolan Arenado
 #2 STL Paul Goldschmidt
 #3 LAD Freddie Freeman
 #4 SD Manny Machado
 #5 MIA Sandy Alcantara
It is Nolan Arenado’s tenth season in the majors, and this is the year that he will take home his first MVP award. It is no secret that Arenado is the greatest fielding third baseman ever (after Ke’Bryan Hayes of the Pittsburgh Pirates, of course) and among the best offensive ones. With his excellent arm and steady glovework (besides Game 1 of this year’s National League (NL) Wild Card), he will likely win his tenth Gold Glove in as many seasons. To put this into perspective, Arenado has saved a whopping 20 runs above league average this season. Nolan Arenado can also rake at the plate. He possesses a slash line of .293/.358/.533 to go along with 30 home runs and 103 runs batted in (RBI). He has managed to maintain a 154 On-base Plus Slugging Plus (OPS+), meaning he is 54 percent better than the average batter. While Arenado has put up lesser offensive numbers than his teammate Paul Goldschmidt, sabermetric fielding statistics suggest Goldschmidt has been an average first baseman at best. There is no need to compare wins above replacement, as Arenado sits with 7.9 and Goldschmidt at 7.8 — a negligible difference. Being in a different stratosphere defensively is what separates Arenado from Goldschmidt and the rest of the pack. However, Paul Goldschmidt went cold in September and October, which was the straw that broke the camel’s back, leading me to take Arenado as MVP, as he has been able to maintain a higher level of consistency.
AL Cy Young (Pre-Season Pick: Robbie Ray)
End-of-year Selections:
 #1 HOU Justin Verlander
 #2 TOR Alek Manoah
 #3 CHW Dylan Cease
 #4 HOU Framber Valdez
 #5 LAA Shohei Ohtani
39-year-old Justin Verlander already has two Cy Youngs to his name and has finished second three other times. This was just a fantastic comeback from a serious injury for the veteran. While Verlander has pitched 175 innings (17th in the AL), his sheer dominance outweighs his lack of volume. Verlander leads the AL in wins (18), Adjusted Earned Run Average (ERA+) (this statistic takes into account players’ ballparks), walks and hits per inning pitched (WHIP) (0.83), and his 1.75 Earned Run Average (ERA) is miles ahead of everyone. Even though White Sox starting pitcher Dylan Cease has a superb ERA (2.20) — good for second in the AL — that gap is much bigger than it may appear. Verlander would have to tack on almost 43 earned runs to have the same ERA as Cease. This is an easy decision. Give him his crown and book his eventual ticket to Cooperstown.
NL Cy Young (Pre-Season Pick: Walker Buehler)
End-of-year Selections:
 #1 MIA Sandy Alcántara
 #2 ATL Max Fried
 #3 ARI Zac Gallen
 #4 LAD Julio Urías
 #5 NYM Edwin Díaz
As much as this pains me to say, Max Fried is not the NL Cy Young. While he is my favorite pitcher, the award belongs to the greatest right-handed pitcher named Sandy — Sandy Alcántara, that is (Koufax was a lefty, after all). Marlins ace Sandy Alcántara has slammed the door shut on any possibility for there to be any other outcomes. Alcántara’s six complete games are the most since 2014, and he has pitched eight innings in seven more starts. Alcántara is a true workhouse, being the only pitcher to eclipse 200 innings. He has managed to pitch 228.2 innings while also maintaining a 2.28 ERA with 207 strikeouts and a 0.980 WHIP. Being able to provide as good pitching as anyone while also taking the burden off of his bullpen makes Alcántara the best pitcher in baseball, in my eyes.
AL Rookie of the Year (Pre-Season Pick: Bobby Witt, Jr.)
End-of-year Selections:
 #1 SEA Julio Rodríguez
 #2 BAL Adley Rutschman
 #3 HOU Jeremy Peña
 #4 SEA George Kirby
 #5 CLE Steven Kwan
While I believe Adley Rutschman will go down as the superior player and maybe the face of baseball, Julio Rodríguez of the Seattle Mariners did have the best rookie season in the AL — by a considerable margin. Rodríguez has hit .284/.345/.509 with 28 home runs, 75 RBIs, 25 stolen bases, and a 6.0 wins above replacement (WAR) season for Seattle. The 21-year-old’s hitting ability came as no surprise when looking at his minor league production, but it has been his ability to become a better base-runner, a strong center fielder, and an incredibly mature individual that has wowed me and many others. He and his team started very slowly, but when Rodríguez turned it around, the Mariners did, too. I do not think his ascension to greatness and Seattle’s success is a coincidence. Rodríguez was the best player on his team this year and has taken the Mariners to the playoffs. To put this into perspective, the Mariners had failed to reach the playoffs for 20 consecutive seasons. That is Pittsburgh Pirates-level bad. And as a lifelong Pirates fan, it brings me great joy to see Julio Rodríguez’s Mariners succeed.
NL Rookie of the Year (Pre-Season Pick: Oneil Cruz)
End-of-year Selections:
 #1 ATL Michael Harris II
 #2 ATL Spencer Strider
 #3 PIT Oneil Cruz
 #4 STL Brendan Donovan
 #5 CIN Nick Lodolo
The Atlanta Braves have somehow managed to win 101 games following the departure of club-legend Freddie Freeman in the offseason. A big reason for Atlanta’s success is the emergence of rookies Michael Harris II and Spencer Strider. Harris has stepped up to become the starting center fielder, while Strider has carved out the number-two spot in the starting rotation after initially being used as a reliever. Although I love Oneil Cruz, the race is only between Harris and Strider. When the 2022 season began, most did not expect Harris to be promoted to the majors. Since being brought up in late May, Harris has been one of the league’s premier hitters and the most electric glove in center field. That is all the more unbelievable to consider when remembering Harris is only 21 years old and, until two years ago, was more of a pitcher than a position player. In only 114 games, Harris slashed .297/.339/.514 with 19 home runs, 64 RBIs, 20 stolen bases, and a 5.3-WAR season for Atlanta. Harris has made some of the most spectacular plays in center field that have required him to cover a lot of ground and put his body on the line, and he seems to come up big whenever he is called upon. Although Strider has been a huge piece of the Braves’ pitching staff with former top-prospect Ian Anderson’s disastrous season, Atlanta’s lineup would be nowhere without Harris. Harris has been, far and away, the best outfielder on the Braves this season. Ronald Acuña, Jr. has not returned to form after his injury, 2021 postseason heroes Eddie Rosario and Adam Duvall have struggled to stay healthy and consistent, and Marcell Ozuna has done a better job at being a terrible person than a good professional baseball player. Harris’s impact is greater than that of Strider’s, and Atlanta would have no chance of overcoming a 10.5-game NL East deficit to the Mets without him. You cannot go wrong with either of these rookie stars, but Michael Harris II is the better choice.
AL Manager of the Year (Pre-Season Pick: Charlie Montoyo — yikes)
End-of-year Selections:
 #1 BAL Brandon Hyde
 #2 HOU Dusty Baker
 #3 SEA Scott Servais
 #4 NYY Aaron Boone
 #5 CLE Terry Francona
The Orioles won 83 games this year — their most since 2016 — and surpassed their 2021 win total by 31 games. I am not a betting man, but the Orioles were only projected to win 62.5 games, so congratulations to those who took the over. This 20.5-game overperformance was the best mark in baseball. The 2019 Orioles had a 54-108 record in Brandon Hyde’s first season and somehow managed to record two fewer wins in 2021. Losing 100 games twice in the previous two full seasons (25-35 record in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season) ruffles a lot of feathers — it upsets fans, players, and often leads to front offices making impulse decisions that result in more setbacks. Luckily for the Orioles, they have their guy in Hyde. For those who know Hyde well, they knew the results would come eventually. Hyde is a great coach for young talent, but he also knows how to manage veterans. He is approachable and gives the players a voice in a lot of behind-the-scenes decisions. Maybe this is due in part to the fact he was a player once, too. While Hyde never made it to the majors as a player, he did play four seasons in the minor leagues as a backup catcher. You know what they say — unsuccessful catchers make the best managers!
NL Manager of the Year (Pre-Season Pick: Buck Showalter)
End-of-year Selections:
 #1 NYM Buck Showalter
 #2 PHI Rob Thomsom
 #3 ATL Brian Snitker
 #4 ARI Torey Lovullo
 #5 LAD Dave Roberts
The hiring of veteran manager Buck Showalter may be the league's top move of the offseason. The New York Mets ended 2021 with a 77-85 record and ended this year tied with the Atlanta Braves for the third-best record in the MLB (101-61). Yes, the Mets brought in Max Scherzer, Chris Bassitt, Starling Marte, and Mark Canha, to name a few, but the difference this year was the culture. The Mets were desperate for a manager with keen attention to detail, one who has the respect to shut down the egos of stars, and one with decades of expertise in answering to the media without causing drama. That is Buck Showalter. Buck was the catalyst for the Mets’ turnaround. He is a culture-changer and always has been, which is why he will take home his fourth Manager of the Year nod.
AL Comeback Player of the Year (Pre-Season Pick: Justin Verlander)
End-of-year Selections:
 #1 HOU Justin Verlander
 #2 LAA Mike Trout
On July 24, 2020, Justin Verlander “strained his right forearm” in what appeared to be an injury that would keep him from baseball activities for six weeks. It turns out Verlander’s elbow would require Tommy John Surgery, and he would miss practically all of the 2020 season and 2021 completely. For the then-37-year-old, it appeared to be a death sentence. But when one of your generation’s greatest players tells the world that he is confident “this surgery will ultimately lengthen my career as opposed to shorten it,” you listen. Hence, Verlander was my pre-season pick to win AL Comeback Player of the Year; yet, I did not expect him to be the 2022 AL Cy Young winner, too! No more needs to be said. This is his award.
NL Comeback Player of the Year (Pre-Season Pick: Ronald Acuña, Jr.)
End-of-year Selections:
 #1 Albert Pujols
 #2 Ronald Acuña, Jr.
After what, in my opinion, is the greatest 11-year prime of the modern era, Albert Pujols spent the last 10 years wasting away with the Angels and Dodgers (for half of a season) and spent all but two of his Octobers in Cancun not playing baseball. When Pujols signed a one-year, $2.5 million contract, he was to be nothing more than a part-time designated hitter against left-handed pitching and a veteran presence for young players. Three months into the season, Pujols was hitting .198 with four home runs. He strongly considered quitting then and there. Although Pujols’s career struggle with plantar fasciitis has physically limited him, he could never run from the grind. From then on, Pujols went on a tear. He hit .314, added 20 more homers, and drove in 51 runs. While doing this, Pujols eclipsed the 700-home run mark (now at 703), passed the universally beloved Álex Rodríguez to become fourth all-time in home runs, and even leapfrogged Babe Ruth in RBIs to finish second all-time (2,218). As a baseball fan, this was so fun for me to follow. And because his last regular season game was to be played at PNC Park on Wednesday, Oct. 5, naturally, I got tickets, but much to my chagrin, Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol did not play Pujols. And even though this is still not vintage Albert, he has been great. Maybe Pujols’s precipitous drop over the last ten years suggests that he is not to blame, and it was more the fault of the Los Angeles sunshine. In all seriousness, it is great to see one of history’s premier players succeed at the age of 42 in his final season. Hats off to Albert Pujols for a comeback almost as great as his illustrious career.

Buggy is a Carnegie Mellon tradition which has existed since 1920. The sport, which is practiced throughout the academic year, culminates in an annual series of relay races held on each year’s Raceday during Spring Carnival, in which teams vie for the title of “Champion.” The Buggy Rolls Report column reports on the buggies and roll counts for all of the teams which attend the freeroll practices (“rolls”) each weekend organized by the Carnegie Mellon Sweepstakes Committee. All of the information reported in the column is provided by the Carnegie Mellon Sweepstakes Committee.
After being rained out the weekend of Oct. 1-2, Carnegie Mellon buggy teams returned to the course this past weekend. Fortunately, the weather remained clear for both Saturday and Sunday this time around.
In total, seven teams rolled on Saturday, Oct. 8. In roll order, they were: Apex, SigEp (Sigma Phi Epsilon), SPIRIT, SigNu (Sigma Nu), PiKA (Pi Kappa Alpha), Fringe, and CIA (The Carnegie Involvement Association).
Apex rolled two buggies: Phoenix and Firefly. Phoenix got three rolls in while Firefly got one roll in.
SigEp rolled one buggy, Kraken, which got four rolls in.
SPIRIT rolled four buggies: Kingpin II, Seraph, Inviscid, and Mapambazuko (Zuke). Kingpin II, Inviscid, and Zuke all got four rolls in while Seraph got three rolls in.
SigNu rolled one buggy, Jager, which got one roll in.
PiKA rolled two buggies: Banshee and Raptor. Both buggies got three rolls in. 
Fringe rolled two buggies: Burnout and Blind Faith. Burnout got one roll in while Blind Faith got two rolls in.

CMU RESEARCH ROUNDUP
CMU creates office to support open-source projects
Over the summer, Carnegie Mellon established the Open Source Program Office (OSPO), which will support students in their contributions to open-source software. The office is funded by a $650,000 grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and will be under the University Libraries, which host open data and research services. Projects include supporting automatic science efforts at Carnegie Mellon's Cloud Lab and the Software Engineering Institute.
Modeling the growth of neurons
Carnegie Mellon researchers in the mechanical engineering department spent three years developing software to model the growth of neurons, now published in a paper in "Sci Rep." The team used a type of isogeometric analysis to break down the models into finite elements and alter the parameters of the model without recalculating the entire system. They also used phase field modeling to simulate continuous change in the model instead of having distinct phases of models. These methods were important as the team wanted to model all types of neuron growth patterns, which they found were difficult to achieve with methods such as the finite difference method. The team hopes that by improving models of neuron growth, they can make advances in studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. 
Customized disease treatment with nanoprint electrodes
The CMU Array is what Carnegie Mellon researchers are calling a 3D-printed high density microelectrode array (MEA) that could help customize disease treatment to the patient. In a paper in "Science Advances," they describe their MEA, which is a silicone-based field of pins that can be inserted into the brain to detect electrical discharge as part of a brain computer interface platform. Because it is 3D-printed, it can be easily changed based on the patient, and can also be three-dimensional to acquire more data. The team has filed for a patent on the CMU Array, and predict that it will take five years before human testing, and commercial use, their ultimate goal, will take even longer.
NATIONAL NEWS
Gas pipe leaks thousands of tons of methane, potentially deliberately
Natural gas pipes under the Baltic Sea leaked on Sept. 27 in what some suspect was a purposeful attempt to sabotage a country. Polish and Ukrainian leaders point fingers at the Russian government, while Russian state media point fingers at the U.S. or Ukraine. The leaks released about half the gas in one of the Nord Stream pipes running from Russia to Germany, amounting to several hundred thousands of tons of methane in the atmosphere. As of Oct. 3, the leaks have stopped. 
Danish and Swedish seismic networks, which usually detect earthquakes, found evidence of two powerful underwater blasts that went off in the area around the Nord Stream gas pipes before the leaks were detected. The explosions combined were the equivalent of 100 tons of dynamite, and experts find the seismic data to be similar to that produced by undersea mines or depth charges, weapons to destroy submarines. They suspect that these explosions broke the pipes and caused the leaks. It is also extremely difficult for these pipes, which are undersea and made with concrete-coated steel, to break on their own. 
This event also comes at a time when, due to Russia's war against Ukraine and sanctions against Russia in retaliation, gas is in shorter supply and prices have risen dramatically. Russia has slowly reduced the amount of gas flowing from Nord Stream 1 to the rest of Europe before halting it altogether at the end of August, citing economic pressure from Western sanctions. 
Other reasons people suspect the event could be for sabotage is the leaks are not too far underwater, making them dive-able, and are just 12 miles from nearby land, the Danish island of Bornholm. Some of the leaks are in Danish economic territory while another is in Swedish economic territory. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has acknowledged that the leaks could be deliberate, then added: "If it is confirmed, that's clearly in no one's interest." 
Other than the suspicions of sabotage, another cause for the concern is the immense amount of methane the leaks emitted, which scientists estimate to be 100,000 to 400,000 tons of methane. No matter what the true number is, it's still nearly guaranteed that it is the single largest methane emission event in history, releasing anywhere from two times to five times the amount of methane of the second largest methane event, the Aliso Canyon disaster. 
Unfortunately, this still isn't much compared to the total methane emitted by the fossil fuel industry, amounting to only a day or two of fossil fuel emissions. And though many talk about reducing their carbon footprint, methane is a much stronger contributor to global warming than carbon dioxide, absorbing 82.5 times more heat. This does not mean that the methane emissions from the Nord Stream leaks are small but rather puts into perspective how much methane fossil fuel companies produce.

This past week, the Nobel Prize committee named the winners of this year’s prestigious awards in sciences, literature, economics, and peace work. Six prizes are awarded, with some prizes going to multiple winners. A prize was announced each day this past week.
While the awards are named in October, the award ceremonies are to be held on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death. The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded in Stockholm, Sweden, while the other prizes are awarded in Oslo, Norway. 
Physiology or Medicine
The prize for physiology or medicine was the first to be awarded. Swedish geneticist Svante Pääbo claimed the prize “for his discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution.” He was the sole recipient of the prize.
Pääbo was able to sequence the genome of the Neanderthal, an extinct relative of present-day humans, and discovered a previously unknown hominin, Denisova. The gene transfer between now-extinct hominins to Homo sapiens following migration out of Africa approximately 70,000 years ago was an important discovery of Pääbo’s work. This underscores the physiological relevance of gene flow, like how our immune system reacts to infections.  
Physics
The prize for physics was shared between three men: Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser, and Anton Zeilinger for their work in quantum technology. Each man received a third of the prize “for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science.”
As technology develops, people are starting to find applications of quantum mechanics, including quantum computers, quantum networks, and secure quantum encrypted communication. One implication of quantum mechanics is “entanglement.” When two particles are in an “entangled pair,” actions to one particle also determine what happens to the other particle, even if they are far apart. 
In the 1960s, John Stewart Bell developed what is known as the Bell inequality. This states that if there are hidden variables in a system, then the correlation between the results of a large number of measurements will never exceed a certain value. Quantum mechanics, however, predicts this is not true; there is a certain type of experiment that should lead to a stronger correlation than would otherwise be possible. 
Clauser was the first to investigate this, designing a practical experiment to disprove Bell’s ideas. He was successfully able to take measurements that supported quantum mechanics’ violation of the Bell inequality. Essentially, this means quantum mechanics cannot be replaced with a theory that utilizes hidden variables. 
Aspect followed up on Clauser’s experiments to close some loopholes. In his experiments, Aspect was able to switch the measurement settings after an entangled pair had left its source, meaning the setting of the entangled pair did not affect the result. 
Zeilinger, using more refined tools and a long series of experiments, was able to use entangled states. His research group demonstrated that it is possible to perform “quantum teleportation,” which makes it possible to move a quantum state from one particle to another at a distance. 
Chemistry
The prize in chemistry was awarded to three scientists: Barry Sharpless, Morten Meldal, and Carolyn Bertozzi. Each was awarded a third of the prize “for the development of click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry.” 
The essence of click chemistry is making difficult processes easier. Sharpless and Meldal laid the foundation for a functional form of chemistry — known as click chemistry — in which molecular building blocks snap together quickly and efficiently. Bertozzi took the idea of click chemistry and utilized it in living organisms.
Sharpless, who previously won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2001, coined the concept of click chemistry around the year 2000. Click chemistry simplifies some processes in chemistry. The idea is that reactions occur quickly and unwanted by-products are avoided. 
Independently of each other, Meldal and Sharpless presented what is considered to be the crown jewel of click chemistry: “the copper catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition.” This is a chemical reaction that has widespread use and is utilized in the development of pharmaceuticals, mapping DNA, and creating materials that are more fit for purpose. 
Bertozzi took click chemistry and applied it to living organisms to map biomolecules that are on the surface of cells called “glycans.” The “bioorthogonal reactions” that she developed take place without disrupting the normal chemistry of the cell and are used to explore cells and track biological processes. 
Writing
The Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to French author Annie Ernaux “for the courage and clinical acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements, and collective restraints of personal memory.” She is noted for examining a life marked with strong disparities regarding gender, language, and class in her writings, both consistently and from different angles. 
Peace
The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to one individual and two organizations: human rights advocate Ales Bialiatski from Belarus, the Russian human rights organization Memorial, and the Ukrainian human rights organization Center for Civil Liberties.
Bialiatski was one of the initiators of the democracy movement in mid-1980s Belarus. He is noted for devoting his life to promoting democracy and peaceful development as well as founding the organization Viasna (Spring) in 1996 in response to controversial constitutional amendments that were passed. These amendments gave the president dictatorial powers and triggered widespread demonstrations. Bialiatski was imprisoned for his role in fighting for democracy from 2011 to 2014 and once again in 2020. He is still being detained without trial. 
Memorial was established in 1987 by human rights activists in the former Soviet Union who wanted to ensure the victims of the communist regime’s oppression would never be forgotten. Memorial’s mission is based on the belief that to prevent new crimes, we must confront past ones. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Memorial became the largest human rights organization in Russia. They established a center of documentation on victims of the Stalinist era and compiled information on political oppression and human rights violations in Russia. In December 2021, authorities decided Memorial was to be forcibly liquidated, and as a result, the documentation center was closed permanently. Despite this, the people behind Memorial refuse to be shut down. 
The Center for Civil Liberties was founded in Kyiv in 2007 for the purpose of advancing human rights and democracy in Ukraine. The Center took a stand to make Ukraine a full-fledged democracy and develop a state governed by law. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Center for Civil Liberties has engaged in efforts to identify and document Russian war crimes against the Ukrainian population and is playing a major role in attempting to hold guilty parties accountable for their crimes. 
The Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences will be announced on Oct. 10.

I need to be absolutely clear from the jump that this is not a joke or exaggeration. You're probably shocked since you've come to expect my usual scathing satire, but I need to lay aside the funnies for now and talk about "Trolls: World Tour" in the most earnest way I'm capable of doing. 
I'm not typically the type to watch kids movies, so I was reticent at first — my taste in media tends to be a bit more high-brow. But I watched this movie at my friend's insistence, and folks let me tell you, I could not have underestimated this movie more. 
The plot centers around six tribes of the titular Trolls, each of which bases their culture around a particular genre of music. There are the Pop, Funk, Classical, Hard Rock, Techno, and Country Trolls. Each group is largely ignorant of the other's existence, and each one possesses a magical string from which their musical powers derive. The inciting incident of our film is when the Hard Rock trolls begin their campaign to steal the strings of the other Trolls. Their leader, Queen Barb, wants to put all six magic strings on her guitar to play "the sickest power chord in history," to unite the world under hard rock. 
The main driving force of our plot is, effectively, a dictator attempting to create an ethnostate. This may seem like a leap, but let me elaborate. At the film's climax, we learn that her power chord turns you into a mindless zombie jamming out to hard-rock, which seems like a clear metaphor for the consequences of enforced homogeneity. When cultural norms are strictly enforced, you necessarily rob people of their individuality and agency. 
If you want more proof, there's a moment where we see a map of Queen Barb's plan for Troll-world domination, and I'll be damned if their bat-skull insignia doesn't look like the Nazi flag. Furthermore, her tactics for conquest appear to revolve around the use of extremely fast and destructive mechanized warfare, which very strongly resembles the German blitzkrieg. So I think it's fair to say that Queen Barb is fascism-coded.
However, this analysis only takes us so far, as the movie's commentary on the subject of fascism and conquest amounts to little more than, "those things are pretty bad." Not too subversive of a message for a kids movie. Now we can start peeling back the additional layers of nuance to this film. 
The primary message of this film is about multiculturalism, but the film delivers this in a surprisingly smart way. The ideological climax occurs during the musical number, "It's All Love," in which the Funk Trolls explain to Queen Poppy the real reason the trolls live separately; in the distant past, the Pop Trolls tried to enforce Pop-music hegemony, and in a desperate bid to preserve their culture the leader of each genre stole their own string and fled. 
One interpretation of this scene is that it's an allegory for imperialism. Earlier in the film, Queen Poppy had been taught a whitewashed version of history by her father that blinded to the musical oppression her ancestors wrought upon the Troll world. This causes her to re-evaluate her moral code which had been guiding her own ideology, a clear metaphor for how we all need to re-evaluate the colonial attitudes that define our perception of politics and culture. 
Another important ideological message during this scene occurs when the protagonists are reunited with their friend, Cooper. Cooper is a Funk troll that lives among the Pop trolls, having been displaced by an unfortunate accident while he was an infant. He is accepted into the Pop trolls society and appears to be some sort of consort or advisor to the throne (his exact political role is unclear). Cooper lives well, but when he learns there may be trolls out there that look like him, he ventures out to find his kin. Just when things look hopeless, he is picked up by the Vibe City spaceship, where he encounters a whole society of Trolls that look just like him. He learns that he is the long-lost heir to the Vibe Throne and is embraced back into his own culture. One interpretations is that this is an allegory for the experiences of non-white people in majority white communities. Even if the people are as nice as can be, you still need a connection to your own culture to fully realize your own identity. It's a very effective way of breaking down this complex issue into something easy for kids to understand. 
An important sub-plot involves four teams of bounty hunters commissioned by Queen Barb to search for Queen Poppy. The exact genealogical connections between the various troll ethnic groups is never fully explained, but it's implied that our four bounty hunter groups — Kpop, Reggaeton, Jazz, and Yodeling — live on the periphery of our main Troll kingdoms without a nation-state of their own. In the film, the Kpop and Reggaeton Trolls find one of our protagonists at the same time, and they dance-battle to decide who gets to keep him. Our protagonist then asks them, "Why should Queen Barb be allowed to decide which music gets to exist?" This is obviously an allegory for how empires exert power by fostering inter-ethnic divisions. The European colonial empires would often promise resources and privileges to certain ethnic groups in exchange for assistance in subjugating other groups. Much of the time, they did this to extend their influence into territory far beyond what they directly administered, and in many cases is the origin of ongoing civil conflicts. This is yet another extremely complicated part of modern history that "Trolls: World Tour" makes accessible to kids in a way that doesn't overly simplify the concept.
Now there are certainly some problematic elements to the film as well. For example, Queen Barb (Troll Hitler) gets a redemption arc which has some troubling moral messages about the way we should treat war criminals. It might have been better if they added a post-credits scene of a Troll-Nuremberg Trial. Furthermore, the only form of government we see in this film is hereditary monarchy, and the text strongly implies that giving absolute power into a single autocrat is acceptable as long as they're a good person. I suppose this is excusable on the grounds of narrative simplicity, as it makes more sense to have just one character represent a culture. It would be rather confusing for Vibe City to have a decentralized anarcho-municipalist political structure governed by a quorum of community leaders. There's only so much decolonialist leftist theory they can reasonably fit into a kids movie.
All in all, this movie is pretty based. Once you get past the two separate characters voiced by James Corden and the schlocky dialogue, it's a pretty worthwhile watch. At least watch it high or something, it's a fun one.

Dear Cassandra, 
The trees stopped being green out of absolutely nowhere.
I started remembering how it felt to be grateful for this place, and all it is. There are so many more students here than you would think, than you would ever know. We are in college. It’s kind of wonderful to conceptualize, if you really really try. If you need help, go up to the ninth floor of Gates and look out of any of the windows, but especially the ones in the conference room in the very corner of the floor. It's spectacular up there.
I went up there with Henry to study on Wednesday night, and we inhabited it for 5 or 6 hours, the way you only can with conference rooms at night. The things that make them useful as conference rooms during the day all of a sudden seem so useless, and actually annoying. Like, what the hell is this podium doing here? This is my study room?! Anyways, I’ve been studying with Henry pretty often recently because it is the best excuse to spend time with someone, especially when you actually really need to be studying instead of spending time with them. I’ve been learning that he does not talk while he studies, ever. Not to tell me about an interesting problem he’s working on, or to rehash a memory from the day, not at all. This means that I also do not talk, because it seems so disrespectful to break a silence like that. In fact, on Wednesday night, I didn’t talk for so long that I actually fell asleep, right there in front of my computer, rather than ask him if he wanted to leave. It was probably around one in the morning. I woke up Thursday morning in the same chair, with Henry’s sweatshirt spread out on top of me. During the time in which my brain was rebuilding the story of the night before, I was convinced that I was alone. It was not until I came to the conclusion that I had slept in an academic building and needed to get out and go home as quickly as possible and proceeded to stand up so as to do that very thing that I saw Henry’s things still on the table, and Henry himself spread out on the floor, using his backpack as a pillow.
He’s really beautiful, Cassandra. He has dimples, and not only when he smiles, but all the time. It’s like he has this incredibly sober face and then there are the dimples and you just don’t know what to do with them. It’s like euphoria.
Anyways, I learned that you can’t really recover a day once it’s been started in a conference room in Gates, even if the morning view out of the windows of that conference room is even more stunning than the view at night. So Thursday was a little bit of a mess, but luckily, I didn’t have much going on, so it was fine. I spent a lot of the afternoon in my dorm, which was lucky, because someone knocked on my door at one point. This doesn’t happen very often.
It was Miles, which, taken alone, is probably the most insane thing I could have just told you. The thing is, though, that he wasn’t alone. He was with Monica. I had literally just texted Monica to ask her something about one of our studio classes, and I feel like she would have mentioned being in the building if she was here. Also, she doesn’t know Miles, at least not to my knowledge. Also, she lives in the Tri Delt house.
And Miles doesn’t live here either, you know I would have told you if he did. He lived here last year. In fact, I haven’t seen him or talked to him since the time that he lived here. I actually try to think about him and what happened last semester as little as possible, even though I actually think about it all the time. I think I will be 36 years old and I will still be thinking about it. 
“Do you have a pair of scissors?”
That’s what he had come to ask me. When I asked him what he was doing in Gardens, he just repeated the question again. He needed scissors. I went back into my room and got the scissors and handed them to him. He and Monica turned on their heels and walked down the hallway, away from my door. Monica didn’t even acknowledge me. 
On Friday morning, I found the scissors on my floor, having been slid under my door, back into my room. I’m at the point where I want to do something about all of this, but I don’t even know who I would begin to talk to or what I would tell them. Besides you, I suppose.
Thanks for listening.
Love,
Maggie

(Disclaimer: Spoilers, naturally.) 
Mary Harron’s “American Psycho” is one of those films which has come back into society’s mind in recent years. I find the film has a socially relevant message about American consumerism and elitist hypocrisy. The film touches upon our contemporary idea of masculinity, showing us how it has been rotted and twisted from high gallantry to the plague. Today, masculinity is perceived as shallow and aggressive.
In our society, everyone is copy-paste. Everyone has become a façade. Everyday, we apply on ourselves a mask to wear throughout the day. When we go home, out of the castigating sight of the world, we shed these personas, and sink into our rooms as shriveled husks, unhappy with our lives and states of being — unhappy with the world we find ourselves in. We convince ourselves it is useless to contribute to a useless world, so we drown ourselves in empty pleasure in order to suppress these daily burdens. Within the context of these realities, we find comfort in “American Psycho,” a cautionary tale of where the world is headed if we continue down this road. 
In the opening of the film, when we first meet Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) and his colleagues, we witness the superficiality of his relationships with the people around him. The dialogue between the men is unnatural, as if they aren’t human. None of them are actually conversing with one another. They are talking, but no one is saying anything of worth. If not on the topic of money, it’s lunch and dinner reservations. If not that, it’s misogynistic or hateful remarks. They all dress the same, talk the same, and live in their little bubble of total narcissism. These people we consider the "elite" are the products of the great American temple of materialism. They come from a long line of elitist, Ivy League-educated Wall-Streeters, who hardly hesitate to voice disdain for the working class, yet who themselves contribute nothing more than hollow criticisms of a system they are fundamentally disconnected from.
Hypocritical speech flows from elites' snake tongues without any true remorse for the people that they exploit. This is evidenced by a restaurant scene in which Patrick delivers a lengthy address towards his fiancée Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon) and their “friends” about how it’s up to the elite class to better the world. He claims to stand for equality for women and minorities, a sentiment undercut by his malicious behaviors towards these groups throughout the film. He claims to hold traditional values, yet bastardizes them on regularly with the numerous affairs he has with his colleagues' wives, with prostitutes, with any woman he can get his hands on. Meanwhile, he remains oblivious to Evelyn's own affair with his associate.
Now, I do not believe that characters in films are based imagination alone. I believe that all characters are in some way grounded in reality and are based upon the people they represent in real life, otherwise they’d be unbelievable. It is true that it’s the politicians and socialites, the ones who talk most about social issues, who most violate the rules they claim to support. We see it in our politicians, our executives, our celebrities and our influencers. We hear them lie through their teeth for the slightest shred of power, or wealth, or fame. We feel the alienation and discord they sow as subterfuge for their own selfish intents. They are not heroes of justice. They are not the force which will end all oppression. The powerful are not the cure for the world’s ailments but rather the disease itself. As with treatment rather than a cure, when people depend on elites they opt out of individual agency. These people wish to be worshipped and do not hesitate to espouse sweet words that sink into the minds of common people. We regurgitate what we hear and spread this corrupting and catastrophic sensationalism, all for the elites bottomless greed. Sometimes the powerful's actions surface, and we get cases like Harvey Weinstein in Hollywood, Jeffrey Epstein in business boardrooms, and Andrew Cuomo in state leadership roles. Everyone within these monsters' circles knows of their actions. I hold no doubt that there are politicians and business executives who are still committing these terrible actions today, despite what any of them say. With infinite amounts of money to buy people’s silence and an army of lawyers to quash all outspoken victims, they are capable of always getting their way. 
It’s no wonder so many people take refuge in stories that call out the world of these monsters, whether it is “American Psycho” or otherwise. It’s because they are willing to sing us a different tune than what we hear all day, seven days a week. It shows us how our world got to what it is today. Why have men become increasingly hostile toward women? Why do men increasingly treat women with such little respect? Why are more women opposing the masculinity of today? These questions have come about because of the ideas that the elite class superimposed upon American culture. “American Psycho” manages to tell this story without shying away from the ruling class's brutal lifestyle and mentally disturbed state. 
Because of its obscene and ultra-violent content, "American Psycho" was considered “unadaptable” for the screen by some. Compared to the book, the film definitely cuts down on graphic content, but still gets the point across. There are scenes of pornographic violence and sexual splatter which are difficult to watch, but they convey the degeneracy in which these people love to baptize themselves. They are desensitized to violence — they work out while watching violent movies. They take phone calls and relax by consuming pornographic material. This is a mirror of society today.  “American Psycho” shows how our culture has been contaminated with what was considered morally reprehensible 40 or 50 years ago — these actions are now seen as neutral or even acceptable. 
But it has gotten worse and continues to worsen daily. 
It is ironic that "American Psycho" shows how desensitized we are to violent and sexual content by forcing displeasure onto viewers' minds with brutal depictions. It is not pleasant to witness these things. It makes us question ourselves; seeing these things shakes sense into us by forcing us to recognize that we live in a world where such things are allowed. It calls upon us to examine society to see how so many people are okay with (or even support) the degenerate and immoral behaviors that are pushed upon us. 
By the end of “American Psycho,” we feel unreal. The film talks not of the face that we put on, but rather the true faces we hid under that. It shows that we have become abstractions of ideas, unrecognizable from anyone else due to us all being the same people. Like Bateman applying a thousand products to look inhumanly perfect, we also cover our blemishes and flaws. We suppress our desires until there is no need to have the mask on any longer, and in a fit of rage or lust, we take out these bottled-up desires on the people around us. 
Is this the world we really want to live in? Do we want to live not as people, but as robots? Everything is so broken out of proportion with morality, it makes it difficult for us to care for goodness and responsibility and reason within humanity. If we can secure a better world again, we must rid ourselves of the culture that pressures us into a lifestyle of harm and hedonism. Rid yourself of the slogans of organizations. Look to better yourself. Seek to have your own opinions rather than those planted within your mind. Doing such, you will be a much more complete and satisfied person. 
I understand that this analysis has been very dark and dismal. I apologize for that. But with such art, dealing with topics of morality, pleasure, and especially the feeling of insignificance in the world, I believe that it is necessary to think about the bigger picture. Think for a moment about the birds and the fish and the squirrels. They wake up early in the morning to get their days started, not knowing what will ensue, or whether it will be their last day. But they do not cower or hide in fear. They get on with their days because they must keep going — not for pleasure, but to live. They love life. So why should you stay in bed and let life be chalked up to immediate pleasure? Simply put, do not let the good years pass you by. 
Thanks a million. 
TL;DR, “American Psycho” is an influential film because it exposes the hypocritical culture of the elite and how the masses have been led to follow elitist rhetoric. “American Psycho” really shows the degradation of society’s values and how masculinity has been twisted beyond comprehension. It’s really a film that makes you question your place in the world. 8.00/10.

This article was written by two authors. You can differentiate their writing by font. Cole's writing is bold; Haley's is regular
I was sitting in my room doing homework with a friend when I heard the song “Waterfall” by Fish in a Birdcage for the first time. I immediately added it to many of my playlists, and I recently had the pleasure of listening to the rest of their discography, and it’s safe to say that the album “Waterfall” is an absurdly good album. As such, I proceeded to share it with all my friends, including the co-writer of this article. 
“Rule #13 - Waterfall:”
This is the type of song that I’d want to listen to in a sensory deprivation tank. It really makes me feel like that scene in “Ratatouille” where Remy is eating the strawberry and the cheese at the same time and there’s little pops and splashes of color across the screen. I can feel the slow build through the chorus expanding inside of my chest. It’s so good.
“Waterfall” is one of the strongest starts to an album I’ve ever heard. It sets the tone of how great the album is, which is no easy feat. The song is so distracting in the best way and it is genuinely so hard not to sing along to. The instrumentals and vocals are so good I don’t even know how to accurately describe them without downplaying how good it is. 
“Rule #14 - Fiddler’s Heart:”
This song is so sweet and nice. Do you know that video that keeps going around TikTok with a different song on it every time? The one with the guy dancing on the boardwalk as the camera like, spins around him? That’s what this song makes me want to do. They are not lying about the Fiddler in this song, that man put his whole ass (and heart) into it. I AM listening to that Fiddler’s Heart.
One of the things I like about this album is how different every song is. “Fiddler’s Heart” is so different from “Waterfall” but it slaps just as hard somehow?? It’s such a light-hearted song that just makes me happy. The imagery is just so sweet and the lyrics line up perfectly with the emotions that the song conveys. 
“Rule #15 - Four Aces:”
AAAAAHAHHHHHHHH THIS SONG!!! She sounds a little darker than a lot of the songs from this album, but Holy God and Jesus, it is so so good. It makes me want to commit heinous acts. “THAT SON OF A BITCH” makes me want to fold myself in half and just shriek like a banshee, swear to God it calls something out of me that needs to be released. It’s just supercharging me until I feel like I’m gonna burst at the seams. 
The heavy demeanor of this song is so good, and like Haley said, “THAT SON OF A BITCH” makes me feral every time I hear it. It’s such a great part of a really, really good song. The best way to describe this song is you’re swallowing gravel to satisfy an itch in your stomach, and it works soooo well.
Side note from Haley: Swallowing gravel is so absolutely correct and Cole SHOULD say it.
“Rule #16 - Movies:”
At first I wasn’t super crazy about this song, but it has grown on me so much. This is the soundtrack for that part of the rom-com where the main characters have finally gotten together and now you just get to watch a sweet little silly montage of them being happy and goofy as a couple. The guitar is so nice. I imagine this song is what it feels like to be a tree swaying in a cool breeze on a warm day.
I’m such a sucker for this song; it just feels so sweet to me. It truly does feel like something you would hear in a rom-com because that’s the exact vibe it gives. The little bridge in the middle of the song  is the part of the story where you cut between the couple having a picnic, going to the mall, and doing cute couple stuff. It conveys so much emotion and I imagine the song would finish on the couple watching the sunset together on a boardwalk.
“Rule #17 - Two Sides:”
PLEEAASSEE I LOVE THIS SONG. It’s so bittersweet, this couple obviously loves each other so much but they’re both just doing a terrible job communicating and dealing with each other. It makes my heart ache but like… in a fun smooth jazzy way. This has a funky little keyboard moment in the middle that makes me want to be in a speakeasy or something. I’d say this is the song off this album that gets stuck in my head most often, and I’m not even upset about it.
**If I was a sucker for “Movies,” then I’m a real sucker for “Two Sides.” I love duets where the two voices tell the same story from different sides. It’s such a good song about how two people don’t know how to make it work but are so happy with each other and want to work. The range of emotions — from frustration to tiredness to love — makes it a heavier song, but it’s so fun at the same time. **
“Rule #18 - Lion:”
OH YEAH this is the shit. This song makes me fade in and out of existence like someone dropped me into photoshop and is rapidly oscillating my opacity back and forth from zero to 100.  The keys on this once again slap, and there’s such a sexy little latin vibe going on. The cowbell comes in and makes me want to sharpen my teeth and just gnash them like I’m where the wild things are. 
“Lion” is one of the songs I always forget the name of but immediately recognize as soon as it comes on. It’s so smooth and once again feels so different from anything else on the album but it’s so, so good. The best way to describe the song is that I simply want it to eat me whole.
“Rule #19 - Amigo:”
First and foremost: this is the best song on the album. This song makes me feral. You thought I was a freak for the way I described the other songs? Too bad. The vocals. The instruments. The bassline behind the scatting. Oh my God. The way I most commonly describe this song is that it makes me vibrate at my resonant frequency. One day I will find a way to play Amigo loud enough in my headphones that it burrows into my brain, and I will start vibrating so hard that I levitate off the ground and then shatter into a million little pieces. And I will die happy.
“Amigo” is so funky in the right way and just reminds me of having a great time with friends. It jams in the right way and I love the little swing in the vocals. The lines “If I could do the math/That’s a lot of beer!” in unison stick out so well. The only thing I want from this song is for it to be longer.
“Rule #20 - Blessed by a Curse:”
This song  is nice but like. I don’t really have much to say about it. It’s fine, but compared to the other songs on this album it just doesn’t hit, ya know? It’s whatever.
“Blessed by a Curse” is a bit of a weak spot on the album, but it is so incredibly far from bad. It’s a bit of a darker vibe than the rest of the album, but I like the progression of the song a lot. Some of the background effects later in the song are really good, so still consider me a fan.
“Rule #21 - Memento Mori:”
HOOOOLY SHIT this bangs. This one scratches the brain so well. The strings are so perfect. I want to swallow an orchestra whole and let them play from within me. I want this song to play in the background of an unhinged crime spree where I’ve finally abandoned the last of society’s expectations and decided to pursue my ambitions regardless of potential consequences. I never wanted to sleep.
This is undoubtedly my favorite song on the album. The shift from the opening to the start of the vocal just hits so hard that it simply makes me want to do a keyboard smash every time I hear it. It’s funky in such a good way and just occupies my mind constantly. “Memento Mori” makes me want to just go out into the woods and roll around on the ground and not return for a week in a very good way.
“Rule #22 - If Trees Could Talk:”
This song is so nice. It feels just like climbing trees with my brothers in early autumn. The guitar is so perfect. I love it so dearly. The violin is so nice. It has such ambiance. It’s like being a little leaf drifting sweetly down a little stream. I really really like this one. 
“If Trees Could Talk” is just such a pleasant song with really good vocals. There’s nothing I would change; it just feels perfect. I imagine this would play in a coming of age movie when someone is looking back on everything that has happened to them the past few months and it just feels comfy.

I've never been to an AB concert before, but I enjoyed Peach Tree Rascals this Saturday. It wasn't overwhelming, and I don't think anybody screamed their throat out, but it was nice. I liked the way they engaged with the audience, like how Tarrek tried on heart-shaped glasses from an audience-member, and also Isaac's floppy ears on his beanie. I really liked his floppy ears.
I will admit, I haven't listened to them much, if at all, outside of the one time I streamed their songs after hearing they would perform at Carnegie Mellon. I liked the vibes for sure, though as indie music it definitely would moreso go on my study playlist. But when I listened to them in person, with speakers blaring and spinning multi-colored lights, it definitely brought a new listening experience. 
As for the concert itself, it wasn't filled to the brim with people by any means, but those there seemed to at least be more avid listeners of Peach Tree Rascals than I was. It opened with a student DJ, who played common pop songs, and Peach Tree Rascals themselves didn't start their performance until around 8:30 p.m. As we waited for them to come on stage, someone or a group of someones began to start a chant of "PTR! PTR!" that died out after half a minute. We shuffled awkwardly for a couple more minutes until the guitarist, drummer, and backup vocalist came on stage as cheers erupted. Then the cheering heightened when vocalists and rappers Isaac and Tarrek came on stage, who then explained that a member, Joseph, couldn't make it that day since it was his father's 70th birthday. Joseph is the vocalist who sings the hook of "Mariposa," a song that brought them to fame on TikTok. 
The rest of the concert I think was pretty standard, with the occasional phone break and some audience interaction. Of the songs, I think I liked "Good Advice" and "I'm Sorry" the most, which were some of the slower songs they performed. They also gave a sneak peak of a yet-to-be-released song that I forgot the name of, but I also remember really liking the drum beat in that one, which accelerated for some bits and would then promptly drop off. At some point Tarrek I think splashed water on the audience before launching into "Mariposa," the last song of the night, and a few drops got onto my face, which I wasn't sure how I felt about. 
But otherwise, I enjoyed their energy and the vibes. After the concert, I definitely walked away interested in learning more about the group and listening to more of their songs.

Carnegie Mellon's Institutional Master Plan (IMP) is currently undergoing final rounds of approval by the Pittsburgh City Council, and in a few weeks' time, will likely be approved. The IMP is a document that large landowning institutions are required to submit to the city every 10 years that outlines all projects they intend to complete within the next decade, and Carnegie Mellon’s master plan has been years in the making. The Tartan spoke with Bob Reppe, the University Architect, and Jennifer Beck, the Project Manager, to learn about the plan (a summary of the IMP is available online).
The IMP, as Reppe describes it, is a "bit of a wish list." Since the University is not bound to follow through on all the items, Reppe calls it, "a projection of where we think the university will be in the next 10 years." Carnegie Mellon is currently zoned as an EMI​​ (Educational and Medical Institution), a special designation given to universities and hospitals within Pittsburgh. The IMP is the means by which the city can keep track of what large institutions are doing on their land.  The IMP contains plans for new buildings, new infrastructure to integrate Carnegie Mellon with adjacent communities, and revitalizing existing public spaces on campus. Highlights from the list of proposed developments include: 
 - Up to three new mixed-use buildings (including possible new dorms, dining, offices, and classrooms) at the current site of Donner House and the Donner ditch
 - A new mixed-use building on what is currently a parking lot behind Morewood Gardens
 - A new engineering building between Scott Hall and Robert Mehrabian Collaborative Institute
 - Replacing Cyert Hall and Warner Hall with a new administrative building 
 - Rebuilding the Greek Quad with denser housing
 - A new science building at the site of Carnegie lots (the southeast corner of Forbes and Craig). Construction on this building is scheduled to begin in 2023 thanks to a recent 75 million dollar grant from the Richard King Mellon foundation
In addition to new academic buildings and student housing, the IMP describes a "mobility plan," which includes:
 - Widening the sidewalks, improving pedestrian crossings, and creating public seating on Craig Street
 - Constructing a bridge across Junction Hollow between Scott Hall and the proposed new science building at Carnegie Lots
 - Straightening the intersection, building a bus shelter, and establishing bike-only lanes at Morewood Avenue and Fifth Avenue
 - Improving the connection between Schenley Park and campus
 - A walkway on the west side of the tennis courts to directly connect the CUC and CFA building
 - Widening the Forbes Ave bridge over Junction Hollow to accommodate wider sidewalks and bike-only lanes
The initial stages of the plan began in May of 2020, and was followed by an extended period of community outreach. According to Reppe, the IMP project team held over 100 meetings with stakeholders, including Carnegie Mellon students, neighboring communities, and city government departments. By fall of 2021, the team began to create the final document, and Reppe expects the final vote from city council to take place within three to five weeks. 
There are a number of posters around campus announcing an application to rezone certain parcels of land for the IMP. While the public hearing occurred more than a month ago, it's important to go over what this rezoning actually describes. Currently, several student housing units are zoned as standard residential plots, including Fifth Neville Apartments, Clyde House and Highland Apartments. The university is proposing to change these to EMI to be consistent with the rest of the University. 
One of the major themes of the 2022 IMP is densifying the existing campus, and creating better pedestrian-oriented infrastructure. One of their goals was to ensure there is no net increase in parking — all new parking spaces have to be integrated into existing buildings and parking structures (this is in accordance with a non-binding recommendation from the City of Pittsburgh).
When asked how many of the new items are likely to be built, Reppe responded, "We will never get to everything in the master plan in the next 10 years." By nature, the IMP tends to be an aspirational document, since it represents the upper limit of how much the university would be allowed to expand in the next decade. According to Reppe, even though "the deans of all three science schools" want the bridge over Junction Hollow, it's still arguably one of the most ambitious elements of the plan and is by no means a guarantee.
When asked to describe their favorite parts of the new plan, Beck emphasized its "focus on the public realm," and how it will develop "the spaces between the buildings that everyone experiences." Reppe emphasized how the plan focuses on developing the "campus edges," including the connection with Schenley Park and the Craig Street neighborhood.

When family members told Rashod Xavier Brown that they did not plan to vote because neither candidate impressed them, Brown said he refused to let that fly. At a rally on Saturday, Oct. 8, he told a crowd of 200 people that voting is more than a personal decision. “That is not only your life that you don’t care about. That is my life,” said Brown, a trans man who serves as the Community Health Specialist at TransYOUniting. “If you love me, then you will go out and vote. I don’t know about you but I love me, and I love you too, so … vote.” 
The Pittsburgh Women’s March chapter organized the rally outside the City-County Building. Speakers encouraged people to mobilize for the upcoming midterm elections and warned against increasing attacks against feminism. 
Michelle McFall, who chairs the Westmoreland Democratic Committee, told protesters about threats facing Democrats in her region. On Sept. 8, chunks of a sign for gubernatorial candidate Josh Shapiro were slashed out of its four by eight foot frame. A week later, a gunman walked into a local Dairy Queen intending to “kill Democrats and liberals,” according to CBS News. 
“It's hard to be a Democrat in counties like mine,” McFall said. Democrats represent 39 percent of registered voters in Westmoreland County, according to data from the Pennsylvania Department of State. “It’s hard to knock doors. It’s hard to do the work. But we do it anyway. Because we know what’s at stake. … Do not sit this one out.” She told protesters that Republican candidates’ extremist rhetoric was not enough to assume their Democratic challengers would slide into an easy win. “We can’t count on just Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. We got to count on everyone in between — every county, every vote.”
This sentiment was emphasized throughout the rally. Tracy Baton, one of the march’s organizers who described Pittsburgh as “a human rights town,” gave protesters clear directions. “Your homework is to go home and call ten friends. Go have ten difficult conversations,” she said. Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey and congressional candidate Summer Lee (D-12) also encouraged people to pick up the phone to encourage family, friends and acquaintances to vote. 
“We cannot afford to ever again be asleep at the wheel,” Lee said of political activism. “There are people who are on the fence, who are waiting for you to come knock on their door to tell them what’s at stake.” 
Gainey agreed. “I don’t want to go backwards,” he said at the rally. “I don’t want our children growing up in a society that devalues who they are, as a person, by telling them they don’t have a right to vote, that they can’t love who they love, that they can’t do what they feel they want to do for their rights.”
Among the messages scrawled onto posters were: “Forced birth is not pro-life,” “I believed Christine Blasey Ford, too,” and “My favorite season is the fall of the patriarchy.” Many people carried signs for Democratic senate candidate John Fetterman. One of the men who attended the rally — which was largely populated by women — held a sign that read, “Real men support women’s rights.”
Obstetrics and gynecology physician Yasaswi Kislovsiky shared “poem in praise of menstruation” by Lucille Clifton. Laura Horowitz — who works with the Women’s Law Project to protect abortion access — also spoke at the march, alongside TransYOUniting founder and executive director Dena Stanley; gun safety activist Dana Kellerman; Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations executive director Jam Hammond; 1Hood Media policy and advocacy director Miracle Jones; and Pittsburgh Democratic Committee chair Leeann Younger.
Maryam Saeedi, an assistant professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon, spoke about the feminist protests sweeping through Iran since the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody. Amini was arrested when Iran’s morality police said she did not meet hijab protocol. 
“I am not talking about Margaret Atwood’s next novel; this happens every day in Iran,” Saeedi said of misogynistic oppression in Iran. “Believe in Gilead,” because it already exists in Iran, she told the crowd. 
Summer Lee urged protesters to channel their energy locally. “If we stand together with our sisters in Iran, let’s make sure we also stand in solidarity with our sisters right here,” she said. “Oppression against women is not a foreign concept.”

The 2022 midterm elections are happening this Nov. 8, and the deadline to register to vote is Oct. 24. If you are a Carnegie Mellon student, you can vote in this election as long as you are over 18, a U.S. citizen, and have resided in Pennsylvania for at least 30 days prior to the election.
If you live on campus, your mailing address places you in ward 14 and district 7 of Allegheny County. Election districts are very small, so if you live off campus, you are likely in a different district. You can find your election ward, district, and polling location using an online tool made by the Pennsylvania government. (Note: the text box for street names is extremely laggy. Type in the first letter of your street and wait 5-10 seconds.) For on-campus residents, your polling location will be in the Cohon University Center.  
U.S. Senate Race: 
The first race on the ballot is for our U.S. Senator. The winner will replace Republican Pat Toomey, who is stepping down after holding the position since 2011. There are 35 Senate seats up for grabs this midterm (21 Republican and 14 Democrat). The Democratic nominee is Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman. Key campaign positions include legalizing marijuana, protecting the "union way of life," codifying abortion rights, and ensuring universal healthcare coverage. The Republican nominee is Mehmet Oz, a heart surgeon and former host of "The Dr. Oz Show." Key campaign issues include reducing regulations on the fossil fuel industry, establishing voter ID laws, and fighting illegal immigration. He also claims to be "100% pro-life." 
PA Governor's Race:
The second race on the ballot is for governor and lieutenant governor, who run together on a single ticket. The gubernatorial winner will replace Democrat Tom Wolf, who has reached his term limit, having held the position since 2015. The Democratic nominee for governor is current Attorney General Josh Shapiro; the nominee for lieutenant governor is Austin Davis, who represents the 35th district in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. Key campaign issues include protecting abortion rights, protecting voting rights, banning discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals, and banning youth conversion therapy. The Republican nominee for governor is Doug Mastriano, who currently represents the 33rd district in Pennsylvania's State Senate; the nominee for lieutenant governor is Carrie DelRosso, who represents the 33rd district in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. Their campaign issues include criminalizing abortion, banning the teaching of critical race theory in public schools (which is not taught in public schools), and strengthening penalties for violent crime. 
To learn more, read our coverage of the governor's race from the Sept. 19 edition of The Tartan. 
US House (PA-12):
The third race is for the U.S. House of Representatives. Carnegie Mellon (and much of Pittsburgh) is located in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, but prior to this year's redistricting was located in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, represented by Democrat Michael Doyle. (Pennsylvania lost a seat in the U.S. House and now only has 17 representatives.) The Democratic nominee is Summer Lee, who currently represents the 34th district in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. Key campaign issues include raising the minimum wage to $15/hour, universal pre-k and childcare, creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and Medicare-for-All. The Republican nominee is Michael Doyle, not to be confused with the aforementioned current House representative for Pennsylvania's 18th district, Michael Doyle. To clarify, there are two separate men named Michael Doyle. The Democrat Michael Doyle has represented Pittsburgh in Congress for 28 years and is retiring at the end of his current term. The Republican Michael Doyle is a businessman and Councilman in Plum Borough. Key campaign issues for Doyle include securing the border, "energy independence," and "election integrity."
State General Assembly Race: 
The fourth race is for our representative in the State House of Representatives. Democrat Dan Frankel, who has represented Pennsylvania's 18th State House District since 1999, is running for re-election. There is no republican nominee for this position, which now represents the 12th district following the change in congressional maps. His only opponent is environmental activist Jay Ting Walker of the Green party. 
Ballot Initiative:
Currently, County Council members are required to resign from their position before seeking another office. A proposed ballot initiative would remove this requirement, giving County Council members the ability to run for office while still holding their seat on the council. The 13-member County Council is the chief legislative body for Allegheny County, and council members are appointed positions (Carnegie Mellon is located in County District 11, represented by Paul Klein). It is important to note that this restriction does not apply to the Chief Executive of the Council nor any other county officials position. The county argues that this policy "serves no meaningful purpose," and that the "same provisions" should apply to the Chief Executive and Council members. 
Note: In an earlier version of this article, it was incorrectly reported that Dan Frankel does not have a campaign website. His website can be found at electdanfrankel.com.

On Oct. 6, the Undergraduate Student Senate held their weekly general body meeting. The two major items on the agenda were an academic calendar assessment presentation and a student and faculty ombuds presentation. 
The academic calendar assessment presentation was given by computer science teaching professor Mark Stehlik, who serves on the Calendar Innovation Committee (CIC). The CIC was created to analyze the Academic Year (AY) 21-22 calendar and assess what should be done for AY 22-23. The result was the current “7-1-7 alignment” that features seven weeks of classes, one week of break, and seven weeks of classes. The main purpose of the AY 22-23 Calendar Assessment Committee (CAC), a part of the CIC, is to “develop and deliver a set of recommendations to the Provost for evaluating the impact of the approved changes to the academic calendar that can inform decision-making about the future of the academic calendar.”
The CAC has approached their work through five meetings: the first for developing research questions, the second through fourth to research question themes, and the fifth to prioritize metrics. Currently, 37 metrics within four domains have been considered to assess the new 7-1-7 calendar: 12 for student learning and curriculum, 15 for student wellbeing, five for faculty and staff experience, and five for faculty and staff wellbeing.
Three criteria were used to evaluate each metric: communication power, which considers how well a question communicates to a broad and diverse audience; proxy power, which asks how well the question says something of critical importance about the 7-1-7 calendar change; and data power, which asks if the CAC could obtain appropriate data/information in a timely manner. For instance, a metric evaluating change in the number of students using UHS and CaPS due to the calendar chance was considered to have “medium” communication, “low” proxy, and “low” data power since Community Health & Wellbeing experts indicated that changes in UHS and CaPS service utilization is not solely related to the calendar change. 
Data will be collected in a variety of ways, including student surveys, faculty surveys, analysis of existing data, engagement analysis, and faculty focus groups. The next steps for the CAC is to share their plan with relevant groups and then charge the Institutional Research and the Eberly Center with conducting research. 
Currently, the proposed AY 23-24 calendar does also feature the 7-1-7 alignment, and classes are planned for election day.
The next presentation was regarding the creation of a Student & Faculty Ombuds Office. An ombuds is “a designated neutral person who informally and confidentially helps to manage and resolve issues.” Their purpose is to direct individuals to the appropriate formal and/or informal process to resolve concerns. Examples given for why one may visit the Ombuds Office include navigating accusations of plagiarism, concerns about academic integrity violations and investigations, concerns about how instructors or professors are acting, or concerns about going on leave. 
The Ombuds is meant to be an informal option that listens to concerns, provides assistance with evaluating options, and explains university policy and procedures, among other things. They are not meant to provide mental health counseling, offer legal advice, duplicate grievance procedures, conduct formal investigations, or overturn binding decisions. The main words that are used to describe the Student & Faculty Ombuds Office are informal, independent, impartial, and confidential; the identity of visitors to the office will not be disclosed unless permission is given, unless there is an imminent risk of serious harm, or for legal reasons. 
There is currently an ongoing search for someone to fill the position of the ombuds. The goal is to hire a senior teaching track, tenured, or emeritus faculty member at Carnegie Mellon. The committee to hire an ombuds will include a number of students, staff, and administrators. The search is currently planned to begin in November.

Many famous and successful women have been cheated on throughout pop culture history. Princess Diana, Beyoncé, and even Kourtney Kardashian have all had to suffer through the public humiliation of having their significant others cheat on them. While this catches the eye of the public, everyone eventually moves onto a different “hot topic” of the week. In this past month, however, there seems to be an epidemic of celebrity men cheating on their wives such as pop star Adam Levine and comedy actor Ned Fulmer who have both been caught having an affair with another woman, and the internet’s reaction was astonishing. 
Levine is best known for being the lead vocalist and guitarist of the pop rock band Maroon 5 and being a host on TV singing reality show, “The Voice.” It’s safe to say that almost everyone had a Maroon 5 phase in 2017, so the nation was heartbroken to discover he had been having an affair with Instagram model Summer Stroh. Levine’s wife, Behati Prinsloo, is a Victoria’s Secret model and the couple has two children with another on the way. While everyone was shocked by the news, the public was even more shocked by Levine’s flirting methods, or lack thereof. 
Summer Stroh, an Instagram "influencer," released a TikTok where she publicized images of her direct messages with Levine, and the internet went crazy over their exchange. Levine is quoted to have said things as abhorrent as “I may need to see the booty,” which has been pasted over countless memes and is circulating the internet. Stroh was also sufficiently clowned for her video as she said, “I was having an affair with a man who is married to a Victoria’s Secret model. At the time, I was young, I was naïve … I was very easily manipulated.” TikTok users did not like this, as her narrative depicted herself as the victim in the situation and she later elaborated by saying, “I fully realize I’m not the victim in this. I’m not the one who’s really getting hurt here. It’s Behati and her children, and for that, I’m so, so sorry.” 
Levine also took to his Instagram story on Sept. 20 and denied the allegations saying, “I used poor judgment in speaking with anyone other than my wife in ANY kind of flirtatious manner. I did not have an affair, nevertheless, I crossed the line during a regrettable period of my life. In certain instances it became inappropriate. I have addressed that and taken proactive steps to remedy this with my family.” Two more women have come forward with more allegations of Levine cheating; however, he was seen with his wife at one of his concerts recently, and was spotted picking up their kids from school. So, while we can hope that this scandal caused some sort of reckoning for Levine, the larger consequence was his lack of suave when it comes to flirting, and his direct messages can still be found all over the internet. 
A more shocking case of cheating recently concerns Ned Fulmer who is a member of the "Try Guys." The Try Guys is an American online entertainment group and media production company which produces content for their YouTube channel. The show was originally started by BuzzFeed and featured four men who would partake in entertaining activities such as “Trying on Women’s Underwear.” In 2018 the four separated from BuzzFeed and the Try Guys became its own independent company. The four are very successful on YouTube and many feel like they have grown up watching the Try Guys, so the public was horrified to find out that one of the members, Ned Fulmer, was having an affair with a producer for the show. 
Fulmer was exposed by a picture of him kissing one of the producers, which was leaked on Reddit. The internet went wild, mourning what they thought were genuine people making genuine videos. All four had very distinct personalities, and Fulmer had made being a family man his whole brand — usually doting on his wife and kids — making their content seem superficial and fake. In response,  the other three members made a video titled “what happened.” The remaining three members explained that this was as much of a shock to them as it was to the public, as they were in the dark about the affair and Fulmer had been one of their best friends. The issue was not so much that he had cheated on his wife, but that he was having relations with someone who was under his direct supervision. 
For this reason, Fulmer was laid off, but the producer will remain employed, they explained, as he was the one in the position of power. It remains unclear as to whether or not she will decide to stay with the company. The remaining Try Guys also made it clear that they hope the public will not skew the narrative and ensure that blame is not wholly placed on the producer, Alex, because “the internet has a tendency to be a lot harsher towards women than men, so please, we ask that you exercise kindness.” Ned and his wife Ariel have come forward and been seen in public together, both of them saying they would appreciate privacy for the sake of their children and that they are trying to work things out in their marriage. 
The public’s reaction to the Try Guys’ video was wildly positive with tweets such as, “I truly love the way they have addressed this. Between Keith looking disappointed Zach almost crying and just how upset and angry Eugene is, it really shows just how deeply they love what they do and how upset they are over this whole situation. I hope the try guys push through.” Others also saying, “you can tell right away how deeply affected eugene, zach and keith are just watching the video they've uploaded minutes ago... i'm angry and sad because it's also THEIRS life's work what ned is putting at risk with his bullshit. everything is really fucked up.” 
As lovely as the video was, I also feel that it was a little bit of a publicity stunt. While I’m sure they were upset to hear about the actions of their friend, the public seems to forget that they run a business and when Ned ruptured the integrity of their brand, they had to do damage control. The media is acting as if the three have suffered through a tremendous trauma, but the truth of the matter is that they had to make this video to protect their brand from getting defamed. 
Overall, I think the cheating scandals that we have witnessed in the past few weeks have been particularly demonstrative of the interaction between the public and public figures. There has been a large disparity between how the public has reacted to both cases largely due, in my opinion, to the roles both men had. People were angry on behalf of Adam Levine’s wife, but the focus seemed to be more on the fact that he had no flirting game. People were also hasty to jump on Summer Stroh when in reality most of the blame should be put on Levine as he was the one who was cheating on his wife. The reaction to Ned Fulmer’s story was a more personal one. Fans felt personally betrayed by his act and were also very quick to slander the producer. 
Cheating scandals will come and go but we have had our fair share of drama in these past few weeks. The media's reactions to both of these situations were vastly different but nonetheless attention-grabbing. This does make me wonder, if Twitter existed in Princess Diana’s time, what kind of public shaming would King Charles III have to face?

Instagram Reels. YouTube Shorts. Snapchat Spotlight. At some point, every social media platform will become TikTok.
Unless you haven't been on the Internet in a while, you'll know that social media companies are promoting their "TikTok" equivalents like there's no tomorrow. You can tell; Instagram Reels has been populated with videos that seem to say: "I heard people only check Reels now, so here's a picture as a video." However, Instagram's sole purpose when it was created was being a platform for posting photos. YouTube’s new YouTube Shorts at least make sense for a video-sharing website — even though Shorts have really just been filled with TikTok re-uploads. Even Reddit has started implementing TikTok-like videos, where just watching one video will lead you into an infinite rabbit hole of videos. Why are we forcing these perfectly good social media platforms to be TikTok, when they already have their own purposes to fulfill? Why are we forcing them to be anything other than what they are?
In earlier days of the Internet, websites each catered to a niche group of users: MySpace for entertainment; Tumblr for art, writing, and mindless blogging; VSCO for romantics; Twitter for politics; Reddit for memes; Vines for short video memes, etc. Even if you couldn't find your community there, you could always subscribe to blogs, or start up your own and gain a little cult following.
Today, it is difficult for anyone to get attention on anything but “mainstream” social media. Even if you started a social media platform of your own, you'd probably have to promote it on existing social media! It's a feedback loop: people go to a social platform because it connects them to a community, however niche the community may be. Then, as more users flock to the platform, the network of users gets bigger and bigger. To get the most attention, public figures and creators will go to the most popular social network, which will give them the most reach. And more people will go to those platforms because "everyone else is on it," including friends and celebrities. So, social media will continue to become more concentrated: Facebook acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp; Google acquiring YouTube; and even TikTok can be seen as a derivative of Vine. 
Every social media company right now knows how incredibly popular TikTok is and feels threatened by its success. Instead of starting from the ground up, they're trying to copy TikTok's best features to make TikTok useless. But they haven't been very successful beyond being inferior derivatives, and they need to realize it. TikTok is good enough to stand on its own without being bought out or out-competed by other companies. Instead of trying to take over every other tech company, Meta, YouTube, and Snapchat should focus on doing what they do best or figuring out what they can offer that TikTok can't.
So how do we make these companies realize that they can't continue to copy TikTok? I'd say to think of a similar problem: urbanization.
Urbanization, at its simplest, is when cities become larger, more industrial, and have to accommodate more people. When a city becomes more successful, more people will go and live there. With more people, it's more likely for unknown actors and start-ups to become successful celebrities and businesses. With more success, people will want to go to absorb some of that success — as well as the resources and environment that contributed to previous successes. And that's how you get sprawling metropolises like New York City and San Francisco.
But we can't have every single human being live in NYC. Besides the fact that it's not physically possible and would drive up housing prices beyond the exorbitant prices there already are, most people can't afford to move there, and we still need businesses to provide to populations in suburban and rural areas. So what happens?
Localization happens. Instead of trying and failing to offer what big cities can, small cities appeal using their own unique features. They promote their natural landscapes, their peacefulness, their local style of cooking, the quirks of their community, etc. They also promote other things that come with the natural boundaries of states and cities, like their politics, the success, or types, of schools in their area, and their natural landscapes and weather. Pittsburgh, for one, is known for its manufacturing and steel history, its many, many bridges, and for having a bunch of colleges in the area — Carnegie Mellon of course being one. (It's also known for having gloomy weather nearly year-round — or maybe that's just how I feel, coming from California, where we have sunny days for upwards of 200 out of 365 days of the year.)
I digress. In any case, this is exactly what we need in social media: appeal to smaller communities. Instead of trying to get every single human being using one social media platform, we should encourage small platforms to appeal to subsets of the population. Let SMS do the job of reaching everyone instead.
However, social media definitely faces a problem that cities do not: social media can basically reach everyone with Internet access. At least people have to be within commuting distance of a big city to partake in its culture — leading those further away to just be content with their small city life and develop small city culture. However, with the Internet, the barrier of physical distance is no longer there, making it harder for small social media platforms to thrive. Tech companies are also notoriously anti-competitive. Lawsuits have been filed alleging how tech companies promote their own products over those of competitors. (Remember that because of the popularity of mainstream social media, tech companies still need to promote their products on rival platforms. For example, Facebook/Meta has a YouTube account, YouTube has a Facebook and Instagram account, small search engines like Ecosia also post ads on bigger search engines like Google.)
So, it's unlikely that anything will change soon. However, seeing the popularity of BeReal, a small social media startup that's still visibly buggy and not very secure, I think there's hope for change. BeReal succeeds where others fail: Content creation is quick, reliable, and low effort. BeReal also doesn't really require a large social network for people to be attracted to it — the main issue for most small social media companies — because BeReal's premise is that users will only add their "real friends," not just acquaintances they met a couple of times. This approach results in a small but consistent user base, many of whom (like me) don't post on other social media networks due to the effort needed to curate an account, and also just due to introversion. However, even BeReal is being co-opted by larger social media companies, such as Snapchat, which has rolling a BeReal-esque dual camera feature.
Still, if BeReal sticks around, I think there's real promise for similar small social media platforms to thrive. People have tried and failed many, many times to start a social media revolution, but if social media platforms continue to become more and more similar to each other, consumers may simply ditch the biggest platforms entirely and find community elsewhere.

On Oct. 1, 2022, tragedy struck the Kanjuruhan stadium in East Java, Indonesia. At least 125 fans lost their lives after chaos and riots. It was one of the world’s deadliest stadium disasters.
Local soccer arch-rivals Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya were playing each other, and as the match ended, visitors Persebaya Surabaya recorded a 3-2 away victory — their first victory at Arema’s stadium in 23 years. The rivalry between the two teams is known to be so intense that visiting fans are often barred from traveling to the home stadium for the game. 
At the full-time whistle, furious Arema fans — known as “Aremania” — stormed the pitch to demand answers from players, with some throwing objects. Outside the stadium, fans also caused chaos, flipping and burning police cars, among other violent acts.
The police’s response was equally, if not more, violent. Video footage shows some policemen in riot gear kicking or beating fans with sticks. Moreover, tear gas was used towards the fans in the stands, causing a stampede towards the exit. The stadium was filled with approximately 42,000 fans, even though its capacity is 38,000. Many suffocated or got trampled upon, likely including women and children. It is being reported that 34 people were killed in this stampede alone, with the number rising to 125 as deaths mounted in hospitals.
As an avid soccer fan myself, the two most recent tragedies I remember are the Chapecoense plane crash in 2016 and the Emiliano Sala incident in 2019. However, this event is largely different from the two aforementioned events because it was a stadium disaster involving two distinct parties: fans and the police.
The general trend of pitch invasions has been increasing, as seen by the end of last season. These are incredibly dangerous for both fans and players alike, primarily because it can create disasters like this in which lives are lost. 
Concerning the fans, with whom my perspective lies, I do not have particularly much to say. I, too, feel passionate towards a game where 22 people kick and chase after a rolling ball. When I watch games, my heartrate does rise, and I do sigh with frustration, shake my head with disbelief or — occasionally — use obscenities. Sports have that kind of power. I can only imagine how amplified these reactions will be when surrounded by thousands of other like-minded individuals with the game unfolding before your eyes. 
On the other hand, invading the pitch should never be an option. I do understand frustration, I really do. Believe me, I support Tottenham Hotspur. However, at the end of the day, the players are all human — humans who strive to be the best version of themselves. Sometimes these players, like us, cannot be perfect. They are only human after all. Sure, I do think some Spurs players are far from sublime; however, these reflect my thoughts on them as soccer players — not as humans. 
I am biased by saying that I would never do something such as the Aremania did. These fans almost certainly have a stronger bond with the team than I do with any sports team and will likely ever hold. To these fans, their team is a “culture and an identity,” and they are nicknamed "mania" for a reason. Like many other countries around the world, Indonesia is going through economic hardships. Soccer as a form of escapism becomes even more powerful than it already was. From a fellow fan and an outsider’s perspective, I can understand where their reactions stem from. 
The police’s role in this disaster has some more nuances worth considering. To provide some context, Indonesia has one of the most violent soccer fan cultures in the world, with 74 soccer-related deaths since 1994 (not including the Oct. 1 tragedy). This was one of the matches with the highest potential to sprawl out of control. Many of the policemen were dressed in riot gear, and were equipped with tear gas, which was ultimately used. However, tear gas is banned even in warfare — why were police carrying tear gas in the first place at a soccer game? 
In my view, the largest potential change to prevent any such future event is systematic. Fan behavior cannot change overnight. Culture is ingrained, and it will take a long time for impactful changes to be seen. However, better policing or crowd controlling policies is something that can be put into place within a shorter period of time. Firstly, police should never have tear gas on them, a chemical which is banned by FIFA in the first place. Tear gas symbolizes the anticipation of and preparation for chaos. More effort should be put into prevention of such disasters before they happen, not reaction after they happen. The first step could be to improve the stadiums. According to people who have watched games at Indonesian stadiums, the conditions aren’t great: signs are unclear, crowds are cramped when entering and exiting the stadium, and exits are often locked or blocked. Also, of course, the number of people in the stadium should never exceed the capacity. 
Let us all hope something similar never happens again — in Indonesia or anywhere around the world — and do everything we can to prevent it.

Spoiler Warning for “Verity”
I’m going to be honest, I’m not the biggest fan of Colleen Hoover books. I frankly think they’re overhyped, hard to get into, and have horrible covers (to echo our beloved Novel-tea writer and Forum editor, the fonts Hoover uses are just awful). But despite my reservations — and frankly, downright animosity — towards reading Colleen Hoover, I still gave “Verity” a chance. 
And honestly… it wasn’t terrible. 
Spoiler warning in case you missed the one at the top of this piece because there’s no way I can talk about why this book wasn’t bad without talking about the specific plot points that made me think that.  
We start the book with the main character, Lowen, witnessing a car accident on the way to a meeting. In true romance fashion, the attractive stranger, Jeremy, who helps her recover from witnessing something traumatic also happens to be at this meeting — and he hires her to be the ghostwriter for his injured wife (Verity) to finish her bestselling series. 
Of course, she is basically broke and super behind on rent, so she HAS to move into his mysterious mansion to go through his wife’s office so she can plan the next book. While there, she finds a manuscript for an autobiography that explains every major life event that Verity and Jeremy went through, except Verity describes it in an entirely disturbing and narcissistic way. She basically admits to killing her daughter, and Lowen is torn over whether telling Jeremy this will help him or hurt him more.
Yet, at the same time as Lowen is reading these chapters, she’s noticing weird things going on in this house. She hears strange comments from Verity’s son, which altogether make it sound like Verity — who is supposedly in a catatonic state in an upstairs bedroom and unable to move — is actually very healthy and just faking the entire thing. Of course, Lowen, already freaked out by the diary entries, thinks that Verity is out to get her. It might be because Lowen is making a move on Verity’s husband. Maybe she’s just feeling guilty that she’s in a romantic relationship with a man while his wife is still upstairs.
When Lowen actually sees Verity move, she finally breaks and tells Jeremy everything, leading to a massive confrontation where Verity admits to faking everything and Jeremy starts attacking her. Lowen’s reaction? To tell Jeremy to not just kill her then — he has to make it look like an accident. So they do.
Jump to three months later, where Lowen is pregnant and she and Jeremy are cleaning out the old mansion. Lowen discovers a letter hidden in the floor, where Verity explains that the entire autobiography was a writing exercise to practice getting in the head of her psychotic characters, and that not only did Jeremy already discover the manuscript, but he caused her “accident” because he believed it. This time, Lowen destroys the letter and doesn’t tell Jeremy, so that only she has to wonder what was real and what was a work of fiction.
Amazing cliff hanger, right?
No way to know if the real Verity was the one from the manuscript or the one from the note, if Jeremy was a concerned father or an apathetic husband, or if Lowen acted in self-defense or cold-blooded murder. What an amazing execution for a book that would make an amazing adaptation into the next hit psychological thriller!
Or it would be if Colleen Hoover wrote thrillers. 
Because that my friends… was a YA romance book. 
Yes, you read that correctly. The big takeaway from this novel, the plot that's being marketed, is not in fact the mystery over whether Verity is actually in a coma, but the (poorly developed) romance between Lowen and Verity’s husband. The ghostwriter and the husband, united in murder. Talk about a toxic relationship.
And therein lies my issue with Colleen Hoover’s writing. Every single book features a different toxic relationship, but most of the others don’t have an engaging thriller subplot to keep the reader’s attention. If it’s not infidelity and murder, it’s falling in love with the man who almost killed you. If not that, it's a romance with a boy who grew up homeless in the protagonist’s backyard. If not that, it’s getting involved with a man who’s so emotionally stunted his POV doesn’t even contain complete thoughts.
Clearly, the theme is characters with graphic trauma and little else in terms of characterization. But romance tends to be character-driven, so where does that leave us?
For me? Unsatisfied and frankly, annoyed. 
It’s book after book of toxic relationships between irredeemable characters marketed as relatable romances. If this is supposed to be relatable, every one of these characters needs a therapist, and a solid handful just need to be in jail. More importantly, if this was real life then these traumas wouldn’t be romanticized and this level of abuse would hopefully not be tolerated, either by the person themselves or their support network. These aren’t situations where the characters are trapped in the cycle of abuse – these characters are choosing to stay, and either romanticizing the man abusing them or also acting abusive in response.
What Colleen Hoover is doing is modeling how to stay in unhealthy relationships even when they harm the character’s mental and physical health, and oh yeah, she’s three for three, there’s emotional abuse too. She’s showing young readers who are entering relationships for the first time (or fifth time) exactly how NOT to treat your partner, but it’s not exactly clear at first (or ever). Even beyond that, she’s using trauma and violence to further the plot and fuel her crazy plot twists, which is so damaging for the people who have actually experienced similar things. 
I get it. She’s writing what she knows will sell. But there needs to be accountability for the harmful narratives she’s putting out in the world, and the impact that can have on her audience. The idea of a traumatized love interest and a heroine with an “I can fix him” mentality isn’t new to romance or particularly harmful when it’s paired with a healthy dose of character growth and a relationship that, while perhaps questionable, stays far away from toxic or abusive. What Colleen Hoover does is decidedly not that.
Colleen Hoover isn’t a bad writer… all the time. “Verity” didn’t make me want to "Did Not Finish" the book in favor of chucking it at a wall like some of her other books. But I’ve also never finished one of her books without a bad taste in my mouth and a feeling that something I read was wrong on a deeper level. Colleen Hoover needs to either learn to write romance without relying on trauma and abusive relationships (because no, it doesn’t make the books “higher quality” or more “real”), or change genres to something else. 
At the very least, for the love of all things romance, just admit your books cover sensitive topics and include a trigger warning. The next time a book starts with the main character being splattered with gore while witnessing a car accident (I’m looking at you, “Verity”), I’d at least like to know what I’m getting into.

Novel-tea is The Tartan’s literary and language opinion column, so if you like hot takes and reading about cool ideas in the literary community then this is the place for you!! If you have your own hot take to add to this column, do not hesitate to contact us.
When I was in fifth grade, my school made us complete weekly reading logs. It was something I dreaded more than anything, having to fill up those time logs with reading. I dreamt of doing literally anything else. I couldn’t stand reading. I couldn’t focus and, like many people, when I was told I should do something, it made actually doing it that much more difficult.
It took me a long time to fall in love with books, but once I did, they became something truly special. But, why? Why did it take me so long to actually enjoy reading? For one, I constantly felt bombarded by the pressure to enjoy reading at an age when I felt that was impossible. I felt trapped by reading, rather than encouraged, and it wasn’t until I found a book series on my own, one which I truly loved and was enraptured by, that I was able to love books the way I do now. 
There is a widespread belief that everyone should always be reading. That reading fosters knowledge and encourages you to become a better, more educated person, in a way that other media supposedly does not. This idea that reading is something you must always be doing likens it to going to the gym, and books become things you buy merely as a New Year’s resolution to sit pretty upon your nightstand untouched. 
While it is true that reading is a great activity for anybody, we need to stop treating it like a chore. Books can be our guiltiest pleasures, a haven for the nerd inside all of us. But, if we continue to treat reading at a distance, making it seem less applicable and accessible than it has the capability to be, we put everyone at a disadvantage. As corny as this may sound, books can be really fun. From cute romance novels, to wild fantasy series with crazy world-building, to nonfiction analyses of the world, there is something for all of us in books. In a world where a new crisis seems to occur every other hour, books help us ground ourselves and open our minds to new ideas and critical thinking.
An article from Vox explains that, “Reading fiction, though, studies have found, tends to retrain the brain to stay open, comfortable with ambiguity, and able to sort through information more carefully.” Reading for fun, for yourself, can do more for your mindfulness, compassion, and sanity when approaching the world than we’re even aware of. 
It is high time we stop forcing reading down people’s throats and start encouraging books as an avenue for fun, self-improvement, and compassion that is desperately needed. No one should dread picking up a book; instead, they should be encouraged to read whatever they so desire and revel in that. If your thing is flavoring snails, there is a book for you. If your thing is Lego origami, there is a book for you. Anything and everything you think is a little niche interest; you can probably find an enrapturing book about. Go read it. Stop caring about making sure it’s “scholarly” and give yourself the space to spend time reading about the quirky interests that make you who you are. That is what reading should be.

As we start the seventh week of classes (didn’t the semester just start last week?), we will be halfway through the semester as of Friday. Next week is Fall Break, a week off of classes which was created to give students a more balanced feel between the semesters. Both the fall and spring semesters are built on a “7-1-7” mentality. The semesters start with seven weeks of classes, there’s a one week break, and then seven more weeks of classes before finals. 
In previous years, the fall mid-semester break has only been one or two days — not nearly enough time for students to actually take a break from classes. A full week offers the chance for students to take time to relax, travel abroad or home if they want, and actually remove themselves from school.
A popular counterargument to an extended fall break is that it cuts instructional days. Last year, Carnegie Mellon also had 14-week semesters, but only a two day mid-semester break. Despite this, there was one less instructional day last year. The current proposed 2023-2024 academic calendar is currently slated to have 65 instructional days in the fall semester, like this year and also includes a week-long fall break. As the fall break appears to be here to stay, it must seem to have some benefit to the administration.
One of the most frustrating opinions that students seem to have about fall break is that some professors will still assign an excessive amount of coursework to be completed over break. Why are students giving professors such little credit? Fall break is also a chance for faculty to relax; they’re people just like students are. It seems many students believe professors always have it out for them, which isn’t the case. So, instead of complaining about a week-long break, some students should reevaluate their relationship with their schoolwork and professors. 
Professors aren’t here to overwork their students or ensure they fail — if that is the case, then their position should be reviewed. They’re here to ensure students learn what they need to be successful. Most professors are willing to make accommodations and work with their students to a reasonable degree. Regardless of these, we’ve heard many students demonize their professors, which is an unreasonable way to treat them. 
Those in opposition also seem to forget how nice it is to have a break in the middle of a semester, especially for mini classes. The 7-1-7 model allows for a week break between first-half and second-half mini classes, which simply makes sense. The week-long break allows for clear separation for first-half minis to wrap up and preparation for second-half minis to begin. 
It’s no secret that there is a general feeling that Carnegie Mellon students tend to overwork themselves and have a Stockholm Syndrome-like relationship with their work. Our work holds us captive from actually taking the time to relax, take a break, and hang out with friends, but we continue to do our work anyways out of fear of falling behind our peers or simply not being or doing enough. It’s a tale as old as time on this campus, and that mentality needs to change. Enjoying yourself is just as essential a part of the college experience as the education that we are receiving, and that sentiment seems to be lacking from a sizable portion of the student body.
We at the Tartan implore you to please just take a moment to relax next week during fall break. The world’s not going to end because you decided to go out with some friends for an evening or travel home to see your family. After all, your life will continue long after you leave Carnegie Mellon, so take the time to learn how to enjoy yourself while you’re here. Taking a break doesn’t make you any less of a student; it actually adds to the experience by ensuring you are taking care of yourself. So this fall break, make sure you look out for yourself.

        We're testing a new look for The Tartan. Let us know what you think!
