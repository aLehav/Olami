The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams competed this weekend at the 2010 NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships in Minneapolis.
For the women’s team, sole competitor junior Molly Evans swam the 200-yard backstroke, placing second in the consolation final with a time of 2:03.68. Evans also competed in the 200-yard freestyle, placing 12th, and the 500-yard freestyle, placing 10th. Evans also earned her third career Honorable Mention All-American. Overall, Evans tallied 19 points to finish 34th out of 51 swimmers.
“I think the way the meet went was a great way to end my season,” said Evans. “Although my backstroke wasn’t where I’ve been in the past, I know that this will keep me humble and motivate me to work hard this summer.”
For the men’s swimming team, first-year Dan Glaser-Garbrick placed eighth in the 200-yard butterfly with a time of 1:51.08, earning his first All-America honor. Senior Scott Moorby competed in the 100-yard backstroke and took third with a career-best time of 50.34. Like his fellow teammate, Moorby picked up an Honorable Mention All-American title. The men’s 800-yard freestyle relay also swam at the meet, setting a new school record with the team of senior Jeff Dahlen, junior Frank Olechnowicz, senior Gates Winkler, and junior Alex Hanson. 
The team earned Honorable Mention recognition, placing 12th in the race with a new school record of 6:48.37.
“It was really cool getting top eight as a freshman,” said Glaser-Garbrick. “It was a real thrill to be up there on the podium at my first nationals and I can only hope to build on this success over my next three years.”
Olechnowicz, who also made his championships debut at the meet, added, “Making nationals and then getting All-America was a great experience. It was great being able to accomplish something greater than the goals I had set for myself and I couldn’t have been more joyful making this meet and succeeding like I did.”
On the last day of the championships, senior Jonas Altman-Kurosaki placed sixth in the 1650-yard freestyle, earning All-American honors with a time of 15:46.72. Olechnowicz also swam this event, and received his second Honorable Mention All-American honor at the meet. Olechnowicz placed 12th in the event, with a career-best time of 15:58.27. Winkler finished 17th in 16:10.44. 
Dahlen swam the 200-yard backstroke, earning an Honorable Mention All-American honor for his performance, and placed second in the consolation final with a career-best and school record time of 1:48.97. Moorby also competed in the event, finishing 25th in the preliminaries with a time of 1:52.50. The men’s team was able to place five swimmers overall during the meet in the top 16, finishing out the second at the NCAA competition placing 15th out of 61 schools.
“That was the perfect way to round out my swimming career,” said Dahlen. “It’s nice to know I went out with a bang, and even the day afterwards, I still feel fantastic.”
This marks the end of the season for the swimming and diving team. Competition will resume next season in October.

In sunny Claremont, Calif. during spring break, the number-nine Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team was busy defeating several top teams from the Western region. The Tartans prevailed over Chapman University, number-17 Redlands University, and number-13 Trinity University on their trip to bring their season record to 10–4.
The Tartans started their first match of the break with a 9–0 victory over Chapman University. After a quick sweep of doubles to put Carnegie Mellon ahead 3–0, the Tartans took the remaining six singles in straight sets, with the exception of senior James Muliawan, who topped his opponent 10–4 in a third-set tiebreak.
Two days later the Tartans were able to face their longtime rival, the University of Redlands. The third time was the charm, as the Tartans were able to decisively overcome the Bulldogs 6–3 after losing 5–4 the previous two years. First-year Duke Miller and partner sophomore Jeremy King added the only doubles point to the total, beating their opponents 8–6. Not wanting a repeat of the previous year’s losses, the Tartans rallied from 1–2 and won five singles matches to give them the win. Notable wins came from junior Alex Nemerov and first-year Harsha Rao, 6–3, 6–1, and 6–3, 6–2, respectively.
“This week showed us what we need to work on, since we were down in doubles against all three ranked teams we played,” Spero noted. “I was impressed with our singles, though, especially against Redlands.”
The real strength test for the Tartans came during their third match, when the Tartans faced fifth-ranked Claremont Mudd-Scripps in an evening match. With the natural elements working against the normally indoor court-conditioned Tartans, they were unable to gain an early advantage from the doubles matches. The only win came from the number-one doubles duo of Muliawan and his partner, senior Niko Ljuboja. Muliawan also won the only singles match against the Athenas, topping Ronald Wu 6–3, 6–2. This loss (7–2) would be the only one of the trip, however.
“This was a really tough team, but the difference between them and us wasn’t that significant,” Ljuboja commented. 
With only one day left in their vacation, the Tartans faced their final and most determined opponents yet. Number-13 Trinity University had a well-balanced team, with tough players in spots one through six. At the end of the doubles round, the Tartans found themselves down 2–1, with the single point coming thanks to the duo of King and Miller.
As the singles round progressed, the Tigers kept the Tartans on edge with sharp playing and unorthodox tactics. Miller contributed a win at fourth singles, 6–3, 6–4, while senior Jonathan Spero breezed through his match at fifth singles, dropping only four games, 6–1, 6–3. With the score showing a slim 3–2 Tartan lead, the outcome of the match was still unclear. 
Nemerov finished his match a short while later, winning in three and coming back from being down 4–6. The final point came from junior Bobby MacTaggart. MacTaggart, who plays a power game, faced an opponent also named Bobby, who loved hitting the ball with brute force just as much as MacTaggart. In an entertaining finale, MacTaggart outlasted his opponent 6–4, 3–6, 6–1 to give the Tartans the win, 5–4.
“CMS just outplayed us. They played at a very high level and showed us that we need to raise our level if we want to compete for a national championship,” Spero reflected at the end of the trip. “California was a good learning experience, but most importantly we took care of business out there and beat two very good teams. We’ll be having tough practices this week because we know Mary Washington is a great team that can beat us if we aren’t ready to play.”
The Tartans play their first match on home courts against Johns Hopkins University on Sunday, April 4. They are next in action Saturday at the University of Mary Washington in Virginia.

Just last week, the Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team, ranked 11th in Division III, competed in California for the team’s traditional spring break trip. After starting out slowly and getting used to the nice weather, the Tartans overcame some recent losses to finish the trip with a record of 3–1, leaving them at 8–3 overall.
The Tartans started off their spring break play by traveling to Chapman University, a team that was ranked 23rd at the time. Under the beating sun, the Tartans staked themselves to an early 2–1 lead in doubles. Sophomore Courtney Chin and junior Kelly Hart ground their opponents down for a win at second doubles with a score of 8–4. The third doubles team of junior Jennifer Chui and freshman Alex Tapak steamrolled their opponents to put the Tartans in the lead going into the always-competitive singles play. Unfortunately for the Tartans, singles did not work out as they expected. Singles wins by Chin and fellow sophomore Cze-Ja Tam got the Tartans one win away from clinching, but they were unable to finish. In a grueling sixth singles match, senior Alisa Liebowitz fell short by a score of 6–3, 0–6, 6–3, handing the Tartans a surprising loss to begin spring break.
Later in the week, the Tartans looked forward to redeeming themselves after a disappointing start. Their next match was against 10th-ranked University of Redlands. With the boisterous Redlands fans looking on, Carnegie Mellon jumped out to take a 2–1 lead by winning at the first and third doubles spots. The Tartans then showed the Bulldogs who was the better team, winning five of the six singles matches. The match was not without drama, however, as Chin had a marathon match at first singles. After dropping the first set, Chin used the support of her fellow Tartans along with a big forehand to capture the match in a tiebreaker.
Two days later, the women traveled to seventh-ranked Pomona-Pitzer College for a date with the Sagehens. From the beginning of the match, the Tartans took control, making sure that their opponents knew that they were the better team. After sweeping all three doubles matches, the Tartans clinched the match easily by winning five out of six singles matches. One notable match came from Chui, playing fourth singles, who beat a tough Pomona-Pitzer player with a score of 7–5, 6–2. For the Tartans, this was a huge win, and their second in a row over a top-10 nationally ranked team.
The Tartans then concluded a successful spring break by handily defeating Trinity College (Texas) with a score of 8–1. Chin, who played first singles most of the week, went undefeated at that spot by finishing with a convincing 6–0, 6–2 win. 
By finishing the week with a 3–1 overall record, the Tartans notched some much-needed wins after a string of disappointing losses.
“We were able to get our momentum back this week,” junior Ashley Herrick said. “Hard work and focus is what it takes to compete at a top level.”
The Tartans will continue their quest for a national championship against California University of Pennsylvania at home on Wednesday at 4 p.m.

The Carnegie Mellon track and field team competed in the University Athletic Association (UAA) championships at Brandeis University on March 6. The men’s team placed fourth overall while the women took seventh.
The highlight of the meet for the men was senior James Hulley’s performance, with a win in both the weight throw and the shot put. In the weight throw, Hulley managed a distance of 16.35 meters. Senior Chris Fornataro put up a strong performance and placed behind Hulley, throwing a distance of 15.12 meters. In the shot put, Hulley took the gold with a throw of 16.07 meters.
The Tartan men continued to dominate on the field. Senior Chris Bridgman tied for second place in the pole vault, reaching a height of 4.40 meters. 
Junior Pat O’Brien also had a stellar meet, finishing sixth in three events. The first of these was in the high jump, where he cleared a height of 1.81 meters. He also scored sixth in the long and triple jump, leaping 6.40 meters and 13.11 meters, respectively.
Junior Nate Bussiere scored third in the mile, finishing in 4:21.36, while teammate sophomore Rob Morhard finished the 800-meter run in 1:18:07, earning sixth place. Finally, the 4x400 relay composed of Bussiere, O’Brien, junior Dustin Musselman, and first-year John Caverhill, grabbed third in 3:26.49. With a final strong showing to end their season, the men have much to be proud of.
On the women’s side, the seventh-place finish was decorated with two new school records. The first was set by sophomore Luci Laffitte, who placed fourth in the 55-meter hurdles with a time of 8.94 seconds. 
The second school record was set by the distance medley relay team of junior Laura McKee, senior Crystal LeePow, senior Diane Mattingly, and junior Courtney Baker, which placed sixth with a time of 12:25.75. 
“Everyone ran really well in the relay. All the teams were very competitive in the relay, and although we didn’t do as well, we all put out our best,” McKee said. “Training this winter has been really rough with the weather, but we did well considering the circumstances. As for NCAAs, we’re just hoping to improve and do well in the spring season.” 
Mattingly also shone in the 400-meter run, finishing fourth in 1:00.39. In addition, Laffitte, LeePow, Mattingly, and Baker joined forces once again in the 4x400-meter relay to score fifth, with a time of 4:10.51.
On the field, the women continued to meet with success. Sophomore Ivana Moses scored fifth in the triple jump, hitting the 10.42-meter mark. She was closely followed by junior Melissa Hwang, who earned seventh in the event, leaping 10.27 meters. Junior Morgan Faer threw a career best of 12.21 meters in the weight throw, coming in seventh.
Finally, in the pole vault, sophomore Lisa Marion Garcia cleared a careerbest of 2.60 meters, finishing ninth in the conference.

With the snow melted away and spring showing signs of being here for good, Carnegie Mellon’s spring sports season is underway. Notably, the men’s tennis team is currently ranked ninth in the country in Division III. While the team was competing in Claremont, Calif. for their spring break trip, first-year Duke Miller was named the University Athletic Association’s (UAA) Men’s Tennis Athlete of the Week for his several victories in singles and doubles, paired with sophomore teammate Jeremy King.
Miller hails from Poway, Calif., which lies north of San Diego. Although Miller notes the extreme variation of Pittsburgh weather as a cool college experience, he would ideally like to return to sunny Southern California to pursue a career in biomedical engineering after he graduates. Aside from having a busy schedule with school and tennis, Miller has a passion for producing and mixing music from various genres, which he hopes to maintain as a hobby throughout his life.
Adjusting to college life has been a positive experience for Miller, which he credits to being a part of the tennis team. “I’m very happy that I have tennis, as it has provided me with a close group of friends that I could hang out with and relate to, right when school started at a time when I knew less people and wasn’t used to college life,” he said. While Carnegie Mellon has raised his personal expectations to a higher level, Miller is enjoying the balance of athletics and academics so far. Miller originally began playing tennis at age 11, and his family’s background in the sport has urged him to keep playing into college. With a spot within the national top 10 right now, Miller hopes that the Tartans will continue to climb the rankings as the season progresses, and hopes that he can continue to add to the team’s success.

It’s that special time of year again, when the madness starts.
Last Thursday, the men’s NCAA basketball tournament kicked off and, as usual, didn’t fail to disappoint. There were, of course, the expected games, such as first-seeded Kentucky’s win over 16th-seeded Eastern Tennessee State, but upsets were to be found as well. 14th-seeded Ohio beat third-seeded Georgetown, and 15th-seeded Robert Morris came surprisingly close to victory over second-seeded Villanova in overtime. Everyone’s bracket is certainly hurting after first-seed Kansas lost to ninth-seed Northern Iowa in a close match. The tournament is off to a great start, and it will certainly have even more twists and turns before the champion is decided on April 5.
If the 63 games occurring aren’t over the span of a little more than three weeks enough for you to be at least slightly interested in the tourney, the potential to get involved using brackets just might. Although every NCAA tournament is filled with great basketball playing, it’s almost more impressive to see how many people get involved in the action. If there was ever a time to jump on the bandwagon, this is it.
I’ll admit myself that I have not watched a full college basketball game all year. But that didn’t stop me from staying up until almost 2 a.m. making sure that my bracket would be ready to go so I wouldn’t miss out on the action. My family makes a pool every year and there was no way I was going to miss out in the prize money, trash-talking, or cheering that goes along with it.
Junior chemical and biomedical engineering major Laura McKee explained the hype. “Filling out a bracket is my way to be involved in March Madness. It’s a really exciting tournament, and filling out brackets makes it even more fun to watch the games,” McKee said.
Not to date myself, but I remember the days when I got my bracket from the newspaper and wrote the teams in myself. But now with more easily accessible blank brackets, there’s no excuse to not make a bracket. Websites such as ESPN.com, Yahoo!, and even Facebook make brackets accessible at the click of a button. They even update automatically, making them even easier to use. I’ve used multiple sites at a time for the different pools I participate in. At one point, I was checking three different websites — one for family, one for friends, and one for work — to track my progress within each group.
Even though I don’t watch the games all season long, I can access game analysis and previews, which are often linked right to the matchup on the bracket. Percentages of who picked who are given, letting me know instantaneously if I’ve picked the dark horse or if everyone else was thinking exactly the same thing. Brackets make watching the games more interactive and fun to follow. They are simple to use and add features to simplify it even further.
Not that picking the winner based on statistics is even necessarily what the tournament is about. Josh Plotnik, a junior biology major, said, “March Madness is about rooting for the underdog and watching the big dogs fail. Everyone hopes to win their bracket, but in reality, they would much rather see their championship pick lose to a 15 seed in the first round.” Because the tournament is so unpredictable, you never know what to expect. 
Junior chemical engineering major Eric Roudabush added, “Odds of picking a perfect bracket are horrible. There is lots of luck involved, but it’s fun to try to pick upsets.”
By picking a winner for each game, each matchup becomes important. It’s not just the final winner who counts. Roudabush explained, “You only have one favorite team. By making a bracket you can find a team you don’t really know to root for just so you can have a good bracket.” McKee had a similar idea. “We don’t have a team here at CMU, but by picking teams in your bracket, you have someone to cheer for.”
Even watching the games has become easier. The NCAA, in collaboration with cbssports.com, streams the action live on their website. “I watch as many as I can. This year I was a little busy, but I’ve seen at least parts of eight or 10 of the games,” Roudabush said.
So while bandwagoning might get a bad rap, I don’t mind it. College basketball gets the national spotlight for a few weeks, and anyone, from die-hard fans to confused bandwagoners, can enjoy it all the same.

As electronic devices get smaller and smaller, the buttons, touch screens, and knobs we use to control them must do the same. A need for usability constrains the size of devices and is often the only thing that keeps devices from getting smaller and more convenient to carry. Chris Harrison, a third-year Ph.D. student at the Human Computer Interaction Institute, has found a way to move the method of input outside the device, removing this inconvenient constraint.
His product, “Skinput,” developed in conjunction with Microsoft researchers Dan Morris and Desney Chan, seeks to allow people to interact with their electronics simply by touching different parts of their forearms. It effectively transforms an arm into a touchscreen or touchpad.
According to a Carnegie Mellon press release, “bone and soft tissue variations” in the arm mean that tapping one part of the arm produces different sounds and vibrations than tapping some other part. These vibrations then travel up the arm, where sensors can determine the frequency. Since each location has a distinctive frequency, the sensors can determine which part of the arm was tapped. Harrison said that the sensors are devices known as piezoelectric crystals, which produce an electric current in response to vibration, and an array of 10 such sensors placed in an armband are used to detect the vibrations. Each crystal is tuned to detect a particular characteristic frequency.
The signals generated by the sensors are then passed through a set of machine learning algorithms that improve the accuracy of the sensors and give the location of tapping with greater certainty. Despite the fact that human arms are quite different from person to person, Harrison said that his system is extremely accurate as long as the appropriate positions are chosen and as long as the number of locations to tap is kept small. His paper on the technology notes that up to 95 percent accuracy can be achieved using certain easily accessible locations on the arm.
Skinput forms one part of Harrison’s grander plans for allowing people to “interact with small things in big ways.” The idea is to be able to “appropriate” other objects to use as input devices. Harrison feels that one way to reduce the size of input devices is to make use of something that we already carry around with us: our arm. His previous methods used similar technologies to use tables as input devices, but as Harrison said in an interview, “you can’t take a table everywhere you go.”
Harrison sees Skinput as filling a niche for highly portable, large-scale input devices, possibly complementing projectors. “Projectors already provide us with small devices that produce a large output, but input devices have not yet caught up,” he said. One variation of Harrison’s technology has a small projector (called a pico projector) attached to the Skinput arm band, which allows menu items and such to be projected onto the hand.
One application of Skinput that Harrison envisions is a way to control music players, which are already controlled by a limited number of buttons. He envisions a jogger tapping her thumb and forefinger together to skip tracks or her thumb and ring finger to increase the volume. This also takes advantage of the fact that we are aware of the position of our arms and fingers without looking at them (a phenomenon called proprioception, as explained on Harrison’s website, http://www.chrisharrison.net/projects/skinput/). This enables using devices without having to divert our attention to them. This could act as an extension of devices such as the iPod Shuffle, which already functions well without a screen. 
Whatever the case, Harrison’s projects are on the path to bringing the bond between humans and computers even closer.

The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) has long been recognized as a leader in the use of information technology solutions within the center’s health care facilities. Having been named one of the 100 Most Wired hospitals and health systems in the United States by Hospitals & Health Networks magazine for 10 years in a row, it is no question that UPMC strives to remain on the frontier of medical information technology and efficiency.
Recently, UPMC has introduced a new personal health record system that will revolutionize the way we manage health information. According to www.upmc.com, the system, which was a proof-of-concept project completed in collaboration with Google Health, Carnegie Mellon, and dbMotion (a vendor of health care solutions), will be able to aggregate data throughout different UPMC settings and ultimately let both physicians and patients electronically share medical information with each other in a more efficient and secure manner.
A personal health record (PHR) commonly refers to an individual’s electronic health record that is initiated and maintained by the individual. Ideally, a PHR would gather data from many sources at once and provide a complete and accurate medical history of the individual. These data could later be accessed online, or by other means, by physicians, medical practitioners, and people who are granted access permission by the individual. A PHR is often confused with the more general electronic health record, which is generated and maintained within an institution, such as a hospital or clinic, but serves a similar purpose in the sense that it operates as a means to automate and streamline workflow within health care systems.
The new PHR system at UPMC is credited to the work of six candidates in the Master’s in the Information Systems Management (MISM) program at Carnegie Mellon’s Heinz College. Under the supervision of faculty member Rema Padman, a professor of management science and health care informatics, the team designed, implemented, and tested the system, ultimately revealing a demonstration of the project in the fall of 2009. Six weeks after starting the project, the system was capable of moving data through the dbMotion platform, populating the PHR component developed by Google Health, and passing the information back to the central UPMC system. Following its initial success, UPMC has announced that it plans to deploy this new system for use by its patients by this spring.
While the general public shows favor toward PHR systems, their development has been hindered by both the difficulty to unify all the technologies used within the health care setting under one universal platform and the lack of a standard way to present information that is readable and understandable by both patients and health care practitioners. dbMotion has developed a flexible, service-oriented, architecture-based interoperability platform, which is a system that will unify certain services under an agreed standard. Using this platform, the new PHR system at UPMC attempts to overcome existing problems by accepting data from all systems even with different formats. It will then organize this data into a format that can be easily understood by both doctors and patients, or others who need to read the report.
Despite the success of this system, there is still a great amount of work to be done in terms of the standardization of medical information industry-wide before it is effectively streamlined for use.

As more of our affairs can be managed online, privacy on the Internet becomes more of an issue. Research at Carnegie Mellon has centered on the idea of “privacy nudges,” which will give warnings when inputting personal information online. A team of professors — Lorrie Cranor, an associate professor of computer science; Alessandro Acquisti, an associate professor of information technology and public policy; and Norman Sadeh, a professor in the School of Computer Science — has combined computer science, economics, and psychology to create this solution.
The “privacy nudges” themselves can be presented in a variety of situations. For example, if a person is about to enter information on a website — whether it’s a name, a birthday, a photograph, a credit card, or a Social Security number — a message would come up warning the user that his or her information might be compromised if he or she continues. From that point, the user would decide whether or not to proceed.
Other examples include suggestions to change the default settings for a program or scanning an e-mail before sending it. In the latter example, the system scans the e-mail to find any indications that the e-mail might be considered a “flame,” — a kind of e-mail spam — withholds its sending, and at a later time asks if it should still be sent. As Acquisti describes it, nudges are “a shortcut, in a way,” to easier decision-making.
Acquisti’s main focus is on the “economics of privacy,” namely, combining psychology and classical economics to see how individuals act in regards to their personal privacy. This particular field contains some uncertainty, since there typically is a cognitive bias in which many mental factors specific to each individual play different roles in decision-making. From 2003 to 2007, Acquisti’s focus was on discovering behaviors in private decision-makers. “It was how we can explain [decision-makers’] biases, but it was also how we help people overcome their biases,” said Acquisti. “It was about pushing safe decision-making.”
From there, Acquisti described the merits of “soft paternalism,” which is when the government provides individuals with suggestions rather than regulations that they need to follow. He emphasized the importance of letting users select their own preferences when it comes to privacy.
Although the team favors individual preference in privacy settings, members acknowledge that certain governmental regulations, some suggested by Congress and the Federal Trade Commission, can be coordinated with the nudges in order to safeguard against the greatest number of potential privacy issues.
One of the dangers that Acquisti wishes to avoid is desensitizing the users to the warnings. If the “nudges” happen too often, the users will get annoyed and disregard them. When working on the project, Acquisti always asks himself, “When we design a new information system, how can we provide privacy to the user [without seeming insistent]?”
Other groups have also done research on privacy settings online. A group at Stanford University is focused on using human voices to give users verbal warnings, while a group at Princeton University is working to redesign the web browser completely.
Next in the process is more research on private behaviors in a number of different environments. Work is also being done on privacy regarding the location tracking service Locaccino, which allows users to share their location with their friends. In the meantime, the group awaits the approval of their National Science Foundation grant proposal. Google has funded the nudges; according to Acquisti, “They’re keeping their eyes very open to research in academia.”

Today, all computers have the same general structure. They have a processing core, where instructions are executed; some volatile memory, where data is temporarily stored; and non-volatile memory, where data can be stored over longer periods of time. Most computers have processors operating at around 50,000 million instructions per second (MIPS) and non-volatile memory of a few hundred gigabytes. This is significantly greater than the first personal computers, having a mere one MIPS processor, and the capability to store only five megabytes of data back in 1977.
Moore’s Law states that the number of transistors that can be placed on an integrated circuit will double every two years. There are some fundamental limits that will be approached eventually. The size of the transistors would approach those of molecules or even atoms eventually, and this would introduce elements of unpredictability into the circuit. As a result, scientists have decided to look for alternate methods of computing. DNA computing is one such alternate computing method that is catching on in certain scientific circles.
The structure of the DNA molecule was proposed by Nobel laureates James Watson and Francis Crick. It is a double-stranded helix, and the two strands are linked by base pairs in the center, which are held together by hydrogen bonds. There are four base pairs, A, T, C, and G, and they only connect as A-T and C-G. They are repeated millions of times on a single double-helix, and owing to the nature of the pairs, every base on one strand of the helix has a complementary base pair on the second strand. Base pairs are separated by a distance of 0.33 nanometers and, in two dimensions, will amount to over 1 million gigabits of data per square inch, over 2000 times greater than modern data storage systems. This is one of the reasons Leonard Adleman, a professor of computer science and molecular biology at the University of Southern California, proposed in a 1994 issue of the journal Science a new method of computing that involved using the DNA molecule. His proposal and its demonstration as a computing method to solve a seven-point Hamiltonian path problem (a special case of the Traveling Salesman Problem) brought DNA computing to the forefront of unconventional computing.
There are different ways in which a DNA computer can be built. On a basic level, all DNA computers function by pairing bases on the two strands and using certain enzymes to cut or splice the DNA molecules at different locations. The DNA computer can be thought of as having input data, hardware, and software molecules. These, when mixed together, react in specific ways to produce output molecules — or solutions — to a given problem. As of today, DNA computers may exist in test tubes or as DNA-based logic switches, much like the digital logic gates in modern computers. These may even be fully programmable. The main difference between conventional and DNA computing methods is the way instructions are executed. In conventional computers, data is processed sequentially, causing an increase in the time required to solve a problem. DNA computers process data in a parallel manner, thereby dramatically speeding up processes.
There are drawbacks that must be overcome before the DNA computer can become mass produced. DNA computers require some amount of human assistance, which increases the overall time to obtain a solution to a problem. Human interaction is necessary when combining the mixture of input, software, and hardware molecules, and a human must also interpret the output molecules. Furthermore, these computers, although capable of parallel processing, require amounts of DNA that are proportional to the complexity of the problem. This could result in extremely large and impractical quantities of DNA being used to solve equations having hundreds of variables. The DNA computer today, although programmable, only performs rudimentary functions, and significant advances have to be made before the execution of more complex functions.
In 2004, Ehud Shapiro of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel published the results of a study in Nature. He created a DNA computer capable of detecting disease in a patient. His study was performed in a laboratory with test tubes, and his work has not been tested on a real patient. Preliminary results seemed to point to his team’s DNA computer as a reliable approach to the early detection of diseases and cancers.
As DNA is abundant, there is no dearth of cheap, raw materials to manufacture these computers. They also use far less energy than traditional computers, according to National Geographic. While DNA computers may not be able to run operating systems, games, or spreadsheet applications, they show great potential for heavy data-crunching supercomputers. Their use would also mean a change in the understanding of computers as we know them.

Some may view aging as a curse; others see it as a sign of wisdom or a symbol of respect. One thing is for certain: The aging process is constant, ongoing, irreversible, and will affect everyone.
Aging in humans is commonly associated with a change in appearance, an increase in frailness, and a general loss of efficiency in bodily functions.
However, these external indications are the result of gradual changes in the cellular processes of our bodies.
One of the most noticeable changes in the body is the appearance of the skin. The skin is made of many different layers of cells. According to www.health-cares.net, skin cells divide more slowly with age, and an inner layer of skin called the dermis becomes thinner over time. In addition, a protein called collagen, which provides structural support, loses elasticity. Skin changes can be exacerbated with repeated sun damage. Ultraviolet rays, which bombard the skin during tanning or general sun exposure, work to weaken collagen. Other factors that affect collagen elasticity include cigarette smoke and ozone.
As we grow older, the amount of bone we produce decreases. Bones are made of many different kinds of cells. Although bones seem rigid, the old cells are constantly being replaced by new cells, but aging decreases the rate of replenishment, leading to frailer bones. According to an article on www.howstuffworks.com, bone loss can be aggravated by habits such as smoking, lack of certain nutrients such as calcium and vitamin D, and taking certain medications. However, while loss of bone strength is inevitable, it can be slowed through normal exercise and a non-sedentary lifestyle.
Getting shorter as we age is related to spongy disks between vertebrae in the spine, which lose water over time, causing a greater amount of compression. Becoming weaker is a result of deterioration of muscle tissue, causing decreased endurance, size, and strength. However, being inactive is a greater contributor to muscle weakening than aging is. 
Simple habits like regular exercise and good posture may reduce weakening of muscles over time.
The aging process also causes changes in the body’s metabolism, or the ability of the digestive systems to process food efficiently.
Older people generally have slower metabolisms than younger people, meaning that fat deposits are created more easily. This is why many older people seem to gain weight at a faster rate than their younger selves. Other factors may also be involved with weight gain. Becoming less active as we grow older can also accelerate weight gain. In addition, because people lose cells as they grow older, they expend less energy, but may still eat the same amount of food. However, an article on www.healthinaging.org notes that people who live in less technologically advanced societies do not show weight gain patterns, suggesting that an individual’s activity or eating habits, not the aging process, may be the direct cause of weight gain.
The heart also loses its effectiveness with age, decreasing the amount of blood that flows through the body. This causes people to feel colder and to take longer to recover from exercise.
While aging is a normal biological process, there are ways to remain healthy as we age and ways to slow the effects of aging. Research has shown that eating fruits and vegetables will supply the body with various nutrients that are necessary to maintaining normal functioning. According to www.dailycomet.com, berries supply the body with antioxidants such as vitamin C. These antioxidants are important because our bodies’ cells use oxygen to perform regular cellular processes, and free radicals are created as byproducts. Free radicals can damage the body slowly through a chemical reaction called oxidation. Over time, damage will build up. However, antioxidants can sequester free radicals so they are not harmful the body anymore.
While youth is often desired, with a healthy lifestyle, biological age can fall far behind chronological age.

Large Hadron Collider breaks own record
Last Friday, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) managed to accelerate two beams of protons up to 3.5 trillion electron volts, breaking its own previously set record. Last November, the LHC had accelerated particles up to 1.18 trillion electron volts, beating all records set by other particle accelerators.
CERN, the European institute that currently controls the LHC, has announced that it will try to cause two of the high-energy beams to collide with each other, producing an energy of 7 trillion electron volts. The particle accelerator will attempt to simulate the amount of energy and the events that happened during the Big Bang.
CERN plans to release a schedule of when it will carry out this collision soon. This collision will perhaps be the last high-energy collision in the LHC before it shuts down in 2012 for servicing and repair. The LHC will remain out of operation for around 18 to 24 months before it can resume working again.

Scientists show light can twist nanofibers
Researchers at the University of Michigan have discovered light is capable of twisting strings of nanoparticles. In the study published in the journal Science, nanoparticles of cadmium telluride were observed when kept in the light and when left in the dark. After 24 hours in the light, these particles formed long, flat ribbons. After 72 hours, the ribbons had twisted and had formed clumps. When the particles were kept in the dark, they formed flat ribbons but did not twist. The researchers have proposed that light causes the nanoribbons to twist by causing strong repulsion between the individual nanoparticles in the ribbon.
This discovery could have a number of applications in diverse fields. Light-controlled electromechanical systems could be created to help processes such as microchip assembly. Scientists are also studying the effect of light on other shapes of nanoparticle aggregates, such as spiral-shaped aggregates. If the spirals are able to rotate, they can be used for drug delivery into humans.

Mediterranean diet linked to fertility
Studies performed on couples undergoing fertility treatment showed that women who were on a Mediterranean-style diet had higher chances of getting pregnant. A Mediterranean diet contains large amounts of vegetables, vegetable oils, and fish — those on such a diet were 40 percent more likely to become pregnant than those who were not on a similar diet.
The study was conducted on 161 couples undergoing fertility treatment in the Netherlands and was published in the journal  Fertility and Sterility. The results were generated after the couples were asked to fill out questionnaires regarding their eating habits. Most women either had a Mediterranean-style diet or a health-conscious diet, which was high in fruits, vegetables, grains, fish, and beans. The study discovered that the health-conscious diet did not have a significant effect on the chances of pregnancy, but that the Mediterranean diet significantly increased chances of pregnancy.

For students and faculty members alike, Greek Sing is often acclaimed as the most anticipated event of the school year. This reputation has been rightfully earned, as the members of Carnegie Mellon’s various fraternities and sororities often dedicate hours upon hours of their time to building sets, learning songs, and choreographing dance routines to prepare for this stunning show. Aside from all of the glitz and glamour of Carnegie Mellon’s very own glimpse into Broadway, and the pride and joy that come with winning an award for one’s house, Greek Sing is an event with a noble purpose — all of the money earned through ticket sales and Greek-sponsored events is donated to a philanthropic cause chosen by the students.
This year, the Greek community decided to dedicate the record-breaking $38,000 earned to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. Because of donations like this one, St. Jude is able to provide free health care to children diagnosed with serious illnesses all across the United States. St. Jude is also making strides in cancer research. As the hospital’s representative stated in his student address, “our goal at St. Jude’s is get to a point where we, the staff, are all unemployed. We want to close our doors forever — we want to find a cure for cancer.”
Keeping their philanthropic mission in mind, the members of Carnegie Mellon’s various fraternities and sororities put on an unforgettable show. The Greek community also chose to dedicate their performances to recently passed Pi Kappa Alpha brother Matt Tembo, holding a moment of silence at the beginning of the show in his honor.
The first act of the show consisted of four singles acts, in which four fraternities chose to perform without a sorority house partner. Up first was singles third-place recipient Pi Delta Psi with a rendition of the 2008 musical tragicomedy film Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog. In the skit, Dr. Horrible, an aspiring supervillian, struggles to one-up his archnemesis Captain Hammer while simultaneously trying to attain the affection of their mutual love interest, Penny.
Second came Beta Theta Pi with an original show that can best be described as a cross-dressing rendition of a Jersey Shore and Bachelor hybrid musical. Although the fraternity did not receive any awards for the singles division because its performance lacked a key component — song — the men of Beta Theta Pi kept the audience in hysterics throughout their entire performance. After the Beta brothers came singles second-place recipient Sigma Tau Gamma with the house’s production of “The Night Man Cometh,” a musical adaptation of an episode of the FX sitcom It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Because the circumstances surrounding the performance were not properly explained with a script description or cited source, many audience members were confused as to what was going on with the plot. Regardless, seeing fraternity brothers sing about superheroes in giant baby and sun costumes was extremely entertaining, and the overall vocal quality of the performance was notably high.
Last but not least, singles first-place recipient Sigma Alpha Epsilon put on “*Titanic* (On Ice).” While many expected the brothers of Sigma Alpha Epsilon to roll out on roller skates or something of the sort, the audience was surprised to find that the show was “on ice” because instead of charting the journey of the various passengers aboard the Titanic, it instead told the story of the iceberg itself, which took on a particular likeness to Ariel of Disney’s The Little Mermaid. The performance was full of witty humor, talented singers, and a beautifully detailed set, which made it overall completely deserving of its first-place singles title.
After a brief intermission, the show continued with Act 2, the doubles performances. In these performances, various fraternities and sororities chose to team up — making for interesting vocal harmonies as well as larger, more intricate acts. Up first were the doubles third-place recipients Alpha Chi Omega and Alpha Epsilon Pi in their performance of Wicked, he celebrated retelling of The Wizard of Oz. The lead roles of Glinda and Elphaba were beautifully portrayed by the women of Alpha Chi Omega. Aside from incredible vocal talent, the performance also consisted of a positively dazzling set that made excellent use of props and stage space. Alpha Epsilon Pi also received the Chairman’s Choice Award, which is handpicked by the Greek Sing chairs and often understood to be the congeniality award for the sororities and fraternities involved in the event.
Doubles winners Kappa Alpha Theta and Pi Kappa Alpha performed next with their rendition of British jukebox musical Mamma Mia! Performing popular songs like “Dancing Queen” and “Mamma Mia,” the vocal performance of the Kappa Alpha Theta sisters and Pi Kappa Alpha brothers was extraordinary, appropriately earning them the winning trophy. “I thought the Theta/PiKA win was rightfully earned,” said first-year biology major Peggy Lees. “The girls did a fabulous job vocally and the dance numbers were really professional. I was so happy when they won.”
Next, Kappa Kappa Gamma and Sigma Phi Epsilon performed their rendition of the 1980 musical film Fame!, in which audiences follow the successes and failures of several students from New York City’s High School of Performing Arts. Although the show did not place, the set for Fame! was the most impressive of all of the doubles acts. Also, audiences couldn’t help but appreciate that in Kappa Kappa Gamma and Sigma Phi Epsilon’s version of the musical, the character Nick chooses to attend the “prestigious Carnegie Mellon University School of Drama” upon graduating from New York City’s High School of Performing Arts.
Delta Delta Delta and Delta Tau Delta managed to earn the doubles second-place prize for their performance of John Waters’ 1988 film-based musical Hairspray. Despite their performance being stopped abruptly due to what was described by an MC as a power outage, the groups managed to continue and put on a truly dazzling performance. Perhaps most notable was the likeness of the cross-dressing Delta Tau Delta actor playing Edna Turnblad to the role played by John Travolta in the popular 2007 film rendition of the musical. The costumes in this performance were especially impressive, and the audience couldn’t help but sing along with the Delta Delta Delta sisters and Delta Tau Delta brothers when they performed songs like “The Nicest Kids in Town” and “Mama, I’m a Big Girl Now.”
Last but not least, the sisters of Delta Gamma collaborated with the brothers of Phi Kappa Theta to put on their version of 1990’s Cry-Baby. The musical is similar to Jim Jacobs’ and Warren Casey’s Grease in that it tracks the relationship of a clean-cut girl and a bad boy. In the show, Baltimore teenager Allison Vernon-Williams falls in love with Wade “Cry-Baby” Walker and is drawn to his rowdy group of mischievous lowlifes. Possibly the best portrayal in the show came from Lenora, the schizophrenic bad girl who is seemingly and obsessively in love with Cry-Baby and willing to do anything to ruin his relationship with Allison. Although they did not place, Delta Gamma and Phi Kappa Theta were definitely crowd favorites — cheers from the audience could be heard throughout the performance.
Greek Sing is an opportunity for students to come together and recognize the efforts of our Greek community. It seems that all too often, the charitable efforts of the sorority sisters and fraternity brothers on campus are overlooked in favor of more controversial incidents. During performances as impressive as these, we are able to recognize the determination of our Greek students. All in all, Greek Sing was a night of great fun, good motives, and fabulous talent.

An unusually long rouge rug, a 13.5-inch man coated in gold, millions of dollars worth of diamonds all worn on a single neck: Can it mean anything other than the Oscars?   
This year, the film industry’s biggest night came on March 7 when the curtains of Hollywood’s Kodak Theatre opened and 10 nominees for Best Actor and Best Actress all stood on the stage.
After the talented 10 took their seats, Neil Patrick Harris emerged from behind the bandstand to carry out the opening number. The energetic song — “No One Wants to Do It Alone,” a song describing the night’s two hosts as opposed to the usual one — and performances by dancers with feathered fans and a Rockette-style line kick were charming, but lacked a wow-factor, and couldn’t live up to the previous year’s musical number by Hugh Jackman.
Following the musical number, the comedic duo of Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin arrived on stage. This pairing was a welcome change, because 1986 was the last time that more than one person hosted the show. The two hosts took jabs at each other, but most of the night was spent picking on the famous faces that were honored.
As hosts, they did exactly what they needed to do: allow those sitting in the chairs for 
almost four hours to enjoy themselves in between the occasionally drawn-out acceptance speeches. One example of their joviality involved Steve Martin mentioning “that damn Helen Mirren,” to which Alec Baldwin corrected him, “Dame Helen Mirren.”
There were no water-cooler moments and no promised revolutionary instances this year. Nonetheless, the show garnered 41.62 million viewers, a respectable increase from last year’s 36.94 million.
For the most part, though, the show was like every other year’s, where most people tune into what’s known as “The Big Five.” This quintet of awards includes Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay. (Fun fact: Only three films have won all five awards, delightfully dubbed the “Oscar Grand Slam.”) Awards like Best Documentary Short and Best Sound Mixing don’t hold viewers’ attention.
The award for Best Supporting Actor, going to Christoph Waltz for his role as “the Jew Hunter” in Inglourious Basterds, was not much of a shocker at all. His portrayal was consistently applauded.
The female category also hosted an actress expected to take home the prize: Mo’Nique. Her portrayal of a ruthlessly abusive mother hiding a horrifying story in Precious was met with acclaim from countless critics, and so it was no surprise when she took home the golden statue.
The film Precious was quite popular. Marshall Fine of the Huffington Post described the film as one “that doesn’t shy away from the depth to which human beings can sink.” Not all critics fell in love with the inspiring story, though. A writer for the Daily Telegraph described Precious as “a dispiriting mix of cliché and melodrama.”
Moving on to Best Actress, though all five nominees delivered stunning performances, there were two favorites: Meryl Streep and Sandra Bullock. Streep’s role in Julie and Julia was nothing short of her expected greatness; Bullock’s role, however, came among comedic and not-as-incredible portrayals. Thus, Bullock stood out more as an actress, and this, many critics feel, is why she ended up taking home the Oscar. Many also said that Meryl Streep didn’t need another Oscar to prove she’s talented; but others argued that if she is delivering time after time, why not reward her?
Similar to last year’s show, the nominees of the Best Actor and Actress category were announced and commended individually by past co-workers. This allowed all viewers and audience members to look at the potential winners as more than just great actors, but great people and friends as well.
Undoubtedly the biggest change of the night was in the most important category: Best Picture. Not since 1943 has the Best Picture category hosted 10 nominees. So what was the reason for the expansion? Sid Gannis, the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, stated in a press conference, “Having 10 Best Picture nominees is going to allow Academy voters to recognize and include some of the fantastic movies that often show up in the other Oscar categories, but have been squeezed out of the race for the top prize.”
Regardless of the number of nominees, there will only be two or three serious contenders. For example, Up was one of the most admired movies of the year; but just as everyone agreed it was terrific, everyone also agreed that it had almost no chance of winning the Oscar.
The public raved when Katherine Bigelow was seated just in front of James Cameron — not only were they the brains behind the two most nominated films of the night and the hottest contenders for dozens of awards, but they were once married. Is there a better way to send a message to an ex-husband than to take home the most important award in the industry? Bigelow did just this when The Hurt Locker took home the Oscar for Best Picture
And if you have contributed to the $2.64 billion gross of Avatar, you can most likely agree with this sentiment: so-so story, incredible special effects. Cameron postponed the movie until the necessary technology was available… if that’s not dedication to making the best film possible, what is?
So the great debate came down to whether or not a movie that surpassed the unsurpassable Titanic was worthy of a Best Picture award. There’s probably not a single viewer that could deny calling the visuals “breathtaking.” But is that enough? Its biggest rival was The Hurt Locker, which didn’t gain much nationwide attention until awards season. Even still, it only grossed $25.8 million, less than 10 percent of Avatar’s intake.
Immediately before the winner was revealed, The Hurt Locker’s Katherine Bigelow was handed another Oscar for Best Director. This marked a monumental moment, as she is the first female director to ever receive the award. Not since 2004 with Eastwood’s Million Dollar Baby has the Best Director also won the Best Picture.
Overall the Oscars was a night of great success and surprising new advancements. If you’re one of the millions of viewers who tuned it, you truly did witness Hollywood history.

“We’re all mad here.”  
The Cheshire Cat’s haunting words to Alice upon their first meeting aptly describe the incredible and insane world she has fallen into. However, though tea parties and amazing visuals were plentiful, madness seemed rather scarce in director Tim Burton’s version of the nonsensical classic.  
The film opened on March 5, and like some other recent productions such as Avatar, it was shown in 3-D. If you haven’t seen a recent movie in 3-D, it’s worth the $10.50 plus popcorn. Gone are the pink-tinted blurs of earlier films, and in its place are incredibly detailed graphics.  
Burton as the director of a goldmine of insanity such as Alice in Wonderland sounds like a recipe for a wonderful, crazy story. However, contrary to the hopes of many Lewis Caroll and Burton fans, the plot was neither enthralling nor unique.  
The premise of the plot is interesting in itself. The film combines two of author Caroll’s best-known works — Alice in Wonderland, and the poem The Jabberwocky — to create a coming-of-age quest in which an older Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returns to Wonderland, referred to as Underland in the movie, to find that the Red Queen (Helena Bonham-Carter) has taken over. In order to restore Underland to its usual barmy self, she must defeat the Queen’s horrible monster, the Jabberwocky.  
There was a conspicuous lack of the madness that makes Underland Wonderland, and not just another magical world Alice could have fallen into.  Wonderland is full of creatures and things so illogical that they seem to make sense in a roundabout way, a land of insanity with hidden wisdom and an appreciation for creativity. But although the visual effects and character designs gave the impression of a mad Wonderland, the plot did not.  
In Burton’s Alice in Wonderland, Alice was the “chosen one,” who ancient legend predicted would return to Underland to complete a quest and save the day. On her way, she is helped by the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, and other fantastic characters who are magical and entertaining, but seem to be more like magical helpers of other quest sagas. Because of this, Underland seems like just another magical world and Alice just another “chosen one” — as oxymoronic as that sounds. 
Throughout the movie, the Mad Hatter reminds Alice of the importance of imagining the impossible and appreciating madness, though he does not portray either of these qualities himself.
The special effects and the artistic care put into the Underland landscapes, as well as the costumes and the characters themselves, made this film visually inspiring and stunning to watch. Computer-generated characters such as the March Hare and the Jabberwocky were creatively designed, and human actors such as Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen looked like true citizens of Wonderland — the Queen was stark white with heavily darkened features, and the Mad Hatter was, well, mad-looking. 
Burton’s famed dark, almost-gothic style was evident in the style of the characters and Wonderland itself. However, though it was easy to identify his influence, this influence was not overpowering: Underand was not turned into a gothic cemetery.  
Although darker details and themes did seep into the crazy countryside, it made the movie distinctly Burton-esque; but thankfully, it did not turn Underland into Halloween Town. Burton, however, did not transform it into Wonderland, either. Instead, it seemed to be a magical world, full of visual wonders and impressive characters, but without the madness that made it a unique world of its own.

Maybe you don’t spend most Friday nights teleconferencing across the Atlantic with a 3-D-rendered cube-man showing you a series of short films created using video game engines. Or maybe you do. If you were at Friday night’s Machinima Film Festival, you certainly did.
“Machinima?” you say. Sounds like robot porn, or the internal mechanics of some sort of ancient device put on display. No, this machinima is a portmanteau of “machine-cinema” (with a misspelling, because who doesn’t love an extra “i”?). Since the late ’80s, the hacker art of creating film-like sequences through video games has found a home and a community through the world of machinima.
The wats:ON? Festival is a yearly event sponsored in the memory of Jill Watson. Watson was a Carnegie Mellon alumna and adjunct faculty member in the School of Architecture who was killed in a plane crash. This year’s focus was on virtuality. An Anthony McCall art installation, a talk by media archaeologist Erkki Huhtamo, and the work of Gordon Matta-Clark and Ernie Geer, as well as the Machinima Film Festival.
The film festival was held to give an introduction to an accessible virtual space. The films were constructed from common environments: the city streets of every car-racing game, the canyons of Halo, the bedrooms of The Sims. It is in these spaces that the filmmakers created their narratives, manipulating the familiar world of the video game.
And between these shorts, Friedrich Kirschner added his clever commentary. Kirschner, a machinimist himself, included (by request of the curators) one of his own works, person2184. The three-part series is a lushly shaded experience following a solitary individual who roams the streets of a dark, dystopian vision of a city of the future. Without being told, one would never expect that the film was created using the Unreal Tournament 2004 game engine, as Kirschner completely re-skinned the environment.
And while having your German host for the evening communicate with the audience over Skype may seem awkward, for this event it was perfect. His presence was brought to us through a character named Bob he controlled in real time. And with only a webcam to see the audience, he managed questions with a casual grace and an honest ability to get a room thousands of miles away to laugh.
The breadth of these films shows the potential for the future of the genre. Barriers to entry are low: All that is needed is a touch of creativity to add a suicidal slant to a future where humans are all connected to the network through unstoppable addiction, or to turn a flight simulator into slapstick-esque comedy. Machinima already has a yearly festival with its own awards, but as video games increase in their reach, this subversive art is only given more room to grow.

The following is an account of one student’s adventure through Europe over winter break.
Dec. 29 (Budapest, Hungary):
Overnight trains are very difficult to enjoy without a sleeper. Border patrol at 5 a.m., the extreme heat of the Romanian trains, and the lack of leg room can get on a person’s nerves. My friend Jae and I got to the station at around 10 a.m. Budapest time. Our smartest decision at the train stations was to buy a 24-hour transport pass; all day we hopped on and off the metro and tram lines only caring about our next destination. It was also a nice feeling having the local currency on hand. We took the metro, which had only three lines, and the tram to our hostel. In some locations, like at Heroes’ Square, you go down approximately 15 stairs and there is the metro platform! It was very accessible — if only London’s metro was similarly convenient. The Budapest Opera House was splendid inside — adorned with gold everywhere. I think that was my first time in an opera house, and it was everything I had come to imagine. I kept placing the characters from Jane Austen’s Persuasion, Anne and Frederick, in the audience or Edmond Dantès in one of the boxes using the opera as a social opportunity. My favorite part of the opera house tour was the historical connection. The opera house was built in the Austro-Hungarian empire, and the ruling family based in Vienna demanded a less-grand opera house be built in Budapest so as not to compete with Vienna’s own city theater. The tour guide said that the Budapest Opera House was more beautiful but smaller. Jae and I joked among ourselves that we would have to go to Vienna to compare — and we actually did.
New Year’s Eve (Vienna, Austria):
The New Year’s celebration in Vienna was so active and exciting. We started our Old Town tour at St. Stephen’s Basilica, the most prominent building in the area. As a unique tradition for New Year’s in Vienna, every vendor sold items related to pigs: miniatures, statues, pins, and hats. There were 11 stages spread out over the old town for entertainment, and people, mostly older couples, celebrated by dancing near the stage front — congo lines were spontaneously being formed. Pig hat aficionados gathered for pictures and laughs, mothers boogied with their children, and young folk felt the rhythms of new-age music DJs. Something I found unexpected was the overwhelming number of American songs being played, for example Train’s “Stand By Me.” I liked the freedom of breaking into dance, walking with a beat, acting easy and blending in with others who were full of only joy on that festive night. I was struggling to learn new German words — I had asked a few times how to say “happy new year,” but I still can’t remember how. Walking through the streets of the Old Town was beautiful. The path of celebrations was denoted by lights and banners above the pavement. Fireworks were set off everywhere and I couldn’t avoid thinking of home during this night. I was frustrated that I didn’t know the words to “Auld Lang Syne,” but my friend Stanley and I decided to whistle along all night.
Jan. 2 (Vienna, Austria):
One positive thing about traveling is that one learns how one interacts with various people. In museums, do you walk behind other viewers or quickly in front of them? Do you let someone in front of you in the queue or feel like you’ve “earned” that spot? Do you welcome unexpected conversations with a band of peaceful protesters against destroying a park? Do you have the patience to withstand hours of, in my mind, unnecessary photography? I hear traveling is a way to becoming more aware of yourself, and that notion of exploring the world is a Western mindset.
Jan. 3 (Salzburg, Austria):
Sliding down snow banks on the only sled I had — my back — lightened my spirits. The untainted snow in Salzburg tasted like carrots somehow, a sweet tinge to the snow that clung to fences and leaves.
Jan. 7 (Ceský Krumlov, Czech Republic):
Early rise, prepare a to-go breakfast, say goodbye to my friend Ping, and run to catch our bus to Ceský Krumlov. Jae walked fast and got us to the station on time. After a three-hour bus journey, we made our way to the Old Town and had a traditional Chinese lunch. We watched the town Christmas tree get taken down, de-limbed, and chopped up. This was quite funny to watch as tourists in a quaint town. We relaxed here because we had a lot of time before sunset and not much to see since we had missed a few tours already. Walking around the town was exciting. Cobblestones and little alleyways, monastery gardens, and brightly painted houses filled Ceský Krumlov. Red roofs and snow were everywhere. There was a castle up on a hill that was surrounded by a bear moat. (The bears were indoors today). The castle was decorated, not with actual stonework or sculptures, but with painted imitations. The walls were painted with images of stone, detailing, shadows, frescoes, and exterior siding. From afar the effect was believable, but from up close it was simply hilarious. The painters even changed the direction of the shadows on the “stones” for actual lamp positions. We walked through the castle and out the other side, arriving at a large field. My friend Stanley said that it reminded him of China, but to me it was the Pennsylvanian countryside — small field, trees, and small rounds. The days passed like this: “Oh that street looks exciting and new — do we know where it goes?” “No, does it matter?” “No.” “Okay, let’s go!” “Oh, wait. Let me take a photo first.” 
There is nothing like touring Europe.

Fashion Week for fall/winter 2010 wrapped up in Paris just recently. Continuing the trend from New York and London, many designers put out fantastic work in Milan and Paris. Here are some favorites from the show.
Milan
Milan’s fashion week lasted four days, which is a lot shorter than usual, and Anna Wintour was the source of the issue. For those who don’t know Wintour, she is the editor-in-chief of American Vogue and commonly referred to as one of the most influential executives in the fashion industry. Wintour is easily recognized as the inspiration for Miranda Priestly, the cold fashion industry icon from the book and movie The Devil Wears Prada. Wintour unexpectedly announced that she would be shortening her stay at Milan to four days due to her scheduled appearance at the Oscars. Organizers scrambled to accommodate Wintour, squeezing over a hundred shows and presentations into just four days. However, both Fendi and Prada chose to keep their shows on Thursday, the fifth day, regardless of Wintour’s absence. Critics praised these lines for this gutsy move, and the designers were rewarded for their independence when Wintour made an unexpected appearance at both of their shows. Silvia Venturini, one of the creative designers for Fendi, stated in an interview with wtop.com after her show that “you have to believe in what you are worth.”
Fendi featured its trademark fur as one of the primary accessories for the upcoming fall season. Karl Largerfeld, artistic director of Fendi, reinvented the winter 2010 line with more modern and futuristic characteristics. The colors of the collection were earthy — navy, cream, and mustard were featured in several garments. However, the line also showed some hyped feminine characteristics such as high-waist hems. In contrast with Fendi, Prada’s show gave a sense of nostalgia. Rather than following the trend of thin and skinny, Miuccia Prada celebrated women’s curves and unveiled new, voluptuous clothing. That being said, Prada seemed to have taken a more conservative approach to her line, and some thought it to be less innovative.
Versace toughened things up with leather. Biker chic dominated the show as the catwalk featured leather coats combined with wool, fur, and metallic leather minis and skirts. Rather than sticking to signature prints, Versace put out a new collage of leather, tweed, and other materials. Although the line felt industrial at times, it was certainly full of vibrant energy.
One of the notable accessory designers from Milan was Salvatore Ferragamo. Ferragamo, a well-known Italian shoemaker, custom-made many shoes for Hollywood stars — including Greta Garbo — back in the day. Right before Milan Fashion Week, in collaboration with the Ferragamo company and relatives of Garbo, the designers put up an exhibition dedicated to Garbo’s films, photographs, clothing, and accessories. An avid Ferragamo fan, Garbo owned over a hundred pairs of his shoes. During Fashion Week, Ferragamo featured designs inspired by Garbo in the fall collection.
**Paris
In comparison to Milan Fashion Week, Paris was not forced to face dramatic changes and ran quite smoothly. Notably, Stella McCartney, Celine, and Chloe all featured a chic-minimalist look in their lines. The designers showed clean-cut, modern, and sensual collections. A palette of beige, gray, black, and navy dominated their runways. Stella McCartney featured V-neck tunics and skinny wool pants, sleeveless wool coats, mini-shifts, and graphic uses of neutral colors. Similarly, Celine showed navy slim-dresses with tiepin collars, clean-cut shirts, and leather-lapel coats. Chloe created camel-colored pieces, slouchy skirts, and classic school coats. All of the clothes produced by these designers were practical and were pieces that real women would want to wear. Although the clothes were kept at a minimal, the designers accentuated their lines with quirky details.
Chic-minimalist contrasted greatly with the futuristic Nicolas Ghesquière at Balenciaga. Ghesquière’s line was inspired by technology. He used materials that were hard to identify; some appeared to be coated in plastic while others resembled packing materials. Jackets were printed with words in primary colors as if they could be posters on the side of a street. Another bold designer, Pierre Balmain, featured lots of gold lace and black suits in his line.
Fashion Week also made a notable attempt to ease skinny model stereotypes. Marc Jacobs decided to cast plus-size models for his Louis Vuitton collection. Bar Rafaeli, Alessandra Ambrosio, and Adriana Lima walked the runway wearing silhouettes that highlighted their womanly curves. It was nice to see some real women figures on the runway.
All in all, Fashion Week in Milan and Paris was full of drama. However, the clothing produced was, as always, exhilarating.

The last album the Shins released was 2007’s Wincing the Night Away. Since then, the band has gone through lineup changes and has moved labels, jumping to lead singer James Mercer’s private label, Aural Apothecary. While it was rumored that a new album might be released in 2009, nothing has surfaced yet. With everything on pause, a side project was bound to happen.
The first time Mercer and Brian Burton, better known as Danger Mouse, worked together was on the song “Insane Lullaby,” a track based on alternative rock band Sparklehorse’s project Dark Side of the Soul. It really comes as no surprise when the duo announced in September 2009 that they would be collaborating to form a new band called Broken Bells.
Some have compared Broken Bells to The Postal Service, citing similarities between Ben Gibbard and Mercer, as both used their side projects to experiment with electronic sound.
On first listen, their self-titled debut sounds fresh and unique, with soulful harmonies and captivating beats. The sound is reminiscent of the Beatles, but with the band’s own quirks. “The High Road,” their first single and the first track on the album, features skipping beats and synthetic punches, which are echoed throughout many of the other nine songs on the album.
“Vaporize,” the next track, begins with a few chords on acoustic guitar, which is later joined by Mercer’s voice, an organ, percussion, and bass. As with the next track on the album, “Your Head Is On Fire,” and a later track, “Citizen,” it pulls from Mercer’s other band and could probably pass for a song by the Shins.
From there, the middle tracks don’t quite parallel the first two in excitement or fascination. It isn’t until “October,” a song with a catchy, upbeat tempo propelled by an electric keyboard, that the album wakes up again. The album concludes with “The Mall and the Misery,” which starts with a fast drum beat, followed by techno-electronic sounds. 
Perhaps the best way to describe the album is that, with the exception of a few songs, everything merges into one. It’s hard to notice, especially while multitasking, when the songs change. Although Broken Bells is pleasant to listen to, and definitely worth a listen, it’s nothing to write home about.
A few boundaries were pushed, as Mercer uses his voice in a higher register, but there seems to be no new growth for the duo. While the album as a whole is captivating, nothing in the album stands out.
Perhaps the duo didn’t have enough time to experiment more, or maybe the project was just a distraction for Mercer as he moves past his losses and tries to find his way. It would seem that way when one peruses the lyrics, especially as he describes in “The High Road”: “Cause they know, and so do I/The high road is hard to find/A detour to your new life/Tell all of your friends goodbye.”

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I fly Southwest, and every time I’m getting on my plane to Pittsburgh, there are tons of really smoking hot girls on the flight who go to Pitt, Point Park, and sometimes even Carnegie Mellon! The flight has open seating; do I just sit next to a girl? What if one sits next to me?
—Miles higher
Dear Miles,
This is one of the most troubling social questions to date, and one Brian and I have discussed extensively on our own flights. The three different boarding groups (A, B, and C) each have different kinds of girls, and you need to put yourself in the position to find the one that is right for you. Any passenger in the A group is going to be really conscientious. Who else would take the time to confirm their flight at exactly the right time? The B girls are going to be laid-back types, and the C girls are going to be complete flakes who forgot they even had a flight.
As the different groups get on the plane, you need to position yourself in the right boarding group. The optimal choice is to be in the mid- to late-B range so you can nonchalantly sit anywhere. When you get there, be sure to strike up a conversation immediately. Don’t worry about messing up; she can’t walk away from you at 30,000 feet!
Fly closer to the sun,
—Patrick Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I met this girl and we really hit it off, but I haven’t had a chance to talk with her since! I only ever bump into her at the entrance to our building, and I hold the door for her to get in. She always seems happy to see me. How do I go from opening the door to opening her heart?
—Patiently awaiting talking time with you
Dear P.A.T.T.Y.,
First things first, you need to be sure your door-opening sends the right message. Don’t open the door too soon; it seems way too needy. If you have to, slow down when you know she’s walking behind you to ensure good door arrival time. Also, open the door to an angle between 90 and 85 degrees. Over 90 and she’ll think you’re a pushover. Under and you seem a little less interested. 
Next, after letting her through, be sure to walk beside her, not behind her, down the hall. Since your entire relationship seems to be door-centered, try and use that shtick to start talking. Ask her if she knows how to open a door or, for that matter, tie her shoes, call elevators, or pump gas (Jersey girls only). It’s important that you develop an inside joke with her and form some sort of history. 
That ought to put your foot in the door,
—Brian Hoskins

In a response to a $25,000 prize offered by Andrew Carnegie to create a heavier-than-air flying machine, it is noted that eight students have succeeded in the challenge. Whoopee, a flying machine? What will they ever think of next?

A letter to the editor insists that chivalry is not dead at Carnegie Mellon. A lass who recently got stuck in bad weather was aided by “the Tech gentry” who rolled her car out of the snow. Not exactly risking your life for your love, but we’ll take what we can get at this university.

The Ice Tartans were beaten this past week in ice hockey by the Duquesne Dukes, 6–1, in a playoff game. Well, neither school even has a non-club hockey program today, so it looks like solving the Tartans’ goal-tending problems didn’t really matter in the long run.

An article boasts that the Student Dormitory Council apparently changed the meal plan for the upcoming semester, getting rid of meal blocks and substituting them with what they are calling “value meals.” Well, since we still have blocks, it looks like Carnegie Mellon is a flip-flopper on this issue.

A Forum article decries the unrealistic standards and poor body image that are promoted by reality TV shows. As a skinny person myself, I can agree with the writer that these notions are overrated and that you should definitely partake in a delectable hamburger.

A Pillbox article goes over some ways to alleviate the stress that comes with diving back to school after spring break. Want another way? Just stay where you were, because you were probably a much happier person in that place than you ever were here. Not to be negative, of course.

In today’s culture of bombastic beats and heavy synthetic drones, lyrics are going by the wayside in popular music, and bass is speaking in ways language never could. Words now are chosen more for their cadence than their emotive value, and while I enjoy the refrain from songs like Lady Gaga’s “Bad Romance,” enough is enough. This dance music trend needs to stop.
At its best, bass-driven dance pop is a primal and visceral experience; at its worst, it’s a cheap way to entertain college drunks. The synthetic groan of a bitcrusher may be great in the heated sweat of the dance floor, but dance pop rarely resonates beyond the confines of the club. The experience is too electronic; it lacks a human element: lyrics.
Dance raves are great if you’re European, but Americans listened to Bruce Springsteen long before they had heard of DJ Shadow. From The King to the Beatles to Bob Dylan, music’s poetic lyricism has long been a force of social change and internal exploration, and no recent music has had more effect than Dylan’s “The Times, They Are a-Changin’.”
Make no mistake, the world is full of talented electronic artists. On St. Patrick’s Day, I experienced electronic music at its finest with STS9 performing at Mr. Small’s Theatre. Critics are right: STS9 is “making electronic music relevant again,” and I was happy to see a strong Carnegie Mellon presence at the concert. People — artists and listeners alike — just need to delve into the lyrics as much as the beats. It is as simple as listening to Radiohead merge abstract lyrics with electronic dissonance. And if you’re looking for something new, try exploring the lyrics of Matt Berninger as he sings for The National. No one conveys the looming potential of loss better than he does:
“We expected something, something better than before. We expected something more / Do you really think you can just put it in a safe behind a painting, lock it up and leave / Do you really think you can just put it in a safe behind a painting, lock it up and leave / Walk away now and you’re gonna start a war.”

Carnegie Mellon lost one of its former students on March 6. Matthew Tembo, 22, was a student at Carnegie Mellon during the 2007–2008 academic year, and was most recently a student at the University of Pittsburgh in Greensburg.
Michael Murphy, the vice president of Campus Affairs, sent an official communication to the campus community in response to Tembo's death. "While Matt was a student here for a short time, he was widely connected across campus and within the fraternity and sorority community, in particular. He was involved with his fraternity's buggy program as a pusher and a mechanic," Murphy wrote. "Among his many activities, he especially loved soccer, both as a player and a fan. Matt's friends describe him as personable and outgoing, making and maintaining friendships easily, with a genuine nature and sincerity that endeared him to others."
Tembo was at Carnegie Mellon's Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house on Morewood Avenue for a birthday celebration on March 6, when he died after “likely drinking too much,” said city police detective Christine Williams at a press conference two weeks ago. Edward Strimlan, chief forensic investigator for the Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office, found the death to be the result of ethanol poisoning after performing an autopsy on March 8. "This is the report commonly associated with those who die from drinking too much," Strimlan said, adding that the death was "ruled an accident."
The Health Services websites of both the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon offer information about what to do in case of an alcohol emergency. Carnegie Mellon offers amnesty to any student who calls University Police or Emergency Medical Services regarding an intoxicated student, as well as offering the same policy to those who stay with the intoxicated student until help arrives. 
"Pitt has alcohol awareness programs in place both on its Oakland campus and in Greensburg, as well as counseling services available through the Office of Student Affairs to assist students who are experiencing any sort of alcohol problems," Pitt spokesman John Fedele told The Pitt News. "Counseling services are available for friends or any other students having trouble coping with the tragedy as well." At Carnegie Mellon, Counseling and Psychological Services is also available to any students affected by Tembo's death.
"The dangers of the use of alcohol are clear," Murphy said. "It is critical for all students to call Campus Police whenever a friend may be at risk. They can be assured that the response will be supportive, not punitive, consistent with our concern for the welfare of all students."

Over the past week, nine chickens were found across campus. The chickens were found alone, some deposited in paper bags, malnourished, and apparently painted. Carnegie Mellon University Police arranged for the chickens to be transported to the Wildbird Recovery sanctuary north of the city.
Stanley Krowitz, the University Center’s evening business manager, described the first bird sighting as quite a spectacle. Between Wean and Kirr Commons in the UC, “there was a reddish rooster ... with families and kids around saying ‘Oh, look at the cute chicken.’ ” With the help of others in the UC, Krowitz was able to temporarily hold the chicken, and one other bird found in the racquetball courts, in standard-issue Carnegie Mellon cardboard recycling receptacles.
Beth McMaster, who owns the Wildbird Recovery center where the birds are staying, has been forthcoming with police and the local media, asking for those who did this to be prosecuted. While initial local news reports seemed to indicate that Carnegie Mellon would be handling this situation entirely internally, The Tartan has been told that is not the case.
Michael Murphy, vice president for Campus Affairs and interim dean of Student Affairs, spoke with The Tartan by phone Friday. He stated that after the internal process was completed the administration would then “engage the right outside agency,” adding, “If it does need to result in some formal external notification, it will be done.”
Murphy wanted to acknowledge that although this is an incident that many people are very interested in, the university’s policy is to not discuss “the details of the situation until we have completed the investigation and decided what judicial action is warranted.”
A number of student groups, the Office of Student Life, and University Police declined comment, as the investigation is currently ongoing.
Murphy said that this is not the last we will hear about the chickens. “I think this will all come out, speaking about the situation with the chickens,” he said. “We will be fully disclosing, ultimately, when we do know all the facts.”
This disclosure is what some like McMaster are looking for, regardless of the effect it may have on some students’ lives if they are criminally prosecuted. The Western Pennsylvania Humane Society told TribLive that the students involved could face up to $750 in fines and 90 days in jail for animal cruelty.
Krowitz wants a more thoughtful approach taken if students are involved, “There are things you don’t allow, but you don’t just crucify them...,” he said.  “You need to understand the root of the problem.” And certainly he wishes to understand how these hens ended up in the University Center on his watch, telling The Tartan, “That was the craziest Saturday I have had in 10 years.”
If anyone has any information about the chickens, they should contact University Police. As details continue to be uncovered, check thetartan.org for updates.

After over a full year of health care debate, the House of Representatives passed the Senate's version of health care reform late Sunday night, 219–212.
In a speech given by President Barack Obama just after the passage of the bill, he described the bill as a "reform package finally worthy of the people we were sent here to serve." The speech he gave served to confirm to the American people that the promises he ran behind are coming to fruition. "This is what change looks like," he said.
Obama described the House decision as "not a victory for any one party.... It's a victory for the American people. And it's a victory for common sense." 
However, it seems clear based on the vote counts this is truly a victory for the Democrats. It is their party, their leaders, and their majority in Congress that, eventually, allowed the bill to clear the House. House Minority Leader John Boehner (R–Ohio) stated that the bill was in "defiance of our citizens."
Following clear party lines, not a single Republican voted in support of the bill.
While Sunday's historic vote can be seen as decisive progress, the legislation is not yet complete. Apart from passing the bill that the Senate passed on Christmas Eve, the House also passed Sunday night a package of "fixes" that now needs to be returned to the Senate for approval. This process, called reconciliation, would align the differences between the House and Senate bills, in most cases siding with the Senate version or compromising between the two.
If the reconciliation package were to be passed in the Senate, the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 would come into law, taking effect in 2014. Under the law, approximately 95 percent of legal U.S. residents under the age of 65 would have health coverage, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).
The CBO projected that the bill would cost approximately $940 billion, but it would reduce the federal deficit by $138 billion over 10 years when taking into account savings from Medicare and other programs.
For more information on comparisons between the House bill, Senate bill, and the reconciliation package passed by the House, see www.pbs.org/newshour/interactive/static/stories/healthcare-comparison.html.
Check back for updates on the campus's response to the passing of the health care reform.

Carnegie Mellon students have collaborated to spread educational opportunities from the Pittsburgh and Qatar campuses, across the globe, to Rwanda — developing a two-week summit for elementary school children. 
Four students from Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh campus are responsible for the creation of the summit: Amy Badiani, a junior international relations and policy and management double major; Sruthi Reddy Chintakunta, a junior electrical and computer engineering major; Joshua Debner, a junior electrical and computer engineering major; and Ariel Solomon, a sophomore business administration major. 
The summit is scheduled to take place this summer from May 11 to May 22 in Kigali, Rwanda.
The initiative will be in line with the work of the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) Association, a national non-profit organization whose mission is to create educational opportunities for the world’s poorest children. The organization is currently based in the United States and is set up to oversee the creation of an affordable educational device for use in developing countries. In their efforts to do so, the company decided to focus on the development, construction, and deployment of an innovative laptop called the XO-1. 
Previously known as the “$100 laptop,” the computers are rugged, low-cost, low power, and pre-installed with software designed to foster collaborative, self-empowered learning. OLPC will assign the group of Carnegie Mellon students to an elementary school in the Rwandan capital where the students have already been given laptops.
The project team was formed due to the efforts of senior business administration major Sasha Urquidi and junior electrical and computer engineering major Rohith Salim through their work for Students In Free Enterprise (SIFE). 
The two upperclassmen connected with the other four students to initiate a dialogue concerning the creation of a service project in Rwanda, eventually creating an interdisciplinary project that hopes to make education for Rwandan children more than just a luxury.
The project has received a positive reaction from many students. “Rwanda is in dire need of innovative educational policy,” said Aderinsola Akintilo, a first-year information systems major from Nigeria. “Many children will not even have access to books, so if the program can teach children how to use computers, then I think it is fantastic.”
“For us, inspiration and empowerment are key,” explained Badiani, who is heavily involved in the initiative. 
“We would like to unleash the creativity and spark we know these children have, whether that be through art projects, class discussions, presentations, or team building and leadership workshops.”
The group of four will be joined by six students from Carnegie Mellon’s campus in Qatar for the summit in Kigali. Badiani emphasized that one of the projects goals was to “strengthen ties between both campuses.” 
The group also welcomed other passionate students to join the team for their trip to Kigali. Students who were interested in the project were encouraged to complete an application process that involved an interview. 
The project has room for two more students and decisions will be sent out on Wednesday.
“While we have developed this project, we would like for our new selected team members to contribute to, further develop, and help refine it, so we are definitely still open to fresh ideas,” said Solomon, speaking about her excitement at the prospect of adding to the group.
One of the long-term goals of the project is sustainability. The team has often stressed their desire to be able to contribute beyond just the summit.
“We are trying to make the project sustainable by keeping contact with the students in Rwanda through video conferences and letter writing. This way, you don’t have to go on the trip; you can act locally,” Chintakunta said.
Editor's note: Amy Badiani and Sruthi Reddy are junior staffwriters for The Tartan. Joshua Debner is a member of The Tartan photo staff.

“Thanks for coming in on the most beautiful day we’ve had in a while. I arranged spring for you, so you see what kind of caring president I am.” With this statement, Jared L. Cohon, the president of Carnegie Mellon University, began his speech at the Carnegie Mellon Student Senate meeting last Thursday.
Cohon, who spoke as part of the Student Senate’s Spotlight Speaker Series, maintained his good humor as he talked about a number of topics. He addressed Carnegie Mellon’s recent land acquisition, the loss in endowment due to the economy, and the university’s role as an international institution, along with various day-to-day issues.
“The thing I would say we’ve been working on for at least 20 years is improving the undergraduate experience. We still work harder than any student body in history, no doubt about it,” Cohon said, drawing smiles from his audience. “The stress level is too high, but we’re not going to change the challenges of our program. What we continue to do is find ways to support you, to reduce stress, to make sure you feel supported and that you know how to get help when you need it. And that you do get help when you need it.”
Cohon then opened the floor to questions from the Senators, beginning with a question about Carnegie Mellon’s transfer student community. “We make it very hard for students to transfer here,” Cohon said in response to a question on why the transfer class at Carnegie Mellon was so small. “We have to get each department to accept transfers, and maybe because of our unusual programs, it’s very hard to get them to accept them. But there is room for more transfer students here.”
One question in particular — about how the recent deaths in the campus community have affected the outside perception of Carnegie Mellon — seemed to rattle Cohon. Speaking haltingly, Cohon said, “The two deaths were terrible and should not have happened. We as an administration have learned as much as we can from them to try and avoid that happening again. With regards to public perception, it is a problem. These things matter. But I don’t think people think that way about Carnegie Mellon. I think they see stories like that as atypical.”
However, Cohon’s speech ended on a positive note. “We’re very proud of our student body here,” he said. “They’re a talented, brilliant, determined bunch.”
Speaking after the event, students had mixed reactions concerning the question and answer session.
Stephanie Schneider, a sophomore Senator representing the Tepper School of Business, said, “I think it was more about bringing things to his attention, but I don’t know that this was a perfect venue to go into detail about any of these things. But as Student Senators, we just want to get the ideas out there.”
Alex Blair, a junior Senator representing the Science and Humanities Scholars program, pressed Cohon on Carnegie Mellon’s units system, and summarized his question after the event. 
“The discrepancy is between the number of units and the number of hours that the student actually has to spend working,” he said. “I think you could reduce the workload and still maintain rigor.”
However, in response to Blair’s concern, Cohon said, “Life at Carnegie Mellon will never be perfect, and if the first thing that comes to mind is working harder, for more hours than you’re getting credit for, that’s both fixable and not too terrible.”
“This isn’t the place to get solutions,” Blair said. “I think that’s why he threw it back at me.”
“Sometimes it’s hard to ask the person on top about stuff because he doesn’t always know the details of things,” said Thomas Tuttle, a junior Senator from the School of Computer Science. “But I think it was fine.”
Tuttle was more enthusiastic when speaking about the event in general. “I think it was really nice that [Cohon] came here and just talked to students. He’s a lot more approachable than most people in his position.”

Students entering Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall may have been surprised to see a large black sheet of plastic covering half of the main stairway, coupled with a sign declaring the presence of asbestos.
Asbestos is a naturally occurring fiber that can be woven and is resistant to heat and most chemicals. For these reasons, in the mid-20th century, asbestos was considered ideal for use in construction-related applications, including roofing shingles, ceiling and floor tiles, paper and cement products, textiles, and coatings. However, the inhalation of asbestos fibers can cause serious illnesses, including lung cancer and asbestosis, a type of lung ailment. Since Jan. 1, 2005, the European Union has banned all use of asbestos as well as banning all extraction, manufacture, and processing of asbestos products.
According to Carnegie Mellon Environmental Health and Safety (EHS), all of the hard plaster in Margaret Morrison is considered to be contaminated with asbestos. For this reason, any repair or renovation that would disrupt the building’s hard plaster has to be completed by a contractor licensed by the Allegheny County Health Department.
The current work being undertaken in Margaret Morrison is a result of water damage that occurred earlier this year. “[Facilities Management Services] knew of the presence of asbestos in the building and incorporated the need for asbestos abatement work from the very beginning of its planning of [the water damage repair] project,” said Mark R. Banister, assistant director of EHS. “The abatement work is being performed under a permit from [the] Allegheny County Health Department, who oversees all asbestos abatement work in the county. Our contractor is licensed by them.”
Many students reacted negatively to hearing of the asbestos problem. “I was really surprised to see that there was asbestos in the building.” said Sarah Ceurvorst, a first-year art major. “I only have class there twice a week, but I still don’t want to be breathing that in, even for a short time. I feel bad for the staff and students who spend most of their time inside the building.”
However, Banister also stresses that asbestos, when properly handled, does not pose any health risk. This is especially true in Margaret Morrison, where asbestos is only present in the back side of the plaster and is not exposed unless the material is damaged. According to Banister, health risks are also low during the current repairs due to the steps taken by the health department. “County personnel inspect the completed work before the barriers are removed and also review the air test results to ensure safe re-occupancy of the area,” Banister said. “The barriers that one sees from the outside are designed to prevent any asbestos fibers from leaving the work area. Filtered vacuum units run within the work area to also ensure that no contamination leaves the area.”
Students enrolled in classes taking place in Margaret Morrison have not had to change their routes significantly thanks to a second stairway only a few feet away. However, many students have voiced complaints concerning the quality of the repair efforts. “I was surprised to see that the areas of the walls that had been repaired didn’t look nice at all. The color doesn’t match the rest of the walls, and in some places the drywall hasn’t been replaced,” said Sarah Read, a first-year design major.
In addition to Margaret Morrison, two other Carnegie Mellon buildings contain materials contaminated with asbestos. In the boiler room of Morewood Gardens, the ceiling contains asbestos, and on the fourth floor of Hunt Library, there is asbestos fireproofing above the suspended ceiling in the center above and around the rare book room. No one is permitted to lift the ceiling tiles in this area.
While the presence of asbestos may make some students nervous, EHS and FMS are dedicated to keeping Carnegie Mellon’s campus and buildings safe for students and faculty. According to Banister, the departments’ detection measures, as well as their commitment to repairing any risky areas, will keep campus free of asbestos-related health risks. 
“We maintain an inventory of all asbestos locations on campus and monitor them routinely for damage or deterioration. Whenever such conditions occur, we take prompt action to repair or remove the material in question.”

Eight Carnegie Mellon students experienced life on our Qatar sister campus this spring break. The students traveled to the Carnegie Mellon campus in Doha, Qatar to spend their time immersing themselves in its culture, acquainting themselves with the student body there, and developing ways to bridge the gap between the Qatar and Pittsburgh campuses.  
“It definitely was the best trip I’ve ever experienced,” said Tarik Raed, a junior business administration major and one of this year’s participants.
The trip is part of the Carnegie Mellon Initiating Meaningful Pittsburgh and Qatar Ties (IMPAQT) program, sponsored by the Qatar Foundation and the Division of Student Affairs at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh. The Qatar Foundation is a privately chartered nonprofit organization founded in Qatar in 1995 by Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. The foundation funds education, science, and community development initiatives, and was the enabling force behind the formation of Education City, the collection of Qatar campuses of which Carnegie Mellon is a part.
Founded in fall 2008, the IMPAQT program sends eight students to the campus each spring break to strengthen Pittsburgh’s relationship with the Qatar community. Throughout the trip, the students learn all they can and bring it back to Pittsburgh in the form of cross-campus collaboration projects.
To learn about the culture of Qatar, the students were encouraged to completely immerse themselves within the local community.
“While there, we took part in QALTA, which can be equated to CMU-Pittsburgh’s Summit, except it takes place after spring break,” said Eda Akyar, a junior Science and Humanities Scholar and one of the program’s participants. “Some activities included Middle Eastern cooking, dancing, games, fashion, instruments, calligraphy, and henna.”
Bahati Mutisya, a junior business major and one of this year’s participants, is a dancing enthusiast and especially enjoyed the dance lessons, which included bhangra, belly dancing, and dabke dancing. She also took a lot from the sessions held. 
“During the QALTA class called ‘Breaking Stereotypes,’ we talked about the misconceptions of the Middle East and the Western world,” Mutisya said. “We also learned the differences between their religion and their culture during the ‘Islamic Feminism’ session.”
In terms of their most memorable moments in Qatar, Raed, Mutisya, and Akyar all agreed that this was in their time spent with the Qatar students. 
“One of my favorite moments was the first night,” Raed said. “The eight of us were sitting at a long table with 15 Qatari students, and we were all just firing questions at each other about everything in our cultures.” 
Raed, Akyar, and Mutisya all said that the Qatar students were one of the most hospitable groups of people they had ever met. Raed added that their English was practically “flawless.” 
While in Doha, the students were also able to explore the city outside of the campus. “We had the opportunity to do some fun activities off campus such as sand-duning, or ‘sand-bashing’ as the students in Qatar call it; tour Al-Jazeera; walk around in the souk; visit Fanar, which is the Islamic Cultural Center; tour the ASPIRE sports complex; and visit the Islamic art museum,” Akyar said. 
The last night of the program, the students spent the night with families of the Qatar students. The women in the group experienced a home stay while the men spent a night out in the desert.  
Despite cultural differences, Raed spoke of the similarities he experienced with the students.“They’re just like us,” he said. “In terms of what is on their iPods, what movies they watch, and what music they listen to, it was shocking to me just how similar we are.”
The students were able to interact with 14 Qatar students who visited the Pittsburgh campus the week before spring break to experience American culture and interact with the students in a similar way to the IMPAQT program, and the groups were able to share their experiences. 
Past participants are in constant collaboration, as they all work on forming their own projects that help unite the campuses. Last year’s projects included an orientation event at The Frame to show incoming Pittsburgh students part of the culture of Qatar, a photo installation in Morewood showing images of Carnegie Mellon’s Qatar campus, and a seminar and lunch discussion for Ph.D. students considering research in Qatar.
Students participating in IMPAQT consistently mention the lessons they learned from traveling to Qatar, as well as creating projects with their fellow students.
“I could not have learned what I learned in a classroom or from a book. It was an eye-opening experience,” Mutisya said.
Applications for the 2011 IMPAQT program will be available in the fall.

This Friday is the deadline for city and county governments to express interest and submit proposals for the new Google high-speed network. This innovative experimental fiber-optic network can achieve speeds of up to 100 times current cable, DSL, and fiber-optic networks with a delivery speed of one gigabit per second. 
According to Carnegie Mellon University president Jared Cohon and Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, the cities must show that they have the interest and resources to support Google’s project, and the website www.pittsburghgoesgoogle.com. The competition to attract Google’s attention is wide ranging, spanning 80 cities and 200 Facebook groups, as individuals and companies alike try to gain the network that could almost instantaneously download any book in the Library of Congress, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 
Google, which plans to select winners by the end of the year, announced the Google Fiber for Communities Program on Feb. 10, and will charge competitive rates to a demographic spanning 50,000 to 500,000 people, all while paying for the costs of installation and operation of the network. Citizens, businesses, and universities are encouraged to visit the website and show their support for the city of Pittsburgh.
Kiron K. Skinner, an associate professor in the department of social and decision sciences in H&SS, was appointed to the Advisory Board for the George W. Bush Oral History Project as one of two historians. Skinner is also the director of the International Relations and Politics Program and has served on the National Security Education Board, on the U.S. Defense Department’s Defense Policy Board as an Iraq and Afghanistan war advisor, and on the National Academies Committee on Behavioral and Social-Science Research to Improve Intelligence Analysis for National Security.
The Oral History Project aims to study the life of Bush, the 43rd President, especially through the White House years, as an oral history for the Miller Center of Public Affairs in the University of Virginia. The Miller Center is the only one in the country that documents the lives of former presidents. In addition to Skinner, members of the Advisory Board include Karl Rove and Mark Langdale (president of the George W. Bush Presidential Library Foundation). 
Skinner co-authored The Strategy of Campaigning: Lessons from Ronald Reagan and Boris Yeltsin and authored Turning Points in Ending the Cold War, as well as five other works.

Breed Hall 
(Margaret Morrison 103)
Russell Berman, the Walter A. Haas Professor in the Humanities and Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, talks of the hostile relationships between nations.
The United States’s responses to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 contributed to an outpouring of European anti-Americanism. However, with the bombings in Madrid and London, attitudes about counter-terrorism initiatives changed into a multi-dimensional European reaction against Islamist terror. And while explicit animosity to United States policies has settled, trans-Atlantic relations still rest on shaky ground.

Among the foreign policy dilemmas faced by United States presidents for the last 50 years, that of Israel and Palestine seems among the most intractable.
Republicans and Democrats alike have tried to bring the two sides of the conflict together, sometimes reaching agreements but often watching their best efforts come to naught. Groups in both the Israeli and Arab leadership want peace, but conservative factions of both consistently ruin any chance of a solution. Peace in the Middle East is possible, though it is still many years away. But peace will remain a dream if politics like the ones seen in the past two weeks take precedence over a long-term solution — especially if these challenges are not turned to opportunities.
To follow the events that led up to the current state of American-Israeli relations, some background is necessary. In recent weeks, President Obama has taken the first steps in his attempt at establishing peace in the region. Vice President Biden flew to the Middle East to speak with Israeli and Palestinian leaders and start the first of what would be many rounds of shuttle diplomacy — where a third-party diplomat travels back and forth between two sides in a dispute. While peace was by no means in sight, it seemed like progress could indeed be made.
This initiative seemed relatively standard for the peace process. A U.S. President started diplomatic efforts, leaders on both sides maintained their desire for peace while sticking to their talking points, and most people’s expectations were for more of the same back-and-forth bickering that the last several decades have brought, possibly ending in an agreement of some sort.
But something unexpected happened during Biden’s visit.
On March 8, the Vice President arrived in Israel. A day later, Israel announced the building of 1600 new houses in a West Bank settlement. This announcement violated promises made to American diplomats and threatened to overshadow Biden’s visit. The outrage that resulted from this affront to the United States and the Palestinian Authority — from the timing as much as the content — overwhelmed Israeli expectations. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, failed at his first attempts at damage control when he painted the announcement as a coincidence. Since then, diplomats have been trying to repair the political crisis between allies. Instead of working toward a peace settlement with the Palestinians, Israel has to work on relations with its closest ally and its own government.
The current tension between the United States and Israel was a result primarily of internal Israeli politics. It is these politics — both of Israelis and Palestinians alike — which pose the greatest threat to a promise of long-term peace. Israel’s ruling coalition is currently dominated by conservatives. Some are moderate, like Netanyahu, while others are farther to the right, like Minister of Foreign Affairs Avigdor Lieberman. As a result, the government is forced to take a strong stance against Palestinian claims simply to maintain its legitimacy. Too many concessions would destroy the relatively fragile coalition.
At the same time, President Obama needs to show resolve in foreign policy. Accepting too many of Israel’s conditions would remove any credibility he might have in the Arab world. He is looking to strike a delicate balance between establishing a committed alliance with Israel and allowing for a chance for progress in the peace process. Israel’s settlement announcement during Biden’s visit made this balance untenable. Obama’s peace plan was stalled literally before it began. The majority of the blame for this lies in the arrogance of the Israeli government, which abused its relationship with the United States to distract the peace process and strengthen a conservative coalition. Instead of strengthening this coalition, though, the recent actions have weakened it in the eyes of its own citizens, its allies, and the rest of the world.
Despite the widespread outrage that emerged over the settlement announcement, this diplomatic faux pas could be a blessing in disguise for all parties involved. Israel cannot hope to keep the United States at arm’s length for long, particularly with the threat of Iran nearby. The two sides must come closer, and Netanyahu’s conservative coalition is more likely to change than the Obama administration, which has many other more significant domestic and foreign concerns. A more moderate Israeli administration offers a better chance for peace agreements than the current one ever will. In the end, the conservatives’ tactic of undermining America may backfire.
Neither the United States nor Israel can succeed without the other. Israel needs America to guarantee its continued existence in the midst of hostile neighbors, and America needs Israel for its strategic value as a Middle East democracy. As much as this mutual dependence helps both nations, it also has its drawbacks, which the current controversy only illustrates. 
One of America’s difficulties throughout the process of achieving peace in the region has been a perception that it is biased toward Israel. The United States gives huge amounts of foreign aid to the nation, including weapons and classified technology. Palestinian leaders have been hesitant to trust a mediator that may not have their best interests at heart. If America keeps pressuring Israel on foreign policy, it may improve the image of the United States in terms of its relationship with Palestine.
While it is easy to paint both the Israelis and Palestinians as simply intransigent and impulsive, no major decision on either side comes without costs and risks weighed in advance. Both peoples exist in a careful balance, one that is often violent but more often peaceful. 
For there to be lasting peace, the majority on each side that wants it must take action. If both sides wait for the other to move first, the status quo will exist indefinitely. If the three governments involved truly want a solution, they will take this diplomatic mistake and turn it into a new beginning.

With the campus election season now in full swing, the Elections Board announced that, after petition validation, there were no candidates running in the Tepper School of Business, the Mellon College of Science, or the School of Computer Science. Not a single undergraduate student in any of those three colleges had the desire or motivation to have their petition signed and to be a part of Undergraduate Student Senate.
While we can blame weak marketing this election cycle, this is likely part of a larger, more long-term problem regarding students’ lack of understanding of what Senate is and what Senate does. Without understanding the importance of having representation on a college level, students see no need to become representatives.
We at The Tartan have seen Senate accomplish many of the goals it has set out to meet. It sends its representatives to a number of student advisory councils around the university. It brings in special guests and speakers, who ask the Student Senators for their opinions. (See this week’s story on President Cohon on page A1.) It distributes approximately $90,000 per year in special allocations to other groups and organizations. Yet, this year, three colleges have effectively stated they have absolutely no interest in being represented, and not a single seat in the entire Senate is contested. Every person on the ballot will become a Senator, and a handful more will win with write-in votes in the single digits.
The election process for Senate is supposed to allow the most qualified, most involved, and most enthusiastic members of each of the colleges a voice to represent the needs and wants of the rest of the members of their respective schools. However, the interests of the individual colleges cannot and will not be served if there are no students to speak up for them. And by denying themselves a representative in Senate, the students in these three schools are effectively ensuring that their desires will be put at the very bottom of a long list. Students need to understand that being a part of Senate or having a representative on Senate championing them is vital.
The Senate elections this year are a farce. They are not based on credentials or recruiting motivated students; they are not even a popularity contest. This year, Senate has explicitly become a volunteer organization — anyone who wants to can join and try to keep student government functioning.
Editor’s note: Mellon and Tepper each gained one candidate due to corrected petitions after the initial deadline.

Fighting two problems with one tax proposal, Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl is currently aiming to fill the hole in the city’s budget as well as promote healthy living among Pittsburghers with a new tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. In comparison with the previously proposed tuition tax, this new tax idea — adopted from Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter’s similar legislation — appears to have a more practical rationale behind it. Yet, when it comes to execution, it fails once again. 
At present, the tax will raise the prices of sweetened beverages by two cents per ounce. This will cause consumers to spend roughly $0.17 extra when they buy a can of Red Bull or $1.35 more for a two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola — roughly a 100 percent tax. When this is compared to the pouring tax, currently set at 7 percent, the disparity is easy to see. Looking at it in broader terms, upon purchasing 10 two-liter bottles of Coca-Cola, consumers will be paying an unreasonable $13.50 just in taxes — a substantial increase in prices that seems extreme, especially to consumers without deep pockets. 
While it is laudable that Ravenstahl is attempting to put together a Healthy Pittsburgh Initiative by discouraging residents from consuming sugar-sweetened beverages, the resulting increase in the prices of soda, energy drinks, iced tea, and sports drinks is unfairly high. Furthermore, because the tax is regressive, it is harsher on the poor. Currently the tax is too large to be justified, and while it is fills a necessary gap in the city’s pension fund, the mayor needs to make sure he is not hurting the financial welfare of Pittsburghers in his various attempts to rake in some dough.

It’s in the headlines all the time. We see it, we read it, and we move on. It’s just another piece of news. Why should we spend more time reading about a bombing in some foreign country than reading about the next football game? I guess not everyone does this, but a majority of us do. I have been skimming and ignoring such terrorism-related news for a while now. In fact, I tend to look at the headline and first figure out how many fatalities there were. Four dead? Well, that’s not too bad, right? I mean, we’ve had terrorist attacks in which many more were killed. What difference do four more make to the ever-growing list of innocent people who lost their lives in such attacks?
It was with this attitude that I read the news of nine deaths due to a bomb blast in a small café in India. Nine, I thought, that’s not such a big deal. India’s seen worse. And then I read the name of the city where it happened. Pune. My hometown. I read the name of the café. The German bakery — a place I’ve passed a number of times and heard friends telling me I had to go to because of the great food. I never went inside, and I never will be able to now. I sat staring at the news piece incredulously for a while. This was the first time that something like this had happened in Pune.
Here’s some background info that will help you understand my disbelief. Pune is a sleepy city. Especially when compared to its neighbor, Mumbai, Pune is more of a town than a city. Most shops in Pune close from noon to 4 p.m. People need to eat lunch and then take a nice nap. The streets are either filled with a number of small colleges or are taken up by cafés and restaurants. For a typical “Punekar,” life is all about eating, sleeping, eating, studying a little (if you’re a student), and sleeping and eating some more. It’s a great city and a great life, and you can probably tell why. Now imagine a bomb blast ripping through one of the city’s prized cafés and breaking the serenity of this perfect little picture. Disbelief? My reaction exactly.
After the disbelief had faded, panic started creeping in. My parents usually never go to that part of town — would they have gone there today? Were my friends safe? Once the panic had completely settled in, there was the frantic search for the list of the dead — I wanted to make sure I knew none of them.
It was a small bomb blast. Nine deaths (although the number rose to 17), and I cared. I cared a lot. I went on campus after I read the news article, wondering why everyone wasn’t as upset about the situation as I was. I realize now that I cared because it happened in the city I grew up in and love — why would anyone else care as much? But at that moment, I wished they would. I wished others would understand that bombs in cafés aren’t everyday things.
It’s been a month since the blast happened and it has made me understand that for every such situation, there is somebody out there who does care; that somebody probably also wishes that you would care about it. It’s not possible to be as moved by the situation as someone who has personal links with it, but it is possible to give such happenings a little more thought than we do now. It is possible to at least try to care, to at least read through the entire news article on the subject, to at least realize that this is a serious matter. Bombings aren’t normal, and we should stop treating them as if they were.

I don’t think it is any secret that the Carnegie Mellon Greek community has come under a lot of duress lately. Individual circumstances and bad decisions have naturally led some in the campus community to question whether a Greek system does more good than harm.
From my own familiarity with the quad, Greek life is such a valuable part of the student experience that it is hard to imagine Carnegie Mellon without it. When I was a first-year and considering which house to join, I picked Kappa Delta Rho because of the relationships that I had made with the brothers throughout Orientation week and their fall and spring rush. As I pledged in the spring semester, I learned the value of service and philanthropy, and the importance of facilitating a social scene at Carnegie Mellon — something that is not always easy to find. Though we had a disappointing spring 2007 competing in Booth, Buggy, and Greek Sing, my brothers and I learned a valuable lesson from our own failures. The following year, we worked together and performed much better, with notable second-place performances in Booth and Greek Sing. And finally, last spring we won Booth, won Greek Sing with Kappa Alpha Theta, had our second-best time ever as a house in Buggy, and — most important of all — led fraternities with 16 hours of community service per brother. 
Last spring, I also decided to run for student body vice president. My biggest supporters were my brothers, and without them I would not have had this year’s tremendous experience in service to the campus. Near the end of the spring semester, bad decisions by the fraternity as a whole led to our being removed from campus. Obviously it was difficult to experience the volatile ups and downs of last spring, but what made me feel worst was knowing that future students would be deprived of the experiences that I had at KDR.
Good risk management is key for students partaking in the Greek system. However, it has gotten to the point where nearly all Greek students engage in practices of hiding risk rather than managing risk, and that is a fault of the individual houses, Interfraternity Council, and the Greek community as a whole. Under the current risk management structure of our Greek Quad, risk management authorities are pressured to hide risk rather than manage it because of unrealistic standards of acceptable risk. The circumstances resemble enforcing Prohibition in the 1920s, and the lengths to which speakeasies would go to not get caught. Despite these faults of the Greek system, it is built on strong merits, and members of the community should look to these merits when making decisions that affect their safety and the safety of those around them.

Once in a while, I like to read a textbook whose flash-and-trash content is akin to that of the National Examiner or Star magazine. However, since the textbook market tends to produce high-quality content (most of the time), horrendously written textbooks are hard to come by for use in this cathartic experience. This may all change soon, due to the fact that the Texas Board of Education recently passed a social studies curriculum that will put a conservative twist on history and economics. Or, less subtly put, bombast you with a Republican lovefest.
The vote, 10 to five along party lines, will structure history in elementary through high school textbooks in a way that glorifies the Republican Party, stresses American capitalism, and asserts that the country was founded solely on Christian beliefs. The conservative members of the panel justified this as a response to what they see as a “liberal bias” in academia. Suddenly, my esteem dropped tenfold for these presumably grouchy old men sittin’ on the board o’ education of the great state of Texas in their Wrangler jeans and their unnecessarily flatulent trucks, placing his intelligence somewhere between Hugh Hefner’s girlfriends (collectively) and that one chick on The Bachelor that everyone hated.
The wizened minds that write textbooks to educate our children also demonstrated that they can employ subtle tactics in their adoration of conservative “values.” Instead of asking hardworking schoolchildren to “describe the role of Ronald Reagan,” the textbook will soon prompt them to “describe Ronald Reagan’s leadership” (emphasis added). A later chapter, I’m sure, will read something like “describe George W. Bush’s leadership in the war on terrorism. Discuss the vastly successful results in grisly detail.”
Students will also be prompted to wax elegant about “the causes ... of the conservative resurgence ... including the Moral Majority and the National Rifle Association.” This just proves that if there’s anything conservatives like more than thumping their Bibles and toting their guns (or perhaps thumping their Bibles while toting their guns), it’s pandering to stereotypes. This is, after all, a state whose small-town tourist brochures promote the historical significance of the local Bible and Rifle Church. I know because I’ve seen them.
Looking at the situation from an elevated perspective, this might be reminiscent of a Darwin Award, adequately applied to events that deserve merit for the way they make society regress. As individual Darwin Awards recognize individuals who have removed themselves from the gene pool with their idiotic actions, the board of education is on its way to removing Texas from modern civilization. But ironically, that might not even matter. Because in 10 or so years, no one in the Lone Star State is going to believe in Darwin anyway. Oh, the irony.

It’s late March, and the freeze over our Steel City is finally starting to thaw. Clouds are parting, the sun is shining, and flowers are emerging. But what is more beautiful than this welcomed springtime weather? The redesigned Student Information Online portal, of course.
SIO received a significant overhaul over break. Whereas the online interface was previously outfitted with an outdated style featuring confusing and poorly organized information sections, the new SIO is more suited to students’ real needs. Users can view their grades, schedule, finances, and other information — and can even see grades charted on a user-friendly (though not always comforting) line graph. Students can also download an unofficial PDF of their transcripts directly from the site.
On a campus where more students than not seem to be triple-majoring and co-chairing multiple student organizations, and maintaining an above-average grade point average, it’s about time that the software they use supports — not challenges — all of the aspects of their academic lives at Carnegie Mellon.
However, the new SIO system’s release and execution should have been promoted more effectively, rather than discovered largely via word of mouth through student social networks. There was little on-campus advertising and no official university e-mail announcing the system’s update, or even who was responsible for its change.
We look forward to the coming improvements in some of the other systems that students must access, such as On-Line Registration, and even the HUB’s main webpage. Moreover, we hope that such system upgrades will be promoted more effectively and communicated to the student body in a more direct and transparent manner.

In the fading noise from the closing ceremonies of the Olympic games, the Paralympians compete. But after two weeks of focused international attention, the media seems to move away from sports competition back to the commonplace: the economy, new technology, celebrity gossip, and ongoing war. Often the Paralympics are lost in this return to normalcy.
For us, it took a gallery of incredible images from this year’s X Paralympic Winter Games to even give thought to the 506 athletes who competed in Vancouver and Whistler this past week. A photograph of Haitao Du, a cross-country skier from China, pictures him competing in the 20-kilometer cross-country race, with no poles and no arms. A photograph from the podium of the men’s slalom standing event shows Australian bronze-medalist Cameron Rahles-Rahbula with one leg; German silver-medalist Gerd Schonfelder with only one arm; and New Zealand gold-medalist Adam Hall, who suffers from spina bifida. A shot of the United States’ Patrick McDonald getting ready for his team’s wheelchair curling game just begs the question — how do they even do that?
It is a testament to the ability and perseverance of these athletes that the Paralympics can even exist. These men and women have overcome disabilities that society views as completely debilitating and are taking part in an event that defines them as some of the top competitors in the world.
Originally a portmanteau combining “paraplegic” with “Olympic,” the global governing body of the games has re-oriented the title to replace paraplegic with parallel. They are supporting the ideal of the Paralympics being a co-event with the Olympic movement, not a sideline occurrence. And this is apparent to those who pay attention to the games. These are incredible performances of athleticism that unfortunately seem to have fallen out of the spotlight.
We want these Olympians to be granted the same respect as their peers whom we watched, eyes glued to televisions and monitors for days. They are every bit as qualified and have often come from unimaginable places to reach their dreams. They deserve our attention as much as the Olympics that fills mass media.
So, for the same reasons as for the Olympic games, give the Paralympics a look next time they’re on — to see compelling athletes representing their countries, their competitive spirits outshining any obstacles that may have been placed in their way.
