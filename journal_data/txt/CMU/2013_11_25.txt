Senior Josh Newby and sophomore Rekha Schnepf took on the 2013 NCAA Division III Cross Country Championships this past Saturday at Hanover College.
This was Newby’s second appearance at the national level of competition, his first being with the team last fall. Schnepf grazed the NCAA course for the first time and is the first woman to compete in the NCAA Championship for the Tartans since the 2011 season.
Josh Newby ran a great race, placing 53rd in the nation and fifth in the conference with a time of 25:35.
Newby started the first two miles of the race pretty conservatively, and then spent the next three miles quickening his pace and making up a lot of ground. 
There were 275 men competing in the race, leaving runners “jostling and elbows and spikes flying around on the turns,” Newby said.
The Palo Alto native has been running since his freshman year of high school, which is when his training for Saturday’s NCAA Championships began.
“Your fitness multiplies and grows over time, so you can’t just reach maximal fitness in just one season.… It is literally an eight year process,” he said.
The senior can’t imagine his life without running: “The discipline it has taught me and the fact that I’ve worked towards the goal of becoming a better runner pretty much for two hours every day for eight years; I have to imagine that has made me more disciplined in other parts of my life.”
For Newby, running is a battle against the mind. “It’s a release. Your body reverts to muscle memory and you zone out; you’re not worried about what’s going on in your classes or your social life,” he said.
Looking back at his collegiate career, Newby’s favorite memory was making the NCAA Championship as a team last year. “It was most beneficial bonding experience the team has had because we worked together toward the goal for the entire season and it paid off,” he said.
As a first-year, Newby looked up to the seniors in awe. 
Being a senior now, it’s hard for him to believe that he is now the role model for the underclassmen.
“If I knew as a freshman that I would end up going to NCAA’s individually my senior year, I would have been pretty amazed,” he said.
In the future, Newby plans on training for marathons; the longest race he has run up to date is a half marathon. “It’s a completely different beast,” Newby claims, “it’s a mental battle way more than a physical one.”
As Newby ends his career on a high note, Schnepf is making leaps and bounds as a sophomore.
On Saturday, Schnepf finished the 6k course with a time of 23:17, placing 189th out of 280 competitors.
Although her time was not a season best, the race was a great learning experience for her.
Schnepf started running several years before high school because her father was a runner in college. 
While training for races, Schnepf puts her best foot forward though is constantly worried about getting injured. “Because then you can’t run and you can’t get any better,” she said. Luckily, the sophomore had an injury-free spring and summer, setting a solid foundation for her great season.
The thought of qualifying individually hadn’t even crossed Schnepf’s mind. “I thought as a team we had a really good chance of making it together, but there are so many moving parts that you can never really predict that,” she said.
“I wasn’t even sure that I had made it to regionals, let alone nationals,” Schnepf said. “I don’t want to get my hopes up and end up being disappointed.”
After her success this season, Schnepf is destined to be a team captain, but she is going to wait her turn. “I think we have some really great upperclassmen that deserve to be captain next year,” Schnepf said. 
She is excited about the fresh talent on the team: “They should know they have a lot of potential.”
As Newby ends his career on a high note, Schnepf represents the future of the women’s cross country team.

At the start of the season, every team is optimistic about its chances. There’s a clean slate: no wins and no losses.
On Monday’s home opener, the men’s basketball team gave substance to this optimism with a dominant second half, vanquishing Geneva College in an 81–67 victory.
The first half, however, gave cause for concern. While the perimeter defense was usually solid, there were plenty of breakdowns that led to open three-point attempts. The bigger problem was a lack of rim protection, as Geneva was extremely efficient under the basket.
This allowed Geneva players to hang around longer than they should have against a Carnegie Mellon squad that often seemed to have an unstoppable offense.
Leading by only one point going into the second half with a score of 33–32, the Tartans really got going after the intermission, hitting shot after shot.
An early second-half run, spearheaded by shooting from first-year guard Matt Hillman and solid play from senior forward Rob Mohen, separated Carnegie Mellon from Geneva for good.
Mohen turned in an excellent two-way performance, leading the team in scoring with 17 points, to go with solid defending and rebounding.
However, the real key to the victory was a huge hot streak from senior guard/forward Christian Manoli, who finished with 17 points and eight rebounds.
Manoli was quick to credit his teammates. “It wasn’t even me,” he said, “It was the team. Hillman came out to play; Rob Mohen came to play; everyone came out to play.”
He acknowledged his slow start, saying, “I missed my first two threes of the game, but a shooter’s got to shoot. You just have to come out and you can’t get deterred.”
Beyond the three-pointers that got the ball rolling for Carnegie Mellon in the second half, Manoli was effective getting to the hoop, carving up the Geneva defense.
On defense, the struggles that plagued Carnegie Mellon in the first half were gone after the break. While Geneva scored more points in the second half, this was a result of Carnegie Mellon pushing the pace.
In the second half, Carnegie Mellon forced Geneva into nine turnovers and closed out the perimeter, leaving Geneva with only one three-point attempt. While the offense ran the show, the defense allowed this game to be blown more open than a 14-point margin would indicate.
In what can only be described as an auspicious start to the season, Carnegie Mellon put on a performance they could build off of, as they hosted the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg on Saturday afternoon in an 85–72 victory.

One-for-one trades are rare in professional sports.
With multiple draft picks and role players available, teams almost always toss in a few fillers to balance swapped players’ salaries and skill levels. This is even truer in baseball when teams have access to their deep minor league system.
That’s why the Texas Rangers’s trade of All-Star second baseman Ian Kinsler and $30 million to the Detroit Tigers for first baseman Prince Fielder was that much more shocking.
For both teams, this deal gave up some of their strengths in return for help in an area of desperate need. The Tigers had three power hitting first basemen/designated hitters in Fielder, 2013 American League MVP Miguel Cabrera, and former catcher Victor Martinez.
When Detroit signed Fielder back in 2012, Martinez had just been knocked out of the year with a torn ACL injury, and the Tigers still thought they were in a position to compete for a World Series. Fielder was still available on the free agent market and the Tigers brought him in to help them compete, but at the steep cost of a $214 million contract over nine years.
Now Martinez is healthy and productive again, while the Tigers are off to a disappointing loss to the eventual champion Boston Red Sox in the American League Championship Series. Cabrera’s deficiencies at third base have become unbearable as he ages, and neither he nor Fielder desired to become the full-time designated hitter.
Detroit is also about to hit a payroll bind when CY Young winner Max Scherzer becomes a free agent at the end of the 2014 season and Cabrera’s contract expires after 2015.
Detroit’s trade for Kinsler filled two needs. First, payroll relief: Kinsler will make $57 million over the next four seasons, while Fielder will make $168 million over the next seven years.
Second, Kinsler and Detroit’s shortstop Jose Iglesias, who was acquired in a midseason trade with the Red Sox, will help turn what was a defensive liability in the infield into a strength. Cabrera will move over to his more natural position at first base and top prospect Nick Castellanos will likely be the starting third basemen. Castellanos brings a lot more range to the hot corner than Cabrera, along with some added speed.
For the Rangers, Fielder fills a massive hole in the middle of their lineup. After losing All-Stars Josh Hamilton and Mike Napoli to free agency the past two seasons, Texas was missing some pop in the middle of its line-up.
This became apparent once slugger Nelson Cruz started his 50-game suspension in connection with the biogenesis performance-enhancing drug scandal. Cruz is now a free agent and already turned down the Rangers’ qualifying offer, and there a few power-hitting free agents available who can fill the void. With Fielder, however, the Rangers have a strong left-handed hitter in the middle of the lineup to complement third baseman Adrian Beltre.
Kinsler’s absence also opens up the logjam in the middle of the infield. With shortstop Elvis Andrus signing an eight year, $120 million contract extension at the start of the season, top prospect Jurickson Profar was stuck with no place to play.
Profar played a fill-in role this past year, split time at third base, shortstop, second base, left field and designated hitter. His offensive game struggled as a result. He had a meager 0.234 batting average in 85 games.
The Rangers have no problem taking on the extra payroll with the Rangers’ local television contract about to balloon in 2015. The Rangers are one of the few contending teams that are looking to expand payroll instead of contract it and are likely to add at least one or two more big names before the offseason is over, be it through trade or free agency.
This was a perfect fit for the two teams. Each team had an excess of talent at premium positions and a deficiency in other areas. It’s bold for general managers to make these moves with large room for speculation about their effect five years down the line. But the Tigers and Rangers want to win and have now shown the league that they will do anything necessary to do so.

Though common sense can sometimes seem rare in the human population, it is almost never associated with computers. Carnegie Mellon researchers, however, are currently implementing a program that allows a computer to label images and acquire common sense almost entirely on its own. The program, called the Never Ending Image Learner (NEIL) runs constantly on Carnegie Mellon’s campus and analyzes thousands of images daily. The researchers aim to create the world’s largest visual database and ultimately improve computer vision.
The research team is led by Abhinav Gupta, an assistant research professor in the department of robotics, and includes Xinlei Chen, a Ph.D. student in Carnegie Mellon’s Language Technologies Institute, and Abhinav Shrivastava, a Ph.D. student in robotics.
Their work builds upon already existing programs that gather a visual knowledge base, such as ImageNet and Visipedia. The issue with these programs, the researchers explain, is that they simply rely too much on human instruction to cover the vast amount of visual data available on the Internet. The fact that NEIL can operate largely on its own makes the process of building visual knowledge bases much more feasible.
Having a computer learn visually is far superior to having it learn from text alone. For example, purely analyzing text references might create incorrect assumptions about objects that would be obvious to people who can see. In this way, NEIL learns in a similar fashion to humans. Babies make visual connections long before they have the ability to read; NEIL works off of the same basic principle.
Since the project began in July, NEIL has analyzed over 5 million pictures. NEIL is able to make the common sense connections by looking through all of these images. For example, after looking through thousands of pictures of wheels and cars, NEIL can make the connection in its own language that “Car” can have a part called a “Wheel.” The program has managed to make over 3,000 of these connections and categorized approximately 500,000 objects.
The technical approach behind NEIL is complex. The researchers started with thousands of “seed images” that they gathered from Google Images in order to train NEIL to recognize patterns. They then used a clustering approach to set up specific models that NEIL can use for future searching. They built upon these models to develop relationships between objects. The program works so that each time NEIL identifies a new object or relationship, it adds to its body of knowledge and becomes better at making visual connections.
“What we have learned in the last 5-10 years of computer vision research is that the more data you have, the better computer vision becomes,” Gupta said in a university press release.
The public can follow NEIL in real-time through the website www.neil-kb.com. The website categorizes NEIL’s knowledge base into objects such as “1950s_car”, scenes such as “Alaska”, and attributes, such as “brown.” As NEIL’s analysis becomes increasingly exhaustive, it will further develop the capability to sub-categorize objects and identify deeper relationships than those between objects. Furthermore, visitors to the site are allowed to send a request or submit a phrase for NEIL to look up.
The program isn’t perfect, of course. NEIL can make mistakes during some searches, especially with homonyms. For example, the researchers mentioned that “Pink” could pose a problem as NEIL might be confused whether the term refers to the pop star or the color. Additionally, because NEIL runs all day, it is computationally intensive and requires over 200 processing cores in 2 clusters.
Moving forward, the team is excited for NEIL’s potential contributions to the fields of scene classification and object classification. They will travel to Sydney, Australia in December to present their current findings at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) International Conference on Computer Vision.

Whether it is a crispy piece of bacon or an apple pie, every piece of cooked food you eat has been transformed by a varied and complex series of chemical reactions.
When a piece of meat hits a hot pan or bread rises in the oven, a chemical reaction involving an amino acid and a sugar gives it the browned appearance that lets us know that it’s cooked. This reaction, called the Maillard reaction, doesn't just make food look cooked — it’s also responsible for the flavor and aroma of cooked food.
The Maillard reaction is named after the French chemist Louis Camille Maillard, who first discussed the essence of the reaction in his 1912 paper. The reaction wasn’t described in detail, however, until a 1953 paper was published by John Hodge, a chemist working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Even today, the complex reaction isn’t fully understood because of the many variables and possible outcomes.
The marriage of high heat, amino acids, and sugar is responsible for the Maillard reaction. Although it doesn't seem as if foods such as bread or meat would have sugar in them, even the most savory foods have these naturally occurring carbohydrates.
Since the Maillard reaction is so all-encompassing, the mechanisms behind it are multiplex. In the first stage of the reaction, a reducing sugar, such a glucose, condenses with a compound that contains a free amino group, and a chain of amino acids that make up a protein. From there, the sugar-amino acid reaction forms the Amadori rearrangement product, the beginning of a series of more complicated organic reactions.
The Amadori product reacts in different ways to produce different scents and flavors, mostly dependent on how acidic the system is. The Maillard reaction is notoriously complex and difficult to control; it does, after all, result in most of the flavors and scents people see and smell in cooked foods.
While the Maillard reaction affects a wide variety of foods, it is not the only browning process. Caramelization is the browning of sugar, seen commonly in roasted marshmallows, crème brûlée, and, of course, caramel.
Caramelization is a considerably simpler reaction than the Maillard reaction, since it involves just heat and sugar. Although caramelization occurs at different temperatures depending on the type of sugar, it generally happens at around 338˚F.
Caramelization is an example of pyrolysis, a decomposition of organic compounds at high heats. Caramelization, like the Maillard reaction, is a non-enzymatic browning process.
In the first step of caramelization, water evaporates from the sugar. Next, the sugar starts to break down into smaller compounds. Sucrose, for example — also known as table sugar — breaks down into glucose and fructose. From here, like in the Maillard reaction, there's a condensation process. During this step, the individual sugar compounds react with one another to form hundreds of complicated aromatic compounds. These compounds are what give caramelized foods their signature sweet and nutty taste.
Caramelization can produce a wide range of flavorful compounds. Diacetyl, for example, gives food a butterscotch-like taste. Other compounds produced by caramelization include furans, which have a nutty flavor; esters, which have a rum-like flavor; and maltol, which has a toasty flavor.
As anyone who has accidentally burned sugar knows, caramelization can easily go too far. If sugar is left to caramelize too long, the process will break down the original sugar to the point where it becomes blackened and bitter. This is a result of the oxidization of the sugar. 
Sugar, a carbohydrate, is made up of rings of carbon atoms, along with hydrogen and oxygen. After sugar is oxidized so much that we consider it burnt, what’s left over is mostly carbon. Blackened, burned sugar is akin to briquettes on the grill or to chimney soot, both of which are made up of mostly burnt carbon compounds.
Although food is simple to eat, the chemical processes behind producing the flavors and aromas we know and love are actually very complex and — to this day — not completely understood. As researchers learn more about the Maillard reaction and caramelization, it can lead to new ways to manipulate how processed foods look and taste.

Nov. 18 marked a historic day for space exploration. At 1:28 p.m., NASA launched a 5,400-pound spacecraft on the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, according to NASA’s MAVEN launch updates website.
Mars, named after the Roman god of war for its distinct red color, resides in an orbit approximately one and a half astronomical units from the sun. Home of Olympus Mons, the largest known volcano in the solar system, as well as the famous Valles Marineris canyons, Mars has long been a favorite among astronomers, as well as the planet on which the possibility of human habitation seems most probable.
Unfortunately, most studies of the intriguing planet have been done from observatories on Earth, which, at its closest approach to Mars, is still millions of miles away. According to nineplanets.org, the first spacecraft to visit Mars was Mariner 4 in 1965. Since then, several other missions to the elusive planet have been made. However, NASA’s website states that the MAVEN spacecraft will surpass previous explorations to Mars: “[It] will provide information about the Red Planet’s atmosphere, climate history and potential habitability in greater detail than ever before.”
According to a NASA press release from the day of the launch, the MAVEN spacecraft separated from an Atlas V Centaur rocket’s second stage 53 minutes after the launch. Approximately seven minutes later, solar arrays powering the spacecraft were deployed, and the MAVEN was off on its 10-month journey to Mars. It should arrive at Mars next September.
The main goal of the MAVEN mission is to understand the upper atmosphere of Mars — in particular, how the loss of atmospheric gas to space changed and affected the climate of the planet. To calculate how much of the Martian atmosphere has escaped into space, MAVEN will measure the current rate of escape and gather information to learn about the process so that a backwards extrapolation can be done.
The mission team is comprised of a diverse group of scientists. MAVEN Project Manager David Mitchell is from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., which manages the project and provided two science instruments for the mission. MAVEN Principal Investigator Bruce Jakosky works from the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder. The Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley also provided science instruments for the mission. NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. is instrumental in navigation support. Lockheed Martin built the spacecraft and is in charge of mission operations.
“After 10 years of developing the mission concept and then the hardware, it’s incredibly exciting to see MAVEN on its way,” Jakosky said in a NASA press release. “But the real excitement will come in 10 months, when we go into orbit around Mars and can start getting the science results we planned.”

Last Tuesday, Carnegie Mellon University announced its creation of the Institute for Strategic Analysis (CMU-ISA). This new organization will offer a centralized office to coordinate consultations with senior U.S. defense, intelligence, and diplomatic officials pursuing science and engineering solutions.
Carnegie Mellon has long been considered a resource to National Security officials for its expertise in computer science, cybersecurity, decision science, and international relations. In addition to its reputation for conducting cutting-edge research in areas such as robotics, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction, Carnegie Mellon’s history of coordinating interdisciplinary efforts translates to the university’s ability to pragmatically approach complicated real-world problems.
Under the leadership of Kiron Skinner, the director of Carnegie Mellon’s Center for International Relations and Politics and an associate professor of social and decision sciences, the CMU-ISA will draw from the School of Computer Science, Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, and CIT to organize lecture series, fellowships, and short courses for defense and intelligence officials seeking expert advice. Before the creation of the institute, officials in need of consultation had to depend on their own research and connections to determine who in the university to contact. Now, the institute formalizes the process and optimizes it by serving as a liaison — officials can contact the CMU-ISA and members there will pull the resources together.
Work in the School of Computer Science and CIT have long been tapped for government usage.
“Carnegie Mellon isn’t entering into policy debates, but providing information on the basic science that underlies policy and determines what is possible and what is not,” Skinner emphasized in a university press release.
Another important distinction of the CMU-ISA from the university is that it will neither become a research institution nor will it administer degrees. Like Carnegie Mellon’s Office of Government Relations, which works with more Congressional leaders than National Security ones, the CMU-ISA is intended to strictly facilitate connections between Carnegie Mellon and the government.
The institute will not facilitate research and will instead focus on providing information to federal agencies and seeking projects from them. In addition to describing itself as a resource to Congress members and their staff, the Office of Government Relations lists among its goals “to identify new opportunities for the university to engage in federally-funded research.”
Federally funded projects are common at Carnegie Mellon. According to Carnegie Mellon’s 2012-13 Consolidated Financial Statements, sponsored projects are the single largest source of operating revenue, totaling $406.1 million in 2013. The federal government accounts for 86.7 percent of that funding, about 40 percent of which comes from the Department of Defense.

Diabetes drug could fight cancer
Researchers have discovered that metformin, a drug currently used to treat diabetes, could be used to treat cancer. Clinical trials are already underway to determine how effectively the drug treats various cancers. There are many benefits to the use of metformin as a cancer treatment. Metformin has a strong safety record and only mild side effects — as indicated by its use as a diabetes drug — and it’s inexpensive when compared with many other cancer-fighting drugs. Metformin could potentially treat a wide variety of cancers and even Parkinson’s.

Volcano found under Antarctica
A group of scientists including Doug Wiens, a professor of earth and planetary science at Washington University in St. Louis, has discovered a volcano located a kilometer beneath the ice in West Antarctica. The scientists used a seismograph array to create images of the ice and rock in West Antarctica, and two unusual seismic events prompted a closer investigation of the area. They concluded that the volcano will definitely erupt. It will most likely not break through the ice above it, but could cause large-scale melting of ice in West Antarctica.

Neanderthal virus found in human
Scientists from the U.K.  have discovered evidence of ancient Neanderthal viruses in modern human DNA. They compared genetic data from fossils to that of current-day cancer patients; the results suggested that some modern viruses could have originated from diseases present in our ancestors over 500,000 years ago. The team is now researching whether these viruses, part of the HML2 family of viruses, are active in modern humans. Researchers hope that this new discovery will help scientists determine links between ancient viruses and modern diseases such as HIV and cancer.

Young galaxies can offer space insight
Using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array telescope and NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have discovered three primitive galaxies 13 billion light-years from Earth. These galaxies, which are approximately 800 million years old, look as though they are ready to merge into one large galaxy. Astronomers believe this large galaxy, which they are calling Himiko, could eventually evolve into a galaxy like the Milky Way. Astronomers believe that Himiko could provide valuable insight on the formation of the earliest galaxies in the universe.

Eating nuts shown to extend life
Studies at the University of Toronto have related the consumption of nuts with longer survival. The research was based on two long-term studies that investigated the health and lifestyle of approximately 119,000 health professionals for 24 to 30 years. Scientists found that people consuming at least 28 grams of nuts, two to four times a week, were 13 percent less likely to die during the study. People who ate nuts five to six times a week were 15 percent less likely to die, and those eating nuts seven or more times a week were 20 percent less likely to die. The scientists believe that it is too early to say that nuts alone will increase longevity, but they do support the idea that nuts are a strong part of a healthy diet.

Electronics may become wearable
Researchers have discovered that polyester yarn can be used to create flexible, solar-powered batteries that could make wearable electronics even more convenient. Current wearable electronics, such as smartwatches and Google Glass, still involve a charger with a cord. Alternatives to this, such as textile batteries, are expensive and impractical for use in wearable electronics. Scientists have discovered, however, that polyester yarn coated with nickel and carbon produces a flexible battery that can be folded and stretched. This material can also be combined with light-weight solar cells, which removes the need to plug in wearable electronics.

Warning: This article contains spoilers for Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues.
Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues has been subject to high expectations since a jazz-flute-playing Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) announced the film's release on late-night talk show Conan in March 2012. The movie has finally arrived, and if you're a fan of the original, the sequel may go down as one of 2013's biggest disappointments. The laughs — while uproarious when they occur — are few and far between, and the movie drags on like a lonely drive across the Pennsylvania Turnpike on a cloudy day. Since the sequel was released nearly 10 years after the surprise hit Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, it must be asked why this movie even had to be made.
Set in the early 1980s, Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues finds the Channel 4 news team grappling with the profound changes to their profession brought on by the introduction of cable and the 24-hour news cycle. Burgundy and the rest of the crew are enlisted for the 2 a.m. graveyard slot at cable news network GNN (Global News Network). In an attempt to boost ratings for the station's launch, they create the kind of mindless patriotic fanfare and celebrity-worship dribble that passes for news today. 
Along the way, shenanigans ensue that are similar to those in the first movie. Dim-witted, intolerant Ron Burgundy attempts to adjust to his modern surroundings; he forms a romantic relationship with his African-American boss, Linda Jackson, and tries to create some kind of connection with his young son, Walter. 
One of the best things about Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues is that the entire original cast returns to reprise their roles. In addition to Ferrell's Burgundy, Steve Carell is back as clueless weatherman Brick Tamland; Paul Rudd returns as stylish investigative reporter Brian Fantana; and David Koechner once again tries to repress his homosexual urges for Burgundy as boisterous sports reporter Champ Kind. Christina Applegate is also back as Veronica Corningston while Chris Parnell, Fred Willard, and Vince Vaughn all appear in their old roles during brief cameos.
Clocking in at two hours, Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues sticks around like an uninvited party guest who pours another drink after everyone else has left. Director Adam McKay allows Ferrell to go off on multiple random tangents that do nothing for the story and elicit hardly any chuckles. If these useless bits had been cut and the humor moved the story along, Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues may have held a toe to the original.
There are a few genuinely hilarious segments in the sequel, but also long stretches of film that are nothing but cringe-worthy.  The biggest misstep Ferrell and McKay make is incorporating racial humor into the Burgundy canon: the gags are rarely funny and, in a few cases, are flat-out uncomfortable. 
Ferrell gives it his all to do what his character is there to do — carry the entire movie — and he sometimes manages to pull his role off. Burgundy's hapless attempts to communicate with his son provide viewers with more than a few of the movie's laugh-out-loud moments. 
The supporting cast tries to push the movie along as well, but only Rudd and Carrell are given material that they're able to spin into gold. The rest of the cast at best play the straight man to someone else's laugh.
Kristin Wiig appears as Tamland's equally brain-dead female counterpart, and successfully toes the line between cute and creepy in her limited screen time. Seeing the two actors play off each other in their scenes together is a delight, and expanding the duo's storyline would have benefited the film. The scene involving the two characters going on a date to a soda machine is utterly priceless.
Wiig isn't the only new face this time around. Compared to Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, which contained very few established actors at the time, Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues is loaded with big-name supporting characters and cameos. Who ever thought one would ever be able to see Drake, Liam Neeson, and Jim Carrey all in the same movie? 
Little hype surrounded Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy in 2004: the film's producer Judd Apatow had little to his name but a series of failed television shows including Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared; its leading man Will Ferrell's biggest success had been a supporting role in Old School; and the rest of the film's cast was virtually unheard of. 
Today, Apatow is known as a man who revived R-rated comedy — he's responsible for such movies as The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Bridesmaids. Will Ferrell is now an American comedy institution for better or worse. Much of the supporting cast of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy — especially Steve Carrell — have all become comic megastars. 
One might think that this kind of comedy dream team returning to the premise that helped launch their careers into the stratosphere could only result in success. That's probably what the cast and crew were thinking, as well as the studio that finally decided to bankroll the project after long periods of budget negotiations. The only thing Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues results in, however, is proving true the age-old maxim that lightning never strikes twice in the same place. Maybe one day Hollywood will stop trying to prove that saying wrong.

Warning: This article contains spoilers for The Wolf of Wall Street.
Director Martin Scorsese's latest film, The Wolf of Wall Street, based on a true story, depicts the rocket-ship rise and spectacular fall of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his time on Wall Street. Belfort is a nice Jewish boy from Queens who, like all young men in the 1980s, is eager to make his fortune trading stocks. What begins as honest ambition quickly spirals into insatiable lust for drugs, women, and the sexiest thing there is: money. 
Belfort establishes the brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont to peddle worthless, high-commission penny stocks. He and his team simply cold call unwitting investors and convince them that they're getting in on the ground floor of a lucrative new company. Belfort is no Gordon Gekko, the smart, ruthless investing wizard created by Oliver Stone for his 1987 film Wall Street: He is just a common swindler.
Surrounding himself with like-minded hedonists and schemers, including his best friend Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), Belfort uses the firm to fuel his every desire. These schemers spend thousands of company dollars on fancy dinners, prostitutes, cocaine, their beloved Quaaludes, and just about everything else you could imagine. Nothing gold can stay, however, and eventually F.B.I. agent Partick Denham (Kyle Chandler) plucks Belfort from his yacht and dumps him in federal prison.
Scorsese delivers on his promise of pure, unadulterated excess that he made when he released the film's trailer in June. The problem is that it's all the film contains. The movie is as deep as Jay-Z's "Big Pimpin' " music video and merely skims the surface of what could be an interesting class-conscious tale of ethnically diverse outsiders trying to break into what the movie characterizes as a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant stronghold.
That's not to say that the movie is without merit. The film moves faster than a heart rate after a line of cocaine off a hooker's chest — a scene that occurs more than a few times — and Scorsese rarely lets a moment overstay its welcome. DiCaprio hasn't lit up the screen in a lead role like this since The Departed, and it's his performance that gives the movie most of its draw. Jonah Hill has finally found a role that perfectly blends his natural knack for humor with the kind of dramatic depth he's been trying to exhibit since Moneyball in 2011. Boardwalk Empire creator Terence Winter's script will have you laughing out loud — such as the scene when Belfort and Azoff fight in a kitchen while high on the strongest Quaaludes available  — but blatantly chooses to ignore anything that isn't pure fun.
Disappointingly, The Wolf of Wall Street is nothing more than a glimpse at what life would be if one chose to ignore all questions of morality, mortality, and any other inhibition from indulging in every dark desire. Scorsese famously updated the tried-and-true gangster movie when he shot it full of style with his 1990 classic Goodfellas, and he had a similar opportunity here. But instead of an update to the tried-and-true Wall Street morality tale, we're left with another predictable and familiar story of corruption and greed. What a pity.

The seventh annual Bhangra in the Burgh (BIB) competition was held at Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall last Saturday night. Although only seven years old, BIB has consistently brought together some of the best Bhangra teams in the North America and has sold out multiple shows.
“It was obviously a really fun show,” said Pranita Ramakrishnan, sophomore information systems major and BIB co-chair. Aside from the flashy dancing, however, the co-chairs were all most excited about getting the community involved in and excited about Bhangra, a dance style for which they all share passion.
This year’s competition differed from previous ones in that it was promoted accessibly all over campus. “Before the show we tried to make the PR really fun,” Ramakrishnan said. Anyone who walked past Doherty Hall the weeks preceding the show can attest to the energetic music that blasted while committee members sold tickets for both the event and the after-party.
This year, the committee also welcomed Indian emcee Jus Reign, a famous Punjabi comedian and YouTube sensation. As host for the show, Jus Reign kept the fun alive between sets as he held “impromptu” Skype video calls with his brother and joked about the lack of white people in the audience.
On Saturday, Pittsburgh welcomed eight competitive teams: the University of California, Berkeley’s Bhangra team (Cal Bhangra), Columbia University’s Bhangra team (Columbia Bhangra), Cornell University’s Bhangra team (Cornell Bhangra), First Class Bhangra (FCB), George Mason University’s Bhangra team (GMU Bhangra), Shaan Mutiyaaran Di Bhangra Club, the University of Virgina’s Di Shaan, and Virginia Commonwealth University’s Bhangra team (VCU Bhangra). Also featured were five local exhibition acts: Carnegie Mellon University’s Chak de Bhangra, the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Masti, the University of Pittsburgh’s PantheRaas, Carnegie Mellon’s Deewane, and Carnegie Mellon’s Soulstylz.
Maintaining its roots in Punjabi folk dancing, modern Bhangra has been transformed into a lively dance style that hints at hip-hop and other modern influences. The teams performing last Saturday all put on technically stunning performances, the main discrepancies between the acts being the level of modern influence.
Columbia Bhangra started the night off strong. The group put on one of the more modernized performances and was able to energize the crowd, setting a good vibe for the rest of the night.
Crowd favorite FCB, an all-male Pittsburgh-area Bhangra group, brought a similarly modernized performance, easily the most dynamic and energetic performance of the night. The energy was evident before the dance even started; the dancers pumped up the audience by jumping excitedly up and down as they took the stage in dim lighting. The crowd cheered continuously throughout the performance.
The last competitive team to take the stage, UVA Di Shaan, ended the competition with another high-energy dance with obvious modern influence. Their performance started off with the most exciting light show of the night with rainbow colors flashing along with the beat. The fun didn’t end there, however: The performance was once again on the less traditional side, infusing techno music and hard-hitting hip-hop moves, and the choreography was both technically challenging and engaging for the audience.
Emphasizing one of the modern styles that has had a great impact on Bhangra, Carnegie Mellon’s elite hip-hop team Soulstylz also made an appearance. Although not so flashy and colorful as the Bhangra dances, Soulstylz provided a refreshing and creative set that left the audience wanting to dance along.
Cornell Bhangra, who placed second at last year’s Bhangra in the Burgh, came out with choreography that had moments of obvious modern influence balanced with a traditional overall feel. Cornell boasts one of the oldest Bhangra teams that competed, and the members’ experience was very obvious. The performance brought the night’s energy to a whole new level and the crowd roared before the dancers even took the stage. Their timing was impeccable; they truly danced as one cohesive group.
VCU Bhangra, a newcomer to the BIB stage, performed a similarly balanced dance. The team’s set, with its relevance and synchronization, produced a comparably great crowd reaction.
Another exhibition act, Penn Masti broke up the final run of Bhangra performances with its South Asian jazz fusion-styled performance. Their choreography was technical and captivating, at times very sexy and other times emulating a traditional folk dance.
Also demonstrating the influence modern culture has had on tradition, Deewane — Carnegie Mellon’s all-male South Asian fusion a cappella group — performed a short set. The team offered a captivating mash-up of a traditional song and an instantly recognizable ’90s hit —the Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way.”
Performing directly after Columbia, GMU Bhangra’s performance was starkly more traditional. They were the first performance group of the night to bring a dholi, a performer who plays a traditional Punjabi drum, into the mix.
SMD Bhangra Club, the only all-female performance of the night, also came out strong and performed its traditional piece with the most excited and passionate faces seen at the competition. The dance’s musicality was nearly unmatched in the competition.
Last year’s BIB champion, Cal Bhangra, kicked off the second half of the show with an analogous musically conscious and highly entertaining performance. Although it didn’t receive the same roaring applause as last year, crowd members happily watched the heartwarming performance with bellies full of samosas.
A performance by Pitt’s PantheRaas continued the theme of traditional Indian dance, but broke up the Bhangra flow with a Garba-Raas styled dance. Garba and Raas are both traditional Indian dances from the Guijarat and Vrindavan regions of India respectively. Their performance included similarly ostentatious costumes and the dancing had some similarities to Bhangra, but it brought a distinct Indian flair to the night.
While the scores were still being tallied backstage, Carnegie Mellon’s Chak de Bhangra took the stage as many of the performers’ peers cheered them on from the audience. At the end of the performance, the entire Chak de Bhangra family stormed the stage, marking the peak of the night’s energy level.
After the Carnegie Mellon performance, much of the crowd began to file out while the judges were still deliberating. When the awards were finally presented, crowd favorite FCB took first place followed by Cornell Bhangra, the runner-up from last year’s competition. GMU Bhangra secured third place.
Clearly there was no favored balance of tradition and modern influence when it came to the judging perspective, with a modern, mixed, and traditional team claiming each of the top spots respectively. The night featured a great blend of traditional culture and modern fun, creating a strikingly colorful, energetic, and musical experience.

With the holiday shopping season just around the corner, a bubbling craft market set up shop Friday and Saturday afternoon in the Waterfront’s shopping district.
Eighty artists, crafters, and designers filled two vacant retail storefronts with beautiful jewelry, pottery, all-natural soaps and scents, cozy knitted hats, original artwork and prints, adorable baby clothes, toys, and everything in between. The event drew a large crowd of eager shoppers, many of them families with babies in tow, to find special gifts for loved ones — and to try to resist buying too much for themselves.
Ensuring that nobody went hungry, My Goodies Bakery enticed shoppers with vegan and gluten-free baked goods, a stop by Aunt Carol’s Gourmet Dips allowed for plenty samples of tasty dips, and The Sweet Spot came equipped with chocolate to make everything better.
A number of artisans had Pittsburgh-specific products, such as Chuck Beard’s “Abandoned Pittsburgh” photography focusing on old mills and buildings, Carol Skingers’s prints and tiles of a map of Schenley Park, and city-inspired T-shirts by Steel City Cotton Works.
The pop-up craft event was organized by I Made It! Market (IMI), a Pittsburgh-based indie-craft marketplace. Self-described as “a fantastical, nomadic, pop up handmade shopping place,” IMI’s main mission is to create opportunities for Pittsburgh’s artisan community to sell its wares to the public. In the process, the organization aims to create a more cohesive community of crafters that mobilizes to create real change in Pittsburgh through craft.
I Made It! Market is organized largely by business development and communications guru Carrie Nardini, as well as Carnegie Mellon alumna Nina Marie Barbuto (CFA ’06), who co-founded IMI with Nardini back in 2006. Nardini, who holds a master’s in business and a B.A. in English from the University of Pittsburgh, saw a need for business development resources for the increasing number of Pittsburgh artisans and crafters.
The movement toward self-sustaining local economies rather than multinational businesses is not a new one, but it has gained support and fresh energy in the last decade with a renewed national focus on local businesses and the emergence of e-commerce 
sites such as Etsy, an online craft marketplace that facilitates a direct customer-artist relationship. Although there is growing interest in handmade works, small businesses and artisans still have extreme difficulty competing in the mainstream marketplace in large part because they can’t compete against mass-produced price deflation. In addition, many one-man businesses have limited resources to market themselves to a large audience.
IMI allows businesses to get around these obstacles by effectively doing the media, publicity, and organizational aspects of putting on an event to draw shoppers. As a result, a growing movement of entrepreneurial artists and crafters has quietly developed into a uniquely well-organized community in Pittsburgh. 
Crucial to the market’s success has been its collaborative attitude in building relationships with other nonprofits in Pittsburgh — such as the Three Rivers Arts Festival, The Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh, Cotton Factory, and Southside Works — which allows IMI to connect with the Pittsburgh community and draw in a wider net of customers. In addition to putting on craft shows, IMI works with small creative businesses that need help marketing their ideas, making websites, and promoting themselves. IMI also collaborates with groups interested in hosting their own craft fairs by bringing in artists and organizing the events. Workshops are available for people of all ages.
With the madness of Black Friday just around the corner, a focus on buying local handmade gifts this year is refreshing. In a society too often overcome by cheap trends, craft shows remind us of the innate value of a product made with care. The artisan quality, the thought that goes into every last detail, and the personal connection you can get when buying a handmade item is worth the extra few dollars.
If you’re interested in learning more about I Made It! Market, check out its website at imadeitmarket.com and come out to the next craft fair on Dec. 15, “Last Minute Shopping at The Boyd Community Center.”

The holiday season is fast approaching, with Thanksgiving this week and winter break just around the corner. We’re all ready for some time away from problem sets and papers — but as wonderful as it sounds, you can’t spend the entire break sleeping. So give your mind a break and treat yourself to one of technology’s greatest gifts: the TV marathon binge.
But what should you watch? Luckily, I spent the semester staying caught up, just so you can reap the benefits. Check out some of these shows to beat your winter blues.
American Horror Story: Coven
FX
The third season of this show is all about witches. New Orleans sets a luscious cultural backdrop to a story full of witchy teenagers, immortality, and the struggles of life and power. While this installment isn’t as overtly frightening as the first two, it has that spooky tension that arises when things go bump in the night. While you’re at it, go ahead and watch or rewatch the first two seasons, because why not?
Pretty Little Liars
ABC Family
What better way to relax than by torturing your mind with crazy plot twists and turns, only some of which could have been thoroughly thought out? Pretty Little Liars is the perfect combination of a crazy murder mystery and vapid teenage show, the likes of which can only be found on ABC Family. Since the show comes back in January, why not get caught up now while you’ve actually got the time?
Sherlock
PBS
If you haven’t seen all six episodes of this modern-day TV adaptation of Sherlock Holmes, you’re doing something wrong. Each episode clocks in at about 90 minutes, making it perfect TV fare for a night in from the cold weather (or the sunny California weather, if you’re one of those people). The highly anticipated third season makes its stateside debut in January, so start watching now and throw your theories about the show’s return into the ring. If you’re really into Holmes adaptations, also check out CBS’s Elementary. Gender-swapped Watson is a true gift to television and its Holmes/Watson relationship is one of the sassiest around.
Parenthood
NBC
If you want a show that will leave you an ugly sobbing mess at the end of almost every episode, then check out this family drama. So much happens every season, it’s almost like Degrassi for adults. Seriously, if you don’t cry at least three times per season, you might be an actual robot. Plus, it’s currently in its fifth season, so there’s plenty to binge on.
Reign
The CW
Don’t be upset if you start Reign expecting a show that’s accountable to reality or that features less-than-stunning people; it’s on The CW, so clearly you’d be out of luck. But if you can look past glaring historical inaccuracies and frankly ridiculous love triangles, Reign is the kind of brainless, beautiful fun that’s been missing on TV since Gossip Girl ended. Beware, though: Reign only just started its first season in October, so you might get crazily addicted and then run out of episodes to watch.
Scandal
ABC
If you think of binging as watching one, maybe two episodes at a time, then a) you’re doing it wrong; and b) you don’t watch Scandal. There’s a twist in just about every episode, which makes it supremely addictive. If you can stand to watch fewer than five episodes in one sitting then you deserve an award. This season has been especially juicy and makes all the drama of the first two seem like child’s play. If you finish Scandal and are looking for more of that presidential/political drama, check out The West Wing. It’s an oldie, but a goodie.
Parks and Recreation
NBC
The first season is kind of rough, but Parks and Rec hit its stride in the second season and is now one of the best comedies on TV. Amy Poehler is entertaining as Leslie Knope, but the motley crew from Pawnee, Ind., is what really makes this show comedy gold. Who would have thought that the ins and outs of a small-town parks and recreation department could be so much fun? NBC excels at creating strong ensemble casts, so check out Poehler’s partner-in-crime Tina Fey in 30 Rock or Steve Carell in The Office for more workplace fun.
Veronica Mars
The CW
Veronica Mars is a modern-day Nancy Drew, kicking butt and taking names as she works to solve her best friend’s murder and various small-time crimes in her hometown of Neptune, Calif., even while she navigates the shark-infested waters of dating the 1 percent. She’s exactly who you wish you were deep down inside. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, and you’ll cheer on Veronica as she does her thing as basically the coolest person ever. Watch all three seasons and then get ready for the fan-funded movie, coming next spring.
Broadchurch
BBC America
This is the most serious binge-watch suggestion. Broadchurch started airing right at the beginning of the semester, so you might have missed it. The eight-episode first season follows an investigation into the murder of a young boy in a small, rural town in England. It gets pretty heavy at times and is incredibly emotional, so keep the tissues handy. Well acted and powerful, Broadchurch is something you do not want to miss. If you’re into BBC America and want something a little less emotionally charged, Orphan Black was the standout hit from the network this year, and both shows have been renewed for a second season.

Released on his website last Tuesday, Bob Dylan’s “Like a Rolling Stone” finally has an official music video, and there’s a good chance that it’s like nothing you’ve ever seen. Instead of being one video, there are 16 independent videos that viewers can actively navigate, each featuring Dylan’s song as the soundtrack. The video is meant to simulate the experience of channel surfing, with each video a recreation of standard cable fare with actors lip-syncing the lyrics while acting as one would expect given their respective roles. A news anchor sits at a desk surrounded by computer screens and Price is Right contestants spin the big wheel with sparkling numbers. Women from a Bachelor-like show claw at each other’s hair and the hosts of History Channel’s Pawn Stars inspect an old guitar and appear to haggle over dollar amounts.
The only thing that appears out of place among these incredibly authentic recreations is that everyone appears to be lip-syncing to “Like a Rolling Stone” without realizing they’re singing a song. According to a Rolling Stone article, to rehearse scenes, actors would speak authentic dialogue and then the Dylan lyrics would be substituted in at the last minute. For example, the woman hosting a mockup cooking show rehearsed by actually explaining the recipe she is preparing and then replaced the recipe with lyrics once she had mastered how she would explain the recipe. This kind of commitment is evident across every channel and the effect is incredibly surreal, especially when placed in particular contexts such as a reporter covering a resurgence in the Occupy protests and a mockup of the Home Shopping Network. The transition from channel to channel is incredibly seamless, with the actors’ mouths always picking up exactly where the last channel left off in the song.
Directed by 27-year-old Vania Heymann, the music video is both a technological and artistic achievement. The available channels are carefully selected as subjects to be indicted by the song’s contempt. Flipping through, one begins to garner a sense that nearly everything that makes up and defines Western civilization is indicative of cultural regression instead of progression. Our cultural leaders — everyone from politicians to rap stars — are like actors that are reading a bad script. The music video puts these actors up on a stage and throws vegetables at them, with the channel depicting Dylan himself playing the song in 1965 the only one worthy of applause.
Bob Dylan’s “Like a Rolling Stone” — one of many of his songs jockeying for the position of his “signature tune” — was already on the cutting edge when it was originally released 48 years ago, when Dylan, the hero of the traditional folk scene of the early ’60s, used it to shatter his previous public image. The hard snap of Bobby Gregg’s drum kit combined with Mike Bloomfield’s stinging blues guitar is a killer sound, but was only made possible by breaking the ultimate commandment of folk music: playing electric instruments. Bob Dylan bridged the gap between folk and blues and thus changed American popular music for the better by breaking the rules and adapting to the new technologies available to musicians. The music video is a testament to the song’s innovative spirit, and proof that it’s still just as relevant in 2013 as it was in 1965.
Music videos have come a long way during their relatively short existence. On Aug. 1, 1981, the TV channel MTV debuted, forever changing how we interact with music. At first artists opposed this idea, believing their popularity would be based more on how good they looked in front of the camera instead of their music. As the medium matured, however, directors began to emerge that could create videos to compliment a song rather than to create entirely new experiences by themselves. Spike Jonze, Samuel Bayer, Hype Williams, Jonathan Dayton, and Valerie Faris all helped elevate the music video to become something more than a marketing tool by creating short films that truly are works of art. See videos for Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kanye West, Beastie Boys, and Arcade Fire as examples of their work. With his video for “Like a Rolling Stone,” Vania Heymann has pushed the music video even further and has demonstrated the near-endless possibilities for the form. Now the question is, what comes next?

Warning: This article contains spoilers for The Day of the Doctor.
Fifty years of traveling through time and space culminated in a celebration last Saturday for the man known only as the Doctor.
The British television classic Doctor Who celebrated its golden anniversary with a week of interviews, behind-the-scenes specials, a TV movie, and a Google doodle, all leading up to the 50th-anniversary special The Day of the Doctor in the world’s largest simulcast of a TV drama.
The special saw the convergence of three regenerations of the Doctor: the current 11th (Matt Smith), the 10th (David Tennant), and the newly discovered “lost” regeneration (John Hurt). They join together to stop the Zygons, a shape-shifting alien race from the show’s past, as they try to invade Earth to replace their home planet, which was destroyed at the very beginning of the legendary Time War.
The Zygon invasion is only the secondary plot, however, as Hurt’s lost Doctor must face the choice that forever changes the man he will come to be. He must choose to either use the catastrophic device known as The Moment, destroying his race and ending the Time War, or allow the war to continue ravaging the universe.
The Moment has a mind of its own, as it made itself known in the form of former companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), also known as the Bad Wolf. She facilitates the reunion of Doctor regenerations to show what the man will become because of the choice he makes.
Filled with throwbacks to the very beginning of the show, the episode perfectly encapsulates what makes Doctor Who so timeless. There are moments of humor, especially interactions betwen the Doctors, and moments of poignancy, as the elder regenerations reflect on the horrifying decision the Doctor had made 400 years before.
Among the familiar faces present in the episode, Hurt stands out. His characterization of the Doctor as a crotchety old man is the perfect foil to the childlike natures of his later selves. The only disappointment is that this episode is all we have of the War Doctor, as he was called in the minisode prequel released earlier last week.
In the end, all three Doctors — with a push from impossible current companion Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman) — choose not to change history: Together they have the time and power to save their home planet of Gallifrey and all its inhabitants, which forces their enemy, the Daleks, to destroy themselves by accident.
All 13 incarnations of the Doctor work together to freeze Gallifrey in a moment of time using Timelord technology. The result is something that looks like a 3-D painting, which ends up in London’s National Gallery.
The sequence showing the Doctors working together to save Gallifrey includes some major surprises, as quick shots of the ninth (Christopher Eccleston) and newly announced 12th (Peter Capaldi) indicate that every single incarnation of the Doctor is in attendance.
Compared to the narrative mess that was seasons five and six, showrunner Steven Moffat creates a story that feels complete, while still setting up for the future. The episode is filled with the essence of what Doctor Who is, but it’s the final minutes that just about sum up the storied history of the show and give it a push toward the future. Fifth Doctor Tom Baker makes the final surprise, showing up as the curator of the National Gallery and urging the 11th Doctor to search for Gallifrey.
The final shot shows all versions of the Doctor standing together, punctuating the episode with the memory of those lost and hinting at future excitement. It’s a beautiful ending to the celebration of a show infused with hope that has inspired the world for 50 years and will surely continue to do so for many more to come.

Imagine seeing the entire saga of Harry Potter in a hilarious, 70-minute performance with only two actors. It sounds impossible without Hermione’s Time-Turner. However, the muggle production Potted Potter — The Unauthorized Harry Experience — A Parody by Dan and Jeff, which played at Pittsburgh’s Byham Theater from last Wednesday to Sunday, did just that.
Writers Daniel Clarkson and Jeff Turner originally came up with the idea for the show in 2005 when they were asked to create a performance to entertain the crowds of eager fans awaiting the midnight release of the sixth book in the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Clarkson and Turner’s show related the first five books in five minutes. A year later, the show grew to an hour in length, and eventually included all seven books in the performance henceforth known as Potted Potter.
Delme Thomas, who plays every character in the show except for Harry (and even puts on the glasses occasionally), said the show has been an unexpected turn for him. After his agent found the audition, he said, “I auditioned for the piece and I actually didn’t think I was going to get it.”
Thomas has been a Harry Potter fan since he picked up the first book shortly after the first two had been released. “It was the only book in the shop that looked fairly interesting and I got hooked on it from that,” he said. Now not only an avid fan and a Hufflepuff according to Pottermore.com’s official test, Thomas  shifts roles from Hermione Granger to Professor Snape to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
“It’s always fun to play the baddies,” Thomas said. “The goodies are rubbish.” He has been playing both types of roles in eight weekly shows every week since March when he started the tour in London.
“The good thing about the show,” Thomas said, “is it’s a comedy improv show, so you take what you get and roll with it.” According to him, 70 percent of the show is scripted. Thomas and his counterpart, James Percy (who plays Harry for the majority of the show), improvise the other 30 percent.
The two make an excellent pair onstage. Thomas’s contagious enthusiasm and physical humor are balanced out by Percy’s dry wit and adherence to the story line. Percy moves the story along while Thomas keeps the audience engaged, constantly eliciting applause, cheers, chants, and jeers throughout the show.
The improvised parts were easy to identify as unscripted because they occasionally even sent the actors into fits of laughter. “We usually try to make each other laugh as much as possible,” Thomas said. “We’re very professional. It’s the classic two-man comedy.”
Thomas said the most fun part of the show for him was when he engaged the audience in a game of Quidditch. “It’s my moment where I really interact with the audience,” he said.
This version of Quidditch requires less flying on brooms and avoiding bludgers, however, and more bouncing a beach ball between audience members and trying to get it through a lit up hoop while two children (volunteers from the audience) chase the “golden snitch” (Percy in a ridiculous costume) around the stage. It was quite a sight to see grown adults laughing, cheering, and chanting “Gryffindor” or “Slytherin” while whacking a beach ball across an auditorium.
Overall, Potted Potter was a magical experience that muggles, squibs, wizards, witches, members of the Order, and Death Eaters alike could enjoy together. For more information, visit www.pottedpotter.com.

Indie rock band Shearwater had finally made a name for itself with its previous three albums. 2008’s Rook got the artsy, nature-themed band some critical acclaim; The Golden Archipelago built on that success and expanded the band’s instrumental and color palates; and last year’s Animal Joy was the most commercially successful. The album freed up the band’s primitive and primal sensibilities with its Andrew-Bird-meets-Bruce-Springsteen feel.
The three albums contain some of the best indie music produced in the past decade — lead singer Jonathan Meiburg’s voice makes Bon Iver sound like a whining schoolboy — but Shearwater hasn’t yet done anything to put its name on the map. Meiburg and his cohorts are still working on a new solo album to build on their triumphs.
In the meantime, we get Fellow Travelers, a cover album that does little good for the band. If anything, it ensures that Shearwater’s next album won’t receive as much attention as it should.
Granted, the album’s theme has merit. The band covered songs by current influences instead of older ones: Each song on the album belongs to a group Shearwater toured with. Meiburg’s arrangements scream forgettable, however, and so do the songs the band chose to cover.
Fellow Travelers starts out strong, with the closest Shearwater’s ever come to a rock anthem: Xiu Xiu’s “I Luv The Valley OH!!” Meiburg channels his inner Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age, but it’s nowhere near as thrilling or well paced as any upbeat track from Animal Joy.
St. Vincent’s “Cheerleader” wins the award for worst song choice. She has dozens of songs that would be better fit for Shearwater’s aesthetic, but instead they took one of her most well-known tunes and took it too close to the country genre for comfort.
“F****d Up Life” is another subpar track, and offers an odd experience. Hearing the f-bomb repeatedly fall out of Meiburg’s magnificent mouth is like eating pudding from a bowl lined with garlic salt. It’s distasteful and unnatural. The band’s sound is often so pure that expletives sully them, making them seem cheap.
This isn’t to say that Fellow Travelers doesn’t have good songs — David Thomas Broughton’s “Ambiguity” is the simplest, most introspective, and most effective on the album. A repeating chord progression in the harp and a fairly static synth pad are all Meiburg needs to float and toy with lines like, “Such selfishnesses trivialize any tenderness/As the coffee commands the torture of my bowels.”
The drum and bass on a few of the tracks — “F****d Up Life” in particular — may not be processed, but it sure sounds like it. Even for a cover album, this departure from what the band is good at — especially while they’re still developing that sound — doesn’t seem like a great idea.
Shearwater’s main appeal lies in its excessively organic sound. Every song is like a journey through a different expanse of wilderness: a mad rush through the deep forest (“You As You Were,” Animal Joy), a trek over glacial peaks (“The Snow Leopard,” Rook), or a passage through the Strait of Magellan (“Castaways,” The Golden Archipelago). Without the visual and poetic appeal of its own music, all Shearwater has to offer is a pretty voice.
Shearwater would have been better off storing Fellow Travelers away until its next solo album was finished. This throwaway LP ruins the momentum it had carefully built up over the past decade; hopefully, the band’s next venture can put it back on track.

Hey Ryan and Matt,
I was bolting to the printer in Baker yesterday so I could turn in my paper for my next class when I saw this student hanging out in front of the printer just losing it. There was about a book and a half’s worth of printed pages in the tray, and tears were just streaming down her face. I felt sorry for her but I didn’t want to intrude; I just wanted to get my paper and get to class. Am I a bad person for not showing some kind of caring or concern?
Printing Reaction Is Not Totally Qool, Unusually Odious Tryst Arises
Dear PRINT QUOTA,
We recommend against worrying about the printers too much; they take all kinds of abuse throughout the semester. Matt has been known to shout obscenities and kick the printers. Besides, Carnegie Mellon gives students $40 worth of print quota; the printers should be designed to handle that kind of abuse. As for the person crying in front of the printer, she’s probably printing off all of Blackboard ahead of Thanksgiving break so she can get a jump on studying for finals. We all do it at one point in the semester, mostly to use up that $40 of printing allotment. We’re sure she broke down because it finally occurred to her how much she needs to study for finals.
Or maybe she just feels guilty for printing one-sided pages,
Matt & Ryan
Matt and Ryan,
I’m heading home this Tuesday for Thanksgiving and I was wondering if you have any travel advice for me. I want to make sure I make it home in time for food and, more importantly, sleep. I’ve never traveled on my own before, so any words of wisdom are appreciated!
Thanks,
Scared Of Vehicular Escape, Really Young Traveler Is Readily Eagerly Departing
Dear SO VERY TIRED,
Well, since you didn’t mention how you’re getting home, we’ll have to cover all methods of transport. 
A general rule of thumb is to leave earlier than you think you need to. Whether you’re driving, flying, or taking a bus or train, you should get out the door sooner than you think you need to. Especially the week of Thanksgiving. Again, especially the week of Thanksgiving. You know who is going to be on the road? Everyone else in the United States. Your peers, your teachers, your RAs, and everyone else will be conducting a mass exodus from campus starting around noon on Tuesday. You will be but a speck in an ocean of people who want to get home just as much as you do. The line at the bus stop at Forbes and Morewood Avenues is ridiculous. Spend the night there if you have to.
Good luck. You’ll need it,
Ryan & Matt

Hunt Library is currently in a trial period during which it will stay open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The trial period began on Dec. 1 and will continue to the end of final exams in the spring semester. Hunt previously operated under a 24 hours a day, five days a week schedule, and was open from 10 a.m.–9 p.m. on Saturday. It closed at 9 p.m. on Friday and opened at noon on Sunday.
To enter the library during these extended hours, students will need to present their student identification, and will have access only to the library’s first and basement floors.
In addition to the trial of extended hours, Hunt has also implemented other new changes, including an expansion of its current academic journal subscriptions. Journals from publishing companies Elsevier and John Wiley — 1,900 and 1,100 journals, respectively — are being added to the available collection for students. 
A new website will also replace the current VPN system with the service EZproxy to allow off-campus students access to journal articles by spring of 2014. 
These changes are being spearheaded by the university’s new Dean of Libraries, Keith Webster. Webster arrived at Carnegie Mellon in June, and has served as dean of libraries at the University of Queensland in Australia, university librarian at Victoria University in New Zealand, and head of information rights at Her Majesty's Treasury in London.
“What I observed as I moved into the CMU environment is that the student community here is very driven,” Webster remarked, attributing this to the culture of research and collaboration on campus.
“What I see is the demand for greater access to library spaces and access to library content,” he added. 
Carnegie Mellon libraries plan on launching a survey in January, which will be similar to a successful survey that Webster distributed while working at the University of Queensland. The current changes were based on a one-question survey sent to students in October.
“I was quite pleased to see we got hundreds of responses,” Webster explained, noting that many suggestions were for Hunt Library to be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Webster acknowledged that some people were concerned about the impact of 24/7 library availability on student well-being, remarking “I really hope that people will sleep,” and adding, “I remember from when I was a student I enjoyed working late at night and on the weekends.”
The trial will end after final exams in May, but Webster said, “My expectation is that, if everything runs smoothly, [the extended library hours] will continue into subsequent years.”
Additional changes made to Hunt Library include installation of Google Chrome as a web browser on library computers and the diversification of the food options at Maggie Murph Café. 
The library also announced the availability of BrowZine for Carnegie Mellon students, an application that offers access to academic journals published from 2005 onward.
The changes in Hunt Library have been generally well received by the campus community, with junior economics and math major Stanley Krasner saying, “it’s nice to see that more journals are being added. I like having greater access to articles for studying and research.”
Webster said, “This is the beginning of a journey of transforming this library.” He plans to add more group study spaces as well as quiet study areas, as many students need access to both of these areas at any given time. He also mentioned plans to create group study areas that could be converted into quiet study spaces during final exams and other high-demand periods.

Due to the university's dismissive response to a student's sexual assault complaint, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a Title IX complaint against Carnegie Mellon University on Thursday. 
Title IX is a section of the Education Amendments of 1972 that prohibits any kind of gender discrimination in education. 
The ACLU filed the complaint for a Carnegie Mellon student, identified by the pseudonym "Gabrielle," after the university allegedly failed to protect her from an abusive ex-girlfriend. 
According to the student's testimony in an ACLU blog post, she dated her assailant for six months as a freshman, during which her “girlfriend became verbally and sexually abusive." She continued, "I was raped repeatedly and I began to live in fear.”
Gabrielle said in the post that, after the relationship ended, her abuser stalked, harassed, and intimidated her through violent outbursts. Although she did not want to talk about the “more gruesome details of what had happened,” Gabrielle confided in some faculty members about the offender's “verbal harassment and violent tendencies,” according to the post.
Gabrielle wrote that the faculty members organized a “No Contact Agreement” that mandated that the two students not come into contact outside of what was necessary for academics.
During her sophomore year, Gabrielle, who had been diagnosed with PTSD after her experience, moved off campus, but her ex-girlfriend subsequently moved into an apartment across the hall from hers, an act that intimidated Gabrielle according to the Title IX complaint. 
Gabrielle wrote that she also continued to see her ex-girlfriend in almost all of her classes due to the intimate nature of their small academic program. Eventually, she filed a complaint through Carnegie Mellon’s community standards process; however, the process proved difficult. 
"The campus police officer accused me of seeking revenge by making the report and questioned why I had been in the relationship if I was being so badly abused," Gabrielle wrote.
After a campus hearing and an appeal, Gabrielle’s ex-girlfriend was found guilty of sexual assault, but subsequent action included only a review of the existing No Contact Agreement and a counseling assessment. "[My ex-girlfriend's] consequences, however, were not expulsion or suspension, or anything else that would ensure my safety," Gabrielle wrote.
The ACLU argued in its complaint that “once she reported the violence, the student was subjected to dismissive treatment from campus police, who questioned her motives for filing the report and, without notifying her, informed her abuser that she had filed a report against her. The University Disciplinary Committee also failed to address her concerns.”
Additionally, the mutual No Contact order used to remedy the situation was "completely inappropriate in this type of situation because [it] empower[s] the perpetrator to use the order as a possible retaliatory tool against the victim," according to the complaint. 
After the offender was notified of the police report, she followed Gabrielle once more, according to the complaint. The ACLU wrote that Gabrielle feared for her safety and immediately moved out of her apartment upon finding out that the offender was notified of the report.
The complaint states that during Gabrielle's hearing, "Several committee members made comments indicating that they minimized the severity of the sexual assaults because Complainant remained in the relationship after the assaults occurred. It also appeared that they inappropriately sympathized with Complainant's assailant. For example, one committee member suggested that when [the offender] sexually assaulted Complainant, [she] merely had a 'different understanding of events.' "
Holly Dennis, a sophomore dramaturgy major, believes that the university should have better protocols in place for victims of sexual assault and harassment. 
"[The ACLU website] said that the officer questioned why [the complainant] was in the relationship, and I don't think that's a proper way to assess a relationship," Dennis said. "You can't judge a victim. If the officer was working from the beginning with a sexual assault advisor, he would know how to better address the sensitivity of the situation, to not make the survivor feel so alienated. I think the university seems to have blamed the survivor more than they blamed the abuser, which I think is wrong."
Under Title IX, universities are required to properly respond to sexual harassment and abuse. The ACLU's complaint “asserts that Carnegie Mellon failed to respond adequately to the student’s complaints and instead required the student to bear the burden of addressing the effects of the violence and harassment.”  
The Title IX complaint asks the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights to require "the university and its employees to undergo ongoing training, review, and monitoring and to redress the effects of its discrimination against the complainant." 
Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno wrote in an email, "In order to preserve our commitment to protect the confidentiality of those involved in such matters, the university will not comment. We take very seriously our obligations under Title IX and our commitment to provide a safe and secure environment for our students and other members of the university community."
Modern languages professor Dick Tucker said, "As Title IX Coordinator, I was aware of this matter and how it was handled, and am confident that our policies and practices were appropriately and thoughtfully followed throughout."
Other students have had varied reactions to the Title IX complaint filed by the ACLU.
Katharine Carlson, a junior Medieval and Renaissance studies major, wrote in an email “it is necessary that CMU take seriously reports of abuse not just as performed by a man on a woman, but within homosexual couples, queer-identifying couples, and violence by a woman on a man as well.” 
“That Carnegie Mellon failed this student in a matter so grave as security from an abuser is entirely unacceptable,” Carlson continued. “That she was given inadequate protection is bad enough; that she was not taken seriously during the incredibly difficult and frightening course of seeking help, and that her abuser was protected over her is simply despicable.”
Junior professional and creative writing double major Jaime Fawcett said, "Obviously, Carnegie Mellon should report and handle all cases and all situations of sexual abuse and investigate them. They should never be ignored. But I'm also sympathetic with Carnegie, because I feel like there are a lot of different parties involved with the situation — between the accuser, the ex-girlfriend, and the faculty members, other administrators, and the other students that are involved. So I think that the situation is tricky because obviously accusing someone of sexual assault is serious, and it's important to make sure the accusation is viable before taking any serious action."  
Carnegie Mellon's current policy against sexual assault and harassment was updated in April and states: "Carnegie Mellon is dedicated to the free exchange of ideas and the intellectual development of all members of its community. For this exchange and development to take place freely, the institution fosters a positive learning, working, and living environment that promotes the confidence to work, study, innovate and perform without fear of sexual harassment or sexual assault." 
The policy states that those who violate the policy "by engaging in conduct constituting sexual harassment or sexual assault will be subject to appropriate disciplinary or corrective action, which may include but not be limited to dismissal, expulsion, termination of employment, termination of contract, removal from campus, or other revocation of privileges on campus."
The formal sexual assault complaint procedure, after being initiated by the complainant, is managed by Sexual Harassment Procedure Coordinators, and is followed by an investigation led by the Sexual Harassment Process Coordinator and the committee of investigation. The Sexual Harassment Process Coordinator makes the final evaluation, decision, and following recommendation based on the investigation, subsequent to a hearing.
"Students must be safe in order to pursue their studies. It takes courage for those who have been assaulted and abused in a relationship to speak out, and this case shows that all too often, students’ pleas for help are brushed aside," said Sandra Park, staff attorney with the ACLU Women’s Rights Project, in an ACLU press release. 
The ACLU complaint against Carnegie Mellon comes on the heels of similar issues at other universities. At the University of Southern California, for example, 13 students filed a Title IX complaint with the Office for Civil Rights on May 22. One student claimed that she was rebuffed by the university’s administration after reporting a rape because her assailant “didn't orgasm.”
Students at Swarthmore College also filed a complaint on May 22 with the Office for Civil Rights on the grounds that the university failed to “properly adjudicate sexual assault,” according to an article in The Huffington Post. 
At Yale University, 16 students and alumni filed a complaint on March 15, 2011 with the Office for Civil Rights, stating that the university was violating Title IX by failing to respond to several incidents of sexual harassment and by creating a hostile sexual environment.
The ACLU is a national organization dedicated to protecting American civil liberties specifically for the “segments of [the] population that have traditionally been denied their rights, including people of color; women; lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender people; prisoners; and people with disabilities," according to its website. The ACLU is known for cases such as Brown v. Board of Education, which ended racial segregation in public schools in the 1950s and resulted from an ACLU complaint.
The complaint against Carnegie Mellon will only become a lawsuit if all other channels are exhausted, such as voluntary compliance on the part of the university. 
This article includes reporting by contributing editor Brent Heard and staffwriter Chloe Thompson.

David A. Tepper’s charitable foundation recently gave Carnegie Mellon $67 million, the university’s largest-ever donation from a Carnegie Mellon graduate and the largest gift for a building project.
The university will use Tepper’s most recent donation to build the new Tepper Quadrangle, which will be located on the north side of campus, where the Morewood Parking lot currently exists. Tepper’s previous donation of $55 million in 2003 changed the name of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration to the Tepper School of Business.
According to the official university press release, the four-and-a-half-acre Tepper Quadrangle “will be designed to facilitate high levels of cross-campus collaboration and bring together interdisciplinary initiatives, including entrepreneurship and technology-enhanced learning.”
The university’s initial investment for the Tepper Quadrangle currently stands at $201 million. The first building on the Tepper Quadrangle will house the Tepper School of Business. Students in the school of business are excited by the prospect of the new space.
“I think that it’s a great way for Tepper to expand, and keep up its reputation as a highly ranked business school,” said Elissa Maercklein, a sophomore business administration student. “The new space will be good for Tepper.”
Some students are concerned that the new business school building planned for the Tepper Quadrangle is superfluous. “I don’t know why Tepper needs a new building,” said Rachel Fowler, another sophomore business administration major. “Although it will be nice to get a new building.”
Either way, the establishment of the new building is far in the future. Dean of the Tepper School of Business Robert M. Dammon said that the construction will not break ground until the summer or fall of 2015, and will not be completed until “optimistically the fall of 2017, more likely 2018.”
The university is currently searching for an architectural firm to design the building; they have contacted over 20 firms and are planning to narrow the candidates down in the spring semester. After an architect is selected, it will take between a year and 18 months to finalize a design for the building. The building will hold more than Posner Hall currently does — included in the potential designs for the building are a new fitness and recreation space, a dining location, an auditorium, and a welcome center for prospective students and parents.  
President Suresh wants the new auditorium to be the largest on campus, according to Dammon.
The building will also house campus-wide centers for entrepreneurship and collaboration, such as the new Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, formed from a marriage of the School of Business’s Donald H. Jones Center for Entrepreneurship and the School of Computer Science’s Project Olympus.
The added fitness space coincides with the university’s planned expansion of the University Center, which will gain new exercise areas. According to Dammon, Tepper stipulated that the new building contain a fitness center. “That was one of the things that Tepper was very concerned about, the lack of good fitness facilities here on campus,” Dammon said. “So he insisted that if he’s going to give us $67 million, we have to set aside at least 12,000 square feet in the new building for fitness.”
Dammon emphasized that none of these plans is concrete yet. “Since we haven’t really gotten into design yet, there may be some things we envisioned having in the building that we won’t have space for; we may have to move things around a bit. But the plan is for it to be 295,000 square feet.”
The construction of the Tepper Quadrangle also raises several concerns, since the Quadrangle will reduce parking in the Morewood parking lot as well as relocate Spring Carnival.
“There will be some parking under the building,” Dammon said. “Not enough to make up for everything that’s going to be lost. They are working to find alternatives for parking, but they have not decided exactly what to do yet.”
Dammon mentioned several alternatives for parking, including a new parking garage adjacent to the Tepper Quadrangle and busing students from a parking location slightly further away.
Dammon also raised the concern of the current difficulty of crossing Forbes Avenue, noting that the construction of the Tepper Quadrangle is part of a larger university initiative to expand the Forbes Avenue area. “They are finding ways of what they call ‘taming’ Forbes, making sure that the traffic is slower, synchronizing the lights so that the cars can get through and then there’s a stoppage so people can get across,” Dammon said. “The university is well aware that they have to do something on Forbes Avenue. They have to do it in consultation with the city, obviously — we can’t just do whatever we want.”
Spring Carnival, Dammon said, will still be in the Morewood parking lot for — tentatively — the next two years. Although a final location for Carnival has not yet been decided, Dammon theorizes that it will be in the College of Fine Arts parking lot and on Tech, Frew, and Margaret Morrison streets. 
After the construction of the Tepper Quadrangle and the new business building, the building that currently houses the Tepper School of Business will be reallocated for other university departments.
Dammon also emphasized that the new building is not just for Tepper. “People should understand that it’s not just for the Tepper School — there is going to be significant amount of university-wide space. We want it to be very collaborative; we want it to be inviting to the whole campus. So the Tepper School will be there, sure, but there’ll be lots of other things for the university in that space as well.”

Nobel-prize-winning economist and Carnegie Mellon alumnus Edward C. Prescott gave the inaugural Tepper Lecture this past Friday.
The new Tepper Lecture series features distinguished Ph.D. alumni of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (GSIA) — what is now known as the Tepper School of Business — who were invited back to Carnegie Mellon to address the community on their area of expertise. 
Prescott earned his Ph.D. in economics from Carnegie Mellon in 1967 and later served as a faculty member from 1971 to 1980. 
Throughout his career, Prescott also taught at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Minnesota, the University of Chicago, and Northwestern University, among other schools.
Prescott is currently the W.P. Carey Chair in the department of economics at Arizona State University as well as a senior monetary adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Prescott received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 2004 with Finn E. Kyland for their contributions to dynamic macroeconomics: the time consistency of economic policy and the driving forces behind business cycles. Kyland and Prescott onducted most of this pioneering research while they were affiliated with Carnegie Mellon.
Upon the announcement of the Nobel Prize, former University President Jared Cohon said in a university press release, “I am delighted to congratulate Finn and our alumnus and former faculty member Ed Prescott on behalf of the university. They continue a long tradition of path-breaking research in economics at Carnegie Mellon.”
Their papers discussed economic problems surrounding time-inconsistent policies — which cause attempts to stimulate the economy to damage it instead — and the effects of supply-side factors such as technological progress and resource shocks on business cycles. Prescott also hosted a roundtable discussion, which was attended by undergraduate economics students and focused on Prescott’s experiences in economic research. He also touched on different theories surrounding current macroeconomic events.
In August 2012 Prescott was ranked as the 19th most influential economist in the world by the Research Papers in Economics project, based on his academic contributions.
According to a University of Pennsylvania press release, Prescott said, “I love creating models and coming up with explicit structures I can play with,” adding, “Economists create their own worlds. We’re like little gods with our artificial economics, wanting to see what happens.”
Prescott’s lecture focused on his recent research with fellow monetary adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Ellen R. McGrattan. 
Their report, titled “On Financing Retirement with an Aging Population,” addressed the problem of financing retirement consumption in the United States as the population ages and the number of workers per retiree drops. Prescott outlined his and McGrattan’s proposal to “move from current U.S. retirement system — which relies heavily on payroll taxes to make lump-sum transfers to retirees — to a saving-for-retirement system that eliminates these payroll taxes and old-age transfers.”

Carnegie Mellon is going to the Big Apple. By August 2015, the university will not only have campuses in Pittsburgh, Silicon Valley, and Qatar, but also in New York.
The school contracted with New York City, as well as Brooklyn-based production factory Steiner Studios, to create a new graduate school campus that melds technology with the arts. Carnegie Mellon’s Brooklyn campus will give students the opportunity to obtain master’s degrees in subjects such as game design, computational data science, and emerging media, according to the New York Daily News.
The program, entitled the Integrative Media Program, will cater to graduate students interested in pioneering the converging fields of arts, design, science, and the humanities. The Integrative Media Program is one of a kind; as “the first Applied Sciences project to integrate rigorous academics seamlessly into a specialized commercial working environment,” according to a university press release, the program seeks to contribute to the future of technology in urban environments.
“We believe New York City will be the perfect setting for CMU to provide education in these technology-based modes of expression and production — social media, games, special effects, responsive environments, product design and manufacturing — just to name a few of the areas where we will be working together,” said Provost and Executive Vice President Mark Kamlet in the university press release.
“CMU is recognized worldwide for its computer science and engineering programs, but I don’t know if many people are aware of how strong its fine arts program is as well,” said senior design major Joe Oak. “As the cultural hub, New York will be a great place to strengthen the university’s involvement in the arts as well as increase awareness among the creative community.”
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg made the announcement at the Brooklyn Navy Yard last Wednesday. “Carnegie Mellon is one of the great educational institutions in the country and it just adds to the overall intellectual capital of the city,” Bloomberg said during his speech. “Smart people want to be with smart people — they feed on each other, they develop with each other.”
The creation of the Brooklyn campus was made possible by Carnegie Mellon’s winnings in the Applied Sciences NYC competition, which awarded the school $100 million and $300 million in New York City real estate. The program will open in Steiner Studios’ seven-story building at 25 Washington Ave., following a $65 million renovation.
Sophomore mechanical engineering major and New York native Taisha Vargas said, “I think it’s fantastic that CMU is reaching out to the Big Apple. We need to have more of a national presence, and why not start in the capital of the world? CMU would be surrounded by several other well-respected universities, and the opportunity to present CMU as a university that promotes cultural diversity through this program is groundbreaking.”
“We’re very strong in drama and the arts, so we have a huge alumni base that’s here and we’re always involved in activities here,” Kamlet said in an interview with The New York Times. 
“But in terms of yet additional plans in New York, that might be great but there’s not others that are concrete at this point.”
The Integrative Media Program will offer courses through the College of Fine Arts, the School of Computer Science, the College of Engineering, and the Tepper School of Business. The school plans to have 50 students each year — 40 matriculated students and 10 visiting students.

Carnegie Mellon University recently announced the inception of the Simon Initiative, a campus-wide push for interdisciplinary research collaboration and technology-aided learning initiatives.
The Simon Initiative is named after the late professor Herbert Simon, known for his work in cognitive psychology and computer science, and related applications in education.
The Simon Initiative is complemented by a new seed-funding program at the university that will open up opportunities for expansion of education initiatives. According to an official email from President Subra Suresh, “The Simon Initiative will also coordinate campus-wide activities with the Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence and Educational Innovation, the Science of Learning Center jointly administered with the University of Pittsburgh and funded by the National Science Foundation, the Carnegie Mellon Open Learning Initiative activities, and other organizations on campus to connect research on learning with CMU courses and the on-campus experiences of students and faculty.”
The program looks and hopes to combine research, technology, and entrepreneurship within the university, and hopes to unite the university’s technological and educational worlds to help better understand human learning. The initiative will also ensure that high quantities of research data will be stored so that different institutions can utilize them. 
The university plans to create the Global Learning Council (GLC), comprised of industrial and academic leaders, which will share data among various institutions and groups to help create a better environment. The official website for the Simon Initiative states that “a data bank consortia will collect and store thousands of high-quality data sets, accumulate the best analytic methods available, and create a large research community enabled to improve education through empirical research.” 
“This council and the Simon Initiative arrive at a critical time for educators,” President Suresh said in the official university press release. “The world is experiencing an educational revolution, but there has not been sufficient effort to date to address the fundamental question: Are students using these technology platforms really learning successfully? Carnegie Mellon has been studying how people learn with technology since the 1950s; working together with our council colleagues, our goal is to create guidelines and best practices that ensure academic rigor and successful learning for students worldwide.”
The program has received praise from education experts. “Providing a platform that can attract world-class talent and significant public and private resources is a critical step forward,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan in a university press release. “Efforts like this new one from Carnegie Mellon will advance this vital conversation.”
Since the 1950s, Carnegie Mellon has been at the vanguard of the movement to figure out how people are able to learn. Studies have shown that such practices by universities are more effective than the traditional practices used by many schools. The GLC is already attracting tremendous support, and organizations such as Microsoft are showing preliminary interest. Carnegie Mellon students want to learn more about the initiative. Hanson Zeng, a first-year information systems major, said, “I think the Simon Initiative idea seems great, but getting big names into one organization may have a façade of real accomplishment. But until there is action and outcome I can’t really say it’s effective, considering CMU has been in the forefront of tech learning since 1950.”
The Simon Initiative promises advances in technology-centered learning through the GLC and a new source of funding for research and innovation.

The Language Technologies Institute has recently produced several alumni who have implemented natural language processing and machine learning applications that benefit both online content providers and consumers.
Language technologies doctoral candidates Richard Wang and Frank Lin, along with alumni Tarik Raed (SCS ’11), and Brad Barbin (TSB ’11) have launched EnFind, which is powered by technology developed at the Language Technologies Institute. According to Barbin, EnFind is a search engine committed to “making the Web a better place.”
EnFind, Raed explains, “provides readers with an opportunity to learn, view related articles, and make purchases — all from one article ... and all completely free.”
While perusing the Internet, many consumers are easily sidetracked by curiosities that a particular article inspires. Users may leave a given site to investigate these interests and make purchases elsewhere — purchases motivated by the original article. Because of this tendency, content providers are losing out on revenue and consumers are subject to a more sporadic and directionless user experience.
EnFind aims to solve this problem, for both the content provider and consumer. Raed explained, “A content provider wants their reader to be engaged in an article — but ultimately monetizes the engagement through recirculation and should look to optimize this.”
Defined by its founders as a “search engine with no web crawler,” EnFind allows readers to enjoy the information of the Internet without ever leaving the article of initial interest. In order to properly credit initial sites, EnFind places an ID on the consumer so that initial sites can receive “affiliate credit” for future purchases.
So far, EnFind has seen tremendous success. Current data shows a 2 percent increase in articles read by consumers and 25 percent increase in advertisements viewed. EnFind’s technology has recently been implemented in a trial run for the sports section of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. After the successful trial, Raed and Barbin expect EnFind to be implemented across the Post-Gazette’s site by the end of the year.
In light of their recent successes, Raed and Barbin reflect on their formative experiences at Carnegie Mellon. Both are thankful for the inspiring stories of alumni and the opportunities to work with Ph.D. students during their time as undergraduates. In the same vein, Raed and Barbin encourage undergraduates to chase their own unique entrepreneurial visions.

Points of Discussion
The Campus Life Committee is considering putting a holiday tree up in the University Center. The proposal raised concerns during the meeting that a holiday tree could be construed as religious bias. Although the tree would not be specifically a Christmas tree, some Senators argued that a holiday tree is inherently biased toward the Christmas holiday. The Campus Life committee is considering the issue and possible alternatives.
Student Senate discussed the possibility of having college-specific events to foster community involvement in student government. The idea drew trepidation from Senators after last year’s unsuccessful college-specific town hall events. Senators suggested partnering with academic Student Advisory Councils to organize the events.
Senate also discussed communication between committees. Some Senators feel that separate committees are too closed, and need to present committee reports more often. Other Senators thought that constant committee updates would be excessive.
Ex Officio Report: Summer Studies
Maureen Meyer, a Summer Studies student assistant and junior professional writing major, spoke on behalf of the Summer Studies program. 
According to Meyer, Summer Studies wants to form a student committee to give feedback and ideas about the summer experience at Carnegie Mellon.
Committee Report: Campus Life
The Gallery Crawl was held this Saturday, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Campus Life Committee has printed and framed the Spring 2013 Dean’s List; they will hang it publicly in the University Center soon.
The committee also mentioned the potential of putting up a holiday tree or other decorations in the University Center.
Committee Report: Internal Development
Members of the Executive Committee were pleased with the Senators’ feedback from the survey sent out by the Internal Development Committee two weeks ago. The survey measured how Senators felt about the Executive Committee and the direction that Senate is going.

Retailers are increasingly breaking tradition and extending Black Friday insanity into Thanksgiving Day. For the first time, popular stores like Toys “R” Us, Best Buy, and Macy’s are pushing forward their opening times from the early hours of Friday morning to the late or even early hours of Thursday evening — times likely smack in the middle of family dinner.
Typically considered the official start of the holiday shopping season, Black Friday is responsible for attracting hordes of shoppers, aggressively competing for the best deals on merchandise. 
Unsurprisingly, it is the busiest and most profitable shopping day of the year. Last year, Black Friday shoppers spent a combined $59.1 billion, according to the National Retail Federation. It could be considered a national holiday on its own, with its pervasiveness and seemingly bizarre traditions.
There are generally two teams when it comes to Black Friday. First, there are those who embrace it — prepared to wait in the cold for hours, face the madness, and marathon shop until they drop. Second are those who laugh at the ridiculousness of it and shake their heads at this prime example of America’s consumerism culture. Like it or hate it, though, Black Friday has its place.
Retailers have forgotten their place, however. They seem to have developed an inflated sense of their own importance, or have become so hungry for profits that tradition has lost meaning. It is ironic enough that a holiday centered on being thankful for family and blessings is immediately followed by a day dedicated to abandoning family for shops and the purchase of everything possible. This irony turns to hypocrisy, and disrespect, when the former is intruded on by the latter.
What right do stores have to pull people from their families on Thanksgiving? 
Even those who determinedly avoid malls on Black Friday and swear that they would never resort to shopping on Thanksgiving Day will likely be impacted by earlier start times. If the stores are open, people will go, even when that means running out on their families before the pumpkin pie is served. Thanksgiving could be ruined altogether for countless retail workers who have no choice over whether or not they work. 
Stores have prioritized materialism over family values, and customers may follow suit.
The change in trends has disturbing implications. Though certain stores are still holding out against the wave of earlier openings, such as Costco and Barnes & Noble, it is doubtful that they will be able to resist the pressure forever. Increasingly in the minority, these stores will lose out on valuable Thanksgiving Day profits that their competitors are taking advantage of, and will eventually be forced to succumb as a matter of simple business sense. It seems only a matter of time before Thanksgiving will become just another shopping day.
Is there anything that can be done to stop this trend? Perhaps if Black Friday was made an official calendar holiday, its events might be better confined. 
However, sparing more forceful action, people should resist the urge to snag Thanksgiving Day sales. Keep the holiday special — enjoy good food, spend time with loved ones, and be grateful. The shopping can wait until Friday.

According to the Institute for College Access and Success Project on Student Debt, college students who borrow loans will graduate with about $26,600 of debt. According to Gordon Wadsworth, author of The College Trap, college tuition has increased over 2.5 times the rate of inflation since 1985. Clearly, America has a problem with tuition price increases and student debt.
The U.S. is trapped in a student loan bubble, which is susceptible to burst. Like the housing bubble, it is caused by carelessly gifting loans to students who won’t graduate and will fail to pay them back. This phenomenon was described earlier this month by professor Richard Vedder of Ohio University at the Students For Liberty Pittsburgh Regional Conference at Duquesne University. Students are taking longer to graduate, and many are failing to complete their education.
Vedder stated that students are being encouraged by many public universities to take a fifth or sixth year to receive their bachelor’s degree, and 34 of all students percent do so. This prolonged time in college increases their debt and raises tuition because of increased demand.
Ironically, as Vedder points out in a Bloomberg article, “Elite private schools can cost far less relative to public schools, not only because of the top schools’ generous aid, but also because students mostly graduate in the advertised four years, while those at state schools don’t.” Many elite universities push students to complete degrees in four years and deny aid after the initial four years. Vedder calculated that this push caused a median of 87 percent of students in elite universities to graduate in four years, while a sad 25 percent graduated in this allotted time in public universities.
This decreasing graduation rate and increasing debt can be attributed to the idea that a person must go to college to be successful. This idea is far from true. During his speech, Vedder stressed, “We have more janitors with bachelor’s degrees than chemists with bachelor’s degrees.” While this may be hard to believe, the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that 115,000 janitors, 83,000 bartenders, and 323,000 restaurant servers have bachelor’s degrees.
Student loans have constantly increased the demand for education, attracting a large number of people who may not be truly suited for college. After all, academics are not for all and, until recently, were seen as an option among many others. In return, the cost of college education has also begun to exponentially increase, as those who drop out or take additional years make it more expensive for others to attend college and graduate in four years. 
By offering subsidized loans to almost anyone and making students believe that college is necessary, the government may be hurting young adults by making college seem like an inevitability instead of an option.

If you’ve read the news recently, you’ve probably read about the scare over Krokodil. Krokodil, or desomorphine, is a drug that first popped up in Russia in the early 2000s as a substitute for heroin, and is known for its shocking side effects — it leaves the skin scaly and discolored (much like a crocodile’s), and in the worst cases may eat away the flesh entirely.
Given its horrifying properties, it seems unbelievable that use of this drug would spread. However, media outlets seem to take it as given that the drug is becoming an epidemic. One headline by The Huffington Post reads “Krokodil Could Be Spreading Across U.S.,” and one CBS headline warns, “Krokodil use reportedly spreading.” Is it really the case that Krokodil is an emerging threat to the public?
In reality, it is dubious that the drug has even reached North American shores. Although the drug is known for its necrotizing properties, infected IV needles may cause similar effects, creating a number of false positives. One Gawker headline reads “Flesh-Eating Drug Krokodil is Now Attacking Chicago Suburbs,” when the article mentions that only three cases have been reported. Similarly, headlines have been decrying the spread of the drug to places such as Ohio, Arizona, and even Canada, when, in all of these areas, there are less than a handful of cases of the drug, none of them actually confirmed by laboratory testing.
Looking a bit more into the issue, it becomes clear that the fears of an epidemic are entirely unsubstantiated. As an International Business Times article article states: “Experts have said it is unlikely the drug has even really left Russia, as it is only used by people in remote parts of the country where heroin has become too expensive or unavailable — it is turned to as a last resort among addicts.” The article goes on to further mention that there have been no cases of Krokodil confirmed by the Drug Enforcement Administration laboratory.
The coverage of Krokodil is highly reminiscent of the bath salts scare from last year. In fact, it is all too common for the news media to depict every new drug that pops up as an epidemic. Maybe it comes from the psychology created by the war on drugs: If there is a new drug, it is assumed that people, especially drug users, are constantly searching for a new high and are desperate to get their hands on anything to experience it. This particular case of Krokodil may also play to the zombie fascination in society; many articles describe it as a “zombie” drug.
The media needs to stop hyping up cases where a new drug has been reportedly used. It is sophomoric and highly grating upon the collective intelligence of the public to create a panic every time a few random people use a new drug. 
Furthermore, although drug addiction is a serious problem in the U.S., this kind of sensationalism distorts the truth of the matter. Intelligent discourse in the media regarding the war on drugs is long due, although it may take a while before we actually get it.

Students on The Playwickian, the school newspaper at Neshaminy High School in Langhorne, Pa., recently announced that they no longer publish the school’s mascot name, which is the Redskins. Instead of using the term, the journalists circumvent it — for example, calling the football team the Neshaminy football squad, not the Neshaminy Redskins. In its "Unsigned Editorial: Why we won't publish the R-word" — representing two-thirds of the editorial board — the board describes the word as “a term of hate.” Tension between administrators and the board gained national attention when administrators told the board that it had to use the term.
As a Neshaminy alumnus myself, I have only heard the word used to foster community for school-wide events. However, many members of the community rightfully see the word as derogatory given its history.
It is admirable that the board took a strong stance on the use of a controversial word. Furthermore, it is understandable that the board will not use the term in sections like news, based on the opinion of the majority. After all, article style should be uniform across sections.
By banning the word from all parts of the paper, though, the editorial board misunderstood its role as a learning publication within the high school. The Playwickian is a publication that is meant to encourage the growth of young writers and introduce students to journalism.
The board should have made a clear exception for the term’s use in editorials. After all, there is a clear distinction between individuals’ opinions and the editorial board’s opinions. The board was justified in taking the stance that it did against the term in articles that express the opinion of the entire paper. However, it is not justified in blanketing this stance to individuals’ editorials.
While the editorial board has the right to place restrictions on expletives, this specific restriction seems to place barriers between the board and the student body. Students may not be receptive to controversial rules handed down by the board, which may hinder their relationship with the paper. They should not feel disconnected from a paper that can provide a great learning experience.
Especially in a paper in which the work of first-time writers is published, there should not be a restrictive environment over the use of a term that has mixed connotations. This environment is not healthy for fostering a student’s abilities, which should be the top priority of the paper. High school is a vital time to develop interests, and the newspaper’s hard stance on this term could stop some students from exploring an interest in journalism.
When considering the term in individual editorials, the board should allow students to use their own discretion with the term to promote an unrestricted environment for individual editorial writers.

The United States Senate eliminated the use of filibusters for high-position nominations made by presidents this past Thursday. Executive-office appointments may now be approved by a simple majority, rather than by the 60-vote supermajority required since 1975. This change in legislation means that the majority can approve nominations without bipartisan support. This ruling will not affect Supreme Court nominations, or actual legislation.
Democrats — among them majority leader Senator Harry Reid (D–Nev.) and President Barack Obama — believe that this change in procedure is part of the natural evolution of the Senate, and will end the bitterly partisan gridlocks that have dominated nearly every Senate decision since President Obama took office. Republicans, including minority leader Senator Mitch McConnell (R–Ky.), claim that the Democrats have deeply damaged the system of Senate, and muffled the voice of the minority in politics.
While the limits placed on filibusters have the potential to backfire, they are a justified attempt to change a system that has sustained heavy damage from partisan politics. The partisan division of politics has become an extreme problem in U.S. politics, requiring an extreme solution.
The limitation of filibusters comes with consequences, the most glaring being that the change sets a potentially dangerous precedent. Currently, the law has no effect on legislation or Supreme Court nominations, but that could change. Democrats are making a huge gamble that they will retain control of the Senate in the 2014 election. Even if Democrats maintain their majority in this upcoming election, they will lose it eventually, as is the way of politics. Republican leaders have indicated that if they regain the majority in the Senate, they could use these changes to end the Affordable Care Act with a simple majority. The elimination of filibusters is not without its problems or implications.
However, examining why Democrats felt the need to employ these limitations on the use of filibusters is also extremely important. Historically, filibuster reforms have been implemented after extreme use of filibusters. The Senate implemented the two-thirds majority rule in 1917, in response to repeated filibusters over President Woodrow Wilson's preparations for World War I. In 1919, this rule came into effect and ended a filibuster of the Treaty of Versailles. In short, filibusters were created to deal with extremely important governmental decisions; they were created for the big issues.
However, this use has changed over time, as evidenced by the Republicans' filibustering of all of President Obama's nominations for the Washington, D.C. circuit court and other high officials. Republicans who filibustered these positions rarely offered a concrete reason as to why they disapproved of those particular candidates, and appear to be filibustering just to block Democratic attempts at governance, which is a clear abuse of the nature of filibusters. Both parties are guilty of misusing filibusters for political purposes, and the filibuster has strayed far afield from its original intention: to address massively important issues, not simply gum up the works of politics.
Throughout the years since Wilson, filibusters have not been used excessively, though their popularity increased during President George W. Bush's term. According to Mother Jones , during President Bush's administration, Democrats filibustered 38 of his nominees, or roughly five per year. However, that number has seen a dramatic increase during President Obama's term, with an average of 16 nominees filibustered per year — triple the amount we saw with Bush. This is clear indication that the filibuster is being used to hobble the majority's attempts to lead. Filibusters should only be used when the minority party has clear and deep-seated concerns with a particular candidate or issue.
The two most popular opinions on the Democrats' decision to limit filibusters are these: that the Democrats are making a grab for more power — at the expense of the possibilities this precedent creates — and that they are trying to work with a thoroughly partisan and deeply fractured system. Though this decision will certainly have consequences, it was a justified attempt to fix a system that has been scarred by partisan politics.

It’s no secret that Carnegie Mellon has developed a reputation for having a culture of stress. As a result, many students find the need to seek out additional support for their mental health, especially at a high-stress time like the approaching finals period. Carnegie Mellon’s own Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) has come under scrutiny for what some students suggest are ineffective methods for scheduling appointments to see counselors.
In a high-stress campus culture like Carnegie Mellon’s, having convenient and effective mental health support is necessary. CAPS can serve this campus better by taking two key actions: first, implementing an online scheduling system for scheduling both diagnostic and regular appointments, and second, reaching out to students to get their ideas for improving their services.
Academic departments, such as the economics, engineering, and public policy departments already have online scheduling systems in place for their advisers. Students can visit a webpage and see blocks of time available for meetings on their advisers’ calendars. By selecting a block and entering their Andrew ID, students can schedule a time to meet and discuss their academic situation. The same option should be available for students to discuss their mental well-being. The current CAPS intake process involves a questionnaire, which the service can easily integrate into an online framework to make psychological services more readily available.
To better gauge campus needs, CAPS should implement an easy way to collect student thoughts about the service, possibly by requesting feedback or providing online surveys after appointments. A survey is a highly visible way for CAPS to show the student body that it cares about their individual needs. 
Alternatively, CAPS could create an anonymous online suggestion box to accompany an online scheduling system. These initiatives would allow CAPS to easily build trust, which may not fully exist now, with students on campus. CAPS can benefit as an organization and better serve the needs of our community by welcoming feedback and suggestions from students.
Carnegie Mellon must support its students by providing convenient care to ensure that their mental health remains optimal at all times of the year. By implementing an online scheduling system and reaching out for student feedback, CAPS can become a resource to help the campus truly thrive.

How much time do students spend in Hunt Library each year? Whatever the astronomically high number, it’s good to see that library staff care about improving the experience that students have when working within the libraries’ walls.
Carnegie Mellon University Libraries conducted a survey of students this semester, as well as last semester. Staff members asked for suggestions for improvement of the library’s services and availability.
University Libraries recently announced a long list of notable improvements via their website: Hunt Library will be open 24 hours a day as a trial run starting this Sunday through finals next semester, and plans are underway to improve the selection of healthy options at the Maggie Murph Café. The library website itself has been redesigned, and 2,954 new journals have been licensed. The library now supports BrowZine, which will allow students to access scholarly journals and articles from their mobile devices. University Libraries even listened to some of the smallest feedback requests, such as installing Google Chrome on its computers. Library staff also announced that they will launch another survey during the upcoming spring semester, meaning that they will continue to pay attention to the needs of students.
The initiative taken by the library’s staff is truly commendable. Listening to the desires of students is a sign of a responsive and caring staff. Beyond the significant advantages for students in doing their work, these innovations are also an achievement for the university. The library actively seeked student feedback and implemented that feedback in highly visible ways.
Other parts of the university community could help students immensely if they took similar measures with an open willingness to change and better fit what students need or want. This sort of proactive strategy is exactly what Carnegie Mellon should be using in its other initiatives.

Earlier this month, Carnegie Mellon celebrated the inauguration of ninth president Subra Suresh with campus-wide festivities. In the context of Carnegie Mellon’s history, the beginning of Suresh’s time as president is a critical time of transition for the university. 
The campus made incredible strides over the last few decades, and Carnegie Mellon has made itself an unquestionable pioneer in research and academia. Now, the school has an opportunity to focus inward and reflect with the inauguration of President Suresh.
The internal issues that the school has are clear to current students. There’s a lack of school pride; with exams, papers, and problem sets around every corner, students are often pushed to put their noses to the grindstone and forgo the social aspects and events that the school has to offer.
This tendency also produces alumni who don’t necessarily look back on the school itself with fondness. 
Maybe the best indicator of alumni fondness is their lack of donations. According to the Carnegie Mellon Alumni & Reunion Giving site, for every $1 in endowment funds that Carnegie Mellon receives, our peers such as the California Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Stanford University receive $7.68, $9.96, and $11.50, respectively.
While the university makes a strong effort to land students their dream jobs, it needs to go further to ensure that students are cared for while at the university. The university initiated efforts to improve the campus culture with the series of town halls on stress, but those visible efforts have disappeared.
Though these overarching problems exist at Carnegie Mellon, the inauguration benefitted the students and faculty in a real way. In addition to celebrating Suresh, the inauguration did something else: It stressed the uniqueness and community of the school during the ceremony and celebrations. Student talent was also recognized during the campus celebration when they showed off their research, work, and service on the University Center’s second floor. These kinds of events should continue, since they foster a sense of community that isn’t currently present on campus.
But now is time for the school to realize the importance of everyone here: students, faculty, and staff. They are the heart of the university — the heart that is in the work — and they need to be treated with more care.
We can be pioneers in our endeavors and care for our own, simultaneously. Let’s make sure that as we usher in President Suresh, the university takes this time to put more focus on the well-being of students here, because that more than anything will foster pride in the university.
