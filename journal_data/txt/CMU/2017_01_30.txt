The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team fought in a gripping, close game against University Athletic Association (UAA) rivals the Washington University Bears, falling just short in the final minutes of their second game of the season.
Scoring first, the Tartans got to a quick start, but soon found themselves trailing early in the first quarter after several consecutive baskets by the Bears. Neither team’s offense dominated, with the great defense of both sides dictating the flow of the game. The Bears’ stellar defense forced the Tartans to attempt several contested shots and make errant passes that the Bears turned into steals. The Tartans, however, refused to allow the Bears to run away with the same, keeping the score close and ending the first quarter with the Bears leading 17–12.
The second quarter continued the low scoring and kept the defense at the forefront. The Bears maintained their momentum and pulled away from the Tartans, extending their lead to nine points. The Tartans answered, led by senior guard Lisa Murphy, fresh off her Division III Player of the Week honor from the U.S. Basketball Writers Association and a career performance last Sunday, who continued her superb play, leading the Tartans’ attack to put the squad within two points at 29–27 with 1:31 remaining. The Bears responded, ending the half with a 33–29 lead over the home team.
Both teams began the second half with fast starts, trading baskets. Each team gained the lead by a basket, only for the other to quickly tie the game. The rest of the third quarter saw the game at a stalemate, with neither team building any momentum nor willing to give the other any advantage. The third quarter ended with the score tied 55–55.
Entering the fourth and final quarter, the Bears focused on an aggressive attack, scoring right at the start, only for the Tartans to tie the game up again. Just like the third quarter, no team could establish a flowing offense or dominance, with no lead more than three points. However, in the final minutes, the Bears surged, finding the same power they had in the second quarter, and slowly built a lead over the Tartans, going on a 6–0 run and maintaining their strong defense. The Tartans tried very hard, using fouls and timeouts to design a comeback, but could not gain an upper hand over the Bears to clear the point deficit. The game ended with the score of 78–72, with the Bears having the edge over the Tartans.
This game was very close, a competitive contest from start to finish. The Carnegie Mellon and Washington University teams were very evenly matched. Though the Bears ultimately won, they did not dominate the game. The field percentage of the teams were comparably similar, Carnegie Mellon with 39.1 percent and Washington with 42.4 percent. They had the same number of points in the paint (36) and nearly the same number of assists and turnovers. However, the Bears won the competition for points off of turnovers (14 to the Tartans’ 5) and for points off the bench (29 to 9). For the Tartans, Murphy continued her impressive season finishing with 32 points, 11 rebounds, and a perfect 10 for 10 in free throws. Senior guard Jackie Hudepohl added 25 points. Though a loss to a UAA rival at home is hard, the Tartans played with resilience and toughness, battling the equally great Washington University Bears.
With their record now 15–2 overall (4–2 UAA), the Tartans will next travel to St. Louis for a rematch against the Bears on Friday, Feb. 3.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team returned home to face Washington University in St. Louis on Friday. The Tartans fell to the Bears 70–47, bringing the Tartans’ overall record to 9–8 and their University Athletic Association (UAA) record to 3–3.
The Bears got the ball from the opening tip-off, but it was the Tartans who struck first, scoring seven unanswered points before the Bears finally made their first shot to make it 7–2. After a second three-pointer for the Tartans and a pair of Tartan fouls that resulted in two points for the visitors, the Bears capitalized off a turnover to make a slam dunk to send the message that they weren’t going to give up easily. The Tartans settled into patient defense, keeping Washington from converting opportunities before making another three pointer to extend their lead to 17–6. The Bears continued to take shots but found themselves unable to make many of them before a Tartan foul gave them one more point off a free throw. Scoring for the Bears continued to be limited, with sophomore forward and center Patrick Ehland often interrupting Washington’s scoring opportunities.
Coming out of a timeout, the Tartans rushed to make a three-point field goal, but the clocks malfunctioned, causing the points to be rendered void. The Tartans were still able to get 2 points to go up 21–13 before the game stopped again due to a malfunction in the shot clock. A dropped ball gave the Bears an easy two points, and after a series of turnovers, the Bears made another two points despite protests that senior center Chris Shkil had been pushed down. Another shot for the Tartans and two free throws for the Bears later, the Bears mounted an offensive assault that was stopped by the Tartan defense many times. One free throw and another shot brought the Bears to a 23–21 deficit, and a missed three-pointer allowed the Bears to get downfield where the ninth team foul for the Tartans almost cost the Tartans the lead. A lane violation and a miss allowed the Tartans to escape, but the failure to get points on offense gave the Bears another chance. The Tartans fouled for the tenth time, and this time the Bears made both attempts to tie the game at 23 apiece. The Tartans made their way back downfield where two fouls allowed the Tartans to take time off the clock and the chance to retake the lead; however, both free throws missed, and the Bears made a buzzer beating three-pointer to take the lead 26–23 going into halftime.
The Bears got the ball to start the second half and got another shot after the ball changed sides twice. Senior forward Jack Serbin brought it back to 28–25, but the Bears quickly made another shot and to extend their lead to five. After a foul against Shkil resulted in one made free throw attempt, the Bears struck again, extending their lead to 32–26 before the Tartans took a timeout to try and stop the game from falling out of their reach. The Tartans began to push forward more aggressively, drawing another foul that resulted in two points. The Tartans were able to knock the ball out on the Bears’ next possession, and eventually forced a jump ball to get it back. Unfortunately, Serbin was unable to get in a two point shot before the shot clock ran out, giving the ball back to Washington. Another foul by the Tartans gave the Bears two more points, extending their lead to 36–28 before another takeaway from the Bears resulted in a further two points. A missed three-pointer by the Tartans was followed by a made three-pointer by the Bears, bringing the score to 41–28.
After another timeout, the Bears earned two more points before first-year guard Colin McNeil made a layup and an additional free throw due to a foul. After another shot clock expired on the Tartans, the Bears made another three point shot, and another foul by the Tartans gave the Bears two free throws and brought the score to 48–31. The Tartans advanced again and got one point off a Washington foul, but the Tartans fouled again two possession changes later, allowing the Bears to make two more free throws to take the score to 50–32. 
Some time later, Washington committed its seventh foul of the half, resulting in one more point for the Tartans. The Bears then proceeded to make another layup and another free throw due to a foul, making it 53–33. Another foul by the Bears gave the Tartans two made free throws, and the Bears committed another foul shortly afterward which gave the Tartans two more points. Two missed shots later, the Tartans committed another foul which resulted in one point for the Bears.
The Bears pushed forward again to get three points out of a layup and subsequent free throw before making another shot. The Tartans finally answered with another shot to bring the score to 59–39, later adding two more off a layup. Washington made another shot before committing their tenth foul which gave a point to the Tartans. The Bears quickly got down the field to force a foul, resulting in an offensive rebound that led to nothing.
The Tartans tried to quickly get a three-pointer, but they were unable to make it. They were able to get another point out of a Washington foul, and the Tartans later got a quick shot to bring it back to 64–45. Washington made another three-pointer before the Tartans called timeout to substitute all their players. Another three point shot brought the score to 70–45. The Tartans made one more shot before time expired.
While the Tartans were able to jump out into an early lead, the Bears were able to pressure the Tartans with many scoring attempts.
The fouls in the first half added up quickly, and once the Bears took the lead, they moved too quickly to relinquish it. Making the most out of opportunities is something the Tartans were able to do early on, but it was the Bears who were able to make enough opportunities to overcome their early inefficiency.
On Sunday, the Tartans rebounded against the University of Chicago, earning an 89–80 victory that brought the team to 10–8 overall and 4 –3 in the UAA.
The Tartans earned the lead quickly and never relinquished it. The Tartans opened the game shooting 10-of-15 from the floor and built a 25–9 lead following a triple by Serbin with 11 minutes to play. The Tartans maintained the double digit lead for the remainder of the half and led 47–32 at the break.
The Tartans opened the second frame with two quick baskets and led 51–32 29 seconds in, but Chicago scored 14 unanswered as the lead shrunk to 51–46 at the 16-minute mark.
A traditional three-point play by Crawford eight minutes later pulled the Maroons to within a basket at 64–62, but the Tartans responded with a 10 straight points to push the lead back to double figures.
During the run, Maha accounted for seven points. Carnegie Mellon never saw its lead drop below eight points the rest of the way. 
Carnegie Mellon shot 54.2 percent from the floor while Chicago shot 47.5 percent. It marked the third time this season the Tartans shot above 50 percent, winning all three. The program has won 51 of the last 62 contests when shooting better than 50 percent.
Four Tartans reached double figures in scoring with Serbin leading the way with 22 points. Serbin led all rebounders with 11 boards to record his league leading 11th double-double. Junior guard Ryan Maha poured in 20 points and converted 3-of-4 from behind the arc. Sophomore forward and guard Seth Henry and McNeil each contributed with 12 points. Henry earned his second double-double of the season.
It’s clear that the Tartans took Friday’s loss to heart, turning things around on Sunday. They will need to continue to fight hard entering the final month of play.
The Tartans will next travel to St. Louis for a rematch against the Bears on Friday, Feb. 3.

While everyone (hopefully) had an enjoyable break to get ready for this semester, the Tartan II fantasy football league concluded its four weeks of playoffs. Editor-in-Chief India Price’s Plaidie Daddies upset the heavily favored DeMarco DePolo of Zeke Rosenberg to make it to the fantasy championships, while my Dreamland Warriors came back from behind to squeak past Publisher Jade Crockem’s Mr. Rodgers’ Neighborhood. With so much action over these weeks, the final results will have to wait to be chronicled until next week. Until then, here’s a recap of the first round of playoffs.
Plaidie Daddies over DeMarco DePolo 245-213
What an upset! In Week 14, the Plaidie Daddies got off to a massive 153-104 lead driven by Denver Broncos wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders, the Atlanta Falcons defense, and Philadelphia Eagles tight end Zach Ertz. While Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan and Green Bay Packers wide receiver Jordy Nelson gave over 20 points each to Rosenberg, an injury to San Diego Chargers running back Melvin Gordon and poor performances by Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans and the Detroit Lions defense put him into a deep hole that his team was unable to escape from.
While the scoring output for the Plaidie Daddies declined to 92 points in Week 15, DeMarco DePolo was unable to capitalize due to underwhelming performances by Miami Dolphins running back Jay Ayaji, Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown, and Evans. Such is the cruel twist of fate that can befall a team that dominated the regular season but came up short in the playoffs.
Dreamland Warriors over Mr. Rodgers’ Neighborhood 241-231
Crockem amassed an impressive 120-92 lead over my team in Week 14 thanks to the play of Broncos wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, and Packers wide receiver Devante Adams. On my end, Indianapolis Colts wide receiver Donte Moncrief left his game due to injury, resulting in zero points. Other players who underwhelmed with single digit performances were New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald, and Tennessee Titans tight end Delanie Walker.
Crockem’s good chance of victory faded away in Week 15 after a 149-111 score in my favor. Brees put in a strong 29 point rebound, while Bills running back LeSean McCoy and New York Jets running back Bilal Powell finished with high scoring performances as well. Mr. Rodgers’ Neighborhood saw tremendous output from Packers running back and wide receiver Ty Montgomery, Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliot, and Thomas, but shortcomings from Adams and Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Adam Thielen cost the team victory.
Loquacious Losers over extremely trash team 226-189
Layout Manager Abhishek Tayal’s team had the edge from the very start, as his Week 14 performance against Alex Wood’s team earned him a 123-98 lead. While Colts wide receiver T.Y. Hilton and Baltimore Ravens running back Kenneth Dixon put up respectable numbers, the week was over when Steelers running back Le’Veon Bell earned a massive 51 points against the Buffalo Bills, hiding four single point outputs behind a tremendous day for Bell.
The 103-91 edge Tayal earned in Week 15 sealed his victory. Both teams matched up evenly: a strong performance for the Loquacious Losers by Dolphins wide receiver Jarvis Landry was balanced out by Panthers quarterback Cam Newton. A poor performance from Washington Redskins tight end Jordan Reed was negated by a marginally better one from Seattle Seahawks tight end Jimmy Graham. Both kickers also gave their respective teams more than ten points. With nothing to break past what was essentially a stalemate, not even the Loquacious Losers could lose to the extremely trash team.
What is going on? over McManus’s Anus 196-140
Pillbox Co-Editor Sinead Foley may have had a relatively hands off approach to fantasy football, but it was still enough to take down Sarah Gutekunst’s team. Week 14 basically decided this matchup as Foley climbed to an insurmountable 105-54 lead. Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford and Colts running back Frank Gore were the only two players to score double digits for McManus’s Anus, while only two players scored single digits for Foley’s team.
With such a huge deficit, a 91-86 score in favor of What is going on? certainly did not help Gutekunst’s case. With nothing left to play for, it seems both teams were content with letting single-point players litter their rosters. It appears that Gutekunst’s first year in fantasy did not give her much of an edge against the competition this year.
Masshole Knickerbockers over How does this work? 191-163
Like most of the other matchups this round, Lula Beresford’s Masshole Knickerbockers earned their victory in Week 14, crushing Foley’s second team 125-77. Though four players for Beresford’s team scored in the single digits, strong performances by New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, Cincinnati Bengals running back Jeremy Hill, and Bengals tight end Tyler Eifert overwhelmed Foley’s team, which only had San Francisco 49ers running back Carlos Hyde to parade.
While Foley’s team tried to come back in Week 15, an 86-66 margin was not enough to make up for the Week 14 thrashing. Falcons running back Devonta Freeman’s 32-point performance was the dominant performance in a matchup that featured 11 single digit players, many of whom had sustained injuries.

New species of extinct giant otter found in China
Scientists have described a prehistoric otter species that was “two to three times larger than any modern otter,” according to paleontologist Denise Su.
Siamogale melilutra lived six million years ago in what is now the Yunnan province of China and, according to the scientists who originally discovered it, would have weighed over one hundred pounds.
The researchers studied a fossilized cranium found in a mine in 2010 and came to the conclusion that it belonged a previously undiscovered otter species, based on a digital reconstruction and analysis of its skull structure. They also believe that some previously unclassified fossils found in 2009 are S. melilutra specimens as well.
The findings were published this week in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology.

NASA launches new project to study cause of auroras
A NASA campaign launching this month aims to learn more about Earth’s magnetic field through auroras, the stunning polar light effects at occur at the Earth’s poles.
The first mission, named PolarNOx, will study the after effects of the aurora while avoiding interaction with the aurora itself. It will focus on collecting data on atmospheric nitrous oxide, a gas produced by auroras. The PolarNOx rocket launch window closes Jan. 31.
The second and third missions will use two rockets each. Neutral jets — jets that do not interact with the ionosphere — in Auroral Arcs will determine the relationship between auroras and ionospheric electrical fields. The ISINGLASS sounding rocket will fire its identical rockets into two different auroras and investigate how they are affected by the solar wind. The entire project will be completed this March.

Research explains prehistoric Martian climate change
Though Mars is a notoriously dry planet, its surface contains evidence that it was once covered with liquid water — an established fact in the scientific community. However, it is unknown what prehistoric climate conditions caused Mars to become warm enough for liquid water to exist; the planet’s atmosphere lacks enough greenhouse gases to produce a greenhouse effect.
Environmental scientists published a proposal this week that may be the first to successfully explain this climate change, using a principle called collision-induced absorption. They claim that while there may not have been enough individual gas molecules present to create a greenhouse effect on their own, the interaction between these molecules creates a significant amount of heat retention — enough to warm the planet.

Distracted drivers much have lower response times
A study published this week in the journal Human Factors found that drivers in automated cars have a wide range of response times.
The study engaged 26 adults in a simulation with normal driving conditions in an autonomous vehicle. Drivers were asked to perform a distracting secondary task and, at random intervals, they were requested to switch either from manual to automatic or vice versa. The response times ranged from 1.9 seconds to 25.7 seconds; distracted drivers had slower response times, on average.
The authors of the study believe their findings have implications for both road safety and the auto-engineering industry, as vehicle designers try to improve the safety features of their imminently commercial self-driving cars.

Female scientists usually excluded from peer review
An analysis of the age and gender data of over 100,000 scientists revealed that women are less likely to be asked to review publications, as compared to their male peers.
The data, collected from American Geophysical Union journal articles, showed that even though female authors are more likely to be accepted for publication, only 20 percent of reviewers are female — less than the expected proportion, based on the number of women in the AGU.
The authors of the review note that the bias is present across all age groups, thus “the lower participation by women as reviewers is not just because editors were seeking more-senior reviewers, who are predominantly male.”
Female scientists also face bias in award and grant decisions, conference invitations, and hiring and promotions.

Extended periods in space may affect genes and cells
The preliminary data from NASA’s ground-breaking “twin study” suggest that long periods spent in space may alter the human body.
In the study, astronaut Scott Kelly spent 342 days in orbit on the International Space Station while his identical twin Mark remained on Earth. Various biological measurements of both brothers were taken before, during and after Kelly’s year in space.
Kelly experienced atypically large fluctuations in gene-expression signatures, possibly due to the stress of living in orbit. His genes also showed signs of decreased methylation. These effects and their consequences are still being studied. However, because the study involves sequencing the entire genome of both twins, the complete results may never be published due to privacy concerns.

The Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon has been known to carry out some of the campus’s most futuristic and cutting-edge research. This week’s Research Spotlight focuses on experimentation conducted by Assistant Professor of Robotics Abhinav Gupta and his team. Gupta’s research aims to improve the coordination of robots via the use of machine learning and visual learning. The research team and their project will be aided by a three-year $1.5 million award courtesy of Google.
Robots are being used in a variety of fields, and one overarching requirement across the board is that the robots must have dexterity when interacting with objects. This research shows that such nimble and precise movement cannot be achieved directly by hard-coding it into the robot’s central processing unit, but rather by allowing it to heuristically learn how to behave. Just as a child learns to hold different objects with time, so too do the robots Gupta experimented with.
Whereas research groups of yesteryear have suffered largely from data shortage and very expensive robots, Gupta and his team have benefited from the economic advantages of the robotics industry today. “The cost of robots has come down significantly in recent years, enabling us to unleash lots of robots to collect an unprecedented amount of data on physical interactions,” commented Gupta in a Robotics Institute article. With more and more data, combined with mostly isolated visual learning breakthroughs, robots can now use sensory information to understand the ever-changing physical world they occupy.
Excitingly, if one of these many robots learns something new, it can share that knowledge with the others through an adaptable network. This greatly reduces the learning curve and lessens the man hours such experimentation requires. Lerrel Pinto, Ph.D. candidate and member of Gupta’s team, discussed the benefit of this faster data accumulation technique: “If you can get the data faster, you can try more things — different software frameworks, different algorithms.”
Robots that are able to learn and adapt like children, albeit within a slower time frame, are a huge step in the direction toward a more precise artificial intelligence. However, it is this research team’s method of data collection that has the ability to benefit fields far beyond robotics.

The Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation is ramping up for its second-ever Energy Week — a program “designed to educate, inform, and debate energy policy, highlight research and innovation, and prepare for the future,” according to its website. Energy Week will begin on March 27 and end on March 31.
Each day of Energy Week is themed to emphasize the many caveats of discussions concerning energy. Monday is dedicated to the future of energy, whereas Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday are focused on innovation, research, policy, and education, respectively; this allows individuals to attend events dedicated to the aspect of energy they are interested in. The copious activities of the week range from over 40 talks with influential innovators in the field, such as Tesla Motors' Chief Technology Officer (CTO) JB Straubel, to an energy industry-oriented career fair open to all students, trips to nearby energy production sites, and three engaging student competitions.
The dramatic monologue competition is a crowd-favorite. Engaging the university’s arts, the competition “is open to [Carnegie Mellon] drama students who are interested in showing how dramatic words can communicate the concept of energy,” as is stated on www.CMUEnergyWeek.org. Despite several other simultaneous events which occurred during the dramatic monologue competition at last year’s Energy Week, Power Source asserted “none could rival the theater,” referring to drama student Andrew Richardson’s skit depicting innovator Nicola Tesla and his financier J.P. Morgan.
Engineering and Public Policy professor Deborah Stine, who organizes Energy Week, views it as a chance “to highlight all our different energy activities around the campus,” as she mentioned in an interview with The Tartan. Although, the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science’s breakthroughs are widely acclaimed and popularized, the university also pioneers in the energy field, developing cutting-edge and sustainable technology, such as edible electronics. 
Professor Stine believes Carnegie Mellon “is just as active in energy and has a lot of leaders in the field, but [this is] less well-known,” making the Scott Institute’s goal in arranging Energy Week to “increase the visibility of all [Carnegie Mellon] activities” related to energy.
Indeed, Energy Week demonstrates Carnegie Mellon’s influential position in all things energy. Moreover, it shows how the city of Pittsburgh has drifted towards a more renewable, sustainable and futuristic energy industry. This week-long event thus serves as a central nexus for all who wish to gain more insight into the energy industry and research taking place in the region. 
This time around, Energy Week has a plethora of events coordinated with other universities and organizations, such as an energy law and policy forum with the  laws schools of the University of Pittsburgh and West Virginia University. Demonstrably, Energy Week is chance for institutions to mingle and share their ideas about energy.
Last year’s Energy Week drew about 700 guests across all five days, according to Professor Stine. Come March, Energy Week will be in full swing and the Scott Institute hopes that number will rise to 1,000. 
To partake in the week’s activities, register at ww.CMUEnergyWeek.org. Registration is free for Carnegie Mellon students.

DNA is an incredible thing, carrying precious information in a small space to make you who you are — genetically, at least.  
This double-helix polymer carries all the information required for growth, development, functioning, and reproduction for all living things. DNA is made up of four nucleotide bases that pair up with each other – adenine (A) and thymine (T), and guanine (G) and cytosine (C).  In a hierarchical structure, the base pairs form DNA, and the complete set of DNA forms the genome. 
In humans, the genome manifests itself in the form of 23 chromosomes, consisting of 3 billion base pairs. When your cells need to create proteins, the genetic information flows from DNA to RNA through transcription and then from RNA to protein through translation.
With such an important molecule, you may think that the information is set in stone and untouchable, but in the 1990s, scientists began looking into methods to purposefully affect the genome. When DNA is manipulated by inserting, deleting, or replacing segments in the genome, it is called genome editing.
In order to edit a genome, researchers have engineered nucleases, which are enzymes that can cut between the nucleotide base pairs to make smaller segments of DNA. There are currently four types of nucleases: zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effective-based nucleases (TALEN), meganucleases, and the CRISPR-Cas9 system. 
CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat, and consist of short sequences of RNA (called CRISPR RNA or crRNA) that can guide a system to a specific, matching DNA strand.
The CRISPR-Cas9 method consists of Cas9, which is the enzyme that cuts the DNA into smaller sequences, and guide RNA (gRNA), a combination of crRNA and tracrRNA that helps guide Cas9 to the part of the genome that needs editing so it can cut in the right place.
Like DNA, RNA is also made up of four nucleotide bases that pair off — adenine (A) and uracil (U), and guanine (G) and cytosine (C). In order to locate a specific place in the DNA sequence of the genome, the gRNA will have complementary bases to the target DNA, thus only binding to the target sequence. The Cas9 enzyme then follows the gRNA to the target DNA and cuts it in two.
Of the four methods, CRISPR-Cas9 is the simplest, most versatile, and precise method, and was heralded as Science's 2015 Breakthrough of the Year. It can be used to target multiple genes at the same time, which sets this method apart from the rest.
CRISPR-Cas9 (and genome editing, in general) has a lot of potential to help treat medical conditions that are caused by genetics. These can include various types of cancers, hepatitis B, and even cholesterol, to name a few. In April 2015, A team from China attempted to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos, which sparked wide-spread debate regarding the ethics of testing gene-editing technology on humans. Their study concluded that CRISPR was unfit for use in reproductive medicine. Last year, in October, CRISPR gene-editing was testing for the first time on a human subject, by scientists at Sichuan University in Chengdu, China. It was an attempt to treat a patient with aggressive lung cancer, according to an article in the science journal, Nature. 
However, as with any emerging biological technology, there are ethical concerns that accompany this method. There are two types of cells in the body – somatic cells, which are non-reproductive cells, and germline cells, which are. DNA from germline cells is passed from generation to generation. While gene editing in somatic cells is currently relatively uncontroversial, gene editing in germline cells would be passed to future generations and is currently illegal in many countries. Regardless, scientists continue to make CRISPR-Cas9 even more accurate.

Sleep patterns in humans today are very different today from what they were a hundred years ago. They have continued to change throughout history, in both quantity and quality. Studying sleeping patterns across cultures over time is important to understanding the effects sleep has on human health. Thus, researchers are looking to figure out whether this change in sleep was brought about by socioeconomic, technological and political developments or if it is a product of evolutionary mismatch in early human beings’ sleeping patterns.
A paper published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology studied cross-cultural sleeping patterns in an attempt to address this question. 
The study conducted by David Samson of Duke University, and his team analyzed the patterns in 33 volunteers of the Hadza hunter-gatherer community in Tanzania over a period of 393 days.
Such societies are typically under-represented in sleep research studies which predominantly comprise of western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic social groups. The Hazda community represents a small-scale, non-industrialized population that doesn’t have environmental barriers such as air-conditioners, heaters, or sound-proofed rooms that would affect sleep.
The researchers used wrist devices to gather information and found that the subjects slept for an average of 6.5 hours per night despite spending a longer time in bed which averages around 9.16 hours per night. 
Using a scalp device, on nine participants, the researchers also found that the villagers experienced shorter slow-wave cycles and rapid-eye movement which suggests a biologically relatively light sleep. 
As compared to western sleeping patterns, the Hadza community seemed to have shorter and poorer quality of sleep. Besides that, they also took frequent daytime naps for an average of 47.5 minutes. Despite that, Hazdas seemed to have stronger circadian rhythms.
According to an article about the study in Science News, westerners about 500 to 200 years ago had similar sleeping patterns, i.e., two distinct spans of sleep in one day. Thus, this population has a lower sleep efficiency as compared to western, industrialized populations. 
Many other sleep research  studies conclude that irregular sleep cycles and lack of  exposure to sunlight increases risk of heart disease and other health issues. Besides that, use of electronic devices with blue-screens such as mobile phones, laptops, televisions etc. after dark negatively affects melatonin production which delays sleep.
Furthermore, the study concluded that environmental factors such as light and temperature significantly impacted sleep duration and quality. Increased ambient light and temperatures at night were found to increase sleep quality. This observation was interpreted in the paper to mean that experiencing longer days (equivalently more ambient light) and tropical temperatures, implied experiencing longer sleep duration.
Based on other interpretations of the data they collected, the researchers lean towards concluding that sleep plasticity, i.e., variation in sleep quality and quantity has been a product of natural selection in human evolution.

I almost didn’t go. 
Around Christmas, the highly contentious debates I had with my parents about social issues and identity politics came to a point of eruption when I mentioned that I was (and am) a feminist. I had successfully avoided the topic with them for six years, knowing my explicit honesty and progressive stances were unwanted in the house. 
Amidst the yelling and interruptions, my Dad shouted, “If you go to that women’s march, I won’t be speaking to you for a year.” That finally shut me up, because I knew he meant it. But my thoughts kept running. Was he being unreasonable? Am I supposed to choose family over my beliefs? If I chose to go, I would be disrespecting the views of my elders, and causing them to lose face within our community. If I didn’t go, I would be abandoning my own values and morals, and silently implying that I was perfectly fine with inaction in a pressing time of need. The central question was, which one was worse? I decided the latter was and quietly drove to Washington, D.C.
I attended the Inauguration ceremony on Friday, and wedged myself between Trump supporters and protesters on Pennsylvania Ave across the street from the Trump International Hotel. Primarily looking to snap a few good pictures of the historic moment, I quickly began to realize how uncomfortable I was about the situation. Trump’s voice permeated the area, his words slightly distorted by the overhead speakers. The dismal weather cast a washed-out and pale look to people’s faces. Many fights broke out, eruptive and intense like firecrackers placed randomly along the blocks. Looking up at the American flag, I feared for the country’s future and overall well-being of its citizens. I witnessed individuals, incapable of rational and civil behavior, instead preferring to exacerbate the hostile environment. They jeered and intimidated others, and oftentimes engaged in physical altercations. They looked like strangers to empathy. I think that’s what scared me the most. Whatever idea I initially had that this event would provide didactic potential and enlighten me on issues I overlooked died. 
On the other extreme was my experience at the Women’s March the very next day. Being a part of the nation’s largest one-day protest in history was empowering and up-lifting. Standing in the Dupont Metro while watching carts loaded with women, men, and children warmly dressed, I knew the turnout rate would be far greater than I initially expected. I stepped onto the National Mall crowded with kindred souls, streams of people headed towards the various rallies and music installations that blared from a distance. I would hear intermittent cheers and roars of celebration as I squeezed my way through, eager to catch a glimpse of the action. 
My arms ached from holding my sign, demonstrating the years of athletic inactivity I've encountered. My back ached from the hours of standing I did the day before as well. I didn’t really care, though. Initially disheartened by the apparent misalignment of America’s values shown by the outcome of this election, I found solace in marching alongside 500,000 other people who had not forgotten about the importance of the equal, fundamental rights we deserve, protected by the principles of our nation. I felt the power of an effort that will be in it for the long-haul, a movement that stands in solidarity for the protection of women’s rights, health, and safety. 
The spirited people surrounding me echoed this message in a myriad of ways. Some angrily, some joyfully, some just wanting to add humor, to shed some light following a dark day. Eager to denounce the billionaire Republican President whose attention on women is likened to that of a rapist, people held signs with clever slogans that were peppered throughout the crowd. Some of the highlights were “We shall over comb,” “Trump is the BLOTUS: Biggest Liar of the United States,” and “It’s not the Bill of Suggestions," among other (more vulgar) phrases. Feminist icons like Gloria Steinem, Cecile Richards, and Alicia Keys not only attended the march but also spoke at the rally, reinvigorating the audience with preachings of their visions of a better, more equal world for our children. The long crowd made its way to the White House and then beyond, inevitably spilling into streets not even planned for the march. Individuals really couldn’t escape the crowd, much less ignore the message we were delivering.  I chanted, “This is what democracy looks like” and “our bodies our rights” until my voice broke. And although I was often lost in the sea of people, pink hats, and handmade signs, I never felt drowned out or forgotten. 
However, I am well aware of the shortcomings of the Women’s March. In its effort to collectivize and brand itself, the march has inadvertently left out key players of the community. It has received backlash for the pink, cat-eared hats worn during the march, popularly labeled as the “p**** hats,” as the vagina is not a fitting symbol for those who identify as female but don’t have one. I personally saw that many disabled people struggled to enjoy the moment as much as others, their wheelchairs stuck in the same place as marchers carried on, disregarding them. 
Some activists, notably Angela Peoples, took the opportunity to point out the distinct polarity between white women and black women that undoubtedly marked the 2016 election. In her viral photo, Peoples holds a sign that reads, “Don’t forget: White women voted for Trump.” Her stoic demeanor provides a stark contrast to the white women wearing the pink “p**** hats” whose attention on their phones and selfies epitomize the attitudinal divide between the two demographics. Many women of color contended that failure to address these disparities will make them invisible in the movement. Their views are valid: often times movements meant to elevate the rights of those more vulnerable to prejudice and discrimination prioritize the voices of women who are able-bodied, straight, white, and cisgendered. We should constantly make provisions for the diverse nature of women in the U.S. and around the world when advocating for our rights. If we normalize such conflicting behavior, we would be exposed to our own hypocrisy. 
The new administration needs to be reminded that the citizens they were sworn to dedicate their service to include people of all ethnicities, backgrounds, race, sexual orientation, religion, class, etc. Diversity is our strength. Women are our strength. Protect the rights of those who are most vulnerable. Don't be an a******.

Classy. Honest. Innovative. Those are the three words that best describe Carnegie Mellon’s all-male, award-winning a cappella group, The Originals. Classy, because of each member’s evident poise and charm; honest, because of the genuine passion and soul they bring to their songs; and innovative, because their performances are for sure unlike anything you’ve ever seen or heard before. Getting to spend some time with them before their Thursday night rehearsal really helped me get to know the group better. Before my meeting with The Originals, I didn’t know too much about them or the world of a cappella. I entered their rehearsal room in McConomy Auditorium having absolutely no expectations. 
While walking down the stairs of the auditorium, I was right away greeted with a friendly “hi” from one of the members, Leo Galvan. He seemed to be the only one in the room at the time. As I took a seat, a few more members of the group came from the side doors, laughing and talking with each other; I could already get a strong sense of their supportive and brotherly group dynamic. They all welcomed me, and they were very excited to promote their upcoming performance on Tuesday, Jan. 31 at 8 p.m., where they’ll be opening for the hit a cappella group, MIX. MIX is a co-ed a cappella group from the University of Colorado Denver that has won many awards, including first place in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA). They’re currently touring around Pennsylvania on their PA Takeover Tour, and excitingly one of their stops is right here on campus in the Cohen Center's Rangos Ballroom. Leo Galvan, a sophomore tenor in The Originals, commented on having the opportunity to open for such a successful group like MIX: “We’ve actually never opened for a professional a cappella group, and this is really an amazing opportunity to talk and interact with and see people who do this for a living […] it’ll actually be such an incredible experience and we’re really excited to share it with the community.”  Sophomore JP Leigh, who does vocal percussion for the group, also talked a bit about how sharing the stage with MIX will benefit their work: “It’s always good for us to see other a cappella groups to help us improve, because we’ll maybe see something inspirational from them that we can put into our future performances. What goes along with watching and enjoying it, it’s also an educational experience.”
As more and more members of the group began to arrive for rehearsal, I started getting a much clearer picture of the family-like bond The Originals share with one another. There are eleven members in the group, all representing different grades, with two fifth-years, three juniors, three sophomores, and three first-years. The underclassmen look up to the upperclassmen, and they all treat each other like brothers. The group dynamic was one of the reasons why first-year Ben Stern, a baritone in the group, decided to join The Originals last semester. “They’re really a great group of guys. We’re all happy and it’s like a family here.” Already having a sense of The Originals’ fun and friendly personalities, I couldn’t wait to watch them rehearse a bit of their performance for Tuesday. 
The group started off rehearsal with some vocal warm-ups. Now, this was my very first time ever seeing an a cappella group perform live, and I was honestly left speechless from just hearing The Originals practice harmonies. Once they began rehearsing two of their songs for Tuesday’s performance, renditions of "Home Alone" by Ansel Elgort and "Closer" by The Chainsmokers, I actually wanted to start singing along with them. You could really feel the passion and energy they gave to their singing, and their stage presence really made it clear that each and every member loves what they’re doing. For The Originals, it’s all about conveying passion, honesty, and getting a message across to their audience. Nitsan Shai, a Fifth Year Scholar and baritone in the group, talked more about the group’s sound: “We really pride ourselves in performing very honestly. If there’s a song that has a lot of meaning to us, we try to project that as much as we can emotionally in a performance.” Earlier, the group had even recalled a recent performance in Atlanta, Georgia that “challenged gender and masculinity standards,” where one of the members, sophomore baritone Ramsey Pack, dressed up in drag during a performance of Beyonce’s "I Care". “It was a statement piece where everyone around us was represented, the masses that help out and support the LGBTQ community. We made that statement and after everyone came up to us and was like ‘We really appreciated how honest you were in your performances,” Leo explained. “What we put out on stage is what comes from our hearts and what we really believe." 
Besides their singing, another way in which the group is able to speak to their audiences is through their choreography. Leo elaborated on that by referring to another one of their songs they’ll be performing on Tuesday, "Cellophane" by Sia: “For Cellophane, it actually tells the story of mental illness, so we have a lot of cage-like choreography moves. And basically it helps us tell the story, even beyond the song. What the song can’t tell, we tell with our bodies.” Unfortunately I was unable to see their choreography during rehearsal, but it definitely sounds like they’ll be putting on a powerful performance. 
It was an absolute pleasure getting to spend time with The Originals, and I have no doubt that the group and their audience will have an amazing time on Tuesday. It will surely be an experience like no other to watch a live a cappella performance, especially from two very talented groups. Tickets for the show are available online at [SLANT12]carnegiemellontickets.com[SLANT12] or at the door Tuesday night for ten dollars. It’s an opportunity you won’t want to miss.

Sidewalks of paranoid locals study me. A rough man grips a large, nearly empty bottle. I struggle to make eye contact. He lifts his vice and slurs, "D'ya know what this's for?" He throws it to the ground. Glass shrapnel pegs my shoes. He is now out of alcohol. I keep walking. Loiterers on the opposite side of the street blast peculiar music: Black Sabbath's "Nativity in Black." Recognizing the opening bassline, I stop. The street ends with a glass entrance. I open the doors to a colorfully dim binge where N.I.B. is inexplicably louder. I weave through the crowd as Lucifer sings his mantra: "please take my hand." A tall, gothic woman rushes towards me. Startled, I notice a second set of doors, but my putty hands are useless. My body becomes numb. The room spins, and I sink to the floor as the final guitar solo blares in full effect. Holding a syringe, the woman approaches me and coldly utters, "I don't know why you do this to yourself," as she injects me.

Silence is a new film directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, and Liam Neeson, based on the 1966 novel of the same name by Shūsaku Endō. The story centers around two Jesuit priests in the 17th century sent from Portugal to Japan in order to spread their faith. It was shown by Pittsburgh Filmmakers at the Harris Theater, and is now playing at AMC Loews Waterfront 22.
Recently, the idea of a “happy ending” has become tenuous. From where I stand, and in the news I read and hear, the notion that the moral arc of the universe must bend, eventually, toward the light has become a bit difficult to swallow. I think I’ve believed that concept, without too much consideration, for my whole life. I’d go as far as saying that most people surrounding me through the years have had this subconscious faith as well: that although shadows will inevitably cross our paths, the story can never culminate in anything other than triumph, confident and untouched by doubt.
Many of us are raised to believe in watchful eyes and attentive ears, something bigger than us guiding that moral arc, caring for us. It can be “God,” but call it what you will. We wrap ourselves up in the warm security of a divine purpose, and many of us may never be given a reason to doubt. In Silence, Garfield’s character, Father Sebastião Rodrigues, is one who could easily have felt this unconcerned security in faith until he died, had he never been compelled to leave Portugal. But instead, he and fellow Jesuit Father Francisco Garrpe, played by Driver, in an effort to rescue a priest, played by Neeson, lost in his mission to an anti-Christian nation, set sail for Japan. The year is 1639.
The film is spent in quiet, the first hour made to feel arduous, uncomfortable, long. From the moment the priests set foot in Japan, expectations are raised and shattered, reflecting the experience of these men of extreme faith. In a land entirely strange to them, the discomfort of an ascetic life is only the most superficial beginning to how they will be tested. But even the idea of “testing” becomes questionable. Who is doing the testing? If it is God, then is every event a reflection of his will? If these men are here on a truly holy mission, then how does one explain the horrors they unintentionally inflict upon innocent strangers? And with all these questions pounding relentlessly in their minds, the absence of revelation becomes increasingly intolerable. The unanswered deaths of good people are underscored by nothingness, the camera itself giving the impression of a casual, uncaring observer to this extreme drama.
As Endō describes in the original novel, “Behind the depressing silence of this sea, the silence of God ... the feeling that while men raise their voices in anguish God remains with folded arms, silent.”
To my mind, there were very few films released this past year that matched Silence in its ability to speak truth to the human condition. Scorsese’s obsession with adapting the 1966 novel, a mission he shouldered for decades, picks him out as one of the most interesting spiritual investigators in film today. Silence has been compared to another recent, well-received movie, Mel Gibson’s Hacksaw Ridge, also starring Garfield. What I gather about the comparison applies if you compare Silence to any number of other spiritually-minded movies: Silence is uniquely ambiguous. The movie submits questions and issues which get progressively more complicated and challenging as the story moves forward, only to end in ellipsis.
The thought of an alternate universe where Father Rodrigues stays in Portugal and continues to emulate Christ with impunity, zealously spreading the word he loves so sincerely, is an exceptionally relevant point. Within certain communities, it is entirely possible to believe in the simple, moral righteousness of the universe. What appeals to me so dearly about Silence is its admission that reality is not nearly so simple. Our platitudes and notions that bring us comfort can be helpful, of course, but it’s ridiculous to imagine that the world is so straightforward. How do we allow inarguable tragedy into our belief systems? How does our view of the universe cope when faced with purposelessness?
Silence does not provide the answers. This is not a detriment to the movie, but rather an enormously mature attribute. Although additionally full of hope and happiness, the world is an inevitably difficult place, and we do it a disservice to pretend that the right path will always, ultimately, be taken. We do ourselves a disservice to think that it’s not worth critically thinking about our actions and the grey area of consequences that result. Silence compels us to understand that, although God or meaning could exist, whatever it is will never guide us so assuredly by the hand.

It is the second night of the Columbus, OH-based musical duo Twenty One Pilots’ Emotional Roadshow World Tour, and flocks of cars slowly inch their way to the Webster Bank Arena in Bridgeport, CT on Jan. 18.  I walk up to the entrance and see empty water bottles as the remains of teenage girls’ efforts spent waiting in the General Admission line, waiting for the chance to see this revolutionary band bring their “ukulele screamo,” “schizophrenic pop” music to my hometown.
Performing before the alternative hip-hop duo was alternative bluegrass folk rock band, Judah and the Lion.  With their banjos strumming, the band refused to show anything but their true selves, performing covers of T-Pain’s “Booty Wurk (One Cheek at a Time),” complete with twerking, and The Killers’ tried-and-true classic “Mr. Brightside” with their own hits from their latest album Folk Hop ‘N Roll.  The band brought an Imagine Dragons-like vibe to their voice and music, making them an unexpectedly pleasant, odd, yet wonderful surprise.  Before playing their last song “Take It All Back,” the band thanked Twenty One Pilots for the invitation to tour with the band, praising how their alternative and unique brand of music helped pave the way for similar artists to break out to wider audiences, and for burgeoning musicians to explore more of the vast realms of music.
Fellow breakout budding musical act and American rapper and hip-hop artist Jon Bellion took the stage next with Travis Mendes.  Bellion’s recent fame comes from his hit “All Time Low,” which had just hit Platinum at the time of the concert.  He brought even more excitement to the huge crowd, performing hits from his latest album The Human Condition.  Travis Mendes accompanied Bellion as the latter freestyled, and Mendes provided smooth vocal accompaniment and chemistry to Bellion’s dance moves and style.  Bellion was also extremely thankful to Twenty One Pilots for the last minute addition to the tour, saying “it was only the second night of the tour and it already had felt like we had become best friends.”
When Twenty One Pilots finally made an appearance on stage after what felt like ages to the fans around me, they refused to disappoint.  Throughout the night, they kept the audience riding a huge high, incorporating the pit crowd in their crazy stunts that ranged from crowd-surfing with a giant hamster ball to playing drums in the crowd, truly making the audience a part of the experience.  They performed a mix of songs from their most recent hits “Heathens” and “Ride” to some of their older classics like “Ode to Sleep.”
Other highlights included a moving cover of My Chemical Romance’s “Cancer,” mixing the moving and emotional roots of the original song with their own style, creating a heartfelt masterpiece. The duo also brought back Judah and the Lion and Jon Bellion on stage for a few covers, including the Blackstreet classic “No Diggity,” The Black Eyed Peas’ “Where is the Love,” and House of Pain’s “Jump Around.”
Twenty One Pilots' songs are not just rap and hip-hop.  They’re rap, alternative, hip hop, rock, even pop, and they fuse these genres to create music that’s alluring, unique, and wholly original in a time where it’s difficult to stand out in the music industry.  And that individuality has created a wave of change in its wake. Yet throughout the whole creation and sudden rise to fame, the duo has always remained humble and thankful, hoping that their audience — whether it be two people or two million people — enjoy their show.

“How can you be a revolutionary when you’re so busy being a traditionalist?”
La La Land challenges it’s viewers to put themselves in the shoes of Seb, portrayed by Ryan Gosling, and ask themselves this question. In the movie, Keith (played by John Legend) uses this question to taunt Seb, convincing him that the route to making genuinely revolutionary music is breaking free from his purist Jazz roots. 
The same question applies to movies themselves. In an industry dominated by mass marketed franchises on one side, and expansive sociopolitical musings on the other, is there room for a good old fashioned musical? In an era when ‘great’ and ‘different’ have become practically synonymous, can a simple love story — the relatable kind, that has been told a million times before — possibly be considered revolutionary? La La Land is evidence that some tropes never go out of fashion.
For all the hype and noise around it, what struck me most about La La Land was the raw, unsophisticated joy to be had within it. The protagonists are Seb, a struggling Jazz pianist and Mia, played by Emma Stone, a struggling actor. La La Land is the story of their relationship, from it’s sexy beginning to it’s bittersweet conclusion. 
Set against the backdrop of the stunning Los Angeles, the movie paints its leads as flawed dreamers — fighting for a break in Jazz music and acting, both brutally unwelcoming industries, with little more than sheer talent and a deep, inspiring passion for their respective fields. Watching Seb sit down at a piano and convey more through melody than words could ever capture, we are introduced to his understated, under-appreciated genius. Later on, Mia toils away, day and night, on a play she writes, organizes, and is the sole cast member of, even without the guarantee of an audience.
Through his leads, director Damien Chazelle plumbs human nature to explore why some of us follow our dreams with such a passionate fervor. Why do we persist, even when the odds are thoroughly stacked against us? La La Land tells us that as great as romantic love is, the greater love is a love of ideals, which translates into a love for work and ambition.
La La Land may be simple, but not simplistic. The movie’s visual aesthetic is arguably the most unique since 2009’s Avatar. Every single shot is composed in a way that can only be described as a live painting. The city of Los Angeles is Chazelle’s canvas, and he washes it in soft pastel hues, that serve to humanize the glamor and ethereality of Hollywood. The cinematography and color grading lend a poetic and overwrought sense of beauty to the proceedings. When Seb and Mia finally kiss at Griffith Observatory, the entire scene is perfect, as if that moment was long written in the stars.
The music and choreography use technology to liven up a traditionalist ethos effectively. The movie opens with a massive musical number in the middle of a Los Angeles freeway. This scene, shot outdoors on a busy thoroughfare, is full of long cuts and fluid camera motion capturing literally hundreds of extras. This is impossible without the relatively lightweight, mobile digital cameras that modern directors often use for large outdoor scenes. Another iconic scene, Mia and Seb’s first dance, is shot on location in Griffith Park at night. The spectacular sunset backdrop and lighting effects that make the scene pop would be impossible in low light, without the digital color grading that is brilliantly applied in post production.
The songs themselves tell a similar story. They are reminiscent of musicals from the 30s and 40s — slick, simple and just a little pulpy. And yet, it all seems sharpened and enhanced with modern sensibilities and recording techniques. Both leads are good singers, and that Ryan Gosling as a pianist is a revelation. The melodies themselves toe a fine line between authentic Jazz and cross cultural appeal, as is expected with film soundtrack music.
For all it’s overwrought emotion, La La Land works best in its subtler moments — Seb hopelessly trying to negotiate his setlist with a by-the-books restaurant manager, Mia intentionally requesting he play an out and out commercial song to bug him, or Seb turning around to walk back to his car after spending 10 minutes walking her to hers. La La Land, through its simple boy-meets-girl, dreams and ambitions story, reminds us why we go to the movies in the first place.

Dear Sarah,
Yesterday when I woke up, I went to check the news, as I always do, on Facebook trending. I was prepared for just another sign of the apocalypse, but the one that I got shook me to my core.
Wet Seal will close all of its locations. No one could have seen this coming. I've been shopping there to stay at the forefront of sugar baby fashions ever since my parents gave me my first AmEx. When this season's Wet Seal goes out of style, I don't know what I'm going to do. I need to transition to a new line by summer without missing a beat. What are my options?
Sincerely,
Rest In Panties
Dear RIP,
Girl, I know exactly how you feel. Facebook trending really ruined my day with this one. We sugar babies have to stick together through this. I've planned the ultimate shopping trip, only requiring one quick bus trip.
Start out in Oakland on Forbes Avenue at the hottest spot in the neighborhood: Rue21. You may have to push through crowds of Pitt students getting after the latest in choker trends, but it's worth it. Then walk just a block and a half to catch the 75 inbound from Fifth and Atwood, then get your little booty off at Sidney and S. 28th and you're basically at Forever 21. Shop till you drop, but if you don't drop, you're still walking distance away from Urban Outfitters, H&M, American Eagle, and BCBG!
Try not to max out!
Sarah
Dear Sarah,
I'm feeling really stressed about this first 112 lab, and all I want in the whole world is a pint of Ben and Jerry's Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch. I really want to go to Entropy+ and blow my DineX on it. The crunchy, rich pseudo-caffeination calls my name from across Forbes, singing sweet songs of sweeter dairy-induced comas. The only problem? It is too freaking cold to go outside right now, let alone over three times the recommended daily value of fat and sugar from the frozen section.
My heart and soul need the ice cream. This lab is like a dementor, sucking out every positive feeling I can muster, creating a hole in me that is exactly Ben and Jerry's shaped. But I get full-body chills just thinking about bearing the elements for a block of ice. What should I do?
Sincerely,
Seriously Troubled and Upset Coding Kid
Dear STUCK,
You know what you need to do. There is no question that you must embark on this mission, but it will require much preparation. If it ever seems to difficult, just think of that pint of coffee crunch goodness at the end of the journey, because it needs you almost as much as you need it.
First, you must put on three layers of the warmest clothing you possess. Second, you must do at least three minutes of jumping jacks — however long it takes to work up an intense sweat that cannot escape your poly-blend cocoon. Finally, put on your coat, hat, gloves, and boots. And don't forget your ID. Now, you are ready for whatever may lie ahead, muscles warm enough to jog if need be, and body temperature elevated enough to almost enjoy the chill. I know exercise can be difficult, but if you're about to eat that much ice cream, you're really doing yourself a favor.
Or should I say, flavor?
Sarah

In keeping with Carnegie Mellon University’s rich tradition of excellence in robotics, an independent institute founded by the university was awarded more than $250 million in order to create an advanced robotics manufacturing institute in Pittsburgh. This announcement was made by the Department of Defense (DoD) on Friday, Jan. 13.
The money is a mixture of public and private money, with $80 million coming from the DoD and an additional $173 million coming from partner organizations. The  public-private Manufacturing USA institute was gifted to American Robotics, a Carnegie Mellon-led nonprofit venture with more than 220 partners in sectors all across the nation, including industry, academia, government, and nonprofit. The Richard King Mellon Foundation, a group dedicated to securing the future of South-western Pennsylvania, was instrumental in the process of creating the proposal.
This high-level award is a step that puts Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh on the path to becoming a central part of technological advancement in terms of manufacturing, artificial intelligence, autonomy, and 3D printing. In order to be at the forefront of this new wave of emerging technologies, the funding will allow American Robotics to make industrial robotics more affordable for both big and small businesses. Furthermore, they will be adaptable to many uses, allowing companies to achieve more in less time, and at increased efficiency.
Many government officials predict that manufacturing on this scale will introduce a new generation, one in which the nation potentially experiences an influx of new jobs and fueled economic growth, putting the U.S. squarely in the lead on advanced manufacturing.
“This new institute will provide significant benefits to the region and the nation, while creating enormous opportunities for [Carnegie Mellon] scholars and researchers, and new momentum for the university,” President Subra Suresh said in a university press release. “The institute, in return, will benefit from [Carnegie Mellon]’s expertise in technology, as well as its strengths in policy, ethics, and human interfaces that will ensure that new technologies work to benefit humankind.”
Among the several university faculty members who led the development and preparation of this institute was Gary Fedder, Carnegie Mellon’s vice provost for research as well as the Howard M. Wilkoff Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and a professor at Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute. He played a pivotal role in the establishment of the institute.
“When the DoD announced its intention to create a new institute dedicated to robotics manufacturing, we knew that [Carnegie Mellon]’s historic strength in the field, leading to cutting-edge research underway today, gave us a great opportunity,” said Fedder in a press release. “We were fortunate to build a team that brought complementary strengths from across the nation.”
One of Fedder’s partners on the project was Howie Choset, also a professor in the Robotics Institute. “This work has the power to benefit society broadly, and to benefit many, many potential workers and their families,” said Choset. Their mission, as Howie explained, has four prongs: empower American workers to compete with low-wage workers abroad, create and sustain new jobs to secure U.S. national prosperity, lower the technical, operational, and economic barriers for small-medium sized enterprises as well as large companies to adopt robotics technologies, and assert U.S. leadership in advanced manufacturing.
Robots come with many challenges; they are expensive, singularly purposed, challenging to reprogram, and require isolation from humans for our safety. However, the Advanced Robotics Manufacturing Institute (ARM) seeks to help make their robots safer, more affordable, and more useful.
“The institute will tap into Carnegie Mellon’s research strengths in collaborative robotics, sensor technologies, materials science and human-computer interaction, areas that are rapidly transforming many sectors of our economy,” said Provost Farnam Jahanian. “With this unique partnership between academia, government, and industry, [Carnegie Mellon] is poised to bridge the gap between research, innovation, and practice in the emerging field of advanced manufacturing.”

Stephen E. Fienberg, Carnegie Mellon Professor of Statistics and Social Science, passed away on Dec. 14 at the age of 74.
Fienberg was a world-renowned statistician famous for creating certain statistical applications as a way to impact public policy and science. Some of the areas his work targeted were elements of human rights, forensics, survey procedures, census polling, and privacy standards. Additionally, Fienberg was voted into the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in 1999 and developed methodological and theoretical progressions in both multivariate and algebraic statistics. Fienberg also pursued his interests in other academic areas and spearheaded machine learning at Carnegie Mellon.
“It was an incredible fortune to know and work with Steve Fienberg. He was the consummate academic who did it all — from administrative work to teaching and advising all while working to solve many of society’s grand challenges,” Richard Scheines, Dean of the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences said in a university press release. “Steve had preternatural energy, and he made everything he took on better, including the Statistics Department, the National Academy of Sciences, the Machine Learning Department, you name it. He was rightfully regarded by his CMU colleagues and his collaborators around the world as a world-class talent. He will be sorely missed.”
After coming to Carnegie Mellon in 1980 as a member of the Statistics Department, Fienberg was also appointed positions in Heinz College, CyLab, and the Machine Learning Department. Fienberg was appointed head of the Statistics Department from 1981 to 1984 and was a key player in incorporating the Statistics Department with the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. He was known for enlisting world-class professors and held the position of dean of the college from 1987 to 1991. During his time as the Dean of Dietrich College, Fienberg founded the Modern Languages Department, which resulted in improving the college’s standing.
“For 36 years, Steve was one of Carnegie Mellon’s most valued citizens,” Provost Farnam Jahanian said. “A brilliant, nationally renowned statistician and a thought leader on data-sharing, he made a transformative impact on the fields of social and behavioral science and machine learning. As a teacher and leader, he was collaborative, thoughtful and remarkably generous — a truly rare find. Steve has left an indelible mark on the institution and on the countless students, faculty and staff who were fortunate to work alongside him.”
For the National Academy of Sciences, over a course of more than 40 years, Fienberg was on 35 committees and panels that tackled subjects ranging from bilingual education to census data. He also took part in the Standing Committee of the American Opportunity Study, whose goal is to examine data from the U.S. census to investigate individuals’ and families’ trends. Additionally, Fienberg, being an expert in forensics, served on the National Commission of Forensic Science as the only statistician.
Fienberg had many accomplishments and was recognized many times throughout his career. He oversaw 43 Ph.D. students and held numerous honors: the 1982 Committee of Presidents of Statistical Society President’s Award for Outstanding Statistician Under the Age of 40, the 2002 ASA Samuel S. Wilks Award for his distinguished career in statistics, the first Statistical Society of Canada’s Lise Manchester Award in 2008 to recognize excellence in state-of-the-art statistical work on problems of public interest, the 2015 National Institute of Statistical Sciences Jerome Sacks Award for Cross-Disciplinary Research, the 2015 R.A. Fisher Lecture Award from the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies, and the ISBA 2016 Zellner Medal. 
Fienberg also held many fellowships, including fellow positions at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Royal Society of Canada, American Statistical Association (ASA), Institute of Mathematical Statistics and the International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA).
Throughout his career, Fienberg was extremely prolific, publishing over 500 technical papers, editorials, brief papers, and discussions. He also co-authored seven books including 1999’s Who Counts? The Politics of Census-Taking in Contemporary America, which he referred to as “one of his proudest achievements.”
“Steve was a clear role model for how statisticians can make a difference,” Christopher R. Genovese, Head of the Statistics Department said in a university press release. “He had an abiding passion for statistics and its role as a force for good in the world. He was intensely dedicated to his work and focused on doing things the right way. Steve was also incredibly invested in guiding and supporting students, from those in his freshman seminars to the doctoral students he advised. [Carnegie Mellon] Statistics would not be what it is today without him.”

In June 2012, on the 30 year anniversary of a Supreme Court case that banned states from charging undocumented children tuition at public schools, then-President Obama announced his signature immigration program known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.
DACA allows eligible undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as minors — often because they were brought here by their parents — to apply for a renewable two-year deferral of deportation proceedings, to apply for a work permit, and in some states, to receive certain government benefits such as in-state tuition at public colleges or the ability to apply for a driver’s license. However, it does not provide legal status or a path to citizenship — it only allows some undocumented people to come out of the shadows and temporarily live without fear of deportation.
To be eligible for the DACA program, an immigrant must have arrived before the age of 16 and before June 2007, be enrolled in school, have a high school diploma, or be honorably discharged from the military, be younger than 31, and not pose a threat to national security (i.e., no felony or significant misdemeanor convictions and fewer than three misdemeanor convictions).
Republicans during the Obama presidency have tried to defund DACA because they believe it is executive overreach, but in practice this is difficult to do since the application fees form the bulk of DACA funds. Now, with President Trump’s inauguration and Republicans controlling both branches of Congress, the DACA program faces a significant risk of being repealed. Many on the program, known as DREAMers, named after a different immigration program that grants conditional and permanent residency to undocumented immigrants on certain conditions, are worried that under President Trump, they will be deported from the only home many of them have ever known.
In the months since the election, the presidents of over 550 colleges and universities across the U.S. have collectively signed an open letter in support of DACA, including Carnegie Mellon President Subra Suresh.
“Since the advent of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in 2012, we have seen the critical benefits of this program for our students, and the highly positive impacts on our institutions and communities”, the letter declares. It further argues that many DREAMers have actively and positively contributed to both campus communities and wider society, and that they are the “best of America.” “This is both a moral imperative and a national necessity,” the letter states.
While we do not yet know how President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress will change DACA or whether the program would be ended, or what will happen to the DREAMers if the program ends, Carnegie Mellon’s press release states that “[as] an international community of scholars, [Carnegie Mellon] will continue to do all it can to support students, faculty, and staff, including those who are most vulnerable, consistent with local and federal laws.” Meanwhile, Carnegie Mellon’s Division of Student Affairs and Office of General Counsel have conducted meetings with various student groups to hear their questions and concerns about this issue and to take these voices into account while creating university policy.
More details will be published as the current administration unfolds and related university policy is developed.

Long breaks from school have always been marked by weeks of reflection that turn, at least for me, into a need for action. I found myself thinking about Carnegie Mellon (maybe way too much considering that this was supposed to be a time for relaxation) and what changes I would see within the next two and a half years. Having already spent three semesters getting to know some of the most unique and driven people I’ve ever met, I grew anxious to see what this next semester would bring.
For this reason, it was incredible to return to our weekly Wednesday Cabinet meetings to hear about the Mental Health Advocacy Open House that Eric Zhu, Student Government’s mental health representative, is organizing with the Provost’s Task Force. The Open House will take place on Monday, Feb. 20 from 6 to 8 p.m. in Peter/Wright/McKenna. The event is an opportunity for mental health advocacy organizations, such as Active Minds, Emerging Leaders, Counseling and Psychological Services, and University Healthy Services, to present their past work as well as their goals for the upcoming two semesters. This is presented with a poster session and roundtable ideation discussions on provided topics.
The goal of this event is to improve communication and coordinate efforts among those on campus who work within mental health advocacy through information and conversation. Again and again mental health has been pinpointed as one of the most pressing concerns at Carnegie Mellon, one that we can always be working harder on.
In establishing a poster template for all interested organizations, the information exchange will be streamlined to benefit both student leaders in mental health as well as general community members. By learning more about what events have already been done, or are being planned on campus, student leaders can ensure that their efforts in student wellness are maximized. For community members, this is an opportunity to find out what aspects of Carnegie Mellon’s mental health action groups interest them the most.
My favorite part of this event is the conversation component. Incredibly impactful actions on campus have all sprung from the right people having the right conversations. With such a diverse, independent, and busy campus, it can be difficult to coordinate connections — by providing a central location for the cross-pollination of ideas, we can ensure that the vision of the Carnegie Mellon of tomorrow is always innovative and empathetic.
I’m incredibly excited for everything that’s in store for this semester, and I believe that this Open House will set an important tradition that will catalyze action beyond what any of us might see during our time here. If you feel there’s something Carnegie Mellon is missing in its mental health discussions, want to join the action, or are even just interested in learning about what the Provost’s Task Force and other related organizations have accomplished to date, make sure to come by! And of course, for any other concerns or ideas you might have, you can always reach out to any member of Cabinet!

Flu forecasting systems predict flu symptoms will peak in upcoming weeks
A group of computer scientists and statisticians at Carnegie Mellon University have predicted that flu activity may be reaching its peak for the 2016-2017 season. This was deduced from models created by the Stat and Delphi flu forecasting systems developed by the Delphi research group at Carnegie Mellon.
The Stat system creates its predictions by analyzing past flu patterns and current input from the CDC and Prevention’s domestic influenza surveillance system. It predicts that flu activity for Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia will peak the week of Feb. 12, and flu activity nationwide will peak this week and next week.
The Delphi system uses best guesses which are made weekly by a group of people who receive input from the CDC’s surveillance network. It predicts that flu activity for Pennsylvania will peak the week of Jan. 29 and will peak nationally the week of Feb. 5.
Compared to 11 competing flu forecasting systems, both the Stat and Delphi flu forecasting systems proved to predict the most accurate forecasts for the 2015-2016 flu season. 
According to a Carnegie Mellon press release, members of the Delphi research group expressed the hope that they will eventually be able to forecast flu activity the same way that meteorologists make weather forecasts.
Meditation could be the key to dealing with stress during the Superbowl
Those looking forward to next week’s Superbowl are probably all too familiar with the stress that comes along with the event, especially if your favorite team is competing. Carnegie Mellon University scientists may have found the solution. They predict that if utilized during the games, mindfulness meditation can help improve stress management.
“If you get stressed out watching football or think that you might, set aside a little time before the game or during halftime doing brief mindfulness practices,” David Creswell, associate professor of psychology in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, said in a university press release. 
Scientists believe that mindfulness meditation can also help relieve stress in our everyday lives. Creswell found that mindfulness intervention programs are able to reduce loneliness in older adults, slow HIV progression, and even improve healthy aging. This is because mindfulness meditation training enhances brain stress resilience circuits and improves inflammatory health outcomes in high-stress adults.
“These brain changes provide a neurobiological marker for improved executive control and stress resilience, such that mindfulness meditation training improves your brain’s ability to help you manage stress,” Creswell said.

The Academic Policies and Practices (APP) Working Group of the Task Force on the CMU Experience recently proposed new policies regarding overloading on units and course dropping/withdrawal deadlines. The policies, despite being well-intentioned efforts to improve student wellness, would have harmful effects on the student body.
One aspect of the proposal concerns overloading, the practice of taking more units worth of courses than is standard in a semester. Currently, first-year students are not permitted to overload in the fall semester. This is a sensible policy aimed at ensuring that students adjust to Carnegie Mellon life and get a sense of how much work they can handle before overloading.
The Working Group’s proposal would extend this restriction to the spring semester, which would unnecessarily limit students’ flexibility. Many first-year students find it beneficial to overload in the spring semester, and the rationale preventing them from overloading in the fall does not apply to a complete ban on overloading during a student’s second semester at Carnegie Mellon. If this policy is enacted anyway, it would be a generous consolation for the administration to consider allowing students to use AP or IB credit to place out of Interpretation and Argument, the first-year writing course required across the university. At least then, many first-year students who previously would have overloaded in order to take an extra course would still be able to take that course by doing so in place of Interpretation and Argument.
The most troubling aspect of the proposal consists of moving the deadlines for dropping and withdrawing from a course several weeks earlier. The proposal suggests two models of changing deadlines which both aim to get students to leave courses earlier in the semester rather than later, but it is possible that the policy would achieve the opposite of its intended goal. A student might remain in the course for an entire semester rather than leaving after the first midterm either out of concern for getting a “W” for withdrawal on the student’s transcript, or because the withdrawal deadline, currently at the very end of the semester, might have passed and the student would have no choice but to remain in the class.
The proposed policy limits students’ flexibility and paternalistically suggests that students cannot make good decisions about when to leave a course. Ironically, the policy would make it even harder for students to make informed decisions about dropping a course, because they would not be able to spend as much time in the course and will not be able to receive individualized feedback (such as exam results) before the drop deadline.
The proposal suggests that registering for one too many classes and dropping your least-favorite class during the semester should be discouraged. However, this is actually an effective way to maximize the quality of one’s classes,, which in turn rewards professors with happier, more engaged students. Therefore, the administration should be trying to promote policies that empower students to make informed decisions about how they spend their time.
The idea that limiting choices can be beneficial does have some basis in social science, but a kinder and more freedom-preserving approach would be to “nudge” students toward choices that promote wellness rather than forcing restrictive policies on them. One of the proposed changes, making students jump through hoops before overloading by getting approval from their associate dean, follows this idea. The majority of the proposals, however, do not.
There’s another aspect of the proposal that utilizes manipulative behavioral science to attempt to gain support for this policy. By offering two models, one moderately more restrictive than the status quo and the other far more restrictive than the status quo, the Working Group has (either intentionally or accidentally) framed the moderately restrictive proposal as a sensible compromise choice, when in fact both policies would significantly reduce students’ flexibility.
Similarly, in a proposal that takes advantage of the well-documented social science principle that people are influenced by peer pressure, the white paper states that several of our peer institutions have more restrictive policies than Carnegie Mellon. But why should we at Carnegie Mellon adopt inferior policies just because other schools do? Instead, Carnegie Mellon should continue to be a leader when it comes to respecting students’ decision-making abilities.
The current state of affairs does not force any student to overload or to stay in a course they do not like for many weeks. Current policies simply allow students to challenge themselves by overloading or by taking a more difficult class with the knowledge that it is possible to drop it without consequences within a period of ten weeks. Carnegie Mellon ought to trust students to know what is best for themselves rather than impose paternalistic policies that restrict their choices.

Rock music is rebellion. It is a revolt against power, authority, and social norms. For most bands, their battle takes place on the stage, but for the all Asian-American rock group The Slants, their dissonant defiance takes place in the Supreme Court.
These social justice musicians, in a mix of artistic defiance and dry humor, branded themselves with the most hackneyed stereotype in Asian-American culture: slanted eyes. When Simon Tam, a bass guitarist, founded the group in 2006, he was tired of being the “token Asian” in every band. Tam told the Washington Post that when he was putting together the first Asian-American band, he asked his friends what they think all Asians have in common.
“The first thing they said: All Asians have slanted eyes,” Tam said. “I thought, ‘That’s interesting.’ Number one, because it’s not even true. But then I thought, I could call it The Slants. It would be this play on words — because we could talk about our slant on life, what it’s like to be people of color, to be Asian American.”
However, when Tam applied for a patent, which is a necessity for every band, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office rejected their application on the grounds that the term “slants” is disparaging to Asian-Americans. True to the defiant creed of rock, they fought back, and now, after a seven-year legal battle, The Slants are finally appearing before the Supreme Court.
This audacious practice — to take a slur against oneself and make it one’s own — has been in practice long before The Slants made their own ironic, incendiary transformation. It is the center of much intense debate among many artists and racial groups, and many who oppose The Slants do so because they’re afraid that it could lead to the sanction of other, much more hateful speech, such as the n-word. Others, however, support the band’s desire to take ownership of the “language of oppression” and use it “until the words can’t hurt us again,” as they declare in their new EP, The Band Who Must Not Be Named.
However, the Supreme Court judges constitutionality, not by clever invectives or Harry Potter references, and so they are evaluating this case for what it fundamentally is: a freedom of speech issue. What many don’t realize is that the First Amendment protects even “hate speech,” which means that whether the word “slants” is considered offensive or not, it is private, protected speech. This is the full power of words in America — the government cannot restrict speech based on their own agenda or others’ opinions. The Slants have the constitutional right to use their name to comment on race or politics or society, as musicians have been doing since the birth of rock’n’roll. Yet, after the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office rejected their application, it accepted that of another group with the same name. This alternate group didn’t have any Asian members, and so their name wasn’t considered offensive to Asian-Americans. The irony is astounding.
From rappers to football coaches, all inflammatory speakers await the court’s momentous decision, which may expand or contract the limits of free speech in many controversial cases, such as that of the Redskins football team and their painfully banal Native American parody. The Slants are less than thrilled to be associated with other, more offensive groups, as Tam asserts: “Our case is not the floodgate for hate speech in this country.”
While it won’t be a “floodgate,” this ruling will undoubtedly clarify the true freedom of ‘free speech,’ and solidify the constitutional rights of all Americans, Asian or otherwise. The Supreme Court has entertained many eccentric guests in its courtroom, but this Asian-American dance-rock band will be a groundbreaking addition. And, hopefully, their verdict will be one as well.

The day after President Trump took office, women in Washington, D.C. and across the globe marched for women’s rights. President Trump walked in on his first official weekday as President, took in the Oval Office, sat down in his comfy leather chair, and picked up his pen. He surrounded himself with seven other men, and with cameras flashing and reporters shouting questions, he used his pen as a weapon to strike women where it hurts the most — health care. He loudly reinstated the Mexico City Policy, or the “global gag rule,” which is detrimental to women’s health care in developing countries and violates the First Amendment right to the freedom of speech.
The global gag rule prohibits organizations from providing abortion-related information to patients, providing testimony or advocating for the legalization of abortion in countries where it is illegal, providing referrals to other organizations who can perform legal abortions, and providing legal abortions.
The organizations affected by this policy are those who provide family planning services, from contraceptives to maternal checkups and, in countries where it is legal, abortions. These organizations, under the Helm’s Amendment of 1973 are already prohibited from using federal aid to fund abortions.
The global gag rule affects only international non-governmental organizations. It was first introduced in an executive order by President Reagan, undone by President Clinton, reinstated by President W. Bush, repealed by President Obama, and now reinstated by President Trump.
The installation of the global gag rule will have disastrous impacts on the health of women in developing countries.  Most organizations choose not to obey the global gag rule — and lose federal funding — as they see the effects of not being able to provide and discuss abortions far worse than the negative consequences that follow losing federal funding.
Not allowing these organizations to discuss abortions does not provide the proper health care women deserve. At a time when a woman dies from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth every two minutes with 99 percent of these deaths occurring in developing countries, according to statistics from the World Health Organization, access to proper prenatal care has never been more important.
Research from NARAL Pro-Choice America has demonstrated that the global gag rule forces organizations who reject the policy to close clinics and raise fees at the clinics that remain open. These organizations also have far fewer contraceptives at their disposal, increasing the number of unwanted pregnancies. Further research from Population Action International has shown that under the global gag rule, more women lose health care, bear unwanted pregnancies, die, or become disabled due to unsafe abortions. Adolescents are “especially vulnerable to sexual abuse and their pregnancies often result from forced sex, rape or incest” as stated in the Women and Health Learning Package: Unsafe Abortions and Unwanted Pregnancy.
The mass majority of Americans, about about 81 percent, believe abortions should be legal in a few cases, typically in rape, incest, or health of the mother. They should be appalled that their government does not even allow for discussion with clients about abortion in foreign countries where it is legal, or advocacy for the legalization of abortion in countries where it is illegal.
The global gag rule goes farther than just closing clinics and raising costs: It actually violates the First Amendment. The First Amendment states “Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech,” and while executive orders are issued by the President, they are regarding how to enforce laws passed by Congress, therefore binding them to the First Amendment. Not allowing members of these organizations to even advocate for legal abortions abroad is clearly a violation of the First Amendment. According to case precedent in the United States, the global gag rule would be found unconstitutional in court if it applied to organizations that operated within the United States. Censoring information and not allowing members of non-governmental organizations that help with international family planning to advocate for legal abortion in other countries also contradicts American policies that support women's rights and empowerment abroad.
Sean Spicer, the current Press Secretary of the United States, stated in a press conference last Monday, “I think the reinstatement of this [Mexico City] policy...ensures that we’re standing up not just for the life of the unborn, but for also taxpayer funds that are being spent overseas to perform an action that is contrary to the president.” But, as previously stated, the money already wasn’t going to fund abortions. The Constitution clearly states that the role of the presidency is to execute the laws and Supreme Court decisions, even if these are “contrary to the president” and his political agenda.
Women’s health care should be more than a political tennis match. The global gag rule should not be volleyed between presidents in a reinstated and revoked game. Trump’s reinstating of the global gag rule highlights that women’s health care will not remain a priority or even a concern the next four years. The Women’s March on Washington could not have planned for more perfect timing, and the time for women’s health advocates is now.

Of all of Donald Trump’s controversial Cabinet picks, Betsy DeVos, his choice for Secretary of Education, has received a considerable — and much warranted — amount of criticism. DeVos is not an educator, nor does she have experience managing money or even applying for student loans — what she has done is substantial lobbying, mostly on behalf of charter schools. Apart from that targeted interaction with education, she has virtually no qualifications and gives us no reason to expect she will be able to manage the position competently.
Among the few who have reacted positively to DeVos are pro-school-choice groups, simply because of her stance on charter schools — they look forward to having plenty of options when the time comes to choose a school for their children. If her efforts anywhere near resemble what she has already done in Michigan, however, they will sacrifice quality in exchange.
Thanks to DeVos’ efforts, charter schools abound in Detroit — but their test scores continue to rank among the lowest in the state even as their superintendents make as much as $130,000 a year and operators are allowed to expand overseas. According to The New York Times, it is not unheard of for only 10 percent of high school seniors from these schools to score “college ready” on reading tests.
Another downside to DeVos’ championed system is the fact that, when less-than-satisfactory charter schools increase in number and students enrolled, public schools get less funding by the very nature of the relationship between the two. Public schools pay to send children in their districts to charter schools,while still providing transportation themselves. Some charter schools don’t provide free or reduced lunches to children in need. And charter schools, unlike public schools, can refuse students they don’t feel should be a part of their student body.
“The president’s decision to ask Betsy DeVos to run the Department of Education should offend every single American man, woman, and child who has benefitted from the public education system in this country,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said in a statement. “Public education has lifted millions out of poverty, has put millions in good paying jobs, and has been the launching pad for people who went on to cure disease and to create inventions that have changed our society for the better.”
Schumer plans to vote against DeVos at the confirmation hearing.
Another glimpse of DeVos’ inexperience came during her Senate hearing,when she was unable to distinguish between “proficiency” and “growth.” While some schools, which measure proficiency, evaluate their students based on a single benchmark that everyone is expected to reach, others measure growth, or how much children improve their own individual performance. This is an important distinction for the Secretary of Education to understand and develop a position on, as the debate determines which schools could be closed for poor performance..
Of course, DeVos also suggested that guns might be needed in schools to fend off grizzly bears, so perhaps this lack of understanding is simply the tip of the iceberg.
Especially concerning for us at Carnegie Mellon is the fact that, if confirmed, DeVos would be in charge of running a $1 trillion student loan bank, despite having no experience managing anywhere near that amount of money. She has no concrete plans to ensure tax money does not contribute to fraud and abuse, beyond delegating it to others in her department. She further refused to commit to enforcing the rules already in place to oversee colleges receiving federal funds without further review.
In addition, she’s never even had to apply for financial aid for herself or her children, so we can’t expect her to have any understanding of or empathy for the process.
DeVos has also said some worrying statements regarding sexual assault on campus. She refused to commit to upholding the 2011 Title IX, an anti-discrimination law which prohibits sexual assault as a form of sexual harassment on campus. This has left many concerned over the attitude the Department of Education would take regarding sexual assault under DeVos.
Furthermore, though DeVos has since attempted to change her stance, she did waver on whether she would enforce the Individuals with Disabilities Act during the hearing. At one point, she said she felt it should be up to the states to decide — despite being a federal law to ensure that all students’ rights are protected, and that parents have a say in their disabled children’s education.
DeVos was also questioned over donations her family has made to the Republican Party amounting to around $200 million, and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) asked her if she was chosen purely for this reason. And though she has resigned from a dozen foundations, including All Children Matter and Great Lakes Education Foundation, and plans to divest from 102 companies within 90 days of being confirmed, she would remain a co-trustee of three family trusts that could keep her tied to educational organizations like for-profit colleges.
The way DeVos’ hearing was run was equally as concerning as her conception of the realities of schooling in America. During the hearing,each senator had only five minutes to question DeVos, and they were not permitted a second round of questioning, despite precedents in which they had been granted more time .
Senator Lemar Alexander (R-TN) did say that Senators could question DeVos in their offices at another time, but the public could not watch these meetings the way they were able to see the hearing.
Furthermore, DeVos’ completed ethics review was not made available until after the hearing, making it impossible for senators to address content they found within the document publicly.
In an even more worrying move, the White House has yet to reconnect the phone lines, so callers concerned about DeVos are not being heard. A voice mail recommends that callers instead turn to Facebook or email to voice their opinion, but studies have shown that calling is far more effective. While people can still call senators’ and representatives’ offices directly, there’s something about being cut off from the White House itself that somehow suggests a lack of a voice in the matter.
In the end, though a second hearing has not been granted, the vote on DeVos’ hearing was postponed until Jan. 31 to give lawmakers time to question her financial disclosures and positions individually. For the sake of students everywhere, we can only hope that some will change their minds based on what they hear and what their constituents say.

Jan. 21, 2017 is marked in the calendar as the day when the “power” and the “pink rebel” challenged each other. While the power refers to Donald Trump’s Inauguration ceremony as the 45th President of USA, the ‘pink rebel’ points to the Women’s March that was the largest one-day protest in the US history.
I call the Women’s March the “pink rebel” because of the symbolic pink hats that the majority of the people wore that day. The pink hats are aptly called “p**** hats” and were manufactured under the Pussyhat project to denote solidarity and unity among the protesters.
Reports suggest that at least 3.3 million people across the United States took part in the protest. When it comes to Washington, D.C., the source city for the event, the crowd count soared to more than half a million — almost three times greater than the President’s Inaugural ceremony! Well, you just need basic math here to measure the success of the events. If there is one thing that I have observed in these days, it is this: The citizens of the country are at unrest. Women, workers, immigrants, LGBTQ, and environmentalists — everyone who makes our society diverse and unified at the same time — now feel insecure about their rights.
Many people did lose faith after the United States’ election results, and the Women’s March was their beacon of hope. The pink rebel brought together people from across the world to unite for a cause — to stand and fight for your rights! And by “your” I don’t just mean women, but anyone who felt deprived and forbidden of what is theirs. So that day when millions of women protested, a little fire ignited in me, too. I thought, “How often do we see a march led by a community that stands not just for itself but for all? That is so rare!” I could see the immense strength that the pink rebel bore to stand against the current government and to voice its opinion. But as I started building my castles of bright future, I came across various articles and news that showed women of color were annoyed at the event.
They alleged white women to be fighting for their own cause and also reminding the masses that white women voted for Trump! According to Vox, 53 percent of white women voted for Trump and according to CNN only 7 percent of black women and 25 percent of Latino women voted for him.
And I was back to square one again. My little flame of hope started to flicker and I sighed in despair. I could easily see a tension emerging. I pondered, “How does the skin color or a person’s vote preference defy the fact that we are a community first and an individual later?”
If almost half of the women voted for the President, there is a considerable half that did not. Why blame the community for what half of the white women did? Are we not grown-ups and mature enough to live with the reality of the inauguration? After all, we cannot play the blame game forever!
A woman from North Carolina shared her experience as a protester who carried a sign, White Women Elected Trump. In her article, she quotes the comments of passersby as she walked in the protest. According to the writer, she received high-fives and ‘thank you’s from black women and Latinos and frowns from younger white women. Many of the older white women made angry rejections claiming that they didn’t vote for Trump, they voted for Hillary Clinton. The writer said that the whole idea of the sign was to make people uncomfortable as it also made her uncomfortable. Moreover, she says that it’s time that white women own what the statistics tell and continue their fight for different causes. In her opinion, the mere idea of acceptance sends a strong message to different women communities — a message that white women stand united with black, brown, trans or queer women.
Every successful event has some shortcomings but the Women’s March proved to be powerful even after plenty of criticisms. When millions of rebels join together in a peaceful protest, it does not remain a protest anymore. It becomes a revolution — a change! The rest we can hope is for the government to look after us and our rights. And just so the government does not forget the pink rebels, there is another peaceful protest rising called The First 100 Days of Resistance. Its goal is to show resistance against the government’s destructive agenda in the next 100 days.
The government must be for the people, of the people and by the people. Let us just hope that nobody forgets that!
