Ben Roethlisberger is nothing short of a Pittsburgh icon. He’s won two Super Bowls, made seven Pro Bowls, led the league in passing yards twice, and led the Steelers as QB for the past 18 years. A clear-cut Hall of Famer, Roethlisberger should look back on his NFL career fondly. Nonetheless, the clock is ticking for old Big Ben. He’s played horribly this season and critics across the league are calling for the Steelers to send him to the bench. While many Steelers fans may have an emotional attachment to their #7, those critics aren’t wrong at all. It’s the end of the road for Ben Roethlisberger.
Over these past few years, Roethlisberger has dealt with various injuries. During the 2019 season, he missed 14 games with a season-ending elbow injury; and last year, even though Roethlisberger never missed a game for health reasons, it was clear that a knee problem was hampering him and severely limiting his mobility (and let’s not pretend Big Ben wasn’t already a statue in the pocket anyway). Furthermore, it’s been revealed that Roethlisberger has been playing with a pectoral injury this season. At this point in his career, it has become evident that Big Ben is injury-prone. Roethlisberger’s defenders will claim that he has been able to successfully play through injuries during the past year, but while Roethlisberger has been tough, his play hasn’t been successful while he’s been injured this season.
It’s been a rough few weeks for Big Ben, even when the Steelers win. Week 1’s win over a very good Bills team seems impressive for Roethlisberger at first glance, but it quickly becomes clear that he didn’t exactly carry the team to victory there. He went 18/32 for 188 yards and a TD against Buffalo, tallying a passer rating of 83.9. Not a disastrous game, especially in a win, but that performance is nothing to write home about. In a loss to a subpar Raiders defense in the subsequent week, he put up 295 yards, going 27/40 with a TD, an interception, and a passer rating of 87.0. Again, this isn’t that bad, but this time, a mediocre game led to a loss for the Steelers. In a very competitive AFC North, the Steelers may have to rely on a wild card spot to make the playoffs, so losing that head-to-head tiebreaker with the Raiders could cause problems later in the year. Finally, Roethlisberger truly played horribly against Cincinnati. With a statline of 38/58, 318 yards, a TD, a pair of picks, four sacks, and a passer rating of 70.9, Roethlisberger’s poor play cost his team any shot of winning against a beatable Bengals squad.
To be quite honest, the biggest problem with Big Ben can be encapsulated through one statistic, AY/A or adjusted yards per pass attempt. A high AY/A implies that a quarterback is taking risks and throwing deep, like classic Ben would. A low AY/A means a QB is just checking down and playing it safe. Unsurprisingly, a low AY/A is not conducive to winning. Back in 2005, when the Steelers won the Super Bowl with Roethlsiberger, Ben’s AY/A was 8.7. This season, though, his AY/A has been a dismal 5.6, which means he’s not airing it out as he should. The best example of this comes in Week 3 against the Bengals. It was 4th and 10 in the red zone, late in the 4th quarter. As they were down two scores, the Steelers needed this conversion. The ball was snapped and Big Ben quickly threw behind the line of scrimmage to running back Najee Harris where he was tackled for a loss. Frankly speaking, Roethlisberger has no confidence in his arm whatsoever. That’s clearly why Harris was targeted  19 times against the Bengals. In fact, Harris received the second-most targets in a game for a running back in the last 30 years (second to Alvin Kamara during Week 3 of 2018). This shows that Roethlisberger is just checking the ball down because he doesn’t believe he can make those deep throws. Watching the game, you could see that Roethlisberger played scared. He played not to lose. By playing not to lose, Roethlisberger let down his team on Sunday.
Personally speaking, I believe that when quarterbacks play scared, they are giving up on the game. I get that Pittsburgh doesn’t really have other viable options on the team at the moment. Benching a franchise legend for Dwayne Haskins or Mason Rudolph would be rather pointless, as was the Giants decision to bench Eli Manning for Geno Smith back in 2019. Moreover, the QBs on the market aren’t that great either. Cam Newton seems to be washed-up, Marcus Mariota can’t get off of IR, and the 49ers don’t seem ready to part with Jimmy Garropolo barring a serious overpay. I guess they could try to get Nick Foles? There’s really no good choices here for Pittsburgh. They might as well give Big Ben one last season. It seems like the Steelers have realized that there’s no easy solution here as well. In fact, at a press conference, Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said that he never considered bringing another QB into the game.
In all seriousness, this has to be the last year for Ben Roethlisberger. I get that the Steelers can’t really bench Big Ben this year, but he’s just not playing well anymore. His arm is shot and he checks down to Najee Harris every other play. This offseason, Kevin Colbert and the Steelers front office need to find a long-term QB, whether it’s high in the draft or through a trade (Kirk Cousins, maybe Russell Wilson wants out?). Either way, Ben Roethlisberger should not be starting Week 1 of 2022.
And so, it seems like Ben Roethlisberger is safe for now. But if he keeps playing like the way he did against the Bengals, Dwayne Haskins should be getting warmed up on the sidelines. Ben Roethlisberger had a magical career, no doubt about it, but time is finally running out for old Big Ben.

Shakhtar Donetsk vs. Inter Milan
In an ironic turn of events, both Shakhtar Donetsk and Inter Milan, despite recording 12 and 11 shots respectively, seemed unable to capitalize. Shakhtar had the advantage in terms of possession and Inter earned more corners, but out of their combined four shots on target, none were able to be converted. Shakhtar’s efforts in the 86th and 87th minutes looked very promising, but Andriy Pyatov denied both to keep the home side winless against Inter Milan in European competition.
Result: 0-0 draw Milan
Ajax vs. Beşiktaş
This match went as predicted. Though Beşiktaş gave it their best, they were outmatched by Ajax — the visitors only managed to scrape together four shots, none of them on target, against the hosts’ 22 shots (seven on target). Although the Beşiktaş defense played relatively well, they were unable to stop a fantastic run by Dusan Tadic down the left wing, resulting in a tactical finish by Steven Berghuis breaking the deadlock in the 17th minute. Ajax extended their lead in the 43rd minute when Serdar Saatci let his mark, Sébastien Haller, get in front of him inside the box, resulting in Haller converting a well-placed cross by Berghuis. Beşiktaş managed to prevent the Dutch from scoring in the second half, but were unable to make and take advantage of opportunities for themselves.
Result: Ajax won 2-0
Real Madrid vs. Sheriff
Sheriff, the dark horse in this year’s Champions League, managed to pull off the biggest upset of the week against Real Madrid in a stunning match. Despite Real having the home advantage on top of advantages in terms of resources, individual players, odds, and even statistics, they played carelessly and failed to take advantage of their 30 shots (11 of which were on target) against Sheriff’s four shots (three of which were on target). A long pass by Sebastien Thill to an unmarked Cristiano resulted in a neat cross into Jasur Yakhshiboev, whose clinical finish put the visitors in front in the 25th minute. The home side created chance upon chance, but no one was able to get past Georgios Athanasiadis until Karim Benzema’s penalty in the 65th minute. This became completely futile for Real, however, when Adama Traoré lobbed the ball to a completely unmarked Thill just outside the box, who calmly put it away in the top left corner to give the visitors their second ever win in the Champions League group stage.
Result: Sheriff won 2-1
AC Milan vs. Atlético Madrid
Rafael Leão opened the scoring for the home side with a well-placed shot in the 20th minute, and it seemed like things were going Milan’s way. However, a second yellow card for Franck Kessié in the 29th minute left Milan scrambling with 10 men on the field. Despite Atlético’s 22 shots, the Italian side was able to hold out until Antoine Griezmann finally put one past Mike Maignan in the 84th minute. A late stoppage-time penalty scored by Luis Suárez resulted in all three points going to the visitors.
Result: Atlético Madrid won 2-1
Borussia Dortmund vs. Sporting
Sporting put up a decent effort against Dortmund, but they were expectedly outmatched. The home side were without Erling Haaland, but young forward Donyell Malen stepped in to score in the 37th minute. Although the German side were far from their best, plagued by several injuries and missing key players, they managed to hold onto the lead to take home all three points.
Result: Dortmund won 1-0
PSG vs. Manchester City
In spite of Pep Guardiola’s Man City having over twice the number of shots and shots on target against their opponents, it was PSG who efficiently capitalized on their chances. Idrissa Gueye put a solid effort into the back of the net with just eight minutes on the clock, and despite City’s numerous attempts, no one could get past Gianluigi Donnarumma. Lionel Messi then broke out of his goal drought with a shot in the 74th minute to seal the win for the home side.
Result: PSG won 2-0
Porto vs. Liverpool
Liverpool put on an exceptional performance against Porto. Braces from Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino, plus a 45th minute goal by Sadio Mané, left the home side in shambles. Mehdi Taremi converted for Porto in the 74th minute, but it was too little, too late against a completely dominant Liverpool.
Result: Liverpool won 5-1
Leipzig vs. Club Brugge
Despite starting strong with the 5th minute goal by Christopher Nkunku, Leipzig was mediocre against a similarly mediocre Club Brugge. It was the Belgian side, however, that took control with Hans Vanaken scoring in the 22nd minute to equalize for the visitors and Mats Rifts putting one past Péter Gulácsi in the 41st minute to give Club Brugge the lead. Neither team was able to make progress in the second half, and the visitors left with all three points.
Result: Club Brugge won 2-1
Atalanta vs. Young Boys
Although they took the game with a narrow scoreline, Atalanta played well against Young Boys, putting seven of their 13 shots within the target area and limiting the visitors to only three total shots (one of which was on target). Still, Young Boys did well to keep the Italian side at bay until Matteo Pessina ushered a shot past David von Ballmoos in the 68th minute to give the home side the win.
Result: Atalanta won 1-0
Zenit St. Petersburg vs Malmö
Zenit St. Petersburg had statistically one of the best performances on Matchday 2. Managing a total of 23 shots, nine of which were on target. Of those nine on-target shots, Zenit converted nearly half of them, putting on an admirable performance against a less-than-pristine Malmö. Goals by Claudinho and Daler Kuzyaev in he ninth and 49th minutes made it clear that the home side were going all-in, and Anel Ahmedhodžić’s sending off in the 53rd minute further crippled the visitors. Aleksei Sutormin and Wendel then put an additional two goals past their Swedish opponents to give Zenit the win.
Result: Zenit won 4-0
Wolfsburg vs. Sevilla
Ironically enough, after both of these teams drew against their Matchday 1 opponents, they proceeded to draw in this match against each other on Matchday 2. Neither side played phenomenally, and the game was rather slow, sans the last 10 minutes. Wolfsburg took an early second-half lead with Renato Steffen’s effort in the 48th minute, but a series of Sevilla efforts near the end of the match culminated in a red card for Josuha Guilavogui’s challenge and a coolly converted penalty by Ivan Rakitić to put the visitors level.
Result: 1-1 draw
Bayern Munich vs. Dynamo Kyiv
Bayern Munich were stellar against an outmatched Dynamo Kyiv, solidifying their position at the top of the Group E table. The German side started out strong, finished clean, and Kyiv was unable to keep up. An early Lewandowski penalty gave the German side the lead in the 12th minute, which was soon doubled with another precise effort by Lewandowski in the 27th minute. Second-half goals from Serge Gnabry, Leroy Sané, and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting left the visitors reeling and a dominant Bayern in firm grasp of all three points.
Result: Bayern Munich won 5-0
Salzburg vs. Lille
Both teams played similarly in a relatively less eventful Matchday 2 game. Karim Adeyemi converted two penalties for the home side in the 35th and 53rd minutes, and a 62nd minute goal by Burak Yilmaz was not enough for the visitors to overcome the deficit.
Result: Salzburg won 2-1
Juventus vs. Chelsea
Though Chelsea had the advantage in terms of total shots (16 against Juventus’ six), both teams were limited to just one shot on target, respectively, and it was the Italian side that converted it, with Federico Chiesa scoring the match-deciding goal just after the start of the second half. This was a less-than-ideal night for the visitors, who had the statistical advantage, dominating in terms of possession and recording a 90 percent pass accuracy. However, goalscoring efficiency is what wins matches, and it was Juventus that stepped it up in this respect.
Result: Juventus won 1-0
Benfica vs. Barcelona
While I had predicted that Barcelona would lose this match given their dismal record this season, their performance on Matchday 2 was even more disappointing than expected. Pedri gave the ball away in midfield shortly after the starting whistle to Julian Weigl, who passed it down the left wing to Darwin Núñez. Núñez then made a fantastic run into the box and put the ball into the bottom left of Barcelona’s net to make it 1-0 to Benfica with only three minutes on the clock. In fact, Benfica could have doubled their lead within the first five minutes if not for Ter Stegen. To Barcelona’s credit, there was a clear attempt to fight back, but the forwards seemed unable to get shots off into the target area, and the energy dissipated. Benfica took full control of the match in the second half, with Rafa Silva doubling the home side’s lead in the 69th minute and Núñez completing his brace with a 79th minute penalty. In a truly humiliating night, Barcelona recorded their second 3-0 loss in a row in this year’s Champions League (having lost 3-0 to Bayern on Matchday 1) and fell rock bottom in the Group E table, beneath third-placed Dynamo Kyiv.
Result: Benfica won 3-0
Manchester United vs. Villareal
To Manchester United’s credit, they managed to overcome their slump enough to take home all three points against Villareal. However, to say that this match was firmly in hand would be a big stretch. Both teams looked relatively equal in strength, and the first half was goalless. David de Gea played well in-goal and it wasn’t until Paco Alcácer’s effort in the 53rd minute that Villareal could take the lead. However, Alex Telles’s 60th minute volley put the hosts back on level ground, and Cristiano Ronaldo’s penalty in the fifth minute of stoppage time clawed back the game for United.
Result: Man United won 2-1

Dietrich College gets a new Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics
The establishment of the Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics was announced on Sept. 22. This is funded by a $20 million donation from Charles C. Hoskinson, founder and co-founder of blockchain platforms Cardano and Ethereum, respectively. The center will be led by professor of philosophy Jeremy Avigad and it will work to make interactive theorem prover Lean, developed by Microsoft, more accessible to new users.
Factoring climate change into energy systems
Climate change is causing the number of extreme weather events around the world to increase in frequency. These events have a great impact on whether people are able to receive electricity, and electricity can often determine whether a victim of the disasters produced from climate change are able to survive as a team led by Paulina Jaramillo, Carnegie Mellon professor of engineering and public policy, found. Using an electrical grid modeling framework, they found that not only peaks in demand for electricity during summers and overall demand will rise, but extreme temperatures could also be harmful to electrical equipment.
A push for data analytics to support national technology and supply chains
Lack of data on the manufacturing of medical supplies can hinder the ability of U.S. officials to effectively respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is the thesis of a policy proposal from the National Strategy Technology group at Carnegie Mellon, which aims to create policy proposals on utilizing data to support "critical technology, supply chain, and infrastructure". The group gave a lab tour called "Innovations That Transform" to United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai on Sept. 30, and also hosted a roundtable discussion on how "the university's research and work complement the Biden-Harris Administration’s trade agenda."
COVID-19 forces Alaskan doctors to choose who survives
Alaska’s small and dispersed population once shielded them from the coronavirus, but not anymore. As the Delta variant sweeps through the population, the state’s isolation is now proving a liability. Hospitals with a limited number of beds cannot transport their patients to other hospitals in time and doctors must make a final decision about who gets the last ICU bed.
Amazon Astro makes its debut
Amazon has released a little robot dog onto the market, and it has drawn a variety of public opinion. This two-foot tablet-faced dog, Astro, is a home robot running with personal assistant Alexa, playing music, checking the stove, and doing other house chores. However, some are doubtful that it will succeed, given that other robot dogs in the past have been discontinued after lack of sales. There are also privacy concerns as the robot can recognize faces, memorize home layouts, act as a surveillance camera, and follow you around, though users can set "off boundaries" zones in their house if needed.
Android 12 and Windows 11 releasing soon
This week, two major OS updates will be released, with Android 12 debuting on Oct. 4 and Windows 11 on Oct. 5. Android 12's biggest change is its design. While still being more minimalistic than others, the new Material You user interface is a design overhaul of its older Material Design framework, featuring more animations, bigger and rounder buttons, and custom color palettes. According to Google, it will be "the biggest design change in Android's history." 
Windows 11 is also highly anticipated, featuring a design reboot that is both visually and functionally similar to MacOS, with a more muted color palette and virtual desktops that users can toggle back and forth between. The release will also allow Android apps to run natively on Windows using Amazon's app store, though this feature will be released later than the actual OS.

An American start-up composed of staff from the Pittsburgh and California Bay Area developed an app in October 2018 that could change the way that people with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) manage their symptoms. The app is called "Eachday," a reference to the developers’ hopes that the app becomes an integral part of the users’ daily lives. According to the company’s press report, Eachday plans to provide users with the skills, medical resources, and guidance necessary to self-manage their ADHD on a daily basis. It is intended to complement existing medical treatments for ADHD, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), therapeutic counseling, and pharmaceutical medication.
The app will feature several beneficial tools including a task planner, a daily calendar, a journal for thoughts, short lessons on emotional regulation, and other components targeting areas in one’s life affected by ADHD. These areas include making friends, managing fidgeting, maintaining hygiene, setting goals, and developing good eating habits, all of which contribute to a holistic treatment plan.
However, the main component of ADHD that the developers of Eachday wish to address through their app is executive dysfunction. Executive dysfunction is defined as the range of deficits in executive functioning, which includes (but is not limited to) behaviors localized in the prefrontal cortex. This could range between decision-making, planning, task management, and organization. Founder and Carnegie Mellon alumnus Christian Murphy, along with Eachday’s medical expert Dr. Duke Ruktanonchai, believe that its feature focusing on executive function-related training will contribute to the app’s effectiveness in helping those with ADHD. 
The app plans to offer short lessons about training those characteristics, while also trying to turn daily tasks (e.g. going to class, buying a bus ticket) into seamless behaviors that require less cognitive effort for users. When talking in-depth about the strategy behind the short lessons, Murphy explained that there were two pieces in a specific executive-functioning situation: the "task" piece and the "managing the moment” piece, and that there is a gap that must be filled. The “task” piece refers to the situation triggering emotional responses, while the “managing the moment” piece refers to the methods used to manage the responses themselves. 
“There are a lot of therapy techniques we can talk about. But when you’re in the moment, you can forget,” Dr. Ruktanonchai said. “Having those techniques in the moment, with the phone, is a totally different approach.” 
Many Eachday lessons teach first clearing one’s mind before redirecting focus to a specific strategy. The strategies that Eachday offers its users serve one of two purposes; the strategies can be used as “triage” when users are having emotionally-intense moments, and the strategies can be used to “re-center” users’ minds.
Eachday is highly user-driven, with the app adjusting itself with the users’ self-reporting and activity within the app. This is important to the developers because ADHD, while having a broad definition in the medical world, has nuances that vary from person to person. In fact, foundational research has proven that there are possibly seven different kinds of ADHD, as opposed to the existing view that there are only three: primarily hyperactive, primarily inattentive, and the combined type. Hence, it is important that ADHD treatment be fluid enough to evolve with the user’s individual needs. And Eachday hopes to do just that. There was even talk of including smart features that offer personalized advice and reminders based on what the user desires help with the most.
As of now, Eachday has created an iOS closed-beta model and is yet to create a model for the Android system. The company has been giving away the app to interested consumers for free. However, in 2022, the company plans to launch the app in the App Store and in the Google Play Store. The price is currently $150.00 for a year or $15.99 per month. While this may seem expensive compared to most other productivity and time-management apps, Murphy states that the app can be a cost-effective alternative to in-person therapy, which can cost almost $400 an hour. 
And in an effort to democratize the app and its services, the developers of Eachday would like to include a “buy one, give one” opportunity to help those in disadvantaged communities. With each paid user of Eachday, the developers will be able to donate the app to another user from a lower-income area. 
Eachday may also be covered by certain insurance providers after gaining FDA approval. Christian says, "through Carnegie Mellon’s corporate-startup lab (CSL), we have been in conversation with Optum and United Healthcare leadership to plan efficacy research, and have also been working to take part in Optum's startup studio accelerator program."
Murphy has high hopes for the success of Eachday, saying that the app is the first of its kind to treat ADHD in a holistic manner. “There are many tools for kids, ... [and a] slew of time management apps, and we have a competitor focused on CBT” he acknowledged, but also stated that many of these apps “do not reduce the cognitive burden” that comes with having ADHD. By offering specialized training in executive function, along with making one app that replaces several (planners, calendars, and other productivity apps), Eachday hopes to reduce cognitive burden and empower those with ADHD to understand more about their individual situations. The goal of Eachday is to normalize ADHD and remove feelings of inadequacy, instead replacing those feelings with the courage to seek help and take control.

A few weeks ago, the super hero Shang Chi leapt from the pages of Marvel Comics to the silver screen, much to the excitement of fans worldwide. And while we all applauded Simu Liu for his charming performance, I couldn’t help but feel the role hadn’t quite been done justice. Perhaps Shang Chi should have been played by Jackie Chan? No, he’s far too old, and I kicked myself for picking someone so well-known and obvious. Maybe leading man Russell Wong? A little younger, but only half Chinese. I thought harder. Steven Yeun? Even younger, handsome, and talented, but he’s Korean! I kicked myself twice, once for being so culturally insensitive, and again because the answer was so obvious. Who could capture the Asian American experience better than anyone in Hollywood? The answer was clear: Scarlett Johansson.
Scarlett is devastatingly talented, beautiful, rich, and least importantly, white. Unenlightened pissants would say that last bit makes her “ineligible” to play characters from different backgrounds, but praytell, what color do we use for canvases? Blank sheets of paper? Answer that question, and you have the reason why a white woman is best suited to play an Asian man. Plus, Ms. Johansson has proven to us repeatedly that she can pull it off. We all loved her as sultry super-spy Black Widow, but how many of us got to see her unreleased independent feature "The Black Widow," where she played Martin Luther King Jr.’s late wife Coretta Scott King? Critics called it “irresponsible,” I called it a “dream come true.” Or what about "Her," where Scarlett’s skillful voice is featured as a friendly AI? A great film, to be sure, but what about little-known "Him," where she confines her body to a wheelchair so as to portray Stephen Hawking in his last years? And speaking of robots, let’s address the elephant in the room: "Ghost in the Shell." 
Scarlett Johansson received much backlash for playing the character Motoko Kusanagi in the 2017 remake of the landmark anime film. Viewers were incensed that a Caucasian woman was playing a Japanese character, especially because of the dire under-representation of Asians and Asian Americans in Hollywood. The movie’s director was accused of white-washing a role that should have gone to a more racially appropriate performer, namely, a woman from Japan. But here I would like to remind our readers that Kusanagi, called the Major in the film, is actually 95 percent artificial, with only her brain remaining inside of a largely constructed body. Would you call a Toyota a Japanese citizen if former Prime Minister Abe was sitting in the backseat? Could a Switch be a native of Shibuya if a Tokyo teen spat on it? Surely Theseus would argue that his ship had indeed changed if every plank had been replaced with several million dollars of CGI and was helmed by a really, really hot white lady. 
To say that white-washing is a problem in today’s film industry would be an understatement. Too many roles are gobbled up by ivory actors that should be given to those unlucky enough not to be. And nine times out of ten, I’m all for slapping those pasty wrists away from roles they have no business playing. But Scar Jo is in that very business. A 5’ 3’’ chameleon, we cannot deny her protean abilities. A Marvel native herself, she’d breathe new life into Shang Chi. And while we’re at it, perhaps we should consider the lovable Paul Rudd for the now open role of Black Panther. He’s shown he doesn’t need Pym Particles to fill big shoes.

On Tuesday, Sept. 22, Pittsburgh experienced a meteorological rarity: a tornado warning. Though many thought the threat had passed, merely two days after, on Friday, Sept. 24, another storm hit: Maude Latour, a pop artist, arrived on campus, fresh off of a plane from New York City and ready to shake up the Mall with her first live show since March 2020.
Prior to the show, I had the absolute thrill of sitting down with a sound-checked and full-of-pre-show-anticipation Latour and her cup of Au Bon Pain peppermint tea.
With all the glamour she presents — from her rainbow-and-glitter branding to her Rapunzel-style golden hair and enormous sunglasses — it’s hard to see Latour and imagine anything other than a born star. Once you listen to her music, though, it’s easy to tell that much more lies under the surface. Pieces like “Starsick” and “Walk Backwards” contain universes of philosophies, theories, and life experiences that made me eager to learn more about Latour.
For one thing, just like many of us, Latour is a college student. While entering what may be a pivotal era for her musical career, she is also beginning her senior year studying philosophy at Columbia University. She tells me philosophy has “helped [her] music be true.” She says, “I want what I say to be what I believe in; I want my music to be held to the same standard as ... truth.”
Let me explain why this is not at all a stretch for Latour; I refer to her music regularly as intellectual pop, a unique brand that appeals to the sensibilities of the modern young adult while invoking a deep sense of identity with the artist. There’s predictable drum beats, synth sounds, and lots of talk about breakups, yes, but there’s also musings on god, literature, and fear of death (see “Superfruit” and “Block Your Number”). You can hear a teenage girl, but also a teenage girl at one of the most prestigious colleges in the country; you can hear late night parties but also mid-day lectures on the classical literary definition of lovesickness — “They were like, ‘lovesickness used to be diagnosed as an actual disease, like a physical ailment with like bodily effects you’d be bedridden and diagnosed with’ [and I was like] no frickin’ wonder.”
As I’ve intoned, Latour’s songwriting can be relied upon to be consistently honest and true-to-life. From writing about “the daily mundane parts of life, like walking across campus,” to songs that are truly confessional, her dedication to reality has fostered a fanbase that is closely connected to her work and her life.
“I guess I’ve kind of had a promise to myself,” she says. “When I first started writing songs, it was like diary entries. I’ve always kept a journal. Since I was like, in first grade pretty much, I’ve written down every single thing that’s ever happened to me. And that is like what I come to music for ... being able to take a moment and make it eternal, being able to take a feeling and capture it, freeze something that’s not meant to be frozen. I always had a promise kind of, to only write songs that I need to get through something, and so they’re the space that I can find the words to say something. It’s like, it’s how I can have my last word for anything, and how I can kind of make sure I’m a person, how I kind of make sure I’m alive. The first form any experience takes in me is music.”
Outside of the writing itself, Latour talked to me about how college has shaped her music journey. She’s surrounded herself with a group of collaborators, friends, and supporters who she describes as “so hungry for inspiration.” Whether it’s help with touring, merchandise, photography, or her epic music videos, she says, ”Everyone has a bit of ownership over the project and we’ve watched it grow together. I wouldn’t want it, I wouldn’t enjoy it as much if they weren’t there.”
I imagined myself in her shoes here, with my life as full as hers — friends, writing, school, trying to build a career as a young artist, and I balked at the immensity of it. Having thought and talked for a long time about work-life balance, I asked her what that juggling act looks like for her.
“I’m taking a slightly lighter course load than I normally do, but then I got back and I sat in on some Shakespeare class, and I was promising myself to just take three classes but then I signed up for more classes because they’re so interesting! That’s kind of always been my approach to school, just really like there to absorb or there to be curious and like, learn for the sake of learning.”
There’s a kind of childlikeness to her unadulterated zest for life and learning that peaks my interest. Here, she equivocates:
“There’s like real answers and like fake answers. Like really, it’s crazy, you know, whenever you have something that you’ve always wanted like, it’s so wonderful when you can truly be grateful for something in the moment as it’s happening — although there’s so many stressful things around as I’m sure you feel going to school here. Like, you wanted it so badly. It’s so wonderful when you can remember how grateful you truly are for what’s occurring at the exact moment.”
I’ve been struck in the face with a parcel of truth so absolute and necessary that I feel the need to mentally step back for a moment. Do we all strive and strive and then forget the striving when we arrive where we were meant to be? She has presented to me a version of gratitude that combines maturity and mindfulness into a system for prioritizing what is right and real and important and happy. For her, she explains, that prioritized slot belongs to music:
“I’m finding ways to [remember] that with music ... even though it’s so much, I’m not gonna let school stress me out at all, and if it’s starting to stress me out I will just be fine getting the lower grade. I realized this summer that if I’m not happy doing [music] then I should quit. Like, it just doesn’t matter. So now my only goal being here is to just be happy; like I do not care how big I get … I just would love to be a little bit happy.”
I say what I think here, and what I think is that by that measure she will be as successful as she could ever want, maybe even a little bit happy, maybe even happy enough. Latour has made space for that too, in many ways. Though music is obviously her ultimate dream, she says, “I could see myself being like a teacher later like way later. I can see myself being in school for a while and then giving that back to people as well,” adding, “we’ll see where this long and winding road does go.”
Part of her long and winding road is coming to a close though, and I ask her about her impending graduation — “Oh my god! You’re right,” she says. “I wonder how it’ll all change when I leave school ... there will be no ceiling and no framework for it … I’ll have to ask myself way harder questions.”
To meet Latour now, through music or otherwise, is to see many doors closing and many more opening all at once. Having just signed on with Warner Records and returned from a pandemic hiatus, she spent this past summer in Los Angeles working on a new album that she describes as “slightly Maude 3.0,” though she noted that there is still work to be done before turning over her newest leaf:
“I have a couple shows this fall — they actually all sold out in 30 seconds and it was so shocking to see that happen, like it’s been so long and my last show before COVID sold like 47 tickets, and now they’re all gone in a moment ... I’m reminded that the final form of all of these songs is them being live in the room sung along to … and they need this closure, they need to be sung in the moment in front of people.”
And to watch her do exactly that was nothing short of euphoric. An audience composed of Latour newbies and die-hards alike crowded together on the Mall grass Friday night for what Latour described as “the dream”: “shows packed with people who know every word.” The show was full of firsts and first-since-pandemic moments and out-of-breath, out-of-voice moments and a whole lot of revisiting the mesmerizing melodies that fans clung to when they first listened to Latour’s music. Latour will certainly be seeing more of these kinds of shows as she embarks on her brand new post-COVID musical adventure. In the meantime, she says, “I’m magnetically pulled regardless of whether I like it or not, to find [the] truer and truer and clearer and clearer, deeper, more pressing, and urgent.” I don’t know about you, but I’m incredibly excited to find out what that sounds like.

“The Velvet Underground & Nico” is one of the most influential albums in music ever and has thus been written about to an excessive extent. Some might say that everyone that read Brian Eno’s statement on the album ended up writing their own take on it. I’m not here to fill that space up further, but rather to give a review on “I’ll Be Your Mirror: A Tribute to The Velvet Underground & Nico.”
The first song of the album, “Sunday Morning,” has a very different feel on IBYM. Performed by Michael Stipe (“Just Like a Movie,” “Two Times Intro: On the Road with Patti Smith”), there is a very full and rich sound backing this longer song. However, the original version feels livelier and the instrumentation is more effective. Michael Stipe still performs very well and makes the song feel more modern without losing its peculiarities.
In contrast, “I’m Waiting for the Man” by Matt Berninger is bad. Missing here is the honesty and simplicity of the original, lauded as one of the best songs in the debut album. There is very little change in this cover, and the change that’s there just makes it worse.
“Femme Fatale” is beautiful in both versions. Sharon Van Etten channels Nico into a powerful droning epic at almost double the length of the original. She differentiates her version by slowing it down dramatically, providing a different audio experience.
The cover of “Venus in Furs” reaches the same highs and lows as the other songs on the album. Audio mixing technology has advanced dramatically since 1967, so the mixing of Andrew Bird and Jess Wolfe is pleasant, perhaps to the detriment of the song itself. When they sing “I am tired, I am weary” it sounds as good as it ever has, but is that worth the loss of the melodic, vaguely Arabic instrumentals?
In “Run Run Run,” Kurt Vile delivers a nice extended version of the original song. There is a stronger production, but you can tell that there is a real affection behind the product and that it was made with love.
St. Vincent completely transforms “All Tomorrow’s Parties” to the extent that it does not make much sense to compare it to the original. My best description of it would be spoken word poetry over ominous ambient elevator music, but not in a bad way. This might be the most Velvet Underground of any of these covers, just due to how unique it feels.
Miles of pages have been written on “Heroin,” the most iconic and controversial Velvet Underground song. I don’t feel the need to add to that conversation. On the subject of the cover, although I’m sure Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth has done tons of heroin, I just don’t care. And from the sound of the song, I don’t think he cares very much either.
“There She Goes Again” is just an incredible cover of one of the best songs on the album. The same lyrics are used to a completely different effect, akin to listening to “Jolene” at 33 rpm. I think the average listener would readily choose this cover to the original. 
In preparation for the authorship of this review, I went on a pilgrimage to the Andy Warhol Museum, so as to soak myself in Warhol vibes before going home and staying awake seven more hours. Thanks to that, I now understand why Warhol wanted the original Vinyl of “The Velvet Underground & Nico” to come with an intentional scratch mark. On “I’ll Be Your Mirror,” Warhol wanted the titular line to repeat until the listener got out of their seats and moved the needle. This surely would have scared any substance-abusing listeners wondering why Nico was repeating that line ad-infinitum. That’s what Courtney Barnetts’ take on the song feels like to me.
I fell asleep, and when I woke up to “The Black Angel’s Death Song,” I was freaking out. I love the drums and claps used in this cover, it adds a sense of freneticism and urgency that suits the nonsensical lyrics. It reminds me of Kafka’s “The Trial” with the angry-sounding lyrics that feel pointed at the listener. This cover is almost completely better than the original, and only suffers in that it does not sound cohesive when listening to the rest of the original album due to different singers and instruments.
Smart people with good taste like “European Son” because of its sophistication and its complexity and its legacy. I just find it too long and don’t think it sounds good. Iggy Pop nails the cover though. It sounds like what Lou Reed would have made if he had more advanced methods of making guitars break.
In the end, I find myself feeling that some individual songs off of “I’ll be Your Mirror” are pleasant companions to their original versions, but listening to the full album is honestly a bit of a chore, at least in comparison to what it apes. Almost every song feels as if it has been stretched like putty, slowed down enough to sound like a remix meant for some sort of movie trailer. Covering an album this revered and influential can be a losing game. If you arrogantly choose to make your own interpretation, then it will most likely not be as good. But if you try to play it straight, then it will lack the personality that makes a song like “Heroin” so popular. But of course, none of this is the goal of “I’ll be Your Mirror.” Artists just joined together to make an homage to a work that influenced them. “I’ll be Your Mirror” is less likely meant to be experienced as an album, and more as individual songs that will pop up in your Spotify playlists after you listen to REM or St. Vincent too much. For that purpose, they serve admirably well. Just don’t come in looking for the next “Velvet Underground and Nico.”

Q: Midterm season is kicking my butt! How do I get an edge?
A: Fake a gnarly head injury. So bad you have to get a neck brace. I’d suggest pretending to slip on black ice, but since winter will soon be a thing of the past, you might have to settle for a trip down the stairs. Make sure your teacher sees you. Once you’ve got the brace on you, write all your notes down on the inside so you can check them during the test. Then take the brace off, read the notes, and memorize them. That way you can sneak the knowledge into the exam room in your head, you lazy so-and-so.
Q: Couldn’t help but notice you said “winter will soon be a thing of the past?” How screwed are we?
A: Not at all! In fact, it’s a blessing. Think about it. Longer summers means longer summer breaks. Rising oceans means more beaches. Warmer weather means we can swim any day in November! So grab some sunscreen and enjoy yourself!
Q: I keep sleeping through my alarm. I wanna wake up early, but I don’t know how!
A:  Please phrase that as a question.
Q: You know what I mean!
A: Question, please.
Q: How do I wake up on time?
A: Sorry, what? Nodded off.
Q: I always take forever to finish my assignments, but my friend A.J. just blitzes through them. How can I compete?
A: Anyone whose name is only two letters is likely “2 stoopid” to really know what they’re doing. This “A.J.” sounds like they’re just rushing through their homework to look good. You, you’ve got the right tack. Slow and steady. And on the off chance they actually are smarter than you, just accuse them of witchcraft and wait for divine retribution.
Q: Hi Auntie, I’m a first-year with pretty bad imposter syndrome. Do I really deserve to be at CMU?
A: No. But that’s only because no one “deserves” anything. The clouds don’t “deserve” to hang in the sky. The Earth does not “deserve” to revolve around the Sun. Tabasco sauce does not “deserve” to taste as good as it does. But hang they do. Revolve it does. Tasty it is. Don’t get caught up in earning your right to be here. You’re here. Be here.
Q: You’re so kind to share your wisdom with us! Say, how’d you get so nice?
A: Clean living and writing all these myself. Clearly I don’t get enough validation.

There’s something very moving about childhood and teenage romance. If you watched Studio Ghibli movies, you’d know that Hayao Miyazaki loves to romanticize the minute details of life, from the slightest hand hold to the exchange of names. If you watched “I Want to Eat Your Pancreas,” you would think that the movie would be wildly cannibalistic, right? 
Not necessarily. Long ago, cannibalism was a much more poignant declaration of love in East Asian cultures. The idea behind it was that consuming the flesh of a healthy someone would allow their soul to live inside of you. So, what does this have to do with a teenage romance? 
Enter Yamauchi Sakura, a popular girl with a sweet personality. She’s a token “it” girl, except for the fact that her pancreas is slowly killing her. 
Sakura (meaning cherry blossom) is not actually the main character. While she is the person of focus for our self-declared loner protagonist, she actually does not have as much plot impact as one would think.
So now take Shiga. Shiga what? We don’t actually know, because he doesn’t reveal his name until the end of the film. For the sake of emulating the impact of the reveal, neither will you, the reader, know his full name until the end of this review. 
He is the complete opposite of Sakura. He’s quiet, has no friends, and generally retains an impassive facial expression for the most of the film. He’s also a bit of an idiot, given that most of his issues are self-imposed, and the only reason he is a loner is because he is adamant about that fact being the primary aspect of his personality. Regardless, he’s the “different” guy, and he’s the only one who knows that Sakura is going to die. 
The movie opens up with Shiga meeting Sakura in the hospital, and they become friends because he doesn’t care that she’s going to die. This may seem harsh, but considering Shiga’s character, it does not convey carelessness. Rather, he just does not know her enough to violate her wishes to live normally and not tell anyone else of her imminent death, not even her best friend, Kyoko.
They get to know each other. Knowing that Sakura is going to die is their “meet-cute,” a term for when two potential romantic partners meet for the first time. They hang out after school, and Shiga’s mother mentions while watching the news how awful the outside world must be, allowing for young girls to be stabbed to death by an unknown man. They travel to Fukuoka together on an overnight trip, and they get forced to reconcile with the idea of sex as budding young adults. At night, in their own little world, as they watch fireworks, Shiga looks at Sakura with all the care and adoration of someone experiencing love for the first time. 
When Sakura tells Shiga to meet her for lunch one day, she never shows up, and it is revealed that she was stabbed on her way to meet him. Remember the obscure commentary that Shiga’s mother made about the news? Yeah, that guy. To make matters worse, the one message that Shiga had sent to Sakura before she died was a declaration saying he wanted to eat her pancreas, saying that he both wanted to be more like her, and that he wishes he could save her.
That’s when it hits our protagonist that no matter what he could have done, he never would have been able to save her.
The movie follows Shiga as he tries to navigate the grief of losing the one person who he could call a friend. Eventually, although he doesn’t go to her funeral, he breaks down crying in front of Sakura’s mom, and asks if he’s allowed to grieve now. 
The big reveal? His name is Haruki, which means spring trees. Cherry blossom, spring tree, get it? The generic reveal shows the few pitfalls of the movie. For the sake of a plot twist and a shock, the movie kills Sakura off in an unconventional, barely fleshed out way. They sacrifice a much more predictable (but moving) ending for the sake of making the audience go, “what?” 
The movie’s protagonist, Haruki, is also so painfully self-imposed in his brooding that the audience can barely be bothered to care that he has no friends. But perhaps the growth is meant to be shown in the epilogue. When he visits Sakura’s grave with her best friend, Kyoko, the pair are now friendly with each other. 
In the realm of animated movies, this film is very revered for its moving ending and beautiful animation. The film really is gorgeously put together, and visually, it fits perfectly with the music of choice. By every other account, the movie is worth the watch. But, as said before, the ending does sacrifice plot for shock. Honestly, I personally would have preferred to see Haruki watch Sakura die of her disease, knowing he can’t do anything to ease her pain, but learning to love himself and the world regardless of the darkness he sees in front of him. 
The movie is not for everyone, of course, but it did hold an exceptional visual standard. It is one of many movies that prove that animation is not just a childish rendition of real life. Rather, sometimes it can be more grim, emotional, and moving than just humans on a screen.

As Allegheny County’s COVID-19 numbers finally start to decline, but vaccine efficacy falls with it, what’s next for the university’s mitigation policies?
The pandemic’s fourth wave is finally receding. Here at Carnegie Mellon, the Tartan Testing results have continued to improve, with a positivity rate of less than one in 500. The seven-day average of new cases in Allegheny County is down 13.8 percent from the last week, and Pennsylvania’s cases are stable after a long surge. Nationally, virus cases are entering their third consecutive week of decline. Southern states — who saw the Delta variant explode earlier than those in the north, and where the condition began to improve earlier as well — are now looking at their lowest caseloads since late July, a potential harbinger of things to come. Cautious optimism is developing, and — just as in the spring — the light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter.
With the FDA only recommending booster shots to certain populations, it appears that most Carnegie Mellon students and staff will have to rely on their original shots. Yet at the same time, with campus COVID-19 tallies extremely low, those shots seem to be doing their job. So where does Carnegie Mellon go from here? Is there a risk of going remote, or is there possible light at the end of the tunnel with a relaxation of the mask mandate?
In an interview with The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon Chief of Staff and COVID-19 coordinator Daryl Weinert declined to give thresholds for the school going remote, saying that the university would “continue to use science-driven and evidence-based approaches to guide our mitigation efforts.” Weinert added that administrators will “consider many data points and the overall context of the Pittsburgh region” to guide policy about in-person classes. He also was hesitant to commit to any criteria for ending or continuing the mask mandate. “We continue to actively monitor the overall COVID landscape both regionally and nationally to inform and guide our facial covering protocols. As our community stabilizes following the start of the fall semester, we’ll reassess the continued requirement for facial coverings with the benefit of data and experience on vaccination rates, virus prevalence and the latest public health guidance,” Weinert said.
When asked about the potential for booster shots, Mr. Weinert sounded as though boosters for Carnegie Mellon students were likely to be a part of the mitigation plan. Weinert said that the University was preparing for a potential move by the CDC to approve booster doses for institutions with a high risk of virus transmission, such as universities. Weinert assured that the university was “preparing for campus support and delivery of COVID-19 booster shots as needed and will communicate further details as the medical guidance develops.”

Over the past several months, Carnegie Mellon’s Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion has welcomed three new coordinators for student engagement and support: Esteban Alcala, Marelyn Maces, and Shanai Sloan. They spoke to The Tartan about their journey in diversity, equity, and inclusion work, their lives, and the numerous ways they hope to support the student body.
Esteban Alcala (he/him/his/él)
Alcala, the newest of the three hires, is a Mexican-American immigrant who calls both San Diego, California, and Tijuana, Mexico, home. As coordinator, he works with SPIRIT, the African Graduate Student Association, and the Society for Hispanic Professional Engineers. Alcala also supports the Tartan Scholars program and the Multicultural Greek Council.
His decision to apply for the open position at the center was influenced by numerous factors, including his ongoing journey of pursuing his doctorate in higher education at the University of Pittsburgh, but being able to engage with students was what stood out the most.
“I really missed working and interacting with students,” Alcala shared. “It was the perfect time and a perfect opportunity.”
Alcala emphasized the Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion and its mission values matched his research goals and own personal values. The role, he said, is an opportunity for him to pay forward the support and mentorship he received from his undergraduate institution as a Latino student.
“I had a place like [the center] in my undergrad years,” he said. “It was a place where I could take naps and breaks, it was a space where I could be myself and have honest conversations with staff. That impacted me and helped me eventually graduate.”
Alcala has numerous goals in making the Center, and Carnegie Mellon, a better place for all.
“[I want to create] programs or initiatives that will have an impact, raise awareness, and create co-conspirators — not necessarily allies — for marginalized communities.”
For a co-conspirator in the space of JEDI (justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion) work, the conspiring typically involves those with privileged identities taking action to directly support those with less privileged identities in their fight for justice.
“This job, or any JEDI work, is about liberation,” Alcala said. “I look up to the former Senator John Lewis and engaging in ‘good trouble.’ It may sound or look different for different people, especially navigating an institution as a staff member and not a student. But I hope to advocate behind the scenes and use whatever influence I have to help as much as possible.”
Esteban Alcala can be reached at his office in the center, or by email at ealcalaa@andrew.cmu.edu.
Marelyn Maces (she/her/hers/ella)
In this role, Maces advises the Asian Student Association and the Spanish and Latino Student Association. Additionally, she supports Out in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (oSTEM), the Latin Graduate Student Association, and First Together.
As a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient, a Latina, and a first-generation college graduate, Maces emphasizes the importance of her identities and their intersections in her work.
“I like to share my identities because they drive me to push for advocacy and equity amongst students, staff, faculty, and anyone in the institution or outside of it,” Maces said.
Her previous work experience, while still rooted in student life, was in housing. However, her passion for advocacy and social justice led her to join the Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion’s team.
“When the Center reached out, I realized the job aligned perfectly with what I wanted,” Maces shared. “I wanted to be in a space where I was working collaboratively, and the morale of the center and what it stood for was everything I wanted, too.”
Similar to Alcala, Maces is motivated by her experience in her undergraduate years. She noted that having a place like the center to go to destress or create lasting relationships is pivotal to the student experience. In this role, she hopes to replicate her own positive experience.
“I want to create a space that our students, especially our marginalized students at CMU, can call home.” Maces explained. “I want to be able to be that support system for students and let them see that they’re not in this alone.”
In addition to supporting students and organizations on campus, Maces hopes to further educate herself and expand her knowledge on topics related to JEDI work. This, she said, will allow her to better understand students and their experiences.
“I am very big on giving back what was given to me,” said Maces. “I want students to see that our staff are allies because of our actions, not just because we’re saying it.”
Marelyn Maces can be reached at her office in the center, or by email at mmaces@andrew.cmu.edu.
Shanai Sloan (she/her/hers)
Sloan is a Pittsburgh native, born-and-raised. In this role, she advises and supports several Carnegie Mellon organizations: PRISM, the Black Graduate Student Organization (BGSO), the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), and Feminists Engaged in Multicultural Matters and Education (FEMME).
Sloan’s path to working for the center, and in student affairs in general, came from her undergraduate experience. From numerous work-study jobs across campus to being a resident assistant (RA), Sloan grew a passion for working with students.
“I really enjoyed being able to build community, meet new people, and bring together diverse groups of folks in a way that allows people to interact in a positive and uplifting setting,” she shared.
This philosophy of community building with diverse perspectives and lived experiences influences two of Sloan’s biggest goals as a new coordinator for student engagement and support: the accessibility and palatability of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion topics, and authentic storytelling.
“It’s important to ask, what are these big buzz words and what do they mean?” Sloan explained. “I want to help students understand their lived experiences in relation to understanding their minoritized and privileged identities because we all, to a certain extent, have minoritized and privileged identities.”
Applying and eventually accepting the staff position at the center was influenced by multiple changes in Sloan’s life. Her coming back to Pittsburgh was influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and the importance of family, for example. However, the pulling factor of the center and Carnegie Mellon was the openness and transparency of our community.
“It really stood out to me in terms of what [the center] was looking for,” she said. “They were looking for someone to be present among students, for someone to be their authentic selves, and I think what drew me in was the idea of storytelling and understanding different narratives.”
Sloan is looking forward to building relationships within the organizations she advises, but eventually wants to meet as much of the Carnegie community as possible. Her priority, of course, is the student experience.
“I want to support you as an advisor, but I also want to support you as a human being,” Sloan shared. “I’m excited to be able to build community and meet new people. The center is here for everyone.”
Shanai Sloan can be reached at her office in the center, or by email at shanais@andrew.cmu.edu.

On the morning of Wednesday, Sept. 29, the Carnegie Mellon campus community walked past the familiar Fence which carried a new message: “Abortion is not a bad word” on one side and “Hands off reproductive rights” on the other. The painting was a preemptive response to the demonstration by anti-abortion group Created Equal on Wednesday afternoon. The demonstration was part of a campus and urban tour by the group, featuring displays of provocative images, and was conducted at the intersection of Forbes and Morewood Ave. Students were alerted about the demonstration through a post on Tuesday afternoon in the Facebook group Overlooked at Carnegie Mellon. In response to the post, Sam Thompson, a junior in mathematical sciences, left a comment saying that he was organizing a Fence painting with a pro-choice message.
“The Fence is central to CMU, and has always been an important part of student speech,” said Thompson in an interview with The Tartan. According to Thompson, painting the Fence was not organized by any campus organization, but it received support from CIA Buggy (of which Thompson is chair), Apex Buggy, and a capella group CMU Soundbytes. About 30 people showed up to paint at midnight.
In a press release, Created Equal described their demonstrations as “anti-abortion display making the case that abortion is age-discrimination,” and referenced Texas’ new anti-abortion law as one of the reasons they have seen an “increase in protests” at their demonstrations.
In an email interview with The Tartan, Lisa Tetrault, professor of history and gender studies at Carnegie Mellon, explained some of the controversial aspects of the Texas anti-abortion law. She referenced Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court precedent which recognized a constitutional right to abortion. “Roe uses a standard of viability, which means states can ban, if they so choose (they are not required to ban) when the fetus can live outside the womb (with intense medical support), which is currently about 24 weeks. At that point the court recognizes life,” Tetrault said. However, she continued, “The TX [Texas] law bans at heartbeat, which is about six weeks, on the argument that this marks life.” The issue, she said, is that at six weeks, most people either do not know or just learn that they are pregnant. Jumping through the hoops of bureaucracy to get an abortion takes time, so the Texas law effectively prevents the ability to get an abortion in time, according to Tetrault.
The provocative images displayed by Created Equal, supposedly depicting aborted fetuses, were designed to draw reactions from people. Instead of arguing on the sidewalk, Thompson wanted to do something that shares the same message but reaches more students. By painting the Fence, Thompson and fellow painters hoped to “give support to some people in a way that’s positive and constructive” and “show students that there are other people that feel the same way as them.” Photos of the Fence painting were posted on the student-run Instagram page @cmufence and quickly gained support, being shared widely among students.
Thompson and other students also camped out and collected donations near Walking to the Sky at the same time that Created Equal were conducting their demonstration from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. In a few hours, they collected over $300 which they donated to the Western PA Fund for Choice, not counting the direct donations made to the Fund by passersby. In this stage in the fight for reproductive rights, Tetrault says students cannot take anything for granted: “Learn what the legalities are. Teach others. Organize. Resist. Vote.”

Disclaimer: I fully appreciate and respect the dining staff at Carnegie Mellon University. They work extremely hard to provide us with palatable food despite being understaffed and under-appreciated. The following is not an attempt to discredit Carnegie Mellon Dining Services, but to highlight its focus on catering to the American palate as opposed to the many international/first-generation immigrant students on campus.
Coming to Carnegie Mellon from Ghana, I expected my new diet to be chock-full of traditional American cuisine. In other words, I imagined sandwiches, greasy burgers, and mildly flavored or salty food passing off as “extra spicy.” Yet, as I scoured through Carnegie Mellon University dining locations’ menus, I felt a spark of hope ignite within me. That spark was extinguished after I bit into a half-frozen turkey sandwich during orientation week.
In an instant, all my fears had been realized. During my first week on campus, I had eaten my fair share of sandwiches, greasy food, and burgers, as I had predicted. Having grown tired of this, I ventured out of my new comfort zone in search of something more to my taste: Taste of India. With excitement, I inched towards the front of the line with fantasies of the flavorful meals and spicy foods to come. Yet as the rice, curry, and chicken were piled onto my plate, it looked different from the Indian food that I ate with my Indian friends back at home. One spoonful of the curry confirmed my doubts. It was bland and spiceless. The rice was too soft and the chicken was too dry. As I glanced across the table, I locked eyes with my Bengali friend who shared my look of sheer terror. The closest food adjacent to her culture was not nearly as fulfilling as she had hoped. This farce of South Asian cuisine had been watered down to cater to the stereotypical white person alone, as opposed to accurately representing the culture it had originated from.
In other words, the consensus amongst the people of color (POC) within my friend group is that, like Taste of India, an overwhelming majority of Carnegie Mellon’s dining locations have limited themselves to providing meals for the ordinary American and failed to cater to the many international and POC students. Though disheartening, it can only be expected in a primarily white institution, and to hope for more would be futile. Nonetheless, it is worth praising the few dining locations on campus that save us from death by blandness. Firstly, Hunan Express was one of the first places I remember having a fulfilling meal. Apart from the consistently good food, Hunan’s kind staff always make me feel better after a long day. Secondly, The Exchange and Innovation Kitchen offer meals that give the foodie in me a reprieve from the traditional American cuisine I came to meet.
The next obvious course of action would have been to explore dining options off campus. However, unlike our neighbors at the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon flex dollars can only be used in a few places within the city, and they usually consist of pizza places and American-style diners, all of which are native to the United States. This only reinforces the monotony within the Carnegie Mellon dining system in terms of multicultural cuisine. By giving its students access to alternate forms of dining, Carnegie Mellon would not only delight its international population, but they would also help make their students the world citizens they hope to produce.
Most people find it difficult to discover things that Carnegie Mellon fails at. It has world-renowned teaching staff, excellent classes, and produces some of the most successful students in the country, yet its greatest weakness is something as seemingly insignificant as the quality of food. With dishes that are constantly skirting the border of tasteless and salty, it is evident that Carnegie Mellon could benefit from giving students access to a wider variety of international cuisine on and off campus that is made by and for people of color to the level of spice they are accustomed to.

This originally was going to be a piece discussing the famed infrastructure bill that likely will never happen given Joe Manchin,  Kyrsten Sinema, and the Democratic Party’s inability to function properly. I had almost written the entire piece when I decided to delete the whole article in inconsolable rage and go back to the drawing board. I try my best to not be as subjective while writing opinion pieces, but analyzing Joe Manchin’s statement about why he decided to randomly oppose the infrastructure bill felt personally insulting and degrading.
One of my favorite professors in political science here at Carnegie Mellon often repeats the following mantra: “What are the decision processes undertaken that drive actions and institutions?” I think about this mantra a lot, especially when reading about the state of domestic politics. Our institutions were designed to be strong, and in many ways, they still are. Even under the extreme circumstances of the past few years, the bureaucracy of unelected technocrats was able to create some coherent policies to balance out the insanity and inconsistency of the elected officials, even if those policies were not great either.
But how long can this country continue to function if those who we elect to represent us are not doing their jobs? We have one party that fundamentally exists to obstruct and serve the interests of the elite rather than average Americans. On the flip side, the other party fundamentally exists to, well, also serve the interests of the elite rather than average Americans. But these elites pay lip service to the average American, so that at least counts for something.
There is a litany of research that has shown that elites have different policy priorities than the majority of Americans. Our elected officials are in that camp. Despite what they might tell us, their priorities are not motivated by service to the people. They are motivated by monetary gain. As dark money continues to seep into the political system and political spending from the wealthy defines senators like Joe Manchin, it begs the following question: What incentives do our elected officials have to legislate in favor of the people?
So much effort went into hyping up this infrastructure bill for Biden’s “Build Back Better” agenda and into wooing the support of moderates and Republicans. Yet two senators from Biden’s own party are about to kill it. They are more interested in empty rhetoric and their corporate donors than the livelihoods of their constituents. It is reminiscent of when former senator Joe Lieberman decided to flip-flop on healthcare legislation in 2009, and it feels surreal that something similar is happening again in 2021. Even if this bill manages to pass, it does not change the fact that the political elites do not care about us. If anything, it will show that enough Americans were fed up with Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema’s antics that they had to reverse course on their empty rhetoric this one time. But I doubt this will happen.
When I signed myself up to study politics, I still believed in a world that could be changed with enough collective effort despite my deepest cynicism. I do not believe in that now, and that is what drove me to delete the original draft of this piece. As I was writing the final paragraph of the original draft, I lied to myself that the state of affairs will look up eventually. I lied to myself that the Democrats will learn from their mistakes and decide to keep their party in line because they want to win. For them, winning is all about enriching themselves while manipulating the concerns of their voters.
I feel sad when I think about the future. I do not feel any hope. The planet is dying, the cost of living is skyrocketing, and the job market is getting more volatile. Yet our political representatives are more interested in their personal enrichment and performative stunts rather than honoring their duties and obligations to serve the people. What hope are we supposed to have? Should we wait for another disaster before elites that control the system realize that their methods are unsustainable? We have had a major economic meltdown and a pandemic in the last 15 years, but that has not really changed the behavior of the political establishment.
No amount of voting can fix the way the system is constructed. No amount of protesting and calling senators will change the way the political elite vote on policy matters. No amount of donating to the Democratic Party will get them to develop a good strategy because they want your donation and nothing else. Revolution is a pipe dream and would not even work anyway because most revolutions do not. If this sounds like I am giving up, it is because I am. I do not want to lose hope, but I sleep better at night knowing that there is nothing I am able to do.

Returning to a dominantly in-person education model amidst the COVID-19 pandemic is a move fraught with danger for the university community. With students, faculty, and staff once again interacting within confined spaces, measures like testing, contact tracing, and quarantining have to be implemented and enforced to ensure that the risk of transmission from infected individuals is minimized. Add to this the usual difficulties associated with scheduling classes, ensuring operational dining services, and maintaining on-campus facilities,  it becomes clear that the university administration has quite the task cut out for them.
Luckily, it seems that despite the challenges, the university’s internal protocols for handling COVID-19 cases have been successful at preventing an outbreak. Of course, there is always the fear that the semester may suddenly transition to online-only or hybrid modalities with little warning, but the fact that we are still on-campus and quickly headed towards mid-semester is an indication that for the most part, the COVID-19 policies have done their job. A quick glance at the university’s COVID-19 dashboard confirms this: as of Oct. 4, the percentage of students, faculty, and staff that have been fully vaccinated is sitting at 95 percent, and the number of confirmed positive cases remains low across all categories. The Tartan Testing program has also identified very few positive asymptomatic cases, with a positivity rate of 0.16 percent as of the time of this writing.
Yet, as we are constantly reminded, vigilance is key when it comes to COVID-19 prevention, and we cannot grow complacent with the status quo just because things are going well on campus. After all, the university does not exist in a vacuum; rather, we are a part of the greater Pittsburgh community, and visitors are common on campus — be it parents, prospective students, or just passersby. This influx presents a problem, because unlike students, faculty, and staff, the university cannot require vaccinations or testing, and instead must rely on the visitors themselves to attest to their vaccination or testing status.
We are not suggesting that people tend to lie about being vaccinated or testing negative, but given the number of people we interact with in our day-to-day lives, it’s impossible to be sure that every single person we come into contact with is negative. A test is only a snapshot in time, so even a negative test, if not recent enough, does not guarantee that a person is virus-free. Additionally, it has been found that those who are vaccinated can still transmit the virus, though it is at a far lower rate than in those who are unvaccinated.
Large volumes of visitors, therefore, present a risk to the health and well-being of the community, and with Family Weekend coming up, we will see many Carnegie Mellon families on campus. It is ultimately up to the university to enforce strict guidelines to ensure that the safety and security we have all worked so hard to maintain as a community is not compromised by visitors who may not be subject to our same standard of caution. 
Aside from visitors, another area of concern is the lack of accessible information regarding contact tracing efforts. While resources like the COVID-19 dashboard give case counts and positivity rates, the university does not provide the students with any information regarding contact tracing. Basic definitions, such as what qualifies as close contact, are unclear, and this ambiguity is dangerous when dealing with transmissible diseases. Greater transparency on this front would help students better safeguard themselves and to seek help sooner if they suspect they have come in close contact, and this information would be a welcome addition to a resource like the COVID-19 dashboard. Furthermore, clearer guidance on what to do after you have been exposed would help students avoid risky behaviors after exposure that may put others at risk.
Overall, the university has done a good job at keeping COVID-19 contained and controlled on campus, but more can be done to ensure that our campus microcosm remains healthy and functional through the end of this pandemic. While the COVID-19 crisis is gradually winding down thanks to the increasing rates of vaccination, we must not falter in our testing, contact tracing, or quarantining efforts, as a lapse on our part could undo all our hard work from the past few semesters.
