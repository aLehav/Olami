Unfortunately, the NHL playoffs have been purged of actual talent this year like Sid, Geno, Jake on an empty net, Jarry (sometimes), and Mike Sullivan’s tie collection. You see, I would gladly respond to your valid criticism about the team I shit on so much I could make laxative companies jealous, but I can’t hear you over the two Stanley Cups we won while I was in middle school.
On a mildly more serious note, there’s nothing more fun than giving genuine insight into sports shrouded in copious amounts of sarcasm so when I’m inevitably wrong, you won’t be able to tell if I was joking and there’s no better best-of-seven playoff format running from mid-April to June to talk about than the NHL playoffs. For the record, I’m sticking with the Eastern Conference for now because they’re all responsible for the murder of my dear Penguinos. Some of these teams may have gotten swept off the face of the Earth by the time anyone actually reads this but hey, let’s discuss each and every series you won’t watch these coming weeks.
Why did Boston of all cities deserve the hockey team holding all six Infinity Stones? They’ve got the greatest regular season in NHL history and they haven’t even snapped their fingers yet. Call up David Pasternak and company to see why they have the Scoring Stone, and talk to the two besties in net, Linus Ullmark and Jeremy Swayman, to see how they went from serviceable in the preseason to holders of the Goaltending Stone now. The retirement home, housing the actually respectable Patrice Bergeron and shitposter-on-ice Brad Marchand, looks like it’s hit its prime again. They have absurd depth throughout the lineup where all 20 skaters and even the goddamn goalies can score at will. In a league with immense parity, going 65-17 is nuts, but let’s not forget, the last “greatest team in history” got swept in 2018… by Ohio. The Panthers only got in because the Penguins simply chose not to be a blood sacrifice to the Bruins but truth is, nothing’s for certain. They’re a solid enough team who managed to make the Matthew Tkachuk trade look like a stroke of genius as he still had a killer year despite the change of uniform but the rest of the team? I mean hey, they got here. Their fans will pretend they exist until they get bumped faster than you can say Bobrovsky, but with other highlights like Brandon Montour deciding to be a blue line beast in the shadows and Sasha Barkov still being an underrated hands god, there really is a chance.
Statistics be damned. Winning a playoff series by accident is easier than losing five-straight first round game 7s and yet here we are. No team in North American sports has choked more than the Maple Leafs throughout the last decade. Toronto put up a fantastic season that went under the radar due to a Boston-sized shadow. Their goalie woes have sorta been solved with an underrated Ilya Samsonov season and that “40% of our salary cap” trio of Auston Matthews’ receding hairline, Mitch Marner’s baby face, and William Nylander’s luscious locks are the stars of the show, reaching new highs of first line production, but they’re kind of the only show here (other than John Tavares). If the rest of the team pulls itself together, maybe, just maybe, they won’t lose another god damn game seven… they’ll lose in a game 6 for mercy. Now let’s talk about the complete opposite. The Lightning have reached 3 straight Stanley Cup Finals and I think it speaks to the power of playoff experience. This is definitely the weakest squad they’ve had in a while even with Nikita Kucherov’s absurd 113 points and Braydon Point’s sneaky 51 goals. The core pieces from each Cup run are still there in all their glory and they’ve proven they’re playoff performers first, good at hockey second. They have a clutch factor you simply cannot measure in the regular season. Vasilevskiy has only given up two, I repeat two, goals in series-clinching games over the past two seasons, totaling seven games and a save percentage that would make Carnegie Mellon overachievers blush at .990. All I can say for certain is I think the team in blue and white will win, argue with a wall.
Carolina’s a great team that just hasn’t been able to break the ice. They’re not the fastest, and yet they blow by teams unwilling to skate at their level especially with the vastly superior Sebastian Aho on their side (not kidding, there are somehow two Sebastian Ahos on opposing teams here). They aren’t the toughest and yet their defense steamrolls the opposition with one of the year’s best two way blue lines. Their goaltending isn’t the greatest and yet they tend to come up huge on the rare occasions the offense can’t light the lamp. Their postgame “Storm Surge” cellies may be the strangest tradition since Nashville trademarked chucking catfish from the upper bowl, but clearly it’s been giving them energy and Lord knows that’s an essential piece to any Cup run. The Islanders, on the other hand, were the other winners of the “slightly better than the Penguins” sweepstakes. I think they’ve convinced themselves that boring their opponents to death is a tactical advantage. I score more at frat parties than the Islanders score on a sheet of ice… I’ve never been to a frat party. In a game of speed, the Islanders think skating like a senior citizen on the PA Turnpike and honing their “defense” is a true strategy. Sorry, defense? Did you mean Ilya Sorokin? This team lives and dies by its Russian brick wall because without him standing on his head, that slow burn style of play will do nothing against a quality opponent. When that offense has put up just as many goose eggs as their very own league leader in shutouts, maybe there’s a problem.
The Devils are hot as hell, no way around that. They’re one of the youngest teams in the league and it shows. This team has an unbelievable amount of youthful energy and if I had to pick a group that exemplifies the phrase, “high flying,” it’s these guys right here. Jack Hughes is finally looking like the correct number one overall pick, Dawson Mercer is one of the most underrated pure scorers in the league, and even Nico Hischier is destroying his draft bust status. Dougie Hamilton ended up being a fantastic, albeit expensive, addition to the lineup. The problem is they’re like character creation in a video game. They put all their XP points into offense, level 100 Charizard type shit, but against some great teams I think they’ll be wishing they spared some for defense. Now let’s talk about the boys on Broadway. This team desperately needs a cup given their absurd midseason acquisitions. Both Vladimir Tarasenko and Patrick Kane may be out of their primes, but both of them are certified Cup champions with incredible career highs and acquiring not just one, but both of them, shows a level of gutsiness I’m honestly glad some GMs still have in them. Igor Shesterkin may not be the Vezina winner he was last year (we scored seven goals on him twice, by the way), but he’s still a great backstop behind a blossoming defense with Adam Fox and Keandre Miller. This offense is also a monster when they feel like it and I’m sure in the playoffs, they’ll absolutely feel like it. Artemi “Breadman” Panarin makes a shit ton of dough and deserves it all having the most consistently quiet 100-point seasons ever. Chris Kreider is an energetic net-front menace that doesn’t stop scoring and behind this booming first line is a truly solid amount of depth. All in all, with the crazy momentum they got in the last leg of the season, this team might put on a show on hockey’s biggest stage.

What a year for basketball, Lebron broke the scoring record, Donovan Mitchell and Damian Lillard each put up 71 points in a game, KD and Kyrie bailed on Brooklyn, and Sacramento, yes Sacramento, is legitimately good. But when given the option between just admiring some great play and speculating about how award races go, most basketball fans seem to pick the latter option. And I’m no different.
This was probably the closest MVP race since Westbrook vs. Harden back in 2017. There are three great options for this award and it’s difficult for me to fault anyone for picking any of them. Nikola Jokić is having his best statistical year yet while leading Denver to the 1 seed in the West. Joel Embiid led the league in scoring while playing great defense. And Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks to the best record in the league, averaging 31/12/6 along the way.
Before I give my vote, I know Giannis is the best player in the league. He strikes fear in opposing players in a way that Embiid and Jokić don’t. But he’s not the MVP this year. His team is stacked, he had a rough (for Giannis’s standards) start to the season, and he missed a decent amount of games too.
And Nikola Jokić is the best offensive player in basketball. His passing is incredible, his scoring so efficient, and he lifts up a team that is pretty bad without him. But Jokić’s defense is a weakness, and his lack of aggression costs his team games. I’m not voting for him either.
Joel Embiid has averaged 33/10/4 this season, and led a 76ers team that is not strong around him (plus Harden missed 24 games this year). His game against Boston solidified it for me. While his teammates floundered, Joel Embiid could not be stopped, controlling the game on each end. His defense edges out Jokić and the load he has to carry is much greater than Giannis. Finally, it’s time for Joel Embiid to win his long-awaited MVP.
Closing out the ballot, Jayson Tatum (still incredibly overrated) was good enough at the beginning of the season to take the 4 spot, and Donovan Mitchell beats out SGA, Luka, Fox, and Sabonis for that 5th spot on the ballot.
Mike Brown has taken the Sacramento Kings to the playoffs for the first time since 2006, ending the longest playoff drought in professional sports. He is an easy choice for this award. Mark Daigneault takes second for a great job with a young Thunder team. Will Hardy gets third place for overachieving with the assumed to be tanking Utah Jazz.
Paolo Banchero has lived up to lofty expectations for the Orlando Magic this year, giving them hope for the first time since the Dwight Howard days. Jalen Williams has played a pivotal role on the play-in Thunder, putting him at a clear second place. Finally, Walker Kessler beats out Jabari Smith Jr for the third spot, adding insult to injury for Tim Connelly and the Timberwolves for that horrible Rudy Gobert trade.
This race has tightened up as the year comes to a close, but Jaren Jackson Jr. is still the clear choice. He led the league in blocks and passed the eye-test with flying colors. Players wouldn’t even look at the paint when JJJ was patrolling down low. His fouling is a real issue though, which makes this race close. Brook Lopez was a revelation this year on defense, leading the league in pressures on a great Bucks team. But playing with Giannis and Jrue Holiday takes pressure off of him. 
Evan Mobley has led the league’s best defense this year, and can guard 1-5 without a hitch. But Jarrett Allen deserves more credit than he gets for that defense, and he just isn’t as good as JJJ or Lopez down low for now (Mobley will win a DPOY in the next five years). Jrue Holiday has been incredible at guard defense and deserves credit for being the best in the league when it comes to shutting down the 1 and the 2. 
JJJ gets my pick, even due to the fouling concerns, as he has clearly been the best defender this year when on the court. Lopez takes second for outstanding defense in the post, and his teammate Holiday gets third for fantastic defense against guards. I’m disappointed to be leaving Evan Mobley off but Jrue deserves a spot here.
This is a two-man race between Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Lauri Markkanen. Lauri Markkanen went from a disappointing lottery pick bouncing around the league to the engine that drove Utah’s overachieving season. SGA averaged 31/5/5 this season on strong efficiency and good defense (for a guard). He’s probably going to make the All-NBA first team and end up on plenty of MVP ballots this year. And this is coming from a player who had never made an all-star game before.
Furthermore, SGA led his team to the play-in while Lauri’s Jazz fell short (due to some late-season tanking). Both choices here are valid but I’ve always liked to reward players who jump to superstardom with MIP. That’s why Ja Morant was the right choice last year (sorry Jordan Poole), and it’s why I’m voting SGA this year. While Lauri’s improvement was very impressive, the fact that the Thunder made the play-in breaks the tie in favor of SGA. Nic Claxton, Mikal Bridges, and Jalen Brunson also saw big jumps and deserve credit too.
While there are a lot of good candidates for this award, Malcolm Brogdon and Immanuel Quickley have separated themselves from the pack. Brogdon’s efficiency has helped Boston stay afloat in a tough Eastern conference while Quickley’s scoring has been invaluable for the Knicks while Jalen Brunson and Julius Randle have faced injury concerns. This is probably the tightest award race this year, but Quickley has to carry a larger load than Brogdon, which moves the arrow slightly towards Quickley. Malik Monk and Bobby Portis have also had great years off the bench, and deserve a shout-out!

In 2016, Donald J. Trump was elected U.S. president and gave about the worst victory speech in recent memory. This came as a surprise to, well, pretty much everyone — to his wife, who had allegedly been waiting until he lost to divorce him; to the American people, who had by a margin of a couple million votes preferred his opponent; and most of all, to himself. Allegedly, such was the certainty of defeat that he didn’t even have a victory speech written.
Surely, he should have. FiveThirtyEight predicted going into Election Night that Trump had a 29 percent chance of pulling off the upset. Loads of things are less likely than that. For instance, in that infinitesimally brief moment between when you wake up tomorrow and remember the context of your life, there is about a 14 percent chance that it’s Saturday. It won’t be, of course, but that’s still a decent chance. There’s about a 10 percent chance that on Tuesday, May 3, at 2 p.m., the entirety of the student body will throw our pencils at the whiteboard and walk out of our final exams. (If you’d like to increase that chance, and you absolutely should, contact Cole Skuse at caskuse@andrew.cmu.edu; he’s organizing it.) There’s about a four percent chance that you can play Russian Roulette eighteen times and keep your brains intact, but you sure wouldn’t sell off all your possessions beforehand.
And then there’s the two percent chance that FiveThirtyEight gave to the Pirates winning all six of their games this week, clocking twelve straight quality starts, climbing to half a game back of the Brewers in the NL Central, and being closer to the best record in baseball than they are to not making the playoffs. I’m gonna be honest. I wanted to be prepared and I wrote an article in advance for every other possible outcome, but not for this one. What were the odds? Losing all six would be a very Pirates thing to do. Three and three, sure. But winning six in a row? That was enough success to send me back to the drawing board at 10 p.m. Saturday evening, stone-cold sober, to rewrite my article through the rose-tinted glasses of a fan of the 15-7 Pittsburgh Pirates.
So what’s going on at PNC Park? Simply put, the pitching has been far, far better than in previous years, and they’re keeping the Pirates in way more games.
Of the five Pirate starters — Mitch Keller, Roansy Contreras, Johan Oviedo, Vince Velasquez, and Rich Hill —these four have been excellent this season. All have posted under a .235 batting-average-against, and the entire rotation has an ERA under 5.00. Even more impressively, Keller (3.64) and Oviedo (2.22) have posted ERAs under four, a historically rare feat for a Pittsburgh pitcher in recent years.
And then there’s the big four relievers — the closer David Bednar, setup man Colin Holderman, and the two Mr. Mop-ups, Wil Crowe and Duane Underwood.
Bednar — well, he’s the best closer in baseball. He has an ERA of 0.90, he has seven saves (for those keeping score at home, that’s on pace for fifty-two), and he’s won two games of his own. Opponents are hitting against him at a measly rate of .179. A deeper look at the Statcast analytics reveals that this might not be a fluke. Bednar relies on three pitches — a four-seam fastball, a changeup, and a curve. His fastball brings the heat, at 96 mph, but his change-up is nearly as hard, maxing out at 95 with an average at 92. His curve is one of the best breaking balls in the game, with a widely varying break and obscene strikeout rate. Also of note is the number of innings he’s been able to throw — he’s one of just seven closers in the game who have thrown ten innings or more this season. If he keeps this up, the Pirates should feel very, very good about ninth-inning leads.
Holderman is rapidly coming into his own, too, with an ERA of 1.80 and ten innings of his own. Last year, he was far from being a fan favorite when he came to Pittsburgh, the consolation prize the Bucs got for giving up Pittsburgh icon Daniel Vogelbach. Yet increasingly, fans are feeling more and more confident when he walks out, as he so often does, in the eighth inning. Crowe and Underwood tend to take the sixth and seventh innings (although Pirate starters have gotten into the seventh inning quite a bit this year), and although they’re utility guys, they’ve put up decent numbers themselves; Crowe allows opponents an average of just .243, while Underwood has posted an ERA of 3.48.
As a result, the pitching — the starters, the bullpen, all of it — has been magical. In the Bucs’ 22 games this season, the pitching has pieced together fifteen wins, allowing more than five runs just six times. On the season, Pittsburgh has allowed just 86 runs while scoring 109, giving the team as a whole an opposing-run average of less than four.
If this continues, and the bats stay hot, we could be in for a fun summer. Next week features a series against the Dodgers at home, the conclusion to a homestand which, if the Pirates beat the Reds on Sunday (which you will know by the time you read this, but I, dear reader, cannot see in my oracle), we will have already won. Then comes a road trip, with six games combined against the Nationals and Rays, before playing the Blue Jays and the Rockies at home. None of these are unwinnable series (with the possible exception of Tampa, but hey, we’re only three games behind them!), and if the Buccos keep up this pace — or anything close to it — it would not be surprising were we to find ourselves at the top of the National League Central by May’s end.
ADDENDUM, Apr. 23, 3:58 p.m.: David Bednar has just shut down the Cincinnati Reds, finishing the Bucs’ second sweep this week. Seven in a row. Seven. In. A. Row. Longest streak in baseball. Vince Velasquez went seven strong, two hits, no runs. Holderman and Bednar closed it out. This is how baseball is meant to be played. This is not how Pirates baseball is meant to be played.
ADDENDUM, Apr. 23, 5:35 p.m.: The Milwaukee Brewers, top of the National League, lost to the Boston Red Sox, 12-5. This means that, at 16-7, the Pirates are in first place, both in the Central Division and in the National League, leading the NL for the first time in decades. God bless America.

Hot dog, it’s sports season and that means it's the perfect time to blow all my savings on GAMBLING. I might be selling my soul to be here at Carnegie Mellon, you can bet your ass (at a solid -145) that I’m going to spend every last cent I have free on sports bets. The rush of winning 35 cents on a dollar is unparalleled compared to anything else I’ve ever done. Skydiving? Fuck that noise, give me a five game parlay any day of the week.
In fact, I’m really good at sports gambling. I’ve made so much money, I can buy myself not one, but two bubble teas at Hunan these days. Yeah, I’m pretty much the Jeff Bezos of Carnegie Mellon. In fact, to everyone who reads the Tartan, I’m willing to bet five HUNDRED doll— hold on, I have to take this call.
“Hm?”
“Oh, I’m broke.”
“Okay, well, tell Tony I’ll have his money by the end of the week.”
“Today? You want me to find the money today?”
“What do you mean ‘it’d be a shame if something happened to my kneecaps’?”
“No, please, I’ll have your money, please.”
Sorry about that. In light of circumstances, I am now proud to announce that Foul Play has been sponsored by DraftKings! DraftKings is the only online betting app where the amount of money you put in and the amount of money you get out will be different! You could make money, you could lose money, you could go even, you could lose money, you could get kicked out of the NFL, you could lose mon— hey what.
Yep, you heard it here first. Or second. The NFL suspended five players for gambling on an app the NFL itself pushes people to use. Four players from the Detroit Lions, two indefinitely, and the rest for six months, for gambling on NFL property. Yeah. 
So while you’re reading Foul Play remember not to gamble any money while reading the article. Gamble right after though, that I’ve got no issues with. 
The NFL seems to have remembered that having a league that pretty much runs on profits from gambling is really, really bad. Players having an incentive to win or lose games is genuinely destructive to a sport, and people can track the collapse of boxing in the U.S. The mob put their thumb on the scale of boxing rings to try to launder money, and when it came out, people just stopped watching boxing. 
That’s probably not going to happen to the NFL, considering how well gambling has gone across, but it’s still insane that we’re just sorta okay with people marketing gambling to everyone. Kids everywhere are watching these games, and seeing sports intertwined with sweaty sports guys trying to sell you on losing money.
Rest assured, I’m nothing like that. I only have your best intentions at heart, and that’s why, DraftKings, Foul Play edition is the only version of the app that has a 100 percent money back guarantee. As in, you are 100 percent guaranteed to get your money back when you win. Trust me, it’s the best deal you’ll get this side of East Mississippi. 
See, the NFL wants to have its cake and eat it too. With tanking already a concept across all major North American franchises, losing just isn’t that costly. In fact, without any sort of relegation system, it’s just not a big deal to throw games, something which will make it a lot easier to shave points and throw games to pull off big paydays. I can imagine big favorites throwing games to get an underdog story going, while also collecting a big payout from people who were dumb enough to bet what Vegas predicted.
That’s really scary, and while there are always rumors that sports are rigged, the idea that the NFL, NBA, or MLB might genuinely just turn into their respective sport’s version of WWE is a pretty depressing thought.
At the same time, I just managed to pay enough to keep my kneecaps, so that’s all for tonight folks. Keep calm, carry on, and go gamble
Editors Note: Do not actually go gamble

The abortion pill has been all over the news recently, so I thought I would write a little explainer to clear up any questions or misconceptions that might have come up for interested parties in the past few weeks. 
The pill everyone has been talking about is mifepristone. A little secret is that the “abortion pill” is not just one pill — it’s a coordinated system of two drugs: mifepristone and misoprostol. A patient needs both to have a successful abortion, but only mifepristone can actually end the life of a fetus, which is why legislators are focusing on it right now.
If you’ve read my guide to birth control, you know that pregnancies require one basic hormone: progesterone. So in order to end pregnancies, mifepristone stops the body from recognizing progesterone. Essentially, it sits in the receptors that the body would normally use to see progesterone and blocks it from binding. The body does not have the tools it needs to support a pregnancy and the fetus is lost within a short period of time. 
It should be noted that abortion is not the only use for mifepristone. It’s used in related situations, such as to ease a difficult miscarriage (the unintentional loss of a pregnancy) or to help with uterine fibroids (buildup of tissue in or near the uterus), but also can block the overproduction of the steroid hormone cortisol similarly to how it blocks progesterone. Mifepristone is prescribed to patients with Cushing’s Syndrome and high blood pressure, both of which are caused by high cortisol. It cannot be used in the case of an ectopic pregnancy, which happens when a fertilized egg starts developing into a fetus anywhere other than in the uterus, usually the fallopian tube.
Mifepristone is the first pill given to those seeking a medical abortion, which is the term for using pills to abort a pregnancy. It can be used up to 10 or 11 weeks into the pregnancy, though it gets less effective the longer you wait. The FDA has assigned it a special Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) designation, which means that doctors need to go through a specific training before they can prescribe it.
48 hours after a patient takes mifepristone, they are directed to take misoprostol. Misoprostol is kind and wonderful and doctors love it. The more I read about it, the more I love it. Its original use was to decrease acid production in the stomach. This is really useful for people who regularly take aspirin or other medicines that can damage the stomach and cause ulcers because a less acidic stomach is a good defense against ulcers.
However, if you want to reap the antacid benefits of misoprostol, you’ll need a negative pregnancy test. It just so happens that misoprostol also causes mad cervical dilation — it opens up the base of the uterus, which usually only happens during labor, and can damage a fetus if you’re unaware that you have one in there. Nowadays, though, there are so many instances where the cervix needs to be opened: to induce labor, to release blood from a postpartum hemorrhage, to release a miscarried fetus, and maybe even to insert an IUD. Before gynecologists get up there with one of those scary speculum things, they can use misoprostol to make things a little easier and less painful. In the case of abortions, misoprostol allows your body to release the developing fetus, resulting in heavy bleeding and cramps for a few weeks after it’s taken. 
Some patients seeking abortions choose the mifepristone plus misoprostol route (the medical abortion) because it can be done with little to no time in a clinic and presents no risk for infection. Alternatively, other patients opt for a surgical abortion, or aspiration, which uses a vacuum to physically remove the fetus, takes less time overall — assuming a clinic is nearby — and results in less bleeding. 
You might be asking yourself, “How is the abortion pill, or pills, different from Plan B?” The answer to that is they are different in the same way that the abortion pill is different from the birth control pill. Plan B and other associated “morning-after” pills contain levonorgestrel, the synthetic form of progestin (NOT progesterone), which they use as a hard brake on ovulation. These pills assume that you haven’t actually gotten pregnant yet, but that there are sperm swimming around in there that need to be kept away from any eggs. 
The abortion pill mifepristone knows that you are already pregnant and knows exactly how to stop it. When paired with misoprostol to release the contents of the uterus, mifepristone can be a welcome alternative to surgical abortions.

Close your eyes and picture a Tyrannosaurus rex. What do you see? Probably some version of the infamous "Jurassic Park" monster, or maybe Sue, nonbinary icon and one of the most complete fossil sets in history. Either way, the first thing you see is, of course, the teeth. Nearly every modern depiction of the T. rex features its massive set of razor-sharp teeth on full display. But a recent study raises the question: What if their signature snarl was a work of fiction? New evidence suggests that the iconic beast’s teeth would have been covered by a set of scaly lips.
Until recently, most paleontologists agreed that T. rex’s teeth would protrude from its mouth, due to both the sheer size of the teeth and the species’ evolutionary similarities to crocodiles. Some even believed that T. rex wouldn’t have been able to fully close its mouth due to the size of those teeth. It was previously theorized that, due to certain similarities with the crocodile, their teeth would similarly point outside the mouth when closed. However, new research casts doubt on these claims, and brings to light plenty of evidence to the contrary. 
Science recently published a study on facial reconstruction in theropods. AKA, it looked at the way the facial features may have been constructed in a certain class of dinosaurs. Several species in particular were addressed, including T. rex. The study questioned the belief that dinosaurs had crocodile-like teeth, using evidence from wear and tear patterns in fossils as well as looking at the tooth-to-skull size ratios of several species. 
The researchers found that when compared to the mouths of modern-day reptiles, T. rex’s teeth are actually quite reasonable. In fact, by proportion, modern-day Varanus salvadorii (crocodile monitor lizards) have even larger teeth than the famous carnivore (despite the name, they are not closely related to crocodiles). Varanus komodoensis (komodo dragons) also have relatively large teeth, and like crocodile monitors, they have a set of scaly lips which allows them to fully close their mouths with ease, concealing most of their teeth from view even when the mouth is fully open. 
Additionally, the study observed key differences between crocodile and dinosaur tooth structure. In a crocodile, the teeth are on a slight outward angle from the jaw, causing them to protrude from their closed mouth. In a T. rex, the teeth face straight upward, suggesting that they would fit neatly within the mouth. The second structural difference had to do with tooth enamel. Since a crocodile’s teeth are constantly exposed to the elements, they show clear signs of wear on the outside of the tooth. But when closely examined, the T. rex’s teeth showed no such wear. This led the researchers to theorize that, like the komodo dragon, the T. rex had a set of scaly lips covering its teeth. If you’re having trouble imagining what that may have looked like, picture the middle stages of an Animorph between an iguana and the dragon from Shrek. 
It should be said, at this point, that the reason I’m talking about lizards so much is because they’re most likely the best living reference point for how dinosaurs may have looked, particularly for theropods. Theropods are a group of two-legged dinosaurs that belonged to one of the major dinosaur lineages Saurichia, which means “lizard-hipped.” As the name would suggest, this is because these dinosaurs’ hips are remarkably similar in structure to those of lizards. From this, we can gather that the best modern reference point for much of dinosaur biology would be large lizards. 
Now you may have heard that chickens or ostriches are the direct descendants of T. rexes, which is true — birds and reptiles actually have a common ancestor in certain carnivorous dinosaurs. But birds evolved tens of millions of years after the last dinosaur roamed the earth, and took an evolutionary path that means they’re much less similar physically. There are a few similarities, though, including that theropods all had bird-like hollow bones. On a related note, you may have also heard speculation that T. rexes were covered in feathers. This was most likely not the case, despite what its genetics eventually led to. Despite some T. rex ancestors having feathers themselves, many skin impressions have been analyzed and no trace of feathers have been found. 
The question of T. rex lips leads to other interesting questions, because broadly speaking, we actually have no idea what dinosaurs looked like in real life. Sure, paleontologists know their skeletal structures and have some imprints of skin texture, but things like soft tissue disintegrate completely over time, leaving us largely in the dark about what exactly they looked like while they were alive. Because bodily features like fatty deposits or skin flaps are almost never preserved, this has an undeniable effect on how we model the supposed appearance of dinosaurs we’ve discovered. Without access to the bulk of their soft tissue, we just make educated guesses at how they were proportioned. This leaves us with the skin-and-bones, gaunt-looking dinosaurs we depict today — the artistic process, essentially, is to model the skeleton, add muscles over it, and then shrink-wrap some skin around that. But when we look at the animals around us, almost none of them are actually built like that! Even reptiles carry fatty deposits, especially the larger ones. Basically, the dinosaurs we depict look like the emaciated, abandoned pets from a Humane Society commercial. 
The complete lack of soft tissue remains leads to very conservative depictions of what dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures would have looked like, because paleontologists are understandably hesitant to speculate with such little evidence. In this way, we may have no idea what certain dinosaurs actually looked like. To illustrate this point, paleoartists C. M. Kosemen and John Conway collaborated on a series of drawings imagining what modern-day animals would look like if we drew them the way we draw dinosaurs — based on nothing but the skeleton. The result is… well… slightly haunting, but a great illustration of how wrong we may be about dinosaurs. If we would have thought zebras looked like that, how much could we be missing about dinosaurs? 
But sparing some miraculous scientific advances, the best we can do for now is combine what hard evidence we have with what we know about similar modern-day animals. So throw out that Jurassic Park poster, and instead imagine the biggest komodo dragon the world has ever seen.

We don’t talk enough about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. A collection of microplastics, macroplastics, and regular plastics collected itself in the vortex that flows between the Americas and Eurasia. There are tons and tons and tons and tons of trash that are filling the Pacific, even forming islands here and there. The Garbage Patch was initially discovered in 1997, and was, to most people, an oddity that couldn’t really be dealt with. The Patch is far outside any country’s international waters, and the amount of time, effort, and resources needed to clean it up would cause a new crisis itself.
Now, originally, people just thought of the Patch as plastic soup. Sorry everyone, no giant islands of plastic here. Just plastic soup with little pieces of plastic in it.
Unfortunately, that reality only lasted a few years, as scientists then found actual, honest to god floating plastic islands, up to 50 feet long — islands, so there were multiple of these suckers. (These aren't actually congealed islands, but rather patches of plastic debris that extend across the water's surface and from the surface down to the ocean floor.)
With a name like Great Pacific Garbage Patch, it’s hard to take it seriously. I, for one, am waiting for the new special, "It’s the Great Garbage, Charlie Brown," to hit theaters before I make any judgments on the Patch, but in reality, this is very dangerous. Microplastics, a scientific word for "small plastics," are very dangerous, the same way small objects are dangerous for toddlers and hyperactive statistics majors (It was one time, okay?), and their grouping in the ocean is devastating to life there. That’s nothing to say of all the plastic that has sunk in the last few decades, since according to studies, 70 percent of plastic waste sinks. That stuff doesn’t degrade, or turn into something natural; it just sits and clogs things. Fish, sea mammals, and anything that lives underwater are at threat from these giant trash islands, and the world’s plastic consumption needs to change in order to deal with it.
That’s serious and all, but did you know they found life on those suckers? Yeah, you heard me, there is organic life on these trash heaps. Not just aquatic organic life too — coastal invertebrate ecosystems have populated almost three quarters of the plastic surveyed, not open ocean species that scientists usually find floating on natural debris. The open ocean species were outcompeted by the coastal ones, and thanks to the permanent nature of those plastics, there was nothing making these islands fall apart. They were stable, slow moving, and the perfect environment to build a new ecosystem. Life really does find a way.
That garbage patch is, however, only going to grow. If we don’t slow down our usage of plastics, there’s going to be more and more garbage for these little lifeforms to grow on. While it's cute for them, it's horrible for the oceans, the fish, and, downstream from that, the humans that live off of fishing. The U.N. is in the process of creating a legally-binding agreement to decrease plastic use, and we should do our best to try to support it.
Until then, try not to watch "Jurassic Park." I’m not sure it isn’t a documentary.

Ask me how my week was. No, seriously. Ask me.
On Monday my Acting for Non-Majors professor mocked me. On Tuesday my Posture professor belittled me. On Wednesday my Colonialism in the Global South professor pantsed me. On Thursday my DiffEq professor called me a dipshit. On Friday I had no classes because I'm in Dietrich. On Saturday my drug dealer sold me mids. And on Sunday I was locked in my godforsaken editing sadness corner for 14 hours.
So ask me how I'm feeling.
Lovingly, 
Your pillbox editors

Whenever my cool, metropolitan friends take me to parties full of strangers, the third question these strangers ask me is always the same (first question: “How old are you?”, second question: “Are you single?”). 
“Sooo, what college do you attend?” 
“Oh, I go to CMU!” I answer, delighted to be able to flex my prestigious alma mater. 
“Huh. Where’s that?”
They never, ever know. There’s the problem, too many CMUs! I say I go to Columbia, nobody asks “Columbia College Chicago?” I say I go to Yale, nobody thinks I’m talking about the college now a part of Coleg Cambria, the college in North East Wales! But I say CMU and, at best, somebody tells me “Oh cool! My uncle found his second wife in Chiangmai, Thailand.” What’s the point of being a student here if it doesn’t get me clout from strangers? There are three reasons to go to a specific college: a world-class education from the finest professors academia has to offer; an awesome student body that consistently helps a homie out; parties with abundant Ketamine. You’ll notice that “Impressing the lowest EQ rock climber at your tech job” is not on the list.
“So whatever, I get it, CMU sucks,” you’ll say, thinking I’m a loser. But that’s self-evident (the bit about CMU sucking), we all know that Carnegie Mellon University sucks. But what of the other CMUs? We may have clinched the .edu domain, the top slot on Google search (ascertained through a double-blind study involving VPNs, burner phones, and a Korean “PC bang” (to reduce interference)), and the wikipedia redirect, but there are still 13 other institutions listed under the higher education section of the CMU (disambiguation) Wikipedia page. Are they real centers for learning? Are they even cool?
Canadian Mennonite University (cmu.ca): Mennonites are not cool, they are Anabaptists. Real ones will know what I’m talking about. If I wanted to go to a tiny cult school in a desolate wasteland, I’d just go to UChicago. From what I can tell, they don’t even have frats. If there’s no ball paddling, I ain’t going. They do, however, accept international students (though I resent being called international), and offer a Bachelor of Music Therapy (the only University in Alberta, Saskatchewan, or Manitoba to do so). And they will consider your application if you have an “acceptable” SAT score. So if you’re not the best of us, and you want less Celsius, go to CMU.
California Miramar University (calmu.edu): This is a for-profit university. There are no good for-profit universities. The concept itself is just completely insane, considering how for-profit normal Universities already are. It’s like with “democratic" countries. When even North Korea calls itself “the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,” you know some really messed up shit is going on when Eritrea just calls itself “the State of Eritrea (ሃገረ ኤርትራ).” Actually, comparing this CMU to Eritrea may be unfair to Eritrea. Very strange circumstances surround California Miramar “University.” Just a quick primer, non-accredited universities are functionally fake. Keep this in mind. This CMU was founded in 2005, in the loosest sense of the term. In fact, 2005 was simply the year that they purchased Pacific Western University’s assets, including its State of California approval status. This basically means that they bought the right to legally call themself a University at a yard sale. Well technically, they only bought Pacific Western University (California). The Hawaiian branch (unaccredited) lasted another year before closing due to a lawsuit filed by the State of Hawaii. This branch was an incredibly fake school that gave out degrees by correspondence. 
Pacific Western University (California) was equally non-legitimate. In one of PWU’s numerous controversies, former Irish Chief Science Advisor (maybe he built potato cannons) Barry McSweeney was forced to resign when journalists uncovered that he obtained his Ph.D. at PWU. The Irish Independent had some choice quotes on the matter: “Los Angeles-based 'university' [...] has no merit or standing in the academic world and has been the subject of numerous official investigations, state bans[,] and media exposés in its 28-year history,” “The Swedish government has listed Pacific Western University (PWU) as a fake institution that issues bogus degrees, while the investigative arm of the US Congress said in a report that PWU was an unaccredited "diploma mill" for CV cheats.” So obviously there was some drama here, the feds were on PWU’s tail, and the CMU swap was intended to start a clean slate. This has not panned out. The university was accredited by the ACICS, but ACICS is no longer recognized by the Department of Education. They still seem to be validly accredited for performing distance education, but we’ll see how long that lasts.
Their current president is a certain Dr. Chitpasong Vazquez, with a Ph.D. in “Leadership” from Alliant Leadership University, another private for-profit university. I’m sure she studied very hard and learned oh so much. In comparison, the old president of PWU was a chiropractic doctor, so this is at least a small step up. When I contacted them for comment, they simply said “You have reached CMU during non-business hours. Our hours of operation are Monday through Friday, 9 o’clock A.M. to 5:30 P.M.” Cleary, they were shaking in their boots at the prospect of being uncovered.
I’d like to thank the 49,976-word long (“The Great Gatsby” is 47,094 words long) California Miramar University Wikipedia talk page (formerly known as the Pacific Western University Wikipedia talk page), with such great section headings as: “Controversy Section Context,” “Controversy section rewrite,” “WHY IS THIS PAGE STILL BLOCKED FROM EDITING AFTER NEARLY EIGHT MONTHS???????????????????????”, and “Consumer Fraud Warning,” for giving me this bounty of information I wish I’d never learned. A full novel’s worth of arguments about the qualities of a silly little university, both sides convinced their ideological opponents are being paid to argue their case. Within the pages of this issue of pillbox, you could be reading the sordid history of the real CMU’s fence. Instead, you are stuck on these pages with me, learning about accreditation fraud. So if our legitness doesn’t please, and you want some fake degrees, go to CMU.
Cambodian Mekong University (mekong.edu.kh): Look, I don’t speak Khmer, and their website looks Google Translated, so I doubt they speak English. Their chancellor's name autocorrects to “Mr. Bean Theory,” and their Alumni page is completely blank. I’m sure a peaceful coexistence is possible between our two realms. Rock on, Phnom Penh bros. So if your life here really sucks, and you crave some fish amoks, go to CMU. 
Chiang Mai University (cmu.ac.th): My Thai is even worse than my Khmer, and my research into this CMU was all the more laborious for it. This CMU appears to be a legitimately competent university, perhaps even a good one. It is allegedly the 134th-best university in the world for studying dentistry and the best Thai university for both psychology and chemistry. (Carnegie Mellon University, in contrast, is not only not the best Thai university for any of these subjects, it isn’t even the best American university, ranking 43rd for chemistry, 23rd for psychology, and around 841st for dentistry.) So if your teeth begin to break, and English you just can’t take, go to CMU.
Cardiff Metropolitan University (cardiffmet.ac.uk): Cardiff Metropolitan University isn’t even a CMU, really. The Welsh call it Prifysgol Metropolitan Caerdydd, and I call it less work for me. So if your list becomes too long, and the acronyms are wrong, go to PMC.
Caribbean Medical University (cmumed.org): This one’s another fake one. Let’s check off the list. For-profit? Check. Sketchy accreditation? Check. Located off an island near Venezuela, but technically under Dutch jurisdiction, but teaching a U.S.-based medical curriculum? Check. They give these very informational webinars on the first Saturday of every month. Students take classes at the World Trade Center Curaçao (not one of the New York ones, those got torn down a few years back) and live in dorms nearby. In one of those dorms, relatively recently (on a geological time scale), a student stabbed another to death. And you thought your roommate was bad! Also, hilariously enough, the CMU website’s accreditation page lists a bunch of flashy organizations like the Government of Curacao or the U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS in an attempt to make you think they’re on the level, but all their babble only tells us that they are legally allowed to call themselves a university and that CMU graduates can practice medicine if they “meet all standard medical licensure criteria and requirements.” The observant among you will notice that this is true for literally everyone. That’s how criteria and requirements work. There is much more about this CMU that I’d love to elaborate on, but the administration is extremely trigger-happy with lawsuits, and I refuse to get dragged to a Caribbean court again. If you want to learn more, I’ll be at La Prima on Tuesday reading a newspaper upside down with holes cut at eye level so I can see through it. So if you want to be a doc, but your head is just a block, go to CMU.
We are now halfway through the list of CMUs. Of course, I’d love to continue on and regale you with stories right now, but the pillbox editors have been on my ass about how my articles are “too good” and “too long,” so we’ll have to take a break here. Pause, stretch your legs, maybe take a little bathroom break. Reread this article twice to cement it in your mind, and prepare yourself for next week. I’ll be waiting.

This Carnival, Scotch'n'Soda put on a production of "9 to 5," an office comedy based on the same-titled 1980 film starring Dolly Parton. After putting on five splendid shows, the highly sophisticated cultural critics of pillbox needed a week or so to simmer on the gravity of this production they had just witnessed. It's just a coincidence that both writers happen to have also been in the show.
The story follows three women struggling to make it through the toil of working at Consolidated Industries under the supervision of their lecherous, power-hungry boss, Frank Hart (Lucas Barnes). Judy (Abby Glass) is a recently divorced woman who finds herself struggling to adapt to the high-stress office life; Violet (Madeline Elston) is a fiercely competent, widowed mother fighting for a promotion; and Doralee (Ashley Offman), our Dolly Parton stand-in, struggles to be taken seriously due to her southern accent and appearance. We also have Roz (Alyssa Rivera), Hart's devoted personal assistant with a hidden passion for her boss that she reveals during "Heart to Hart," the single greatest song in all of musical theater. And last but not least, Trey DuBose gave us "Joe," the rizz-deficient junior accountant who falls for Violet.
And of course, who could ignore the pit. Under the musical direction of Chris Renaud (who developed a bitter feud with pillbox after being unjustly omitted in the fall review of "Something Rotten"), he held together the pit during some of the most challenging numbers ever attempted by humans. And in continuing the tradition of our Musical Director drinking a comical amount of fluid, Chris (known intolerator of lactose) drank one-quarter gallon of chocolate milk during the Thursday show. For my part, I was once again playing Keyboard 2, which generally involved rocking out on a jazz organ or string pads (along with a brief, but glorious moment of accordion during "5 to 9.")
You may have noticed the pit was actually not in a pit, but rather raised to the heavens on a God-insulting, tower-of-babel-esque platform that struck awe (and fear) into the hearts of the pit (minus our drummer Etan, who was Zooming with Chris from behind the platform.) Despite our initial trepidation, the carpenters worked an absolute miracle and created one mighty fine set. Good job carpenters.
Also in the ensemble was 50 percent of our pillbox editing staff, the wonderful and multi-talented Anna Cappella who played the detective in the hospital scene ("What kind of low life would use poison to kill somebody?"). Our very own editor-in-chief Cole Skuse played trombone, and regular pillbox contributor Kate Myers played the role of Frank Hart's wife.
Allegedly, many in the audience could not hear much dialogue. To this end, we suggest they learn to enjoy a vibes-first approach to storytelling, as this musical had no shortage of strong vibes and bangin' tunes.
All in all, it was a fantastic way to sell my soul to Carnival, and I have no qualms about not being able to spend my afternoons drinking in a field with the other denizens of Carnegie State. If you can read a script, play an instrument, or use a drill I highly recommend you keep an eye out for whatever S'n'S has cooking this fall and get involved in some theater.

It is my belief that any musical worth watching has at least one no-man number that features a leading lady singing accompanied by the female-identifying members of the ensemble doing fun shenanigans in the background. I don’t know if there’s a technical name for this type of number, but I know that “9 to 5” has at least three of them.
This is my primary reason for loving “9 to 5.” The writers’ decision to include so many opportunities for women to shine in the show is a great demonstration of what it stands for. Everything about the show is uplifting; whether you’re into big heartwarming numbers or think all men should die, “9 to 5” has something to make you feel like all could be right with the world one day. Depending on which review you decide to read first (pick me! pick me!) you might already have an idea of what the show is about, but I’ll explain anyway. Three women (Judy, Violet, and Doralee) are struggling in their corporate workplace because of sexual harassment, sex-based workplace discrimination, and in one case, their dickish ex-husband. They decide to take advantage of an accident to overthrow their misogynistic CEO Mr. Hart and make their workplace better for everyone. Hart’s secretary Roz (Alyssa Rivera) and the junior accountant Joe (Trey DuBose) provide some rom-com relief as they pursue Mr. Hart and Violet, respectively.
As a performer in Scotch’n’Soda’s carnival production of “9 to 5,” I felt the deep good from the show seep into all corners of my life. I’ll start by saying that I think we put on a great show. By opening night, I felt strongly that everyone around me had the choreography and the lines and the music in our bones, and I think this is because we were all just having so much fun. We were smiling on stage, slaying our way around the wings, mouthing the lines and lyrics that were being sung on stage while we were off. In short, the vibes were really, really good.
Even though I’m a little biased, I think the cast of our show was so talented. The ensemble (including myself and pillbox cartoonist Kate Myers) felt really cohesive in that each member excelled in different areas — acting, singing, or dancing — which helped us all stay strong throughout the show. And the leads simply blew me away. Ashley Offman as Doralee was a stroke of genius. Her accent was so authentic that I often heard Dolly Parton in it when I was caught off guard. I could tell that both she and singer-dancer extraordinaire Madeline Elston (Violet) felt strong personal connections to their characters. This made their performances so much more convincing and really emotional. Abby Glass and her absolutely unbeatable mezzo voice as Judy gave me chills on multiple occasions. I think that the melodies written for Judy are simply more beautiful than any of the other music in the show, and Abby was the perfect person to deliver them to our loving audience.
What really made the show good, though, were the gorgeous creative minds behind the choreography (Remy Goldberg and Jocelyn Selby, who added symbols and motifs galore and made the show look so professional), the set (a God-mocking, two-story, multilayer affair that took 25 hours to load on and off), the direction (dream team Lisset Martinez and Matthew Blankley who absolutely understood the assignment), the hilarious and oh-so kind sound team, the stage and props managers and, of course, the orchestra pit. The last two need extra special mentions: two of our very own Tartan editors (William Curvan, Cole Skuse) braved the heights of the pit platform to give the orchestral performance of a lifetime under the direction of the inimitable Chris Renaud.
Finally, this show would have been a complete and utter mess without the kind, knowledgeable, hardworking stage managers Jesus Feliciano, Quincy Mangi, and Lehan Xu. In wrangling us and helping us carry those pesky desks across the stage a million times, they gave us the power to give you the performance of a lifetime, if you were lucky enough to have been there.

Last week, I revealed to you my two major discoveries about The Fence — the birthday of The Fence (which had been roughly known by people in the know for a while, although now we have the exact date), and definitive photographic proof that our contemporary legend about a bridge over the Cut is completely unevidenced. Now we get to the second major question — when did painting become the modern tradition?
From very early on, it was obvious that painting The Fence didn't emerge as a tradition until at least the '50s or '60s. This comes from two photos, both from one of the first sources I checked — a 2019 YouTube video titled "Isaac Mills Explains the CMU Fence Tradition." In the first, a group of people is painting a very paintless Fence with the words "class of 1966" tagged on one of the railings; in the second, the sisters of AΧΩ are standing on the Fence with the Hunt Library (built in 1960) in the background. Neither of these has any context, so I set out to learn more.
I searched our Digital Archives for the word "fence," setting the filters so I would only get results from The Tartan between 1960 and 1970. The earliest reporting I found about The Fence (not just any old fence, which receives a surprising amount of coverage when you look for them) was an article from September 23, 1964, in which the freshman class is said to have painted The Fence to protest the "Traditions Test" (which, as far as I can tell was a hazing-adjacent ritual the upperclassmen used to subject upon first-years.) The rebellious plebes painted, "Violets are blue, Roses are red, Forget the Traditions Test, Stay in bed." The writers note that the test was held indoors to "prevent freshmen from building a bonfire with the tests. This was done last year." 
Given how nonchalant the authors are in reporting this, I feel certain that it must have been an established tradition to paint The Fence at this point — I find it extremely unlikely that the first ever instance of students painting The Fence would be reported on with such little fanfare. 
But unfortunately, this was the earliest print source I could find. So I had to start speaking with people who were actually there, who would have first-hand recollection of what happened, as it sure seems like nobody was reporting on it at the time (and why would they? If somebody painted The Fence for the first time, everybody would have seen it anyway). I started speaking with people who had worked at the university for a long time and slowly worked my way back to find people who had gone to this school in the 1960s.
However, my chain of sources ended rather quickly. The earliest source I spoke with was Barri Simpson (class of 1968), who told me, much to my surprise, that painting The Fence was solidly a tradition by her freshman year of 1964. According to Simpson, it was almost entirely painted by fraternities and clubs to advertise events and parties — in these hectic days before rules of the Fence were codified, she says that the Fence could even be painted multiple times in a single night. Perhaps because 1964 is a bit before the wave of campus activism and student riots had really swept the country, Simpson claims that "It had nothing to do with activism." 
If anybody wishes to pick up this research in the future (and who knows, maybe that'll be me someday), this is the major point where I didn't find answers. I can tell you for certain that in 1964, it was well-established to paint The Fence to advertise parties. As to who painted it first and why they did, I've got nothing. The next step is to talk to keep working backward and talk to people who went to school in the late 50s.
I want to circle back to the "class of 1966" photo for a moment, because it looks for all the world like the people in the foreground are painting directly onto unpainted wood. Assuming these class of '66 people aren't high schoolers, the earliest this could have been taken was 1962, which doesn't completely jive with Barri Simpson's testimonial that it was a very long-established tradition by 1964. Also, notice that the posts seem to be very thickly layered with paint. Julia Corrin, University Archivist, told me that she believes a rail on The Fence was replaced in 1966. While I couldn't find anything in the Thistle or Tartan to confirm this, it simply works too well as an explanation for this photo. The unpainted railing is the new one, and the class of '66 seniors was given the special privilege of being the first to put a coat of paint on it. So they tagged it with spray paint before going at it with brushes. Mystery solved.
Before I wrap things up, I want to dispel a very common misconception I hear about the Fence. Everybody seems to believe that after collapsing in 1993, it was replaced with a steel-reinforced concrete Fence. Carnegie Mellon's official page on campus traditions repeats this, in addition to repeating the lie that it was the "most painted object in the world" (they also link, as their only citation, the dubious Atlas Obscura article I complained about in part I).
In my research, I spoke with a number of people in facilities management who either worked at Carnegie Mellon in the 90s, or work with people who do. Don Coffelt, the Associate Vice President for Facilities Management, told me in an email that the current railings are made of 4x4 pressure-treated lumber, and the posts are made of concrete; Leonard Libbon, Assistant Director of Facilities Management, agrees with these details. Bob Reppe, the University Architect not only agrees that the railings are wood, but told me that if you reach under the bottom railing closest to CFA you can actually feel the wood. After trying this myself, it baffles me how this completely incorrect piece of information is so ubiquitously known as fact when so many people involved in the replacement are still around. Go ahead and feel it for yourself.
So there you have it. I wish I had a stronger conclusion, but if I let this linger in my Google Drive any longer it would simply never get it done — and the 100th anniversary of The Fence is as good a time as any to share what I've found. I argue that this half-ass, disappointing ending to over 18 months of work is actually completely consistent with The Fence's history. On January 24, 1923, The Tartan reported that "The Senior Fence, at last, after years of discussion, controversy, shifting of responsibility, and disinterestness [sic] of those involved, will be constructed and within a month." So really, my inconsistency and lack of commitment to this project is the perfect way to honor our forebears who built us this beloved campus artifact. 
I hope you've enjoyed reading my column for the last three weeks as much as I've enjoyed working on this (and who knows, I may be back in the future with more findings). Go forth with the knowledge I have armed you with and spread the truth about our Fence because it has too long been the subject of lies and rumors. Thank you for coming with me on this journey.

Ceci,
This week was pretty good. I think I'm figuring out my routine at this point, and the mundanity has started to set in. My playlists have started to stagnate a bit. Actually, on my way back from the gym yesterday, I listened to that Phoebe Bridgers song you recommended to me. She's pretty good, you should send me more of her stuff. 
Did you ever go into the Doherty basements? Arthur and I had a fun time this weekend exploring them. Lots of really weird spots. We got lost for a bit, but Arthur had screenshots of the floorplans, so we took some weird isolated staircase to get to the connection with Wean. It's fun to figure out the ways all these buildings are connected. 
I was hoping Clair would be at course center, but I guess she had done the homework early. I literally feel like I'm back in high school when I say this, but it's hard to figure out how to talk with her. Sometimes it's just super easy to have a conversation with someone, and sometimes I feel like I have to force it. I don't want things to feel forced, but if I avoid talking to her am I ever going to change?
The other usual suspects and I were struggling with the last homework problem, which was based on material from that one lecture nobody understood. Sebastian tried explaining to me what a gradient was, but at a certain point I just had to pretend like I got it so he could go back to his own stuff. I basically had to ask the TA to hold my hand through the entire problem. I feel like I get the content, but I really need to review the lectures on scattering and collisions, otherwise this next midterm is going to kick my ass. Sometimes I'm so intimidated by how smart everybody else is that I wonder if this is the right major for me. Your decision to take a gap year is looking awfully tempting right now. 
We all submitted the homework at different times, but nobody left the room after submitting. Chris got it first, but he stuck around to chat with us and everybody just decided to follow suit. I was the last to finish, meaning there was a point where I was in a room with four other people hanging out while I still had homework to do. It felt good to see the confetti on Canvas though. 
I'm glad they stuck around. I think that was the first time I really got to know those kids. It was one of those conversations where you aren't worried about whether or not you're being funny enough or friendly enough, or if other people like you enough. Our brains were all fried by the homework, and the conversation just flowed really well. I want to get to know them better. 
By the way, I just wanted to address something I maybe haven't been explicit enough about. I don't hold anything against you for not coming back to CMU. Obviously I was disappointed, and I know I complain a lot, but I'm just glad you made the right decisions for yourself. I noticed you hadn't responded to my last two letters, which is fine, but I just thought maybe I was too harsh in them and you felt like I was being ungrateful. Or maybe I'm overthinking it, maybe you're just going through a lot at home. Please write back to let me know.  
Oh, I almost forgot to tell you — when I walked out of Doherty after course center, the sunset made the sky behind Hamerschlag turn the most beautiful shade of orange. You would have loved it.
Best,
Andrew

Theater has power beyond entertainment. It can inspire empathy for humanity. It can share new perspectives for looking at the world. And theater can uncover hidden stories, shedding light on deep-buried narratives. That’s what the new play “How Many Others” aims for, putting the spotlight on Ukrainian women whose accounts have long gone untold. The stories its true-to-life characters share expose the real cost of war on the women it touches.
Developed and produced this year at Carnegie Mellon, “How Many Others” is a delicate yet honest exploration of dark themes and sensitive topics, focusing on the wartime experiences of Ukrainian-Jewish women. The play reveals the underreported toll war takes on women, with the prevalence of sexual violence that lurks beneath the surface of military occupation.
“How Many Others” endeavors to give real life stories coverage through theater, resulting in a deeply impactful production bringing those stories to life with gravity and grace. Covering themes of ultranationalism, antisemitism, and the brutality of war, “How Many Others” begs that question throughout – how many more women will be made victims before the violence ends?
Written by Kristi Good, a professor of dramaturgy in the School of Drama, the play weaves a narrative in documentary style of life in contemporary Ukraine. In developing her work, Good drew on research by two of her dramaturgy students, who had been studying real accounts of Ukrainian-Jewish women alongside the History department.
The stories “How Many Others” is drawn from were collected by Centropa, a European organization dedicated to preserving Jewish memory and histories to preserve and share with the world. Women who’ve lived through consecutive wars have striven to provide diaries for the world to remember their struggles, commenting on post-invasion life.
Recordings from Centropa were poured over by the dramaturgs, who uncovered a dark history of sexual violence during wartime. As Jewish citizens faced the terrors of the Holocaust, many now face parallel traumas as Russia’s war in Ukraine wears on. Assault on captured women was common then and is widespread now, often used as fuel for soldiers’ hypermasculinity as well as a tactic of suppression. From deep dramaturgical research in these issues emerged an urgent need to share war stories with an audience, and “How Many Others” is the product.
“It happened serendipitously,” Good said. Her students shared their research and she knew it had to take the stage for people to understand what’s happening to women in Ukraine right now. Among themes of family and community, the play explores the gendered experiences of Ukrainians during war, revealing stark differences in how war impacts women versus men. It combats attempts at erasing and denying the stories of women, compassionately recognizing war’s many hidden victims.
In hearing the stories one after another, common themes began to emerge. Good ultimately condensed elements from dozens of narratives into four characters — Jewish women of different generations. Each has experienced the same pains of war yet in different ways, some surviving the rape culture of Ukrainian military men, others dealing with the wounds left by abrupt displacement. All have felt the pain of war violence; they all must come together to comfort one another and rebuild. Human kindness and community, continually lost and rebuilt during war, is often all there is to survive its horrors.
Stories like theirs have not gained major attention. As the play expresses, not many people talk about the violence toward women that occurs in war, not many admit that it’s happened repeatedly throughout history. Violence against women is prevalent, used as a tactic for maintaining societal control. Sexual assault on women has long been carried out by the military to keep a country repressed. Russian armies in Ukraine have been doing just that, as German armies did in WWII.
In an extreme nationalist view, women’s role in Ukrainian society is solely to raise children. The female body symbolizes the territory of the motherland, something to remain pure, untouched, and unscathed. When invading forces assault the local women, they are seen as tarnishing the sanctity of the nation itself. Rape during war is not an accident, nor a byproduct. It’s calculated and deliberate — it is a weapon itself.
Good has long been involved with uncovering hidden narratives, a major focus of her work as a dramaturg. Exposing the darkest underbelly of war, illuminating the women caught in its ravages, has been the driving focus through this play’s development process.
“I'm interested in the people who get pushed to the side or silenced because they don't fit into the larger social narrative,” Good said. Learning of the violence war brings to women, she thought, “Wow, that's something that really needs to be talked about.” Her play, a work in progress, is that response.
In today’s world, so much goes unnoticed, so many stories go untold. A medium like theater is perfect for sharing those stories and informing the world about a reality many never see. The best of theatrical productions expands the worldview of their audience. “How Many Others” paces like a drama, but the stories it documents are profoundly real. In the play’s final moments, its leading ladies hold each other arm in arm and breathe a deep breath as one. The hurt has been done, but with each other the healing can begin.

Have you ever looked at a movie poster and said “there’s no way that’s any good”? Well, do I have the article for you. Welcome to Novel-TV, the only article this side of the Mississippi that’ll tell you what Big Hollywood doesn’t want to hear — completely misinformed reviews of movies I haven’t seen and hadn’t even heard of until Sunday at 2 a.m.
The Best Man
The cover on this one has two men with guns on it, so I’m guessing it's set in either Texas or Florida. Given that information, I can only imagine this movie involves intrepid gator hunters, crossing state borders to shoot El Alligatorio, a rabid alligator that ate the lead’s brother in the middle of his wedding. The movie’s climax will consist of the main character fighting El Alligatorio on a moving train being held up by helicopter over the Florida Gulf, and the ending will be the lead getting married to his brother’s widow so it all stays in the family. One deep fried alligator steak out of two.
Alternate Title: Moby Alligator Dick
Carmen
This movie’s title sounds cute, so 50/50 odds it's about serial killers. Based on that assumption, this is a cute romcom about a serial killer dating the detective who’s hunting him. The movie swaps between scenes of brutal Saw-style murder and the serial killer taking the detective out to breakfast at Tiffany’s. The movie ends with the detective accepting that some people just have different ways of interacting with the world. Two liters of blood out of five.
Alternate Title: Stop Killing People? I’m literally neurodivergent AND played by Pedro Pascal lol.
Evil Dead Rising
There are only about 30 different combinations of the words “dead,” “evil,” and “rising,” so we’ve got maybe six more movies before this genre is done, I’m pretty sure. Either way, you know the drill. Curse, graveyard, quicksand if they’re feeling spicy, at least one unnecessary sex scene, and enough bones to teach high school biology. One evil out of zero Deads.
Alternate Title: In another world, but I have to kill people.
Renfield
This movie has Nicholas Cage in it. I cannot speculate on this movie, because no matter what I say, the actual movie will be crazier.
Nicholas Cage decides to steal, get this, my homework, and that’s why I couldn’t submit it today.
The Pope’s Exorcist
The long awaited sequel to "Velocipastor," now the Pastor and the Pope have to team up to keep Tyranna-Satan Rex and his army of Die-ceratops from destroying the world. The Pastor and the Pope explore the meaning of love, devotion, and faith, in a heartrending romantic tragedy that will somehow last for six hours, and feel like twelve. Seventeen Hail Marys out of two.
Alternate Title: The Popemobile Rides Again.
Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant”
Based on the poster, the Ark of the Covenant gets stolen by ISIS, and now well-meaning psychology professor Oklahoma Johnson has to team up with a dog, a cat, and three patients to bring it back to America before it can be used for great evil. Three melting faces out of six.
Alternate Title: Indiana Jones and the Adventures of-- holy shit Harrison Ford is HOW OLD?
Air
The bad ending from The Lorax, feat. Suffocation and Asphyxia.
Dungeons and Dragons, Honor Among Thieves
No dragons, no dungeons, just a bunch of weird groupies staring at me. Mid poster, 1.5 Dungeons out of Dragons.
Alternate Title: CMU RPG association broke into the Drama department
Chevalier
LeBron returns to the Cavs after reading about marxist revolutions in South America and demands the team be rebranded as the “Che-valiers.” He then goes to the finals 31 times, only to lose every time, redistributing the trophy among all the NBA teams. He then joins and successfully overthrows the government of Cleveland and renames it Brontown, Ohio. One Clevelent out of three Detroits.
Alternate Title: Space Jam 3
Beau is Afraid
It's a bunch of white guys on a farm in the South, seems like. I’m sure afraid of that.
Alternate Title: Children of the Cornmeal
Welp, that’s all I got for this week folks. Make sure to go watch some movies and have a blast!

As I'm sure everyone has heard, the Student Dormitory Council recently made an announcement telling residents to check for signs of The Fungus growing in their dorm room. While everybody now knows how to identify common signs of Fungal colonization, here are some more subtle and less obvious signs that it may have reached you!
Your roommate doesn't blink
Really, when was the last time you saw them blink? In fact, it seems like your roommate just never closes their eyes at all anymore! You might also notice their eyes wide open in the middle of the night, despite them being fast asleep. Either of these could be a sign of The Fungus. To be sure, try to gently wake up your roommate by whispering their name — if they stay unflinchingly wide-eyed and asleep, no matter how vigorously you shake them or scream at them, it could be a sign something is off. 
The dead insects in your lighting fixture come back to life
This is one of the most amazing things that The Fungus can do. All those dead beetles, flies, moths, and other such critters that collect on the inside of your ceiling sconce lights will come back to life! They do so with such tremendous vitality and vigor that the light pouring into your room will dance and flicker as these bugs zip back and forth in front of the bulb. The fixture itself might even begin to tremble slightly from the momentum of these vermin relentlessly hurling themselves against the wall in a desperate (but futile) attempt to escape their prison. Nobody is quite sure how The Fungus reanimates these little beasts, but it's always fascinating to watch.
Your RA is acting a little odd
If you ever notice that your RA starts texting your floor group chat with interesting facts about mycelia or spores a bit more frequently than usual, it might be worth checking to see if The Fungus has manifested somewhere in your building. To be fair, expressing a desire to share information about the most fascinating kingdom of Eukaryotes is not, on its own, a sign of anything amiss, but if your RA hasn't expressed such a fervent fungal fixation in the past it might be worth looking into!
The bad thoughts come back
Oh no. Oh dear. They've come back haven't they? You believed you had buried those secrets deep down, but The Fungus can hear your innermost thoughts as clearly as our ears hear speech. You were never subtle, not with The Fungus. Everything will be made plain soon enough.  
There is a mysterious cloak in your closet
A commonly reported side-effect of The Fungus is the appearance of a mysterious coat in one's closet. Typically, it's described as a long gray trench coat, with the shoulders so crooked and sleeves so gangly it seems to be made for a body not quite like ours. Many times, people describe finding strange items in the pockets of the coat, including frantically written notes scrawled in blood or childlike drawings of frightening scenes. Sometimes, people find objects in the pockets that end up being critical for them to survive the day!
Memory loss
If you notice that your roommate doesn't seem to close their eyes anymore, this might be a sign of The Fungus!
Your room no longer obeys Euclidean geometry
We all know our shapes. We sometimes take it for granted — three sides make a triangle, four right angles make a square, 360 degrees makes a circle, etc. But when the Fungus reaches maturity, it can do strange things. Left becomes up, down becomes backwards, and you scramble around your room trying to find the exit (which you could have sworn was never that small before!). Light bends in strange parabolic arcs as the photons seem to flee in fear from certain corners of the wall, leaving you to wonder what strange anomalies lie in the inky black extremities of your room.

The Four Horsemen have come once more to thrash us with accelerating and crashing waves of power riffs. “72 Seasons” marks Metallica’s return, their eleventh studio album following their 2016 project “Hardwired... to Self-Destruct.” Like “Hardwired,” this album stretches a little over 77 minutes, and whether that is welcomed depends entirely on the listener’s appetite for constant loudness. 
From start to finish, Metallica had two goals with “72 Seasons,” those being 1) to never slow down in tempo for any reason, and 2) to recapture what made “old Metallica"  — that being “Kill ‘Em All” (1983) to “The Black Album” (1991) — so popular. After all, it is those first five albums which define Metallica in people’s minds and their contributions to the evolution of sound. To both of these goals, “72 Seasons” over-accomplishes to an enervating degree. 
While debatable whether it is an issue at all, it is still worth mentioning that this album, despite its length, features zero ballads. Considering that many of the tracks of this album could be criticized as sounding like duplications of one another, ballads could have brought contrast between thunderous tracks. Metallica preferred to stampede over such an idea and relentlessly shred in substitution. While many of the songs are headbangers, lead singer James Hetfield has gotten more vocally confident over the past years in performances, and looking at their operatic dabbles in symphonic metal, they could have provided complex pieces similar to what they did in “...And Justice for All” (1988).
Tracks that are worth mentioning, “Lux Æterna”, “Inamorata”, and the title track “72 Seasons” all give what people want out of a Metallica album. That is to say, music that captures one’s love for absolute chaos and tempest. The songs’ incapacitating crescendos never cease to bring in interesting rhythms and roundabouts, obscuring what they might throw at you next. In fact, these songs sound like they could have come out in the 1980s, during Metallica’s heyday.
Many of the other tracks are also good, with “Too Far Gone?” and “Room of Mirrors” being more of melodic Heavy Metal than Thrash Metal, but still sounding like Metallica all the same. Though the album is overall good, not every song is, with the main problem being that the songs do not need to be as long as they are. There are 12 tracks on this album and 7 of them are over six minutes long. One of the great things about Thrash Metal as a genre, and as Metallica cemented it in the late 80s, was its promptitude. It is the speed at which the songs are presented that makes this type of music a joyride to listen to. Were some of the songs shortened by a one or two minutes, they would be far less bloated and far more memorable. 
This album is not bad. Though it is not among their absolute best, it is not as unlistenable as “Saint Anger” (2003), and will likely grow on people the more that it’s listened to. Were it released by another band, it would probably not be as sought-after, but considering how dedicated of a fanbase Metallica has, it's not surprising that people are conflicted on it. It is interesting to see that Metallica is still popular, even among young people, considering that the songs which they are primarily known for are over 30 years old now. While that could be seen as a referendum on them not releasing anything as notable in those 30 years, it should be preferred to say that it is commendable to see that their music has stood the test of time.

On Wednesday, April 19, the Undergraduate Student Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) met in Tepper Simmons Auditorium for their annual Joint Ratification Meeting (JRM). The JRM is a once-a-year meeting where the two student government bodies meet to approve the results of the student elections and budgets from the activities fee. 
Climate Action Resolution
The meeting opened with a vote to endorse J.R.22.09, titled “A Resolution on Climate Action.” This was proposed by the Climate Action Working Group of the Sustainability Initiative. The joint proposal has two main features. The first sets a goal of Carnegie Mellon having net-zero emissions by July 1, 2030 in both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Scope 1 emissions are direct (sources that are controlled or owned by an organization) and Scope 2 emissions are indirect (purchase of electricity, steam, heat, or cooling). 
The second part of the proposal outlines the formation of a Climate Action Planning Committee. It would develop “an actionable plan for 2030 to achieve a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions related to direct, Scope 1 emissions and indirect, Scope 2 emission by July 2030.” The committee will also make recommendations to measure Scope 3 emissions (Results of activities from assets not owned or controlled by the organization, but the organization indirectly affects in its value chain) and then make recommendations to address them.
The standing committee will have both undergraduate and graduate students and make recommendations to the Provost no later than April 30, 2024. The committee will focus on providing recommendations in ten areas — which are listed in the proposal — and will also provide an annual report of progress toward the 2030 net-zero emissions goal. 
With a vote of 25-0-1 in the Senate and 49-0-2 in GSA, the proposal will be delivered to the Office of the Provost later this month. 
Student Body Elections
The next section of the meeting was led by Election Board Chair Sarthak Bisht. The student body elections are run through a single transferable vote. For single-winner elections, this means that the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes are transferred to the voter’s next choice until one candidate has a majority. For multi-winner elections, candidates must meet a specified quota, and when they do, they win and their surplus votes are transferred. There is also a one percent minimum applied, which means executive candidates (Director of Finance, Director of Organizations) need at least one percent of votes from graduate and undergraduate students to win.
This year, the total turnout was 4.25 percent, a low in the past few years. 7.27 percent of undergraduates voted while 1.24 percent of graduate students voted. In the five years prior, the lowest turnouts had been 13.15 percent of undergraduates in 2019 and 1.88 percent of graduates in 2020. 
Elizabeth Fu was the winner of the Director of Finance position after three rounds of voting. A total of 412 ballots were cast and the winner needed 207 total votes and 69 graduate student votes to win. Daphne Han was the winner of the Director of Organizations after one round of voting. A total of 348 ballots were cast and the winner needed 175 total votes and 69 graduate student votes to win. 
The slate of Undergraduate Senate candidates was also looked at. In the School of Computer Science, seven seats were filled by six candidates; in the College of Engineering, 12 seats were filled by six candidates; in the College of Fine Arts, six seats were filled by four candidates; in Dietrich College, 10 seats were filled by 10 candidates; in the Mellon College of Science, six seats were filled by one candidate; in the Tepper School of Business, five seats were filled by three candidates; and in the BXA program, one seat was filled by one candidate. Any seat unfilled seat will be vacant in the upcoming school year until filled. 
A number of issues were also noted during the presentation. The Election Board was convened later in the Spring semester than usual “due to unclear constitutional language.” There was also a late start based on tech “due to the lack of a functional elections platform,” which required an emergency meeting. Also, a lack of internal participation from issues of quorum, communication, and internal participation slowed down the overall process. 
During the election process, students reported confusion about single transferable voting, including write-ins and no confidence votes. Additionally, as noted earlier, there was lower-than-expected turnout, which was attributed partially toward Election Board's failure to publicize elections well. It was also partially attributed to the elimination of the Student Body President and Student Body Vice President elections, which historically got the most attention in these elections. 
With votes of 24-0-2 in the Senate and 55-0-0 in GSA, the results of the elections were ratified. 
Student Government Executive Budget
The Student Government Executive Budget pays for Student Government operations, including line items like honorariums for the Director of Finance (DoF) and Director of Organizations (DoO), Joint Funding Committee (JFC) committee members, Student Government Staff, TartanConnect, and some other Student Government Infrastructure. In the budget, a total of $78,514.50 was proposed for student government, which was $3,720.32 over the $74,794.18 that it will be allocated. The total proposed budget is almost a 20 percent increase over last year, with the total allocation growing comparatively by five percent. 
Some noticeable increases are the honorariums for the DoF and DoO. Both positions currently pay $2,500, and the proposed budget increases the honorarium of DoF to $8,000 and the DoO to $5,000. According to DoF Clarissa Liang, this is to better reflect the amount of work these positions do and bring them into line with the salaries of the GSA President and Senate President. Another sizable increase was the JFC Meeting Food budget, which went to $5,400 from $3,150, a 71.43 percent increase. Liang explained that this was because of the increased frequency of meetings of the JFC. Additionally, an auditing committee will be formed, with a total budget of $4,902; this will cover the cost of honorariums and meeting food. The JFC piloted an auditing committee this past year and is looking to make it more official in the coming year.
Before the budget was voted on, an amendment was proposed to cut down the proposed line items of the DoF honorarium, DoO honorarium, and JFC food by $1,000 each. The amendment passed Senate 10-9-5 while it failed GSA 1-44-8. The final votes on the as-is proposed budget were 15-4-6 in the Senate and 47-2-3 in GSA, passing. 
Activities Board Elections and Budget
Activities Board (AB) is the programming arm of Carnegie Mellon’s student government that provides free events to the student body. AB is composed of six committees: Concerts, Films, Events, Speakers, Publicity, and Tech; Tech is operationally independent from AB. 
Each committee of AB is composed of one chair and one to two leads. AB Main/President, Internal and Finance Chairs oversee AB’s internal operations. To put into view how many students AB impacts, 2,250 concert tickets were sold to their last show (COIN at Spring Carnival), and multiple of their events like Chili Cookoff and Skate Night were at capacity. 
As part of AB’s internal processes, they have elections that are approved by the Senate and GSA during the JRM. As part of their elections, AB has a screening process to determine eligibility for AB Exec; candidates then have to give a one- to three- minute speech to current AB exec and the AB general body. There is then a series of internal discussions and then voting. The AB exec board that was brought before the Senate and GSA was passed.
Next, AB presented its FY24 Budget Request, which asked for a total of $627,135, or about 23.17 percent of the JFC Main budget. They went through how much each part of AB would be receiving under the proposed budget. AB Main was slated to receive $53,674, an increase of $22,000 from 2023 due to additional funds for honorariums and the National Association for Campus Activities. 
AB Concerts was requesting $297,550, up from $256,649 in 2023. The increased budget is a result of inflation and post-pandemic transition, desire to book more notable performers, and price increases in fees and agent costs. AB Films will be merged into AB Events moving forward. AB Events requested $86,111, which is slightly less than the combined AB Events and AB Films budget in 2023 of $86,423. AB Speakers requested $189,800 for the upcoming year, which is up from $126,340 in 2023. This increased budget is a result of increased artists and agent fees, desire to book higher profile artists, and high attendance at all events and utilization of funds. 
An important increase in the overall AB budget came from honorariums for next year. AB proposed in this budget that the Internal Team (AB President, Internal Development Chair, and Finance Chair) would each receive an honorarium of $8,000; Committee Chairs would receive an honorarium of $5,000; and Committee Leads would receive $4,000. A proposed amendment changed these values to $4,000, $3,000, and $2,000, respectively. This passed Senate 13-7-2 and passed GSA 37-13-0. A second amendment proposed that the honorariums be changed to $6,000, $5,000, and $4,000, respectively. This amendment failed in the Senate, 6-15-2. In a final vote of the AB budget, the amended budget passed Senate 22-1-1 and passed GSA unanimously. 
Second Round of JFC Appeals
After coming back from a short break, both the Senate and JFC voted to suspend quorum in case they fell below quorum at any point during the meeting. The Senate passed this 20-1-1 and the GSA passed this unanimously. 
Following this, the Senate and GSA heard the second round of JFC appeals. Each organization presented its appeal request, followed by its GSA and Senate sponsor sharing their rationale for sponsoring the appeal. The current DoF then presented the JFC’s rationale for rejection. The DoO and organization representatives then answered any questions. The appeal must pass with a 2/3 supermajority vote. There were a total of seven eligible appeals that were presented at the JRM. 
In order to do a second round appeal, a number of qualifications must have been met. The first is that the line items that were being appealed had to have been rejected by the JFC. Additionally, organizations must have sponsors from both GSA and Senate that do not have affiliation with the organization. The organization representative must also not be a member of GSA or Senate. The final qualification was that the line item does not meet the JFC’s FY24 metric cap. 
The first presented appeal was from Scottie Ventures, which was appealing for $1,090. Their line items that were cut include funds for a competition, recruitment, professional headshots, and a Crunchbase Pro Subscription. They were sponsored by Senate member Mason Xiao and GSA member Matthew Reeder. The Senate and JFC funded $790, which excluded the costs for meals during travel, which the JFC does not fund. The votes were 17-4-4 from the Senate and 50-1-1 for GSA.
The second presented appeal was from the Robotics Club, which requested $6,200 to build another buggy as part of their RoboBuggy project. They were asking for $4,000 for shell materials, $1,200 for microcontrollers, $500 for headlamps, $300 for flood lights, and $200 for servos. The appeal was sponsored by Xiao and GSA member Aditya Desai. The appeal was amended to $5,400 for shell materials, servos, and microcontrollers. The Senate approved the amended appeal 16-5-1, and the GSA approved the amended appeal 33-15-2. 
The third appeal was from Carnegie Mellon Racing, which asked for $13,550. These costs were associated with paying registration, travel, and lodging for competitions. There was a proposed amendment to change the cost for travel and lodging to $4,000 from $8,250. This proposed amendment failed in the Senate, 6-10-3. They then proceeded to vote on the entire proposal, which was rejected by the Senate, 6-13-2. 
The fourth presented appeal was from the Jewish Graduate Student Association for $5,800. The requested funds were to cover costs for kosher ingredients for Shabbat dinner and lunch events, wine for Shabbat dinner and lunch events, and wine for Jewish holiday ceremonies. The Senate sponsor was Ellie Fu and the GSA sponsor was Mitchell Fogelson. The appeal passed both the Senate and GSA.
The fifth presented appeal was from the Google Developer Student Club, which was requesting $1,000; they are a new organization on campus. They were asking for funds for advertising, their Solutions Challenges Final Hackathon, and food for general body meetings. The appeal was sponsored by Senate member Eunice Lee and GSA member Nandankumar Desai. The Senate voted first and rejected the appeal, 5-10-3. 
The sixth presented appeal was from Cru, which asked for $2,520. This money was to be used for a fall retreat, winter conference, food during general body meetings, and event supplies. The appeal was sponsored by Senate member Alexandria Donohue and GSA member Matthew Reeder. An amendment was made to remove the line items related to the fall retreat, which was passed by the Senate and GSA. The final vote on the amended appeal was 15-3-1, passing the Senate, and 23-4-3, passing GSA. 
The final presented appeal was from Tepper Finance Group, which asked for $2,000 for hosting their alumni event at a non-Carnegie Mellon venue. The appeal was sponsored by Donohue and GSA member Lucas Jia. The appeal was voted on and failed in the Senate, 9-9-2. 
Final JFC Budget Votes
To close the meeting, there were two more votes. The first was on the section of the JFC budget that included student honorariums and alcohol allocations, which needs a 2/3 supermajority vote to pass. There were no objections from the Senate or GSA, so this passed. The second vote was on the rest of the JFC budget, which also received no objections.

On April 12, Pittsburgh city council held its first public hearing on the topic of Spin E-scooters since their introduction to the city in July 2021. Spin’s partnership with Pittsburgh originated through a pilot program called Move PGH, an effort to provide city residents with more transportation options. The pilot program will end this July, so in preparation, legislators heard from Pittsburgh residents to help inform whether Spin should be offered a long-term contract or not.
What is Move PGH?
Move PGH is a program created through the Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI). DOMI director Kim Lucas explained in the city council meeting last week that the purpose of Move PGH is to “make transportation more affordable, more equitable, more sustainable, more accessible, and more efficient.” In addition to Spin scooters, Move PGH includes POGOH bike sharing, the Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT) public transportation system, and Zipcar car sharing. 
Part of Move PGH’s initiative is to provide more reliable transportation to higher-need areas of the city. This is put into practice through a 30 percent discount on a Spin scooter ride if a user unlocks a scooter in one of these areas, no matter where they ride after unlocking. 
Pittsburgh residents can also apply for the Spin Access program, which grants low-income resident an 80 percent discount on Spin rides. Currently, less than 400 people in Pittsburgh are part of this program. Out of the 200,000 unique users that Spin reports, this accounts for about 0.2 percent of all Spin users. 
City Council member Barb Warwick (D-District 5) noted this percentage in the public hearing, alongside another statistic that about 7 percent of users live in Spin Access zones, which is a much higher figure than those who the program is actually helping. This could be because Spin Access is not advertised clearly on the main app page, so many users do not know about the program.
How does Spin operate within Pittsburgh?
E-scooters are technically illegal to ride in Pennsylvania, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT). However, two years ago DOMI was authorized to issue Spin a permit to operate in Pittsburgh for the duration of the pilot program.
There are many rules surrounding the use of Spin scooters in Pittsburgh — some imposed by DOMI and PennDOT, others by Spin itself. First, there are the general rules of who can ride a Spin scooter: riders must be 18 years or older, there must be one rider per scooter, and riders must not weigh more than 220 pounds. 
For the city of Pittsburgh, people can only take scooters on roads with a speed limit of 25 mph or less. They cannot ride scooters on sidewalks, and scooters must be parked in parking lanes, not blocking any bus stops, ramps, or fire hydrants. In designated parking zones, scooters can also be parked in bike corrals or at Move PGH mobility hubs. Mobility hubs are located around certain districts of the city, offering places to charge the e-scooters and access other types of transit offered by Move PGH. Helmets are not required when riding a Spin scooter.
Spin has a penalty system for incorrect parking. When a rider parks, they must upload a picture of the scooter to the app. The app issues a warning if riders violate parking guidelines. If a user receives three warnings, they are suspended from using the Spin app. In the public hearing, the general manager for Spin scooters, Jason Shaffner, reported that 92 percent of riders who receive one penalty correct their behavior and do not receive a second one. 
Spin and the city of Pittsburgh do not exchange any money for their pilot program. Pittsburgh residents expressed concern in the public hearing about how Spin makes money. People argued that there are two paths for the future of Spin: either they go out of business, leaving people who rely on them to travel stranded, or they will increase prices, reducing access to the scooters. 
When Spin scooters are issued parking violations, the money goes to Spin, not the city. This means that Spin profits from scooters obstructing and disrupting the daily life of Pittsburgh residents.  
This is not the economic model that other cities have adopted with scooter-sharing companies. For example, Chicago stands to make about $4 million in scooter fees from their pilot program of bringing in multiple e-scooter sharing companies. E-scooter users in Chicago are charged a nine percent lease tax on every ride, and they must be locked to poles or bike racks at the end of a ride. 
While this means a price increase, it is inconsequential compared to the already very high cost of riding a Spin scooter. The organization Pittsburghers for Public Transit published a report comparing the cost of riding one mile using different kinds of transportation offered in Pittsburgh. Using the POGOH bike shares costs $0.63 per mile, a transit trip on the PRT system costs a flat rate of $2.50 even for much longer than a mile, and Spin scooters cost $4.32 per mile including the one dollar unlocking fee. This steep cost significantly limits the amount of people who can ride Spin scooters especially if used frequently for commuting to and from work, as the price does add up.
Are Spin scooters helping the environment?
Spin scooters are marketed as a better alternative to cars — an eco-friendly transit option. But research shows that that may not be the case. An environmental study conducted in Zurich in 2021 showed that shared e-scooters and shared e-bikes actually produce more emissions than the transportation modes that they replace, mainly walking and using public transit. According to the executive director of Pittsburghers for Public Transit, sources of emissions for e-scooters are their charging stations and the diesel vans operated by Spin that are patrolling the city streets placing new scooters, attending to scooter complaints, and making repairs. 
The Zurich study also found that personal e-scooters and e-bikes do in fact reduce emissions and are better alternatives to public transit. However, due to the illegality of personal e-scooters in Pennsylvania, the only transportation method available to Pennsylvania residents that actually helps the environment is biking, alongside walking or taking the bus.
According to a recent survey conducted by Spin, about one-third of all Spin scooter trips replace a car trip. While using small-vehicle transit like an e-bike or e-scooter is much more environmentally friendly than driving, it also causes road congestion.  This means that the city of Pittsburgh is effectively taking up more space to move the same number of people. 
A community member who is a current Pittsburgh resident and former data scientist at the Chicago Transit Authority expressed to the city council that “efficient use of space is the core problem of transportation… [In Pittsburgh] sidewalk space is already a scarce and precious public resource.” Her sentiment was echoed by many other speakers who believed that even if one day e-scooter technology advances so that they produce less emissions than walking or taking the bus, the problem of space would not be solved and those shared public transit options would still be the more environmentally conscious mode of transportation. 
Shortcomings of Spin scooters
Due to limitations in mobility, weight, age, sight, or economic situation, many people in Pittsburgh cannot even use Spin scooters. The biggest demographic of Spin users are people ages 18-34, with highest ridership in Pittsburgh neighborhoods such as Oakland, where there are universities and student housing. 
The biggest demographic of people who cannot use Spin scooters are people who are disabled. Not only can these individuals not ride on Spin scooters, they are heavily impacted by the parking of Spin scooters. During the public hearing, residents who were blind or in wheelchairs spoke out about the danger that Spin scooters pose to them in their daily lives. When Spin scooters are parked on sidewalks, where able-bodied people could walk by the scooter while staying on the sidewalk, people in wheelchairs are forced to go into the street to get around the scooter. This creates a dangerous situation, especially in a high-traffic area with a large volume of cars on the street. And for people who have vision impairments, sometimes canes do not always detect an obstruction in the sidewalk. For example, a blind woman reported running into a scooter’s handlebars that were sticking out into the sidewalk path even though the body of the scooter was parked on grass next to the sidewalk.
Aside from the physical danger that Spin scooters create for people with disabilities, they also exacerbate existing transportation inequalities in Pittsburgh. The high volume of broken or very narrow sidewalks in the city — along with the sometimes infrequent and unreliable bus system — already make transportation difficult for disabled people. Scooters do not fix this problem, they only offer a solution of more convenient transportation to the most able people. 
Now, the burden has been pushed onto disabled people to fight for the ability to make an accessible transit system possible. Multiple speakers at the hearing explained how Move PGH has offered no solutions to transit problems that disabled people face, rather, it is a program meant to cover up existing inequities with exciting new technology.
It is not only mobility or visually impaired people who cannot use the Spin scooters. A Pittsburgh Public Schools middle school teacher stood up in the city council hearing and explained just how limited Spin’s user base is. First of all, people must have a smartphone in order to use Spin scooters. People who need to carry things like groceries cannot use the scooters. Neither can parents who need to transport their young children. Therefore, scooters are only available to a certain demographic: “people who already have every opportunity handed to them,” said the teacher. 
Due to the geographic makeup of Pittsburgh, scooters are also inaccessible to people who live in neighborhoods that are very hilly. The engine of a small e-scooter is not powerful enough to get people up Pittsburgh hills, causing an increase in discarded scooters at the bottoms of hills. And due to the speed restriction where scooters must only travel on roads with less than a 25 mph speed limit, sometimes scooters cannot be used to connect people from one Pittsburgh neighborhood to another because they cannot go on highways. 
All of these restrictions on who can use Spin scooters show that the scooters are only broadly practical for young people traveling short distances, typically college students or tourists, and not the general public of Pittsburgh.
Long-term solutions
Move PGH intended to close "the last mile gap": the route from a person’s home to a transportation hub like a bus station. It applies conversely as well — the last mile could also be from a transportation hub to a person’s place of work. But young, able-bodied people are not the ones who need resources to help them with this last mile gap. 
The people who most need solutions to this are disabled people, as well as people who are low-income and people of color. Disabled people may not be physically able to traverse this last mile gap. And for people of color and low-income people, who have often been forced into living in areas of Pittsburgh without an abundance of transit options, the last mile may be much longer than for people who live in areas with lots of bus stops or bike-sharing locations.
The general consensus of the city council public hearing last Wednesday was that solutions to the problem of the last mile gap do not lie in bringing new technology like e-scooters to Pittsburgh. Instead, the solution is for the city to invest in affordable housing, building more bike lanes, improving sidewalk conditions, and increasing frequency and reliability of the bus system. Working toward these policies in the coming years will be crucial to building Pittsburgh into a city where every resident cab access the transit they need without worsening the transportation experience of others.

On Tuesday evening, the CMU-Alert system announced that there was a protest at the University of Pittsburgh, a building had collapsed, many police were there, and students should avoid the area around Fifth and Thackeray Avenue. 
Over 250 people had been protesting outside the O’Hara Student Center as Michael Knowles and Brad Polumbo debated whether laws should regulate “transgenderism.” The Pitt News reported that at 7:34 p.m. “a combination of a firework and smoke bomb” went off, the sound of an explosion echoing through campus. But there was no building collapse. 
Twenty minutes after its original message, CMU-Alert sent a follow-up that “building collapse” had been sent in error. 
According to media relations director Peter Kerwin, the person who sent the notification accidentally included part of a template message. The mistake in the original alert was “ex: bldg collapse.”
Kerwin told The Tartan that because CMU-Alerts are time sensitive, the system has default scripts that include locations and response guidance, such as “avoid the area,” “shelter in place,” “evacuate,” or “run - hide - fight.” Community members can learn more about these protocols on the Emergency and Preparedness Response page.
The CMU Emergency Preparedness and Response Team drafts and sends CMU-Alerts. The group includes representatives from the University Police Department, Enterprise Risk Management, Office of General Counsel, University Communications & Marketing, and Student Affairs. They send a message if there is an immediate threat to campus safety. 
After using a script for initial alerts, Kerwin said, the team typically crafts more detailed messages. At that point more Emergency Preparedness and Response Team members are involved and collaborate on the notifications. 
CMU-Alert sent five messages on Tuesday: the initial one at 8:16 p.m., the correction, two updates that the protest was ongoing, and a 10:19 p.m. “all clear” when the protest ended. 
Vice President for Operations Daryl Weinert sent an email to the Carnegie Mellon community at 10:35 p.m. to address the mistake. “Though we quickly corrected the message, we are aware this likely caused concern,” he wrote, adding that the University is “taking steps to ensure such an error doesn’t recur.”

Throughout April, numerous Pentagon documents were leaked onto internet boards across platforms, revealing classified information about U.S. government actions. The documents discussed intelligence spying on U.S. enemies and allies, the Russo-Ukraine War, the use and development of weapons by other countries, and other national security issues. 
Originally, U.S. officials said officials that Russian spies were likely behind this major intelligence breach. In reality, it was Airman First Class Jack Teixeira, a 21-year-old man living with his parents in Dighton, Mass. and serving on the National Guard. Teixeira posted photocopies of the Pentagon documents on a Minecraft discord server called “Thug Shaker Central.” He leaked over 100 pages of documents, which seem to be from the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) of the State Department (DOS), the National Security Agency (NSA), and even the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). According to sources, Teixeira wished to keep these documents within the server as a way for other members to make their own opinions from unfiltered and unanalyzed data and information rather than circulated news on television and media platforms. 
There are a number of disparities between what the media has reported and what the documents say. According to the BBC, the storyline that Ukrainian forces are holding their own against the Russian war machine is one that we should question. 
Leaked battle analysis documents show that the chances of Ukrainian victory are “catastrophically” low compared to what Americans have been told, with talk of surrender circulating among forces with depleted morale. Meanwhile, Russian Spetsnaz commando units have been butchered by Ukrainian forces while on a number of high-risk special missions such as the capture and execution of Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Spetsnaz’s casualties were only estimated in a few units, but all show severe losses across most deployed brigades, such as the 346th brigade, who “lost nearly the entire brigade with only 125 personnel active out of 900 deployed.”
Other alarming discoveries include that there are a number of Western Special Force units on the ground in Ukraine, including American forces. While this American contingent is not on the frontlines against the Russians, we have at least 14 soldiers within the U.S. embassy in Kyiv to provide government oversight on the provisions that the U.S. has been granting to the Ukrainian war effort. 
The United States Intelligence has been revealed to have been eavesdropping on a number of parties regarding our relations with the East, as well as non-citizens that use websites by American-owned companies. United Nations chief Antonio Guterres, who the U.S. has claimed to be weak on Russia, has been tapped by U.S. spies for the past few months. Everything from South Korea’s National Security Council and North Korea’s weapons programs to Colombia, Nicaragua and the Gulf Cartel in Mexico has been under watch by U.S. Intelligence in gauging where countries and organizations are moving considering the increasing temperatures on the global stage. 
Information on Egypt has also surfaced, including the fact that 40,000 missiles that Egypt has manufactured were planned to be shipped to Russia, with the United States actively knowing about this. Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi is considered one of America’s closest allies when it comes to Middle Eastern relations, and has been the benefactor of much of American foreign aid. According to a document, Sisi wished to keep the production and shipment of the 40,000 rockets confidential “to avoid problems with the West.”
All of these discoveries have brought into question the security of these documents, considering the level of confidentiality and age of the leaker. The 21-year-old has been charged on two counts under the Espionage Act, while the government is now reeling to clean the mess caused, as despite the U.S. Intelligence being arguably the most sophisticated information gathering system in the world, it has the possibility to be breached by simple overlooked safeguards. The Federal Government is likely to enact further measures to prevent further intelligence breaches as we continue to see the fallout of this leak come to fruition.

The Chinese Communist Party has again broken international law, in the same vein as their secret detention of Swedish book writer Gui Minhai and their Operation Fox Hunt campaign. Last week, the FBI arrested two members of the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in Manhattan due to the illegal operation of an overseas secret police department with the sole purpose of silencing critics and political opponents of the CCP.
According to Politico, Beijing has been operating a number of illegal outposts across the world, including places like London, Tokyo, and Rome, as a remote arm of China’s security network. Advocacy groups which have begun as opponents to these overseas secret police stations estimate at least 100 countries throughout the world have these facilities seeking to harass international Chinese citizens.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry has gone on record in the past rejecting the accusation of China cracking down on dissent, claiming instead that these outposts are for international Chinese people to assist in “renewing their driver’s licenses” and that the operation is completely conducted within international law. On other occasions, Chinese spokespeople have completely denied the existence of these outposts or denied them as related to Chinese police personnel, claiming that to be disinformation aimed at dividing foreign relations between the world and the Chinese government. 
In late 2022, multiple countries began investigations into these outposts, as establishing unregistered police stations on foreign soil is a violation of countries’ sovereignties. A few weeks later, the FBI raided a building in Chinatown, Manhattan, finding evidence of the CCP targeting Chinese-Americans as a way of surveillance. More evidence showed that propaganda was being distributed from these stations to local communities. 
According to the New York Times, the propaganda would consist of stories of people, when a crime is committed against them, seeking Chinese police outposts rather than local authorities, where justice can be served for them through “negotiation and education” of criminals. 
The FBI furthered the investigation into these stations, and have arrested two men operating an illegal Ministry of Public Security police station on the charges of conspiring to act as agents of the PRC and obstructing justice by destruction of evidence of their communications with an MPS official. Records held on the two men show they have a history of assisting the PRC government’s repressive activities on U.S. soil. One of the men participated in counter-protests against members of a religion that is forbidden under PRC law in Washington D.C., circa 2015. In 2018, the same man was enlisted into an operation of blackmail and harassment of a Chinese refugee to return back to the PRC. The victim reported that threats of violence against them and their family were made. In 2022, the man was involved in locating and silencing a pro-democracy activist living in California.
The man denies having done any of these activities, despite the mounting evidence against him. Furthermore, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security claims not to know the two men at all. The men are both facing a maximum of 25 years for both charges. U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Breon Peace made a statement on these findings: “Today’s charges are a crystal clear response to the P.R.C. that we are onto you, we know what you’re doing and we will stop it from happening in the United States of America.”
The Federal Government plans to crack down further into these outposts that are harassing innocent Americans and further preventing the illegal depredations of the CCP on internationals. As more information comes out from what the CCP is doing, it is possible that their reach in “public security” may span further than previously believed.

The past two weeks have been a tumultuous time for the abortion pill. Here’s a timeline of recent events: 
Friday, April 7: A U.S. District judge in Texas rules to place a national ban on access to the FDA-approved mifepristone abortion pill on the basis of it being unsafe 
Friday, April 7: A Washington state judge bans U.S. authorities from changing abortion pill access in 17 states 
Wednesday, April 12: A federal appeals court allows partial access to mifepristone, but limits access to seven weeks of pregnancy instead of the previous ten and prohibits mail delivery
Thursday, April 13: Biden files an emergency request for the Supreme Court to overturn the federal ruling 
Wednesday, April 19: The maker of the generic abortion pill sues the FDA over damages from restricted access to this medication 
Friday, April 21: The Supreme Court temporarily preserves access to the pill, preventing states from acting under the federal judge's ruling
On Friday evening, Matthew Kacsmaryk, a U.S. District judge in Texas, ruled to suspend the FDA’s approval of one of the two drugs used to induce abortions — mifepristone. The ruling would not take effect for a week, giving the FDA time to appeal the decision. Kacsmaryk’s ruling challenged the initial approval of the pill from the early 2000s and the more recent decision that allows the pill to be prescribed via telehealth and available in pharmacies. His ruling was based on concerns about the possible negative reactions; however, there is no evidence to question the pill’s safety. The judge, who worked for a conservative Christian legal advocacy group and has no scientific expertise, is also a known supporter of the anti-abortion movement. 
This is the first time a judge has questioned the FDA’s approval and removed access to a drug available on the market. Not only would this ruling affect thousands of women who rely on medical abortions, but it would set a precedent to allow the removal of any drug and completely disband the system that is the FDA. 
That same evening, a Washington state federal judge, together with over a dozen democratic states, issued an order to block the FDA from changing access to the pill. Not only did the judge’s ruling maintain access to the pill in Democratic states, but the contrasting ruling increased the likelihood of the case going to the Supreme Court. 
That Friday night, Biden promised to “fight [the Texas] ruling” and the Justice Department stated that it “strongly disagrees” with the Texas ruling and “is committed to protecting American’s access to legal reproductive care." Despite these promises, anti-abortion groups took the Texas ruling as a victory. 
The following Monday, the Biden administration filed an emergency request for the appeals court to block the ruling, saying that the Texas judge made a series of errors, including filing the lawsuit. 
On Wednesday, the federal appeals court ruled on partial access to the mifepristone pill while the case is being appealed. They imposed two limitations: changing the approved time from 10 weeks to seven weeks of pregnancy and ruling that the pill could no longer be sent by mail. The Biden administration then appealed this decision to the Supreme Court in an effort to maintain existing access. At the same time, Massachusetts, California, and Washington announced they were stockpiling abortion pills to ensure a supply even if mifepristone would be pulled from the market. Even if the Texas ruling suspended mifepristone, it would not affect the use of pills already in states’ possessions. 
A week later, GenBioPro, the producer of the generic version of mifepristone, sued the FDA in an effort to maintain federal access to the pill. The lawsuit is based on the idea that revoking the approval of generic mifepristone would cause “catastrophic harm” to the company and doctors and patients who rely on it. The generic version, which was approved in 2019, accounts for two-thirds of mifepristone sold nationally and is being targeted in the Texas ruling. The company also opposed the Texas decision, saying it would disincentive companies from developing new mediation if they would lose protections provided by the FDA. 
Last Saturday, two weeks after the initial Texas ruling, the Supreme Court ordered to maintain access to mifepristone. This was a temporary decision, but it sent a strong message: ruling against the FDA and removing an approved drug from access is too far. After this ruling, the case returns to the court that made the Wednesday decision to allow partial access to the pill. The court will hear the argument on May 17. Regardless of how that court rules, the losing side will likely appeal to the Supreme Court, which will have the choice to make a ruling. 
While the future of mifepristone remains unclear, some scholars believe the Friday ruling is a sign the Supreme Court is sticking to its promise of staying out of abortion laws. Also, mifepristone is the first of two pills used to administer abortions, and doctors are preparing for a future where only the second, misoprostol, is used. To learn more about how abortion pills work, read Anna Capella’s article in SciTech.

On Tuesday, April 18, a crowd of people gathered on the campus of Pitt to protest a debate being held between Michael Knowles, a transphobic political commentator, and Brad Polumbo, a right-leaning, libertarian journalist. The protests garnered much attention when law enforcement became involved after a series of small incendiary devices went off. The editorial board of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette condemned the actions of the demonstrators, as did an opinion piece in NewsWeek. 
The debate was the third in a series of speaking events held by Pitt student groups to discuss trans identities. As Tartan EdBoard has said before, and as we will continue to affirm, trans identities are real and are not up for debate. Anti-trans rhetoric is being used as a divisive culture-war issue, and the safety and well-being of trans individuals are being affected as a result. It is of particular importance that we emphasize this, because trans individuals are a very vulnerable population due to this recent rise in bigotry.
Knowles' specific claim which caused outrage is his belief that "transgenderism" must be eradicated. This phrasing allows him to hide behind the defense that he was merely advocating against the "ideology" of transgenderism, not the elimination of individuals. It was a carefully crafted statement that fed into the very real and prevalent exterminationist rhetoric against trans people, while affording him plausible deniability. We don't believe that people owe civility to those who advocate exterminationist rhetoric against their community, and we believe that the anger and aggression of the protestors at Pitt is justified. 
Around 250 people gathered to protest the event at around 5 p.m., with chants and speeches to rally the attendees. But by 7:30 p.m., city and campus police had shut down the streets and buildings around O'Hara St and Thackeray Ave after a series of smoke bombs and fireworks were detonated. In addition, an effigy of Michael Knowles was set on fire in the street.
When a protest makes this turn it very rapidly becomes a very different situation. A fire is unpredictable; crowds around fire can become unpredictable, and such a crowd can cause police to become unpredictable. Smoke bombs and fireworks (despite being considered harmless enough in Pennsylvania for teenagers to purchase), can nonetheless be frightening and cause a crowd to react in bad ways. Loud incendiary devices can also be mistaken for gunfire or explosives.
The situation had resolved by around 10:08 p.m., when Pitt Police gave clearance for people to re-enter the buildings that had been on lockdown. While the situation ultimately proved relatively harmless, there are some important points to make about this event.
In the summer of 2020, Portland, Oregon experienced some of the longest and most confrontational demonstrations against the police in U.S. history, as the city was gripped by over 100 consecutive days of protests and riots against police brutality. The most dedicated contingent of protestors developed strategies and formed networks to distribute resources, because sustaining such protests for an entire summer required tremendous effort. Obviously Portland is an extreme case, however, it serves as a historical reminder that aggressive demonstration tactics require a special set of considerations. Sustainable collective effort is what makes the most effective demonstrations, and if one chooses to participate in such a protest they must be extra considerate of their own safety. 
Furthermore, in the midst of a protest with unpredictable actors and high tensions, misinformation can rapidly spread. This is very easily shown by the emergency alert sent out by Carnegie Mellon at around 8 p.m. on Tuesday. The subject of the email contained very few details, but implied that a building had collapsed. At the time, it was only known that an "incendiary device" had been detonated at the protest.
Thankfully nobody was hurt at Pitt this week, and the willingness of people from around Pittsburgh to stand against transphobia is heartening to witness. However, it always remains important to be vigilant and cautious at such gatherings, especially at ones with the potential to become unpredictable.

Novel-tea is The Tartan’s literary and language opinion column, so if you like hot takes and reading about cool ideas in the literary community then this is the place for you!! If you have your own hot take to add to this column, do not hesitate to contact us.
Earlier this year, I wrote an article about book lists and my anxiety about the fact that too many books exist to be able to read them all. Readers around the world have this anxiety, and many in the book world try to consume hundreds of books a year. It can be overwhelming to meet people that read even ten books in a month. They leave you scratching your head, wondering how they manage to do it. While impressive, I struggle to believe this lifestyle is enjoyable for all readers. How are you supposed to truly engage with a book if you’ve only picked it up for a weekend? 
John Miedema, the author of Slow Reading (2009), explains in an article for The Guardian, “If you want the deep experience of a book, if you want to internalise it, to mix an author's ideas with your own and make it a more personal experience, you have to read it slowly.” However, this is extremely difficult in a world where we are all losing our attention spans. Many book lovers are eager to finish their current read and move onto the next, newest recommendation. People are often bombarded with new recs before they can even look at the books they have already bought. 
This takes the fun out of reading! Being introduced to new thoughts, characters, and ideas isn’t useful if you aren’t able to engage with them. Take classics for example — most people know or have heard about classic literature, and many return to these again and again. Why? Because there are infinite ways to look at and internalize them. I don’t read books just to say I’ve read them, but to get something out of them — whether that's to learn, or just to enjoy reading. At least for me, in order to truly engage with a book, I have to spend time reading it.
Loving a book is a truly special experience, one that shouldn’t be tampered with just to reach an arbitrary goal. Doing something for your own enjoyment means slowing down and actually letting yourself savor it, not rushing to the next thing. 
People pour their hearts and souls in writing and editing their stories, so take the time to truly admire, critique, and understand your favorite authors. However cheesy it may be, reading is about quality, not quantity. In my mind, reading one book that sticks with you is worth more than reading a hundred books that don’t. 
So stop rushing. Leave the hustle and bustle for your day job, and for once let yourself appreciate the few moments you take for yourself. And, as always, happy reading!

A few days ago, I was talking to a friend of mine who became a nurse after high school. He’d worked his ass off to get that job, putting in way more hours than anyone else to get his training and license done. I don’t pretend to know how nursing works, but I knew he’d gone through a lot to get his job. 
He’d been in the medical industry for about four years, and yesterday, he told me something I’d never thought I’d hear.
He was quitting his job, and heading to an online college to do computer science. Not because he particularly enjoyed computer science — hell, from what I understood, he hated it. But it was work, and it would probably get him a job. And there was no earthly way he would continue being a nurse.
The pandemic burned out our nurses. It had been day in, day out, trying to keep people alive. Beds overflowed, and when deaths spiked over summer, they were pulling more hours, understaffed, underpaid, and overwhelmed.
It’s not just nursing. The pandemic changed work environments across the country. Dozens of senior level managers, close to retirement age, packed their bags and left. People were unemployed, and yet, there was a job shortage. 
It continued long past the end of the pandemic. Inflation has been rising, and the economy has been anemic. Manufacturing, especially in the U.S., faces a recession, led by the auto industry. Tech, the golden child of all careers, has dried up too, with Facebook — sorry Meta — Google, Netflix, and Apple facing layoff after layoff.
What the hell happened?
The tech bubble was always going to be unsustainable. Tech ebbs and flows, each time focusing on some cool new piece of science that they cheer on, and then get burned out on. In the 2000s, it was the dot com bubble. In the last few years it's been blockchain, NFTs, crypto, and “the cloud” — and now, AI is coming to take our jobs and the sky is falling.
Tech overhired, picking up dozens of devs to capitalize on how terminally online everyone was over the pandemic. Blockchain scammers and crypto hacks marketed their careers to dozens of people, who became unemployed when the rug was eventually pulled.
Nursing couldn’t find enough people, and they worked what they had to the bone. Now, nurses are quitting, and the ones that are left are being worked ever harder.
Manufacturing shuttered doors, the plants stopped working due to health shutdowns, and now, because of shutdowns in other parts of the world, they can’t get the things they need to produce.
And while all this is happening, low-wage labor, the quintessential no-questions-asked job, has been facing fewer and fewer applicants. The service sector is still seeing labor shortages, as people are unwilling to come in to work, not caring enough about the abysmal wages they’re being offered.
It’s not just us. The economy isn’t just in the shitter, to put it lightly, because the U.S. is struggling. Our semiconductor woes are because of Taiwan, our manufacturing crisis partially because of Taiwan, China, and Europe. Germany is facing its own manufacturing crisis — the once-bulwark of the EU’s economy now slowing to a crawl. China has regulated and re-regulated its economy over and over again, each time with more notice of how shaky it is. The global economy, the humming center of the world, which took pears from Argentina and put them in a little plastic cup in a Wawa off the interstate, is still feeling the aftereffects of the virus.
It doesn’t help that the Russians decided to invade Ukraine. Ukraine is a massive grain exporter, and the Russian’s butchering of Ukrainian shipping lines has made famine far more likely in surrounding countries supported by Ukrainian grain. Financial giants are now far warier of investing in Europe, China, or Russia, with all three facing the backlash from the conflict as the EU tries to figure out how to make it go away. Ukraine, on the other hand, is taking pummelling after pummelling, and finance in Europe is scared of what the war’s continuation means.
It’s hard to imagine a solution for this problem; the economy is a slow, annoying beast. It can take months for policy to impact people (by which time brain-eating aliens might have landed in Paris.) But, the hope is that things will change. Metrics keep pointing towards things getting better, and by and large, they’re less bad than they were before. Sure the economy is still pretty bad, but hey, it could always be worse!
The hope is that 2023 is the last year of the slump, and most analysts predict global growth as investment spikes in 2024 and beyond, especially in alternative energy. When the war in Ukraine ends, there will be billions pouring into the industry of that country, which will improve the economy of a number of countries as well. Things should, hopefully, get better.
Knock on wood.

I’ve been described as many things over the years — brutally honest, blunt, delicate as a jackhammer — but the question I’ve always asked myself is why does every single one of those phrases have a negative connotation? What’s wrong with being honest? Is it really that hard to share what’s going on in our heads? 
Being honest doesn’t necessarily just mean "not lying." According to Psychology Today, being open and honest with people will help strengthen relationships. Being open with the people around you creates a “richer level of intimacy” and a more firm foundation for the relationship — honesty is about expanding communication. Listening openly and sharing one's feelings can build real trust. It can definitely be hard to be open sometimes, but in the end it’s worth it because of the way that it strengthens all of our relationships. 
College is a time when you'll find yourself navigating a lot of new social situations, and I think that by prioritizing honesty you'll save yourself a lot of grief and drama. I can easily think of a time when being open and listening would’ve been beneficial to a relationship. A friend of mine had a roommate that she was planning on living with again the following school year; it had been something they'd discussed. But just a week before the housing deadline, my friend was informed that her roommate was considering living with someone else instead. The follow-up conversation never happened, and the two aren't living together anymore. The lapse in communication was a serious hurdle in their relationship. To be fair, better communication could certainly have come from both ends. However, I think that if my friend's roommate had been more open and honest about wanting to switch roommates it would have benefited both parties. 
A lack of honesty can also impact a person’s health. The American Psychological Association performed a study on honesty and how it affects both mental and physical health. They determined that the group that was told not to lie reported having less headaches, stress, sore throats, and tense feelings than the control group. Additionally, people in the "no-lie" group reported that their relationships had been stronger since they had been forced to be completely honest and they felt like their communication skills had improved significantly. The conclusion of the study was that by being open about how we feel we can not only improve our relationships, but also our overall health. 
To provide the inverse of the above example, there are times when uncomfortable honesty can be the better choice. I once had a friend bail on vacation plans because he didn't want to hang out with a group of only girls. It might not have been the nicest excuse, but I’m grateful for the honesty. The truth definitely sets me free, so that’s what I try to do for other people. 
Now of course, I don't think you should go around saying every little thing on your mind, especially if you don't have anything positive to say. However, if someone invites you to do something and you don’t want to, just tell them! If someone is being rude, be straight up and ask them why. If you want to bail on your roommate, tell them as soon as possible so they actually have time to make other arrangements. Is it too much to ask for people to be honest?
As James E. Faust would say “Honesty is more than not lying. It is truth telling, truth speaking, truth living and truth loving.” So sure, the truth can hurt, but who cares? I’ll take the truth over an excuse any day.

Imagine, if you will, you are a student at one of the most rigorous, pseudo-ivy league learning institutions on the East Coast. The school’s reputation is one of all-nighters, hours of homework, and allegedly having the third most depressed student body in all of America. Now imagine that once a year, right before finals, the school turns into a fair. A four-day long celebration, complete with carnival rides, overpriced junk foods, strange school traditions, and darties to spare. Above all, it is a time of relaxation for the student body. Or at least it's supposed to be. Finally, imagine you are assigned work — one presentation, four readings, and two projects — due the Monday after the fair gets torn down. How are you supposed to enjoy the festivities with all these looming deadlines? Perhaps unsurprisingly, many Carnegie Mellon students don’t have to imagine this situation, as they lived through it last weekend.
My plea to the professors of Carnegie Mellon is a simple one: please stop assigning work over Carnival weekend. Carnival is supposed to be the last hurrah before finals season, just let the students enjoy it and plan your schedule around the four-day weekend! You may think to yourself “The workload this week is light, one assignment can’t be that bad,” but I assure you, that is what every professor is also currently thinking. The work won’t get done, and you’ll be left with students bullshitting their way through a conversation about a Shakespeare play that no one read. Or, the work will get done, and it will be bad. More grading for you, a worse grade for the student, it is a lose-lose situation, people!
And you know what? All of you professors deserve a break as well. I can only imagine that you love grading finals as much as we love taking them. So enjoy the weather, take your kids out on carnival rides, and just, for everyone’s sake, cut the students a break with the homework. Please and thank you.

Two weeks ago, The Fence was the subject of a political controversy after it was vandalized to protest a “Free Palestine” statement written upon it. Last Monday, the very next paint job it received read “When Life Gives You Lemons, Drop Them.” To what this new statement referred was unclear. If this was an advertisement of an upcoming event or a group wishing to relay some important message, it was a terrible job. Yet a group of people got together and decided to make this statement anyways. Why?
A better question to ask is “Why not?” In this school year alone, The Fence has been subject to a handful of vandalizations and disputes. Every month or so, it is the face of some political agenda. This happened when CMU Republicans painted The Fence just prior to midterms last November, onto which what may have been syrup was spilled onto The Fence. This prompted the University to issue a statement disapproving Fence vandalism, seeing it as a censorship of free speech. Another time, when The Fence stood against the predations of the Chinese Communist Party on human rights, someone desecrated The Fence with profanity. And now with what happened last week, one must think if these social statements, whatever they may be, are so constructive that they are prompting civil discussion on topics.
Everyone should have a right to paint The Fence however they wish, and the University has affirmed that. The Fence  is, however, also subjecting the entire University to a number of divisive issues and unprompted bursts of emotion from some people who wish to befoul the statement painted. 
Political and social issues used to occupy much less space in the public consciousness, and it was easier for people with opposing beliefs to get along despite their different opinions. Such relationships are very rare nowadays, and it is things like The Fence pressing hot button issues that brings nothing but timber to an already raging inferno.
Something worth noting is that in the past few years, many topics formerly on the margins of political discussion are coming to the forefront. It is obvious that with more conversations, a more open-minded community should flourish — in theory. A world of open discussion should bring with it a diversity of ideas and opinions, and inversely, a silenced world is one that hosts bigotry. However, it has come to question for many if this theory is proving fruitful and bringing about what we'd hoped it would. Political debates have become such a well of vitriol that one cannot help but grow weary of the fact that seemingly every platform is appropriated into a method to grandstand. 
The Fence, in its original practices, was a way in which organizations advertised house parties and events, but never or only rarely a political stance. I don’t believe I am the only one in saying that it is a breath of fresh air when The Fence is something that isn’t a bleeding argument. I’m not advocating for the total censorship of people who wish to paint The Fence for whatever they wish, but if more people were organized to paint The Fence to something that isn’t going to get people riled up, we would all be able to enjoy the peace of life more often.

Last week I read a headline about a Nebraska Republican defending a six-week abortion ban because white people were being replaced. After checking that I had read it correctly, I wanted to know more. In his statement, Senator Steve Erdman was referring to the “Great Replacement Theory.” The theory, based in eugenics and white supremacy, states that white people are being purposefully replaced by people of color. 
These ideas more than a century in extremist groups — it was championed by Hitler in Nazi-Germany, and has been part of the rhetoric of the Ku Klux Klan for a long time. This idea persisted in neo-Nazi and neo-Confederate groups, then moved online into alt-right communities, and now has entered mainstream culture and politics. 
The term "great replacement" was popularized by French writer Renaud Camus in his 2011 essay stating that white Europeans were being replaced by Muslim immigrants. It gained popularity in U.S. mainstream media after white nationalists, perhaps offended by being perceived as “white trash,” developed a pseudoscientific explanation for their racism. In America, Great Replacement Theory focuses on Jews as the mastermind behind white replacement. It states — bear with me — that Jews have evolved to be smarter and more controlling than native-born Americans. They are tricking white women into having babies with people of color and tricking white men to become transgender to make the population less white and easier to control.
At the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, North Carolina, attendants chanted “you will not replace us” and “Jews will not replace us.” Tactics like these are used to attract young supporters. They also spread fear of immigrants, attacks on white freedom, and anti-Christian sentiment — all common talking points of mainstream republicans. The end motive is to gain political power, and by spreading watered-down versions of their ideologies, they are able to achieve it. 
White supremacy is the natural conclusion of Trumpism. Trump himself told the Proud Boys, a militant far-right group, to “stand back and stand by” during the 2020 presidential debates instead of condemning them. They received that as a statement of endorsement, and say it led to an increase in participants. 
Examples of these ideas spreading in popular consciousness are everywhere. Tucker Carlson, a Fox News anchor, discussed how the Democratic party is importing people from the third world to be “more obedient voters” in an effort “to replace the current electorate.” White nationalists write books and articles explaining how white people evolved to have higher IQs and commit less crimes. By claiming these differences are evolutionary and not based on systemic oppression and racism they undermine government efforts to increase diversity and equality. 
These ideas are also the basis of a lot of far-right politics, bringing us back to what pulled me into this terrifying subculture: the Nebraska Senator supporting abortion bans as a tactic to increase white births to counteract immigration. Ironically, abortion bans disproportionately affect people of color, which suggests that banning abortion will only increase the birthrate of people of color — but that isn’t the point. Their lack of logical consistency isn't an aberration, it's half the point; There is nothing rational or fact-based about white replacement theory. It's an ideology entirely based entirely on fear and the perception of a threat, and people can use it to defend whatever backwards policies they want. The fact that an elected official is able to stand up and openly admit that replacement theory is his motivator for policy making foreshadows a grim future, one that I am terrified of.

We’ve all watched the Mario movie at this point, right? It seems like it, because “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” has broken the record for animated movies in opening box-office earnings. The plumber brought in $369 million worldwide in its opening weekend, beating out the previous record of $358 million. Who was the biggest record holder? “Frozen II.”
I’d never particularly cared about box-office records, but it was interesting to me that “Frozen II” was previously the top earner. In my childhood, Disney sequels were markedly unsuccessful compared to their original features and were largely direct-to-video. So the top spot being held not by the original “Frozen” but by its sequel felt like wildly new territory for Disney. Now "Frozen II" has been toppled by the Mario movie. If you’re curious about the other top opening earners for animated movies, the list goes as such:
There’s something of note here: almost all of these movies are adaptations. Now obviously all stories contain influences from other sources — after all, "The Lion King" is just a "Hamlet" retelling — but most of these are straight up sequels or adaptations of existing properties. Initially, this list made me a little sad. Do original movies just not have the same pull? Is the animation industry doomed to a fate of recycling the same franchises ad nauseam?
For anyone who sympathizes with these concerns, I think there are a couple of key factors here that might give us some hope. Firstly, that list is specifically for earnings in the opening run. It does make sense that sequels would do well in this category, if people enjoyed the original property then there’s incentive to see the adaptation, regardless of if it’s good. Looking at the highest grossing animated films of all time, a number of non-adaptations like “Frozen” and “Zootopia” make the list. Furthermore, these adaptations are doing well because a lot of time, effort, and money goes into them. Those old Disney direct-to-video sequels were a lot less successful than the originals, but were also a lot worse. Most of the animation in the sequels was outsourced and made at a much lower budget. “Frozen II” looks arguably better than the original with the animation done in-house and at a comparable budget. Anyone who watches the Mario Movie might notice something about them: a ton of care went into crafting this adaptation. So yes it’s definitely successful partially because it’s cashing in on the franchise’s fame, but it’s also just a well written movie that is rich in character and detail. 
I think the “Super Mario Bros. Movie” shows that despite the industry leaning heavily on adaptations, with proper time, development, and marketing, the animation industry still has a lot to offer creatively.
