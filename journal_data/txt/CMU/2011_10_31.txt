The Carnegie Mellon swimming and diving team returned home from a successful weekend at the University of Rochester Saturday evening. Starting their season out in a double dual meet, the Tartans went up against the Rochester Yellowjackets, followed by the New York University Violets and the Case Western Reserve University Spartans.
The women swept their three meets, ending with over 200 points against each opponent. Starting the meet off strong on Friday, first-year Debbie Lin, junior Branna Stillo, sophomore Soleil Phan, and first-year Kelley Sheehan won the 400-yard medley relay with a 4:03.60 time. With new members on the team, the women stayed close and used their teamwork to steal the victory.
Phan also placed first in the 200-yard individual medley, the second individual event of the evening, with a time of 2:13.91.
Lin, Stillo, Phan, and Sheehan started off Saturday’s meet with a victory in the 200-yard medley. Despite being in only her first year at Carnegie Mellon, Sheehan pushed the competition aside and went on to win the 100-yard backstroke race with a time of 1:02.38. 
On the deeper end of the pool, senior Olivia DeFazio placed second on the one-meter diving board and seventh on the three-meter board. Junior Price Kinney won one of the last races of the meet, the 200-yard breaststroke, in 2:32.63.
The men opened up their season with victories against the University of Rochester and New York University, but they lost to Case Western Reserve University.
First-years Michael Kellman and Cole Um and sophomores Terrence Wong and Eddie Sears swam the first event of the day, placing third with a time of 3:35.83 in the 400-yard medley relay.
Junior Dan Glaser-Garbrick claimed a victory in the 200-yard individual medley event with a time of 2:00.09. On Sunday, he won the 200-yard butterfly with a time of 1:56.47 and the 400-yard individual medley in 4:14.95.
The Yee brothers later swept the 200-yard freestyle race, with first-year Andrew emerging victorious only 0.86 seconds in front of his brother, junior Brandon, with a time of 1:46.45.
Senior Mike Alexovich was fifth on the one-meter and sixth on the three-meter diving boards, while senior Eli Fatsi placed fourth on the one-meter and three-meter boards.
“The women’s team had a strong start and will probably have a very good University Athletic Association meet,” senior Jen Sung said, “and the men’s team is very young, so there is hope for them as well.”
The Tartans will have their next meet at home on Saturday at 11 a.m. against Clarion University.

On Saturday, the Tartans’ football team took on the Bears from Washington University in St. Louis. The Tartans lost for the second straight week, 14–7, in this UAA conference matchup.
“Defense holds strong while our offense struggles,” junior outside linebacker Owen Parker said after Saturday’s game. 
The Tartans found the end zone halfway through the first quarter, putting the first points of the game on the board. Senior running back Chris Garcia ended a 10-play, 65-yard drive with a one-yard touchdown run. Sophomore quarterback Rob Kalkstein was a perfect five for five on the drive, throwing for 50 yards.
Despite the game’s unfavorable results, Kalkstein completed 71.4 percent of his passes and threw 171 yards. Four of those passes were to senior tight end Zach Gallup for 61 yards, a career high for Gallup.
A late first-half drive by the Bears knotted the game up at seven. After a nine-play, 80-yard drive, Wash. U. quarterback Dan Burkett found wide receiver Drew Sexton in the end zone on an 18-yard pass with 1:03 left in the half. 
Early in the second half, Carnegie Mellon junior cornerback Sam Thompson ended a Bears drive with his first interception of the day on Burkett.
With the Tartans unable to capitalize on the interception and continuing to turn the ball over on downs, Burkett completed a 77-yard touchdown pass to senior receiver Easton Knott to put the Bears up 14–7.
The Tartans quickly gave up possession after that Bears touchdown. Kalkstein threw his only pick of the game to Bears first-year defensive back Ryan Bednar. That interception was Kalkstein’s first mistake of the game, ending a streak of 10 straight completed passes. 
After the Kalkstein interception, Wash. U. coach Larry Kindborn called a reverse pass by backup quarterback Eric Daginella. But the play backfired on the Bears, as Thompson intercepted his UAA-leading fifth ball of the season, his second of the game.
Thompson’s five picks have him at all-time third place in Tartans franchise history in a single season. He is two away from the record set by Andy Helms in 1991.
Late in the fourth quarter, the Tartans’ defense made a huge stop and burned all three timeouts to get the back ball on their own nine-yard line with just 2:39 left to play.
Kalkstein led the Tartans 71 yards, completing four of six passes for 59 yards. But with just 18 seconds left in the ballgame, Kalkstein was sacked and the Bears held onto the 14–7 lead to win the game.
“It’s tough to play in a close game like that and know you’re one play away from the win,” junior safety Anthony Lorubbio said. “We played sound defensively, forcing a few key turnovers, but still came up just a bit short.”
Carnegie Mellon’s defense was stalwart in this game, holding the Bears to eight points and 32 yards under their season averages. On top of Thompson’s two interceptions, junior linebacker Nick Karabin led the Tartans with 12 tackles, breaking his single-game record of 11. Unfortunately, the Tartans’ stellar defense was all for naught, with their offense being held to a season low of 134 yards.
The Tartans look to end their two-game slide on Saturday at the University of Chicago in a conference matchup against the Maroons. The game starts at 1 p.m.

We are hitting the middle of the NFL season this weekend, and it has already brought a ton of surprises. Teams that were expected to be championship contenders, like the Philadelphia Eagles, have started out slow, and teams were expected to perform badly, such as the San Francisco 49ers, have excelled so far. Even with many playoff teams competing for their lives in Week 7, one game dominated the headlines. The two teams that were competing only had one win between them, yet it seemed like everyone’s eyes were on this game. Why? Because the legendary Tim Tebow was making his first start of the 2011 season for the Denver Broncos.
Broncos fans had been calling for Tebow to start in place of the former starting quarterback, Kyle Orton, since the beginning of the season. However, head coach John Fox decided to go with Orton, a 2010 Pro Bowler, for the first seven games of the season, with little success. With the pressure on Fox, he decided to name Tebow, the former Florida Gator star and two-time national champion, as the permanent starter for the rest of the year.
For the past two years, Tebow has been one of the most controversial players in the game, starting from the day he was drafted. Many experts, such as ESPN’s Todd McShay, known to be one of the premiere analysts in college football, have repeatedly claimed that Tebow has no shot at being a successful quarterback in the National Football League, based on his flawed mechanics and inability to throw the football well on the run. However, pro-Tebow arguments state that he is a proven winner, one who has the “it” factor that it takes to win in the NFL. Those who have spoken with Tebow say that he is down-to-earth, is a great leader, and will do whatever it takes to win. Not to mention his extremely religious attitude, which makes him an extremely low-risk player when it comes to off-the-field issues.
Fast-forwarding to the game, Tebow led his Broncos to an epic 18–15 win in overtime. However, the final result does not tell the real story. Throughout the first three quarters, Tebow literally could not hit water if he fell out of a boat. Multiple times he missed wide-open receivers to whom any other starting and potentially backup QB in the NFL could have thrown. Not only that, he often could not make basic QB reads, leading him to spend too much time in the pocket. The stat sheet shows this, as Tebow was sacked seven times by the woeful Miami Dolphins defense, one of the worst pass-rushing teams in the league before this game.
While watching the game, I was repeatedly amazed that Tebow was even on the roster of any NFL team, let alone on the field as a starting QB. He would often run around in aimlessly in circles, and it was inevitable that he was going to get sacked. For three quarters it was a disaster.Then came the fourth quarter, where Tebow proved his fans correct for a time. He somehow found the ability to throw, and he led the Broncos to an amazing fourth-quarter comeback in which they scored 15 points in less than three minutes. Although it took a lot of luck to win the game, including a successful onside kick, Tebow supporters will point to his ability to win games as the reason why the Broncos won. However, Tebow supporters fail to recognize that Tebow did not win the game for the Broncos. In fact, the defense did, with a key strip-sack of Dolphins QB Matt Moore at Miami’s own 35-yard line, where the Broncos took over. Looking to move the ball a little bit closer, Tebow was unable to move the ball just one yard, and the Broncos had to rely on a Matt Prater 50-plus-yard field goal in order to win it in overtime. Not to mention they were playing against what is arguably the worst defense and team in the league.
All in all, there was an unimpressive win over a poorly playing team, where the QB did more bad than good. I don’t understand why anyone thinks that Tebow is a good player, let alone a franchise QB, but we will find out in the next few weeks.

On Wednesday, the Tartans hosted their last home volleyball game of the season, a change from the University Athletic Association round robins from the past few weekends. Carnegie Mellon played a non-conference game against Frostburg State University, dominating the Bobcats 3–1. The scores of each game were 25–20, 25–18, 21–25, and 25–17, with the Tartans dropping the third game. 
At the games, the seniors on the team were honored for the time, effort, and dedication that they have shown Carnegie Mellon throughout the years.
For the Tartan offense, first-year Ali Celentano led the Tartans with 21 kills; sophomore Rachel Miller was a close second with 17. Miller also put up four service aces for the team. 
Another key performance came from sophomore Emily Wright, who had five digs, three blocks, and 29 assists.
First-years Taylor Bell and Ali Nichols were significant contributors to the Tartan victory as well. Bell had seven assists, three kills, and four blocks, while Nichols had 14 digs and two service aces.
On Saturday, the Tartans hit the road and traveled to Johns Hopkins Univeristy in Baltimore. Here the Tartans first played the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays, coming up short in a 3–0 loss. It was a rough match for the team, as the offense was not as strong as in the prior game.
After the 3–0 loss, Carnegie Mellon bounced back with a decisive 3–1 victory over the University of Mary Washington. 
After last week’s short break from UAA games, the Tartans currently sit one game above .500 at 14–13. 
Next weekend, the Tartans return to UAA round robins and will travel to New York University for this year’s UAA Championship.
“After this weekend we know what we have to do to prepare ourselves for next weekend, and we are ready to work hard,” sophomore Amy Friedman said.

The 2011 World Series has concluded with the St. Louis Cardinals hoisting the Commissioner’s Trophy. It wasn’t too long ago that the Cardinals were on the outside of the National League wildcard race looking in, but lo and behold, the Red Birds overcame a mountain of odds and ended up World Series Champions.
A month before the end of the regular season, the Cardinals were looking up at the Atlanta Braves in the wildcard race. The Braves towered 10.5 games over the Cardinals in a race that had little chance to be the neck-and-neck race that the NL wildcard race ended up becoming.
After the Cardinals fought into the thick of the race, the last game of the regular season came down to a win-or-go-home situation for both the Cards and Braves. As you all know, the Cards won in story-book fashion.
But still, after barely sneaking into the playoffs, who would have thought they would win the whole thing? They had to play the heavily favored Philadelphia Phillies in the first round.
Cards ace Chris Carpenter had to come up big in a decisive game five and defeat the Cy Young candidate and future Hall of Famer Roy Halladay. You all know how the story goes: The underdog came out on top.
The Cardinals made quicker work of the NL Central champions, the Milwaukee Brewers. The series ended in six games, the Cards winning 4–2, pushing the boundaries of improbability.
A World Series matchup pitting the Texas Rangers against the St. Louis Cardinals could not have had two more contrasting teams and stories. The Rangers coasted to the playoffs without much pressure from the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim chasing them for the division crown. They boasted arguably the most potent offense in all of baseball, finishing third in runs (855), first in batting average (.283), fifth in on-base percentage (.340), and second in slugging percentage (.460).
The Cardinals found themselves down 3–2 with the series coming back to St. Louis for game six. The stage was set for the greatest World Series game ever played in the vibrant history of Major League Baseball, rivaling the seventh game of the 1960 World Series, when Bill Mazeroski homered in the ninth for the Pittsburgh Pirates to beat the New York Yankees.
With every jab the Rangers threw, seemingly knocking out the Cards, they kept getting right back up to throw a punch of their own. They were the Rocky Balboa of the World Series. They continually lagged, especially when behind 7–5 in the ninth inning, and even more so when down to their last strike. Then David Freese threw a ferocious jab of his own.
With two outs and two strikes, Freese bombed a triple to deep right, just over the glove of Rangers right fielder Nelson Cruz, to score Albert Pujols and Lance Berkman. The game was knotted at seven.
After the Rangers fought back with a two-run home run to right field by Josh Hamilton, the Cards seemed out for the count. But they came through yet again, getting up off the mat to continue the fight. A Ryan Theriot ground out to third scored one, and a Lance Berkman single scored another, tying the game yet again at nine.
An inning later, history was made with just one swing of the bat. Again, Freese was the hero. An 11th-inning home run gave the Cards the 10–9 win, also making Freese the first player ever to tie a World Series game in the ninth and get the game-winning hit in extra innings. The Cards were still alive, and it was time for one of the most treasured phrases in all of sports: “game seven.”
Besides game seven being, well, game seven, it paled in excitement to game six. Nonetheless, the Cardinals won, completing one of the greatest underdog tales in sports history. 
How did the Cardinals defeat the monster offense of the Rangers and the vastly favored opponents that preceded?
Ten and a half games back, just one strike from losing, and then just one strike from losing again, the Cardinals were able to overcome monstrous adversity. 
So, don’t ask me how they did it, because there is no viable explanation. I don’t even think the players know how they did it. The only thing I can say is that the Cardinals were fighters; they were naysayers, and they were determined. The odds were never in their favor, but that did not stop them.
Just revel in the fact that we all just watched one of the most historic World Series ever played and, in game six, the most exciting World Series game ever played.
The 2011 World Series Champions are the St. Louis Cardinals, a result that perfectly caps this classic sports underdog tale.

Cèilidh weekend at Carnegie Mellon provided an exciting game for the Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team. The Tartans hosted the New York University Violets, a University Athletic Association rival, on Friday; Carnegie Mellon beat the Violets 2–1 in double overtime.
The Tartan offense had four shots on goal during the first half of the game. Sophomore Scott Gerfen had the first shot, followed by shots from first-year Mark Nicholas and sophomore Max Tassano. The fourth shot was a free kick taken by first-year Jakob Rohwer. The ball bounced inside the six-yard box, over two Tartan players, and into the Violets’ goal. This gave the Tartans a 1–0 lead. 
The Tartans had another opportunity to score on a penalty kick; however, the kick taken by sophomore Chris Wysocki hit the cross bar and deflected out of the goal area. The score remained 1–0.
Twenty minutes after the Tartan goal, the Violets’ scored to tie the score at 1–1. It started with the Violets shot on goal that was knocked away by sophomore goal keeper Christopher Madden. The Violets still recovered control of the ball and put it in the net.
With the game tied at 1–1 at the end of the second half, the first overtime period began. It was a very tight game since both teams were fighting for a game-winning goal. Junior Alex Abedian had an opportunity and centered a pass; however, the Tartans were unable to convert the pass into a goal. 
As the first overtime ran out, a second overtime began. It took only two minutes into the second overtime for the Tartans to pull it together and score the winning goal. Senior Carmen Minella passed the ball to senior Kyle Young; Young then crossed the ball to Wysocki, who headed it past the goalie to win the game.
“We had an incredible game on Friday. Although we had a tough game [Sunday], I believe we will be ready to face Emory on Saturday,” said senior Ian Epperson.
The Tartans travel to Atlanta to take on the No. 5-ranked Emory University on Saturday.

The creation of Carnegie Mellon’s Andrew network, developing a Jeopardy!-competing supercomputer, and making a global business last for 100 years were just a few things IBM executives had to talk about during their centennial celebration lecture at Carnegie Mellon on Oct. 20.
This year marks the 100th year of IBM’s existence as a corporation. In 1962, just a few months after IBM turned 50 years old, then-CEO Thomas Watson Jr. explained how only two of the top 25 corporations in 1900 had survived through 1962, displaying how much of a feat it was for IBM to survive for 50 years. Similarly, of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies in 1962, IBM is one of six that still remained last year.
“Figures like these help to remind us that corporations are expendable and that success at best is an impermanent achievement which can, at all times, slip out of hand,” Wayne Balta, vice president of corporate and environmental affairs and product safety at IBM, said at the anniversary event. Balta received a degree in civil engineering from Carnegie Mellon in 1982.
IBM’s lecture aimed to review the different insights the company has gained throughout the past 100 years. “We don’t do this as only an occasion to celebrate our past, but instead we are looking ahead and thinking hard about what our 100-year history tells us about the world today and tomorrow,” Balta said.
Balta said that the corporation has learned three important lessons over the past 100 years. First, IBM’s leadership learned how an organization must change as the world economy changes. By creating and dispersing many sectors of IBM in many different countries “in order to operate amid the crazy quilt of regulations and trade barriers,” IBM became one of the earliest examples of a multinational company. 
Second, the corporation learned how to change in response to changes in technology. Balta claimed that the most profound impact in the technological world has come from information technology and from how people can communicate across the globe. 
The last lesson Balta mentioned was that an organization “must remain the same at its core, in the face of a changing world.” 
Balta also touched on the topic of environmental sustainability as one of the issues people face when looking toward the future. He lauded the establishment of the Green Design Institute at Carnegie Mellon and said that organizations worldwide should be asking themselves how they can keep sustainability as a priority, especially when the concept leaves the platform of mainstream media. “After all, it’s easy to be green when everyone’s watching. But real leadership involves what you do when no one’s watching,” he said.
“There have been a number of really notable innovations that have come out of Carnegie Mellon’s work with IBM over the years,” Carnegie Mellon Provost Mark Kamlet said at the lecture. One of the projects he mentioned was a prototype for a computing environment. “That project led to creation of the Andrew computing network, and CMU became the first university with a completely wired campus,” he said.
In addition to the Andrew computing network, Carnegie Mellon and IBM collaborated with other institutions around the world to build Watson, a supercomputer designed to answer questions in natural language. Watson appeared on national television when it competed on Jeopardy! against former show champions, and it also came to the Carnegie Mellon campus to compete in a Jeopardy!-like game show against students from both Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh. According to EWeek.com, IBM recently introduced an application that provides content analytics similar to those programmed in Watson with the goal of helping to make diagnoses — but not treatment decisions — in hospitals.
Kamlet reflected on these collaborative efforts by saying, “We are very, very grateful and hope the partnership continues to thrive on both sides in the future.”

Did you know manufacturing a dollar’s worth of dog food requires the use of approximately 200 gallons of water? Other industrial processes — such as egg production, electricity generation, and many types of farming — are even more costly in water use per dollar. For example, for one dollar’s worth of output from grain farming, approximately 1,400 gallons of water are used.
These totals, calculated by Carnegie Mellon researchers, consider water use in all steps of a production process. In the case of dog food, there is of course the water used in factory where the dog food is the final product. There also is the water required to raise the meat and nurture the grains used as the raw ingredients. Water is also used in the generation of electricity that powers the factory, and so on.
Carnegie Mellon students Michael Blackhurst and Jordi Sels I Vidal, and professor of civil and environmental engineering Chris Hendrickson, added up the contribution of water use from every economic activity that contributes to the production of dog food, as well as many other industrial processes.
Cobbling together data from disparate sources, such as a water use statistics from the United States Geological Survey and a recent report on water use from the Canadian government, the researchers estimated the total water usage per dollar of economic output for all 427 sectors of the U.S. economy as defined by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
Before their 2010 paper “Direct and Indirect Water Withdrawals for U.S. Industrial Sectors” was published in Environmental Science & Technology (ES&T), there existed very little data on water use from individual economic sectors. The last comprehensive study of this kind was performed by the U.S. Census Bureau in 1982, so the current work “fills a very important gap,” said University of California at Berkeley professor Arpad Horvath. “They provided a practical piece of research that will be useful for a long time,” he said in a commentary piece also published in ES&T.
Readers should be aware that the study uses national economic data; regional water use data vary widely. However, nationwide figures are useful for informing policy decisions on water.
In future work, Hendrickson and colleagues intend to differentiate different types of water use.  For instance, water used for cooling in power generation would be categorized differently from water mixed with other chemicals or used in a chemical reaction. 
“We are [currently] trying to make the distinction between renewable water versus non-renewable water that is being taken out of the hydrologic cycle,” Hendrickson said.
Hendrickson is one of the developers of Economic Input-Output Life-Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA), a method used to estimate the broad impacts of economic activities from greenhouse gas emissions and water use to land use and transportation. Last week he was inducted into the National Academy of Engineering for his contributions in the fields of life-cycle assessment and green design.
The consumption of resources, considered over the life cycle of a single, seemingly simple product, can be enormous, with far-reaching impacts. “Back in the early ’90s, I got interested in green design. We were worried about how to do green computers and green chemical processes. That’s where I started,” Hendrickson explained. Very quickly, he saw that to truly be green in designing products, he needed information on the whole life cycle. “You have got to worry not only about the manufacturing phase, but also the use phase, the disposal phase....”
Twenty years later, Hendrickson is now diagnosing the water-use footprint of the entire U.S. economy.
What shocked Hendrickson the most about his results? It wasn’t that tree nut farming uses more water than melon farming, or that hundreds of gallons of water are consumed in order for Fido or Rover to eat their dinner. Hendrickson takes a more macro view: “My general surprise is just at how much water we use.”

Water for drinking is a necessity typically associated with high standards. As such, we adopt measures to ensure we drink the kind of water we want. Some people feel safe and comfortable drinking water straight from the tap; others choose to only drink bottled or filtered water. Is one method better than the other?
In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set up certain standards for drinking water that ensure that tap water will be “safe to drink for healthy people,” according to the EPA publication “Filtration Facts.” These standards are among the highest in the world, and they set levels for contaminants that can be found in water; the maximum levels are low enough that they will not harm healthy people.
Generally, to meet these standards, water treatment plants follow a series of processes to filter water. Water is first extracted from either above or below ground; water coming from underground tends to be cleaner because it has been sheltered from many pollutants. Extracted water then goes through the process of coagulation: Alum, iron salts, or organic materials are added to the water, and the mixture is left to settle. The added particles attract dirt and other impurities to form big sticky particles called “floc,” which slowly settle.
The water left on top is then filtered, passing through layers of increasingly fine filters made of materials such as sand, stone, and charcoal. Finally, chlorine and other chemicals are added to the water to disinfect it and kill off any harmful microorganisms. The treated water can then be sent off to individual consumers who use it in various ways.
Such filtering and treatment processes usually make water clean enough to meet everyday needs. Still, many people prefer to further filter water in their own homes for several reasons.
The Water Resources Research Center, a research group at the University of Arizona that studies water policy issues, outlines a few reasons why people reject tap water. At-risk groups such as pregnant women and people with fragile immune systems prefer alternatives to plain tap water because their special health requirements make it necessary for them to only drink very pure water. Some at-risk groups say they don’t like the taste of tap water, and others suspect their tap water is not as pure as it should be.
There are several reasons people might not receive water that meets EPA or other cleanliness standards. Pipes that supply water to homes can be old and can leak impurities, and some water treatment plants might not meet the necessary standards for water quality. Consumers can check this by asking their local plant for a report on water quality. They can also access an online database, such as the one created and maintained by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) that analyzes the quality of water in different communities. The EWG is a nonprofit that collects data related to health issues and makes them more accessible to the public.
Research conducted by the EWG shows that there are 300 contaminants present in drinking water for which the government has set no limits. In addition, the water supply for around 50 million Americans doesn’t meet the standards set by the EPA because of an excess of at least one pollutant. Statistics like these could be the reason for the growing popularity of home filtration systems.
More than 40 percent of Americans now use a personal water filtration system, according to the EPA. Home filtration systems come in several types and use many different methods. Most of the cheapest systems available are carbon filters. The carbon in these filters traps most contaminants and only lets water and minute impurities through. One of the downsides of using these systems is the users need to make sure they replace the carbon filter regularly to ensure maximum effectiveness.
For those looking to remove almost every contaminant from their water, a reverse-osmosis unit is effective. These units tend to be more expensive, costing around $100, but they do a more complete job of cleaning water by passing it through a semi-permeable membrane using very high pressure. Ultraviolet light is also used in some water filters to kill any microorganisms that might be present, but this UV light cannot remove chemical or physical contaminants. Combinations of reverse-osmosis and other technologies are available for people who wish to extensively filter their tap water.

Daniel Jacobs is a 6'5'' junior studying electrical and computer engineering, with a personality large enough to match his height. While his interests in math and physics might not set him drastically different from other engineering students, his enthusiasm for robotics very well might. This passion propelled him to a position this past summer as a Carnegie Mellon undergraduate robotics researcher.
“I’m inspired to do robotics by the idea of not just creating a mechanical device, but making it do — at least seemingly — some intelligent tasks,” Jacobs said. “It could be as simple as a line-following robot.... It seems trivial to [make a robot] follow a line, but at the same time it’s still an intelligent task.”
Despite his humble claims, Jacobs’ research focuses on what most would consider to be nontrivial: autonomous robotic mapping. Specifically, he programmed a quadrotor helicopter — typically referred to as just a quadrotor — to essentially fly itself while simultaneously describing, or mapping, its local environment. This type of research is useful for further advancing 3-D indoor mapping technologies, which helps architects, law enforcement personnel, emergency first responders, and others do their jobs more efficiently.
The CMUQuadrotor research team, composed of Carnegie Mellon Robotics Club members including Jacobs, is attempting to create an autonomous craft capable of navigating both indoor and outdoor environments with the aid of a Microsoft Kinect sensor.
“There are about 10 of us working on the project,” Jacobs said. “Our goal is to have it working by the end of this school year.”
In addition to work on the quadrotor, Jacobs serves as the Robotics Club’s electronics master, managing the club’s large inventory and making sure required parts are in stock.
His official duties as student, researcher, and electronics master aside, he also takes time out of his schedule to advise current and prospective students on robotics. Jacobs indicated that robotics research had always interested him during high school, and it was partly what motivated him to come to Carnegie Mellon.
“Research is taking some larger goal, breaking it down into a series of tasks, setting goals, and steadily working your way to the larger goal,” Jacobs observed. “CMU seemed to have the best people doing this.... I thought it was very interesting and I wanted to be there.”
So what was his favorite moment as a researcher?  Jacobs didn’t hesitate too long before answering.
“There was the whole ‘I just made that thing fly down the hallway just based on its camera feed’ moment,” he said. “Basically, the ‘it actually works’ moment… that was awesome.”

Humans may face shortage of water
According to “The World’s Water,” the Pacific Institute’s regular report on global water usage, more than 2 million people die each year from preventable waterborne diseases. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the world’s population is expected to exceed 7 billion early next year — more people will need water and more efforts will be required to raise efficiency of water use. “New thinking about solutions and sustainable water planning and management, better data, case studies, and efforts to raise awareness are all needed,” Peter Gleick, a water expert and president of the Pacific Institute for Studies, wrote in the report.

Simplified food label proposed
At the request of Congress, the Institute of Medicine submitted a report on Oct. 20 about establishing a simplified label that would go on the front of food packages to show how many calories the food contains, along with a health rating system of zero to three stars. This rating system would be based only on added sugars, sodium, and saturated or trans fats. According to the report, these types of nutrients are the ones that people tend to over-consume. The report also claims that these nutrients are the ones most associated with major illnesses such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

Invasive fish is focus of cuisine
The Oyster Recovery Partnership, an Annapolis, Md.-based environmental organization, has been asking people to eat a problematic fish for the sake of the environment. The snakehead, an aggressive predatory fish native to Asia and Africa capable of dominating rivers and lakes, has been found populating parts of Maryland and Florida. Leaders of the initiative hope that convincing commercial fishermen to pursue snakeheads and sell them at fish markets will prove to be more effective than poisoning or draining rivers and lakes, as has been done in the past.

Japan spends more for decontamination
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda approved $13 billion on Oct. 21 to be put towards cleaning up the areas contaminated by radiation at the Daiichi nuclear power plant in Fukushima, the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. Noda claimed that the decontamination was “a prerequisite for people to return to their homelands.” Radiation around the plant has forced nearly 80,000 people to leave their homes. To date, the government has raised $2.9 billion for decontaminating the area and will allocate more funding in the future.

Scientists explain painful sounds
Researchers in Cologne, Germany, have shown that unpleasant sounds such as nails scratching on a chalkboard induce actual physical reactions in listeners, such as increased heart rate, blood pressure, and electrical conductivity of the listeners’ skin. The researchers propose that the ear canal may be to blame, as previous studies have shown that the ear canal amplifies sounds with frequencies very similar to the unpleasant sounds used in this study, inflicting pain in the listeners. Researchers say knowing these details about unpleasant sounds can help engineers know which frequencies to modify when designing such things as vacuum cleaners and factory machinery.

Study confirms climate change
Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley have released an independent climate change study, stating in the report that “global warming is real.” The study shows that, since the mid-1950s, the world’s average land temperature has risen by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. The researchers claim that their statistical analysis of nearly 39,000 land-based temperature stations includes not only more stations than previous studies have used, but that their results are also more transparent and easier for other groups to reproduce and analyze.

A Mountie riding an elephant, the Japanese flag, and the initials “TPC”: These were the only clues the Activities Board provided on its posters as to the identity of the headlining band for its fall concert. While they might seem unrelated, these clues make sense once you know Tokyo Police Club is coming to perform at Carnegie Mellon on Nov. 12.
Tokyo Police Club is a Canadian band that released its first LP, Elephant Shell — hence the Mountie riding an elephant — in 2008, which Pitchfork noted in its review for its “consistently easy-on-the-ears sound.”
AB Concerts was first drawn to booking Tokyo Police Club because “they were really energetic,” said Lynn Streja, a senior studying human-computer interaction and information systems and a co-chair of AB Concerts. “Especially since it’s Pittsburgh and it’s winter and it’s cold, we really like to bring those high-energy shows.”
“We thought they were very marketable,” added Lyuba Zeylikman, a senior studying economics and psychology and the other co-chair of AB Concerts. “So we thought that people who did not hear them previously would be interested in them and ... hear their music when we play it on the Cut for them and be like, ‘Hey, this is cool, this is appealing to me.’”
The decision to book Tokyo Police Club was not a quick one, though. Zeylikman said, “The process sort of starts as soon as the spring [Carnival] show ends.” “I think even pretty early in the summer Lyuba and I were keeping in touch and sort of brainstorming,” Streja said. “We also made a priority to get in touch with our committee and to recruit new committee members over the summer.... We did try to get as much feedback and get as many ideas down as early in the year as possible.”
When planning the concert, “we try to take into consideration what, of course, we think will appeal to the student body,” Streja said. “AB as a whole has four different organizations [Concerts, Coffeehouse, Underground, and Skibo] that bring music to campus, and our group only has two concerts a year. They’re the biggest concerts, so we try to work on having a broad appeal, and obviously we also have a really restricted budget.”
Eventually, AB Concerts narrowed the list down to Tokyo Police Club because of the group’s energy and talent. “I also spoke to a lot of people who had seen them live and thought that the quality of their performance was really high and thought that they were super talented,” Streja said. “And that’s obviously something that’s really important to us — I mean, we try to balance getting that broad appeal with getting people that are super talented musicians, and that’s definitely something that we saw in them.”
So far, reception of the announcement has been mixed. “Tokyo Police Club is one of my favorite bands, and it’s really great that they’re coming here,” said Celine Berger, a sophomore undeclared H&SS student and an AB Underground chair.
Alex Price, a junior business major, was critical of AB’s choice, though. He described Tokyo Police Club as “very of-the-moment music that won’t have any meaning in 10 years.” He said, “AB’s had a lot better acts in the past. I think their goal for the bigger concerts should be getting someone who’s musically interesting... [meaning] they don’t sound the same as everyone else, they’re not just doing the same old thing.”
Squarely in between the two strong opinions is Chris Perrone, a senior electrical and computer engineering major. “I have heard of them, but I have never heard their music,” he admitted.
That’s okay with AB Concerts, though — “That’s exactly the kind of vibe we hope to get,” Streja said. “When we have this limited budget in the fall, a big thing is like you haven’t heard of the band, you listen to them, and then you get pumped and then you come [to the concert], so that’s something we try to build.”
Tokyo Police Club will be at Carnegie Mellon Nov. 12; the opening act will be a Pittsburgh rock group called 1, 2, 3.

From childhood friends to international indie rock stars, Tokyo Police Club has come a long way in recent years. The members of Tokyo Police Club began making music together in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada, during elementary school. According to guitarist Josh Hook, “We’ve been friends since fourth grade, so we started making music in late elementary school and into early high school. We started playing as this band in 2005. In early 2005 we played our first show, and then we’ve just been going since then.”
The band released its debut EP, A Lesson in Crime, in 2006 on Paper Bag Records. With songs like “Nature of the Experiment,” Tokyo Police Club established itself as a group of talented songwriters and musicians with a knack for catchy guitar riffs. Influenced by the garage rock revival of Radiohead’s Kid A and The Strokes’ This Is It, Tokyo Police Club has gained a large fan base and has released a total of three studio albums and two EPs. The band’s 2010 album, Champ, was well received by critics and fans alike. The upbeat songs and lighter lyrical content showed the more comfortable, relaxed nature of the band in light of its 2008 debut LP, Elephant Shell.
Tokyo Police Club’s most recent album, released on Oct. 4, is a cover project titled Ten Songs, Ten Hours, Ten Days, Ten Years. For this project, the band’s members chose a song from each year from 2001 to 2011; they spent 10 hours a day in the studio for 10 days, writing and recording their cover of one of the chosen songs each day. Originally, the project started as a simple way to get back into writing songs, but it later grew into a larger idea.
According to Hook, “To cover a song, you get to be creative without the ‘one, two, three, go’ of ‘you’re writing an album right now.’ Then, from just wanting to cover songs and get back into a writing mode, we let it evolve.” The album features a wide variety of songs from both popular and lesser-known bands, including M83’s “Kim & Jessie,” Miley Cyrus’ “Party in the USA,” and Moby’s “Southside.” “It was a cool mix of both,” he said. “Some were intimidating, and others were a little bit more easy to deal with.”
Some songs off the album allowed the band more creative freedom than others. Hook mentioned “Strictly Game” by Harlem Shakes as one example. “Judging by the response, they weren’t as well known as, say, Moby or someone like that, so it was fun for people to not have expectations,” he said.
His favorite song off the newest album is the Moby cover. This was the first song the band recorded for this project and, according to Hook, “We had just gotten everything set, flown to Los Angeles, and were just thinking, ‘What the hell are we going to do? Are we actually going to be able to put a song out in 10 hours or one day?’ So to have that first one done was kind of reassuring.”
The project allowed the bandmates to play many different styles of music and provided them with musical experience they wouldn’t have had otherwise. Confident that this experience will have some effect on the band’s own sound, Hook said, “Those elements that were previously foreign to us will probably make their way into our writing process.” He was quick to add, however, “I don’t think it’ll turn out to be exactly like ‘Party in the USA.’”
Tokyo Police Club has been enjoying some time off recently, a luxury the group doesn’t often have. According to Hook, the friends are all ready to get back in the game and have been throwing around some ideas for new material. The remainder of their year will be spent playing shows and writing new songs.

Nuns and gamblers alike graced Chosky Theater this weekend in the School of Music’s production of Sacred and Profane. Appropriately named, this production featured two one-act operas: Giacomo Puccini’s Suor Angelica, which depicts a nun with a questionable past living in a 17th-century convent, and Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht’s Mahagonny-Songspiel, the story of six characters who attempt to find happiness by creating a society shaped by their carefree desires.
In Puccini’s opera, graduate vocal performance student Nicole Marie Gasse sang the part of Sister Angelica, a nun who gives birth to an illegitimate son before joining a convent. The plot thickens when her aunt, a princess played by senior voice major Gillian Hassert, visits the convent to speak with Angelica regarding distribution of the family fortune. Gasse and Hassert stole the show on opening night. Hassert’s character is intended to be powerful and intimidating on stage, and her overall performance and presence certainly matched Puccini’s intentions. Gasse’s voice was chill-inducing in Angelica’s final aria, which did not disappoint as the first opera came to a close.
After intermission, the audience returned to a society of common and comparatively vulgar characters in Mahagonny-Songspiel. Originally intended to be a full-length opera, the production features a libretto by Bertolt Brecht. Brecht strives to draw the audience’s focus to his critical perspective of human nature by intentionally leaving much of the plot and character development up to the director’s interpretation. Thus, Weill’s music and the fact that there are six major characters are often the only consistencies from production to production.
One of the liberties taken in this particular production was the director’s choice to add a narrator, played by senior voice major Piers Portfolio on opening night. The narrator begins the opera by introducing the six characters with a short monologue. Each of the characters are attempting to get to the city of Mahagonny, where residents are free to do as they please. As the plot unfolds, the characters come to the realization that happiness and desires should not be sought after so thoughtlessly.
The narrator tied the plot together and helped shed some light on the opera’s character development for the audience. Portfolio gave an entertaining performance, demanding the audience’s attention from the beginning and acting as the bridge between the audience and the characters on stage.
Mahagonny-Songspiel also featured the talents of senior voice majors Caitlan Pitts, Katherine Brandt, Sean Pack, Martin Schreiner, Tyler Alderson, and Jesse Soracco, all of whom gave strong performances in this thought-provoking opera.
In addition to the individual performances, the production quality of both operas was impressive. The set design was effective and aesthetically pleasing without being distracting or overdone. Blocking for the chorus in the Puccini opera was creative and impressive, especially considering the size of the cast. Lighting for Suor Angelica was well done, including a slight tilt of a suspended window frame to affect the direction of the light coming from backstage. Overall, Sacred and Profane was a fantastic show from the School of Music, setting high expectations for future productions.

“Music is Alive: The Fourth Annual A CaPittsburgh Project,” a charity concert put on every year by Carnegie Mellon’s a cappella groups, was held in Rangos Hall this past Saturday, featuring performances by Counterpoint, Treblemakers, Soundbytes, The Originals, Joyful Noise, and Deewane. The event raises funds for music-related programs in the Pittsburgh area each year. Proceeds of this year’s A CaPittsburgh will benefit the Tickets for Kids Foundation, which provides opportunities for underprivileged children to experience cultural activities and events in the area.
Counterpoint, Carnegie Mellon’s only all-women a cappella group, hosts the event each year. The group kicked off the night with a dreamy rendition of the well-known pop song “Mr. Sandman.” The group performed with solid harmonies and cute choreography, starting the show off on the right foot.   Treblemakers, the newest co-ed group on campus and one of the largest groups of the night, performed next. Their best song was an energetic and passionate rendition of “Breakeven” by The Script with an excellent solo performance.
The next two groups, Soundbytes and The Originals, definitely stole the show. Soundbytes, a co-ed group that writes its own arrangements, was engaging and energetic throughout its performance. The group closed its set with “Roxanne” by The Police, featuring an outstanding solo performance and the most energy displayed by any group all night.
The Originals, one of Carnegie Mellon’s all-male groups, kept the energy up with their set, displaying loads of personality and enthusiasm. They sang about heartbreak and failed relationships, successfully winning over the hearts of the audience. They closed their performance with Queen’s “Somebody to Love”; when the soloist was standing there begging the audience for someone to love, it was hard to imagine he’d be alone for long.
After a short intermission, the event continued with Joyful Noise, a Christian co-ed group, and Deewane, a South Asian male group. Joyful Noise introduced each song individually, which caused its performance to drag despite its strong vocals and made some audience members uncomfortable. Deewane, which is Hindi for “madly in love,” put on an engaging show with plenty of choreography. The group’s unique mixture of modern and traditional music and dance was extremely entertaining, and the audience seemed to love every minute of it. Deewane put on a high-energy performance and closed with a great dance number that included small lifting stunts.
Counterpoint closed out the night with nice renditions of “I Follow Rivers” by Lykke Li, “God Only Knows” by The Beach Boys, and “Like a Prayer” by Madonna. All three of these songs featured clean harmonies and were well received by the audience.
Overall, the event was very successful and attendance was high. Every seat in Rangos was filled, and many people had to sit or stand around the edges and back of the room. A mixture of students, parents, and alumni, the audience was energetic and thoroughly enjoyed the show. After hearing all six of the a cappella groups, it’s easy to understand why A CaPittsburgh is such a big event each year, showcasing the talent of Carnegie Mellon’s a cappella groups and raising money for a good cause.

Senior directing major Christian Fleming brilliantly adapted Urinetown: The Musical, a Tony award-winning play by Mark Holman and Greg Kotis, in a production put on by Scotch’n’Soda Theatre over Cèilidh Weekend.
The story is simple. In what seems to be a rapidly deteriorating society, a drought has been going on for decades; as a means of controlling water consumption, toilet use has been privatized. The play depicts the struggle of a segment of a small town overrun with residents who cannot afford to pay to use the amenities of the Urine Good Company.
The production was short of neither puns, nor great comedic timing, true commitment to character, and wonderful technical executions.
Many people can attest to Scotch’n’Soda’s legacy of showcasing top-notch performances. On opening night, a student from Chatham University had a lot to say during the intermission. “This show is new to me. It’s fantastic! Everyone is so funny and talented and I love the political satire,” said Lindy McQuinn, a graduate student in counseling psychology. “Who doesn’t love a little political satire in this time?”
Some of the best aspects of the production were the copious references made to several other musicals including Annie, The Wizard of Oz, The Lion King, A Christmas Carol, and You’re A Good Man, Charlie Brown. The cast mimicked many of the characters from these well-known productions. For instance, the character Hot Harry Blades, played by first-year CIT student Canute Haroldson, is meant to be a reference to Sweeney Todd in that he wore a blood-red shirt with a black leather vest and wielded a shaving razor.
Scotch’n’Soda’s adaptation emphasized these references even further. “Much of the references were cranked up, such as with The Lion King,” said Matt Zurcher, a junior in the Bachelor of Humanities and Arts program for musicology and film studies who was the assistant director for the Scotch’n’Soda performance. 
Hope Cladwell, one of the major characters, was played by first-year psychology major Jaclyn Ross, who had a heartwarming voice that filled the room with hope that the people of Urinetown would be fine in the end. “I am already getting sad that the show will be over soon,” Ross said after the opening-night performance.
“It was a lot of work to create something really great. I appreciated what Chris brought to it,” said James Alexander, a sophomore vocal major who magnificently played Caldwell B. Cladwell, after the show.
Every song and dance number was executed with tremendous energy that nearly propelled the audience to stand up and dance along with the cast. The numbers were enhanced by the contributions of the stage lighting and a live band, conducted by junior music major Corey Wachala. One clever aspect of this performance was the several references to “the most expensive university in the world,” after which the cast would snap their heads toward the audience and snap them back on stage.
On the small stage, a tall wooden platform and impressive structure were erected for the production. The stage was cleverly designed to resemble a toilet. There was a flush handle and float ball that made the image complete, although it did take a bit of studying the structure to figure out what it was supposed to resemble.
There was an incredible amount of work put into this performance, and it showed. Scotch’n’Soda did a fantastic job with this production and lived up to the reputation the group has as a talented and passionate organization.

This past Friday night, Carnegie Mellon students displayed a wide array of individual and group talent in the Cèilidh Student Showcase. The showcase featured students from every college at Carnegie Mellon and a diversity of performances in dance, song, and creative writing.
The showcase mainly drew an audience of parents; they sat at round tables in Rangos Hall decorated with floral arrangements and cookie platters, giving the event a more formal setting. The interesting choice of background music projected a techno-like vibe that seemed a bit out of place, given the surroundings.
Directed by master of ceremonies and sophomore drama student Jordan Phillips, the program began with an a cappella collaboration with members from different a cappella groups on campus performing Adele’s “Rolling in the Deep” with an enthusiastic yet professional attitude.
Other than the a cappella performance, the program placed a heavy emphasis on dance, with dance troupes making up five of the showcase’s six group performances. Far from being repetitive, each of these dance performances offered a different perspective and made a unique contribution to the showcase. The groups were culturally diverse — from South Asian to Afro-Brazilian to co-ed fusion — and brought a variety of cultural voices to the occasion. Tanah, a South Asian dance troupe, and Tufaan—The Storm, a co-ed fusion dance team, danced with energy and enthusiasm; members of the Capoeira Club performed a captivating cross between martial arts and dance. The members of Bhangra gave their typically stunning and well-rehearsed performance, while students from Dancers’ Symposium ended the program with a vibrant and mesmerizing modern dance piece.
Scattered between the group performances were individual pieces that balanced out the program nicely. Sophomore drama student Alesia Etinoff offered a refreshingly blunt perspective on the relationship between clothes and identity in her piece, “Clothes Do Not Define Me.” Phillips left the podium and joined sophomore drama student Tsilala Graham-Haynes in silently acting out the piece as it was read, giving the words an important and well-choreographed visual dimension. Etinoff’s frank and unflinching tone left a striking impact on her audience as she said bluntly, “Clothes get more compliments than we do.”
Individual performances continued to impress throughout the program. On violin, junior music major Christine Hedden’s Irish fiddle tunes were a beautiful and unexpected salute to the cèilidh tradition. By alluding to her experiences growing up with these tunes, Hedden also gave the performance a personal touch. Steven Robertson, a first-year drama student on voice and guitar, and Peter Marchetti, a sophomore math major on piano, both graced the stage with their instrumental performances. Senior drama student Stefan Dezil gave a passionate vocal performance of “A Change is Gonna Come” from Uptown Boys, pairing a great voice with contagious energy.
On Chinese yo-yo, first-year H&SS student Mallory Wang showed obvious grace and skill — an impression that was heightened by her choice of epic background music.
Perhaps the most impressive facet of the showcase was the fact that the vast majority of the student performers had majors outside of music or dance. These students hailed from every college in the university: Engineering students sang a cappella, while science and humanities students performed in dance. In this way, the student showcase lived up to its name, demonstrating the raw talent of Carnegie Mellon students regardless of their studies.
The showcase succeeded in bringing a diverse taste of student life to the limelight. Not only did the program draw from a variety of cultural backgrounds, but it also created a nice balance between individual and group performances. Overall, it stayed true to Cèilidh Weekend’s label as an international festival and showed off what the event would have to offer over the next two days.

One of the most well-known holidays of the year, Halloween engages those who celebrate it with costumes and copious quantities of teeth-rotting candy. In addition, Halloween baked treats both taste great and are fun to make. You'll be surprised by how simple it is to make these spooky treats and how much fun you have along the way.
Frankenstein Crispy Treats (Frankentreats)
This is probably the easiest and most adorable of the treats. Melt the stick of butter and the entire bag of marshmallows in a large pot, and put in as much or as little green food coloring as you want. Once the mixture has melted, mix in about 6 cups of cereal. Then lay out the mixture on a flat tray or pan, and put it in the fridge to cool for an hour or two.
When cool, take the tray out and cut the large block into squares. Cut off one small corner from the clear plastic bag and spoon the chocolate frosting into the bag. By squeezing frosting through this makeshift pastry bag, you can now decorate each square into a Frankenstein face. Draw in some hair, eyes, and some stitches over a cut. Simple and adorable.
Spider Cupcakes
Bake the cupcakes like you normally would and frost them with chocolate frosting. Use your assorted candy — which can include candy corn, M&M’s, Reese’s Pieces, or chocolate chips — to create a face by using them to represent nose and eyes for your spider. Then, using the pretzel sticks, stick them into the sides of the cupcake to act as the spider's legs.
“Coughed-Up Blood” Brownies
This creation is simple, as are the other two. Prepare the brownie batter as per usual. Once you are ready to put it into the oven, throw in some M&M’s or Reese’s Pieces. Once the brownies have cooled down and have been cut into pieces, melt the peanut butter chips in a small pan. After they have melted, mix in red food coloring until you get the desired color. Drizzle the “blood” over the brownies in a very sloppy way. Now they should look like they were coughed on by a slasher flick victim. Mission accomplished.
Old-Fashioned Halloween Sugar Cookies
You can easily bake some sugar cookies and make them into spooky characters by piping frosting through a tiny hole cut out from the corner of a plastic bag. Making a pumpkin is simple, as is making a spooky ghost. Just find a simple picture of some basic spooky characters online if you are unsure about your artistic abilities.

It’s Halloween. The one and only holiday where you can wear a ridiculous costume in public has finally arrived.
If midterms bogged you down and left you without time to shop or create a costume, then no worries. Below are a bunch of costume ideas that are both inexpensive — college students are perpetually on a budget, after all — and relatively quick to make.
Baby: Becoming a creepy adult-baby is simple. Find a friend who can lend you some blush for your cheeks. For girls and guys with long hair, it would be a downright shame not to take advantage and make some pigtails. 
* Teddy bear
* Pajamas
* Ability to throw random tantrums
* Makeup
Zombie: Throw on some tattered clothes and borrow some makeup from a friend. Use some foundation and some red lipstick to create some oozing wounds. Dark eyeliner will also go a long way.
* Makeup
* Tattered clothing
* Moaning abilities
Bag of Jelly Beans: Wear a white shirt. Find some construction paper and cut out several kidney-shaped pieces in a variety of colors (or just in your favorite). Grab a large clear plastic bag and cut out holes for your head, arms, and legs. Now put the bag on over the cutouts that you have taped to your shirt. Make a sandwich board using cardboard, and use some ribbon to tie it around you. This will be a great conversation starter. You will be able to ask people to if they want some of your goodies.
* Construction paper
* Large clear plastic bag
* Cardboard
* Ribbon
Glee’s Sue Sylvester: Put on a track suit. Accessorize with a whistle and a snarky attitude. If you can surround yourself with a medley of people who represent different cultures and a variety of people who happen to be able to sing, you get a gold star. Not sure from where, but you’ll get one.
* Sweat suit
* Whistle
* Bad attitude
Old Spice Guy (guys only): Grab a towel and wrap it around yourself — you might want to wear some shorts underneath, though. Borrow a bottle of Old Spice body wash from someone on your floor if you don’t already own some. 
* Old Spice body wash
* Towel (preferably yellow)
* Flirtatious, charming personality
Ghost: Easy as pie. Like shooting fish in a barrel. Like a knife through butter. This clichéd yet classic Halloween costume is a great way to be festive and adorable. Just take some sheets (your roommate won’t miss them) and cut a couple of holes in them.
* White sheets
* Ability to utter “Boo” from time to time

The Arctic Monkeys made their second appearance in Pittsburgh on Oct. 18 at Stage AE, coming off the release of their latest album, Suck It and See. When this album came out in June, it was clear that the band was departing from the experimental style of its third album, Humbug, but not exactly returning to the form of the group’s first two albums. Both the newly developed style and confidence were obvious during the performance.
The Smith Westerns opened the concert, playing some of their more popular tracks, such as “Weekends.” While they were very enjoyable for an opening band, excitement was clearly building for the Arctic Monkeys’ performance. Going straight into “Don’t Sit Down ’Cause I’ve Moved Your Chair,” the Arctic Monkeys built the atmosphere quickly for the high-energy show.
The band was able to balance playing songs from all four of its albums, leaning only slightly toward newer material. By the third song, “Crying Lightning,” the liveliness of the crowd had increased dramatically, continuing over less energetic tracks like “She’s Thunderstorms.” The show reached a peak when the band performed “Still Take You Home” off its first album, Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not.
The performance suffered slightly when the band played “Evil Twin,” an unreleased track that will most likely come out as a B-side to “Suck It and See.” This dip in energy, due only to the crowd’s unfamiliarity with the song, was brief. The excitement returned as drummer Matt Helders began to sing “Brick By Brick,” an upbeat song that hearkens to many different eras of rock and roll.
The audience was fully invigorated when the band performed “When The Sun Goes Down.” During the encore, the fan favorite “Fluorescent Adolescent” kept fans singing along with the lyrics. The Arctic Monkeys closed the show with “505,” as they did when they played at Mr. Small’s Theatre in 2009. This performance had a heavy mood throughout the verses and an intense fervor during the chorus, creating an excellent ending to the show.
The most noticeable aspects of the show were the atmosphere of the venue and the confidence of the band. Stage AE loses much of the ambiance of the more intimate Mr. Small’s Theatre, yet the high-energy set list created a greater level of excitement than the group’s first Pittsburgh show, which focused mainly on its psychedelic rock-influenced material from Humbug.
The Arctic Monkeys have obviously grown as a band; lead singer and guitarist Alex Turner in particular was channeling something of a James Dean swagger and maintained a strong repartee with the crowd. The band is growing up, both in its musical style and its stage persona. The Arctic Monkeys are no longer just a few teenagers from Sheffield who bang out some riffs laden with distortion. They are now true performers, combining their original spirit with a more mature sound to put on an exhilarating show.

Dear Patrick,
My girlfriend is visiting me for the weekend, and I’m really excited to see her. I haven’t seen her for a couple months. However, I just got the new Batman game, and I was really looking forward to playing it all weekend. But if I play it, I’ll ignore her. What should I do?
Thanks,
Girlfriend Always Monopolizing Entertainment, Ordering Romance, Distracting Amazing Multimedia Experiences
Dear GAME OR DAME,
Whenever I have a question like this — or any question, really — I think to myself, “What would Batman do?” And Batman tells me the virtual citizens of Gotham can’t save themselves. I’ve played the new Batman game, and it’s really awesome. You get to be Batman! Of course, Batman lives with a young boy in a Speedo and an old man, so you probably shouldn’t take his love advice.
As awesome as Batman is, though, you should probably spend time with your girlfriend. You don’t see her often, and I’m sure there are many things she’d prefer to do other than watch you play Batman — like play Batman herself. If she wants to spend the weekend playing Batman, then you’d better hold on to that girl. You hold her tight and never let go.
I’ll take any excuse to talk about Batman,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I’m not very good at flirting. The only times I’ve gone out with girls have been after they’ve actually thrown themselves at me. When I try to flirt with a girl, I either can’t think of anything to say or wind up arguing with her. Do you have any tips?
Thanks,
Frankly, Intimidating Remarks Start The Majority Of Verbal Exchanges, Whether On Romantic Sojourns To Mate or On Vocational Engagements
Dear FIRST MOVE WORST MOVE,
You’ve come to the right place! First, it seems clear that, whenever you open your mouth, you stick your foot in it. Just keep your mouth shut. Instead, develop a brooding personality, like that of a Byronic hero. You want to get away with as little talking as possible.
Suppose you can’t pull off the Byronic look — perhaps you’re blonde and can’t stop smiling. One alternative is “chirping.” Chirping is when you stand in the corner of the room and hold up your hand, opening and closing it as if you had a baby-bird sock puppet on. Then, “chirp” at a girl. As ridiculous as it sounds, it might work. Perhaps chicks dig the “not sure if cute and awkward or serial killer” look.
Or just accept your lonely fate,
Patrick Hoskins

Whenever I talk to a music junkie, one sentiment that almost always comes up is nostalgia. The modern audiophile is mired in his desire to immerse himself in vinyl music. While vinyl does have its merits, people who claim that they “miss the good old days of vinyl” should stop fixating on the past and realize just how awesome the ability to have digitized music is.
The biggest advantages to digital music are mass storage capabilities and portability. Within the past 14 years, MP3 players have been transformed from a novelty with a capacity of 32 MB, or about six songs, to an irreplaceable cultural fixture. They are not only able to hold up to 180 GB, or about 40,000 songs, but they can also be used for watching TV, checking e-mail, or reading books. It’s a shame that our generation is so technologically desensitized, because that achievement is astounding — mind-blowing, even.
But the technological achievements are not the biggest reason why digital music players are awesome. Instead, it is the personal history that they contain. Each MP3 player functions as an autobiography, compiling the music that has come to bookmark every event and person that influences our taste and style. The advent of the MP3 player does not just result in a more convenient method of enjoying music, but also in a more convenient way in which to express our lives to others. Ask to look at another person’s MP3 player and scroll through their handpicked catalog of sound. Who knows what intriguing detail of their life you’ll find? Maybe you’ll discover that the classical cellist major you sit next to in class is also a huge fan of black metal, or that the quiet girl who eats alone has the exact same music taste as you, or even that the music director of a freeform radio station has a not-so-guilty love of Ke$ha.
Vinyl is a great medium for listening to music and should not be forgotten. But at the same time, digitized music makes viable so many possibilities that you would be doing yourself a disservice by dissing MP3s.

The men’s cross country team marks its 80th consecutive win in a dual meet after besting Thiel College at home. Despite many runners having missed races due to illness throughout the season, the Tartans are looking forward to the conference championships — which they’re attempting to win for the seventh time in a row.
10 YEARS AGO -- Oct. 29, 2001
Midterm grades are released with a bonus: the first round of a three-semester pilot on plus/minus grading. Undergraduates, surprised by the change, aren’t fans of it. With Carnegie Mellon’s academic stress at a plus, they say, extra emphasis on letter grades is a big minus.
FIVE YEARS AGO -- Oct. 30, 2006
In honor of the newspaper’s centenary, The Tartan’s front page is given over to a dramatic photo of a 100-candle birthday cake. Inside, an article describes life at the paper through the ages, from dealing with typesetters and wax machines to running a fake restaurant review and almost getting expelled.
ONE YEAR AGO -- Oct. 25, 2010
Halloween-themed events happening around the city this week include imitations of dead entertainers (“Night of the Singing Dead”), a radio production of Orson Welles’ War of the Worlds, and a ghost tour of Mount Washington. With Oct. 31 falling on a Sunday, The Tartan urges readers to try trick-or-treating through the dorms.

The Spring Carnival Committee announced the 2012 Carnival theme, As Seen On TV, at the Tartans’ Cèilidh Weekend football game last Saturday.
In addition to the announcement of the theme, the logo design for this year’s Carnival was revealed to be a television with legs wearing a kilt and a Tam o’ Shanter — a Scottish hat — with various tools and construction equipment seemingly coming out of its screen.
Other preparations for the April event are also in the works. Spring Carnival Committee chair and information systems master’s student Meg Hayes said that last year’s fireworks show was lackluster, due to safety concerns requiring the Spring Carnival Committee to use indoor-grade fireworks.
“One of the things we’re working on is finding a location that we can shoot off fireworks from that will make it a good show again,” she said.
On the alumni side, Dan Barnett, the director of on-campus programs in the Office of Alumni Relations, said that his department has begun reaching out to alumni from the years that will hold reunions this year, as well as to alumni special-interest groups that may want to hold events.
Meanwhile, according to Hayes, Spring Carnival Committee has begun lining up the logistical contracts needed for Midway, such as those for tents.
“The fall is definitely about laying the groundwork for Carnival,” Hayes said. She remarked that many people believe that Carnival planning starts in February, but even now the Spring Carnival Committee is busy planning Carnival budgeting, publicity, and entertainment.
One aspect that is taking up a lot of the committee’s time, Hayes said, is the Booth construction standards. 
“Last year, [construction] caused a lot of headaches for different organizations because it was a new set of standards,” Hayes explained. “It was a lot stricter than it’s been in past years, and so we are planning on adding a lot of education around those standards so that there aren’t the issues that there were last year, and so that Booth organizations can be more successful.”
According to The Piper, the new Booth construction codes are based on the International Building Code.
Barnett, meanwhile, hopes that Carnival will see more graduate student involvement this year, something he said has been difficult in the past due to scheduling differences in the Heinz College and the Tepper School of Business.
“We’re really excited to continue to amp up our programming,” Barnett said.

As the temperatures dropped and the sun set, alumni, faculty, and current students donned formal attire for the annual Alumni Awards ceremony.
In his opening remarks, University President Jared Cohon said that the Alumni Awards have “grown to be a highlight of the year for the university.”
Rangos Hall was transformed into an awards venue, illuminated with colored spotlights and lighted podiums. The podiums on stage were bookended by two Jumbotron-style screens displaying video of the events at hand.
The first 30 minutes of the program were devoted to allowing guests and attendees mingle and chat about their respective experiences at Carnegie Mellon.
A jazz ensemble from the music department, coupled with lighting provided by the drama department, created an ambience that led many, such as visiting parent Barbara Hois, to be “impressed with its elegance.”
At 5:30 p.m., the lights dimmed and this year’s honorees were escorted into the ballroom by a bagpiper, signaling the ceremony’s beginning.
After a video highlighting some of Carnegie Mellon’s notable alumni, the stage lights were raised for opening remarks by Andrew Shaindlin, the associate vice president for Alumni Relations and Annual Giving. MC Beverly Wheeler then took the stage to introduce Cohon and the awards themselves. 
Founded in 1950, the Alumni Awards were created to acknowledge “exceptional Carnegie Mellon alumni and students for their contributions to the university, their communities, and their professions,” Cohon said in his opening remarks.
Initially, the program only contained Alumni Service and “Achievement” categories, but it has since added the “Distinguished” categories starting in the 1960s, Student Service recognition in 1992, the Recent Alumni Award in 2002, and — most recently — the Faculty Service Award in 2006.
As Shaindlin explained via email, the Alumni Awards ceremonies were once private only to the honorees, invited guests, nominators, and administrative officials. However, the presentation was later reworked as an open ceremony with a private reception, and the event became completely public in 2008. 
The first award presented was the Student Service Award, given to current Carnegie Mellon students engaged in giving back to the campus and to the community.
Recipients of this award were Suraj Baxi, a senior social and decision sciences major; Maricel Paz, a senior psychology major; and Erica Spiritos, a senior civil and environmental engineering major who is spending the semester in Israel and who presented her acceptance speech via pre-recorded video.
Two Recent Alumni Awards were given to individuals who attained “exceptional achievement” within 10 years of their Carnegie Mellon graduation. The recipients of this award were Elizabeth Higgins Durika (E ’03) and Keith Eich (E ’02).
Durika, a Navy lieutenant who attended the university on an ROTC scholarship, recalled Carnegie Mellon as “the best-fit school for me.” She also commented on the elegance of the ceremony, referring to it as “a class act.”
Nikhil Balram (E ’86, ’88, ’92), Daniel Fawcett (TPR ’88), Paul Jacob III (A ’71), Rajeev Mehta (TPR ’92), and Neil Spisak (A ’78) won the Alumni Achievement Awards for leadership and innovations in their respective fields. 
Next were the Alumni Service awards, given to Teresa Allison (HNZ ’99), Myron Lewis (S ’54), Timothy Liu (HS ’85), and Christine Hayes Nolin (S ’85) for their service and commitment to Carnegie Mellon and related alumni programs after graduation.
The final awards presented Friday evening were the Alumni Distinguished Achievement Awards, given to three-time Grammy-winning French horn virtuoso and conductor Dale Clevenger (A ’62) and medical researcher Hillard M. Lazarus (E ’70), who performed the world’s first adult stem cell transplant.
Upon accepting the award, Lazarus complimented the “wonderful culture and contributions” of the university, while Clevenger shared the emotional experience he had upon re-entering the College of Fine Arts building the morning prior.
Cohon drew the ceremony to a close, and the attendees headed to a reception in CFA’s Great Hall. In his closing speech, Cohon reflected on the ceremony and called the Alumni Awards “a powerful reminder of what this university is about.”

The Carnegie Mellon research group TechBridgeWorld held its annual interactive event in the Newell-Simon Hall atrium last Wednesday. 
This year’s theme was “TechCaFE: Making Learning Fun.” The TechCaFE project, short for Technology for Customizable and Fun Education, offers tools for teaching and practicing English literacy. The four essential tools of TechCaFE — called CaFE Teach, CaFE Web, CaFE Phone, and CaFE Play — were all on display on Wednesday.
M. Bernardine Dias, an assistant research professor in the Robotics Institute, founded TechBridgeWorld in 2004 with the hope of implementing technological solutions that promote sustainable innovations in developing countries. 
TechCaFE, which was initiated five years ago, has been one of the most successful projects TechBridgeWorld has done so far, Dias said.
Using TechCaFE tools, Dias explained, a student can link English grammar exercises to games on his or her phone. The games are developed by TechCaFE’s CaFE Play team, while the exercises are created online by teachers through CaFE Teach. Students are able to download questions for each new class.
“The biggest feature of TechCaFE was its high-level customization,” Dias said. “We try to customize it on different levels. The first thing is that we want the concept of the game and the content to be separated. That’s one of our key innovations.” 
Teachers using TechCaFE have the power to customize their own exercises and create their own content through the games. In addition, TechCaFE can be customized through close partnership with local communities.
“We worked very closely to communities,” Dias said as she explained the project’s beginnings, and how it has evolved over the years. “It’s not like we sit in the lab and think ‘What shall we build next?’ There is always a partner, a partner in the community, that wants us to do something. When we first started, we begged people, asked them about their difficulties. So for the first year and a half, we had to work very hard. But now I get way too many requests, and we sometimes have to say no. It’s kind of sad that we can’t do everything.”
TechCaFE has been put into use in many places, including Tanzania, Somalia, Uruguay, India, Qatar, and the United States.
Jayce Maravich, a teacher from the Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf, attended the event on Wednesday. Her school began to use the CaFE Phone, a mobile phone game created by the project, two years ago. Maravich said that the tool was very helpful and that the school got a lot of positive feedback from the students. As a teacher, she used CaFE Teach to create questions online that students could download to their phones.
“It is very easy to use and very flexible,” she remarked.
TechCaFE not only has an impact on local communities, but it also influences the Carnegie Mellon students who become involved in the project.
Hatem Alismail, a Ph.D. student in the Robotics Institute, said, “It made me realize the importance of people, the importance of listening to what they want and what they need — listening to their feedback and encouraging them to contribute to the development.”
Students who attended the interactive event had positive reflections.
“I read the descriptions online and I thought [the event] would be all about robots or computers or machines. I was surprised to find here it was all everyday technology,” said University of Pittsburgh media and professional communications major Hebah Elmasri. “It has so much information here. I really appreciate the theme of CaFE to make learning fun.”
TechCaFE is still a research project, and it is free for public use. Dias said that her goal is to make the project as accessible as possible.
“We could go with some open-source license,” she said. “We are not planning to make money out of it, but the best way to get it to the largest number of people might be to let someone else to make money. So I haven’t fully decided yet, but from our purpose it’s free.”

Ta-Nehisi Coates, a senior editor for The Atlantic, spoke at Carnegie Mellon last Wednesday about the importance of poetry in writing.
Coates spoke as part of the English department’s Adamson Awards Speakers series. The Adamson series draws speakers from many areas of writing; Coates is this year’s non-fiction speaker.
English professor Yona Harvey, who said she has known Coates since he was 19, delivered the introduction to the lecture.
“I think he really captures what Carnegie Mellon tries to promote, which is this idea of being interdisciplinary and multitasking,” Harvey said. “He’s a senior editor at The Atlantic, which is this huge and important magazine, but he also blogs for The Atlantic; he uses Twitter in a really smart way; he’s written a traditional memoir; he’s working on a novel.”
Sarah Deiuliis, a junior psychology and English double major who attended the lecture, agreed with Harvey’s statement.
“It’s interesting that he’s so versatile,” she said. “It just seems like he can do anything.”
At the lecture, Coates performed four readings from his novel, which tells the story of an interracial family in pre-Civil War Virginia through the viewpoints of four members of the family: two white members and two black members, two of whom are men and two of whom are women.
Coates referred to the four narrators as four “voices” and said that he worked — and continues to work — to make them authentic but distinctive. As part of his research, Coates read extensively from primary sources of the era, but he said that he did not stick religiously to the language that he found in them. For example, he mixed occasional modern words into the pre-Civil War speech of his characters.
“I’m very firm in the idea that history is dead,” Coates said. “It’s over, it’s happened, there’s no time machine to go back, so really all that’s left is your imagination. So I want to be grounded in this stuff, but I don’t want to be stuck there. This is not what slavery was like in Virginia. It shows that a page is not a person.”
According to Harvey, Coates is “a poet at heart.” Coates said that he believes that all writers should study poetry.
“The whole notion among poets that sentences should be brought under heavy pressure, every word should count, language should be rich, is something that really doesn’t exist in journalism. But I really think it should.” He used Twitter as an example: Every once in a while, Coates said, because of the restrictive character limit, someone comes up with a truly beautiful tweet.
Many of the students who came to the lecture heard about Coates through his memoir, The Beautiful Struggle.
“He’s had a really interesting life,” said Magdalen Silberman, a junior creative writing major who read some of Coates’ memoir for a class. “It made me want to go look at his blog for sure.” Silberman said that it was fascinating to hear parts of a novel in progress.
Coates, for his part, said that although he rarely gives lectures, this one was a success. “It was useful to talk to students,” he said about his unfinished novel.
As for what’s next, Coates said that he has no idea and wouldn’t want to know: “Change is natural.” Whatever catches his interest next, Coates said, he wants to be surprised by it.

Pausch Bridge light shows designed by students, dean
The Randy Pausch Memorial Bridge showcased student-developed lighting designs, as well as a light show by School of Computer Science Dean Randal E. Bryant, last Thursday as part of Cèilidh Weekend.
The four student teams’ light shows will continue to be exhibited on the bridge for many months. 
Each student designed their shows with a different theme: “Fusion,” “A Day in the Life,” “Twitterbridge,” and “Time in Motion.”
The shows were created for a class on interactive expression and programming that was taught for the first time this semester by Cindy Limauro, a professor of lighting design in the School of Drama; Christopher Werner, an adjunct instructor of lighting design; and Eric Paulos, an associate professor in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute.
“The student shows embody the spirit of Randy Pausch in exploring unknown territory, taking risks, and creating a dynamic experience for the campus community,” Limauro said in a university press release.
In addition to the four student-designed Bridge lights, Bryant designed a show called “One Sort or Another,” a visual exploration of sorting algorithms. 
He used rectangles of different colors to represent items of different value, and his light show displays the effect of rearranging the items to put them in order. Bryant designed his show to use various sorting methods and different ways of partitioning the bridge lights into rectangles to generate thousands of sequences.
Washburn to participate in engineering symposium
Newell R. Washburn has been invited to attend the Frontiers of Engineering Education Symposium hosted by the National Academy of Engineering. 
Washburn is a Carnegie Mellon assistant professor in the departments of chemistry, materials science and engineering, and biomedical engineering.
The symposium will take place in Irvine, Calif., Nov. 13–16, and over 60 engineering researchers and educators plan to attend. According to a Carnegie Mellon press release, the program will focus on “teaching, project-based learning, active and self-directed learning, assessment of student learning, and innovation in education.”
“This is a wonderful opportunity and a great way to network with some of my research colleagues nationwide,” Washburn said in the press release. Washburn also hopes that engineering and science students will become interested in applying what they are learning in the classroom to the real world.
Edward F. Crawley, the chair of the symposium’s planning committee, stressed the importance of today’s engineers addressing the lack of leaders in their field.
The conference comes at a time when the United States is producing many fewer engineers than before. According to the National Academy of Engineering, fewer than 5 percent of bachelor’s degrees awarded in the United States are in an engineering field, compared to 44 percent in China.

Design Lecture: Nervous System: “Growing Objects”
Tuesday at 5 p.m.
Breed Hall (Margaret Morrison 103)
Nervous System is a design studio whose members work at the intersection of science, art, and technology. Founded by Jessica Rosenkrantz and Jesse Louris-Rosenberg in 2007, Nervous System creates computer programs to create what the group describes on its website as “unique and affordable” consumer products. In the lecture, Rosenkrantz and Louris-Rosenberg will discuss their design philosophy, explaining why they have decided to create objects through software instead of through more traditional methods.
This lecture is sponsored through a partnership between the School of Design, the Studio for Creative Inquiry, and the D-Fab Lab.
Media, Meaning and Computation: Expressive Intelligence and the Future of Playable Media
Wednesday at 4:30 p.m.
Rashid Auditorium (Hillman Center 4401)
Moving on from performance artist Stelarc and his grafted-on third ear, the HCII Seminar’s new Z-Axis series continues with Michael Mateas, co-director of the Center for Games and Playable Media at the University of California, Santa Cruz. His talk, as explained in its abstract, will explore the “explosion of interest, both inside and outside academia, in games,” as Mateas argues that research should work to expand the possiblities for game-based media.
Conversation with Dr. Vandana Shiva
Thursday at 12:30 p.m.
Connan Room, University Center
Dr. Vandana Shiva is an activist against bioengineering companies, including Monsanto, that genetically engineer their own crops and pesticides, causing “superweeds” to develop and thrive.
An ardent ecofeminist, Shiva believes women should more strongly defend their historical role, which she calls “the providers of food security,” by supporting and promoting biological diversity in the crops that are planted both in America and around the world. Shiva believes such action is necessary to circumvent a small number of companies that create and control the global food supply.
This lecture is sponsored by the Center for History and Policy, the Office of the Vice Provost for Education, Student Affairs, and the Steinbrenner Institute.

Cèilidh Weekend made its debut this past Thursday through Sunday, cheerfully advertised as a new Carnegie Mellon tradition. Although we’re not totally convinced the organizers behind the event managed to reach their audience as well as they intended to, they should be congratulated for bringing together three very different existing traditions: Homecoming, International Festival, and Family Weekend. 
In the past, these three events were held at a similar time of year but on different weekends. Now that they’ve been united under one banner, hopefully we’ll see an increase in overall attendance, as well as the formation of a new and interesting tradition for the school. In addition, Cèilidh seems to be marketing itself as a bridge between traditionally alumni-focused events and those aimed at students — an important connection to form for the future.
That said, the advertising and organization of Cèilidh Weekend could have used a serious face-lift. In theory, the Cèilidh organizers — principally the offices of Alumni Relations, International Education, and Orientation and First-Year Programs — attempted to reach their audience via social networking. However, with a grand total at the time of publishing of 55 “likes” on Facebook and 41 followers on Twitter (many of which appear to be student organization Twitter accounts), the event’s publicity was sub-par at best.
Had the organizers created individual Facebook events for each university-sponsored event, the attendance might have been stronger and word of mouth might have been more effective. Additionally, although there were many student-created events clearly designated as more or less Cèilidh connected, none but Scotch’n’Soda’s production of Urinetown had the name “Cèilidh” visible in its event description. 
With the exception of a few fliers and a banner on the Alumni House, little was done offline to promote Cèilidh to current students. Instead of seeming like a cohesive tradition, Cèilidh seemed more a scattered offering of interesting diversions that happened to fall on the same weekend.
We support Carnegie Mellon’s initiative in creating Cèilidh Weekend and would like to see it flourish. For that reason, we suggest branding it as a fall version of Carnival. By pushing student-run events to the forefront of Cèilidh Weekend, Alumni Relations and the Student Cèilidh Weekend Committee are already halfway there; the promotion, on the other hand, needs to play catch-up.
To easily accomplish this goal, the organizers would do well to learn from Carnival’s success. Aligning the festival with Mid-Semester Break, for instance, would give students a day off to enjoy Cèilidh’s events, much like the two days off for Carnival in the spring. This celebration is a large and valuable thing; by playing it up as more than just an average weekend, the university community has a lot of power to foster something excellent.
What Cèilidh ultimately needs is a metaphorical megaphone, an easier way to reach the student body. By moving more toward a weekend-long party intended to catch students’ eyes and away from a “parents’ night” or alumni weekend feel, we’ll see Cèilidh established as something that will persist for decades to come. Because ultimately, given Carnegie Mellon’s hard-working atmosphere, that’s what differentiates between traditions that survive and ones that wither: relevancy, interest, and visibility.
Editor’s note: Maricel Paz is chair of the Student Cèilidh Weekend Committee and the online editor for The Tartan.

Recently, producer Lisa Simeone was fired from her position on the staff of Soundprint, a journalistic program which broadcasts to about 35 different NPR stations.
The reason behind the firing? According to independent distributor Soundprint Media, Simeone violated Soundprint’s code of ethics — which was adopted from NPR’s own code of ethics. 
Simeone held a leadership role in a group called October 2011, which aims to promote a political agenda similar to that of Occupy Wall Street. NPR’s ethics code explicitly prohibits journalists from participating in politics, running for office, or participating in marches and rallies that NPR covers. 
Simeone wasn’t fired from World of Opera, another NPR-affiliated show that she hosts — according to NPR Ombudsman Edward Schumacher-Matos, Simeone “has no influence or role in NPR news” and is not an NPR employee. Yet she was fired from a documentary show that NPR airs because the president of Soundprint, Moira Rankin, believed Simeone’s political involvement would compromise her work.
Certainly we agree that it is a conflict of interest for a journalist to actively participate in, say, a protest that she is covering. But barring any participation by any employee in anything NPR covers is excessive. As long as journalists refrain from reporting on issues they are deeply involved in, expressing personal views and participating in issues should not be a problem. 
While journalistic impartiality is an important part of any publication or news source, it’s also important to remember that journalists are human, too. We journalists are not wholly neutral beings; we each come with our own set of biases, perceptions, and views about the world around us. Deny such biases does not mean that they do not exist. While journalists should restrain these biases in their work, that does not mean that they should have to do the same in their private lives. 
Journalists should of course strive to cover events in an unbiased manner. However, if they choose to participate in political events that do not affect or influence their work, they should not be penalized for it. 
The host of a documentary or classical music broadcast should be able to lead or join an unrelated protest on her own time; if that violates a journalistic code of ethics, then that code is too unforgiving.

In a political discussion with a friend of mine recently, I heard this quote: “I’d honestly rather have issues like gay marriage and abortion addressed than the budget and deficit fixed.”
I was taken aback upon hearing this as, in my opinion, social issues are clearly secondary to the current economic crisis that could drastically affect our nation’s future. 
While it would be nice to have these social issues addressed in the coming election, they should clearly take a back seat to the deficit and budget issues.
This isn’t the first time I’ve heard people say things like the above quote; it seems to reflect a viewpoint that I’m hearing more frequently among moderates. One common viewpoint I seem to hear is, “I’m socially liberal but fiscally conservative.” Another similar viewpoint I’ve heard is, “I’m definitely socially liberal, but I don’t really know enough about economics to have an opinion.” 
More and more, people are starting to favor policies that are not held by just one party. Moderates in particular are seeing the need to decide which set of issues, economic or social, they deem most important and sacrifice other issues that come second.
I see the upcoming 2012 election as a great opportunity for the Republican Party to reposition itself and cast away its old stigma of antiquated and prejudiced social policies and truly become the party of limited government.
According to Gallup polls, Americans are increasingly in favor of the legalization of homosexual marriages and also abortion rights, especially in cases of rape. The Republican Party is consistently opposed to gay marriage and abortion, and mixed in its support of abortions in cases of rape. 
As a libertarian, I side with the Republican party the majority of the time, but I can’t help but question these policies.
I have yet to hear a convincing argument condemning gay marriage as a detriment to society, and I’ve struggled morally with abortion. However, I’m pro-choice for the same reason that I side with Republicans on most issues: I believe in limited government. Even the arguably most conservative Republican wing, the Tea Party, is in favor of strictly downsizing the power, size, and scope of the federal government. 
Why this political group wants the government to step in and tell people “no” on issues such as abortion and gay marriage is inherently contradictory. If the party truly believed in limited government, it wouldn’t support policies that expand the reach of government into the private issues of everyday Americans. This antiquated social conservatism is what earns the GOP so much criticism from its liberal opponents.
If the Republican candidates, especially presidential candidates, drop their largely unpopular social stances that drive away young people and moderates, they can garner the support of a much broader voter base. 
In this way, Republicans can get a workable majority in both houses of Congress and can pass popular proposals, such as Herman Cain and Rick Perry’s innovative tax reform plans. This would also put the party in the position to effectively repeal and replace the arcane Obamacare and maybe, just maybe, actually pass a budget.
Right now, the first priority for many Americans is to fix the budget. This is a comprehensive issue that will doubtlessly require a bipartisan, populist solution. 
In my opinion, the party most willing and able to immediately fix the budget issue is the Republican Party. If they can leave antiquated and unpopular stances on social issues behind, they have the potential to be a truly populist movement that acts on what the public actually wants.
By being consistent in their loyalty to the founding fathers’ vision of a truly limited government, they can find popular solutions to the budget, the deficit, and the national debt.

While reading Kyle Henson’s article “Cain’s Simplified Tax Plan is Step in Right Direction,” I could not help but agree with the sentiment that our tax system is in need of a radical reform, especially given the economic decline over the past several years. But Herman Cain’s proposed tax plan is not this reform. In fact, the 999 plan would be detrimental to our progress as a nation.
At its heart, the concept of Cain’s tax plan is incompatible with our economy. Capitalism depends on the existence of a disparity of wealth. Therefore, it should be logical that our taxation system account for that disparity. As a flat tax, Cain’s plan does not account for this fact, as seen in the non-partisan Tax Policy Center’s analysis of the 999 plan. Taxes would increase for the bottom four quintiles of the population, while they would decrease for the top 20 percent. Economist Jared Bernstein put this in numerical terms: Citizens within the second-highest quintile would pay an extra $4,299 on average, while the top quintile would have an average tax cut of $14,442. For the top 0.1 percent, the decrease would be over $1.3 million.
Even if wealth in our nation was previously equally distributed, these number aren’t very reasonable. The wealth analysis of G. William Domhoff, a research professor of sociology and psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, should also be considered: It demonstrates that there is already a huge disparity of wealth in this nation, with 85 percent of the nation’s wealth concentrated in the top 20 percent.
Cain’s reactionary 909 plan, which exempts people at or beneath poverty level from the 9 percent income tax, raises even more issues about the plausibility of his tax program. With Cain’s 999 plan there were already concerns — not least by economist Bruce Bartlett, who held senior policy roles in both the Reagan and H.W. Bush administrations — that the plan would not generate enough revenue. Under this new plan, the tax burden falls almost entirely on the middle class, or at least more so than it currently does. 
Also, the implications of the 909 plan are that anyone above the poverty line, regardless if they’re $10 or $10,000 above, would have to pay the full 9 percent income tax. The 909 tax is not so much a remedy but an obfuscation — there will still be people hit with a tax hike in a time when they are already struggling to survive.
Perhaps what is most frightening about Cain’s policy is Cain himself. His public desire to abolish federal welfare and his public derision of poor people — stating that if people are poor, it’s their own fault — is indicative of a mindset that is completely ignorant of the subtleties of a capitalist economy. There are many who view capitalism as an evil system based solely upon greed. But the fact is, capitalism is only an economic idea. It is people like Cain, who have no compassion for the necessary poor in a capitalist society, causing this nation to be so fractured.

As a computer science major, I spend nearly every day in the computer clusters. Well, it’s actually more like 72 hours straight up until a deadline, and then I don’t set foot in there ’til the next deadline. But that’s beside the point.
Frankly, Carnegie Mellon, we need to talk about what’s appropriate in a cluster at 4 a.m.
I hate to confirm the stereotype, but a lot of us CS majors do, in fact, smell. The first day of our Freshman Immigration Course, (or “Get out of your dorm and talk to another person or else you fail,” for all you art people), we were expressly told to shower. Some people seem to have missed that class.
Look, I get it: You’re in Wean, you’re working, and there are no windows, so you lose track of time. Terms like “morning,” “night,” or “bathtime” stop making sense after 38 hours without sleep. I’ve been there — I’ve received my fair share of angry glares and flared nostrils. But every 23 hours, you should take a break, grab a shower, pull on some clean clothes, and please, please, put on some deodorant.
Okay, so now we’re smelling good and ready to work. 
It’s about 4 a.m. and we’re typing away, in the zone. Suddenly, someone new walks into the cluster and spots his friend. They spend the next half-hour yelling at each other. Apparently, the later it gets, the louder people talk.
But hey, there are only like two other people in the cluster — what’s the big deal if you don’t whisper?
Those two people are silently wishing for your violent death.
From their point of view, it’s the middle of the night and they’re trying to work, but instead they’re going to be focusing on your friend’s story about “that one really sweet party, man. You totally had to be there.” Because no matter how inane your story, it’s better than working.
Your friend leaves to work somewhere else (he’s a little weirded out by that kid in the corner who keeps glaring at the two of you), but he calls you later to find out if you want to get food. This leads to a 20-minute conversation, one your eavesdroppers only get to hear half of. The only thing worse than being distracted by one conversation is being distracted by half of one. Instead of focusing on our work, we’re trying to figure out what question gets the answer “No, leave the horse, but bring the boombox.”
There’s nothing wrong with working with someone in a cluster. Clusters are a great place to collaborate — just keep your voice down. And if you’re going to talk on the phone, take it outside.
You’ve learned your lesson — you’re quiet, you smell good, you’re ready to work. You bring some headphones to tune out everyone and really focus. You crank the volume and start coding.
A few minutes later you notice someone violently shaking you and shouting, but you can’t hear him. You had your music turned up so loud everyone else could hear it.
This is probably the most common problem. You want to focus, so you turn up your music — except those earbuds do a terrible job of blocking out music for the rest of us. And nine times out of 10 you’re listening to some crappy techno song, since that helps you code.
After enough shaking, you finally turn down your music. But now you’ve worked up an appetite, so you grab a quick bite to bring back to the cluster and work. But what should you have — curry, a block of cheese, mung beans, or just a few cloves of garlic? Because apparently it’s impossible to bring food into the cluster that doesn’t smell like death.
Do you see the error of your ways now? Let’s recap: Shower, shut up, turn down the music, and keep the food outside. With all of this in mind, you can spend a night working without the quiet kid in the corner cursing your very existence.

I applaud Andy Peng for his thorough coverage in “‘Occupy’ Protests Come to Pittsburgh,” which appeared in The Tartan this October. According to Peng, one popular anthem of the Pittsburgh protesters was “Bail out the students, not the banks.” Peng’s account of the protesters’ stated purposes shows that Pittsburgh isn’t immune to a growing epidemic in the United States: a careless attitude toward student loans.
While I do not wish debt upon anyone, I think that the “Occupy” protesters’ demands for student loan forgiveness indicate something just as harmful as the “corporate greed” they claim to resent.
Student loan debt could not have reached a staggering $952 billion (according to FinAid.org) without students first making hundreds of thousands of high-risk investments in higher education. Across the country, “Occupy” protestors have made excuses to the media for their own student loan debt, blaming others because they subscribed to a formula for achieving the “American dream” that didn’t work as well as they thought it would. 
Student loans do not come with a “stable career after graduation or your money back” guarantee. On the contrary, loan repayment is a contractual responsibility.
I believe that a wise student is one who understands that getting an undergraduate degree is not obligatory; it is an investment that should only be made with great care. Each student should decide which type of college investment will yield the most favorable returns. For some students, this means enrolling in a reputable university and majoring in a highly demanded field. For other students, this means enrolling in an enriching college program where they plan to develop personally no matter what their job outlook will be after graduation.
It is apparent that President Obama has been listening to the “Occupy” constituents’ demands for change. Last Wednesday, Obama announced his commitment to enact the “pay as you earn plan,” which would enable income-based federal loan repayment for graduates.
According to whitehouse.gov, graduates “whose federal student loan debt is high relative to income and family size” will be eligible for this form of debt forgiveness as early as January 2012. I hope that the “pay as you earn plan” will remedy the student debt crisis, but I fear it will endorse and encourage irresponsible investments in higher education while shifting the repayment burden to taxpayers. In light of the student debt crisis that has revealed Americans’ lackadaisical regard toward student loans, we all must take investments in higher education more seriously.

That quiet place you go to read, to study, to think: the library. And for anyone who has had to pull an all-nighter, the library represents a proverbial undergraduate battleground strewn with sleeping students and empty coffee cups.
However, the library a couple blocks down the street has become a different sort of battleground.
On Nov. 8, there will be a referendum on the ballot to create a source of funding for Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, which is now in jeopardy from funding cuts. The public library system of Pittsburgh consists of 19 neighborhood locations, a community that includes learning programs and job-search assistance, and — from my own experience growing up in Pittsburgh — a place that fosters intellectual curiosity in young learners.
The referendum calls for a 0.25-mill special tax on all taxable real estate in the City of Pittsburgh to be allocated for the library, which amounts to $25 per year or $2.09 per month on $100,000 of assessed value.
To put that in perspective, that’s about the cost of a hardcover book, one-tenth the cost of an organic chemistry book, and about one two-thousandth the cost of a year’s tuition at Carnegie Mellon University. And, honestly, the public library has a much nicer atmosphere than the brutalism of Wean Hall and the dungeon-like Engineering and Science Library.
So go out and vote yes for Our Library, Our Future’s initiative and keep open a vibrant library system for yinz readers aht there.

Despite your kind and gentle demeanor, there are still people out there who are not moved by your charm. No matter how nice you are, they will still be grumpy and even rude to you.
Your biggest nightmare can be summed up in two words: graduate school.
Congratulations on balancing your schoolwork and your social life this weekend. However, you will soon realize that you could have had even more fun and still have gotten your work done.
Beware of the zombies that roam Carnegie Mellon's campus. Not only do they roam through the library and Gates at night, they also fill your morning classes and are always in line at La Prima. 
This week you will be surrounded by happy, nice, smiling people who will not be put off by your sarcasm. No matter how much you insult them, they will keep wanting to be around you. 
Your Mac will come down with a 24-hour virus that will cripple your processing speed, making your computer as powerful and as fast as a PC.
You will be in a mad rush to finish your programming assignment and will find that all of the programming TAs are unreachable. 
You will one day have the power to go back in time. Though you will end world hunger, you will forget to stop the administration from installing "Walking to the Sky." 
Your week is going to be so awesome it's scary. That or you will look back on this week and realize how good you are at suppressing your own nightmares.
Though you will take your professor’s advice when writing your essay, when you get your graded essay back, you will find that your professor has scathing remarks about all of the things he or she suggested.
Your Hulu account will be completely shut down and you will be barred from viewing any YouTube videos.
You will awaken in the early hours, desperate to turn in a forgotten assignment, and will find that the internet in your dorm has been replaced with dial-up.
