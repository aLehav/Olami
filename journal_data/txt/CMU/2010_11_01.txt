The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams opened their first home meet of the season last Saturday with double wins over Division II Clarion University, recording lopsided scores of 179–117 and 161–137, respectively.
“It was really big for our team to go out and make a statement like that,” junior Matt Stanton said. “We had planned on it being a close meet, and I think we surprised even ourselves a little with the times we were able to put up and the races we were able to win.”
After the women scored a second-place finish in the 200-yard medley relay, sophomore Daniel Glaser-Garbrick, senior Max Gustafson, first-year Terrence Wong, and Stanton stepped up and drove home the first event victory in the same event on the men’s side with a time of 1:38.31. Junior Victoria Adams and sophomore Brandon Yee each took first in the 1000-yard freestyles, outracing their opponents by seven- and 10-second gaps, respectively.
Senior Alex Hanson touched first for the 200-yard freestyle in 1:45.71, while teammates first-year Josh Chen and Glaser-Garbrick took the next two top spots. Hanson also took first in the 200-yard backstroke in 2:12.00. Senior veteran Molly Evans notched the first of three wins in the 100-yard backstroke in 59.48, while senior Michael Panzitta matched Evans’ win on the men’s side in 54.73.
Yee recorded his second win of the day with the 200-yard butterfly, touching six seconds before teammate senior Justin Whaley. Stanton followed suit and won the 50-yard freestyle in just 21.84 seconds, before he jumped right back in for the 100-yard freestyle and controlled that event as well, beating out Chen by 0.8 seconds for the top spot. Stanton also recorded his career-best time during his 50-yard race.
“Being able to win the 50 was great, especially going my best time in our first dual meet of the year,” Stanton said. “Clarion has historically dominated us in the sprint events, so being able to take both the 50 and the 100 free really got the message across that we are getting it done all across the board this season.”
Evans and Glaser-Garbrick pocketed their second wins of the day shortly after, winning the 200-yard backstroke in 2:08.56 and 1:57.52, respectively. The meet concluded with a sweep of the men’s 500-yard freestyle led by Yee, senior Frank Olechnowicz, and Whaley, and Evans’ third win in the 200-yard IM in 2:10.08.
“The effort on the women’s side was outstanding,” Evans said. “Going into the meet, we knew we needed to pull out all the stops and really race the Clarion girls if we wanted to win, and even though we lost [that race], there were some very encouraging swims and I think it said a lot about our team the way we kept it close all meet.”
After a successful season beginning, the Tartans will host their annual alumni meet this Homecoming weekend before taking on Grove City College at home on Saturday, Nov. 13. The meet begins at 1 p.m.

This past weekend proved to be a big one for the Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team. The Tartans had a rough start to their fall season and came up short in their first UAA soccer matchups against the University of Chicago, Washington University in St. Louis, Brandeis University, and New York University. The women’s team turned that trend around this past Saturday, achieving the team’s first UAA conference win of the season by a score of 1–0 against the Case Western Reserve University Spartans at home. This win not only gave the Tartans authority in UAA standings, but also brought their overall record to 7–7.
The game was very tight from beginning to end. Carnegie Mellon was able to fight its way to a win thanks to two standout performances by senior goalie Anya Rosen and first-year Alex Venegas. Rosen, who had 13 saves, held four off in the first period and, when the Spartans came fired up in the second half, proved to be a brick wall as she had nine more saves, three of which occurred in the last five tense minutes of the game. The game gave Rosen her fourth shutout this season. Venegas played a solid first half with one shot on goal. Then, 40 minutes into the first half and 23 minutes after her first shot on goal, an assist from sophomore Stephanie Hare gave the ball to Venegas, who tapped it passed the charging goalkeeper and scored. It was Venegas’s second shot on goal for the day and her sixth goal so far this season.
Overall, the Carnegie Mellon team played an excellent game. The players were able to step up as a team in the second half and really fight, fielding both a strong defense to counter the Spartans’ noticeable raise in determination and more offensive play as their desperation for a goal to tie up the game became clearer.
The Tartans look to continue their winning streak and improve their season record in their next few UAA matches. They have a week to gear up before their final UAA conference matchup against the Emory University Eagles this Sunday at home.

With only two games left this season, the Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team now has a tough task of qualifying for the NCAA Championships, having gone only 1–3–1 in conference play so far. Despite home-field advantage typically being a stronghold for the Tartans, the men fell at home to Case Western Reserve University 2–1 last Friday, marking their second loss on the new field.
Once again Carnegie Mellon relied on a young starting team, with several key upperclassmen not getting into the game until much later in the first half. The team was hoping to have sophomore midfielder John Crawshaw and junior forward Brad Edelman back, but late-season injuries kept both of them on the sidelines.
The game began with a quick tempo, with the Tartans holding onto most of the possession. Carnegie Mellon outshot Case Western Reserve nine to four in the first half, but neither team was able to find the back of the net. A frustrated Carnegie Mellon side was determined to come out and take over the game in the second half, but the Tartans’ plans were quickly foiled as Case Western scored a goal against the run of play early in the half. Bad news became worse as goalkeeper Zach Stahl had to leave the field due to injury after colliding with a Case Western Reserve player. Stahl managed to get back into the game in the 74th minute, but only to see another surprise goal immediately hit his net as Elliot Fishman from Case Western Reserve struck the ball into the upper corner. With little going the Tartans’ way, Carnegie Mellon caught a second wind after Case Western Reserve put a goal into their own net, but it was too little too late. The Tartans had to settle for their third loss this season.
Despite a solid 10–3–1 record, a difficult few weeks in conference play have dented Carnegie Mellon’s postseason chances. Having been ranked as high as second in the nation just a few weeks ago, the Tartans will now direct all of their attention in the last two games of the season to coming out on top against the University of Rochester and Emory University. Carnegie Mellon will be looking to get a big win this upcoming Sunday at home as the team takes on Emory University at 1:30 p.m.

The Carnegie Mellon football team closely missed a conference win against Washington University in St. Louis, falling in overtime 20–13 last Saturday in St. Louis. The Tartans managed to rush for 228 yards, with sophomore Patrick Blanks running for 85 yards. Senior Mike Shedlosky led the defensive side with eight tackles and one interception during the second quarter. The Cardinal and Gray moves to 4–4 overall and 0–1 for UAA play.
Wash. U. won the toss and let Carnegie Mellon receive. After three turnovers, the Tartans advanced 30 yards, resulting in senior Justin Pratt moving the ball into the Bears’ end zone with 3:13 on the clock. Senior kicker Eliot Carnevale missed the extra point, putting the Tartans ahead 6–0 at the close of the first quarter. 
Wash. U. wasted no time in moving down the field during the first three minutes of the second quarter, gaining 13 yards in three plays before the Bears’ Jim O’Brien scored a 19-yard touchdown to tie the score 6–6 after a blocked field  extra point attempt by senior Richard Pattison.
Carnegie Mellon turned up the heat with aggressive offensive plays toward the Wash. U. goal line, including a sack for loss of 16 yards by sophomore Owen Parker and sophomore Nick Karabin’s fumble recovery to score the second touchdown for the Tartans. 
Carnevale’s kick was good, and the Tartans regained the lead 13–6 with 7:28 left. Strong Tartan defense and an interception by Shedlosky kept the Bears at bay until the beginning of the fourth quarter.
The Tartans were in good shape heading into the final quarter of the game, but four turnovers later Wash. U. earned three first downs and completed a seven-play, 63-yard touchdown to even the scoreboard. 
With only 1:10 left on the clock, Carnegie Mellon was unable to return fire to end the game, prompting the Tartans’ second overtime game this year. 
Wash. U. started on the Carnegie Mellon 25-yard line and rushed the ball 35 yards past the Tartans’ defensive line to change the score to 20–13 and effectively end the game.
The Tartans will continue conference play this Saturday against the University of Chicago. Kickoff is set for 1 p.m. at Gesling Stadium.

With all the anticipation leading up to this year’s NBA season, I wouldn’t have dreamed of missing the first two games of the season, especially one that featured the star-studded Miami Heat against the equally famous Boston Celtics. If you are an NBA fan, you should know that the Heat had a huge offseason, acquiring current All-Stars and potentially future Hall of Famers LeBron James and Chris Bosh. People have been crowning them the NBA Champions since they assembled this amazing team, even before any game has been played.
However, the Heat started the season on a down note, losing its first game to the defending Eastern Conference Champions. While watching the game, millions of viewers got to see a new Nike commercial featuring James for the first time this year. Although Nike calls it a commercial, it seemed like it was just a preview of what James’s ego will be like for the rest of the year.
The commercial starts off with James sitting on a movie set, asking the audience, “What should I do?” It then cuts to multiple scenes that feature James in different roles that play off the criticism he took for making his famous decision this summer. He asks whether or not he should listen to the media and the general population, who have called him a villain, a traitor, and a championship-chaser. 
He asks whether or not he should listen to his friends, who were behind James moving to Miami this year and have taken a lot of flak for being an irrational group that steers him in the wrong direction. Overall, the commercial is James’s ego taking a shot at every NBA fan who has criticized him, in an effort to make it seem like he is unaffected by this summer’s events.
What James doesn’t realize is that this commercial shows us how much his ego has been damaged by all of the criticism that has been piled on him this summer. The act that he doesn’t care about what we say isn’t working, and it will continue to stay that way for the rest of his career. He will always be the villain to everyone outside of Miami, and until he stops listening to the morons that he considers friends, he will continue to make bad decisions. James cannot change what he has already done, and any efforts he makes to clean it up will not work. All he can do is go out onto the court and win basketball games, and even that might not bring many people to like him.
Speaking of winning basketball games, I hope the Heat doesn’t consider itself a shoo-in for the championship this year. Although it has only been three games, the Heat shows that it doesn’t have the depth to consider itself a clear-cut favorite over the Celtics and Magic in the East. 
In the team’s first game, the Celtics locked down on the Heat with their signature stellar defense, causing James to commit eight turnovers while holding the Wade/Bosh combo to only 21 total points. In the Heat’s next game against Philadelphia, James committed nine turnovers while shooting five for 12 from the floor. 
If the Heat wants to be considered the favorite to win it all, the Big Three (Wade, James, and Bosh) have to learn how to work together, along with helping out their teammates. So far this year, Bosh has been a skeleton of his normal self, and it does not look like things will improve as the season goes on. He is averaging only 10 shots per game, as opposed to the 17 shots per game that he took last year. Being a tall inside-post player, Bosh needs to get into a rhythm to be the player that he can be. After a career-high field goal percentage of over 50 percent last year, Bosh has struggled from the field, currently posting a 34.4 percentage.
Of course, the East poses another threat to the Heat’s championship run, and his name is Dwight Howard. The one known as “Superman” had a good offensive day against the Heat, much because of the Heat’s lack of a solid post-defender. In limited playing time due to the score and foul trouble, Howard scored 19 points while shooting a very efficient eight for 15 from the field. If the Heat happens to play the Magic in the postseason, it will need stellar performances from Wade and James to combat the effect that Howard will have on the game. I expect Howard to have his best games against the Heat, especially now that Orlando has lost its best chances to win a championship in the next few years.
So, what should James do? If he really wants to know, he should shut up and just play basketball.

The Carnegie Mellon volleyball team played a talented Point Park University team last Tuesday in Skibo Gymnasium. The Tartans dropped three straight in this match, losing a hard-fought contest 3–0. The scores of each game were 25–18, 25–16, and 25–19.
Junior Maddie Rosnick led the offensive attack for the Tartans with seven kills, along with senior Aislinn McCloskey and senior Caroline Size, who had six and five kills, respectively. First-year Ali Nichols had 12 digs in the match, and the recent career record-breaker, senior Cameron Griffin, added seven more digs to her new record.
Over the weekend, the Tartans competed in the Wittenberg Fall Classic, where they played some of the top teams in the nation. Their matches were tough, losing each 3–0, as they played the College of Mount St. Joseph on Friday, and Juniata College and the host team Wittenberg University on Saturday.
The team from Mount St. Joseph is one of the best in the nation. The Tartans lost in three games, 25–12, 25–6, and 25–23 in a competitive game three. While the Tartans’ offense was a balanced attack throughout the match, the primary distributor was first-year Kerry Hennessy with 13 assists. She also held down the defense with nine digs, followed by Griffin who contributed seven.
The Tartans’ next match in the tournament against Juniata — recently rankedfourth by the AVCA Division III Coaches Top 25 Poll — ended in a 3–0 defeat, Carnegie Mellon losing the games 25–23, 25–21, and 25–20. First-year Senna Parsa and McCloskey contributed seven kills each, with Hennessy assisting 21 times. Griffin added 15 digs, leading the defense.
The last match of the weekend against top team Wittenberg — polled third in the nation — ended in a 3–0 loss for the Tartans, losing 25–8, 25–22, 25–15. Senna had eight kills, and McCloskey had seven. Hennessy put up 19 assists, and Nichols grinded out 12 digs.
It was a challenging weekend for the Tartans, going up against some of the best competition they will see this season. The Tartans were also without their usual setter, first-year Emily Wright, due to an illness. Hennessy stepped in for Wright and racked up the assists, leading the Tartans in that category in every match at the Wittenberg Fall Classic.
The Tartans’ next match is this Friday, when they play their first round at the UAA Championships.

It is a rare and celebratory event when a Carnegie Mellon athlete breaks a school record. During a match against Susquehanna University last week, senior policy and management major and volleyball libero Cameron Griffin broke the 2,000 mark and school record for digs, previously held by current volleyball team manager and alumna Lauren Schmidt. Griffin, a four-year varsity letter winner and team co-captain, has been playing volleyball for 14 years. She has played every position on the team, including setter during Senior Night after a teammate became sick.
After close losses to top-polled teams and three UAA weekends of round-robin play, the sixth-seeded volleyball team will compete in the UAA Championships this weekend. 
“It’s really anyone’s game at this point,” Griffin said. “This isn’t our best year, to be honest. We play a lot of top-25 schools, and we’ve had approximately 11 close losses in five games, where we lose the last game 15–12. We just have some trouble concentrating and finishing up the match. We have a young team so sometimes we lose focus. We just want to stir things up, and our goal is to have fun.”
One of Griffin’s best memories with the volleyball team is when the team qualified for the NCAA Championships in 2008 and beat Lebanon Valley College, a school with a nearly flawless 21–1 record at the time, 3–0 in the opening round. To Griffin, this was a statement that proved Carnegie Mellon was among the best teams in the nation and was a force to be reckoned with.
Griffin is graduating early this year, after which she will spend a few months traveling around Europe and looking for a job. This semester, Griffin is overloading her classes and has a busy schedule with volleyball, but still finds time to have fun with team members, with whom she considers to be good friends. She also has a lot of respect for volleyball head coach Kim Kelly, who Griffin said is very maternal and treats the team like her own children. As captain, Griffin helps build cohesiveness and camaraderie with team outings, ice cream runs, and team-building exercises during practice. 
“The freshmen can mature a bit and get to know their roles. They are a great but young team. We’re going to just play the best  we can,” she said.

Homecoming has always been about instilling Carnegie Mellon pride in current students and alumni. With this objective in mind, famous alumni will kick-start this year’s Homecoming weekend by sharing their journeys to success with the campus community.
The Alumni Awards are presented for excellence in a variety of disciplines, including arts, humanities, sciences, technology, and business. 
On Thursday, the recipients of the 2010 Alumni Distinguished Achievement Award will share their stories. One of the two recipients is Naoko Matsubara (A ’62), an accomplished woodcut artist.
Matsubara received her bachelor’s degree in arts at the Kyoto Academy of Fine Art in Japan. She received a Fulbright Scholarship after her bachelor’s degree and came to Carnegie Mellon (called Carnegie Tech at the time) to complete her master’s in fine arts. She also has an honorary doctorate degree from Chatham University.
Matsubara last visited Pittsburgh in 2009 for an exhibit at the Carnegie Museum of Art and Chatham University’s art gallery. In an interview with The Tartan, Matsubara explained that Pittsburgh is special for her, as it was the first place she came to from her home in Japan.
Coming to the United States in 1960 was a life-changing experience, Matsubara said. It was the first time she had left Japan, and she felt a “wonderful sense of freedom.” At Carnegie Mellon, she had the freedom to take whatever classes she wanted and was not required to take any she did not want to — an idea that was new to her. The general environment at Carnegie Mellon was also conducive to making art; Matsubara described her studio at that time, which overlooked Schenley Park, as “beautiful.”
Along with this inspiring atmosphere and greater freedom, Matsubara was given a responsibility: She had to focus her thoughts and find out exactly what she wanted to do. “[There are] so many things you can do in fine arts,” Matsubara said. For her, the most difficult task in those early days was to focus on one aspect of the broad spectrum of things she could do. Matsubara explained that, for a long time, she “tried to find what [she] really wanted to do.” It was not until one evening in 1961 that she realized what this was. Her friends asked her to accompany them to a concert by the Indian musician Ravi Shankar at Chatham University. Matsubara had never heard Shankar’s music and did not know what to expect before she went to the concert.
As Matsubara put it, after the concert, she was “breathless.” She explained that experiencing such wonderful music helped clear her mind, and that after the concert, she understood what she was supposed to do. The next day, she went to her studio and started working on a woodcut based on the feelings she had about the concert. 
Ever since that day, Matsubara realized that making woodcuts and using them to make prints was what she wanted to pursue for life.
After graduating from Carnegie Mellon in 1962, Matsubara traveled extensively all over the world. According to the University Lecture Series website, Matsubara has had solo exhibits in the U.S., Canada, Japan, England, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Holland, and Mexico. Matsubara also gained inspiration for projects from her trips across the world. She said that one of the most memorable traveling experiences was visiting Tibet. According to an article published in the Pittsburgh City Paper, Tibet changed “Matsubara’s perception of space and color.” Her travels in Tibet led to the publication of a book of her artwork titled Tibetan Sky that has a forward by the Dalai Lama. Apart from her travels, Matsubara’s art has significant connections to her home country, Japan.
A lot of her work is based on nature, an aspect she explained is related to her father and his teachings. Her father was a priest and instilled in her an admiration for the divine and for nature. Currently, Matsubara is working on murals and a series of abstract artwork.
Matsubara believes that the most important thing for budding artists to keep in mind is that they need to find their own direction. She believes that this is especially hard since there is a variety of types of art into which an artist can delve deeper. 
“You can study from other artists,” Matsubara said, “[but] only you can do your own thing. Art has to be a reflection of your own life.”
Matsubara’s lecture will be on Thursday at 4:30 p.m. in the Rashid Auditorium in the Hillman Center. 
Along with Matsubara, Stuart Card, the second recipient of the 2010 Alumni Distinguished Achievement Award, will talk about his life experiences. Card is a senior research fellow at the Palo Alto Research Center, where he is currently the manager of the User Interface Research Group.

The Carnegie Mellon campus is getting prepared to host another fun-filled weekend for the alumni who make the university so prestigious. Every year, the Student Homecoming Committee hosts a number of events during the weekend to reacquaint alumni with their alma mater. This year, the purpose remains the same but is being implemented in a manner different from past years.
This year’s Homecoming weekend has been structured along the lines of Spring Carnival, with a well-known comedian and free gifts at the Highland Games similar to those distributed at Midway during Booth.
Maricel Paz, a junior general CIT major and the chair of the Student Homecoming Committee, said that the committee has been trying to make students and alumni very enthusiastic about Homecoming. 
“We’re trying to make it a bigger event and have it gain more recognition because it seems like most of the student body doesn’t even know about Homecoming,” Paz said. “We just want more exciting events that people could be enthusiastic about.” 
They have promoted interest since the beginning of the semester by holding various recruitment events and spreading the word with events such as distributing free pastries early in the morning near the Cut. 
The Homecoming Committee has also been collaborating with other student organizations, such as MayurSASA, Bhangra in the Burgh, Scotch’n’Soda, and the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. 
Through the various events that these organizations will hold during Homecoming weekend, like the Battle of the Bands (hosted by Sigma Phi Epsilon), Bhangra in the Burgh, a Diwali and Eid ul-Fitr celebration (hosted by MayurSASA), and The Rocky Horror Picture Show (a Scotch’n’Soda production) — the committee wants not only the alumni but also the current students to celebrate school pride.
This year, the Student Homecoming Committee has tried to increase the participation of current students in the events happening throughout the weekend.
The committee is trying to boost school pride and create a general understanding of the institution from which students get their degree. “We want students to know that it’s not just a piece of paper you get from here, but it’s the experience,” Paz said.
Even though many of the events are directed more towards the current students, Paz is hopeful that alumni will still show a lot of interest. 
She hopes that, like last year, if an event catches an alumnus’ attention, he or she will definitely stop by, narrate an incident from his or her time, and share his or her experiences.
Paz mentioned that one of the events that was especially popular among the alumni was the Highland Games. According to the Carnegie Mellon website, in the Highland Games, the participants compete with their class — first-year, sophomore, junior, senior, or alumni groups — and they do so while they enjoy food, performances, and Scottish tradition. The Student Homecoming Committee wants attendees — whether they be alumni or current students — to go and support their teams.
The committee’s efforts in trying to attract a more students have paid off. A large number of students are expected to attend the events this year. 
“Around 200 people have replied on each Facebook event, and the numbers can go higher because the events are hosted with a lot more organizations,” Paz said. 
She thinks that the committee is still working up to a big Homecoming — something that may be possible in a few more years.
Paz also believes that the Loyal Scot program has the potential of attracting a lot of students and alumni as well. As mentioned on www.cmu.edu/loyalscot, one needs to follow four steps each year to be designated as a Loyal Scot. 
Loyal Scots are also eligible for a number of small gifts — an incentive that Paz believes might draw more students towards the program. 
Paz explained that attending different events during Homecoming can fulfill the requirements of at least one of the required four steps.
The members of the Homecoming Committee have worked very hard for the last six to eight months to plan and organize the upcoming Homecoming weekend. 
They worked through the summer and collaborated with various organizations many times through the year to put up a good weekend and make Homecoming a time when both the alumni and the students remember what Carnegie Mellon has given them.

Linear equations are a fundamental part of mathematics. Many of us have been taught how to solve these equations for an unknown variable since middle school. In the real world, applications of linear equations — or, in some cases, systems of linear equations — are significant. Unfortunately, solving a large set of linear equations can be time-consuming for algorithmic solvers, but researchers from Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science have developed an algorithm that uses graph theory and linear algebra to expedite the solving process.
Gary Miller, a faculty member in the School of Computer Science, teaches both undergraduate and graduate courses in algorithms, along with graduate courses in computational geometry and spectral graph theory. He started his research on linear equations in the 1990s. He called the traditional method of solving linear equations, known as Gaussian elimination, “both space-inefficient and time-inefficient,” when it comes to large sets of linear equations.
“For [linear equations] problems these days, it’s not unusual to have a billion variables,” Miller said from his office in the Gates Hillman Complex. “This is a classic problem in theoretical computer science.”
Gaussian elimination is a method commonly presented in junior high and high school in which systems of multivariable linear equations are solved by eliminating one of the variables and solving in terms of another. While this method has use for problems relating just a few variables, a greater number of variables would increase the time required to solve the equations manually. According to an article on Dr. Dobb’s Journal, a computer programming website, the time it takes for a computer to solve a system of linear equations is proportional to the cube of the number of variables.
Miller, systems scientist Ionnis Kurtis, and graduate student Richard Peng applied graph theory and a class of problems known as symmetric diagonally dominant (SDD) systems to linear systems. The same information that can be modeled in a graph using graph theory can also be modeled in a matrix with SDD systems. These matrices typically require a lot of time to solve, but with the new algorithm, such a matrix can be solved in a matter of seconds. In the new algorithm, the data is first imported into a matrix, which generates a sequence of graphs that can be solved using the data and a method known as Chebyshev iteration.
The same Dr. Dobb’s article states that the new algorithm’s run time, for a system of n variables, is proportional to n[log(n)]2, almost a million times faster than Gaussian elimination.
Real-world systems of linear equations can take many forms. Miller used a circuit diagram of resistors and wires as an example. The diagram is considered the weighted graph, and the voltage and resistance values in the circuit can be modeled in a matrix. The algorithm can be applied to the matrix for large circuits to solve for any unknowns. Miller also used the Netflix movie rental website, which uses trend analyses for viewers to suggest similar movies to ones that they have already watched, as another example.
As for marketing the code, Miller reported a fair number of users using the code with success. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, for example, has used similar coding in the past for biological retinal images of the eye and of cartilage of the knee. Miller also encouraged other programmers to distribute and debug their code for testing. “You’re allowed to have the whole world help you develop this great piece of code,” Miller said. “And then at some later date, you can then sell it to someone.”
“What I’m excited about is the [applications of the algorithm] that I haven’t thought of,” he said. “By releasing the code, people hopefully will tell us a bunch of new [applications].”

Happiness, sadness, fear, pride, curiosity, and empathy: These are all examples of emotions that, in many ways, show who we are. They influence our decisions and give us a personality that is distinct from anyone else’s. As a result, many theories attempt to describe and explain emotions. However, because the cause, duration, and intensity of emotions can vary greatly, it has previously been hard to create a unifying theory.
According to www.humanillnesses.com, the concept of an emotion can be broken down into three component parts: Subjective feelings, physiological responses, and expressive behavior. Because subjective feelings are just that — subjective — these can be difficult for scientists to quantify. In contrast, physiological responses can be measured as increases in heart rate or the release of chemicals in the body.
Studies in neurobiology have shown that the limbic system of the brain is involved in producing emotions, which are responses to either pleasant or unpleasant stimuli. The brain produces certain chemicals that cause the physical effects of emotion. One chemical, for example, is adrenaline, which causes increased heart rate, breathing rate, and blood flow and prepares people for stressful situations. Another is serotonin, which has been observed to increase when a person is experiencing feelings of happiness and love.
In addition, emotions are expressed outwardly in the face — the limbic system controls the subconscious movement of facial muscles that express certain emotions. As a result, we do not have to think about smiling when we are happy; we just smile.
Emotions likely evolved to improve our survival ability. According to www.changingminds.org, the purposes of emotions are motivation to act, generating internal signals, and generating social signals. The emotion of fear is an example of motivation — when we feel fear, we move away from whatever unpleasant stimulus is causing the fear, while physiological changes in our bodies facilitate this movement.
Internal signals can be created when making decisions — if the decision contradicts knowledge gained from experience, an unpleasant emotion may be triggered, which will compel us not to make that decision. For example, if a certain restaurant caused a person to get food poisoning, making the decision to eat at that restaurant again will generate a negative emotion in that person.
Social signals arise from the effect that emotions have on our body language. Seeing someone with an expression of happiness will make him or her seem more approachable than someone displaying outward anger or disgust. In this way, emotions dictate how people behave towards each other.
When trying to connect emotion with physiology, one of the most accepted models of emotion is the “two-factor theory,” which was proposed in 1962. This model states that generating emotions requires both a physiological stimulus as well as an understanding of that stimulus. For example, to be afraid, we must understand that the stimulus may be dangerous. Arriving at this model did not happen quickly, however. One of the earliest theories on emotion is the James-Lange theory of emotion, which was proposed in 1884. It states that emotions happen as a result of experience, according to www.changingminds.org. However, scientific experiments have shown evidence that contradicts this theory. This theory was challenged by the Cannon-Bard theory, which proposed that emotions and physiological reactions occur in conjunction. However, many criticized this theory because it made it seem as if emotions were generated spontaneously, without any biological mechanism.
The difficulty in arriving at a theory that explains emotion reflects its complexity. To generate an emotion, we must understand the stimulus that caused it and compare it to our past experiences to determine if the stimulus is harmful or not. Then, the brain must secrete the correct chemical to produce the correct response in our body. The study of emotions is ongoing, and discoveries will lead to further insight in the mechanisms of the brain.

As the Internet has evolved, it has also become increasingly personal. Shopping sites recognize users and remember their items in shopping carts; Flash games remember a player’s progress through the game; users’ settings and personalization on websites are maintained. In order for this to happen, websites make use of small information files known as cookies.
Cookies may sound like they have something to do with delicious baked goods, but in terms of the Internet, they are simply small text files that allow a website to store information related to the user of the computer. The term cookie comes from “magic cookie,” a UNIX term describing small packets of data sent between communicating programs. These files are contained on the user’s computer, usually in the web browser’s folder.
The information in a cookie is generally stored as attribute-value pairs, which means that it assigns a certain definition to a variable. For example, if a website allows a user to change the color of the text to blue, the cookie may store the attribute as “text color,” and the value as “blue.” The text in a cookie is usually written in a sort of code; for example, saving a ZIP code as a user’s location on www.msn.com creates the following line in the website’s cookie: “WEAT CC=PA%5FPittsburgh%2DOakland&REGION=”. Information in this code is easily spotted due to its keywords.
According to www.howstuffworks.com, the web browser itself will look for cookies in the computer folder specified for storing cookies. The browser will then open the file that is requested from a certain website, if one exists. All attribute-value pair information is then sent to the website so the layout can be tailored to the person accessing it. If no cookie file exists, a new one will be created.
In addition, browsers regularly maintain cookies, according to www.cookiecentral.com. Cookies also specify expiration dates. When these dates are reached, the browser will automatically delete the file from the computer.
Websites can also use cookies for statistical information, like tracking how many users visit the site, how many return, and which pages they visit. This is possible because websites can assign user IDs to computers, which are tracked using cookies. A counter in the cookie file can be set to increase every time the website is accessed by a computer with the same ID.
Cookies provide an easy way to customize and maintain the look of webpages to a user’s need, and it expedites the services they provide. However, many people believe cookies may be a threat to personal security, or that cookies may infect a computer with a virus. While it is true that cookies collect a user’s information, they are not programs that can be run on the computer, according to www.surfthenetsafely.com. Therefore, they are not viruses or any malicious programs that can read or erase information from a hard drive, and they will not cause pop-ups.
Surfing the Internet is made more convenient with cookies, and they are harmless information files, but there are still drawbacks. Cookies can be intercepted as they are being relayed from website to computer, in a process called hijacking. One such attack, dubbed the CookieMonster, was used to track authentication cookies sent from various sites. Authentication cookies may be able to give someone access to another user’s account. Considering that some websites under attack belonged to major banking companies, this hijacking can become a serious problem. Another cookie exploitation is called Firesheep, and allows people to log on other users’ Facebook and Twitter accounts.
Another attack is called cookie poisoning, which is when an attacker changes values on a cookie before it is stored on a user’s computer. This can be used to change the amount paid in transactions without the user knowing. To counteract this, websites might store sensitive information on their servers while putting only a session ID in the cookie.
While people still debate whether the benefits of cookies outweigh the threats that they may pose, in the long run, cookies make the Internet more convenient and dynamic.

A crater on the moon containing water in the form of ice grains has been discovered by NASA.
Flamingos use their food to turn pink
Scientists in the wetlands of southern Spain have observed the most common flamingo species, greater flamingos, rubbing self-produced pigments on their feathers to brighten their colors. These naturally occurring colorants are carotenoids, the organic pigments responsible for the orange and red hues visible in autumn leaves, which are made in many types of plankton that flamingos consume. After the plankton are eaten, these carotenoids are transferred into the wax oil that flamingos produce in their uropygial, or preen, glands. This preening oil repairs feathers and renders them waterproof, and in flamingos, alters the color of their naturally light pink feathers to a more vibrant tint.
The researchers found that flamingos with brighter feathers may have higher success in attracting mates. Those with more colorful plumage — and, consequently, the flamingos that had spent more time rubbing preening oil onto their feathers — began breeding earlier than paler flamingos, which leads to first priority in selecting breeding sites. In addition, flamingos cover themselves in preening oil more often when they have better habitats and higher-quality food, indicating an apparent correlation between good health and brilliance of color.

NASA finds moon crater containing water
The National Air and Space Administration (NASA) discovered evidence of water at the bottom of the Moon’s Cabeus crater, a location with temperatures typically at negative 370 degrees Fahrenheit. The water is in the form of ice grains mixed with the lunar soil, and it makes up 5.6 to 8.5 percent of the composite. In comparison, sand in the Sahara Desert contains only 2 to 5 percent water. As one of the coldest places in the solar system, the Cabeus crater has acted as a “cold trap,” preserving a physical record of collisions and regional debris since the formation of the moon billions of years ago.
NASA discovered the existence of abundant water through observations made by the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, which crashed into the moon last year in order to survey it firsthand. The satellite’s impact agitated at least 26 gallons of water in the soil. After transmitting data regarding the water concentration, the instruments in the reconnaissance mission also found compounds such as calcium, magnesium, and mercury.

Fossils suggest new origin for primates
Four recently discovered primate fossils in what is now Libya allude to possible anthropoid — a group consisting of monkeys and apes, which include humans — origins in the Middle East, rather than Africa, as has been the conventional account of human development. The fossils, which are 40 million years old, belong to four species and three taxonomic families. Their disparity indicates a separate point of origin for the evolution of the primates, which were located in Asia at the time of their deposition when the continents were closer together. No other primates were known to have lived in Africa at the time, based on other extant fossils, which implies either an earlier emergence of anthropoids in Africa than previously thought, or the migration of anthropoids from Asia.
Among the scientists who described the fossils in the journal Nature, Christopher Beard, a paleontologist at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, hypothesized that Asia is now the more probable origin for the “Dawn Monkey,” or Eosimias, which is the genus to which one of the fossils belongs. However, other paleontologists are wary about making assumptions too early, calling instead for a more measured response.

Artist spotlight: An interview and acoustic session with Tim Ruff
Ted Danson, Zachary Quinto, Andy Warhol — with so many established graduates from every department, Carnegie Mellon is no stranger to reputable alumni. Odds are that the sophomore from calculus class or that senior from the Activities Fair will go on to do tremendous things after graduation, and with a student body that works so intensely, it’s always encouraging to see the work and effort of our peers pay off.
One young alumnus whose talent and efforts are leading the way to success is 2010 graduate Tim Ruff. Chances are that you have seen this Indiana native around campus, whether he was your Orientation counselor, a brother in your fraternity, or merely a smiling face that helped complete your maintenance request for a lofted bed.
Ruff, a vocal performance major before graduating from the College of Fine Arts last year, has always had a prominent voice around campus. He has performed acoustic shows at Skibo Café, played the Emperor of Japan in the School of Music’s rendition of The Mikado, and made a guest performance at Sigma Phi Epsilon’s Battle of the Bands.
Ruff, who once dreamed of becoming an inventor, has become just that through music. Having picked up guitar in seventh grade, Ruff wrote his first original song during his junior year of high school and since then has grown into a strong singer and songwriter. In an interview with the performer, The Tartan got a peek into the release of his new CD Winter’s Coming, his battle to make it in the professional music world, and how Carnegie Mellon has helped him along the way.
How did you first start writing music?
My first experience writing music was in fourth grade when my music class started playing recorder, and I transcribed a couple songs and melodies from Titanic into recorder and played them for the student body.
You came to Carnegie Mellon to study classical music, but did you always know that you wanted to be a songwriter?
Professionally, no, I did not know that I wanted to be a songwriter. I thought that I enjoyed kind of dabbling in songwriting, but I didn’t actually think I’d make a career out of it.
Do you plan on applying your classical training in any way?
With my classical voice and music training, my musicianship training has taken me leaps and bounds from where I was before attending Carnegie Mellon. The classical technique helps so much with pop singing and any other singing I might want to do.
Do you have any advice for current voice majors about Carnegie Mellon and what to expect when you graduate?
Bust your butt while you’re in school and get as much as you can from the professors and from the facilities that they offer here. After graduation, continue to bust your butt and find your path.
What have you been doing since graduation, and how have things changed?
Right now I’ve been basically getting my music career off the ground; getting a website up; getting more media, photos, videos; writing more music; meeting a lot of the Pittsburgh musicians; and playing the area. What has changed since I left school — no class; my day is completely self-driven. There is nobody who tells me what to do, suggests songs that I should or should not perform. It’s my own life.
You just released your first album. What does it feel like to see your work get finalized?
It feels like a lot of stress has been lifted off of your shoulders to know that you can have something hard and final to show to people. It’s very fulfilling.
What was the process to record like?
First of all, we spent a number of hours in the studio recording for the acoustic EP specifically. I actually spent around three or four hours recording the whole thing, just me and the guitar, and then I worked in the Carnegie Mellon recording suites with [junior electrical and computer engineering major and audio engineering minor] Adam Kriegel to mix and master the music to our liking.
Are you going to use this album to possibly get signed by a record label?
Who knows. I mean, I’m going to be submitting this disc to many people, and I am still debating the idea of getting signed and how much I want to be affiliated with major labels or a label.
Are you intimidated by the business? You obviously knew coming into this major that it would be hard to truly make it; how did you deal with that?
It’s been the same as it has been for maybe the past two or three years. I feel like, yeah, it’s pretty tough to break into the music industry per se, to be successful in a music career — success being making a living off of my music. I know that I work really hard to get things done, and I have good faith in my music.
What is your favorite song off the new album and why?
My favorite song off the album is “Busy Bee,” specifically because I have no idea how I came up with the musical composition of the song, while the lyrical side of the song was very planned out. I had no idea it was going to be such a nice little tune. I don’t usually like to listen to my own music a lot because it’s annoying to hear yourself over and over again after the recording process, but I like listening to that song. I would have to say that the runner-up favorite on the CD would be “Lady,” and this one I can’t explain very much. Overall, I think it’s one of the most solid songs I have.
What do you typically write about in your songs?
If anybody were to listen to my whole music repertoire, they would say that I like to write love songs. Most of my songs are love songs, but I’ve recently branched out a bit to zero in on certain ideas and people in my life.
How do you turn an idea or emotion into a song? What is the creative process?
The creative process for my songs differs with every song. It can start from just a simple melody that I like and fiddle around with, turn some chords over, and lyrics kind of manifest themselves from that. Or it can start from a poem that I write, and then the music just kind of comes out.
How do you feel about performing?
I love to perform; it’s quite natural to me. On stage with a big crowd, it’s terrifying at times. It depends on how big of a crowd we’re talking. Actually, being able to communicate with a larger audience is one of the things that I’ve really been working on over this past summer: not only being able to play for a couple college students, but being able to walk onto a stage at a major venue and being able to play for hundreds of people. At this point, it’s a work in progress to be able to handle that kind of communication, but it’s exciting and enjoyable every time I do it.
What has Carnegie Mellon given you? What are you most thankful for?
Carnegie Mellon has given me a good work ethic, a good perspective on life, and a large amount of professionalism, which I find is very helpful to start your own business.
And what do you want to give back to Carnegie Mellon?
I would like to give back to Carnegie Mellon some innovative ideas on how my story and stories like mine can be perpetuated. I would also like to give back financially, of course, to be in a place where I can do that. I also want to show people that Carnegie Mellon is an incredible school where people truly can do anything they put their mind to.
What’s next for Tim Ruff?
“The next step,” said Ruff, “is to figure out what life is where I want to go with mine.” Tim will be staying in Pittsburgh, a place he calls his launch pad for bigger and better things, from the next six months to a year. “The eventual goal,” said Ruff, “is to be able to make a living off of my music.”
Until then, you can see Ruff at the Tim Ruff: Winter’s Coming Release Party and Show at the Underground at 8 p.m. on Monday, November 22nd. There will be live music, a surprise opening act, and if you haven’t picked up a copy of Ruff’s CD, he will be selling them at the show.

Taylor Swift, the young, innocent face of country-pop, returns to the music scene with her highly anticipated third album, Speak Now. Since her previous two albums easily went multi-platinum, we’re thinking this one is going to be a big deal too.
He said:
Swift’s first single, “Mine,” is a catchy guilty pleasure about that storybook romance that everyone associates with her. Maybe it’s not the story of everyone’s life, but you’re probably hitting repeat after it’s over.
“Sparks Fly” might be the quintessential Taylor Swift song. There are lyrics about love and a catchy hook, and she sings like a page of her diary has been torn out. Fun fact: Swift was the sole writer for all 14 songs on the album. Not a single co-writer!
The album’s first ballad, “Back to December,” has incredible lyrics. Her voice is a bit deeper than on the other tracks, which might come as a shocker to some listeners. Essentially, though, it’s a song of regret, and it’s a pretty dramatic ballad — one of Swift’s staples.
With “Speak Now,” the lyrics in the verse can seem a bit cheesy at first, but listeners can come to like them as they get lost in the catchiness of the charming song about making one’s voice heard when a preacher says, “Speak now or forever hold your peace.”
Don’t be wary about “Dear John” just because it’s 6:44 long. It feels like a long song, but it’s not boring. Swift sings a victim’s cry, listing the faults and misdeeds of her wrongdoer. This heartbreaking tale, with some bluesy guitar tossed in, is allegedly about John Mayer.
Listen to “The Story of Us.” Swift’s dishes out another song from her strongest suit: upbeat songs about love. She knows how to write well; she’s a fresh, modern artist; and she can put together a great piece of music. This is definitely one of the album’s better songs, if only for its picking up the pace from the numerous lengthy ballads.
“Enchanted” is almost six minutes long, but it doesn’t feel drawn out at all. The lyrics flow quite smoothly on top of the beat, and the gentle verses crescendo into a bold chorus where Swift showcases a higher vocal range.
“Innocent” is a classy jab. It’s her response to the 2009 Video Music Awards incident with Kanye West (“Imma let you finish…”), but it doesn’t outright bash him. Lyrically, the song’s a true gem. The beautifully dramatic tune tells how West is still immature, but she’s able to forgive him for his interruption. (Still not convinced it’s about West? How about this lyric: “It’s okay, life is a tough crowd — 32 and still growing up now.” West was 32 years old at the time of the VMAs).
The music of “Haunted” sounds like it’s taken from a Trans-Siberian Orchestra concert. Maybe it doesn’t work as a Taylor Swift song because it’s not what listeners are used to, but abandon the mindset that she’s a one-trick pony and we can appreciate the song for the song itself. 
“Last Kiss” is definitely another gentle ballad in the vein of “Enchanted,” but it never really picks up the energy. Still, though, it’s a nice piece of music. Though many of Swift’s songs make you want to curl up in a state of depression beside a window and watch the rain fall, they’re great standalone tracks — this one included. This is one of five songs on the new album that’s over five minutes long and one of two that’s longer than six minutes.
Thematically, “Long Live” is a perfect closing song. It sounds a bit like “Change,” Swift’s song for the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team. It’s a great song to end a dramatic romance film, when the two lovers realize that everything is right when they are together.
Listen up: “Mine,” “Dear John,” “The Story of Us”
The verdict: The third time’s a charm. Though it would be tough to pit Swift’s three albums against each other and pick a clear-cut winner, you surely won’t be disappointed here. She provides an even bigger range of songs and styles on this album, so it’d be safe to say that this is Swift’s most mature and creative album. Oh yeah — and the songs are great too.
She Said:
“Speak Now” is a cute, catchy number that entertains the fears every girl has about the man she loves marrying the wrong girl, and what she should do about it. Speaking out is a clear theme across the album.
At 6:44, “Dear John” can feel a little long, especially when you’re multi-tasking and you lose track of the song, only to come back and realize it’s still going. It’s a slow ballad about the naiveté of a 19-year-old and an older man taking advantage of it. The song is a good one, but it would’ve been better if it were shorter.
“Never Grow Up” is a sad tale of a girl who wishes she had never grown up. Swift starts the song by projecting the story onto someone else and, midway through the song, loops it back to her. The idea is nice, but the song itself is not worth listening to.
“Enchanted” is a great song many girls can relate to about the rush that follows meeting a boy for the first time. It’s neither slow nor pop-y, settling on a middle ground that keeps the song both moving and interesting.
“Better Than Revenge” is a fun song about getting revenge on a girl who stole a boy. Swift is sassy and uses many clever lines in this song.
Despite the fact that “Innocent” is a song Swift probably had to do, since she always writes about important moments in her life, it’s not a song that will have a high play count in your library. She forgives West in this song, telling him that he’s still an “innocent.” It’s another slow ballad, one of a few on this album, but it’s easily one of the less memorable ones.
“Last Kiss” is another slow song that tells the heartbreaking tale of a girl losing a boy she never thought she’d lose. She reminisces about the time they spent together and wonders why he left.
“Long Live” is powerful and fun. It’s about a boy and a girl making a difference together, breaking through walls set by others. Swift sings, “I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you.”
Listen up: “Enchanted,” “Last Kiss,” “Long Live”
The verdict: Swift pulls out another cohesive album filled with great songs. Some of the songs are sub-par, and others are not memorable, but the good ones are brilliant, and there are more than a few of those.

The Adamson Writers Series presented its second speaker of the year, Phillip Lopate, this past Wednesday in Giant Eagle Auditorium. The Adamson Writers Series is a free event put on by the English department that invites distinguished writers to come to Carnegie Mellon to read their works.
Hilary Masters, a published author and faculty member in the English department, introduced Lopate as a “man of letters who pursues truth when he sees it.” Lopate is an accomplished novelist, poet, biographer, and essayist. A Brooklyn native, he received his B.A. from Columbia University in 1964 and a doctorate from the Union Graduate School in 1979.
Lopate, who still retains a touch of his Brooklyn accent, read from a selection of his writings, intersplicing his own personal history during breaks in his reading. He explained that he began his writing career as a poet in the 1960s, drawing inspiration from Nicanor Parra’s Poems and Anti-Poems. 
Lopate identified with the unsentimental and sardonic writing form used in the collection. He developed his own writing style based on Parra’s, penning honest, funny insights about day-to-day life. 
Lopate eventually left poetry after falling in love with the personal essay, but kept his trademark unembellished style. He believes that the essay form is intrinsically rational and comes from the conscious mind more than poetry or prose does. As he said, on any given day, he’d “rather be sane than insane.” Lopate is most famous for his creative nonfiction. He loves the simplicity of being able to sit down and frankly write, “So here’s what happened.”
Lopate has been awarded a John Simon Guggeheim Fellowship, a New York Public Library Center For Scholars and Writers Scholarship, two National Endowments for the Arts grants, and two New York Foundation for the Arts grants.

Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream is opening in Carnegie Mellon’s stage next month. The show, which opens Nov. 18, is expected to be a big hit. 
The adaptation by voice and speech professor Don Wadsworth stresses the word “dream,” bringing the story to life through the eyes of Bottom, a weaver whose head is transformed into that of a donkey,  played by senior drama major Timothy Harrington.
The new adaptation adds depth to the classic characters, drawing on what makes them magical and inspiring. 
With characters like Oberon, played by senior drama major Daniel Weschler, and Titania, played by senior drama major Gabrielle McClinton, representing fire and water, we see a production grounded in the elements of nature. The crew spent months working together, being inspired by images in current culture. 
After the first run-through, it is apparent that the show is about taking Shakespeare to the next level, making it larger than the audience’s imagination can handle.
With amazing attention to detail, the cast and crew of Midsummer have combined their talents to incorporate elements of physicality and acrobatics into this production. The modern technologies used to support this production range from iPads to skateboards. Throughout the rehearsal the cast has gained a personal connection to Shakespeare’s immortal words.
The 90-minute, one-act production shines a new light on this romantic comedy. Throughout the rigorous rehearsal schedule, the actors and crew have worked vigorously to perfect this creative piece.
It is sure to be an engaging production, filled with gaiety and beautiful imagery that will amaze your senses.
A Midsummer Night’s Dream will be performed in the Philip Chosky Theater, in the Purnell Center for the Arts. Tickets and play times can be found at www.cmu.edu/cfa/drama/.

The Experience Hendrix Tour made its Pittsburgh debut last Tuesday at the Benedum Center. The tour is a tribute to the life and music of Jimi Hendrix, giving audiences a unique opportunity to experience Hendrix’s music in live performance and a chance to experience the legacy in a way that a recording could never capture. The tour features now-Pittsburgh resident Billy Cox, the only surviving member of the original Jimi Hendrix Experience and Band of Gypsys. Cox met Hendrix in 1961 when they were in the army together, serving in the 101st Airborne Division in Fort Campbell, Ky. Cox would eventually go on to replace Noel Redding and play with Hendrix at one show that changed history: Woodstock.
Having an original member of the Experience was a considerable initial attraction, but the rest of the set read like a list of who’s who in rock today: Steve Vai, Jonny Lang, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Eric Johnson, Brad Whitford of Aerosmith, Cesar Rosas and David Hidalgo of Los Lobos, Living Colour, Chris Layton of Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble, Ernie Isley, Mato Nanji of Indigenous, and The Slide Brothers. This group shared the Benedum stage for an electrifying celebration.
When the lights dimmed, the night opened with a striking performance of “Stone Free” by Cox on bass and vocals, Isley on guitar and vocals, and Layton on the drums. The night rolled on, showing one explosive set after another. The opening performance was followed by Living Colour, Kenny Wayne Shepherd with an expansive jam on “Voodoo Chile (slight return),” and members of Los Lobos with a sweet rendition of “Little Wing.”
Seeing musicians perform always brings a level of experience that a recording can’t convey. It stirs the senses and brings the audience alive, setting up an environment where fans can engage with the music and with each other. Seeing Hendrix’s music performed live was a unique experience. To see such a good performance of music so timeless and moving, innovative and influential, is rare. Electronic music has evolved into the modern canon, and audience preferences change as music changes, adapting to new forms and sounds. This is to be expected, but — as much as there is great music to be found in every genre and from any decade — this one man’s music stood for so much, and to engage and participate in that legacy spreads its positive spirit.
The music was amazing, but one downside existed to the show. Strict security and the way that the theater partitioned off its seating inhibited people in the the audience from getting into the music. The crowd sat down for the majority of the performance, with only a few people standing to dance. But though not many people stood during the music, everyone stood at the end of each set to give enthusiastic ovations. Other highlights included Vai’s rendition of “May This Be Love,” Cox’s homage to Buddy Miles’ “Them Changes” (Miles played drums with Cox and Hendrix in Band of Gypsys), a short set that featured Vai and Living Colour together performing “Foxy Lady,” “Love of Confusion,” and “Fire” with Vai and Vernon Reid performing blistering duets. Finally, to end the night was Cox, bringing back both Will Calhoun and Layton on the drums at the same time and featuring alternating guitar and lap steel solos on the blues suite “Red House.” The show ended leaving the audience in a charged state, their imaginations and bodies thoroughly stimulated. In the end, besides whose music is being performed or who it’s being performed by, it’s always good to see musicians who work hard to put on a great show.

The month of November has just begun, and this means that National Pomegranate Month is here!
The pomegranate is pretty much the greatest fruit ever. First of all, it looks and tastes awesome. Eating a pomegranate is like getting the chance to experience Mother Nature at her best. She clearly outdid herself compared to her more mediocre works such as Niagara Falls or coral reefs. Second, pomegranates can do wonders for your health. An apple a day keeps the doctor away? Well, a pomegranate a day will supply you with a rich dose of heart-healthy antioxidants, help reduce blood pressure and the risk of blood clots, fight dental plaque, and may help prevent cancer. In some countries, pomegranates are popular because of their ability to prevent wrinkles and improve skin condition — they are estimated to contain an amount of antioxidants that considerably surpasses the amount contained in green tea and red wine. You think it sounds too good to be just a plain old fruit? You’re not alone in that. In fact, the pomegranate is actually categorized as a “superfruit” by the ACAI Health and Nutrition Resource Center because of its exceptional nutritional benefits combined with its unbelievable taste. Let’s see an apple try to compete with that.  
Also, the pomegranate has also historically been acknowleged as a symbol of fertility. It’s basically a red sac filled with an abundance of seeds — that image should speak for itself. With that image in mind, it’s easy to see how the pomegranate is also considered an aphrodisiac. While this is one of the fruit’s more risqué qualities, it is frequently associated with the pomegranate because of its sensual red color and its associated with Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. Did you know that some people believe the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden actually might have been a pomegranate? Eve probably found out about its antioxidants and cancer-preventing qualities and was willing to get kicked out of the Garden of Eden just to get a taste. If you still need more convincing of the sheer awesomeness of this superfruit (as if the term “superfruit” isn’t convincing enough), there was a belief in ancient China that eating a lot of pomegranates could make you immortal. If there was an award for being awesome, looks like Dumbledore would have some serious competition.   
Despite the countless reasons why the pomegranate is the greatest fruit ever, it is true that eating one can be a bit of a hassle. A simple trick to make the process a little smoother is to cut the pomegranate through the rind in several places — without cutting into the seeds — and soak the fruit in a bowl of water for five minutes. This will make it easier to break apart the seeds, and before you know it, your taste buds will be going on a delicious adventure of sweetness with subtle tart undertones. so eating a pomegranate will taste awesome, improve your health with its fantastic nutritional value, make you beautiful by preventing wrinkles because of its overabundance of antioxidants, boost your libido, and might make you immortal. And you thought your iPhone could do it all. 
With your newfound appreciation of pomegranates, you are probably looking for a fun way to celebrate National Pomegranate Month — well, look no further! There is a myth that all pomegranates have exactly 613 seeds, so the next time you get your hands on this amazing fruit, try counting all the seeds!

As I prepare to write this article, my eyes wander to the brilliant swaths of orange, yellow, and blue depicting a sunset over the waters of Venice. While I’m glad that there’s a poster of Claude Monet’s “Saint-Georges Majeur au Crépuscule” in plain sight from my desk, it makes me miss Paris that much more.
My love of Monet and the radical style of impressionism he pioneered motivated me to study abroad the summer after my junior year. Although his work was considered shocking and remained unpopular during his lifetime, he nevertheless continued his efforts to push past the limits of what was comfortable or familiar. It was during his time abroad in Italy that Monet created “Saint-Georges Majeur au Crépuscule,” as well as other beautiful paintings. During this stay in Venice, his wife wrote: “*Monet … a été complètement empoigné par Venise!*” (“Monet ... has been completely gripped by Venice!”). Such a strong statement to describe the effect Monet’s time in Venice had on his life perfectly captures the experience I had during my summer in Paris.
Monet is one of many French artists with whom I have fallen in love. As a child growing up in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., I had access to all the wonderful free museums the District has to offer. Despite such marvels as the sculpture gardens of the Hirshhorn and the Freer and Sackler galleries, I found myself returning to my favorite French pieces — the multimedia ballerinas of Degas, Chagall’s whimsical tapestries, and Rodin’s gnarled sculptures. Although I did not have the financial means to travel overseas as a child, I often dreamed of indulging my museum fix in the City of Lights.
During my time in Paris, in addition to exploring as many museums, art galleries, and sculpture gardens as I could, I took a six-week Language and Civilization course at the Sorbonne University. The class focused on language, phonetics, and various aspects of French civilization. Although the course was incredibly demanding, the professor’s quirky attitude and sincere love of French made the content much more palatable. I still remember cracking up every time he tried to communicate his love of the subjective tense — “It is a beautiful and rare flower, Kelly, not merely a grammatical structure! You must speak French with your heart, not your mind!” Also, I was one of two Americans, which meant that I was able to make plenty of international friends. Some of my favorite moments happened walking around the Quartier Latin after class with my friends, eating delicious crêpes and learning slang words in Polish, Portugese, and Romanian. My closest friend, a chirpy Brazilian photographer, loved making the following joke in my presence: “What do you call someone who speaks two languages? Bilingual. What do you call someone who speaks one language? American!” Much to my consternation, everyone else in the room would immediately burst into uncontrollable fits of laughter. Although I found the anti-American sentiment a tad annoying, it taught me to loosen up and not take myself too seriously. In addition, it spurred me to try my hand at new languages. (Warning: Vietnamese is impossible and Arabic is even harder.)
While I’m on the subject of my linguistic inadequacy, I should probably mention what it was like to immerse myself in an entirely French-speaking culture. I have been learning French in the classroom for nine years, but even so I was unprepared for the difficulty of expressing my thoughts in another language. Unable to fall back on the crutch of my native language, I quickly learned that the less I apologized for my broken French, the faster it would improve. With this in mind, I befriended every Parisian who was patient enough to suffer through my garbled attempts at communication. Not only did my foreign language skills improve dramatically, I developed a sense of what life is like for people our age in Paris — the books they’re reading, the music they listen to, and the extent to which these forms of media act as instruments of social conscience. Instead of reinforcing my preconceived notions of other cultures, study abroad provided me with an in-depth perspective into other countries’ cultures, eliminating stereotypes.
It sounds obnoxious to say that Paris is infinitely better than any other city, but it’s true. Let me rephrase that — it’s true for me. Only in Paris can you walk down the street eating the best pastry of your life, checking out incredible street artwork, laughing at mimes, and flirting with guys who are so well-dressed your gaydar would go off if you were in the States. Paris is my Mecca. Paris is my lifeblood. Paris is my Nutella — no wait, that’s going too far. But all jokes aside, my summer in Paris was one of the best experiences of my life — right up there with skydiving and popping bubble wrap. Not only was I able to eat delicious baguettes every day, I was given the chance to disorient myself geographically, linguistically, and culturally. Only when we branch out of our comfort zones are we able to truly grow. Visiting other countries strips us of our familiar modes of communication and leisure, catalyzing our search for new forms of beauty.
On second thought, I’m glad that a poster of Monet’s “Saint-Georges Majeur au Crépuscule” is hanging right next to my bed, since every morning, when I wake up, I am reminded of how rewarding it was to study abroad. Even though I can’t return to Paris for at least another few years — I blame Carnegie Mellon’s exorbitant tuition and my addiction to adorable shoes — my favorite paintings are even more special to me now that I’ve seen them in person.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I just met this cute girl, but I don’t know anything about her. Do you have any tips on Facebook stalking?
Sincerely,
In pursuit
Dear IP,
True Facebook stalking is an art. It has everything — the thrill of the hunt, the joy of discovery, and the vindication of silently judging someone for what they do in their photos. First off, I’m going to have to assume you have this girl’s first name and the school she goes to. In both cases you want to search for her name and her school as the network. 
Once you get to her page, everything depends on her privacy settings. Many people try to block most things from strangers, but there’s always something that slips through. For example, most people block their photos, but they forget to block photos other people have added. 
Facebook has recently introduced a new tool that makes stalking even easier — “See Friendship.” Is some guy constantly writing on her wall? You can find out by simply clicking “See Friendship.” You can browse photos of the two of them together and see all of their wall posts, and mutual friends. You can see if he’s a competitor or just some creepy stalker.
Don’t send her creepy messages,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
Jon Stewart is like unto a god. How can I convince him to father my child?
Sincerely,
Daily Show girl
Dear DSG,
I see you just got back from the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear. Congratulations: you are one of over 200,000 people in love with Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. Did you make a hilarious sign? I bet it was so funny Jon noticed it all the way from the stage. He’s sure to appreciate you going all the way to D.C. just to profess your love. That’s totally sane.
Sadly, Jon Stewart is happily married, so I don’t think he’ll be able to have your love-child. He may be in need of a mistress, but if he’s anything like some other famous New Yorkers, she’s going to be a prostitute. I can’t “technically” encourage you to be a prostitute because it’s “illegal” and “immoral” and “disgusting.” I’m just saying it wouldn’t hurt your chances. The key is to master the art of his native New Jersey seduction. Learn how to beat the beat and be willing to be punched in the face, à la Snookie. She knows where it’s at.
Pretty sure he’s not gonna cheat on his wife with you,
Brian Hoskins

I’m going to write about a song that I honestly believe should make its way into the lives of every human being. Recently it has been influencing every aspect of my life. 
Let’s go over the progression of this song: Giselle speaks. A piano gently backs her. This is a song of longing. What’s funny is that I’m in no way in a rut of lonely unrequited love. I’m no beautiful damsel dripping in gold, but the song resonates because it captures an emotion so fully. The lyrics are effectively paralleled in the instrumentation, and together they create an image that’s impossible to shake. Tasting the hushed blazes of orange behind plum-speckled clouds, feeling like you’re floating gently through a glowing forest of jellyfish, you are wrapped in Giselle’s words like the gentlest smoke of incense. 
What makes this song such an earworm? I would have to say that it’s due to the simple layered progression of the song. Each layer is simple and memorable and satisfying in its own right. Nevertheless, the song is a gem because whenever a single constituent part of the song is remembered, the rest of it hovers in your mind, gently holding your memory like a lover easing into bed. Despite how memorable each individual piece of the song is, there’s a particular inimitable reverb on Giselle’s voice that makes every listening drip with pleasure.
This is the kind of song that, oddly enough, makes you want to make sure that your mom knows how much you love her and how fortunate you feel for having been raised by her. So, that’s what I’m off to do. By gosh, I’m going to make her proud of this kid she’s brought into this beautiful world! Again, the song is “Crave You (ft. Giselle)” by Flight Facilities. Look it up online. Readers, I promise you’ll love it.
As per usual, if you want to get down with the WRCT sound, check out the following artists and their respective songs: “Duck Sauce” by Barbara Streisand, “El Remolon” by Cumbia Bichera (Tremor Mix), “Minotaur Shock” by The Downs, “Rye Rye” by Sunshine ft. M.I.A., and “This Unfolds” by Four Tet

A dilemma arose this year as no nearby site was available to host the booths and rides that appear at Midway during Spring Carnival. I don’t know how big the Carnegie Mellon budget was in the 1960s, but I’d suggest Kennywood. At least the wooden coasters were relevant then..

A Forum article calls out people who have tiny dogs and carry them in their purses around town, saying that they just buy the dogs for show and not for any emotional reason. Well, that’s silly; I know I like my dogs just how I like my women: small and out of the way.

The 2010 film Gasland was screened in McConomy last Tuesday, followed by a panel discussion. 
Gasland focuses on the current debate over the Marcellus Shale, with special attention paid to the potential health risks posed by hydraulic fracturing, the process by which natural gas is removed from the ground. 
Shale formations have recently been discovered in Europe, Northern Africa, and the northeastern United States. The debate over the Marcellus Shale is especially relevant in Pennsylvania, however, because the state is home to most of the formation. Panelist Wendy Arons, an associate professor in the drama department at Carnegie Mellon, pointed out that “the world will be looking to Harrisburg to pioneer the legislation on the massive reserves of natural gas,” a fact that Gasland’s director, writer, and star, Josh Fox, is certainly aware of.
Fox narrates the film, which begins in May 2008 when he receives a letter from a natural gas company asking to lease his land. While traveling from Pennsylvania to the Four Corners, Fox interviews people who have experienced serious, often life-threatening, complications from nearby hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking.” Fracking involves shooting tens of thousands of gallons of fluids into the ground to loosen gas deposits. Fracking fluids, as they are often called, consist of hundreds of chemicals, a number of which are known carcinogens. A significant portion of Gasland is devoted to investigating fracking fluids. Fox reveals that the complete list of chemicals used in the fluids is protected as a trade secret, a fact that prevents environmental and human health organizations from being able to adequately monitor the impact of fracking. The film’s official website, gaslandthemovie.com, describes the film as “part verite travelogue, part exposé, part mystery, part bluegrass banjo meltdown, part showdown.”
Last week’s event panel featured Arons, as well as Dan Volz and Steven Cleghorn. Volz, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, also serves as the director for the Center for Healthy Environments and Communities and of the Environmental Health Risk Assessment Certificate Program, and he has worked on educating local communities to the potential risks of the Marcellus Shale. 
With his wife, Cleghorn is the co-founder and co-owner of Paradise Gardens and Farm, the first organic farm and licensed goat dairy and creamery in Jefferson County, about two hours northeast of Pittsburgh.Cleghorn first heard of the Marcellus Shale a couple of months ago at a town meeting devoted to discussion of a scheduled well less than a mile from his farm. “All I could think about was our sweet little goats, part of God’s creatures, and decided that I’m not going to let these gas people roll over us, at least not without a fight,” he said. 
Since then, Cleghorn has rallied against drilling in his town, using his local connections and his faith to dissuade neighbors from signing leases. Cleghorn approaches the debate from a perspective that is different from that of many anti-fracking advocates. He strictly avoids mention of global warming — though he expressed his own belief in its validity — and instead relies on his Christian background to convince others not to covet and avoid letting greed take precedence over the well-being of “God’s creatures.” 
On Tuesday, Cleghorn voiced his personal disappointments with the “rapacious nature of these companies” and, in summing up the current climate of rapid technological growth with little or outdated regulations on which Gasland is focused, commented that “unfortunately, in our culture, what is possible becomes mandatory, with respect to technology.” 
Gasland won a number of awards, including a Sundance Film Festival Special Jury Prize, a Big Sky Documentary Film Festival Artistic Vision award, and a Yale Environmental Film Festival Grand Jury Prize. 
A march against fracking by the Marcellus Shale Protest group will begin on Allegheny Landing on the North Shore at noon on Wednesday. More information can be found at www.marcellusprotest.org.

“Ladies and gentlemen, ghosts and children of the state, I am here because I could never get the hang of Time,” reads the first line of “Lighthead’s Guide to the Galaxy,” the first poem in Terrance Hayes’ latest work, Lighthead. This year, the National Book Foundation has chosen Carnegie Mellon’s Hayes, a professor of creative writing, as one of five finalists for the National Book Award in the Poetry Category for this book of poetry. The nominations by the National Book Foundation honor authors who have encouraged the growth of American literature. 
Lighthead’s poems, as described by the National Book Award website, investigate experiences of both dreams and reality within historical, personal, and political stories. They also incorporate cultural personages such as Harriet Tubman and Wallace Stevens, and a Japanese business-presentation style of poetry known as Pecha Kucha. A Pecha Kucha consists of a PowerPoint presentation where people speak alongside images with a time limit of 20 seconds per slide of the PowerPoint. The format originated in Tokyo in 2003 and was created by Astrid Klein and Mark Dytham of Klein-Dytham Architecture.
Of his inspiration for Lighthead, Hayes explained in an e-mail that “our social and cultural landscape often informs, if not infiltrates, my work. For Lighthead, our nation’s wars and tragedies over the last years threw an unavoidable shadow over my usual themes (gender, race, family) and passions (music, literature, art).” Hayes privately began to write poetry in high school and continued through college. Only upon publishing his first book did his family discover his talent. “Even when I wrote in private, I think I was not inspired as much as I was obsessed by ideas and images,” Hayes said. This same “obsession” still often serves as an inspiration for Hayes today. 
Hayes’ previous books of poetry have won numerous other awards, including the Best 100 Books of 2006 by Publisher’s Weekly for Wind in a Box, winner of the National Poetry Series Open Competition for Hip Logic, the Kate Tufts Discovery Award for Muscular Music, and a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, among others. Upon learning of Lighthead’s  recent prestigious nomination, Hayes experienced “absolute joy followed by the absolute terror of having to wear a tux. Since then, I’ve been thinking mostly about how terrific the finalist reading ... will be.” 
Hayes also expressed interest in the other authors’ works that will be presented the night of the reading. 
Reactions across the campus have been positive for the poet, as his works provide a valuable message to students about the value of hard work as well as providing an enjoyable read. Professor Jim Daniels, the undergraduate director and Thomas Stockham Baker Professor of English, first met Hayes at a University of Pittsburgh poetry reading, while Hayes was in the process of completing his MFA. 
“Just from knowing Terrance, taking classes from him, students can see that he’s a regular guy who works hard at what he does, that it’s not some kind of magic that happens. I think they can take inspiration from that in terms of their own writing,” said Daniels. 
Marci Calabretta, a senior in the creative writing department, said, “[Hayes has] stories about meeting nearly every famous poet alive, and his poetry is so chill. It’s inspiring.”

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently awarded Carnegie Mellon the 2010 Green Power Leadership Award for the university’s commitment to purchasing green power.
Green power is the term given to electricity produced from a variety of renewable resources, including wind, solar energy, hydropower, biomass, and geothermal power. Anyone can elect to purchase green power instead of power produced in conventional ways from non-renewable resources. Carnegie Mellon currently purchases the equivalent of 75 percent of its power usage in wind power renewable energy certificates (RECs). While they are as intangible as energy, RECs are tradable energy commodities that represent the positive impact that results from the production of green power. The actual electric current flowing through Carnegie Mellon facilities is connected to the power grid, in all likelihood generated from a local nuclear or coal-burning plant, but the RECs purchased fund green power for other areas.
University Engineer Martin Altschul represented the university at the EPA awards ceremony two weeks ago, where he accepted the award on the university’s behalf. “When people talk about a carbon tax or cap and trade … they are monetizing the harm associated with generating electricity in certain ways,” Altschul said. “When people talk about RECs, they are talking about the reverse — saying there is some environmental benefit by not generating electricity in standard ways and doing it in a way that is more renewable.” 
According to the award ceremony program, the EPA’s criteria for the award included:  “quantity and type of renewable energy purchased, the impact of their green power purchases, the extent to which their actions have helped to establish a precedent that may catalyze similar actions by others, and the extent to which they demonstrated innovative purchasing strategies.” In all, there were 10 award recipients in the Green Power Purchasing category. Among them were BNY Mellon, Intel Corporation, and Carnegie Mellon. 
Carnegie Mellon began investing in the wind power industry in 2001, with its initial purchase of 4,778 megawatt hours, equivalent to 5 percent of its annual electricity needs. This groundbreaking purchase by the university helped establish a market for the energy produced by the newly constructed Mill Run Wind Energy Center, located in Fayette County, Pa.  In 2007, a student petition with over 1,000 signatures circulated, calling for the university to purchase at least half of its energy from local green power sources. By 2008, Carnegie Mellon was purchasing the equivalent of 29 percent of its energy consumption in local energy RECs. 
Altschul cited a “summit of environmental thinkers from around the university” in the fall of 2009, where leaders met to assess the university’s green power purchasing potential. With impetus to increase the university’s renewable energy purchasing percentage, these leaders decided to expand REC purchasing from only local green energy markets to the more competitive national markets. 
“Over time we’ve been able to increase our [REC] purchase because the prices have gone down and because we’ve needed to increase that capacity every time we build a LEED certified building,” Altschul said.
While Carnegie Mellon currently purchases 87 million kilowatt-hours of green power annually, the equivalence of 75 percent of its energy consumption, Altschul divulged that the university expects to increase that purchasing capacity to 100 percent of its energy in 2011.
With several environmental student organizations and eight LEED-certified buildings on campus, many people are affected by Carnegie Mellon’s commitment to the environment. In response to these purchases, Veda Vadyar, a sophomore information systems major said, “What they do in purchasing the green energy is honorable, but they could put more effort into the little things as well. It would be nice to have an on-campus initiative to get students more involved with energy conservation.” 
Civil engineering senior Jenae Pennie said, “I think it gives a positive impression that CMU cares about the environment. Granted, I do not like that this could increase the tuition that students pay — windmills aren’t cheap.  Still, this is an environmentally friendly campus, so overall it’s good.”

Carnegie Mellon President Jared Cohon has been elected chair of the Executive Committee of the Association of American Universities (AAU). Cohon, who had served as vice chairman for the past year, began his one-year appointment on Oct. 19, succeeding Henry Yang, chancellor of University of California Santa Barbara. 
“I am proud to be elected chairman of AAU’s Executive Committee, and I look forward to helping AAU accomplish its mission of support for our leading research universities,” Cohon said in a press release.
Founded in 1900, AAU is a nonprofit advocacy group consisting of 61 U.S. and two Canadian leading research universities. 
“We seek to ensure sustained federal funding of basic research and graduate education and policies that make universities’ efforts on behalf of research and education both graduate and undergraduate, as productive as possible,” said AAU Vice President of Public Affairs Barry Toiv. 
“Part of this effort will be to remind policymakers of the extraordinary economic, health, and national security benefits the partnership between the federal government and research universities has produced for the American people.”
The 61 AAU universities in the United States award more than half of the nation’s doctoral degrees and host 65 percent of postdoctoral fellows.
“Being a part of AAU is a highly sought-after accolade,” Cohon said. “Carnegie Mellon’s invitation to join came about 25 years ago in 1982, reflecting the very rapid rise of Carnegie Mellon from the late ’60s and ’70s.”
“Dr. Cohon has been a leader in AAU for a number of years,” said Toiv. “His most important responsibility will be to help guide the association through what promises to be a very challenging funding and policy environment in the months and probably years ahead.”
The upcoming midterm elections make this year particularly important. “Even if the balance of power doesn’t tip, there will be many new members in Congress, and one of the responsibilities of the chair is to educate these members about the needs of research universities,” said Cohon.  
Since assuming the presidency of Carnegie Mellon in 1997, Cohon has repeatedly demonstrated his capacity to advocate for the interests of research universities.“Here is one recent example,” said Cohon. “There is a government policy that restricts the export of defense or military technologies. That has been on the books for a long time and makes sense … but someone got the idea that the policy should extend to foreign graduate students studying at American universities, that foreign students would actually need to be licensed to get access to a high tech piece of equipment or laboratory.… It was in our view crazy and not workable, but the government was serious about it.”
These proposals would have resulted in serious effects on international students and scholars both at Carnegie Mellon, and across the nation. 
“The proposed recommendations would have had a dramatically adverse impact on the ability of foreign scientists, scholars, and students to be involved in research conducted on campuses in the United States,” said Assistant Vice President for Media Relations Teresa Thomas in a press release.
According to Toiv, Cohon played an important role in convincing the federal government not to impose these rules, explaining to the government officials that they made it very difficult for international students and faculty to engage in critical research on U.S. campuses. 
For this issue, Cohon had the advantage of his experience in the Department of Homeland Security. “On the Advisory Council, issues like export controls would come before us, and I was by virtue of the positions aware of conversations and discussions that were related to this export policy,” said Cohon.
However, Carnegie Mellon has always been the main focus of Cohon’s advocacy efforts. “I’ve tried to make sure AAU presidents and staff were educated about Carnegie Mellon and what an important role we play as a research university in this country,” Cohon said.
And as a president of Carnegie Mellon, Cohon has taken it upon himself to ensure that the university receives recognition for its research. “People tend to tell me how we don’t get as much attention as other universities. Everybody seems to be craving more appreciation,” said Cohon. “I have never met a Carnegie Mellon person who doesn’t feel that Carnegie Mellon is not as well-known as it deserves to be.”
“So at AAU, I have worked to raise Carnegie Mellon’s profile,” Cohon said. “I can’t tell you how the other members of AAU thought of Carnegie Mellon when we joined back in 1982, but I think our standing right now with them is at the highest it has ever been.”
Although Cohon’s appointment and the AAU’s work in general has relatively little impact on Carnegie Mellon’s undergraduate students as a whole, Cohon still hopes that they can appreciate how much more recognition and acclaim Carnegie Mellon has recieved since joining the AAU in 1982. 
“I want undergraduates to think it’s a cool thing for our president to be a leader of all of these universities, and it’s a valuable thing that there is an organization looking out for Carnegie Mellon and other research institutions.… Your university is better known and known in the best way among these very important 63 people,” he said.

When one eighth-grade student in Whitwell, Tenn. raised her hand to say, “Wait a minute, wait a minute, I can’t get my brain around 6 million, it’s too huge,” she had no idea that she was starting something powerful. This student was part of an after-school study group learning about the Holocaust in Whitwell, a homogeneous town of about 1,600 people, nearly all of them white Christians. When the middle-school administration realized that something needed to be added to the curriculum to help students understand those who are different than them, the Holocaust came to mind. 
There are no Jews in Whitwell, but this didn’t stop the middle school students and the community from coming together to collect 6 million paper clips to represent the human tragedy. Joe Fab is the writer, director, and co-producer of the Miramax documentary Paper Clips that captures the extraordinary efforts of this small town. The film and Fab are coming to the University of Pittsburgh’s Public Health Auditorium this Wednesday.
The film offers a different perspective on the Holocaust. “It’s not a period piece, like The Pianist or Schindler’s List and it’s actually not about Jews,” said Mia Jacobs, a sophomore majoring in communication and religious studies at the University of Pittsburgh. Jacobs is also the marketing chair for the Hillel Jewish University Center Student Board. The timing of the film, originally released in 2004, coincides to recognize Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass, during which Jews in Nazi Germany and parts of Austria suffered a series of attacks during November 1938. 
After the screening on Nov. 3, there will be a question-and-answer session with Fab. “It’s kind of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to hear him speak and answer our questions,” Jacobs said. “The Student Board is committed to bringing these opportunities to all students in Pittsburgh.” The event is open to members of the community and has received co-sponsorship from a number of organizations, including Congregation Beth Shalom Men’s Club. 
“This is a special kind of experience we’re going to have,” Fab explained. “When you take time out of your busy day and gather together with other people and sit in the dark and watch a movie and you share that experience — it’s different from sitting and watching it at your house.” 
Fab noted that no matter what age you are, the film challenges you to examine what you’re doing when you see something that’s wrong. “How far do you go?” he asked rhetorically. “Do you just say ‘Oh, gee, that’s really terrible’ and then go to lunch?” He thinks that college students who really ask questions about where they’re heading will be encouraged by the film to make ambitious choices.
The after-school study group in Whitwell was launched in the fall of 1999 with about 25 students, Fab explained. The teachers felt they needed to limit the size, and students were asked to write essays about why they wanted to be a part of the group. As they began learning about the Holocaust and the Nazis, they learned of one of the most important facts: the death of 6 million Jews. Enter the student who didn’t want to move on until she understood what 6 million meant. 
As Fab pointed out, it is known that the number was actually a lot more than 6 million — closer to 11 million. Either way, the number was unfathomable. The students did research to come up with a concrete way to represent the unimaginable. A student came up with the idea of paper clips, not just because of their small size, but because sympathetic Norwegians wore them on their lapels in silent protest during World War II. Thus, the symbol was born. 
But this sequence of events is only captured in three or four minutes of the movie. “After that, it gets really interesting,” Fab said. Carly Adelmann, assistant director of Jewish Student Life at the Hillel JUC, emphasized that the event isn’t just for Jews. “It’s important to remember that it wasn’t just the Jews that perished,” she said. “It’s not just Jewish history, it’s global history.” 
“The story this documentary tells goes a long way to taking what we know about the Holocaust on a conceptual basis and making it real,” said Eric Gottlieb, a sophomore chemistry major and Jewish Affairs committee head for Alpha Epsilon Pi, a Carnegie Mellon fraternity that is also sponsoring the event. 
There is an inspiring idea embedded in the student that put her hand up in a classroom in southeastern Tennessee to try to understand the 6 million. “That child started something in motion, and the reason I will be [in Pittsburgh] on Wednesday night is because of that child in Tennessee in 1999,” Fab said. 
“From that, none of the rest of this would have happened. You don’t know what’s going to come out of Wednesday night. Some student or someone from the community who’s there — this may be what pokes at them and prompts the thought that later has them do something that causes all kinds of wonderful, wonderful effects.” 
The Paper Clips film screening will take place Wednesday at 8:30 p.m., with a Q & A session to follow the film. The screening will take place at the Public Health Auditorium in the Graduate School of Public Health building, which is located at Fifth Avenue and Bouquet Street. This event is free and open to the public.

Professor joins national environmental lecture tour
Carnegie Mellon Professor David Dzombak has been chosen to give a series of lectures focusing on environmental issues for the members of the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP).
Dzombak is the Walter J. Blenko Sr. Professor of Civil and Environmental Education and Research and faculty director of the Steinbrenner Institute for Environmental Education and Research. He is a leader in research in a variety of fields, incluing aquatic chemistry, water-quality engineering, environmental restoration, and the environment and energy. 
The tour is scheduled to visit 18 environmental engineering programs across the country through April 1, 2011. Dzombak will alternate between giving two different lectures specific to his fields of study. The two lectures are titled “Need and Challenge of Alternative Water Sources For Use in Electric Power Production” and “Geologic Sequestration of CO2: Evaluating and Monitoring Seal Rock Integrity.”
“The lecture tour has been very popular because the topics our themed speaker is presenting are so very current and critical to ongoing national debates about energy and water use,” said Sarina Ergas, head of the AEESP lecture series committee and an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of South Florida, in a Carnegie Mellon press release.
Alumna’s 1940s student art portfolio to be displayed
Eleanor Wilson Stoltz, a 1945 Carnegie Tech alumna who has since become a professional artist and educator, plans to share her student portfolio created almost 70 years ago. The exhibition is titled “After Pearl Harbor,” and it will be hosted in Carnegie Mellon’s Ellis Gallery on the third floor of the CFA building Thursday to Saturday. The exhibit is free and open to the public.
Stoltz’s art centers on the World War II time period, when campus life dramatically changed as men enlisted and women dominated the art studios. Artwork from her professional career and some personal artifacts will also be included in the exhibition showcasing the epoch.
A charcoal series from life-drawing classes dated from 1941 to 1943, along with some oil-on-paper portraits, pencil drawings, and other class assignments, comprise her impressive student portfolio.  
Additionally, a collection of metal crafts, tools, photographs, framed artworks, personal objects, and archives on loan from the family will add a historical element to the exhibit. 
Her hand-sewn Carnegie Tech plaid dress will be on display along with a self-portrait. Using selected transcripts of her memories of teachers and their methods, the exhibit will show a personal perspective of history.

Information regarding the lighting design and production to be installed on Hunt Library (“Hunt Library turns 50, receives exterior lighting in celebration,” News, Oct. 25) was incorrect. The final design was created by Cindy Limauro and Christopher Popowich, through their company C & C Lighting. They also co-designed the lighting for the Pausch Bridge, St. Bede’s Church, the miniature railroad exhibit at the Carnegie Science Center, and the Hall of Dinosaurs at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History.

I hate documentaries. I’ve always thought of them as glorified propaganda and don’t typically think they are a good way to find out about things. I know this judgment isn’t fair, but it’s been my experience that people get fanatical when it comes to documentaries. They believe things because they saw them, and they don’t think too much beyond that.
I made an exception to my rule against documentaries, though, for Gasland, which is the story of the Marcellus Shale and hydraulic fracturing. The Marcellus Shale is a rock formation under most of Pennsylvania and parts of New York and West Virginia. It surfaces near Marcellus, N.Y.; hence the name. It is estimated to hold trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. Years ago, the Marcellus Shale wouldn’t have mattered at all because there was no way to get the natural gas out of a shale formation. However, a drilling method known as hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” has changed that. But because the technique is new, not all of the environmental effects of the chemicals used in the process are known, and therefore its use is contentious.
All of this is the background for Josh Fox’s Gasland. Fox owns property in northeast Pennsylvania and was contacted about leasing his land for drilling. He said he wanted to learn more, and that project expanded to become Gasland.
I loved the premise of the movie. I think it’s important to understand where energy comes from, especially considering how current the issue of energy is. I think it’s a noble cause to understand the process of fracking before discrediting it.
In the film, Fox travels across the country getting testimonials of people whose lives have been affected by hydraulic fracturing. He tries to get a gamut of opinions, but is turned down for interviews by all of the major natural gas companies.
But as I watched the film, my problems with documentaries were quick to resurface. It features a series of scenes in which people are able to light their tap water on fire. After researching it, I found that the reasons the water was “flammable” were unrelated to the nearby drilling. Fox kept the footage anyway. This trick works to discredit the rest of the film, even though there don’t seem to be problems with its overall accuracy.
Using a scene that is more extreme than average seems pretty standard for a documentary. Even worse is when Fox reads the chemicals used in fracking fluid. There is nothing factually wrong about this part of the movie. He simply reads a list. The disturbing part of the scene, though, is the way Fox demonizes the chemicals. Carboxymethyl hydroxypropyl guar shouldn’t be inherently scary. If it’s found to be carcinogenic, that is of course a reason for alarm. But all Fox did was to say a lot of chemicals quickly for dramatic effect.
This probably seems like a really small issue, but I watched the film with an audience of Pittsburgh locals who gasped more with the increasing number of syllables, despite having no idea what each chemical does or its side effects. Playing on an audience’s ignorance is not okay.
I loved the idea of Gasland because I thought it would be a good way to educate people about the energy industry — an industry not many people take the time to learn about. Instead, Fox used tricks and played on people’s lack of knowledge for a more dramatic effect.

There has been a rash of incidents this month at colleges across the United States where alcohol put students in the hospital, the most-discussed of which was an incident at Central Washington University where nine students ended up in the hospital. 
The reason these incidents have drawn media attention is because each of them has been linked to the same drink, a product called Four Loko. Created by three Ohio State University alumni, this caffeinated alcoholic drink contains 12 percent alcohol by volume in a 23.5-ounce can. That is, one can contains nearly the same amount of alcohol as a six-pack of beer or five shots of tequila.
But the real issue with Four Loko is not the quantity of alcohol but that this amount of alcohol is mixed with caffeine, packaged in a brightly colored can that looks not dissimilar from Arizona Green Tea, and then sold at a suggested retail price of $2.50. The caffeine delays the feeling of intoxication until well past when the effects of a six-pack would have been felt. For this reason, Four Loko has earned the nickname “blackout in a can.”
While this marketing strategy is obviously successful, as the sudden popularity of Four Loko and other caffeine-alcohol blends has shown, we consider it irresponsible of the manufacturers. Four Loko’s marketing strategy seems to target a demographic that has little money to spend and wants to drink as much as possible — that is, many college students. These students are more likely to abuse the stimulant properties of the caffeine-alcohol mix, leading to a blackout at best or alcohol poisoning at worst.
The dangers of Four Loko and similar products have concerned universities, state attorneys general, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
In response, some colleges and universities have begun to ban Four Loko and similar drinks. We consider this ineffective, as the majority of such bans either have no effect or actively encourage students to break the rules.
Government officials have pushed for a large-scale investigation into the health effects of Four Loko and similar drinks, while the products’ manufacturers have stated consistently that mixing alcohol and caffeine is perfectly safe. Yet anecdotal evidence continues to portray Four Loko drinkers as being unaware of the amount of alcohol they have consumed. Among the other health dangers, this makes them more likely to drive while intoxicated. 
It is the efforts of the FDA that we support. At the least, they should mandate additional warnings for alcohol-stimulant combinations that explain the additional health risks. Such drinks should not be classified the same way as standard beverages like beer or liquor. Only by informing users about the dangers of Four Loko can we avoid more hospitalizations and deaths from its abuse.

After 50 years of existence, Hunt Library has become an important landmark on the Carnegie Mellon campus. It can be seen across the Cut from Forbes Avenue and across the Mall from Doherty and Wean halls. Few students can spend a day on campus without seeing Hunt’s distinctive aluminum façade. The library has therefore become an integral part of Carnegie Mellon, and its appearance reflects on the rest of the campus as well.
In celebration of the library’s milestone birthday, the building will be receiving additional external lighting similar to that on the Randy Pausch Memorial Bridge (see “Hunt Library turns 50, receives exterior lighting in celebration” from the Oct. 25 edition). While the dual purpose of a birthday celebration and increased night lighting is admirable, we still question the process that the university has used while developing these changes.
Changing the appearance of Hunt Library at the request of the Hunt Foundation is tantamount to changing the appearance of campus; in making such an important decision, why was no large-scale student feedback solicited? This new exterior lighting is set to be installed in less than a month, but its appearance is still a mystery to the campus at large. What is it going to look like? What color will the lighting be? How will the lights be arranged? The only clue students have is that the lighting will resemble the LEDs lighting up the Randy Pausch Bridge. And if this is the case, do students really want the view of campus at night to be dominated by a rainbow-colored Hunt Library?
Another important consideration is economic cost. Are the new LED fixtures cost-efficient? While we understand that the Hunt Foundation is providing funds for the new exterior lighting, is the donation — and the money that will be spent on future electricity bills — being put to the best use? Could the Hunts have found a use for their money to help another part of campus? And furthermore, does this new lighting support our transition to a greener campus?
All of these are essential questions to consider, but what’s even more important is making the answers known to the campus community. Changing the face of campus is not a trivial decision, and it definitely should not be done without students having both information and the opportunity to contribute.

This semester I had the choice between taking 15-102 or 15-110. I chose to take 15-110 because I had heard that “Kosbie is great” and “the course is great” — and, after all, Carnegie Mellon is ranked No. 1 in computer science.
More than halfway through the course, I believe it is one of the best I have taken. I was shocked when I read the overwhelmingly negative article published in last week’s edition of The Tartan. This is my response:
“Students who are determined to succeed in the course have been met with consistent obstacles.”
That’s life. People who are determined to succeed meet obstacles. The difference between success and failure is overcoming those obstacles. Everyone wants to succeed given the choice, but it’s impossible for everyone who wants success to achieve it. Imagine a production company with 500 CEOs and no front-line workers.
“No student currently enrolled in this course could say when the next homework assignment will be assigned or due.”
Sunday. It is always due Sunday. There was one exception when Kosbie’s Internet was down due to a thunderstorm. The homework was posted a day late, and students were given a two-day extension.
“Often the homework assignments are posted at random times that are not indicated in class because the professors themselves do not know when the homework will be ready to post.”
Tuesday. It is almost always posted on Tuesday.
“Students are faced with the obstacle of obtaining help.”
Getting help can be somewhat challenging, but I have never had that problem at Carnegie Mellon or in 15-110. If I ever need help in programming, I go to Wean 5201 or one of the Gates clusters any day of the week. I do not keep track of when office hours are scheduled, but I always find two or three course assistants (CAs) in either building.
“Some professors have refused to post their CAs’ hours despite e-mails from students requesting them to do so.... The office hours schedule still has not been posted. This, too, is unacceptable.”
A complete list of office hours for each of the three professors is available straight off the course website.
“Office hours [are] consistently being canceled.”
Office hours are not “consistently” canceled. They are canceled in rare instances when a CA has a personal reason for missing them. I think the author may have been referring to a week when office hours were rescheduled due to extensions on the homework. In this case, the CAs rescheduled their office hours out of good will. If the homework is not due until Tuesday, office hours on Thursday are not much help.
“The course favors those who have some basic knowledge of programming.”
On this point, the author’s outrage is understandable. Imagine if all courses mimicked this style: those who have an understanding of Italian earning As in Italian, and those with less understanding earning lower grades. It is absolutely ridiculous.
“The average amount of time spent on this class exceeds the expected 10 hours.”
Professor Fossati polls the class through online logs to observe the time spent on homework. Interestingly enough, Fossati told students the average time spent on the last homework: fewer than seven hours. Adding in three hours of class per week, the total amount of time spent on this class is slightly less than 10 hours per week.
“The current homework system does not allow for student athletes who travel.”
The homework’s typical format is to explain or develop three to five programs. It does not require that the student be in Pittsburgh while doing so.
“Instructors’ office hours cannot meet the needs of students who have afternoon labs.”
In addition to CA office hours, instructors have office hours three times per week.
“Individual appointments can be few and far between.”
I cannot attend my instructor’s office hours next week. I e-mailed Professor Kosbie, and he made special arrangements to meet with me when I was available.
“Some e-mails slip through the large list.”
Whenever I e-mail the d-list provided by the instructors, the response time is almost always under an hour. Professor Fossati did warn students that if they e-mail only the instructor the day the homework is due, their e-mails may go unanswered.
“The computer science department asked Academic Development to not offer tutoring for the course.”
Kudos to the CS department. Academic Development tutoring can be very confusing in courses where the syllabus changes. Also, the author should note that Academic Development tutors are trained to not provide review of material. They are instructed to teach students how to study effectively.
“Some students are given an unfair advantage.”
All students have the same workload and the same resources to utilize. The author may be referring to the fact that some students are more intelligent than others. Well, this, also, is life. Admittedly, it may seem unfair that intelligent people stand a better chance of succeeding than others, but the CS department has no blame in that. Students attending Carnegie Mellon, a top-tier university, can expect intelligence to be important.
“I believe students are being put in an environment that doesn’t encourage success, but actively prevents it.”
I could not disagree with the author more. I believe she is defining success as an A in the course. It cannot be denied that all students in 15-110 drastically improve their programming capabilities and, most likely, critical thinking and problem-solving skills. I think Professors Fossati and Kosbie work extremely hard to ensure that each student benefits beyond the typical scope of the class. In fact, I have never met an instructor with a passion comparable to Professor Fossati’s.

Tomorrow is Election Day. It is a day when all American citizens share a fundamental right. Millions of dollars in campaign funding and endless commercials and telephone calls all have the single goal of getting individuals to go to the polls and punch, check, or click their ballot. Sheriffs and Senators stand together, their futures subject to the will of the people. On no other day is the electorate’s voice so clearly heard. 
And yet, too often this voice is only an echo of what it should be. Two years ago, voter turnout was estimated at between 62 and 63 percent. If 2006 was any guide, this year’s midterm elections can expect between 35 and 40 percent. How disappointing it is that only a third of American citizens of voting age consider voting worth their time. A third of the Senate, every seat in the House of Representatives, and many governorships and local positions will be decided. The decisions these representatives make will affect more than just that third of the electorate that goes to the polls. If we do not vote, we can hardly be surprised when elected officials do not keep their promises. 
It is for that reason, and many others, that we urge every student registered in Pittsburgh to go vote tomorrow. The Senate race between Republican Pat Toomey and Democrat Joe Sestak is being watched across the country. Current polls show the two candidates in a statistical tie. 
In midterm elections, it is too often the radical fringes that go to the polls, leading to an ever more polarized government. Glenn Beck and MoveOn.org mobilize far-right conservatives and far-left liberals, but the center is underrepresented. When Jon Stewart rallied for sanity, he mobilized a force largely composed of moderate liberals. These moderates and others like them need to show up on Tuesday. It is up to the silent and discounted majority to speak up.

The Oakland Review publishes the best undergraduate writing on our campus. Or so we claim.
Every spring, The Oakland Review, or OR, publishes a journal of undergraduate prose, poetry, and art. The journal has a spine and usually a matte cover with a neat photograph. Our staff distributes it throughout campus, and we hope that people pick it up, read it, and take note of the insert that encourages people to submit next year.
Now, our staff does not boast any math or statistics majors. We don’t track the type of people who submit. We read submissions blindly, which means there are no names on any of the pieces we read.
And yet, we have a sense that the best work isn’t being submitted. Most of our board members are writing majors, and take workshops with some of this university’s most gifted writers. But we’re not seeing those amazing poems or stories or personal essays being submitted to the journal.
Granted, we get some outstanding work. I don’t want to discount anything that OR has published. But I know there’s more out there. I know because I’ve been taking creative writing classes since my freshman year and working on the journal for the same amount of time. There are a lot of great writers on our campus. And they aren’t submitting. I’m not sure why. I can only hazard a few guesses.
Perhaps people see the journal as judgmental — which I can’t argue with, as it is our job to judge the work. Perhaps people are afraid to submit, fearing rejection — another point I can’t argue with, as we have to reject something. Perhaps people aren’t aware of the journal — a legitimate claim, considering our marketing is often limited to art and writing departments.
I just made the perfect case for why students wouldn’t submit. But here’s the catch: The staff is a diverse group of people that’s devoted to creating a literary community at a school that is most prominently known for its technology and fine arts. But we can’t do this unless we receive fantastic work.
In addition to the community that our staff creates, the journal itself creates a community. The names of writers sit in a column on one of the first pages — and while some of the writers have never met each other, there’s something wonderful about the community that’s created within the journal’s pages.
So the next time our submission deadline comes around (usually in mid-February), gather up your courage, dismiss the idea of rejection, and send us your best work.

Don't pig out on chili this Homecoming weekend. Just because you can freely sample all of the different types of chili doesn’t mean you should. Some ingredients just shouldn’t mix together.
Remember that crazy picture you took when you were out of it this past weekend? The one you took with that random stranger that was just standing there but all too willing to be photographed with you? Well, thanks to Facebook, I do too!
Your activities this weekend will make it very difficult to win any more games of "Never Have I Ever."
Fun and games aside, it's time to hunker down and get ready to study, study, study. You will be the most studious, focused student who... I'm sorry, I've been informed that we can't print obvious lies.
You have too many friends that are social, outgoing, and boisterous. What kind of Carnegie Mellon student are you?
It is your job to give our beloved Scotty a makeover. There might not be much to work with, but in order to be ready for the big game you must make people cower in fear when they see Scotty cross their path.
There is a Pisces who tolerates you.
Make sure to suck up and be nice to alumni on campus. The job market stinks right now, and if the difference between a cushy job or cramped cubicle means holding the doors open for a few older Tartans, then so be it.
Oh my, I have lost your horoscope! I had it right here, right under the proper heading and everything. If I remember correctly, it was something along the lines of someone will do something and you will possibly feel happy?
Bring the spirit of a state school to Carnegie Mellon this Homecoming. Grab your friends and paint yourselves plaid.
You survived Halloween last weekend, and this weekend is Homecoming. It’s hard to believe, but there is someone — or rather, something — that misses your attention and feels quite neglected. It’s called your homework.
There is a Libra who loves you.
