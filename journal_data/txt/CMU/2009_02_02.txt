Yesterday, two franchises on different ends of the Super Bowl winning spectrum met in Super Bowl XLIII. The Pittsburgh Steelers won their NFL-record sixth ring at the expense of the Arizona Cardinals’ first Super Bowl appearance.
The Steelers played through a tough schedule in the regular season to gain the number-two seed in the AFC playoffs. After winning two consecutive playoff games at home at Heinz Field against the San Diego Chargers and division-rival Baltimore Ravens, the Steelers earned their seventh trip to the Super Bowl.
Sunday’s opponent, the Arizona Cardinals, has endured two changes in scenery as they moved from Chicago to St. Louis to Arizona. Upon arriving in the West in 1988, the Cardinals enjoyed only two winning seasons in the desert of Glendale, Ariz.
Representing the weak NFC West division, the Cardinals amassed three playoff victories, including a road victory against the Carolina Panthers that came between two playoff home victories against the Atlanta Falcons and the Philadelphia Eagles.
Amid the countless flashes and frenzied fanfare, the Cardinals won the coin toss and deferred the first possession to the Steelers. The Steelers went to work right away as they scored on their first two possessions to go up 10–0, kicker Jeff Reed and running back Gary Russell scoring a field goal and a touchdown, respectively.
The Cardinals answered right away with a touchdown of their own when Kurt Warner threw his first touchdown pass to his tight end Ben Patrick from the 1-yard line.
The turning point in the game occurred during the final play of the first half. The Cardinals had the perfect opportunity to equalize the score, as they drove all the way to the 1-yard line. However, Steelers linebacker, James Harrison, NFL Defensive Player of Year, stepped in front of wide receiver Anquan Boldin to intercept Warner’s pass on the goal line. With no time left on the clock, Harrison returned the ball 100 yards to extend the Pittsburgh lead to 17–7.
After halftime, the Steelers stifled the Cardinals offense yet again as Arizona gave up the ball to the Steelers. With a combination of short pass and running plays, the Steelers were able to take eight and a half minutes off the third-quarter clock to come away with only a field goal by Reed.
Two scoreless drives ensued; the Cardinals regained possession of the football; and the Cardinals’ offense took advantage of this opportunity. With a quick series of no-huddle plays, the Cardinals were able to get a quick touchdown as Warner completed eight consecutive passes, including a touchdown jump-pass to standout wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald in the back corner of the end zone to decrease the deficit to 20–14.
Another two scoreless drives occurred, and the Steelers were pinned inside the 1-yard line. Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was able to execute a brilliant pass to wide receiver Santonio Holmes, but the play turned into a safety as a Steelers lineman was called for holding in the end zone.
The Cardinals answered immediately after the free kick as Arizona’s Warner and Fitzgerald connected for a quick 64-yard pass to take their first lead of the game at 23–20.
In the next possession, the Steelers completed the comeback as Roethlisberger lead the Steelers offense 78 yards to take the final lead of the game.
The drive was highlighted by an athletic and acrobatic catch by Holmes on the side of the end zone. He was able to keep both feet in bounds as he helped his team win their sixth ring as a franchise. The 27–23 final score sent Steelers fans rioting throughout the Pittsburgh streets.

The 20th-ranked Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team finally defeated Emory University on the road despite the Eagles’ home court advantage, a feat that has taken the Tartans 13 years to accomplish. With a Friday game in Atlanta, Ga. against Emory and a Sunday game in Cleveland, Ohio against Case Western Reserve University, the Tartans ended the University Athletic Association (UAA) double header weekend splitting the results. The Tartans came out victorious in the first match-up, defeating the Eagles 60–51 but fell to Case Western Reserve, 67–75, to move their record to 14–4 overall and 4–3 in the UAA.
In the opening minutes Friday, the Eagles gained momentum and their only lead of the game, but Tartans seniors Ryan Einwag and Terrance Bouldin-Johnson thwarted their plans for domination as Einwag put away a lay-in and three-pointer and Bouldin-Johnson sank a jumper to overtake Emory, 7–2. Seniors Rob Pearson and Corey O’Rourke and junior Jack Anderson contributed points on the board to maintain a six-point edge at the half, 30–24.
Coming out of the locker room, Carnegie Mellon amped up its advantage with Anderson putting the final touches on the 12 point streak. Moments later, Eagle Chad Hixon sank nine straight points in just four minutes to close down the Tartans’ lead to 49–47. With Emory on their heels, the Tartans trumped any chance of the opposition pulling through when Einwag finished a three-pointer followed by Bouldin-Johnson’s converted four straight free throws in the final minute to overpower the Eagles and seal the Tartans’ 14th win of the season.
Anderson led the Tartans’ attack with 14 points, followed by Einwag with 12 and Bouldin-Johnson with 10, and O’Rourke tallied nine rebounds to best the opposition.
Unfortunately, the excitement from Friday could not pull the Tartans through to a second away win of the weekend despite jump starting the game against Case Western Reserve with five points in the opening minutes. The Tartans maintained their lead until the 14th mark when a foul throw equalized the score at 12–12 and put the Spartans moving forward to create a five-point edge. The Tartans rallied in the final minutes of the half and hit the lockers with a 34–39 advantage.
Although the team came out strong and put away some points, the game remained tight with buckets coming from both sides. The Tartans began to trail behind in the 13th minute and eventually fell back by seven points. Despite closing the gap slightly in the final minute with an Einwag jumper, Case Western Reserve’s Steve Young and Kevin Herring converted two and four foul throws each in the final seconds of the game to drop the Tartans well behind.
“Shots that we normally hit were coming up short and we were letting guys score that had no business doing it,” said Boudin-Johnson. “Ryan played well and we needed someone to step up and help him. As a senior and captain, it should have been me. I let my team down and I won’t let it happen again.” 
The Tartans play host to the same opposition as last weekend, when they take on Case Western Reserve with an 8 p.m. tip-off on Friday and Emory with a noon start on Sunday at Skibo Gymnasium.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams traveled to Denison University Saturday for the season’s second-to-last dual meet before the University Athletic Association (UAA) and national competitions. The Tartans fell to the hosting Big Reds, with the men trailing behind 176–115 and the women 183–105. This marks the third loss of the season for the Tartans in dual meet action, dropping their record down to 7–3. Despite the loss, the Tartans had impressive swims from senior Tom McConnell and sophomore Molly Evans, both of whom won two events.
“The meet this weekend was all about getting up and racing a team that was faster than us,” said Evans. “They’re a great team, and it was their senior meet, but I think we did a good job competing with them, and some individuals had some really great races. The fact that we were able to challenge their team in a lot of events speaks well for the end of the year.”
On the men’s side, McConnell led the way on the waters hitting the wall in 9:41.31 to secure a first place finish in the 1000-yard freestyle. Carnegie Mellon dominated the 500-yard freestyle, with McConnell leading the sweep (4:45.27), followed by first-year Adam Wagner (5:00.51) and junior Gates Winkler (5.01.91).
With a first-place finish from junior Andrew Seo in the 200-yard breaststroke in a time of 2:13.26, junior Jason Huber (2:16.04) came from behind to place third. The Tartans competitively pushed each other down the lane during the 100-yard butterfly, as junior Scott Moorby touched the wall first, .09 seconds ahead of sophomore Travis Piper, to claim first place with a time of 55.07.
Off the diving board, the men’s and women’s teams took home first-place wins in the 3-meter with junior Matt Kuhn and senior Alex DeFazio securing the event’s domination.
On the women’s side, the 200-yard medley relay team made up of Evans, junior Sara Andrews, and sophomores Rebecca Ussai and Brianne Burton opened up the meet with a strong first-place finish, completing the event in 1:53.25.
Evans then went on to outswim her competitors in the 100-yard backstroke (1:00.08) and led the sweep in the 500-yard freestyle (5:01.28), when she was the first to touch the wall before teammates first-year Victoria Adams (5:22.95) and senior Rebecca Martz (5:36.45). Evans recorded a season-best in the 500-yard freestyle that provisionally qualified her for the NCAA meet.
The women gathered two more first place finishes, one from Andrews in the 200-yard breaststroke to mark a season-best time of 2:33.04, and one from Ussai in the 100-yard butterfly clocking in at 1:02.26.
The Tartans conclude their dual meet season this Saturday at the University of Pittsburgh, with a 11:30 a.m. start. This race is important for those swimmers not competing at UAAs, and therefore this week’s training and rest is integral to the conclusion of their season’s performance.
Looking beyond this weekend, Evans gives insight to the team’s preparations for the UAA and NCAA meets quickly approaching: “With UAAs less than two weeks away, we really start to cut back on the amount of yards we swim in practice and start to concentrate on the meet. I hope this year that we can get a girls relay to NCAAs. We were so close last year and I think we have a good shot. Other than that, I think we have a great chance to swim fast and place well at UAAs.”

Last Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon track and field team continued its indoor season by competing against the Case Western Reserve University’s team in Cleveland, Ohio in a dual match. While the men’s team dominated the opponent with a 79–47 score, the women’s team lost 53–73. There are several reasons to be optimistic about the rest of the indoor and upcoming outdoor season because of the strong performances from the first-year students.
On the men’s team, sophomore Pat O’Brien led the team with a first-place finish (12.83 meters) in the triple jump. In the long jump, sophomore Mike Tomovich jumped 6.18 meters to take second place. Junior Chris Bridgman continued to excel, taking first in the pole vaults with 4.26 meters.
“[Last year] Eric Tang did a lot for the team in all the jumps and sprints. Hopefully between a few of us we can make up for him,” said Tomovich. “I kind of have his performances from last year in the back of my head to try to duplicate them, but that’s no easy task.”
In the sprinting events, senior Brian Harvey dominated and won the 800-meter run with a time of 1:58.47. First-year Rob Morhard followed to take second with a time of 2:01.04. Junior Chris Bogie finished first in the 200-meter dash with a time of 23:29. Seniors Stephano Dubuc (52.36) and Craig Hahn (52.39) both ran well in the 400-meter, finishing first and second, respectively.
In the one mile run, senior Ryan Anderson (4:24.28) and sophomore Nathan Bussiere (4:26.14) took first and second, respectively. Sophomore J.P. Allera (15:31.83) and first-year Matt Jacob (15:44.14) easily finished first and second, respectively in the 5000-meter run.
Junior James Hulley threw for 15.32 meters to finish first in the shot puts while first-year Anthony Hernandez took first in the weight throws with 15.11 meters. The men’s distance medley team (10:31.98) and 4x400-meter relay “A” team (3:29.05) crushed their competition, taking first in both events.
For the women’s team, first-year Chelsea Grindle continued to build on her rookie success, taking first in the triple jump (10.75 meters) and long jump (5.71 meters). First-year Ivana Moses took second in both events with 10.66 meters and 5.01 meters, respectively.
“I’m hoping that with more meets, the more experience I will get jumping indoor so hopefully I’ll continue to progress,” said Grindle.
In the 55-meter hurdles, first-year Luci Laffitte finished first with a time of 9.22 with Grindle close behind with a second-place finish, 9.48. Laffitte also took first in the 200-meter sprint with a time of 28.13.
First-years Marie Doyle (2.89 meters) and Cecily Sunday (2.89 meters) placed first and second in the pole vaults. The women’s distance medley fell short to take second with a time of 13:04.26, but the 4x400-meter relay “A” team performed well to finish first with a time of 4:19.78.
Despite the addition of many new members, the Carnegie Mellon track and field team continues to gel together. “All of the upperclassmen are very supportive,” said Laffitte. “I also really enjoy bonding with the team on bus rides to meets.”
The track and field teams will resume their schedule this upcoming Friday at Slippery Rock University.

As a four-year starter for the women’s basketball team, senior Rachelle Roll has been at the foundation of the program and has seen the team develop over the years. At the height of University Athletic Association (UAA) competition, Roll took time from her busy schedule to talk to The Tartan about her love for sports, the high demand of the architecture curriculum, and climbing the ranks in rebounding, blocks, and points scored for the Tartan team.
Tartan: When did you first start playing basketball? Were you interested in other sports growing up? 
Roll: I first started playing basketball in the fourth grade. Basketball was not always my primary sport. In fact, I spent a majority of my time playing softball for my high school and then during the summer I played on a few traveling teams. We would travel to other states playing in tournaments against really great teams. 
I decided in my senior year not to continue playing softball, which was one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever made. Luckily my great friend Ashley had the girls’ basketball team participate in intramurals and we totally kicked butt on the softball field. 
T: Do you plan to stay involved with the Carnegie Mellon team and the athletics department during your fifth year of architecture? 
R: I do plan on staying very involved with the team next year. I am eligible to play for my fifth year because I qualified for a medical red-shirt my sophomore year due to a shoulder surgery.
T: What interests you most about architecture? If you could build a structure in Pittsburgh, what would it be and where?
R: I think my passion for architecture comes from knowing that something I design can impact and influence many people on a daily basis. The thought of occupying a building that I created is really exciting. 
If I could build something in Pittsburgh, it would have to be a design that benefits from the three rivers and could adapt to its surroundings. Perhaps a night club on a barge that travels up and down the rivers and could dock near the sports arenas for after-game celebrations.
T: How do you balance studio work along with practice and game times during the season? 
R: Balancing studio and basketball is definitely difficult but it’s something that I have gotten much better at. Freshman year was a huge struggle for me, but now I have the hang of balancing the two and it really helps to keep me motivated and prioritized. The architecture professors are normally very receptive to my basketball schedule and trust that I will get my work done.
T: Do you have any hobbies or activities that you like to do during your free time? 
R: I still love to play softball and many other intramurals like volleyball, floor hockey, flag football. In terms of hobbies, I do occasionally paint and sketch to relax, but I think I could have fun doing any type of outdoor activity as well.
T: Are you planning anything fun for spring break or for this summer to take your mind off of the cold winter weather? 
R: I haven’t finalized any of my plans for spring break or summer, however my teammate Lauren [Hirata] mentioned spring break at her place in California, so the colder it gets here, the better that option is looking. In terms of summer, I’m hoping to get an architecture internship in the Philadelphia area to further my experience in landscape or sustainable architecture practice.
T: Are you looking forward to any new movies coming out? 
R: I am not always on top of the most recent movies to come out but I have wanted to see the new James Bond movie, Quantum of Solace, and I also think Gran Torino looks like a great movie.
Next up for the Tartans basketball squads are double-header home games against Case Western Reserve University and Emory University this Friday and Sunday at home in Skibo Gymansium.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team proved to have a disappointing University Athletic Association (UAA) conference double header on the road, after failing to secure a win against the Emory University Eagles in Atlanta, Ga. and then traveling to Cleveland, Ohio to drop a 66–64 decision to Case Western Reserve University on Sunday. The Tartans’ record is 5–13 overall and 0–7 in the UAA.
After a slow start on Friday, the Tartans found themselves down 44–33 at the end of the first half. The Emory defense kept the Tartans from coming anywhere close to tying, with the closest score during the first half at 20–10 with 12 minutes remaining. Carnegie Mellon recovered in the second half, however, and managed to bring the score to 76–73 with six seconds remaining in the game. Unfortunately, a two-point shot at the last second by an Eagles player brought the score to a 73–78 loss for the Tartans.
First-year Jacki Cortese led the Tartans with a game- and career-tying high of 18 points and eight rebounds, while senior Stacie Aleski and first-year Ali Aunkst added 15 each. Senior Rachelle Roll also deserves an honorable mention, with her contribution of 15 points and six rebounds.
Last Sunday, the Tartans faced off against Case Western Reserve University and were robbed of a UAA win when Case Western Reserve scored a basket at the last second to make the score 66–64.
Once again finishing the game as a top scorer, Cortese secured a career-high total of 24 points followed by Aunkst with 17 points and nine rebounds, while Roll added five points and six rebounds. After an intense first half, the Tartans were ahead 33–35 after Aunkst shot a three-pointer. The Tartans constantly fought off the Spartans for the lead, except when Case Western Reserve momentarily went ahead 22–19 with six minutes remaining in the first half. However, the Tartans were not able to maintain the lead for the second half of the game and fell to 40–35 within a few minutes. The Tartans managed to pull together and charged ahead to 46–52 with 11 minutes remaining.
The intense tie continued until a minute left, when the score sat at 62–61. Aunkst and Cortese, with only 40 seconds remaining, added three points to the overall score, while Case Western Reserve shot a two-pointer, tying the score at 64–64. Just when the players could not get any more anxious, a Case Western Reserve forward made a layup with three seconds remaining, finalizing the Spartans’ win, 66–64.
When asked about last week’s performance, sophomore Jessica Buranovsky responded, “It was disappointing to work so hard but to come up with a loss. I think we just work hard to overcome a lot, and since we are a young team, hopefully we can have better results in the future. We play Case again on Friday, and I believe we have an edge over them since we just played them.”
The Tartans will face Case Western Reserve again at home in Skibo Gymnasium on Friday at 6 p.m. and Emory on Sunday at 2 p.m.

The past two weeks yielded nothing but excitement for Melbourne, as the Australian Open, the first annual tournament of the grand slam series, just concluded. The hardcourt tournament took a toll on many players due to the intense heat wave and long matches, which led to many retires from even top players like Novak Djokovic. With over 100° weather and even hotter conditions on the court, this tournament was not only a test of mental skill but also a test of physical endurance.
On the men’s side, Spain native Rafael Nadal took home the trophy with a win over his biggest rival, Swiss-born Roger Federer, in four hours and five long sets, 7–5, 3–6, 7–6(3), 3–6, 6–2. This is Nadal’s first Australian Open win, and his fifth time defeating Federer in a grand slam final. With this win, Nadal keeps his number one ranking in the world standings.
The men’s semifinals brought the only surviving American, ninth ranked Andy Roddick, against second-in-the-world ranked Federer. Federer easily breezed past Roddick in straight sets, 6–2, 7–5, 7–5, bringing his record against Roddick to 16–2.
In the other half, Nadal faced fellow Spaniard seventh seeded Fernando Verdasco. The two Spaniards ground out five sets, each refusing to give in, resulting in a five-hour-and-15-minute match. Nadal finally triumphed when Verdasco double faulted on match point.
The women’s final last Friday was not nearly as long, but just as exciting, as the United States’ second-seeded Serena Williams crushed third-seed Russia’s Dinara Safina 6–0, 6–3 in a mere 59 minutes. This is Williams’ fourth Australian Open win and 10th grand slam title.
In the first women’s semi-final match, Safina faced off against fellow Russian, seventh-seeded Vera Zvonareva, eventually winning 6–3, 7–6(4). For the second semi-final, fourth seeded Russian Elena Dementieva faced Williams but fell in straight sets, 6–3, 6–4.
In the bottom half of the draw of the quarterfinals, Williams faced eighth seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia, 5–7, 7–5, 6–1. After being down 5–4 in the second set, Williams pulled herself together to win 7–5, and gained enough momentum to crush Kuznetsova in the third set in thirty minutes.
The doubles portion of the open led to an all-sibling teams’ wins. For the men’s doubles tournament, second-seeded American brothers Bob and Mike Bryan took home the trophy with a win over India’s Mahesh Bhupathi and Bahamas’ Mark Knowles, 2–6, 7–5, 6–0. Venus Williams and sister Serena took home a decisive win 6–3, 6–3 over Slovakia’s Daniela Hantuchova and Japan’s Ai Sugiyama.
The next grand slam tournament will be the French Open held in Paris, France on clay courts.

The term “robotics” brings to mind visions of probes that zoom up to the sky and land on the rocky surface of the moon. Carnegie Mellon, however, has introduced a robot of a different kind: one that lands on the slick surface of the heart. HeartLander, barely the size of a finger, is being developed by Cameron Riviere, an associate research professor at the Robotis Institute, and is capable of revolutionizing the way cardiac surgery is done today. 
HeartLander’s capabilities are enormous. It can literally “walk” on the heart, allowing surgeons to reach previously inaccessible parts of the heart. It can also inject medications into the muscle of the heart, place pacing electrodes on the surface, and even selectively destroy malfunctioning tissue. Perhaps the best part about the device is that it requires only minimally invasive surgery. 
Patients being treated with HeartLander need no more than some local anesthesia and a few minutes of their time to get treated for something that presently requires at least an overnight hospital stay. “You could potentially do outpatient procedures with [HeartLander]. That’s the sort of the thing that the surgeons get excited about,” Riviere said.
Initially, Riviere and his team had a hard time getting HeartLander to move along the heart. Riviere explained that the current prototype of HeartLander uses suction cups to move around the heart. It has one front foot and one back foot that are connected to each other by flexible wires and can hold on to the surface of the heart with the suction cups. 
If the suction of the back foot is on, the back foot remains stationary and the front foot can be pushed forward by the wires. For the device to move forward, the front foot is kept stationary with suction pads and the back foot is pulled by the wires up to the front foot. “You can do that in a cycle and get this kind of inchworm motion,” Riviere explained.
Although this seems simple in theory, the reality is not so simple. The surface of the heart is wet and slippery, making it hard for the suction cups to hold on. The suction also cannot be increased beyond a certain degree for fear of causing damage to the heart. When Riviere first tested the device on pigs’ hearts, the device just kept slipping and was not able to move around much. Riviere and his team spent a couple of years trying to solve this problem. “All of a sudden this one prototype we built — boom — it [worked] ... [but getting the device to move properly] was really the big challenge.” With the locomotion technique in place, HeartLander was all set to do wonders on the surgical table.
To fully realize the potential of HeartLander, Riviere started working with Marco Zenati, a professor of surgery at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and adjunct professor at the Robotics Institute. As stated in an article on CarnegieMellonToday.com, Zenati is known for performing the first robot-assisted beating-heart coronary bypass surgery in the country. 
With this background, Zenati was definitely able to understand the importance of HeartLander for cardiac surgeries. “[HeartLander] is unique because it qualifies as an organ-mounted robot. So HeartLander actually adheres to the surface of the beating heart. 
All the other robots are mounted on a platform, not on the heart itself,” Zenati said. He explained that this feature of the robot allows it to access nearly all parts of the heart, opening the door to a number of opportunities. 
This novel characteristic of being able to move around the entire surface of the heart allows HeartLander to provide a different and safer approach to the way surgeries are done. Riviere explained that to get HeartLander on the heart, the surgeon would have to make an incision just below the sternum — the breastbone located at the center of the chest — and place HeartLander on the apex of the heart. HeartLander could then move wherever the surgeon wanted it to go. 
Today, the area that allows surgeons to have maximum access to the heart is the space lying below the left lung. Heart surgeries therefore call for the deflation of the left lung. This procedure has a number of drawbacks, including the aforementioned drawback of having to administer general anesthesia, which necessitates an overnight hospital stay. “One of the benefits of HeartLander is that because it is highly flexible and it can crawl wherever you want it to go, you just need an incision in the pericardial sac, but it no longer matters where that incision is; as long as you have one, you can get in,” Riviere explained. 
As of now, HeartLander has been tested only on pigs. Before they test it on humans, the team is adding more features to HeartLander to make it even better than what it already is. “[We want] to integrate HeartLander with a navigation system to create a virtual reality environment where the heart will be represented on a three-dimensional matrix [along with] HeartLander. We can basically use this virtual environment to provide model-guided planning and therapy,” Zenati said.

Imagine a house standing peacefully in a locale where nothing extraordinary seems to happen, and the next minute the house is lying in ruins in a deep hole 200 feet in the earth. 
This type of natural occurrence is called a sinkhole, which swallows everything above it and leaves behind a gaping hole in the earth. Sinkholes are caused when the soil underneath the surface is hollowed out, leaving no support for the above-ground structures. There are three layers of substance that support a structure like a house. 
There is the topmost layer of soil, ranging anywhere from a couple feet to hundreds of feet thick, followed by a solid layer of rock, usually composed of evaporite or carbonate types of rock. Evaporite rock is formed after minerals from above-ground water precipitate and collect below, and carbonate rock is formed mostly of minerals containing the carbonate group. The most common examples of such rocks are limestone and dolomite. 
These types of rock are the most prone to dissolve with constant water contact. Over time, if there is water flow over the rock layer due to groundwater pumping or activities caused by ponds or basins, erosion will occur, forming a hollow void in the rock layer.
The soil from the topmost layer travels into the caverns formed in the rock layer below, leaving a void in the soil layer above. Eventually, enough soil will travel into the void, so there is a hollow arch in the soil layer. When the soil support wears too thin, the surface above will collapse into the hollow space where the soil previously was, and a sinkhole is formed. 
Sinkholes are often undetectable and are formed suddenly since the soil on the topmost layer stays intact as long as it has support from the rock below it, but as soon as it loses this support, the soil collapses. According to the Department of Environmental Protection of Pennsylvania, other causes for sinkholes include soil removal, drilling, vibration from traffic, or concentrated water flow, such as stormwater drains or leaky sewage pipes. Thus, human activity could be responsible for forming sinkholes.
However, the most effective way of triggering a sinkhole is by pumping materials underground. Any disturbance of either the underground water or soil can place stresses on parts of partially developed sinkholes. Any change in the hydraulic system, a change in the amount of water underneath the ground or change in soil, could possibly induce a sinkhole. The water and soil support each other and thus keep the surface stable, but a change in that equilibrium will cause a change in the ground below.
A more mild form of this natural disaster is called dissolution, where instead of the ground collapsing, a slight depression in the ground is formed to create a pond or other water collection site.
Common signs of sinkholes include cracks in the ceiling or walls, windows or buildings, the inability to properly close a door or window because of misalignment, or cracks or depressions in the ground. According to ga.water.usgs.gov, the most common states where sinkholes occur are Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania. However, out of all these states, the most sinkhole-susceptible state is Florida. 
Much of its peninsula is composed of sand and clay deposits, so water erosion of the rock underneath is higher in Florida than in any other state. One of the biggest, natural sinkholes recorded is the Qattara Depression near Cairo, Egypt. This desert sinkhole is 75 miles long, 50 miles wide, 436 feet deep, and composed of nearly all quicksand. 
Currently, scientists want to fill the sinkhole completely with water to create a body of water that would, according to webecoist.com, rival Lake Erie and would give the Qattara region complete energy independence. A sinkhole with a semi-happy ending is The Devil’s Sinkhole, where after it opened under a street in Texas, people found ancient Native American artifacts and trinkets.
Another unusual example of this natural disaster is the Berezniki sinkhole in Russia, which is 656 feet deep and grows deeper every year. The Sarisarinama sinkholes in Venezuela are nearly 1000 feet wide and deep and are perfect circles. What is unique about them is that they contain numerous ecosystems that are found only inside the sinkholes. 
Another interesting type of sinkhole is called a “Cenote.” Cenotes are sinkholes filled with water that are connected to a number of underwater tunnels and caves. Cenotes thus form beautiful spots for swimming and have become great tourist attractions. The Bimmah cenote in Oman and the Mount Gambier cenote in Australia have become particularly famous as tourist spots.

For most young people in the world, aging is not something they worry about. In fact, children cannot wait to grow older. For a handful of children, however, aging is a process that comes too quickly.
Progeria is a devastating disease that quickly destroys childhood fantasies of everlasting youth. Instead of aging at a normal rate, children with progeria age eight times as fast as a normal human being. Mentally, however, the child matures normally. The consequences are unsettling — a child who is only 10 physically resembles an 80-year-old adult. Progeria is a case of a young mind trapped in an old body. Unfortunately, as of now, a cure for this disease does not exist; while symptoms can be treated and surgery can relieve complications, those afflicted with this disease rarely live past 13.
As humans naturally become old, conditions that are commonly associated with the elderly develop: baldness, heart problems, joint stiffness, and even hip dislocations. These symptoms manifest themselves in children who have progeria. Often times, they will appear as early as the first year of life. In addition, the physical development of such children is drastically different from that of normal children: babies with progeria have aged skin and a smaller face and jaw relative to head size than babies without the disease. 
The bodies of children with progeria are smaller and more fragile than those of other children, and their eyebrows and eyelashes fall out. Ultimately, cardiovascular complications in children with progeria cause a heart attack or stroke. While there have been cases of progeria patients living to 30 years, the lifespan of a normal patient is around 13 years. Progeria is an extremely rare disease, with fewer than 50 cases known worldwide. It is a genetic disease that is caused by just a single misplaced letter in the DNA code. The mutation in the LMNA gene results in the production of a faulty form of a protein called the Lamin A protein. This protein is responsible for holding the nuclei of the cells of the body together and defects in this protein cause the nuclei to become weaker. Studies have also shown that the mutation appears in human sperm before conception, and not during the development of the child. As of now, a satisfactory cure for the disease does not exist. Further research is being carried out in hopes that a cure will be found. Research is also being carried out in hopes of gaining more insight on normal human aging.
Even if there is no cure, there are ways to make life easier. Hayley Okines is an 11-year-old girl in the UK who suffers from progeria. Hayley’s story, reported in a number of news articles including some in BBC News, shows that living a nearly normal life is not impossible for such children. Like any normal child, she attends school and has a group of friends. Unlike any normal child, however, she must take a hydrotherapy session every week to delay the advent of arthritis. Children like Hayley must also take health supplements in the form of vitamins and drink mixes because their appetite is smaller than that of a normal child. 
To prevent the breakdown of tissues, vitamin E can be taken to combat free radicals that destroy cells. Aspirin is another supplement that can be taken to prevent heart disease. Because facial development is different in progeria patients, the faces of such children are smaller and more irregular than normal, and their teeth suffer from wear. To prevent tooth decay, they can take fluoride to strengthen their tooth enamel. Studies in progeria will have long-lasting consequences. While the primary goal is finding a cure for the disease, progeria research may yield a greater understanding of the causes of aging. In addition, it could provide insight into cardiovascular disease. Since cardiovascular disease affects an increasing number of people, more research in this field could help millions around the world.

Mercury found in common sweetener
High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), an artificial sweetener, has replaced sucrose (cane sugar) in soft drink production due to its lower cost and longer shelf life.
A recent article published in Environmental Health reports that of 20 samples of HFCS taken from three manufacturers, nine contained detectable amounts of mercury. 
Two manufacturers were responsible for eight of the nine mercury-positive results. According to the authors of the report, the presence of mercury indicates the use of outdated methods in the refining process, and no amount of mercury in food products should be acceptable.

NFL players prone to brain disease
Six deceased NFL players have been diagnosed post-mortem with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, arising from the multiple concussions that the players suffered on the field. 
The six players tested were all between the ages of 36 and 50. CTE is a degenerative brain condition that is correlated with the onset of dementia in late middle age.
NFL players have all been made aware of the risks of multiple concussions and the importance of proper treatment.

Salt intake levels under scrutiny
Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, commissioner of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene of New York City, who pushed in years past for restaurants to publish calorie counts on their menus and to not cook meals using trans fats, is now targeting salt. 
Frieden claims that Americans ingest an unhealthy amount of salt, more than 80 percent of which can be traced back to packaged foods and meals prepared in restaurants.
Frieden has also claimed that today, Americans have become accustomed to large amounts of salt in meals, and that central to his strategy is a gradual reduction. 
He adds that lower sodium levels in food will lead to immediate improvement in public health.

FDA allows stem cell trials in humans
In spite of policies set early during the Bush administration limiting the types of human embryonic stem cell research that could be funded federally, the FDA has cleared trials beginning this summer for stem cell treatment on patients suffering from complete spinal cord injuries. 
A complete spinal cord injury entails complete loss of motor and sensory function below the point of injury. The California-based Geron Corporation has been developing the techniques for stem cell treatment and training personnel under its own funding. It applied for approval last March, but received it only recently. Thomas Okarma, president and CEO of the Geron Corporation, says that the trials will establish whether it is safe to inject patients with precursors of nerve cells, called oligodendrocytes. They will also be monitoring the patients for increase in function under the point of injury.

Theory explains global warming
John Sternman, a professor of management at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, is devising tools to help political leaders understand the nature of problems plaguing the nation. Recently, Sternman decided to focus his work on the climate in order to make political leaders, such as President Obama, understand the severity of the global warming problem our world faces.
Sternman, in his policy forum paper in a recent issue of  the Science magazine, uses the idea of the “Bathtub Effect” to explain the underlying problem behind the greenhouse effect. He explains that the atmosphere is like a bathtub with a partially opened drain. Carbon dioxide from various sources, such as burning fuels, forest fires, and car emissions, is pouring into the bathtub twice as fast as the tub can drain it. The result is a clogged drain that will eventually begin to flood.

Super Bowl ad is featured in 3D
A joint venture between Dreamworks and Pepsi has resulted in the creation of the first ad ever aired in 3D during a Super Bowl game. The commercial promoted Dreamworks Animation’s upcoming movie Monsters vs. Aliens. The ad, which is 90 seconds long, took the creators four and a half years to make. Dreamworks built its own authoring software and hardware for the ad. The movie makers also rigged a video camera that enables the director to move through a virtual scene in real time. This allows the director to decide how to use the z-axis, which adds a third dimension to film, when shooting scenes.

Scientists find Milky Way’s twin galaxy
Astronomers from the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias in Spain have been able to view the heart of a nearby galaxy known as NGC 253, or the Sculptor Galaxy. Using an instrument on the Very Large Telescope, astronomers were able to witness clusters of light packed around the core of the galaxy. These observations indicate that a supermassive black hole similar to the one in our galaxy (known as Sagittarius A*) exists. Scientists conclude that the existence of this black hole confirms that the Sculptor Galaxy is in fact a twin of the Milky Way galaxy.

Scientists make car parts from coconuts
A team at Baylor University has discovered a way to use the outer husks of coconuts to make car interiors, floorboards, and trunk liners. The fibers are blended with polypropylene fibers, and are then molded in different shapes. The material has proven to be just as good, if not better, than current materials used to make automotive parts. Walter Bradley, the engineer leading this team, believes that using coconuts as a substitute for the synthetic polyester fibers typically used has the potential to benefit the world at many different levels. 
The husks do not burn well or give off toxic fumes, enabling them to pass the tests required for use in automotive parts. In addition, using coconuts would create a huge market for countries like the Philippines, India, and Indonesia, where coconuts are an abundant, renewable resource.

This year’s “Playground: A Festival of Independent Student Work” kicked off with a spectacular light show, complete with thundering sound effects and a Skype video conference with Dick Block, associate head of the School of Drama and one of the creators of the Playground program.
Thursday night marked the sixth year of this annual festival, and drama students were overjoyed to relish in all of their hard work.
Many performers from last year returned with new editions of their pieces, such as Nick Ducassi, a junior musical theater major. He performed his one-man show,  (XY)Z: X-amine Your Zipper, which explored the definition of a man and his role in social society. Opening with words from the popular Bob Dylan song “Blowin’ in the Wind,” Ducassi discussed situations involving men, sex, love, homosexuality, family, childhood, and the question of manhood.
In the intimate setting of the Rauh Studio Theater, Ducassi switched between the roles of narrator and “monster,” which could have been interpreted as a troubled man’s subconscious thoughts. Oretha Manu, a sophomore global environmental public policy self-major, was really moved by Ducassi’s piece. “I really enjoyed Nick’s piece because he really tried to reach every view of what a man goes through, or what a man can be. He covered the stereotypes, and he went beyond them,” she said. At the end of his performance, Ducassi received a standing ovation from the majority of the audience.
Another highly praised performance was directed by Gabrielle McClinton, a sophomore musical theater major, who brought Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992 to the Chosky Theater. Written by Anna Deveare Smith, Pulitzer Prize and two-time Tony award nominee, the documentary theater piece portrays reactions to the Los Angeles riots of 1992. The four policemen arrested for beating Rodney King were found not guilty, and testimonies from a lawyer, an anonymous jury member, a civil rights activist, a real estate agent, and others, were performed by an all-female cast.
“I really liked Twilight,” said Josh Wilder, a first-year acting major. “Each individual performance was really powerful.”
Wilder also enjoyed the comedy Thursday Night Live, a School of Drama version of Saturday Night Live, complete with a live band and a musical performance by Ben Ferguson and the Weshlerettes. The opening segment featured an actor impersonating Peter Cooke, head of the School of Drama, down to his Australian accent. Cooke joined the actor on stage, participated in the skit, and then they both announced “Welcome to Thursday Night Live!”
The show featured a parody of the Twilight book series with three teenage girls fawning over “Mist,” the perfect guy, meaning he was a vampire. After one girl has been drained of her blood, the other two eagerly await their turn. Mist looked quizzically at the teen girls and explained that it’s not “wonderful” to be bitten by a vampire. He grabs a girl’s wrist, starts biting into it, and as she screams he says, “See? It hurts!” only to have the girl respond, “Do it again.”
Other spoofs included The Private Lives of Bible Characters, and a skit with the killer from No Country for Old Men as a birthday party entertainer.
“That was the funniest thing I’d seen all day,” said Wilder.
The Playground performances truly appealed to a wide range of people. With thought-provoking, confusing, comedic, and musical pieces, there was something for everyone.
Perhaps most indicative of Playground’s appeal to students, regardless of their major, was the performance of Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog on Friday.
Students from majors as far removed from drama as computer science, engineering, and physics poured into the Chosky Theater, filling nearly all of the seats available. A molecule was projected onto the curtain as audience members discussed excitedly what the show might be like, or how they hoped the actors might carry out their roles. 
Then again, therein lies the beauty of the show. Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog has gained something of a near cult-like status among its fans since it debuted on the Internet scene over the summer. People sing and hum songs from its score to class, grinning as they do, and watch the movie online or on DVD.
However, part of what makes Dr. Horrible such a unique production is that it is a musical, as implied from its title. It boasts of having the most well-known song about freeze rays on Earth, or perhaps in the history of musical theater, as well as engaging characters and a plot that viewers can’t help but get sucked into.
When the theme music played, a cheer swept through the audience. People waited in their seats, leaning forward in anticipation as the curtain rose and the production began. Dr. Horrible himself came out, clad in plain clothes and wearing a Carnegie Mellon T-shirt. “I have a Ph.D. in horribleness!” he said, gesturing to the school’s logo, as the audience couldn’t help but laugh and applaud madly.
On the whole, the staging was superb. While doing scenes from a blog might seem easy to adapt to stage, Dr. Horrible presented some interesting challenges that the cast and crew handled very well. For example, at one point it was necessary to change scenes from a laundromat to the doctor’s lair. Thanks to some nifty backgrounds and the help of supporting characters, scene changes were not only smooth, but also fun for the audience to watch. During one of the musical numbers, a band of homeless people ran off with the table that, moments before, Captain Hammer and Penny had been using to dine at. The audience loved it, rolling with laughter as the play moved seamlessly on.
The cast and crew also accurately predicted how the audience would react. While they wanted people to be quiet for most of the songs in the show, there were times when the audience was invited and encouraged to break into song. At one point, a row of people started to do the wave, and soon enough, all of the audience was following.
The production’s success, on so many fronts, was an example that hard work, attention to detail, and knowing one’s audience pay off. By the end, the audience was up in arms, clapping and applauding, some even calling out, “Commentary!” in hopes that the cast would return for an encore performance.“It was excellent,” commented Matthew Doncheski, a sophomore mechanical engineering major. “The guy who was playing Captain Hammer really nailed it.”
Sure enough, long after the production was over, people were still talking about it, comparing how each character was portrayed, and how similar to the actual movie it was. Some of the actors were excellent, including the one lovingly referred to as “Raunchy Penny,” while others needed to watch the original a few times more.
Playground continued, going into a three-person play about a troubled marriage called Minor Variances. With minimal props and a cast that was extremely absorbed in their roles, the play was enticing, leaving the audience wondering about what was truth and what was fiction.
The performances of Friday night were also held in high esteem.
The last day of Playground included a few unconventional pieces. Tina Robinson’s Anomalous Voice explored the consequences of technology determining who deserves government aid. Six different people were asked to sit in the True Voice Indicator (TVI). The TVI would analyze the person’s voice and thereby determine the race and socioeconomic status of the person, and report the amount of government aid he or she would receive. This piece was mentally stimulating, combining themes of race relations, the challenges of differing socioeconomic classes, and stereotypes.
At 5:05 p.m. performers of Hearing is the Last to Go... asked the audience members to lie down on mats that had been spread out on the stage floor. Participants were blindfolded, and bombarded with a multitude of orchestrated sounds and words, such as names of colors, and dialogue. Every now and then a narrator’s voice could be heard, but the narration was not always coherent or rational. Occasionally, actors would shine lights on the blindfolded eyes of participants and run around their bodies, creating chaos.
Basically Bourdoir featured musical selections related to bedroom and night-time activities. One singer announced the show as “the opening act for Under the Covers,” which was the final show of Playground.
A concert featuring drama students acting as Danity Kane, Britney Spears, Prince, and other famous entertainers celebrated the end of another year of Playground. Several performances featured lip-syncing to music coordinated with complicated choreography, and a few not-so-spectacular acts. Ryah Nixon and Mathanee Stefan Treco, both senior drama majors, gave stellar singing performances as Jessica Simpson and Prince, respectively.
School of Drama students crowded the front rows as the concert was coming to an end.
Playground has proven itself to be not only a showcase for a myriad of student talent, but also a vehicle for bringing students from different backgrounds and majors together to enjoy good plays and great acting.

I am usually a complete wreck when it comes to flying. Yet any fear brought on by the intense turbulence as the plane landed at the Florence Airport was mitigated by the stunning view out of the window: the Tuscan sun pouring onto the green checkered landscape, and the hillsides peppered with the brick red roofs of the Florentine houses.
Perhaps this bumpy landing serves as a microcosm for my first month here studying abroad, as well as the country as a whole. Italy is disorganized, rather imprudent, and more foreign than the tourist guidebooks make it out to be. Yet, all this ugliness is completely forgotten, or rather masked, by the utter beauty of the fashion, food, art, and landscape.
It is impossible as a woman to walk down the street without being propositioned by the men standing like vultures outside of the cafés and tabacchis, or tobacco shops. As Tobias Jones noted in his book, The Dark Heart of Italy: “Italy is the country that feminism forgot.” The female anchors on Italian news channels wear stylish suits sans any undershirt, with cleavage fully exposed as they speak in rapid Italian about world events. Italy’s version of The Late Show with David Letterman always commences with two Italian dancers dressed in thong bikini bathing suits, as the host stands, mouth agape. After their performance, he often gives them a complimentary slap on the bottom. These programs come on the television when I’m at the dinner table having supper with my home stay Italian “parents.” At times, I’ve shoveled pasta into my mouth just to avoid making eye contact with my Italian father, “Babbo,” as the camera zooms in on various parts of the dancers’ bodies.
And yet after many a night with the TV blaring, I began to realize that sex is just another part of the beauty of Italy. The cries of “Ciao, bella!” from men on the streets, as well as the image of scantily dressed anchors delivering news of Barack Obama’s inauguration, are just as much a part of the beauty and aesthetic of Italy as is Brunelleschi’s Duomo dome or the marbled façade of the Basilica di Santa Croce.
Even the disorganization of everyday life here has some beauty hidden within. In the middle of the afternoon, when most Italians take their version of a siesta, the cafés, called bars here, become busy with the clinking cups of waiters serving cappuccinos and “caffé correttos,” an espresso “corrected” with a bit of alcohol, to the waiting patrons. There is no orderly line like at Starbucks, no barista who writes your name on the side of your paper cup and makes your drink in the correct order in which you were received. Rather, after pushing your way through the crowd, as Italians do not believe in lines, you are handed a coffee the size of a shot glass to drink at the crowded bar. Although it is possible to sit, most of the time people take their coffee standing up, for sitting at a table means paying an additional fee for service. At first, this congestion — and constant standing — made me miss the American way of a coffee break: Why couldn’t I resign myself to an afternoon hanging out in a warm place with a gigantic latte, sitting in a big comfy arm chair for four hours and using wireless internet, a la Kiva Han on Craig Street? But, slowly, I began to realize that the beauty behind the shops and restaurants here is that they are meeting places just for coffee or lunch; a place for one to truly enjoy every sip of their thimbleful of a hot beverage, and to talk with friends. “Hanging out” is done at home.
Because the home is where Italians spend most of their time, I have begun to embrace my home stay family as my parents-away-from-home. The stereotype that Italian mothers are overprotective has not been reversed in my experience. Although I have yet to be reprimanded by my Italian mama, my roommate with whom I share a loft has been asked to put on a longer coat at night for purposes of discretion, as well as to dry her hair before sitting down to dinner — Italians are afraid of the cold, yet they keep their apartments at a frigid temperature. I have not been a perfect child myself. Upon using an American blow dryer with an Italian converter, I managed to blow out the fuse for the entire apartment, forcing my “parents” to walk down and up the six flights of stairs to the basement of the no-elevator building to reset the circuit box. It turns out that no two major electronic devices can be used at once in Italian homes to preserve electricity. I had been blow-drying my hair at the same time the microwave was on.
As I am living with an Italian family about half an hour outside of the city center of Florence, I have begun to feel much less like a tourist and more like a local. My experience sleeping, eating, and living with a family that speaks no English has forced me to embrace not only the language, but also the culture of Italy: the good with the bad. While Frommer’s travel guide may have forgotten to tell me that the disorganized national airline, Alitalia, would lose my baggage for two days, and no one would answer the telephone at baggage claim at the airport, the beauty of the place where I am currently living erases all pessimism from my mind. Italia, in all of its beautiful chaos, is my home away from home.

College life is not easy, but what’s even harder is eating healthy while there. When pressures and responsibilities pile on, we tend to spoil ourselves with food, more specifically, with comfort food. Most of the food we eat is processed food, high in carbohydrate and with low nutrition value. From bagels and coffee (with all the extra sugar) in the morning to sandwiches and greasy Chinese food in the evening, it seems like we failed health class.
A healthy diet is a part of healthy living. It’s a lifestyle, not a diet program.
Slightly modifying your everyday diet is easier than you think. First, you need to figure out which foods are healthier than others. You should look for unprocessed food, or food that is minimally modified from its original form. Choose fresh fruit over chips, juice over soda, and multigrain bread over white bread. Overall, you should try and maximize the amount of fruits and vegetables in your diet. Of course, the healthier alternatives are not always the most appealing, but with some effort, you can eat better.
Food on campus is heavy in carbohydrates, but here are some quick tips to make choosing what to eat much easier. Instead of coffee, tea can provide a healthier dose of eye-opening caffeine. From La Prima Espresso in Wean Hall to Ginger’s Deli in Tepper, you can select from a wide variety of tea. Adding milk, preferably non-fat, to your Earl Grey, Awake, or Darjeeling tea will soften the flavor and aroma of the tea. Green tea is also a good option, as it gives a nice clean flavor compared to black tea. Organic tea options are available at all the cafés. If the tea tastes too bitter, ask for the tea bag separately, wait for the water to cool down to very warm instead of boiling hot, and then dip your tea bag in. The bitterness is usually because the water is too hot.
When eating lunch at Asiana in Newell-Simon, try to get a portion of vegetables on your bowl. Selecting the Wakame salad over a fried spring roll can also be a refreshing, and of course healthy, change. For a drink, if you have never tried Asian soymilk, a can of Yeo’s soymilk at Asiana might make you rethink soy.
Rather than getting soda on your block, get juice instead. A 15.2 oz bottle of Dole’s orange juice provides 190 percent of your daily vitamin C intake. With the weather becoming colder every day, an extra shot of vitamin C is definitely useful. 
At Ginger’s Deli, Subway, or Quiznos, experiment with different healthy options of bread and narrow down your favorites. In addition to providing you with a healthy dose of fiber and other nutrients, non-white breads are more flavorful than their less nutritional, white-bread peers.
That being said, you should not cut yourself off from all your favorite foods. Indulge in pierogies, chocolate, and icecream once in a while, but not regularly or often.
With no real kitchen, eating in a dorm room can be challenging, especially when you are not on a meal plan. But if you survived 15-100, it’s easy to get around food-100.
The easiest and most economical way is getting food from home. Next time you go home, look around in your mother’s pantry. Food from home is usually healthier and, of course, always free.
Try shopping at Giant Eagle for some fresh produce. Their bread is usually fresher, tastier, and healthier than that of other grocery stores. Their bread also comes in a smaller size so you will not end up letting it go stale. Getting food in smaller sizes means that there is a better chance that you’ll finish it before it goes bad. It also allows more flexibility, as you can get a variety of small things to eat.
Fruit is a healthier and a leaner late night snacking option than chips. Bananas are a very “efficient” fruit because there is no need to wash or chop them, and apples are also a good option as they come in different varieties that appeal to different tastes. Notice how both bananas and apples already come in portions, so there’s no need to cut them up like melons and pineapples. 
Including fruit in your meal can be easier than you think. You can add some sliced banana or dried cranberries to your salad. Extra sugar adds a nice sweet aftertaste. Instead of cucumber, adding slices of Granny Smith apples in your sandwich makes it extra crisp and also adds tartness. Don’t limit apples to just peanut butter sandwiches; include slices on your turkey or bacon sandwiches, too. If you have a better-equipped kitchen, then try slicing up honeydew and sample it with prosciutto and cream cheese.
A healthier diet doesn’t mean eating soy protein or drinking wheat grass shots. It’s about having a balanced diet. Start with a small change at a time, try different types of food, and expand your culinary repertoire.

Considering the current state of the economy, few people are happy spending $20 on a DVD. Some students avoid this by illegally downloading movies, while others have no other option but to watch their funds dwindle with each new box-office hit. But this problem might be solved with a new website, LendAround.com, which provides people with free, legal movies.
LendAround operates by using a system of borrowing movies from friends. Upon registering, the users can easily upload a list of DVDs that they are willing to share and keep a wish list of DVDs they want to borrow. They can also invite their friends to join the website, so as to expand the number of DVDs they have access to. When a DVD from the user’s wish list is uploaded on a friend’s movie list, LendAround automatically sends the movie owner a request from the movie borrower. Users can also search through their friends’ lists of DVDs and request to borrow them. The owner can then choose whether to send the DVD to the borrower.
LendAround is much more convenient than borrowing in person. According to Jacqueline Gulyan, their marketing manager, “[LendAround] keeps track of who has your DVDs and whose DVDs you have borrowed ... [and] also sends gentle reminders to people for you.” LendAround’s features make it easy to borrow and lend DVDs without having any difficulty keeping track of which movies belong to whom. The process of borrowing a movie is extremely simple — all it takes is the click of a button. “It takes out the awkwardness you may have for asking to borrow in person,” Gulyan said. It also allows users to remain updated on new additions to friends’ DVD collections, making it easy to locate any desired movie. Sharing movies is a great way to get maximum benefit from them since most people won’t watch movies they own more than a couple of times.
An obvious benefit of LendAround is its price. The website itself is free. The only cost to borrow or lend a movie is 42 cents — the cost of a postage stamp. Users also have the option of delivering and returning movies by hand, instead of by mail, making it entirely free. An estimated “$7 billion a year is spent on movie rentals in the U.S.,” said Gulyan, and LendAround allows individuals to cut back on this cost while still getting the benefit of watching movies. Aside from the economic benefits and convenience of LendAround, the website also has environmental benefits. It facilitates sharing DVDs instead of buying more of them, resulting in fewer resources needed for DVD production, less transportation cost, and less waste. Similar movie borrowing services, such as Netflix, are not as environmentally friendly because the movies are transported to more places before reaching their destination.
LendAround also has a Facebook application for its users, allowing them to encourage friends to use LendAround and conveniently borrow movies while on Facebook. Many users might be concerned about lending out their DVDs using LendAround. The service addresses this problem by keeping track of users who don’t return DVDs. This information can be found on a user’s profile, and anyone can choose not to lend their movies to an irresponsible borrower.
LendAround provides an attractive alternative to other pricey options and is easy-to-use, environmentally friendly, and inexpensive. In a press release, Tim Jackson, the founder of LendAround.com, commented on why he thinks people will use the website to help each other: “A friend does you a favor by lending you something, and you do them a favor in return. What goes around, comes around — that’s our motto,” he said.

The atmosphere at Frightened Rabbit’s Jan. 26 performance wasn’t exactly like that of their sold-out Chicago show two nights before, but the 250 or so bodies who showed up at Carnegie Mellon University’s campus to show their support for the hairy Scots of indie rock were undoubtedly excited about this relatively new phenomenon in the music world.
Hailing from Glasgow, the band started off with just the lead singer Scott Hutchison and his guitar in 2003. Hutchison’s brother, Grant, joined him on the drums a year later, while Billy Kennedy joined six months after that, bringing bass, a keyboard, and a second guitar to the then line-up. It was only after the band recorded their second album that Andy Monaghan joined them in 2008.
Stepping onto the stage that night, Scott announced in his quiet but resonant Scottish accent, “Hi. We’re Frightened Rabbit, and we’re from Scotland.” They opened with the first track from their new album, “The Modern Leper,” which seemed like a particularly good choice, as the audience responded positively by singing along and clapping occasionally.
The entire performance was phenomenal to say the least, and the band’s second album, which is decidedly better than the first, has catapulted them to success all over the country and still hasn’t been able to do them justice. You can see the real, honest pain in every drop of sweat shed from Scott’s forehead with every self-aware, heart-felt lyric. Perhaps the line that best sums up the album, and indeed the concerts from this tour, is “vital parts fall from his system/And dissolve in Scottish soil.” Scott boldly stands on stage and sings this lyric about his falling apart over an ex-love from the bottom of his stomach, with an unmistakable sound of raw Glasgow heartache.
A highlight of the performance was “Good Arms vs. Bad Arms,” which began with an almost haunting air, as the Scottish folk sounds bounced around the large hall. Another was “Square 9,” from their first album, which Scott dedicated to the album itself. The best, however, was “Poke” — for which, as the first song of the encore, Scott came on stage to sing with nothing but an acoustic guitar. Standing at the very front of the stage, basically naked without his microphone or amplifier, he gave an astoundingly passionate and beautiful acoustic performance to the deafeningly silent hall. The entire room was captivated.
After the show, I went backstage to chat with the guys about their new album, the American and Scottish tours, and what their preferred choice of nightwear is.
The Tartan:  How is the tour going so far, and how do you find the American crowd compared to the Scottish crowd? 
 Scott Hutchison: They’re quite similar, actually. Glasgow, because more people have heard of us than in the rest of the UK, Glasgow seems to work, but the rest of Britain doesn’t really work out for us a lot of the time. 
 T: Really? 
 SH: Yeah, I dunno why. But over here it seems to be quite consistently enthusiastic. 
 Grant Hutchison: Not as consistently mental as Glasgow audiences. I mean, there’s nowhere else like that. 
 SH: But New York City is almost like a home crowd sometimes — we’ve played there quite a lot. 
 GH: And Chicago as well. 
 SH: So yeah, it’s been wonderful! The American audience really seems to get it, I guess.
T:[to Scott] All your lyrics, and especially, it would seem, on the second album, are really personal. Did you ever feel quite nervous about letting people hear it? 
 SH: Nah. We didn’t really have an audience at that time, so I really wasn’t aware. When you write the song, you’re in your bedroom alone, and then when you record it, it’s just you, the band, and whoever’s recording it. You’re not aware of it being released and lots of people hearing it, so that makes it easier to make it more personal. I don’t regret it either. I think honesty is something other people respond to, and I think it’s one of the things people like about us.
T: Pajamas, boxers, or nude? 
 SH: I love pajamas. But not in the summer. 
 GH: I’ve never worn any pajamas. I’d like to though! I usually go for boxers. 
 SH: You feel like a 12-year-old in pajamas. It’s great!

Believe it or not, there are still two months until spring finally comes tumbling around. As winter treads on, it is difficult to feel motivated about getting dressed, and more so about dressing well. After all, with trying not to fall on a sheet of ice on a sidewalk and bundling up in thick sweaters to survive the Pittsburgh winter, it becomes hard to concentrate on keeping your wardrobe trendy.
But why make it dreary? Just because it’s cold, there’s no reason to succumb to looking sluggish in sweatpants and give up looking unique, sophisticated, and refined. A glimpse of the attendees at winter’s Paris Fashion Week will reveal stunningly dressed men and women from all walks of the fashion industry. Vogue editors, assistant buyers, models’ agents, and even the photographers who crowd around to take these stylish pictures are dressed to perfection often craftily layering the season’s most desirable pieces, and looking like they’ve just stepped off runways themselves. Looking at these photos, it would be hard to tell that it’s winter in Paris as well. These people are arguably the most influential when it comes to commercializing trends, as they smooth avant-garde, hyperbolic runway looks into wearable pieces of art.
With that in mind, it should be comforting to know that even if it is a record-setting freezing day in Pittsburgh, there are still ways to look collected and stay cozy. Karen Branick, a junior architecture student, looks flawless in a bright poppy orange wool coat, one that shows off her silhouette well, and adds on a perfect flash of color. Her black leather boots, which have a tinge of toughness, are winter-ready and contrast well with her feminine coat. Another bright piece, her white headband, completes her outfit with just the right amount of glamour.
A trend that is being heavily pushed through the fashion world is having a neutral palette and mixing and matching other neutral tones to keep the look light but interesting. Khaki is no longer a “don’t,” and instead has been revamped into elegant tops and silky loose pants. Jee Hye Lee, a visitor to Carnegie Mellon from Connecticut, showed off a terrifically asymmetrical jacket in a structure heavily resembling a menswear blazer. Lee layered on different textures in white, with a fringe scarf, cardigan, and tunic. Her beige pants were neatly tucked into brown leather boots, giving the look the edginess of spring without compromising her warmth.
Whether you’re a fan of bright colors, prefer to keep a clean, neutral look, or like dressing head to toe in black, it’s the effort that counts. Snow and winter should not automatically be equated with sweatshirts and Uggs; rather, it’s a much more fun time to experiment, perfect layering skills, and mix up unconventional pieces.

New in Town, directed by Jonas Elmer, is the story of a snobby businesswoman from Miami who is sent to Minnesota to take charge of a project at a local factory that is close to being shut down. This film could easily be misconstrued as the classic “chick-flick,” but it actually isn’t. It lacks flair, romance, and originality, but the dynamic cast does an admirable job of working with what little they are given.
The film begins with Lucy Hill (Renée Zellweger) going for a jog. This same scene shows up in the ending of the film as well, which is confusing. It is not clear if this entire film is a memory or if they just wanted her to jog again at the end but didn’t feel like shooting another version. Despite this directorial flaw, Zellweger — an Academy Award winner — does a remarkable job of capturing the essence of her overly-privileged character. With this role, Zellweger is able to give her classic attitude and spunk, and it remains present throughout the entirety of this film. It is especially apparent when Lucy arrives in Minnesota and experiences snow and cold weather for the first time. In Minnesota, Lucy meets Blanche Gunderson (Siobhan Fallon), who is her assistant at the factory. Throughout the film, Blanche becomes more of an over-bearing friend than a loyal assistant. Fallon plays one of the funniest and most enjoyable characters in the film because she always has a random comment about something going on in her life. The creation of this character by the screenwriter was obviously meant to be the comic relief for the audience, and it was successful.
While at Blanche’s house for dinner, Lucy meets Ted Mitchell (Harry Connick Jr.), a single father who is a widower. In the beginning, Lucy doesn’t seem too impressed by Ted because he drives an old pick-up truck and doesn’t live in a big city. 
Despite their confrontation at the dinner table, they do make a lasting impression on each other. This is the moment in the film where the ending becomes disturbingly predictable. New in Town feels like more of a reversed Pretty Woman instead of a new film of 2009.
After some point during the arguing and drunken exchanges, Lucy and Ted develop feelings for each other, but unfortunately, the audience doesn’t really see it occur. It just happens. The director only provides a scene with them kissing on the couch to symbolize their romance. For some reason, the screenwriter and director did not think that certain points of the plot needed to be included in the film.
New in Town could have easily been a great romantic comedy, but the lack of development in the script holds it back.

A student writes about arsenic mines, and about which countries produce most of the substance. This article has absolutely nothing to do with Carnegie Tech, and was written in between the Glee Club bulletin and a menu for a Carnegie Tech boarding house dinner. The moral of this story: senior citizens were once just as scatterbrained as we are now.

Carnegie Institute of Technology President J.C. Warner speaks out against the belief that higher education is a “right of every citizen rather than considering it a privilege.” Universities have received pressure to tailor their curricula to those of the upper echelon. The home economics department, upon hearing this news, shielded themselves with aluminum foil and cake frosting to protect against any academic attacks.

Few things come as a surprise to the writer of “Did You Know.” This is one of them. Carnegie Mellon announces the opening of a campus pub. Yes, that’s right. Your eyes do not deceive you. The same Carnegie Mellon as today actually opened up a campus pub. No, they didn’t require a 3.5 QPA for admission. It’s a full-fledged, honest-to-goodness pub. Now excuse me while I search for some leprechauns and unicorns.

The sports section gloomily writes about the Broncos cruising to another Super Bowl. Depressed about the absence of another team who didn’t make it, the writer drones on about Denver’s win. You could almost read the yawns in between the words. Hopefully, whoever wrote about the absolute domination of the Pittsburgh Steelers in this week’s Tartan didn’t have such a burden.

The Tartan’s headline screams “Food bites back, students hospitalized.” The article goes on to explain that 34 students and one staff member had reported complaints of diarrhea, fever, and weakness. With these symptoms of food poisoning, all fingers are pointing toward the quality of food that is being served on campus.

Students protest Carnegie Mellon’s $1.4 million contract with the U.S. Army. Over 50 protesters were reported to be in front of the Software Engineering Institute, which plans to develop a new line of offensive ground weapons called “Crusher.” The army was hesitant to explain what the weapons exactly did, but the name suggests that they probably take items and crush them.

Dear Joe,
I need your help — I started writing a newspaper this semester to make this place a bit more habitable. I chose to do this through satire, mostly because the writers of our current satire paper are borderline illiterate.
My views aren’t for everyone, but I know that I’m right about everything I feel and think. Last week, I published an anti-segregation article, and now most of the people on campus want to break my legs. Call me a new-fashioned, crazy liberal, but I feel in my soul that segregating black people is just not cool. How do I make my point to my audience without getting killed/scalped/knifed in the meantime?
—The Editor
Dear Editor,
I’ve taken it upon myself to grab a copy of your paper, The Weekly Slant, and read your piece on segregation. Obtaining a copy was the easy part. Your paper is scattered everywhere. I even found a copy in my shower. Regardless of the quality of your publication, you have the distribution skills of an expert. As for the subject matter that fills your paper, that is an interesting issue.
First, I’ll let you know that I completely disagree with the message you sent out about SPIRIT. In my opinion, celebrating diversity and mandating segregation are two separate (and not equal) issues. Yet the article was well-written, the point well-thought, and the issue well-expressed. To answer your question, it seems like people disagree with you strongly. Your paper does have one advantage over The Tartan, however. When people find my advice abysmally awful, they usually have to throw the entire Pillbox away. Your readers, if so strongly offended, only have one sheet to take care of. 
Slanted (but not biased), 
Joe
Dear Joe,
I spent a semester studying in the wonderful country of Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon). I have many fascinating stories to tell, but it seems like people just don’t want to listen to them. What will it take to make people understand what a life-changing experience I’ve had?
—Studious in Skibo
Dear Studious,
You’ve studied abroad, but your friends are a-bored with your ramblings about how different culture is thousands of miles away. There may be several reasons why the reception of your stories isn’t going so hot. Let’s make a list to organize your potential failures: 1) Are your stories about Sri Lanka, or irrelevant things you did in Sri Lanka? Regardless of location, shopping for detergent is a boring task. 2) Are you repeating your stories? After hearing about how you didn’t understand opera in Sri Lanka, another story about not understanding a Sri Lankan dentist probably won’t set the mood for interest. 3) If the food was good, your stories aren’t interesting. If the food was bad, you have some potential. But the food has to be outrageously bad. Not just Olive Garden bad. 4) Finally, you should realize that interesting culture can be found relatively close. Participating in a Steelers game with locals will teach you much more about jungle instincts than the Congo. Just because you left the country doesn’t mean you hold a monopoly on describing culture.
With that said, I hope you’re getting used to life in the States again. To speed the reorientation process, I suggest a trip to McDonald’s, followed by throwing your garbage on the sidewalk when finished.
Studying Broadly, 
Joe

Dear David Berman,
It’s been over a week now since you said farewell to us all on the Drag City message board, and I can’t say that it’s been easy. You know, I feel sad about this, but it’s also hard to tell these days. Maybe it’s a door. But there are no doors underground, not in that cave where you’re going to sing your farewell songs tomorrow. I thought about meeting you there. But I don’t have much of a taste for spectacular tragedy these days.
I’ve been keeping up with the messages posted in response to your farewell. It’s kind of like looking at the Facebook profile of the kid in your hometown in the days after he was mauled by the lion escaped from the county zoo. You know what I’m saying. Everyone and everything comes out of the woodwork, blowing their noses and wiping their tears on the comfortless Kleenex of the Internet. They post public messages in the second person; they praise your deceased wonder. They reminisce over chance encounters and paint them as intimate portraits of a relationship strung through years of a one-sided infatuation.
And I wish I could say I am above those people, but publishing this letter to you proves that I am not. I have let the spit of your song fall onto my forehead so many times I thought I could claim baptism. When I last saw you in Pittsburgh, I confused our sufferings and walked away reminded of that inexorable sadness — maybe the same feeling you’ve come to call the burn for justice. Earlier this year you spoke of a crisis up ahead and you called for us to all assemble, you stepped up to be our hero. We got behind you in droves and waited for instructions to deploy.
But maybe you can only be everything if you reduce yourself to nothing. In the wake of newly formed absences, we will always try to hold onto whatever is left. So here I am on the highway, honking out of loneliness, and here I am on a chair floating in a sea of beer. Here I am, unable to believe what is at bay. Here I am, wearing my silly private’s uniform when my captain has long gone home.
Here I am, David, selfishly waiting for you to come back.
Yours in the Wild Kindness, 
MC

On Thursday, Jan. 22, a campus tradition most commonly used to advertise springtime fraternity recruitment or Friday night Tartans’ basketball games turned political.
In thick red letters atop a coat of white house paint, the message “P-E-A-C-E: 1370 Dead, 40% Women + Children, Gaza, Billions to Rebuild, Give Aid!, UNICEF,” was spelled out across the six paint-laden posts of the Fence in the middle of the Cut. Six students from the Muslim Student Association (MSA) painted the fence overnight to demonstrate their support for the people of Gaza.
MSA is an on-campus organization whose mission is to foster awareness on campus about Islam, eliminate cultural misconceptions, and unite Muslim and non-Muslim individuals, according to the group’s website, www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/msa.
“A number of our members and board members had mentioned that they would like to do something to help raise awareness and aid for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza,” said Nader Shakir, a member of MSA’s executive board and a fifth-year senior in SHS.
“So much damage was done to civilian populations [especially women and children] as well as non-military infrastructures [including schools, hospitals, water, electricity], that many of our members felt moved to do something,” added Sarah Aboutalib, a doctoral student in computer science and president of MSA. “Especially since where much of the rest of the world seem concerned with the humanitarian crisis, we [people in the U.S.] seem to be taking it lightly or are unaware of it all together.”
According to the MSA, its goal of raising awareness of the need for peace in Gaza and aid for UNICEF for the civilian victims of the war was mostly met with success.
“We did receive some donations for UNICEF during the tabling, and the simple fact that so many individuals have approached our members with regards to the Fence-painting shows that at least some have taken notice of the issue,” Shakir said.
Carnegie Mellon has students with origins in the cultures of the Middle Eastern region who, while physically dissociated from the fighting in Gaza, feel ties to those in closer proximity.
“Regardless of one’s opinion in terms of the political issues, we should all be trying to help give aid to those who are innocent casualties of the conflict,” Aboutalib added. “We at Carnegie Mellon pride ourselves in being aware and involved in current events. As a result, we have a responsibility to help the situation as much as we can.”
The pro-Gaza message on the part of the MSA, however short-lived, shed light on the issue of Palestinian and Jewish student relations on campus. “I think [the conflict in Gaza] is heart-wrenching for everybody to see,” said Aaron Weil, executive director of Hillel, the Jewish University Center of Pittsburgh located near the intersection of Forbes Avenue and Craig Street.
“Jewish students are also interested in getting the word out,” Weil added. 
“Palestinian sympathetics — which includes many Jewish students — are rightfully outraged at the suffering” in Gaza.
Students from the MSA said that they did not necessarily expect a strong, campus-wide reaction to their message but rather saw the Fence as an opportunity to promote peace and raise awareness of the conflict that is affecting Palestinians in Gaza and worldwide.
“While I was tabling in the UC to collect donations for UNICEF, one student had mentioned that her friend was a little upset because she didn’t think the Fence should be used for political messages,” Aboutalib explained, adding that the MSA did not intend for the message to be political, and recognizing that openly acknowledging the situation in Gaza can be sensitive for students on either side of the conflict. “This has made it somewhat hard to come up with events that can bring awareness to the problems while being careful not to offend either side,” she added.
The Fence was quickly repainted by Friday morning. Students from the MSA explained, though, that this repainting was not purposeful or particularly directed toward them or the conflict in Gaza; the inclement weather and freezing temperatures made it difficult to guard the Fence once the MSA had already successfully conveyed their message to the snow-covered campus community.
“It was kind of sad to see all our hard work erased so quickly, especially since we felt it was such an important message,” Aboutalib said.
While the fighting between Israel and Gaza has slowed, the cultural significance of the conflict continues to be relevant to different religious, cultural, and political groups on campus, such as the MSA.
In terms of how the conflict in Gaza will continue to affect students on campus, Aboutalib said, “I think we first need to educate ourselves about the conflict from both sides and its effect on all levels, going down to the individual people being affected.”

Though it’s currently covered in a layer of slush, the walk across Forbes Avenue just might be getting a little more fun in the coming months. 
Student Body President and Vice President Jared Itkowitz and Pooja Godbole, along with Executive Cabinet members junior business administration major Megan Larcom and sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Aneesh Devi, have proposed a plan to cover the main crosswalk at the intersection of Forbes Avenue and Morewood Avenue with colorful Tartan plaid.
The crosswalk redesign is part of a larger design package introduced by Itkowitz and his staff that will include the addition of perimeter flags on Forbes Ave. bearing Carnegie Mellon’s name. The plan may evolve to include other design improvements.
Larcom, who thought up the idea for the plaid crosswalks, realizes that the proposal will be a tough sell and may take months to come to fruition.
“It’s quite a process. I think it’s great and I think there is support for it, but we need to assess the costs before going forward,” Larcom said, adding that similar plans have already been enacted at other universities, including the University of Wisconsin and the University of Alabama.
Larcom and Itkowitz indicated that the plan will have to withstand review by numerous committees, offices, and agencies, including Carnegie Mellon’s Design Review Committee, Pittsburgh’s Department of City Planning, and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT).
The Student Body executives have been working with Jen Layman, Carnegie Mellon’s Assistant Director of Government Relations, to navigate the winding path through city and state government.
“I met with the students at the end of last semester and talked to them about their ideas. We have a meeting set for early February to speak with Dan Gilman, Councilman Bill Peduto’s chief of staff, about their ideas. We will follow his recommendations for next steps,” said Layman. 
Though the plaid may only take 24 hours to put down, Layman estimates that it may be a few months before the student leaders will even know if the plan is viable.
This is not the first time Larcom has tackled the issue of campus signage. As an underclassman, Larcom met with success in getting bathroom signs installed in Doherty and Wean Halls. This time, she has set her sights at the university level.
“You should know when you are [at] Forbes and Morewood that you are at the entrance of Carnegie Mellon. Right now, you don’t,” Larcom said.
In addition to creating a sense of campus identity, Itkowitz and Godbole also hope the crosswalks will promote safety by clearly delineating the extent of the sidewalks.
The plaid could be laid down in a number of ways, including the use of traffic paint and asphalt printing. A third option is the use of thermoplastic tape, a skid-resistant, reflective, and durable tape that is superheated onto the street. 
Itkowitz and Godbole see the tape as an example of technological innovation that is consistent with the university’s core goals.
“Carnegie Mellon strives to be an innovative community, and having this [crosswalk] will be really unique,” Itkowitz said.
Itkowitz, who does not have funding for the project, is planning to fundraise within the university’s administrative and academic departments, and, if necessary, at the Student Senate and Graduate Student Assembly.

A recent study conducted by the Tepper School of Business was designed to analyze the life-cycle changes that employees undergo as they make their way up the corporate ladder. 
Although the study was designed to look at executives from all different types of backgrounds and experience levels, some of the most surprising results came when comparing salaries and compensations of female executives to their male counterparts. 
In a world where people sometimes assume that males have a significant salary advantage over females, women were actually observed to earn more than men in some situations.
The data set used comprised 16,300 managers who were included in the Standard and Poor’s ExecuComp database between 1992 and 2006. 
Only about 5 percent of this sample was female, although it was found that women tended to congregate in the lower executive ranks more than men. 
Although the study found that the educational background on average was practically identical for both genders, it did note that “females are on average three years younger than males, have three and a half years less executive experience, and two years less tenure on their current job.”
According to Robert Miller, a professor of economics and strategy at Tepper and a co-author of the study, this observation was just one of many which supported the finding that “women are leaving their positions more than males,” often because of outside obligations, a negative climate within the workplace, or specific desires like starting a family.
This gap in experience was found to hurt female executives considerably in terms of salaries and compensation. 
On average, the study found that the average female compensation is about $440,000 less than that of males, a significant decrease from the admittedly considerable average compensation of $2,460,000 for the surveyed executives. 
These results suggest that because of less executive experience, women are not monetarily rewarded as much as men. 
The difference in pay, however, may vary depending on the field under consideration, as shown by the 2007 Society of Women Engineers (SWE) literature review. 
The review commented that, “interestingly, in such high-demand fields as engineering and computer science, these [pay] gaps are often much smaller than in fields in which there is a larger supply of workers, even in other STEM [science, technology, engineering, and math] fields.” 
The publication also states that, in some ethnic groups, including Latinas, 
African-Americans, and American Indian or Alaskan natives, women engineers actually earn slightly more than men. 
It continues by stating that “non-Hispanic white women on average earned a little less than their male counterparts while Asian/Pacific Islander women and men had the same average salaries.”
The survey performed by Miller and his colleagues found similar results when comparing a male and a female executive of the same age, educational background, and job experience. 
They even noted that, on average, the female executive was observed to earn $100,000 more than her male counterpart. 
This result, Miller stated, could not be explained by any specific factor within the study, but was perhaps an indicator of some “unmeasured ability” that gave women executives a slight edge or showed that companies were trying to enhance gender diversity within their higher- ranked positions by providing this extra incentive for women.
Regardless of the reasons behind this result, the study did show that, at least among executive positions, females tended to fare just as well as, if not better than, males in terms of compensation and promotion. The major limiting factor proved not to be the educational background of the individual, but the tendency of females to leave their positions sooner than males.
Despite this, continued efforts to improve situations for women and minorities in the workforce have opened doors for many individuals. 
As Krystina Teoh, a sophomore mechanical engineering major, put it, “If I had lived even a generation ago, I would not have had access to the same opportunities which are available to me now.”

Sustainability mixers, climate change discussions, and political debates on energy and the economy will take over the University Center on Wednesday as Sustainable Earth hosts Focus the Nation, its second campus-wide teach-in on global warming.
“Focus the Nation is mostly about education,” said Sarah Strano, a junior civil engineering major and Sustainable Earth vice president. “We’re trying to educate as many people as possible about all aspects of climate change.”
Focus the Nation is not unique to Carnegie Mellon, but is rather part of a national movement.
Created in 2006 by a professor at Lewis and Clark College, the project is currently funded by the Green House Network, a nonprofit organization aimed at educating young people. 
Focus the Nation hosts lectures at universities nationwide, campaigns for global warming legislation, and aims to promote general climate change awareness.
“Focus the Nation is like a focal point to get [Sustainable Earth] started,” said Daisy Wang, a sophomore civil engineering major and Sustainable Earth member.
Wang commented on the growth she has seen in the number of people joining Sustainable Earth and other environmental groups on campus, and hopes that Focus the Nation will only encourage more to increase their awareness.
Strano mentioned that she was especially excited for the keynote address that will kick off this year’s three-day Focus the Nation event.
“We were really lucky to bring Peter Tertzakian here this year,” Strano said.
Tertzakian is an energy expert, the chief energy economist and director of ARC Financial Corporation, and the award-winning author of A Thousand Barrels a Second.
The days’ events will include a presentation from the Green Practices Committee, a lecture on alternative transportation, and a discussion on the ethics and business of environmental policy.
Unique to this year, many of the events will encompass the “First 100 Days” theme.
On Thursday at 7 p.m., Cliff Davidson, a professor in the department of civil and environmental engineering, will host a webcast and discussion on Obama’s proposed environmental policy.
On Friday at 3:30 p.m., presenters from the Pittsburgh Project, a nonprofit community development organization, and Carnegie Mellon Students for Barack Obama will lead a session on how to get involved in the community and to promote civic engagement for a sustainable future.
Vanessa Schweizer, a doctoral student in engineering and public policy and a key Focus the Nation organizer in Sustainable Earth, commented on the special timing of this year’s teach-in.
“We have a new President and a new Congress,” Schweizer said. “We’ve also known about [global warming] for more than 20 years now and we haven’t done anything. Now is the time.”
Schweizer expressed her excitement at seeing the campus turn out at this week’s events.
“We have a lot of faculty and senior students working on things to address climate change and the energy crisis. It just makes sense [to have this event],” she said.
Schweitzer mentioned she is most looking forward to the Heinz Talks, Part II. On Friday at noon, Lee Branstetter, a professor in the Heinz School of Public Policy and Management, and Costa Samaras, a professor in the department of engineering and public policy, will debate if market-based incentives are sufficient to solve the climate change problem. 
This talk is a follow-up on October’s Heinz Talks, Part I, in which Branstetter and Granger Morgan, a professor in the department of engineering and public policy, heatedly exchanged their views on the U.S. cap-and-trade economic policy.
As of Friday evening, Focus the Nation will officially end.
Austin Redwood, an junior Humanities and Arts Scholar and president of Sustainable Earth, expressed his hope that students take some of the message away with them.
“People should use their discipline, or what they’re studying, and attach it to climate change,” Redwood said. “Especially with Obama working so fast, there is so much to think about.”

Similar to the new President of the United States, the president of Carnegie Mellon is being commended for his transparent leadership in regard to his detailed e-mail to the community about the impact the economy has had on Carnegie Mellon, the current state of the endowment, and his plans to engineer a more prosperous future.
With over a million American jobs lost in 2008, Cohon explained in his e-mail last week that the university aims to be as “creative and flexible as possible in providing alternatives” to job cuts so that Carnegie Mellon will be able to hold on to its valued staff members. 
Although there will be salary freezes in the upcoming year, Cohon’s plan includes “a resumption of raises,” fiscal years 2011 and 2012. Cohon’s honesty about Carnegie Mellon’s current position and plan, and his optimism for the future, is refreshing to many.
Megan Larcom, an junior business major and chief of staff for the undergraduate student body, said, “Cohon’s candid e-mail shows how responsible he is in his decision-making process.”
Although current students and faculty may have been captivated by the president’s e-mail, what remains to be seen is how the economy affects prospective students. 
American high school seniors have been applying to colleges in record numbers, and Cohon remarked that early decision applicants to Carnegie Mellon increased by 30 percent in the 2008–2009 year.
“I think the applicant pool might be affected next year,” Larcom predicted. 
“Some people might be discouraged from applying to such an expensive school.”
Linda Anderson, Carnegie Mellon’s director of student aid, explained that the number of requests for reduced income appeals, which is a general indicator of extreme economic descent, has not gone up from the prospective class of 2012 applicants to the prospective class of 2013 applicants.
Anderson said, “Despite the media portrayal that most lenders have stopped lending private loans, part of our job is to educate parents and students about how to borrow successfully. We recommend banks for families to borrow from, and no data has indicated that there is an extreme economic impact affecting prospective students in terms of shifts in borrowing patterns.”
Currently, 48 percent of Carnegie Mellon students who apply for financial aid receive it. 
However, Anderson projects that in the 2009–2010 year, about 5 percent more students, increasing the number to 53 percent, will qualify for financial assistance, and they will be accommodated.
“The university has made a dollar commitment to expand our budget for allocating financial aid and funding any increase in students who apply in the upcoming year,” said Anderson.
She explained that there is a standardized way to approach appeals, and if parents lose their jobs or get laid off due to the economic downturn, the students will not be penalized because of Cohon’s commitment.
By keeping the community aware and active in the process of how Carnegie Mellon plans to manage money in the future, Cohon strives to maintain “our institutional momentum while keeping focused on our mission to recruit and retain the best and brightest faculty and students and to maintain the highest quality education and research for which this university is known throughout the world.”
When asked about the future of Carnegie Mellon’s endowment and the potential reduction to financial aid, junior economics major Betty Castillo said, “I trust President Cohon. He’s got everything under control.”

[BOLD]Former envoy to Africa joins faculty[BOLD]
Carnegie Mellon has recently welcomed Jendayi Frazer, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs under the George W. Bush administration, onto the university staff.
Frazer has become a distinguished public service professor in both the department of social and decision sciences and in the H. John Heinz III College’s School of Public Policy and Management.
In her time with the State Department, Frazer was instrumental in several diplomatic arrangements. She has assisted with reconciliation efforts in Somalia, with the 2007 post-election Kenyan debates, in discussion with Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe, and in the establishment of democratic governments in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
Before she was appointed as the assistant secretary of state for African affairs, Frazer served as U.S. ambassador to South Africa and special assistant to the president and senior director of African affairs at the National Security Council.
Prior to joining the Bush administration, Frazer was a public policy professor at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. 
She also has experience teaching at the University of Denver and serving as a guest fellow at Stanford University, where she obtained her bachelor’s in political science and African studies, her masters, and, ultimately, a Ph.D in political science.  
[BOLD]University gains research partner[BOLD] 
In January, Lockheed Martin announced a research partnership with Carnegie Mellon in the development of its OMEGA services, an enterprise planning network. 
Throughout the calendar year, Lockheed Martin will be funding $640,000 of research at Carnegie Mellon’s Entertainment Technology Center. Lockheed Martin picked the university for its ability to combine innovative technologies with systems engineering concepts, and hopes to see the fusion of the two in their software.
OMEGA is not only an enterprise planning service, but also assists in management, optimization, and integration capabilities. Lockheed Martin plans to update this software with the help of Carnegie Mellon’s patented Synthetic Interview tool. 
The interview device transforms database information into a video persona with which the person accessing it can have a conversation. Carnegie Mellon will add to the system and interview tool with modeling and simulation analysis that it has already put to the test in video gaming advances.
Carnegie Mellon’s Entertainment Technology Center was the brainchild of late Carnegie Mellon computer science professor and inspirational speaker Randy Pausch.

Over 2.5 million people lost their jobs last year, with over half a million jobs lost in December alone. It was the second-worst job loss rating since 1945, and the trend continues this year. Last Monday marked 65,400 jobs lost, especially in the service and manufacturing sectors.  While some analysts believe the recession will end after the second quarter of this year, the economy has yet to bounce back. Here are some statistics about the declining job market:
Number of jobs to be cut by Sprint Nextel Corp. by Mar. 31: 8000
Percentage of Home Depot total workforce that has been lost: 2
Number of positions lost last Wednesday: 27,000
Professional and business service jobs lost: 113,000
Number of lost financial service jobs: 14,000

More publications should be like Wired, and more products — although not necessarily more cars — should be like the Ultimate Aero EV.
With Shelby Supercars’ new super-fast electric car set to enter the speed-demon consumer scene in February, the divergence of the automobile design industry between speed and sustainability may finally be reversed. From my non-professional viewpoint, it seems that, as technology improves at a similar rate as the need for environmentally responsible products increases, fast cars and earth-friendly cars are ever more disjointed.
I’m nowhere near an expert on cars. If I ever claim to be, I hope someone will bring me right back down to the reality in which I avoid dealing with my own car at all costs, save for filling it with gas I can’t afford and replacing the overly worn windshield wipers every few years. In fact, I’ll be the first to admit that I stared blankly at a friend of mine who asked if my Volvo had front-wheel drive after I went sliding all over Fifth Avenue on a small patch of ice an eighth of an inch thick. Yes, it does indeed have front-wheel drive, and no, my car does not enjoy the steep hill down Negley Avenue in inclement weather. Later in the same week in January, I even asked the sympathetic employee behind the counter at PepBoys if I should buy summer tires after a tiny piece of glass destroyed the sidewall of one of my all-weather tires. No, no I should not.
But I know sustainable design, and I know when an industry is taking a turn for the better — and the better, to me, means the betterment of the environment. As designer Bruce Mau reiterated at his lecture in Rangos on Jan. 20, environmental sustainability nerds have been preaching to the American public to abandon its cars and instead walk and bike everywhere since the ’60s — and to make love, not war, of which we’ve only been partially successful. The reality is that cars are, at least for the time being, a significant part of our consumerist, time-sensitive culture. Right now, they’re not going anywhere.
The call is thus for a change to this industry, a change that is feasible enough for typical car owners to make the switch, innovative enough to significantly reduce the impact of car culture on the environment, and interesting enough to be worth pursuing to automotive designers. Shelby Supercars, with its Ultimate Aero EV, has taken the first step toward this change, in uniting an increasingly fragmented automobile industry. The car, which is an electric version of the company’s record-breaking Ultimate Aero vehicle, is said to get up to 1000 horsepower and travel from zero to 60 miles per hour in two and a half seconds — and have a tiny 10-minute recharge time.
The more that environmentally friendly cars — if only marginally so — can alter the landscape of automobile consumption, though, the better. Shelby Supercars’ creation of a ridiculously fast speed machine (I can’t shake the lyrics of Rihanna’s “Shut Up and Drive” song from my mind) that is electric and able to perform so well without all that wasted fuel creates a new echelon of automobile design that designers will hopefully strive to beat. Making electric cars cool, for lack of a word as equally progressive as this speed machine itself, could be the ticket toward a truly environmentally savvy everyday car for the American people.
We’re not going to see Ultimate Aero EVs beating us to the best parking spots at the Waterfront or through the yellow light at the intersection of Morewood and Forbes Avenues anytime soon. But that’s not the point. This innovative product could alter the automobile industry for the better, from the upper echelon down to the low-end cars favored by young 20-somethings like the majority of those reading this article. Other products from other industries should, if possible, follow suit.
For this to happen, though, it is up to the editors at publications like Wired to use their magazine and online blog’s position as a well-respected, multidisciplinary source of information to get the word out (how Carnegie Mellon of them). When articles like the publication’s “World’s Fastest Car Goes Electric” from Jan. 23 are able to be easily read alongside a blog entry on technology in the rebuilding of Afghanistan’s economy, readers with a multitude of interests — and connections to industries and other information powerhouses — will be able to get on board with the revolution(s) (per minute).

“I’m a Barbie girl/In a Barbie world/Life in plastic/It’s fantastic.”
So begin the lyrics to the infamous “Barbie Girl” song, made famous by Aqua and sung loudly by middle school girls everywhere. And this coming February, the world is about to get even more Barbie, in the form of a Barbie fashion show in New York Fashion Week to celebrate the doll’s 50th birthday.
In some ways, nothing makes more sense than Barbie having her own fashion show. After all, who is better suited to showcase fashion than a doll designed to do just that? I’ll admit to being one of the girls who had more Barbie dolls and accessories than I knew what to do with, and the fun of playing with the dolls wasn’t giving them names and stories and histories — it was deciding what they should wear. I owned more clothes for my Barbies than I could ever dream of owning myself, and would spend hours putting together outfits for our dolls with my sister and arguing over who got what skirt or shirt. And words cannot even describe how badly I wanted to own some of Barbie’s clothes for myself; the clothes that she had defined cool, and I badly wanted to be as stylish as her.
The Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), one of the sponsors of New York Fashion Week, and many big-name designers apparently agree. As Diane von Furstenberg, designer and CFDA president, said in a statement, “Barbie represents a confident and independent woman with an amazing ability to have fun while remaining glamorous.” The clothes for the fashion show will be Barbie-inspired and created by 50 different designers. Christian Louboutin will also be creating a pair of heels in Barbie pink to be worn with every outfit. This fashion show, basically, is any little girl’s dream — gorgeous clothes from famous designers, hot pink heels, and Barbie — what more could a girl ask for?
In terms of fashion and clothes, I think it’s more than appropriate that Barbie gets her own fashion show. What I think the CFDA is forgetting, however, or choosing to overlook, is that the name Barbie conjures more than just images of style and sophistication. Barbie also brings to mind an unattainable figure that most guys lust after and most girls would die for. Barbie is more than just great clothes and shoes — she’s the image of perfection, perfect body included. And the fashion industry is already more than criticized (and rightly so) for promoting less-than-healthy bodies as the ideal. With the number of high-fashion models admitting that they have an eating disorder growing rapidly, perhaps promoting Barbie, a picture of plastic perfection with her figure, is not the best idea.
It seems a bit of an oxymoron to have, on one hand, models strutting down the runway in Barbie-inspired couture, and on the other hand, a CFDA sponsored health booth in Bryant Park, where representatives from the Renfrew Center, an eating disorder treatment facility, will be present to answer any questions. This year will also be the second anniversary of the CFDA’s health initiatives, a set of guidelines and recommendations designed to promote a healthier Fashion Week and fashion industry in general (although the CFDA is clear to point out that these initiatives are not about policing the suggestions at all, but rather just awareness and education about unhealthy behavior). So while the CFDA is working to create a healthier image for the fashion industry, they are also giving a whole runway show to a plastic, perfect doll.
And Mattel isn’t planning on stopping Barbie’s new fashion career after her fashion show, either. In addition to partnering with the CFDA for future New York Fashion Weeks, the company has plans to debut a line of skincare products called “Plastic Smooth.” If wanting Barbie’s figure and clothes wasn’t enough, now you can also try to get her oh-so-aptly named smooth (plastic) skin, furthering her image of perfection to girls everywhere.
It’s one thing to play with Barbie as a little girl, but it’s a completely different thing to want to be Barbie, especially when the products with her name on it are geared toward a much older audience. At a time when many women are already comparing themselves to models seen in magazines and going to extreme lengths — plastic surgery, eating disorders — to try to obtain this level of perfection, Mattel is only going to make women more self-critical as they push Barbie’s image on women with already low self-esteem.
I don’t fault Mattel and the CFDA for bringing Barbie to the runway; the doll has had so many other careers (and, of course, outfits to go with each and every one of them) that Barbie was bound to vogue down the runway sooner or later. What I do hope, though, is that the models who wear the Barbie-inspired outfits stay true to the description of Barbie that von Furstenberg used — “a confident and independent woman.” Hopefully, this won’t mean stick-thin girls making their way down the runway in their Barbie pink heels, but rather models who are confident and independent and have the right body image to portray Barbie as the confident, fashion-forward woman the fashion industry sees her as.

What do you get when you cross two major motion-picture studios and a cult comic book fan following who have waited over 20 years for the premiere of Watchmen, the movie? Why, a lawsuit, of course, but more on that later.
Watchmen is a film adaptation of a 12-issue comic book limited series published by DC Comics. It takes place in an alternate history where the U.S. and Soviet Union are on the brink of nuclear war. Superheroes have been outlawed and most are in retirement, but when a government-sponsored superhero is murdered, an investigation into his death turns into a shocking conclusion about the course of history as “we” know it.
However, unlike my usual work, (cough “Dollar Movie” cough), I’m not here to review this film. I’m here to share with you the course that this movie took that eventually ended in an out-of-court settlement between 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros., two giants of the motion-picture industry. And why 20th Century Fox committed a major no-no
.
It all began in 1986 when producer Lawrence Gordon purchased the movie rights to Watchmen for 20th Century Fox. Now, without boring you with long accounts of how many men and women failed to make this movie for 20 years, here’s a summary of the studios that bailed on the project: 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros., Universal Studios, Paramount Pictures, and the now defunct Revolution Studios. Screenwriter David Hayter wrote a script in 2001 that ended up finding its way to Warner Bros., who turned the movie into what it is today, after only 20 years of being mired in development hell.
So, that’s it, right? March 6, 2009 is set as the release date for one of the most anticipated comic book movies in history and everyone lives happily ever after.
Then, Fox comes along at the last minute and almost ruins the day. Even though they had no creative decision-making during the development of Hayter’s and Snyder’s version of the movie, Fox sued Warner Bros., claiming that they still owned the distribution rights due to a small buy-out that went unpaid by producer Lawrence Gordon in 1991.
Now, I will admit that, from a business standpoint, Fox played their cards right. They found a loophole and used it to make money. Fox and Warner Bros. reached an out-of-court lump sum settlement along with 8½ percent of the Box Office receipts, and if the movie makes what Snyder’s 300 made, that’d be $38.8 million, which is a nice bit of cash for sitting on your butt for 20 years.
However, from a creative and artistic standpoint, Fox is making a run for the jerk of the year award. They actually issued an injunction to delay the release of Watchmen in order to resolve their suit. It’s ludicrous that a studio with absolutely no role in the making of a film would be able stop it from being released. Warner Bros. succeeded in making Watchmen where Fox failed and they got jealous, simple as that. Unluckily for Warner Bros., Fox managed to dig through their records and find a document that they were able to make a case with.
Thankfully, an agreement was worked out early enough between the two studios so that the release of this long-awaited movie did not have to be prolonged. Fox executives should be ashamed at themselves for profiting off the creative minds of men and women who they do not employ and for allowing four other studios to attempt to make this film before finally stepping in with their talk of an unpaid buyout, even though Gordon was attached to every single project. It was a low-brow move that I hope is not soon forgotten among the movie-going public.

The high of this election season has begun to fade, and the students of Carnegie Mellon seem to be back to life as usual. As we bundle up to keep warm and shuffle quietly to class, the absence of daily confrontations for voter registration and debate-watching parties may have let our sense of political involvement wane as the new administration has been given the keys to our government.
Just a few months ago, it would have taken sequestering yourself in your room all day to avoid talk about Obama’s newest call for change or Palin’s latest blunder and resultant spot-on parody from Tina Fey. But now small talk has again returned to grumbles about this week’s problem set or essay.
With the historic Presidential inauguration of Barack Obama comes the responsibility of America’s citizens to hold our new political leaders accountable. We have seen how college students were truly able to rock the vote and become a voice that must be listened to and respected. Just because we may or may not have successfully elected a candidate to be our nation’s leader does not mean that our duties as the voting public have ended.
Even during his first few days in office, our new President has already set a number of changes in motion, by signing executive orders to reverse legislation set in place by President Bush. Two weeks ago he reversed the Mexico City Policy and called for an exception to one of his own restrictions on lobbyists. These are not inconsequential pieces of legislation, but rather major changes to U.S. policy.
A historic benchmark for presidents has been their performance over the first 100 days in office. Franklin Roosevelt was able to pass 15 bills during the Great Depression, helping to stabilize an economy in which citizens were rushing to banks and pulling out their money and over a quarter of the workforce was unemployed.
And of course we know that in many of the same ways Obama has stepped into a country in crisis, with his verve and ambition. We must not drift back to our state of political complacency here on campus, though, and trust that all is in order for the next four years. I hope that we will continue in the careful examinations of this new administration so that we may take advantage of the administration’s new sense of promised transparency and hold it accountable for carrying out its duties to the American people.

Along with The Tartan, The New York Times, and the other news sources regularly distributed on campus, a new publication demands your attention: The Weekly Slant.
As the self-proclaimed and self-parodying “only news source that you need to be a well-versed, knowledgeable, and informed citizen,” The Weekly Slant originated on Jan. 1 of this year as a blog at theweeklyslant.blogspot.com, but has just recently entered print circulation on our campus.
In bathrooms, in classrooms, on the counter of La Prima Espresso, on top of stacks of The Tartan — The Slant is seemingly everywhere.
The Slant’s writing is witty, biting, amusing, and is, for the most part, well-written and well-composed.
The articles featured in The Weekly Slant appear to be based in facts but are laden with quotations from fabricated sources, and sometimes the quotations themselves are completely false. For example, President Obama is quoted in The Slant in an issue two weeks ago saying, “it’s time to pretend Change the world!” Even a man whose name is being written in history books is not safe from the elusive “AP,” writer and editor of the publication.
This publication, which is “strongly dedicated to the principles of Humanism, Cosmopolitanism, Rationalism, and Scientific Inquiry,” covers topics that are not only relevant to Carnegie Mellon, such as a somewhat controversial article about SPIRIT, but also local and national news.
Indeed, it is quite amusing to read “news” borne of someone’s imagination, but don’t take anything he or she writes  seriously. While it would be nice to believe the producers of The Weekly Slant don’t intend to hurt anyone’s feelings, even if they did, they probably wouldn’t care. More journalism is more journalism, however, and we are always in support of more news publications on campus.
While the articles may be parodies, they still relate to current events, both on campus and nationally, but give a more sarcastic take on the events. The publication is a readme-esque take, although The Weekly Slant actually makes fun of readme in one of its articles. While the articles may not be entirely accurate, they do convey the author’s thoughts on various topics, which makes it a very interesting read.
Regardless, it’s safe to say this new addition to our campus should quickly gain attention and readership with its sarcastic, witty take on the Carnegie Mellon campus community.

After years of heated debate on the issue of stem-cell research, the FDA’s approval of embryonic stem cell testing in humans is surprising — yet welcome — news.
Geron, a California-based biotechnology company, received approval for the use of embryonic stem cells to treat patients with spinal cord injuries. Although the company had applied to the FDA last March, they received approval only a week ago — a few days after the presidential inauguration. While the FDA and Geron maintain that the timing of the approval of the testing is coincidental, we’re happy that this issue is being brought to light in the first days of President Obama’s administration, making the path for further research much more feasible than it was under the Bush administration.
Former president George W. Bush approved federal funding for embryonic stem cell research only if it was being carried out with already existing colonies of such cells. With less than two dozen of such cell-lines useful for research purposes, this law as good as prohibited embryonic stem-cell research. In addition, Bush twice vetoed legislation passed by Congress to relax the already existing restrictions that were imposed on stem cell research.
The change in administration, however, brings hope to this severely restricted line of research — and the many people suffering from ailments that could be helped or cured by innovations that could come out of stem cell research. President Obama has indicated that he plans to loosen some of the restrictions placed on this field, and that this will happen early in his administration. In fact, he supported the legislation passed by Congress to reduce the restrictions imposed on the field. We’re happy that he is making scientific research and technology priorities in the early days of his presidency.
The new administration is bringing a lot of positive change with it and, for a primarily research-based university like Carnegie Mellon, Obama’s keen interest in progressive technology is heartening. Loosening the restrictions on embryonic stem cell research could greatly help research being carried out in regenerative medicine here at Carnegie Mellon, and also at the University of Pittsburgh, which together would benefit the economy and national image of the entire city of Pittsburgh, as it is centered on research and medical industries. We hope that Obama’s continued interest in science will provide an impetus for research here and elsewhere in the country.

Just as President Obama was being sworn in on Jan. 20, another change was occurring, unbeknownst to the millions standing outside the Capitol that cold afternoon. The online presence of the new administration, whitehouse.gov, was being updated to its current status, a stylish new page that, through a thoughtful design and user-centered layout, emulates the style of Obama’s campaign in its promises to ensure governmental transparency and citizen involvement.
Visitors to the site first encountered the smiling face of President Obama that, when clicked on, linked to the White House Blog — a surprising addition to a resource historically behind the times. With its clean lines and intuitive interface, the new whitehouse.gov appears to be a clear improvement to its predecessor.
Upon closer examination into the inner workings of the site, it is apparent that developers have implemented new technologies wisely when they put together this online resource. Another addition is the use of multiple forms of media to translate the site’s content to the American people. Visitors to the site can view content in the form of video addresses from the president, footage from recent events, and photos from White House photographers.
One change that may not be as welcome as the nice new look, however, is the fact that the majority of content from the old site is missing, seemingly gone forever. After browsing a bit though, you do find that the old site is in fact not lost; each version of the website from past administrations is archived on its respective library’s website. While the past administration’s sites are still accessible, the fact that they are so difficult to find and not reachable by searching the site creates a large disconnect between the presidencies that seems rather unnecessary. The changes in the site also result in the loss of some of the good parts of the old site, such as the discontinuation of the White House kids page, as well as some legacy links that still reside in Google searches and result in missing pages. Overall, however, the site’s update has experienced a mostly positive reception. 
As a tech-savvy generation at an especially tech-savvy university, we are happy to see the administration embrace this new and powerful format for interfacing with the American public. We hope the president and his staff will actually consider and implement the input and content generated by visitors.

Hey Tartans,
I hope that everyone is enjoying the Pittsburgh winter weather and had fun last night watching the Steelers in the Super Bowl. For all us seniors, it’s awesome that Steelers’ runs to the Super Bowl have acted as bookends to our time here.
With Martin Luther King Jr. Day and the historic Presidential inauguration only a few weeks back, I’ve decided to touch on a relevant issue to the current times — diversity on campus. Last week, in one of my Modern Languages classes, my professor asked us each to comment on the following question, “Is Carnegie Mellon diverse?” The knee-jerk reaction is to say, “Of course.” By race, by religion, by gender, by background, by thought — it would seem to me that Carnegie Mellon is quite the diverse place.
But what was interesting was the variety of responses from students in the class as we began to probe deeper into the topic. Can you consider a place diverse if the diverse groups are limited in their interaction? Furthermore, should the university be doing more to facilitate increased collaboration between these groups? Both interesting questions, and something that I wanted to share with readers to consider.
If it’s not apparent, Carnegie Mellon’s emphasis on diversity as a core value can be seen year after year during the Martin Luther King Jr. celebration. In addition to serving on the Diversity Advisory Council, I had the opportunity on MLK Day to attend President Cohon’s address on the State of Diversity at Carnegie Mellon, and what became apparent to me is just how fundamental diversity is when considering President Cohon’s vision for the university.
That being said, a major challenge exists. Only around 10 percent of our undergraduate enrollment is under-represented minorities. Compared to other top-ranked universities, we have one of the lowest yields in this population segment, meaning that the ratio between those people who were admitted and those people who enroll is low. Despite the difficult economic times, I’d like hear more from the university community about creative and strategic ways that they plan to increase the amount of aid offered to these groups.
If you’d like to get involved in diversity initiatives on campus, please feel free to contact me at sbp@andrew.cmu.edu. Pooja and I have a number of additional projects that we are beginning to get finalized including dining and safety changes, a weekend loop bus, and a campus design initiative — we look forward to sharing them with you in the coming weeks. Until then, stay warm!
