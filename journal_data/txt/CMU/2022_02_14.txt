The men’s singles figure skating competition at the 2022 Beijing Olympics has concluded, and with it, the emotional highs and lows have begun to plateau.
The commencement of the short program turned all eyes toward Japan’s Yuzuru Hanyu. Having previously won back-to-back Olympic golds, first in Sochi, then in Pyeongchang, the four-time Grand Prix Final winner was looking to defend his Olympic title. The short program, however, did not go in Hanyu’s favor. According to Hanyu, a hole in the ice caused him to pop his opening element, the quadruple Salchow. Hanyu completed only a single rotation, leaving 9.70 points of base value on the table. Despite this, Hanyu completed the rest of his short program exceptionally, landing the subsequent quad-toe-triple-toe combination and triple Axel cleanly, as well as recording consistently high grade of execution (GOE) scores. Hanyu was one of only two skaters in the entire field to score no less than three across the board for GOE (the other being fellow countryman Yuma Kagiyama). The missed quad, however, was costly. Although Hanyu received the fourth-highest program component score (PCS), the popped jump lowered his technical element score (TES) significantly, and he finished the short program in eighth position with a total score of 95.15.
Hanyu’s performance was followed by Japan’s Shoma Uno, the defending Olympic silver medalist. Though he is often overshadowed by Hanyu and American Nathan Chen in recent years, Uno has always been a formidable competitor and proved it by skating a personal best of 105.90 to secure third place in the short program. Although his quad-toe-triple-toe combination was not completed cleanly, Uno received positive GOE scores on all other elements, scoring the third highest TES, as well as a PCS just below Hanyu.
Kagiyama, who is also from Japan, was a dark horse in the competition. Compared to Hanyu and Uno, Kagiyama came into these Olympics relatively unknown due to his youth. At just 18 years old, Kagiyama had only started competing at the senior level a year-and-a-half ago, but he already has numerous achievements to show for it, having won the NHK Trophy in 2020 and subsequently winning all three events he was entered into during the 2021-22 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating. Kagiyama cemented his prowess by skating a completely clean short program, scoring high on GOE (being one of just two skaters who recorded no GOE score less than three, as mentioned before). Recording the second-highest TES of the short program, along with the third-highest PCS, Kagiyama’s combined personal best score of 108.12 secured him the second-highest qualifying position after the short program.
American Nathan Chen took the ice after Kagiyama, with whispers of Pyeongchang still hanging in the air. However, Chen quickly dispelled any and all doubts, jumping cleanly and skating phenomenally. Chen was one of just two skaters to complete a quad flip (the other being Shoma Uno), receiving GOE scores of fours and fives, and received GOE scores of fives (the highest possible) from all but one judge for his step sequence. Recording the highest TES and PCS in the short program segment, Nathan Chen put up a world record short program score of 113.97, putting him comfortably in first place going into the free skate, over five points ahead of Kaigyama.
Although Hanyu went into the free skate portion of the competition sitting in eighth place, a clean skate would give him a chance to medal. Unfortunately, it was not to be. Hanyu’s attempt at the quad Axel, which has never been landed in competition, was underrotated and resulted in a fall (it was a historic attempt, nonetheless, being the first quad Axel to have had enough rotation not to be downgraded to a triple Axel). This was coupled by a fall on the ensuing quad Salchow. Hanyu finished strong, though, and despite the negative GOE scores and mandatory deductions associated with the two opening jumps, he put up a formidable 188.06 for the segment — the third-highest score in the free skate — earning a combined total of 283.21. Although the margin was impressive enough to beat out four of the seven competitors skating after Hanyu, it could not hold up against Uno, Kagiyama, and Chen.
Unfortunately for Uno, the quality of his free skate did not match the quality of his short program. Other than his opening quad loop, Uno was unable to cleanly complete any of his standalone quad jumps, receiving negative GOE scores for his quad Salchow, quad flip, and quad toe. Although he executed his triple Axel and final step sequence well, the mistakes proved costly, and Uno scored 187.10 for his free skate. This, coupled with a strong short program, would be enough to see Uno take the bronze medal with a combined total of 293.00.
Despite it being his first Olympics, Kagiyama preserved the quality and consistency of his skating, opening with a well-executed quad Salchow and, despite an underrotated quad Lutz, completed his program without significant issue, earning positive GOE scores across the board from there on out. Kagiyama recorded a segment score of 201.93, resulting in a personal best combined score of 310.05, besting his fellow countrymen and securing the silver medal.
As the top qualifier, American Nathan Chen was the last to skate. Chen delivered beautifully, opening his program with a quad-flip-triple-toe combination that received GOE scores of four from all of the judges. Additionally, his precisely-performed quad Lutz received a GOE score of 4.93 — the highest GOE score given during the free skate segment — and he was one of three skatersnot to receive any negative GOE scores during the free skate segment (others being fellow American Jason Brown and Australian Brendan Kerry). Placing first in the free skate in both TES and PCS, Chen’s segment score of 121.41 combined with his world-record short program for a total score of 332.67, earning him the gold medal.
Although Hanyu and Chen have been vying for international titles against each other for several years, it would be a mistake to consider them true contemporaries. Rather, Chen’s contemporary has always been Uno. Hanyu, 27, is from a slightly earlier generation of athletes than Chen (22) and Uno (24), the latter of whom are from a slightly earlier generation than Kagiyama, 18. In understanding this, we are able to better understand the podium’s implications on the future of the sport. Chen’s Olympic gold not only wipes away his subpar performance in Pyeongchang, but also marks a generational shift.
From 2013 to 2017, Hanyu won the Grand Prix Final four consecutive times, becoming the first man to ever do so. Hanyu’s defense of his Olympic title in 2018 also made him the first man in over half a century to take the gold in men’s singles figure skating in back-to-back Olympic games (the last being American Dick Button, who won in 1948 and 1952). Indeed, it would not be an overstatement to say that Yuzuru Hanyu is one of figure skating’s all-time greats, and a legend in his own right.
Nathan Chen stepped into the senior international limelight in 2016, and has won every Grand Prix Final since 2017. That is, he has won the competition three consecutive times (the 2020-21 and 2021-22 Grand Prix Finals were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic), and looks poised to attempt to overtake Hanyu’s streak in the near future. Now, having won Olympic gold, it feels as if Chen has officially ushered in a new generation of figure skaters — a changing of the times.
Although Shoma Uno has never won Olympic gold, a Grand Prix Final, or a World Championships, he has always been a strong competitor and a real contender to best Hanyu and Chen. In the 2017-18 Grand Prix Final, Uno was just a half point away from taking the title from Chen. In the 2017 World Championships, Uno outscored Hanyu by over six points in the short program, and it took a world record-setting free skate by Hanyu to edge out Uno by just over two points in the combined score to claim the title. Just last year, Uno’s six-point short program margin over Chen led to Uno beating Chen by just over a point at Skate America. It is undeniable that although Uno’s international record may be lacking in comparison to Hanyu and Chen, he poses a consistent threat, and his podium position at this Olympics is proof of it.
Despite Kagiyama only having made his senior debut two years ago, he has already shown phenomenal skill. Having won every international competition he’s competed in since 2020 and now having taken silver at the Olympics, Kagiyama represents the upcoming generation of figure skaters — as Chen and Uno did four years ago. It will certainly be interesting to see how Kagiyama develops in both skill and style, as well as the competition between Kagiyama, Chen, Uno, and Hanyu in the future.
Lest he announces his retirement after these Olympic games, Yuzuru Hanyu is not to be counted out. Although Hanyu was not able to podium, his historic quad Axel attempt, as well as his free skate effort, make it clear that he is absolutely still in competitive form. As three stellar generations of figure skaters converge, the sport will inevitably reach even more beautiful and even more exciting heights.

On Feb. 11, both the men’s and women’s basketball teams arrived back home after being on the road the previous week. The teams took on the Brandeis Judges in Wiegand Gymnasium in the University Center. This game marked the first game of the season that spectators were allowed into the game, including both the Kiltie Band and the Carnegie Mellon Cheer squad.
After two losses on the road, the men’s team was looking to bounce back. This game was filled with many back-and-forths between the Tartans and the Judges. In the first half alone, the lead changed three times with the Tartans eventually taking the lead thanks to sophomore Jack Stone. This lead lasted until the half, where the Tartans left 32-28.
However, the story was different following the half. The Judges quickly took back the lead after scoring eight points to the Tartans’ two in the opening of the half. It wasn’t long, however, until the Tartans regained the lead when junior Josh Berry finished with a layup, giving the Tartans a one-point lead, 44-43. This started a massive scoring streak for the Tartans; they would go on to score 14 points to the Judges’ two with almost ten minutes remaining in the second half, making the game 58-45 for the home team.
This didn’t discourage the Judges, though. In an attempt to take back the lead, Brandeis brought the game back within range, making it 75-70 with just over 30 seconds left in the game. Though close, the Judges weren’t able to make a complete comeback, giving the Tartans their 11th win of the season and their fourth in University Athletic Association (UAA) play.
Some highlights from the game include Stone scoring a total of 29 points, going four-for-five on three-point attempts. Junior Kevin Sax went six-for-six on field goal attempts and four-for-five on free throws for a total of 16 points. Sophomore R.J. Holmes also had a good showing, scoring 15 points on six field goals and recording three completed free throws.
The women’s basketball team was similarly looking to break their losing streak, having lost their last five games. After a brief delay in the game’s start due to a fire alarm going off in the University Center, the Tartans started off their game against Brandeis with a small lead over the Judges in the first quarter of play, putting up a score of 14-12. The pace of the game then proceeded to change drastically in the second quarter. With four three-pointers from freshman Isha Nambisan, the Tartans quickly racked up points, putting them up 35-18 at the end of the first half of the game.
The Tartans continued to keep up their pace in the third quarter with Nambisan scoring an additional three-pointer and sophomore Anika Prasad scoring three. Their efforts helped Carnegie Mellon score 21 more points compared to Brandeis’ 16.
Barrelling into the final quarter of the game, the Tartans slowed down their pace a bit, only scoring 10 points in the last 10 minutes. Notably, Nambisan scored her seventh three-pointer of the game, tying the individual game record and helping the team set a new record for three-pointers in a game, with a total of 13. In a last-ditch effort, Brandeis scored 11 points in the last run of the game, but that was not nearly enough to close the gap between the Tartans and the Judges. As the clock ran out, the scoreboard showed 66-51 in favor of the Tartans, moving them to 10-9 overall and a conference record of 4-6.
With her seven three-pointers, Nambisan finished with 29 points on the game, a season-high for the Tartans. Other notable players include first-years Anisha Chintala and Catherine Or, as well as Prasad, all scoring a total of nine points.

Ongoing research at Carnegie Mellon’s Yttri Lab, led by Ph.D. candidate Mark A. Nicholas, could lead to new understanding of the neural activity behind skilled motor activities. On Feb. 9, Nicholas presented his work at the weekly Department of Biological Sciences Research Club Seminar. 
“Individual areas of the brain work together to produce things such as thoughts, perception, and movement," Nicholas said. "The neurons in the motor cortex send direct projections to the motor output areas, such as the brainstem, cerebellum, and spine to direct skilled motor actions. The striatum of the basal ganglia is another part of the brain which works with the motor cortex to produce skilled movements.”
So far, the field of neuroscience has conflicting hypotheses about the brain regions responsible for skilled movement. Some scientists believe that the motor cortex is necessary for learning and executing motor functions, while others believe that the striatum is more pivotal.
A 2015 study from Harvard University concluded that the motor cortex was required for learning a motor skill, but not for the execution of it. This was based on an experiment in which rats were trained to learn a precise motor sequence in exchange for a reward, and after they reached peak performance, their motor cortices were inhibited. The rats were able to perform at the same level as before manipulation, which led the scientists at Harvard to reach a conclusion about the motor cortex’s importance during skill acquisition but not execution.
Meanwhile, another study led by scientists at the Janelia Research Campus (at Howard Hughes Medical Institute) concluded that the motor cortex was required for the execution of skilled motor actions. The scientists used optogenetics (the use of light to control specific cell types) to inhibit the function of the cortex after training the mice to reach and grab a food pellet in a task. As a result, the mice were unable to perform the trained task they had learned before, but were able to execute untrained forelimb movements.
Nicholas stated that the difference in methodology of both of these studies could be related to the differences in conclusions regarding motor cortex function.
On the other hand, prior studies from the Yttri Lab demonstrated the importance of the striatum in selective or voluntary actions. Specific direct pathway (D1) and indirect pathway (D2) cells in the striatum were activated via optogenetics during the fastest third of the movements, after the mice were trained in a specific task. The results pointed towards increased movement velocity after bilateral activation of D1 neurons, and decreased movement velocity after bilateral activation of D2 neurons. In addition, the researchers at the Yttri Lab found the opposite results when stimulating on the slowest third of reaches and concluded that the plasticity of the striatum was dependent on activity and reward. This suggests that the striatum is responsible for gain modulation, which are reward-related changes within the neural connections of the striatum.
Nicholas’s unified hypothesis states that the motor cortex is responsible for the generation of motor commands, while the striatum (the input nucleus of the basal ganglia) is responsible for the gain modulation related to those motor commands. 
In Nicholas’s study at the Yttri lab, mice were trained to push a joystick to a certain distance. When the mice successfully pushed the joystick past the threshold distance, they received a reward. In addition, mice learned to wait for a fixed interval of three seconds between push attempts. Due to the high spatial-temporal resolution of the system used, Nicholas and his team were able to get the reach kinematics, like distance and speed, of each attempt as well. 
Nicholas and his team hypothesized that removing motor cortex function would negatively impact behavioral performance and alter kinematic representation. 
Task performance dropped in mice who did not maintain motor cortex function; they were almost unable to perform the task past the threshold distance, if at all. It took nearly seven days of task repetition for the mice to reach near-original ability.
Moreover, Nicholas and his team recorded movement-related striatal activity every day in the mice without motor cortex function and found a decrease in reach-related signals in the striatum. This meant that as the mice were able to push the joystick, this movement was not reflected nor produced in the striatum. Based on the recovery of behavior in the absence of striatal representation, the researchers were able to conclude the loss of gain modulation.
To provide a negative control for the experiment, Nicholas and his team included an additional sample of mice with inhibited parietal cortex function. Their performance and striatal activity were not impacted, which proved that only the motor cortex and striatum were the areas of importance.

If there comes a day that we can successfully space travel, it could have effects on the functioning of our organs and their components, most specifically our DNA. But how do we know if DNA is damaged? DNA damage is the subject of Associate Professor Tzahi Cohen-Karni's research, for which his lab, along with the University of Pittsburgh Aditi Gurkar lab, recently received a $3.1 million grant from the National Institute of Health's National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). The Cohen-Karni lab, in the departments of Biomedical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering, has been working on studying DNA damage in the cardiac unit since 2014.
"Damage to the DNA in the cells could be due to, let's say, chemotherapy as as part of cancer treatment, for example. Maybe sometime in the future we will travel in space, and space travel will have some effects of the similar DNA, and this may affect functionality of organs," Cohen-Karni hypothesized in an interview with The Tartan. "So this [work is capable of influencing] two extreme ideas like life over here on Earth and our day to day living and challenges, and maybe futuristic ideas like traveling in space." 
Essentially, the cardiac tissue in our bodies is composed of cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts, cells that communicate with each other through electrical activity. This electrical activity is fluxes of ions such as sodium, potassium, and calcium across the cardiomyocyte cell membranes. When ions move, it changes the cell membrane potential, which causes the cardiomyocytes, and consequently the heart, to contract. Cohen-Karni's lab hypothesizes that these ion fluxes, or transients, will change depending on the damage to the cell and its DNA.
To test this hypothesis, the Cohen-Karni lab will generate organoids, miniature mimics of organs constructed of three-dimensional tissue cultures. These organoids are made from induced pluripotent stem cells, which are skin cells that are "taken back in time" to when they were stem cells. Once a stem cell, it can then redifferentiate into any kind of cell, such as the cardiomyocytes that the Cohen-Karni lab uses in their organoids. 
To test their hypothesis, the lab will then examine the healthy cells and compare them to damaged cells. The researchers are creating materials to monitor the intracellular activity, tiny electrodes that can be 20 times smaller than the size of a cell. 
This project is a highly collaborative one. The Cohen-Karni lab will be working alongside Aditi Gurkar's lab, which has many biological tools that will allow them to understand which cells are involved in which processes. The lab will also be working with Associate Professor of Electrical Computer Engineering Pulkit Grover. There is also a large amount of data to be processed in this project. Just one of Cohen-Karni's chips can send gigabytes of data every hour, and to process all of the data manually would be incredibly difficult. Grover will help sift through the data using machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to find the differences and changes between undamaged and damaged cells.
Adam Feinberg, a professor of Biomedical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering, is assisting Cohen-Karni and Gurkar in creating highly reliable and reproducible tissues and cell cultures, as well as techniques to record the electrophysiology of cardiac patients. Carmel Majidi, professor of Mechanical Engineering, will be assisting in developing the sensors used to monitor intracellular activity and the like.
Cohen-Karni believes there are many applications of this research. "I think this tool will allow us to understand disease progression, or will allow us to develop the tools to follow cardiovascular disease on a dish, for example. And it will allow us to test interventions as well as in screening for drugs." 
Cohen-Karni also believes it has the potential to be applied to environmental science, such as monitoring the effect of air quality on the human body. "Sometimes the air is not that great. So you can use devices and platforms to actually learn how environmental effects are or are not detrimental to the human body, under what circumstances they are or not. So it's more than just this single-ended project, to be honest, it's more of a launch [of an] effort."

Carnegie Mellon University hosted the INTERSECT@CMU conference, which features speakers from Carnegie Mellon University, climate experts, private sector partners, and public sector leaders. The keynote speakers included David Turk, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and Zia Khan, the senior vice-president for innovation at the Rockefeller Foundation. 
The conference was held on Feb. 10-11 virtually via Zoom, and each of the panels and speakers focused on a different facet of climate action and the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are the goals developed as a blueprint by the United Nations to foster global cooperation for climate action. The consistent theme across each event was that there is a lot of work that needs to be done on climate action, and not nearly enough is currently being done in the United States. 
David Turk highlighted the importance of climate action from a public policy perspective. He emphasized that $62 billion was allocated to the DOE in the infrastructure bill passed by Congress last November, which is going to be used to hire more DOE workers and create new offices to make more progress towards fulfilling the SDGs at a federal level. He also noted that public private partnerships were going to be necessary to move forward with SDGs. 
Zia Khan spoke on a similar point, explaining that private sector innovation and technology need to meet the requirements to fulfill the SDGs. The Rockefeller Foundation provides guidance and solutions for these innovations and technologies. 
The consistent message was that systemic change needs to happen fast, and it would be disastrous to allow climate change to go unmitigated at its current trajectory. Panelists focused on equitable, inclusive, and affordable solutions to prevent the climate crisis from worsening preexisting inequalities.

With the scale of environmental decay and disaster, it becomes difficult to conceptualize the degree to which these problems affect humans. The best way to do so is to understand the effect of one environmental problem at a time. For this week, let’s take a look at fine particulate matter (PM2.5).
PM2.5 is particulate matter in our atmosphere that is less than 2.5 micrometers, which is 3% the diameter of human hair. The pollutant is small enough that billions of particles can fit in a blood cell. Because of its relatively small size and weight, it is capable of staying longer in the air, which makes it easier for humans to inhale. PM2.5 can come from many different sources such as power plants, vehicle use, and natural disasters. 
High levels of PM2.5 exposure have severe health consequences including aggravated asthma, decreased lung functions, nonfatal heart attacks, and premature death. It is estimated that 4.2 million people die around the world due to PM2.5 exposure, including 50,000 in the United States. Exposure to air pollution also increases the risk of lung cancer and can also lead to plaque deposits in arteries. 
In addition to the health consequences for humans, there are severe environmental consequences of PM2.5, including making water sources acidic, contributing to acid rain, damaging forests and crops, and depleting nutrients in soil. These environmental issues have decreased global life expectancy by one year, with a decrease in life expectancy by 1.2-1.9 years in Asia and Africa. Inequalities in air pollution have also increased. For example, in the United States, minority communities and low-income communities have significantly more exposure to PM2.5.  
PM2.5 exposure is deadly for humanity, and it is indicative of how much work needs to be done in the air pollution sphere.

From A Birds Eye View
Cordae
Absolutely an "album of the year" contender. Don’t @ me. If y’all already knew about Cordae you knew what was in store: a fucking piece of art. And if you haven’t heard of him, go listen to "The Lost Boy," his first solo album, and come back to me. The production is stupid, the lyricism is nasty, the storytelling is incredible. Cordae’s superpower is immersion. Every component of his music is crafted so well and fits together perfectly so that we are swimming in the ocean that is the stories he tells. "Shiloh’s Intro" sets the tone for the album and is probably one of the most important tracks on this record. We hear a freestyle from Cordae’s childhood friend Shiloh Young, who is currently incarcerated, detailing his life up until this point. This is followed by "Jean-Michel" whose production and flow remind me of something off "To Pimp a Butterfly." Something I admire about certain artists is how you are able to hear the influence behind the music they create, yet it is still new and fresh and all their own. Cordae has always been this type of artist. And Stevie Wonder playing the harmonica??? Yeah, that shit is hard.
Favorite Lyric: I was put in this position just to open gates
Favorite Track: Shiloh’s Intro, Jean-Michael, Super, Mommas Hood, Want From Me, Sinister, Champagne Glasses
Slut Pop
Kim Petras
Lmaoooo. This shit is funny, y’all! Is this like some sort of dance pop subgenre? I feel like it is. I don’t know. The whole thing is only about 16 minutes and it really does earn the title of Slut Pop. The transitions between songs are dope asf and are all seamless. It’s like I’m listening to part of a set at Jellyfish or something. The production is actually pretty decent and it’s just unapologetically slutty, which is something I admire about her and this project: it’s extremely honest. I had fun listening to it and if I was drunk I would have had even more fun. It’s a great party record and will make you feel pretty and empowered. What I like about it too is that I think most people actually would enjoy this, even if they don’t think they would. This was my introduction to Kim Petras and shit, lemme listen to her other shit. I’m intrigued.
Favorite Lyric: What’s my name? I’m the Throat Goat
Favorite Track: Slut Pop, Treat Me Like a Slut, Throat Goat
Stoner’s Night
Juicy J & Wiz Khalifa
Definitely didn’t expect a collab album from these two, but I’m not complaining. This shit lowkey hard af. It sounds exactly how you’d expect. It’s infectious and the type of shit I’d blast in the car at 2 a.m. on the highway. If I was in a movie and my character was walking into a casino, I would prolly pick a song off here to play in the background while I make my entrance in slow motion wit a nasty fit. The whole project is reminiscent of early 2000s, 2010s rap at its finest. Y’all remember in "Ratatouille" when Remy ate the strawberry and cheese together and was like this shit bangs? That’s these two together. It just makes sense. This collab also happened at a perfect time considering the careers both artists have had, the influence they’ve had on the industry, and where they’re at right now. A bunch of these tracks are going straight to the party playlist. Just a really solid record all around. This shit is dope, so get your squad together, roll up, and put this shit on.
Favorite Lyric: Now she bout to blow me like a hot bowl of soup
Favorite Tracks: All of them
Heaux Tales, Mo’ Tales: The Deluxe
Jazmine Sullivan
…………. where do I even begin. Jazmine, Jazmine, Jazmine. One of my favorite artists of all time, finally, truly receiving the flowers and accolades she has always deserved. She has always been a powerhouse in the music industry. You may recognize her from the classic "Bust Your Windows," the first song off her debut album. What’s interesting about this record is that almost every song is written from the perspective of other women, and one man, discussing their love lives, sexuality, and relationships. Each tale is followed by its respective song. The STORYTELLING YALL…. is and always has been impeccable. And what makes it impeccable is her choice to embrace the good and bad, the balance between morality and free will, and to really talk about the shit we truly feel as humans even if we think we shouldn’t be feeling those things. But when it comes to those feelings, we really don’t have that choice to decide. Emotions and feelings come as they are whether you like it or not. We are, however, left with the responsibility to dissect those feelings, figure them out, discover where they come from, break generational curses. Her music makes me feel loved. Not by others, but by myself. And that voice??? That VOICE????????? I ain’t even bout to get into that cause that’s gonna take a whole ass other review lmao. 
Favorite Lyric: Who was lying when they told you you was all that
Favorite Track: I like all of them

Scotch'n'Soda’s seven-person cast of “Eurydice,” written by Sarah Ruhl, did not fall short in terms of emotion and entertainment. The show, which ran from Feb. 11 to 12 in the University Center's Studio Theater, retells the story of Orpheus’ trip to the underworld to save his dead wife, Eurydice; this time from her perspective.
The play opens with Eurydice, played by Amber Quinn, and Orpheus, played by Zachary Everett-Lane, getting engaged, which is quickly followed by the wedding. From the beginning, Quinn and Everett-Lane seemed to fit right into their characters; it took no time at all to get lost in their performance. In these scenes, it is very easy to get a sense of what kind of love Eurydice and Orpheus have for each other — it’s overwhelming, though you can clearly see there are still doubts in Eurydice’s mind from time to time.
To me, these doubts lead perfectly into Eurydice’s decision to trust the “Nasty Interesting Man” (Clayton Edwards) who offers her a letter written by her dead father (Quincy Eaton), who we had seen writing the letter from the underworld the scene prior. This letter, of course, leads to Eurydice’s downfall (both physically — down lots of stairs — and metaphorically), and she is now dead.
Along with Eurydice’s arrival in the Underworld, we are greeted by the stones: the Little Stone, the Big Stone, and the Loud Stone (Mia Krishnamurthy, Savannah Talledo, and Abigail Miller-Petersen, respectively). Though they are a comparatively minor set of characters compared to some of the other parts, I found them to be an entertaining group. Anyways, the Stones serve as a chorus to Eurydice’s time in the underworld, stating the rules and serving as a constant reminder that the dead are dead and nothing more.
Following Eurydice’s arrival, her father finds her, but Eurydice is not able to understand that it's her father since she has been dunked into the river Lethe. The actors’ performance clearly demonstrates the frustration of being so close yet so far to someone you love. Though the stones remind him Eurydice speaks the language of the dead now, her father still builds a room of string for her, a touching yet hopeless gesture. 
Throughout the play, Orpheus will reenter the stage, writing a letter to Eurydice or announcing his plans to get her back from the underworld. I thought it was clever to use the single set as a way to deliver information between the overworld and underworld despite it being obvious which world the speaker was in. Who knew a worm was so good at being a messenger to the underworld?
After one of Orpheus’ letters is delivered to Eurydice, she remembers who she is and recognizes the “porter” as her father. The following scenes spend time building their relationship as Eurydice’s father teaches her language and about his past. 
During the relationship scenes, we see the Lord of the Underworld, who happens to be the same person as the Nasty Interesting Man but much more childlike, attempting to seduce Eurydice and failing. I must say that Edwards does a convincing job of playing separate personalities and really sold the more serious demeanor of the Nasty Interesting Man and the childlike behavior of the Lord of the Underworld, and it did not go unnoticed. 
Eventually, Orpheus arrives in the underworld to save Eurydice, with a song so emotional that it makes even the Stones weep. The Lord of the Underworld greets Orpheus and promises him that if Orpheus can leave the underworld without looking behind him at Eurydice, then he can leave with her. He agrees and begins his march to the gates of the Underworld. 
At this point, we see Eurydice debating if she truly wants to leave the underworld and, in the end, follows after Orpheus at her father’s insistence. Eurydice ends up calling out Orpheus, who turns around, and Eurydice dies a second time as her father had warned. 
I would describe the following scenes to definitely be the most emotional in the entire play. Following Eurydice’s departure, her father decides that he can’t live with the memory of her, so he decides to plunge himself back into the river Lethe to forget her. After Eurydice arrives back in her “room” following her second death, she finds her father laying on the ground, silent, having lost his memories and all sense of language. After the Lord of the Underworld informs Eurydice that she will be his bride, she too decides to plunge into the river Lethe after she writes a letter to Orpheus and his future wife.
In the final scene of the performance, Orpheus arrives in the underworld, having died as well. Having no linguistic ability, he attempts to understand the message Eurydice left for him in the same way she had tried to understand his letter earlier in the show, but of course, his efforts are a waste, and the show ends. 
Overall, “Eurydice” was a very solid play and the cast did an excellent job conveying all the emotions of the play and more. From the beginning to the end, the performers were locked into character, which made for a very entertaining and emotional show. On top of the actors, the multi-level design of the set facilitated interesting stage movement, and the lights and visuals really sold the entire production. As such, everyone involved in the production deserves high praise for an outstanding show.

(Spoiler alert: This article will contain some spoilers from the movie, but I won't give away the ending.)
“Once upon a time, on the north shore of Long Island, not far from New York, there was a very, very large mansion, almost a castle, where there lived a family by the name of Larrabee. There were servants inside the mansion, and servants outside the mansion; boatmen to tend the boats, and six crews of gardeners: two for the solarium, the rest for the grounds, and a tree surgeon on retainer. There were specialists for the indoor tennis courts, and the outdoor tennis courts, the outdoor swimming pool, and the indoor swimming pool. And over the garage there lived a chauffeur by the name of Fairchild, imported from England years ago, together with a Rolls-Royce; and a daughter, named Sabrina.”
"Sabrina," the 1995 film starring Julia Ormond in the titular role alongside Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear, has always been my favorite romantic movie. I saw it for the first time in the summer of 2018 on the night of my high school graduation and absolutely loved it. Since that night, I’ve made it my go-to Valentine’s Day choice and for the most part, I keep my little tradition alive.
Now you might be thinking one of two things: one, isn’t there a black-and-white movie with the same name, and two, why this movie? To answer the first question, yes, this film is a remake of the 1955 "Sabrina" that starred Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, and William Holden (who was dating Hepburn at the time). 
And to answer the second question, I would go so far as to say that "Sabrina" is perfect for our time, even though the storyline may sound cliché, and it may be the type of film not suited for those who are easily offended. 
We meet Sabrina Fairchild, the daughter of the Larrabees’ British chauffeur, as a girl who’s spent her life watching the Larrabees’ lives from afar, mainly their lavish nighttime parties. She harbors an unrequited affection for David Larrabee (Greg Kinnear) — the younger, fun-loving Larrabee son, and stark contrast to his business-minded brother Linus Larrabee (Harrison Ford) who heads the family’s company with the vigilance of a hawk. 
Her father, intent on giving her a chance to see the world outside of Long Island, sends her on an internship to Paris as a photographer for Vogue magazine. Initially sticking out like a sore thumb, with no knowledge of French, Sabrina learns to find her way through the city and even has a brief romance with someone new.
While this looks like a classic example of the all-too-familiar makeover trope in romantic comedies, Sabrina’s makeover goes beyond looks. When she returns to Long Island after two years in Paris, Sabrina is certainly more stylish but also wiser and more confident about herself. Julia Ormond perfectly balances playing a romantic ingenue with dreams, a girl who dearly loves her father, and a woman with a strong sense of self. Sabrina feels relatable, and perhaps even a little aspirational. 
Alongside Sabrina’s story of personal growth, there is a second, equally engaging storyline interwoven into the film. When Sabrina returns from Paris, David is engaged to Elizabeth Tyson (played by Lauren Holly), a pediatrician who happens to come from a powerful business family. Tired of his brother’s philandering, Linus is happy with this relationship, especially since it comes with a billion-dollar-merger between the Larrabees and the Tysons. The only problem? David’s engagement to Elizabeth might be in jeopardy because his mother found him “hustling the chauffeur’s daughter.”  To save the merger, Linus takes it upon himself to "deal with Sabrina," even if it means pretending to romance her just to keep her away from David. Except there’s one thing Linus’s plan didn’t account for: falling in love with Sabrina. 
Ford’s portrayal of Linus Larrabee is absolutely wonderful. Compared to Bogart’s portrayal in the 1955 version, Ford’s portrayal of Linus seems much more likable despite the fact that the character is repeatedly called, “the world’s only living heart donor” (side note: if subtle-yet-snarky humor is your type, you are going to love the dialogue of this film). It’s hard not to feel sympathy for him during his moments of vulnerability, especially when he divulges about his past and what makes him tick. His chemistry with Ormond’s Sabrina is more than believable, and watching him fall in love with her is nothing short of beautiful. 
The overall acting in this movie is fantastic, including the supporting cast. No single character ever comes off as a cliché. The dialogue is hilarious and romantic, perfectly delivered without being overly cheesy.
In addition, one of the things that makes Sabrina such a unique film is that there is no real “villain." There is no character with truly evil intentions to break up a couple or destroy a business, just people with wants and desires that sometimes collide with each other. Even Linus’s whole plan is done solely with the intent of saving a business deal. 
Moreover, if not for the chance to see Ford in the shoes of a romantic leading man instead of a scruffy-looking nerf-herder or a professor of archaeology, watch "Sabrina" for the music, be it the enchanting soundtrack by John Williams, or the original song “In the Moonlight” crooned by the legendary Sting.
If by now you’ve felt like "Sabrina" is a film worth watching this Valentine’s Day, it’s available on Netflix for streaming (until Feb. 28) and on Pluto TV (free, but with ads).

Content Warning: The following review contains discussions of sexual violence and exploitation.
As a waterfall of cascading Fruit Loops come into focus, we plunge rapidly into the smooth-chaotic darkness of the first act of Gregg Araki’s 2004 film, "Mysterious Skin." The movie is an adaptation of the novel of the same name, written by Scott Heim, and adapted by Araki. Araki’s films up to this point have been monumental in the development of the new queer cinema movement in the early nineties.* His quintessentially indie D.I.Y. flicks such as "The Living End," "Totally F***ed Up," and "The Doom Generation" all focus on the drug-addicted, sex working, and HIV-positive youth of Araki’s America, a group that was ignored in the popular media and by the government. These films are meant to reflect the outrage of the activists working to spread awareness of the Reagan administration’s inability to respond to the AIDS crisis, not to stereotype the communities that were portrayed. By the late 90’s, Araki was gaining traction and getting larger budgets for his movies, and with that money, Araki casted a striking representation of the AIDS crisis and gay youth, Joseph Gordon-Levitt. 
Gordon-Levitt stars alongside Brady Corbett, and they both deliver truly remarkable performances. These characters are Neil (Gordon-Levitt), a disaffected and self-destructive gay hustler, and Brian (Corbett), a sheltered loner fascinated by the aliens he thinks abducted him on two afternoons when he was a boy. Gordon-Levitt makes quite a different turn for his career by starring in this movie. The then-23-year-old had been a teenage-star, with iconic roles in "10 Things I Hate About You" and "3rd Rock from The Sun." This role was an obvious shift into something more serious and adult, with his following role in 2005’s "Brick" being another teenage role set against a criminal underworld of young adults. 
Neil and Brian were on the same little league baseball team as kids, Neil being the star player, and Brian being the outcast of the team. In flashback, Brian explains to the audience how his fascination with aliens began after two strange gaps in his memory formed during little league baseball games, as well as a UFO sighting around the same time. We then get to hear Neil explain quite a different story in flashback, which covers the history of sexual abuse at the hands of the coach of their baseball team. The Fruit Loops that open the movie are quickly re-contextualized as a final representation of childhood innocence, as we see the coach using them as a tool to make a mess that they would have to get on the floor to clean up. This re-contextualization is a motif throughout the movie, and is used to replicate the feeling of realization of repressed trauma that Brian goes through, as he realizes that he was abused alongside Neil. 
This psychological journey is very effective, and the dichotomy between the two responses to the childhood trauma: self-destructive sense of worthlessness versus emotionally stunted repression, is painted with care and incredibly realistic nuance. Quite early on, the film makes clear to the audience the truth behind Brian’s past, making his slow revelation and journey back to Neil all the more tragic and absorbing.
After the brutal openness of the flashbacks that introduce this movie, the hour that follows often feels like "Requiem for a Dream" meets "Napoleon Dynamite," and that is a more beautiful vibe than you might imagine. The moody shoegaze, yellow coloring, and general midwestern-smalltown-expansive-nothingness combine beautifully with a shocking plot for Neil, who slowly unravels and willingly puts himself into riskier situations, until he is no longer able to say no. The clear depictions of his sex work, filmed with vivid long-take close ups on his face, become agonizing, not to mention the dread concerning the possibility of contracting HIV. This is all balanced with Brian’s slow-moving and mysterious story, which finally meets to give a haunting conclusion, with a brilliant final shot that you’ll be thinking about forever. 
Araki’s dreamy and visceral masterpiece keeps the shock of his earlier films and paves space for a more deeply emotional core that delivers a true ache and heartbreak that doesn’t rob the audience of it’s humanity, instead reminding us of the potential for comfort and release in the darkest corners of experience. A movie I eagerly recommend to anyone who wants to go where this movie goes, "Mysterious Skin" is truly one I think can provide you something profound from its source of pain. 
*In the late 2010’s Araki directed one episode of "Riverdale," and four episodes of "13 Reasons Why."

Carnegie Mellon University announced that tuition for the academic year (AY) 2022-2023 will be $59,864, a 4% annual increase. This is less than the rate of inflation, which grew by over 7% in 2021. Here is what to know about tuition changes:
What is the context of tuition raises?
After last year’s pandemic-related freeze, the Board of Trustees voted to resume the annual tuition raise. Provost and Chief Academic Officer Jim Garrett explained to The Tartan that annual raises generally align with “the average of our private-school peers.” 
In the past 20 years, private universities in the U.S. have increased tuition by an average of 144%. Comparatively, tuition at Carnegie Mellon has grown by 58%. Tartan tuition is over $13,000 more expensive than the private university average.
The past three increases, implemented in AY 17-18, AY 18-19, and AY 19-20, hovered around 3%.
Why was the raise implemented?
“Typically,” explained Garrett, “increased costs result in an increase in our tuition and fees. Increases in operating expenses, personnel costs (faculty, staff, and student employees), costs associated with renovations to existing academic facilities, and additional resources spent on improving the student experience all factor into rate increases.” 
What are increased funds expected to promote?
“About 46% of the university’s billion-dollar operating revenue is provided by undergraduate and graduate tuition (net of financial aid). Tuition and fees cover 85% of the expenses incurred providing educational programs and student support services... The remainder of this cost is covered by gifts and endowment draw, meaning that tuition does not cover the full cost of providing educational programs and student support services,” Garrett wrote to The Tartan.
How did the Board of Trustees decide on 4%?
The trustees look to recommendations made by university leadership. The suggested increase is a product of simulation analysis that considers “the university’s mission and strategic goal [and] anticipated increases in the cost of delivering … excellent education,” according to Garrett. 
Carnegie Mellon groups its goals into three categories: individual experience, university community, and societal impact. The first aim listed in individual experience is Learning Science, followed by feeling connected, promoting health and wellness, deep disciplinary knowledge, interpersonal skills, and learning how to learn. University-wide goals emphasize diversity, inclusivity, “world-class talent,” and innovation. Societal impact focuses on supporting both local and global communities through research. 
What does this mean for financial aid?
Garrett reported that, “Over the past six years, our annual undergraduate financial aid spending has increased 55%, and in FY22, we spent $120.8M on financial aid.” Tuition rose by 12% in the same time period. 
At Carnegie Mellon, 45% of students receive financial aid. The average offer for the 2,619 students awarded need-based grants was $49,988 in AY 2020-2021. The National Center for Education Statistics reported that 90% of students at nonprofit undergraduate institutions receive financial aid. The Class of 2021 reported an average loan debt of $20,353, compared to the national average of $30,600.
“Our goal is always to provide a world-class education,” wrote Garrett. “We recognize the financial investment students and their families make by choosing to attend CMU and are committed to delivering an exceptional educational experience while making it as affordable as possible.”

On Tuesday, Feb. 8, Carnegie Mellon’s University Lecture Series presented a keynote lecture with Soledad O’Brien. The University Lecture Series invites artists, experts, and scholars nominated by Carnegie Mellon faculty, students, and staff. 
The 2022 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Keynote Lecture with O'Brien opened with remarks from Vice Provost of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Wanda Heading-Grant, who encouraged the in-person audience and those joining over Zoom to reflect on the words, actions, and leadership of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Her remarks were followed by a rendition of “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” popularly known as the Black National Anthem. 
Following Heading-Grant's remarks, Carnegie Mellon President Farnam Jahanian praised the student performance before stating there is “an institutional effort and institutional commitment” to DEI. He praised the progress that has been made since the commitments to DEI were announced in July 2020. President Jahanian then introduced Soledad O’Brien, a broadcast anchor and executive producer who currently hosts “Matter of Fact with Soledad O’Brien” on Hearst Television. 
The lecture opened with O’Brien introducing the history of Dr. King and historic misconceptions surrounding the Civil Rights Movement. She discussed his unpopularity during his lifetime and how, until his assassination, public perception increasingly portrayed him negatively as a radical. Dr. King’s platform focused on economic justice alongside civil rights. 
O’Brien showed how misrepresentation of history affects policy today, such as recent efforts in several states to obstruct voting for communities of color. 
She described her experiences working on documentaries about Dr. King, where she had access to primary sources revealing a man who was not inherently a leader, but a man who stood up when called to leadership. She also emphasized the qualities that made him an ideal leader for the civil rights movement, including his charisma and likability. She noted that Dr. King had died planning a program for the poor. 
O’Brien made clear that many of the issues related to race, equity, and apathy that were present in Dr. King’s time are still present today. She also encouraged young people to continue to push for equity and justice, stressing that it is often young people that push for change and have done so successfully before. 
Questions for O’Brien were submitted through a sli.do link, focusing on personal experiences with racism, worries about inaction in the policy sphere, modern hysteria, and what young people and administrators should do. O’Brien offered the audience direct answers to these questions while also reassuring the audience that despite days of feeling hopeless, there is more to be optimistic about than pessimistic. In follow-up comments with The Tartan, O’Brien further emphasized the media’s struggle and “failure” to address complicated issues surrounding racial and economic issues. 
Vice Provost Heading-Grant also commented on the future of DEI, particularly focusing on DEI’s commitment to creating an excellent environment of “belonging” and getting to a place where students are part of a “family.” She also highlighted the “role of education in terms of advancing the needle and supporting students,” and the next step is to help students thrive and be successful through DEI initiatives.

Kristin Donegan is a senior biology major at Carnegie Mellon and perhaps a future Jeopardy hall-of-famer. She has been scouted onto College Jeopardy and will be facing five other talented college students on Tuesday, Feb. 15. You can join other Carnegie Mellon students at the watch party in McConomy Auditorium starting at 8 p.m. and have a chance to ask her some questions afterward. I decided to get a head start on those questions, which you can read here.
The Tartan: Why did you want to go on college Jeopardy?
Kristin: Being on "Jeopardy" has been a dream for pretty much all of my life. Back in high school, I'd watch "Jeopardy" every single day with my parents and my sister. In college, I stopped watching as much, but I was still just as interested in the show. I was just busy with classes. But I got back into it when there were a lot of recent big champions on "Jeopardy." I've also been trying out for the show since high school pretty consistently. And then this year, I finally got in. 
TT: Who's your favorite "Jeopardy" player?
K: I have to say Amy, especially given that she just had her amazing run. It was really great to just watch her. She actually started her run the week before we filmed so me and my fellow contestants were all kind of crowded around my laptop. All with our pens to practice buzzing watching Amy go. 
TT: Do you have to practice a lot to prepare? 
K: Yeah, I have been doing trivia casually, like when I'm home in Maryland, I go to bar trivia with my parents. But once I got the call to appear on the show, I started studying a lot more, pretty much from early October to filming, which was halfway through November. Every single moment of free time I had, I was spending reading old "Jeopardy" questions and making flashcards quizzing myself. 
TT: So I know there's a lot of things that you're not allowed to say due to the episode not being out yet, but how was it actually being on "Jeopardy?" Was it how you expected ?
K: It was really amazing to be on set. One of the things that was particularly nice about being in the college tournament was that it was a big group of all fellow students, so I got to make a lot of friends, all of which I'm still keeping in touch with. Just walking onto the set for the first time took my breath away, especially because they had re-done a lot of the set dressing for a tournament. It was the "Jeopardy" set, but it also had a ton of extra special stuff on it. That was really cool to see.
TT: There's been a lot of controversy about the new "Jeopardy" hosts and who they might be. You had Mayim Bialik, do you think she was a good host?
K: Yeah, I think she did a good job. I went into the tournament, definitely being a fan of Ken and being a little disappointed that it wasn't going to be Ken hosting. But then after getting to meet Mayim and filming with her, I warmed up to her a lot.
TT: So when you were playing "Jeopardy" did you have any specific strategy?
K: I think I can say what my plan was. Yeah, a lot of daily double hunting. If you're not strong enough to take control of the board and know almost every question, that can really bite you in the butt. So I went in planning ongoing top to bottom. And then if that worked out for me, I'd be a little more aggressive later. 
TT: What would your dream "Jeopardy" category be? 
K: My dream category would probably be something biology or medicine related or maybe history of medicine too.
TT: What was the process like in applying and then becoming a contestant on college "Jeopardy?" 
K: It used to be an online test that you could take once per year, they'd be like, We're doing the test, there's these three times and dates. You have to take it then. Then they started doing the anytime test where you can take it any time you want. So I took it in the fall of junior year, and then got an email in December saying I’d been selected for the next round. So then the next round is a similar style of tests, they just have you do it on Zoom to make sure that you aren't cheating. And then if you pass that well enough, then you get to go to a Zoom gameplay test where it's you and eight contestants and you go through a mock game where you get the call categories and play against other people. And then they also ask you questions about yourself to gauge if you can be interesting to put on TV. And then if they like you, they'll be like, You're in the pool. Stay tuned. And then there's 12 or 18 months in which you can expect to get the call. But I was very lucky to get it the first time I made it that far. I remember hearing on set twenty-six thousand people tried out. 
TT: Do you watch any of the other trivia shows? 
K: One of my friends was talking about "The Chase" last night and how there's some contestant on it who was actually a former college contestant who was really doing well in "The Chase." Now that I can't go on "Jeopardy" anymore and I have to start trying out for other trivia shows, I should definitely start watching other things.
TT: If you were to do another game show, where would you go? 
K: For any other game show, we were told when we finished that we couldn't be on another game show for a year. If I had to, I definitely do "The Amazing Race." Me and some of my fellow contestants are also fans. So we joke, what if we make a team and go on together?
TT: What are the stuff that you're allowed to or not allowed to say? 
K: I cannot reveal anything about game outcomes or gameplay. Like, I can't reveal categories or questions or how things ended, but I can reveal who I'm going up against, some behind the scenes stuff about filming, as long as it does not spoil. I basically cannot spoil how the episodes go. 
TT: When you were on set. How much was just you versus the other contestants and how much was waiting for clues?
K: It moves really fast. A lot of my fellow contestants describe it like we blacked out. If you asked me what the questions were, I can't remember most of them. It really goes by fast and it's over before you know it. There are some pauses every now and then, like if Mayim announces a clue, but the person controlling the board accidentally makes a different clue pop up. So then they have to pause it and fix things. If there are moments with a technical error, we pause and there are the commercial breaks and we get to drink water. But during the actual gameplay, it goes by so fast. 
TT: Do they ever make you redo a certain thing?
K: We don't have to redo a lot. One interesting thing is that on the Reddit AMA for the professors tournament, they were all saying how they constantly had to redo their anecdotes because they were too long or too short. But I don't think I ever saw anyone in our tournament having to redo theirs. I guess we just have a good sense for what was like the appropriate length. We had to redo the intro a lot, but I think they just wanted good takes of us smiling. Us actually answering the questions that didn't have to get redone ever. 
TT: And are you going to be at the watch party at CMU?
K: Oh yeah. I'll be answering questions and also saying some opening remarks.
TT: Is there anything else that you think you want to say?
K: I'd like to emphasize, if you can please tune in for the whole tournament because it's just a great group of students. I have a lot of friends who are competing, and it's just going to be really fun to watch the whole tournament, not just me.

Valentine’s Day sucks.
In all seriousness, Valentine’s Day is awful. It’s all about love and romance, but for most people, love does not come easy. It’s a day where people feel compelled to put themselves out there only so they aren’t left out. It can be a lose-lose situation whether you try to get a date or can’t get one.
Valentine’s Day presents a unique challenge as far as holidays go. For many single people, it’s hard to watch all the couples go on dates and spend time together. Do you try to get your own date? Or would you rather be alone on Valentine’s Day? (Cue the “god, you’re pathetic” memes.) Love is a good thing, but having everyone celebrate it at once leaves out those who can’t be with someone they love. Even for couples, distance, work, and school can disrupt even the ahem best-laid Valentine’s Day plans. Valentine’s Day creates social pressure for everyone to add some romance to their life. For star-crossed lovers, hopeless romantics, and single people, it is an incredibly awkward time to navigate. For those lucky enough to have a date, there is so much pressure to make it perfect.
This pressure leads to feelings of dread toward Valentine’s Day. Not that there aren’t actual reasons to object to Valentine’s Day. In terms of holidays that exist mainly to get people to buy things, it is up there with Halloween and even Black Friday. Like Halloween, though, it is only special because of the people you get to spend it with. With Valentine’s Day, there are only so many people willing and able to spend that time with you. There is such a thing as Galentine’s Day, but hell would freeze over before I am able to get any male friends to celebrate it and actually consider how Valentine’s Day makes them feel. This only adds to the pressure of finding or being with that special someone. The heart decorations and chocolate candies are cute, but they’re less satisfying without someone to enjoy them with.
On top of this, life is still going full steam ahead on Valentine’s Day. There’s no day off, but, even if there was, Carnegie Mellon students would spend it doing homework. With social pressure, busy schedules, and the difficulty of finding someone to spend the day with, some people give up.
Now, I know what you’re thinking if you have read to this point. I can already imagine people sending me that picture of Megamind just because I’m a bit of a downer on Valentine’s Day. But I’m not single this Valentine’s Day! I swear! Distance and school make a celebration impossible this Valentine’s Day. I can’t be with my partner unless I’m willing to travel hundreds of miles without a car — on a Monday! The problem with Valentine’s Day is not romance. The problem is what to do when you can’t act on it, and all too often life gets in the way of love on Valentine’s Day.
For a select few, Valentine’s is a great day to recommit yourself to the people you love. It’s all the more satisfying to spend a day with a partner or people that you love in spite of all the factors that make relationships hard.
But on behalf of all the people who can’t be with their partners or don’t have one for this Valentine’s Day, it sucks. Spend it with a friend or take care of yourself. Maybe next time, you’ll be the one with a date.

If we take a step back and analyze the pandemic-accelerated supply chain shocks, we can see that they were inevitable. In the specific context of semiconductors (integrated circuits/transistors/processing units), the disruptions to the fabrication process have demonstrated the need to explicitly define the intersection of innovation and interests. The discussion needs to shift from “semiconductors are vital to everyday life” toward a more grounded realism. Every step of the fabrication process, from the design to diffusion, presents unique challenges that require more nuanced discourse in the public policy sphere.
Investment in more advanced domestic semiconductor fabrication should be mainstream, particularly when discussing strategic competition with countries like the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Trade wars and military buildup do not exist in a vacuum of instrumental modality. Semiconductors, both their capabilities and security, are vital components of communications networks, imagery and reconnaissance satellites, threat detection networks, naval ships, and of course, smart refrigerators. For this reason, the Department of Defense  awarded Intel  a contract to develop, in conjunction with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), new structured application-specific integrated circuits for more efficient and secure military-use microelectronics.
However, that partnership represents only a fraction of the total amount of secure microelectronics and networks that the military, and other agencies, utilize. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) produces the most advanced processors that guide Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lighting II and supplies other manufacturers such as Xilinx  (freshly acquired by AMD). For several CPU architecture generations now, Intel has been falling behind in node technology compared to TSMC, specifically for desktop and server-grade processors. As modern capabilities require more computational power, strategic competition with the PRC continues to unfold in the military technology space.
It is critical that we continue investment in more advanced semiconductor technology to stay ahead of hardware vulnerabilities that stagnant development presents. In 2018, the public became aware of security vulnerabilities Meltdown and Spectre, raising discussions about the penetration process and payload type. While the impact of these vulnerabilities is undetermined, it is well-known that malicious actors can exploit a processor’s internal buffers to extract encrypted information and keys. Aging military technology and the vast quantities of equipment that can store encrypted information mean that potential targets and exploits are likely more numerous than mainstream discourse suggests.
Within this context, I argue that current partnership programs and Congressional funding for domestic semiconductor fabrication are woefully inadequate in addressing the impact of sourcing the majority of electronic and circuit components from Taiwan, which has been subject to constant encroachment by mainland China. The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act fails to address the timeframe in which its lofty ambitions fall subject. Although passed by Congress last January, the act has yet to authorize any funding for the programs laid out in its mandates. As I mentioned previously, Intel is years behind the bleeding-edge node technology that TSMC has made readily available at the consumer level. For example, Intel has finally transitioned from nearly a decade of 14 nanometer FinFET technology to 10 nanometer (which is conveniently labeled Intel 7) whilst TSMC enters the final phases of its risk production of three nanometer node technology. Intel designs and manufactures its own semiconductors, whilst TSMC supplies the physical die to fabless companies like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). All these discussions continue as Congress has yet to agree on how to actually allocate funds to the programs designed to alleviate the issues I highlight.
The one element that permits this lengthy and ongoing discussion is the fact that China has yet to successfully produce highly-advanced semiconductor technology domestically. It has largely been forced to import the more advanced processors from the US and has significantly invested into the design, testing, and diffusion of semiconductors that are beyond the low-level logic chips that it currently produces in bulk. And yet, that certainly is not to say that the current state of domestic semiconductor production in the U.S. can continue indefinitely. It is time for Washington to seriously consider the future of its capabilities through the lithography of advanced computing.

For all the discussions about taxes, government, and capitalism, a lot of people in the United States don’t actually understand any of these concepts both semantically and fundamentally.
For example, if you asked a random person in the street “What do you think about the government?” the overarching themes could be boiled down to the following monolithic statements:
“The government is taking my money through taxes to pay for stuff I don’t want to pay for, and I want the government to keep its nose out of my life. The government makes everything worse.”
“The government is not doing enough for me or my family and it really sucks but there are certain things we need and we need them badly. Someone needs to do something about it.”
“The government should help in some ways but not others. I think there are certain things that the government should just not pay for. There are a lot of things the government is doing now that they shouldn’t do.”
“The government can help the people, but there is a limit to how much and what things can be done. Doing this would not be good for our economy, which is a capitalist economy and not a socialist one.”
Now of those statements, there is only one that actually matters — I’ll save that for the end.
Looking at those themes, it becomes clear that there are many interpretations of government. The modern understanding of government is that it is some distant entity that does something with some amount of money collected by the people it represents. Technically this is true, but it’s not really what government is. By definition, a government is a ruling body of a nation or a state. For the longest time, when problems arose in society, governments would work to resolve them because that was their job. Governments were the administrators for and extensions of rulers. The more successful ones optimized innovation and development. The downside was that governments were only as competent or benevolent as their ruler, and the ruins of many dead societies are clear warnings of what incompetence or tyranny can bring.
Of course, this glosses over a lot of context and ignores the evolution of government and society. However, the core idea of governance is fundamentally the same today. If there’s a problem, the government ideally would implement a solution. But in the modern era, why do so many people think that it’s not the government’s job to resolve problems? That’s where taxes muddy the entire discussion. Taxes are a transactional link between citizen and government, which for the longest time was some variation of the government collecting taxes they levied on the citizens without the citizens getting a say in the matter. Even if they did have a say in the matter, it was very limited and/or large portions of citizens were deliberately excluded.
But this is where that pesky “evolution of government and society” comes back into play. I titled this article “taxes, government, and capitalism” because I was going to open with a discussion about taxes first. But you can’t really talk about taxes without talking about what government is meant to do and how it has evolved. In the modern era, most governments are no longer extensions of rulers because of the permeation of democratic ideals and human rights. To put it more simply, most citizens of modern governments can vote, which theoretically makes governments the extension of their citizens.
With this evolution of government, the tax issue is now flipped. The transactional link between citizen and government became something for citizens to decide, which makes individual interest much more salient. However, this creates an entirely different issue. Everyone has different interests, even if many are shared. In a lot of cases those interests compete with each other, or there are many interests that mean something for one group of people that mean nothing to the others. As a result, there are many things people will no longer want to pay for with tax money, regardless of their necessity.
This central issue has been the driver of thousands of debates around taxation and representation since even before the American Revolution. It makes sense that a group of people that rebelled against a monarchy over its tax policies would want the authority of the new government to be limited on matters like taxation. The severely limited government under the Articles of Confederation was a byproduct of this reactionary mindset, but it pretty much failed within five years and insurgencies like Shays’ Rebellion were happening anyway. The Constitution addressed this by clearly stating that the government can levy taxes but citizens would get to vote for the representatives who decide the intricacies of the taxes (i.e., how much tax money is collected and how to collect them). These complexities of taxation, like the nation, evolved gradually. Similarly, the reactionary colonial mindset to taxes gradually morphed into a homogenized hesitancy towards taxation with concerns about the individual impact of taxes combined with a healthy dose of government skepticism.
Through all this evolution and debate, a key theme has been missed: If governments are meant to be extensions of citizens, that would mean tax money is also the citizens’ money. This is more true now than it was in 1789, but it was never just “the government will take your money.” People voted for that government. It’s their money. Our taxes pay for so many services now, many of which are services that the government eventually realized it had to provide because it needed to. For example, most people reading this probably don’t directly benefit from Medicare or Medicaid (as I assume many of you are Carnegie Mellon students), but your tax money is paying for those services anyway. It’s just fractions of money, and the benefits of having those programs far outweighs the costs. Sure, self-interest is important, but it isn’t that relevant when the government is so expansive that no one can even pinpoint how many services their tax money pays for that they take for granted. If you don’t want your tax money going to stuff you don’t want to pay for, the bad news for you is that it happens already, constantly. It’s been like that throughout history way before democracy. The difference is now that the tax money is yours and you are meant to benefit from it whether you see it or not.
But none of the misunderstandings surrounding government and taxes come close to the those surrounding capitalism. I’d go so far as to say that the misunderstandings regarding capitalism derive from misunderstandings surrounding taxes and government.
First, let’s break down capitalism. A lot of people lump markets and capitalism together as if they’re synonymous, but markets have been around for thousands of years. Barter and trade systems are a great example of this. People want something, and someone realizes they can make that item and sell that to people willing to pay for it. But, others realize they can make and sell that item, too, and so they all start competing to try to get the most buyers. This is just supply and demand. It’s not a novel idea that was created in 1776 by Adam Smith the way many modern economists and institutions make it seem like it is.
Adam Smith, who wrote “The Wealth of Nations,” is known as the godfather of capitalism and for defining free markets, but that’s not really true. The entire crux of his book is actually focused on the growth of nations, which required wealth to be recycled into the economy to continue to maximize growth. The writing itself was meant to challenge the mercantilist system of the time. It also challenged the hoarding of wealth, land, and resources by a small group of aristocrats and nobles. He wasn’t against government intervention, and recognized that government would be needed to provide the necessary services that markets simply can’t provide as much as would be needed to enforce property rights. In fact, he encouraged this. He thought that profit-seekers had very different interests than the majority of people, and that fast profit was a sign of fast ruin. His ideal market system prioritized lower long-term profits and high wages for workers. In Smith’s ideal economic model, there wouldn’t be room for billionaires or landlords because that’s completely antithetical to the recycling of wealth into the economy. I could keep going, but the point of this is to illustrate that Smith’s writing is not what capitalism is.
The capitalism that we are familiar with now is a product of the Industrial Revolution. The structure of firms in the private sector evolved into the corporate structure we know today, where executives split from the workers, and most gains go to those executives. On the other hand, workers became increasingly unskilled as trades were broken down into simpler tasks that didn’t require as much specialization (blue-collar workers) and they were managed by middle class workers who carried out the goals of the executives (white-collar workers). The economy grew rapidly, which was naturally going to happen as more people were employed and more goods were produced and consumed.
However, the economy is just a summation of the activity of the people in it. It doesn’t actually say anything about whether that economy is actually helpful for most people. The blue-collar workers had dirt-poor wages and awful working conditions. The white-collar workers generally fared much better, but were also not paid very well. On top of that, living conditions for most people were terrible; “good” living conditions were unaffordable for most people. Labor movements demanded the government to regulate the private sector and advocate for better working and living conditions and higher pay for workers. Government became increasingly important: because capitalism wasn’t helping most people, they turned to the government to advocate for individual self-interest. This is a significant reason why taxes shifted towards a redistributive approach, particularly with the creation of a progressive income tax system in 1917.
But self-interest is tricky because capitalists want to maximize profit and power for themselves as much as possible. This isn’t new. The uncomfortable truth of human history is that hierarchy has been a central tenet of society. The people at the top will do what they can to maintain or expand their power.
People in power justified feudalism and mercantilism the same ways they now justify capitalism. But this doesn’t change the fact that, at its core, capitalism is just another system where a small plurality of people hold the wealth while exploiting the majority. In a system of competing self-interests, capitalists would also be the ones with the resources to impose their interests, and those interests are at odds with the majority. During the industrial revolution, capitalists ensured that the government would mainly act in their interest and diminish the bargaining power of the majority. Capitalists also convinced a good chunk of people that capitalism is positive through fearmongering about socialism. They encourage the idea that capitalists should be the ones to provide services instead of the government because capitalists would be the most efficient provider of the service. If this all sounds familiar, that’s because this is the basis of the limited government and anti-tax narratives popular in the United States since the 1980s. It’s what drives the four central monolithic themes I listed at the beginning of this insanely long history diatribe. You can also see a lot of parallels between the evolution of capitalism during the technological revolution of the last 30 years and the evolution of capitalism in the Gilded Age.
I promised I’d tell you at the end which of those themes in the beginning is the only one that matters, and it’s the second theme that is listed. There are problems in our society that have real consequences for real people, and someone has to do something about it. All these debates about taxes, government, and capitalism don’t really take away from the urgency of needing to fix society’s problems and helping those who are the worst off even if they obfuscate that urgency. History is cyclical in nature. Societies form, grow, and die, and governments have to do what they can to ensure their society’s survival up until they can’t anymore. The more humans repeat this cycle, the more we learn about efficient survival.
But it says a lot about us that the hierarchical structures that benefited those at the top continue to manifest themselves today, especially with the unprecedented access to information we have now. Does this mean we are doomed to continue this cyclical process because we can’t break away from the hierarchical structures that have defined societies for so long despite all the knowledge and resources we have? Truthfully, I don’t know. But isn’t it at least worth trying something different? We’re at a point in our history where we have the resources, wealth, and technology to fix most of our problems, if not almost all of them. Maybe instead of debating what the role of taxes, government, and capitalism is, we should start asking the people in power how they can look at all the pain and destitution in the world from the comfort of their ivory tower and say with a straight face, “Yep, this is fine.”

Like most every year, I was really looking forward to Valentine’s Day this year. No, I don’t have a partner to spend it with. No, I’m not part of one of those stereotypical groups of single girls who religiously celebrate “Galentine’s Day.”. In fact, I have no plans for Feb. 14 except for two exams and a 9 a.m. Interpretation and Argument lecture. There is quite literally nothing for me to be looking forward to, and yet, I do. Further, I believe that Valentine’s Day is the one day anyone can look forward to, if that’s what they want to do.
On its most surface level, it’s just cute. The concept of a day where the only goal is to celebrate our connections to other people — a very basic part of our humanity — is incredibly beautiful to me. The cutesy pink heart décor serves only to enhance the experience, perhaps leading you to your softer side. People do goofy cute things. For example, this year some of my friends and I signed up for the Aphrodite Project, an algorithm-based matchmaking system exclusive to Carnegie Mellon and a select few other universities. On this one day, we give each other candy and wear cute outfits, just to do it. Valentine’s Day doesn’t have to be expensive by any means. In fact, my favorite V-Day tradition costs very little: a 50-cent candygram.
And truly, what on this Earth could possibly be better than a candygram? In our digital era, the idea that someone went out of their way to dig a bit of real, metal change out of their pocket and write a little note in pen and ink so that you could hold it on a piece of paper and read it and eat whatever chocolate or sugary confection was stapled onto it by hand is so special. Maybe I sound a tad traditionalist here, but nobody who has received or given a candygram can deny how good it feels to do so.
I’ll add a caveat to the next part of my argument, which is that I acknowledge that Valentine’s Day is shortened from St. Valentine’s Day, and that it is merely another one of those Catholic feast holidays dedicated to someone who has been canonized by the Pope. However, I’d like to go deeper and make the statement that celebrating Valentine’s Day, or even St. Valentine’s Day could be interpreted as entirely nonreligious. First of all, nobody really knows which St. Valentine we celebrate on the 14th, or if there even was one. While there is one that supposedly performed a miracle, there’s also one that performed marriages in secret after the Roman emperor Claudius II banned marriage for men who might otherwise be able to fight in his army (so woke of Valentine! Rebellious king!). Regardless of the whole saint debacle, the traditional connection between the day, the name, and the meaning has been traced back not to any religious figure, but to Geoffrey Chaucer, an English poet, where he inaugurates Valentine’s Day as a day for lovers in his poem, “The Parliament of Fowls.”
Anyways, my point is that unlike Christmas, or Thanksgiving, or even the Fourth of July, Valentine’s Day is one of the only holidays that we can celebrate without supporting a cause we might not believe in, religious or otherwise. While the holiday has a significant history in heteronormativity as well, I would argue that, like so much else right now, Valentine’s Day has the potential to and currently is shifting to be inclusive of all kinds of relationships. In a softer sense, Galentine’s Day is a great example of this; we recognize that women in particular do not need to be in a romantic relationship in order to enjoy the world around them, including Valentine’s Day. Galentine’s Day can be anything, although the original version from the hit show “Parks and Recreation” involves a meal and gifts with main character Leslie and her best female friends. No matter how you celebrate it, or what gender you identify with, the lessons of Galentine’s Day remain as this — we can and should celebrate love in all of its forms, including platonic.
I sense that this is where some residual dislike for the holiday might come from; people who are not in a romantic relationship feel like they cannot fully celebrate. I refute this heavily. Send a friend a candygram. Wear a pink shirt and eat some of those god-awful candy hearts. Call your mom or your aunt or your grandmother. Recognize that this day is meant to acknowledge something we do everyday — connecting with other people and honoring them for the joy that they bring into our lives. At Carnegie Mellon, I think most of us can agree that without that friend you call while you’re crying in the library to give you the motivation to keep going, life would be absolute hell on Earth. Valentine’s Day is not just about spending money or wallowing in romantic despair, but rather it is about returning to your sense of childlike love for your friends, or your favorite movie, or favorite restaurant. Valentine’s Day is not about what you long to have; rather, it’s about the people and things you already cherish.

I think that it’s a scam, however if you can do it right go for it. I think there is a lot of risk in buying NFTs, and I personally would not.
-Jason, Class of 2025
I think that investing in any NFTs is a bad idea at this point, but if you were in it early it was definitely worth it. I also think that the concept is pretty stupid with how it’s been used with many forms of media. I get the point that it's a piece of art, but it's not physical, so it's impossible to stop people from copying it, and I think that devalues the artwork.
-Andrew, Class of 2025
They are cool. They are creative. I don’t know, what else is there to say?
-Anonymous
Just like anything it's another way for the wealthy to launder money. There are some benefits but it's nothing new. Artists have been selling art in various ways for a long time. NFTs are kind of unique in the way that there is so much buzz around them and its connection to cryptocurrency of course. Overall neutral. The environmental impact is obviously not the best, but I’d say it just builds on technology and trends that we are already seeing, but can be unique and interesting.
-Marilyn, Class of 2025
To be perfectly honest I am completely against cryptocurrency as a whole. The idea of cryptocurrency where only a small selection of people can mine it for profit is not good and volatile, making it susceptible to shocks. NFTs are just another attempt to create unregulated and intangible assets of wealth that will mean nothing because they are not tangible. It's crazy that this is what people are investing in. NFTs, more like no FRICKIN thanks.
-Sujay, Class of 2022
NFTs... I think they are very interesting but I don't know much about them. I'd love to learn about them but I've been too busy.
-Kian, Class of 2025
I’m not that educated about them but I know there's a lot of controversy because they are bad for the environment. Just because of that I would say I would lean more against them but I'd have to do more research.
-Phyllis, Class of 2025
