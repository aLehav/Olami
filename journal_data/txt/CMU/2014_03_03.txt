This Saturday the men’s and women’s Carnegie Mellon University basketball teams both ended their seasons in a doubleheader at home against Case Western Reserve University. Both the men’s and women’s teams recognized their seniors for all they had done to send them out on a high note. Alas, the best laid plans of mice and men oft go astray and both teams faltered.
The women started off the doubleheader and came out with a vengeance, rushing out to a quick 11–5 lead in the first five minutes. It looked like the Tartans were ready to dominate, with several players slicing through the defense for high-percentage layups. 
After back-to-back jump shots by the team’s two senior guards, Jacquie Shaw and Jennifer Elkin, gave Carnegie Mellon its six-point lead, the Spartans battled back.
Several times Case Western brought the lead to within one point, but the Tartans were ready with an answer until less than 10 minutes remained in the half and a three-pointer by the Spartans gave the visitors their first lead. 
Teams traded the lead back and forth for the next few minutes, each struggling to get an edge. Finally, Case Western went on an 8–0 run and stretched their lead out to eight points. The Tartans were able to keep up somewhat down the stretch and contained the damage to a 36–29 deficit going into half.
Coming out of half, the Tartans slowly whittled away at the lead until junior guard Chandler Caufield tied the game with a three-pointer with just over 15 minutes left in the game. From that point on, the teams kept the game fairly even, trading three-pointers and layups until under a minute was left in the game. After a free throw by first-year center-forward Lisa Murphy drew Carnegie Mellon to within one point, a three-point dagger by the Spartans made it a two possession game.
After Murphy missed a jump shot on the other end of the court, the Tartans had no choice but to intentionally foul and hope for missed free throws. Lucky for the Tartans, they got their wish and two missed free throws by the Spartans and a three-pointer from junior forward Liza Otto gave them the ball down three with four seconds left and no timeouts.
Otto was able to get the ball on the other side of half court before heaving up the tying prayer. Sadly for the Tartans, the ball bounced off the rim and then careened harmlessly away from the basket as the buzzer sounded. Shaw led the Tartans with 38 minutes and 20 points, while Murphy and Otto both recorded double-double.
For the men, the game was never close. The last lead the Tartans held in the game was just over four minutes in as senior forward Rob Mohen and senior forward-guard Christian Manoli combined for Carnegie Mellon’s first nine points.
From that point on, the Tartans had no answer for the Spartans’ offensive attack, with Case Western dominating in all aspects, shooting 50 percent from the field for the game to match a blistering 38.1 percent from the three-point line and a perfect 14–14 from the free throw line.
The only hope for Carnegie Mellon was their three-point shooting, but a rough night shooting less than 20 percent from beyond the arc dampened any hopes of a senior day comeback.
While they ultimately outscored Case Western in the second half by a point, it was far too little too late. 
The only advantage of the blowout was that it allowed each coach to separately sub out their seniors with a few minutes remaining, allowing them to individually be applauded for the service they gave to their schools over their careers. Manoli led the Tartans with 23 points and 10 rebounds.
As each team says goodbye to its seniors and looks toward next season, they are in two very different spots. The women are only losing two rotation players and a dominant season by Murphy gives them hope for the future. 
The men, on the other hand, are losing a hefty majority of their rotation players, and will be looking for many players to step up their game next season if they hope to compete.

Junior Thomas Vandenberg represented Carnegie Mellon University at the 2014 NCAA Indoor Division III Track and Field Championships this weekend, placing fourth in the 800-meter run. Vandenberg was the only Tartan to qualify for the trip to Nebraska to face off against the best track and field athletes in the country.
Vandenberg qualified 11th out of 16 to make the event and was in the second heat of the preliminaries. While he did not finish in the top two of his Friday heat to guarantee his spot in the finals, his third place finals finish, as well as the third place overall time with a 1:51.77, was good enough to get him an at-large spot.
On Saturday, the finals field was slower as a whole, but Vandenberg still shined. His time of 1:52.47 was good enough for his fourth place finish and netted Vandenberg the first All-American honors of his college career. Vandenberg's finish single-handedly placed Carnegie Mellon in a tie for 42nd in the team scores. This event marks the end of the indoor track and field season, but the outdoor season kicks off this weekend at the Washington and Lee Track and Field Carnival.

Pittsburgh is one of the few cities in the country that can boast a top-level team in three of the four major American professional leagues. The Steelers, Penguins, and Pirates are all well-known and highly-regarded teams in their own sport.
The one major sport not well known in this city is soccer. Major League Soccer (MLS) has yet to reach the heights in popularity that the other four sports enjoy, and it’s hard to see the sport having any major development in this city. However, all that may be about to change with the Guinness International Champions Cup starting at the end of July.
This cup began last year, when eight teams were split into groups of two and played out a round-robin format to determine two group winners. The group winners then contested in a final to determine the winner of the cup. 
Returning from last year’s edition are defending champions Real Madrid from Spain, and Italian powerhouses A.C. Milan and Inter Milan. 
The new teams to play in this year’s cup are current Premier League champions Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool from England, A.S. Roma, also from Italy, and Olympiacos from Greece. Unlike last year however, Pittsburgh is hosting a matchup between two of these European heavyweights; Manchester City and A.C. Milan are going head-to-head at Heinz Field on July 27.
This matchup provides the people of Pittsburgh with the opportunity to view some of Europe’s finest firsthand. Soccer has never received high levels of exposure in Pittsburgh, and a top-tier game taking place at one of the most well-known locations in the city may be just the publicity it requires.
The matchup itself promises to be an enticing one, as Manchester City is arguably the favorite for the title this season in the Premier League while Milan is currently enduring one of its worst seasons in recent history. 
Manchester City has the star power, with household names such as striker Sergio Aguero, midfield David Silva, and midfielder Yaya Touré, among others. On the other hand, A.C. Milan can only boast striker Mario Balotelli and midfielder Kaká as players of world class caliber. 
However, it’s a cup game in the preseason for both teams and, more likely than not, new additions to the team in the summer are going to be involved, and there is going to be a lot tactical tinkering from both coaches. 
Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini is known for his penchant for all-out attacking soccer, but rookie manager Clarence Seedorf is slowly coming into his own for A.C. Milan and has set about salvaging something from their disastrous season. 
What this match promises is some breathtaking soccer by both teams, since it is only a preseason game and doesn’t affect their season much.
As for the cup as a whole, Real Madrid seems set to defend their title. They still boast recently-crowned best player in the world forward Cristiano Ronaldo in their ranks and have a formidable running mate for him in his successor as the world’s most expensive winger, Gareth Bale. 
Madrid has been on a tear recently, and it’s hard to envision a team stopping them. This cup might mean a lot more to Manchester United and A.C. Milan than others, as they are the most likely to conduct a squad overhaul in the summer transfer window, and this cup gives them the opportunity to try out formations and tactical plans. 
The likes of Manchester City and Liverpool are looking to gain some additional exposure on the international stage and begin to reap in the money from lucrative sponsorship deals that come with being recognized at this level. 
The likes of A.S. Roma, Inter Milan, and Olympiacos are all big clubs in their own right. A.S. Roma and Olympiacos are having stellar seasons too, but are simply using this competition as means to set up groundwork to exploit new markets abroad. 
They are unlikely to ever be as well known as the others, but competitions like the Guinness International Champions Cup give them a chance to show international audiences that they can compete with the best for all top trophies.
The prospect of viewing such teams live should be an enticing one for Pittsburgh. The city prides itself on being a fervent supporter of each of the three teams it is home to, so there may be no possibility currently for major league soccer to make its way into the hearts of Pittsburghers.
But who knows? One day, Pittsburgh may just add an MLS team, with this cup at the heart of the beginning of soccer in this state and city.
Editor's note: A previous version of this article stated that Pennsylvania does not have an MLS team. The Philadelphia Union are an MLS team in Chester, Pa. The article also stated that soccer would not "make its way into the hearts of Pittsburghers," but now specifies major league soccer.

Jason Collins finally got his chance at history Sunday night nearly 10 months after he came out as an openly gay NBA player. Not even receiving an invite to training camp, many questioned if Collins, who was set to become a free agent at the time of his announcement, would also be the first openly gay player to play a game in the NBA.
The Brooklyn Nets, in what they claim was purely a basketball-motivated decision, signed Collins as a center to a 10-day contract on Sunday and had him on the court that night against the Los Angeles Lakers. Collins’ playing time may be short-lived given the brief nature of the contract signed by Collins. The Nets have the option of re-signing Collins to an additional 10-day deal after this one expires but are then forced to either wave him, likely ending his season, or sign him for the remainder of the season.
Collins made waves when he stepped on the court partway through the second quarter, with ESPN, [ITAL]Sports Illustrated[ITAL], Buzzfeed and many other sports and non-sports news outlets tracking his movements all night. Speaking to a packed news conference, Collins received nothing but praise, which was completely unwarranted from his underwhelming stat line: 11 minutes, 0–1 shooting, two rebounds, one steal and five fouls. Most of Collins’s contributions don’t show up on a traditional stat line, so this wasn’t a necessarily bad night for the big man, but it also normally wouldn’t have warranted a press conference, much less a full house.
In a strange coincidence of sports timing, Michael Sam, the first openly gay NFL prospect, was at the Scouting Combine over the weekend. Similar to Collins, Sam had a huge turnout for his media session. The unknowledgeable observer wouldn’t have been faulted for believing he was walking into the press conference for former Heisman-winning quarterback Johnny Manziel or potential first-overall draft pick defensive end Jadeveon Clowney, not a middle-to-low round player. Much like Collins, Sam’s on-the-field performance was completely unworthy of all the media attention. 
There is no denying that Sam and Collins are more notable for their off-field lives than their athletic performance. Hundreds of players who will likely be drafted higher and/or have better NFL careers were at the Combine from Feb. 22–25, but no one cared. These players have to earn their media attention. The NBA had to make an exception to its jersey sales rules to actually print and sell Collins jerseys to meet the unprecedented demand, even though he may only be on the team for 10 days. His jersey is out-selling many of the NBA All-Stars.
It’s easy to see this situation and think that a story is being created out of nothing. The only meaningful qualities of these players when compared to their peers is their openness about their sexual orientation. Many of us would like to think we are an accepting enough society that one’s sexual orientation is just one aspect of their character, along with their sex, race, and religion, and all of the other factors that determine what kind of human being someone is.
This sense of equality is sadly a falsity that has pervaded our society. Discrimination in America is not as brutally apparent as it once was, but that by no way means that it is not still prevalent in our culture. Just as with all forms of entertainment, sports is a reflection of our own beliefs. Entertainment is designed to appeal to the masses, and no one wants to see things they do not agree with. That’s why it is such a big deal when the social issues that divide the nation are dealt with on a national scale. This type of social litmus test is one of the only true ways to see exactly where the nation sits on these controversial issues.
As much as we would like for an openly gay player in the NFL or NBA to be a non-issue, politics has shown in the past week that social inequality for LGBTQ people is very much still around. The most dramatic and headline-grabbing example of this inequality is Arizona’s religious freedom bill. This bill, which was vetoed by Arizona governor Jan Brewer on Wednesday night, sought to appeal to the First Amendment right to free expression of religion.
The bill posited that any business owner should be free from litigation if they choose to deny someone service due to a conflict with their religious beliefs. The example cited by one of the Arizona state senators who voted for the bill was a Jewish catering company that refused to supply pork for an event. The true protections in this bill were meant to help Christian shop owners, particularly those in wedding-related businesses, from having to compromise their beliefs to serve same-sex couples.
There is a fundamental difference between these two examples. In the catering example, the Jewish owners are choosing not to serve pork to any of their customers, regardless of their sexual orientation, race, or religion. This choice is perfectly acceptable. For the same reason, I can’t demand a sushi restaurant to serve me a T-bone steak. A customer has no reasonable expectation of being served pork if they contact a catering service that explicitly does not serve pork.
The real-life wedding examples are very different situations. In these instances, the owners are refusing to provide a service they would normally give to customers because of the sexual orientation, race, or religion of those customers. The bill would have essentially made discrimination legal and businesses would be able to hang signs in their windows saying “We Won’t Serve Gays,” just like the “Coloreds Only” signs of the pre-civil rights movement or the “Irish Need Not Apply” signs at the turn of the 20th century.
As one might expect, there was a massive uproar over this bill and it was vetoed for the second time, although the first veto occurred mostly because Brewer was protesting the state congress’s refusal to pass a budget. Many politicians — including both Arizona senators — and several businesses, like Apple Inc., begged Brewer to veto, but the NFL had the biggest threat to hold over Arizona’s head. The Glendale/Phoenix area is set to host the 2015 Super Bowl, but the NFL threatened to move the event if the bill passed. This threat was not an idle one, as the NFL previously moved a Super Bowl out of Arizona in 1992 when the state refused to recognize Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as a national holiday.
The NFL is also being attacked for its acceptance of Sam and any other out future NFL player on the federal level. Jack Burkman, a federal lobbyist, went on a local Washington, D.C. news station to announce his proposal to push a bill through Congress that would ban openly gay players from playing in the NFL. Burkman claims that 36 members of the house and six in the Senate will sign on over the next three weeks.
At first glance, this plan may seem ridiculous, but under current federal law, discrimination against employees due to sexual orientation is completely legal. Discrimination is simply a fact of life for the LGBTQ community, as Congress refuses to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and 29 states do not have their own protections.
As much as we would all like to think that LGBTQ discrimination is a non-story, the sad fact of the matter is it’s not. Though Collins’s and Sam’s sexual orientations should be a non-issue, the sad state of protections for LGBTQ people mean that sexual orientation is still an issue in our culture, whether we want to talk about it or not. Therefore, their stories cannot be erased or ignored, as that act contributes to government-approved discrimination of an entire minority.

This weekend the ninth-ranked Carnegie Mellon University women’s tennis team played in the 2014 ITA National Team Indoor Championship. They had a fantastic run, beating 12th-ranked Washington University in St. Louis in the quarterfinals and eighth-ranked University of Chicago in the semifinals before facing Johns Hopkins University in a rematch of last year’s championships, where the Tartans fell 5–4 to the Blue Jays.
On Friday against Washington, the Tartans took care of business against another nationally-ranked opponent, easily dispatching the Bears 6–3 and moving on to their sixth straight semifinal.
Junior Bryn Raschke and first-year Vanessa Pavia set the tone for the match, winning the number-one doubles match 8–3 and getting help from senior Katie Cecil and first-year Nicholle Torres in the third doubles game to give Carnegie Mellon the early 2–1 lead. Junior Angela Pratt, along with Pavia, Torres, and Cecil, each won her singles match to seal the victory. It was a swift win for the Tartans, with only Pavia needing more than two sets to dispatch her opponent. The two losing Tartans, sophomores Brooke Tsu and Elizabeth Martin, both forced tiebreaker sets before finally failing.
Saturday saw Carnegie Mellon dispatch University of Chicago, 7–2, to punch their ticket to their third consecutive finals match. Rashcke and Pavia, along with Torres and new partner, junior Lydia Utkin, continued their winning ways, taking their doubles matches again.
The only real difference for the Tartans between this game and the previous one against Washington was how five of the women took their singles matchups. Pratt, Cecil, Torres and Martin all won in straight sets. Pavia dropped her first set, but then battled back to take the last two sets and the victory.
On Sunday, Carnegie Mellon hoped to revenge last year’s loss against Johns Hopkins University, but a slow start in the doubles matches set the tone for the match that ultimately ended in more heartbreak for the Tartans. Pavia and Raschke continued their doubles winning streak, but required a tiebreaker to pull out the win. Utkin and Torres had a bad day, getting destroyed 1–8.
The Tartans tried to mount a comeback in the singles matches, but Tsu and Pratt fell in straight sets. Pavia, being in the opposite position from the day before, won her first set before dropping the next two, clinching the victory for the Blue Jays, who ultimately went on to win 8–1 after sweeping the rest of the singles matches.
While this loss is a disappointment for the team, they still have the outdoor season ahead of them as they work toward the UAA Championships in late April.

On Friday and Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon University men’s and women’s track and field teams competed in the University Athletic Association (UAA) Indoor Track and Field Championships, hosted by Brandeis University.
The men’s team put up a strong overall performance, placing second as a team and bringing home two individual titles.
By far, the strongest event for the men was the shot put, where senior Zachary Erra-Hernandez defended his title and became a three-time UAA Champion, winning with a distance of 16.13 meters. 
Junior Gino Pilato and senior Nathan Cheek also placed, taking fourth and fifth place with throws of 14.14 and 14.01 meters, respectively.
Junior Thomas Vandenberg continued his monster season, taking home a UAA title in the 800–meter run. 
Vandenberg beat his own school record with a time of 1:53.32. He leads the Tartan hopefuls for the NCAA Championships taking place on March 14–15 at Nebraska Wesleyan University. 
Vandenberg is a practical shoo-in to qualify for the 800-meter run due to his current third overall ranking in the nation.
Carnegie Mellon had a great showing in the track events, placing in the one-mile run, 3,000-meter run, the 4x400-meter relay, and twice in the 55-meter hurdles, in addition to Vandenberg’s 800-meter win.
In the field events, the Tartans weren’t quite as dominant, only taking fourth place in both the pole vault and long jump to go along with their shot put wins.
The women had a much tougher weekend, finishing sixth as a team with no individual wins.
Senior Jacqueline Guevel was the driving force for the Tartans, participating in four events and placing in three. 
Guevel took third place in the 55-meter hurdles with a time of 8.64 and sixth in the 55-meter dash with a time of 7.56 seconds. 
Guevel, along with junior Sasha Spalding and first-years Ariel Tian and Emily Swanson, helped carry the 4x400-relay team to a sixth-place finish, crossing the line with a time of 4:11.10.
Spalding pulled her share of the load in the field events as well, placing sixth in the long jump with a 4.91-meter leap and a fourth place finish in the shot put. The 10.81-meter throw was also a career best for Spalding.
The top-placing individual performer for the Tartans was first-year Rebecca Fortner, who placed second in the high jump, leaping over the bar set at 1.58 meters. 
This great jump helped her earn the first of hopefully many All-UAA honors for her career.
The women’s team is unlikely to get any NCAA Championship nods, but will be back in competition after spring break at the Washington and Lee Track and Field Carnival on March 21 at Washington and Lee University.

It’s that time of year again … room selection!  Whether you think you are certain of what you want or are totally clueless, it is important to know your options.
First and foremost, it's important to check that you are eligible for room selection. Generally, only first-year, sophomore, and junior residents who currently reside in campus housing may participate in room selection.
If you're eligible, you should be aware that there are four phases of room selection. Two selection phases have passed, but two phases are still coming up.
The first phase is retention. Retention is a process through which residents in retainable rooms can opt to select that same room again for the next academic year. Who is eligible for this phase? Most sophomore and junior students who are not in special interest housing, a first-year area, or an RA/CA room are eligible to retain.  
The second phase is pull-ins. Pull-ins is a process that involves at least two residents — a person who retained his or her room, and the person who wants to live with him or her. Who is eligible? A pull-in can be anyone who is eligible to participate in room selection who has not already selected an assignment for the 2014–2015 academic year.
The third phase is block housing. Block housing is a process that allows groups of friends or residents — 6 to 12 students — of a living community to select a "block" of apartments or rooms near each other in a variety of locations. Who is eligible? Any resident eligible for Room Selection who has not yet selected a housing assignment for the 2014–2015 academic year may participate.
The fourth and final phase is general room selection. This is the process where all remaining eligible residents who haven't yet selected a room choose from the remaining available spaces. Who is eligible? Anyone who is a student who has not yet selected a housing assignment may participate.  
It is important to understand that you pick just one phase of room selection. Once a phase is complete, you are finished. It is as simple as that. Get started today by going to www.cmu.edu/housing!
If you have any questions at all, Housing Services invites you to ask by emailing rmassign@andrew.cmu.edu or visiting the Housing Office at Morewood Gardens.
Important Upcoming Deadlines:
Block Housing
March 26 and 27
Group representatives will be notified of their specific selection date and time and location for their group.
General Room Selection
March 28, 2014 at 12 p.m. — Deadline to apply for General Room Selection
March 31 and April 1, 2, and 3, 2014 — General room selection online; specific times to be announced
Editor's note: Mikahla Vicino is a room selection assistant for Housing and Dining Services.

From 1955 to 1972, the governments of the Soviet Union and the United States captivated the world and inspired a generation. From the Russians launching Sputnik 1 on Oct. 4, 1957, to the United States landing Apollo 11 and the first humans on the moon on July 20, 1969, the limits of human exploration and scientific accomplishment were pushed to bounds never before seen.
Now, NASA has slowly crumbled due to budget cuts and, unfortunately, space exploration has lost its former buzz. The governments of the United States and Russia have stepped down from the podium, setting the stage for the next pioneer of the universe: the private sector.
Companies like Google and SpaceX have incentivized some of the brightest minds in the world to tackle the challenge of space exploration in part by offering prizes for reaching milestones. Google’s Lunar XPRIZE is the latest competition, with almost 20 private companies entered. This prize awards over $30 million in winnings to companies able to achieve specific goals pertaining to lunar exploration. The grand prize is $20 million to the first team that can successfully land a rover on the moon and navigate 500 meters with it.
However, before the final countdown to the moon begins, Google will award $1.75 million in Milestone Prizes to companies that can demonstrate technical goals in landing, mobility, and imaging. Last week, two of the 19 teams entered in the competition were announced to qualify to potentially receive awards in all three categories. One of them is Carnegie Mellon’s spinoff company: Astrobotic Technology Inc.
The Team
Astrobotic, a Pittsburgh-based company run by John Thorton, has a 12-man team, some of whom are Carnegie Mellon students and faculty. Headed by Red Whittaker — Fredkin University research professor of the Robotics Institute and director of the Field Robotics Center — they lead the work on the lunar rover and provide significant contributions to the mission.
Speaking about the vision Astrobotic follows, Thornton said, “A big part of our mission is democratizing space and the moon. It is about creating the moon as the next continent to the world. It is about bringing the moon closer to all of us. We need to learn to live off of this planet. We need to identify where the resources are and harvest them. We need to create an off-Earth economy and start to spread into space.”
Carnegie Mellon’s goals are also as spectacular in nature. “Carnegie Mellon never does anything just for a prize,” Whittaker said. “There is always a higher purpose. It will be to build a future of space robotics. All technological challenges are the same in that way. There was a time when the world didn’t believe a computer could defeat a human chess champion, and so Carnegie Mellon went after that. Space is the next destination and it is a substantial technological challenge. Whether you look at computer chess playing, flying in the early days, driver-less racing, or moon exploration, there is nothing easy about it. You don’t do these things because they are easy.”
Since the beginning of space exploration, there have only ever been two robots that have traversed the lands on the moon; one of them came from China and the other came from the Soviet Union. However, these missions were both carried out with extensive amounts of resources and time. Illustrating the monumental accomplishment Carnegie Mellon students and faculty are chasing, Whittaker said, “The Soviets and China each put more than a decade into [their missions]. If you count the people that touched it, there were hundreds of thousands. Moreover, the money is in the billions. You have to think, by comparison, very highly of this community [at Carnegie Mellon] that doesn’t have that decade and doesn’t have those billions and doesn’t have that army of hundreds of thousands getting it done.”
The majority of the work on the rover is done by Carnegie Mellon students enrolled in the course 16-865, Advanced Mobile Robot Development. While this class only meets officially once a week, the members of the team invest hundreds of hours each month into perfecting the design and building the rover to ensure that everything will go smoothly for when the launch day comes. During the class, Whittaker stressed the necessity of attention to detail when he said, “Imagine if you had only one shot in all of eternity to get your dream done. You can’t leave anything for granted.”
While many people on the team are upperclassman and graduate students with years of experience, there are also many younger members learning on the job. Jake Tesler, a first-year electrical and computer engineering major, joined the course last semester with little to no experience in robotics. However, with work and guidance, Tesler is now making contributions to the avionics that go behind the rover. 
The Mission
Whittaker maintained that while $20 million cashed into the bank would be gratifying, the true excitement lies in the exploration of the moon. Whittaker said, “It is authentic exploration. XPRIZE pays you for driving around in the dirt anywhere you want to go. However, that’s not enough for us. We go for the discovery, for the science and for the exploration.”
“There are very real motivations,” he continued. “One of the reasons the moon is our destination is because of the exploration of the pits. These pits are holes which collapsed in. The things that are new on the moon are the water, the ice, and the pits. For decades exploration has looked at rocks, dust, and gravity, but has missed all together the great prize [the pits]. The pit of interest is the size of Heinz Field and as tall as the Statue of Liberty. Many hypotheses for life on extraterrestrial bodies suggest that would likely exist underground. Additionally, one of the collapsed walls has a ramp and so there are some wild scenarios, of course, for what could explain this.”
The current goal for the team commanding the mission is to land the rover on the moon, drive it 500 meters to collect the XPRIZE, and then begin exploration and examination of the pit. This is a scientific discovery that has never been accomplished. The last generation was able to find pride, joy, and inspiration in NASA’s mission to land on the moon. While NASA may no longer be the force that it once was, Astrobotic could be the hero of this generation. Employees, students, and faculty at Carnegie Mellon and Astrobotic are working to accomplish a potentially game-changing goal that could inspire generations to come, and prove that not only is there so much left to accomplish, but also that if you reach high enough for huge dreams, you can grab them.

Geckos are the closet thing to a real life Spiderman — they can climb up walls and run across ceilings with extreme agility and quickness. 
Carnegie Mellon’s Metin Sitti, head of Carnegie Mellon’s NanoRobotics Laboratory and professor of mechanical engineering, with courtesy appointments in biomedical engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and the Robotics Institute, has been working with his research teams on developing adhesive material that mimics the stickiness of geckos’ feet for the past decade. 
Besides having adhesive feet, geckos also have the amazing ability to clear their feet of dust by walking on a clean surface. Similarly, Sitti and his team showed in their recent publication on Feb. 19 in the Interface Journal of the British Royal Society how their previously developed adhesive material can be cleaned using a similar technique, allowing their tape to be reusable.
Over 12 years ago, when Sitti was completing his postdoctoral research at the University of California, Berkley, he was approached by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to work on developing climbing robots. In 2000, Keller Autumn, a professor of biology at Lewis & Clark College, published in Nature his research explaining how gecko feet were a smart adhesive that were controlled mechanically and not chemically. Sitti’s specialty is small robots, but when he came to Carnegie Mellon, his project translated into developing an adhesive that mimics gecko feet.
Sitti described the project as “mimicking nature in mechanics” by “replicating nature using synthetic materials.”
He explained that between 2006 and 2009, he and his team had a number of publications explaining their success in developing a tape-like adhesive “that could stick to surfaces with no chemical additives, purely based on mechanical design similar to gecko feet.” In 2009, Sitti commercialized their product through a Carnegie Mellon spinoff company called nanoGriptech to incorporate their adhesive technology into a wide variety of applications.
Similar to how geckos have patches of hair on their feet and folds that contribute to their stickiness, the adhesive that Sitti and his team created was mechanically designed to have fibers with mushroom-tipped structures at the end that act as suction cups. The small-scale physics between the suction cups and the surface allows the adhesive to stick to the surface very well with no chemicals involved. Currently, the adhesive can support up to one kilogram per centimeter squared.
Tape, one of the most commonly used adhesives, can only be used once because it is prone to getting dirty. Similarly, gecko feet and the adhesive the research team developed can also get dirty. Sitti shared that they recently “took upon the challenge of making their product reusable so it would be comparable to Velcro.”
Sitti said that their adhesive could be dipped in water, which would remove all dirt particles. But what if one does not have water at hand?
When gecko’s feet get dirty, and they find a lessened ability to stick to surfaces, they climb onto a clean surface and shed particles. Sitti explained that “biologists theorized that geckos have patches of hairs, but more importantly, gaps in between the hairs that dirt particles roll in between.” In addition, “fiber hair thickness was important because particles smaller than the fibers would be harder to get rid of.”
Based on these guidelines, Sitti and his team slightly modified their mechanical design and showed that their adhesive could be cleaned in a similar way.
Sitti explained that geckos use a load-drag-unload cleaning technique where “they first load their feet onto a surface, drag their feet slightly backward generating friction, and then release their feet to make their next step.” 
The adhesive was exposed to silica beads and, using this technique, could be cleaned and returned to full functionality.
He believes that one of the great things about the project is that this mechanical model has actually helped scientists confirm their theory of how geckos clean their feet by examining the technique close up on the adhesive.
“This has been a very international project,” Sitti said. He and his team have collaborated with Hendrik Hoefscher and Michael Rohrig of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. Members of the Carnegie Mellon team include Uyiosa Abusomwan,  Ph.D. candidate in mechanical engineering, and Yigit Menguc, a former Ph.D. student with Sitti and current postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University.
Sitti was proud to announce that Abusomwan was awarded first place last week at the Adhesion Society’s Annual Conference in San Diego for best poster. The poster highlighted the gecko adhesive’s ability to clean and be reused. Sitti humbly believes that the credit for the success of their work should go to his students.
The adhesive has many widespread uses, from gloves to medical applications involving anything with temporary adhesion. Sitti shared his vision to use it to hang things up on walls. With the adhesive’s now reusable feature, an indecisive person could move a picture around their house and try multiple locations.
His team is now exploring uses of the adhesive in robotic manipulation, where it can be used to pick and place complex and fragile parts. For example, on an assembly line for televisions, parts must be carefully picked up and placed. Since no chemicals are involved, the adhesive would not leave any residue on the product. The gecko adhesive could potentially be attached to a balloon, which would adjust shape, providing softness when picking up fragile objects.

As Henry Wadsworth Longfellow once said, “Music is the universal language of mankind.” This Saturday, Mar. 1, 64 musicians from across the globe were united through a virtual concert that was broadcast in Rashid Auditorium in the Gates Center.
Roger Dannenberg, professor of computer science, art, and music at Carnegie Mellon, was the “semiconductor” of the group, which is called the Global Network Orchestra and featured musicians from North America and Europe, as well as from New Zealand, Malaysia, Iceland, India, Turkey, and Australia. The universal musicians used their laptops to simultaneously perform together while Dannenberg conducted the group virtually from the Ammerman Center at Connecticut College.
Dannenberg emphasized in his opening statement that the Global Network Orchestra embodies the idea that everyone around the world is connected: “It helps us realize we are all brothers and sisters, no matter how far away or seemingly different we might be.”
But how could 64 musicians from around the world be synced together, especially with the amount of precision needed to perform in a concert together?
“There are several things that all have to work: cross-platform software, simple user interfaces, and low-latency robust networking,” Dannenberg said in an email. Streaming would be far too inefficient, so Dannenberg and Tom Neuendorffer — co-creator of the project and a principal engineer at Carnegie Speech, a developer of software for assessing and teaching spoken language skills — created a system which allowed the musicians to transmit audio information in a way that uses much less bandwidth than streaming.
Dannenberg explained that instead of having each musician send and receive streams of audio, which would take an enormous amount of bandwidth, the audio generated by each musician is decomposed into a pitch and a loudness, which only takes a few bytes.
“Each player receives the pitch and loudness information from every other player and reconstructs the audio with a local synthesizer, saving the need to transmit or receive streams of audio,” Dannenberg said. “The synthesis is based on samples that are shared and downloaded by all the performers before the concert.”
“Another challenge, which is more musical than technical, is the speed of light. The delays impose some limits on how well you can synchronize, and therefore influence what kinds of music it makes sense to perform,” Dannenberg said.The pieces performed are as follows: “Prayer for Peace,” which was composed by Dannenberg himself; “Grant Us Peace,” a Bach chorale from BWV 42; “Riffs and Drums,” a conducted improvisation led by Dannenberg; and finally, “Dona Nobis Pacem.”
Janelle Burdell, a professional drummer and percussionist, performed live in the Rashid Auditorium as the featured musician of “Riffs and Drums.” Two other renowned musicians who performed as part of the Global Network Orchestra include Pauline Oliveros, a well-known American composer, and Scot Gresham-Lancaster, a pioneer of networked and telematics music.
As with all performances, the Global Network Orchestra faced a few technical difficulties. For example, there were supposed to be 100 musicians total, but due to network connection issues, only 64 musicians participated. As Dannenberg joked at the end of the performance, though, “64 is 100 in base 8!”
While the idea of a virtual orchestra is still novel, the Global Network Orchestra’s performance confirms that it is not only entirely possible, but is a concept that may continue to grow in the future.

The ability to quickly fall asleep and remain asleep after a long day is something that many people take for granted. Sleep disorders, however, can disturb this natural phenomenon and cause a variety of unpleasant side effects that can hinder an individual’s ability to properly function.
Insomnia, or difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, is a common disorder that affects many individuals worldwide. According to the Sleep Health Foundation, up to 10 percent of adults are affected by insomnia at any given time. Insomnia is influenced by a variety of factors, including traits such as gender and age; women and seniors over age 60 are particularly susceptible to bouts of insomnia. In addition to difficulty falling and staying asleep, individuals with insomnia can experience a variety of side effects such as fatigue, headaches, and anxiety. Lack of sleep can also feed into more serious problems, like depression, and can increase risk of stroke or diseases, like diabetes.
Insomnia can be split into primary and secondary insomnia. Primary insomnia is not caused by an external factor like stress or another health problem. Primary insomnia is further categorized into psychophysiological, idiopathic, and paradoxical insomnia. Psychophysiological insomniacs are individuals who worry about falling sleep. Their fear of not being able to fall asleep ironically prevents them from sleeping. Idiopathic insomniacs are individuals whose insomnia developed early in life and persists as a lifetime disorder. Paradoxical insomniacs are insomniacs who are unable to sleep, but experience no other symptoms of insomnia,   like fatigue or anxiety.
Secondary insomnia is caused by an external factor. This could be anything from a stressful day at work, a shift in schedule, or a health concern such as bipolar disorder. According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, about 80 percent of people who experience insomnia have secondary insomnia. Secondary insomnia generally goes away without treatment if the cause is removed.
Insomnia can also be categorized by the length of time it is experienced. Transient, acute, and chronic are the three main classifications of insomnia based on duration. Transient insomnia lasts for a few days, and is generally caused by a specific event or circumstance, such as an upcoming deadline or stressful occasion. Acute insomnia is also short-term, but it generally lasts for several weeks. These short-term forms of insomnia are usually treated with lifestyle changes. Avoiding food, caffeine, and exercise before going to sleep; keeping your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool; as well as having a regular sleep schedule can help prevent short-term insomnia.
Chronic insomnia is long-term insomnia. According to howstuffworks.com, chronic insomnia occurs when an individual is unable to sleep for six hours a night at least three nights a week over the duration of 30 days. Treatment for chronic insomnia includes various techniques in addition to lifestyle changes. One major treatment is cognitive behavioral therapy, which attempts to reduce worry and anxiety about going to sleep. Other treatments involve therapy to alter the way the individual perceives their bed and reduce psychological stress associated with sleep. In addition to behavioral therapy, chronic insomnia can also be treated with over-the-counter or prescription medication.
Insomnia, whether moderate or severe, is a significant medical condition that can have a dramatic impact on various aspects of an individual’s life. As researchers continue to better understand the brain and the way that sleep works, new discoveries are constantly altering the way we understand insomnia and improving the methods used to treat the disease.

You may have heard of Bitcoin in the last few months, as it has shown up in stories of illicit drug marketplaces, overnight millionaires, and massive heists. What are Bitcoins, and why have they gotten people so excited?
Bitcoin first appeared in 2008 with an academic paper published under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The paper described a way in which multiple users could agree on the contents of a list of messages, called the blockchain. New messages could only be added to the blockchain if the majority of users agreed to put them in, and no one could take down the blockchain unless they could take down a majority of the users. The paper also described a way of using the blockchain to track the ownership of virtual coins. New coins would be assigned to the users who maintained the blockchain, based on how much work they contributed to the effort. Users could then transfer ownership of their coins to others by adding a new message to the blockchain stating their desire to do so. They signed the message with a special “digital signature,” showing that the message was really from them. Once the message was added to the blockchain, it would be visible to everyone, so that all of the users could agree on the ownership of the coins. Nakamoto published an open source program to implement these ideas, and Bitcoin was born. 
Since then, speculation on Bitcoins has been rampant. It is not uncommon for the price of Bitcoins to double or halve over a single day. As of Mar. 1, 2014, Bitcoins were selling at $568, down from a high of $1,124 a few months before. Bitcoin evokes a question: Why are people willing to trade real dollars for virtual coins? At its core, currency derives its value from the expectations that others will accept it in exchange for goods. Even though paper dollars are not a particularly useful good themselves, a social agreement on their value arises from the fact that it is much easier to trade using paper dollars than to trade by bartering with actual goods, like iPods and bagels.
U.S. dollars have a big advantage in that the U.S. has promised to accept dollars as payment for fines and taxes. However, trading in U.S. dollars also has drawbacks, especially in an electronic and global market. There is no guarantee that the United States will not print more money, making dollars less valuable, but with Bitcoin there are guarantees on the number of new Bitcoins created. Transferring dollars between people within the U.S. requires meeting in person, waiting three to five business days on bank transfers, or giving up three percent of transactions to credit card companies. Transferring money between countries becomes even more complicated, costly, and slow. Bitcoin allows users to transfer coins to anywhere in the world with almost no fees, and to do it within 10 minutes. It is not surprising that many companies — such as WordPress, Reddit, and OKCupid, according to Nasdaq — like the idea of using Bitcoins over dollars, when it means getting their money faster and more reliably without shelling out three percent to credit card companies. For these reasons, many consumers and merchants are willing to trade in some dollars for Bitcoins, in exchange for having these conveniences. Bitcoins could increase prosperity for everyone by improving trade through the smoother transfer of money, but is the smoother transfer of money worth the costs? Bitcoin can be used as the online equivalent of cash, allowing users to buy illegal goods, avoid taxes, and circumvent sanctions with anonymity. Bitcoin raises the question: What are the repercussions of a society where all money is anonymous?
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on Bitcoin.

Past humans may have spent 10,000 years on ice bridge
Recent genetic and environmental evidence suggests that early humans may have spent around 10,000 years on the Bering land bridge before moving into the Americas.Most paleontologists assumed the Bering land bridge had been an inhospitable tundra steppe and that humans would not have stayed long there. However, drilled sediment from under the Bering sea indicates that the land bridge may have had shrubs, or even trees. Other evidence around this time indicates that ice sheets covered much of America, thus isolating the land bridge. Genetic analysis also supports the hypothesis. By looking at mitochondrial DNA, which is only passed down through the mother, it was determined that Native Americans became a genetically distinct population around 25,000 years ago but did not actually migrate into the Americas until around 15,000 years ago.

U.K. proposes legislation to allow embryo donations
The U.K. government has proposed legislation that may allow the DNA of a healthy donor to be implanted into an embryo of two other parents. The procedure would allow women who have mitochondrial diseases to have healthy children. In the procedure, the mitochondria in the embryo is swapped with a healthy donor’s mitochondria; this process causes some mitochondrial DNA to also be transferred to the embryo.This form of alteration could be passed down through generations. Currently, U.K. legislature forbids the genetic alteration of human eggs or embryos. The U.K. has been evaluating the medical and social issues surrounding the procedures since 2011, when scientists claimed the technique was ready for human trials.

Eating device may help patients who have hand tremors
A new study released by the University of Michigan shows that a hand tool can help patients overcome tremors and eat normally. The study included 15 patients with moderate-to-severe tremors and showed that the device — developed by Anupam Pathak, CEO of San Francisco-based startup firm Lift Labs — could stabilize the tremors enough for patients to be able to keep a spoon and fork stable enough to eat. Patients rated the device’s effectiveness by using a standard tremor rating and by analyzing digital readings of the spoon’s movement. 
The tool utilizes tiny sensors that can detect movement from all angles and then respond with a quick countermovement.

Prenatal nicotine exposure shown to lead to ADHD
A new study out of Florida State University found evidence that a prenatal exposure to nicotine could affect multiple future generations. The researchers, professors Pradeep G. Bhide and Jinmin Zhu, suggest that nicotine exposure can cause epigenetic changes — changes that affect parts of one’s DNA, such as turning on or off certain regions. Prior studies suggested that smoking during pregnancy led to a 40 percent increase likelihood of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) cases.
To see if something was happening at the genetic level, Bhide and Zhu exposed pregnant mice to nicotine. In their multigenerational study, they found that changes occurring in the grandparent’s genes were being passed on to offspring. However, many future studies are needed before any sort of causality between the two is determined.

Mysterious polio-like illness found in five children
At least five children in California have been suffering from a virus that causes polio-like symptoms, including limb paralysis and problems with breathing. In all of these cases, the children did not respond to treatments and their paralysis appears to be permanent. The children do not have polio, since they were all vaccinated against it. Doctors believe that the cause of the symptoms may be enterovirus-68, which was first detected in California over 50 years ago. Enterovirus-68 has been confirmed in two of the cases. Other viruses which are known to have paralysis as a symptom are West Nile, echoviruses, and adenoviruses.
Researchers say that the problem is not endemic and parents should be aware, but not alarmed.

Older paternal age  linked to likelihood of ADHD in kids
A recent study published in JAMA Psychiatry has shown that children born to fathers over the age of 45 are three times more likely to develop autism and 13 times more likely to have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) than children born to fathers 20–24 years of age. The researchers looked at millions of parent-child relationships in Sweden between 1973 and 2001. They focused specifically on relationships with siblings; using related individuals takes out environmental factors. Previous studies also linked older fathers with increases in substance abuse and schizophrenia among their children.

“A lot of times when I do shows .... I intend to meet you where you’re at and bring you to new heights. Meet you where you’re low and connect with you there, and then bring you up by the end of the show. And that’s kind of my philosophy with music now, kind of really hitting at the struggles of life and the human experience, and making it more bearable .... making struggles laughable, almost,” Kai Roberts said with a confident air as he leaned back in his chair.
Roberts, a senior business administration major with a concentration in marketing, released his debut album, Carnegie Café last November. The album explores the various pressures exerted on college students, most notably the extreme stress that a lot of Carnegie Mellon students endure. 
However, Roberts pointed out that there is a difference between stress and mental health, as stress is a very immediate feeling, “an activator of emotional distress,” whereas anxiety and depression are more deeply rooted in worrying about the future and dealing with the past. According to Roberts, “anxiety and worrying about the future by way of the past was the driver in Carnegie Café.”
“I was just dealing with anxiety issues; they started in fall 2012,” Roberts said, speaking about the inspirations that germinated the album. “I took [a semester] off so I could clear my head, so I could refocus myself and kind of vent. Carnegie Café was really that venting process .... After a while, it turned into a higher purpose. I really want to enlighten people on the ideas of mental health, and how to deal with stuff in college, and how to, essentially, face yourself.”
An album that helps people face themselves is a tall order, but Roberts has experience using music as a tool for dealing with the world and interacting with others. In high school, he was a member of Arts Greenhouse, a hip-hop education program that inspires local teens through music. In college, Roberts continued to work with the program as a mentor. However, Roberts’s love for hip-hop began long before high school.
“The first hip-hop album I remember listening to was Snoop Dog’s Doggy Style album. I was like three, but my dad would put it on, and we’d just dance,” Roberts said. 
“It was just fun, and I feel like that launched my interest in music. A little bit older, my dad started DJing, pretty much old school parties, but some younger stuff. There was this monthly CD that used to come in the mail — I’m not even sure if they still have it — so he would order these just to stay up on the new music. And me and my brother, we just loved when this CD came. We would wait for this CD every month, and every time it would come, we’d plug it in and listen to the new music.”
In fact, it was one of these early CDs that prompted Roberts’ very first verse. “One CD came in — I don’t know if you remember Lil’ Romeo — I was jealous of Lil’ Romeo,” Roberts said. “It was like fourth grade.... All the girls were talking about him, going ‘aww, Lil’ Romeo!’ I was like ‘I can do that!’ So I got mad, and I went downstairs and wrote my first verse. And it wasn’t as good as Lil’ Romeo’s, but it was my first verse. That was the first actual hip-hop verse I remember writing .... I was trying to be better than Lil’ Romeo.”
In middle school, Roberts developed an interest in producing music, and then joined Art Greenhouse in high school, which helped him further develop those skills. 
After forming a band called H&T (short for Heroes & Terrorists) with a group of friends, Roberts began to write his own verses. In his first year of college, he began performing with another band he formed with Carnegie Mellon students. “I really see myself as a mix of all three — writer, producer, performer .... I love every aspect of it,” Roberts said.
However, Carnegie Café was not just a debut album for Roberts, but a way to explore those interconnected passions. He said “I feel it’s not really an album, it’s an initiative, and I have to complement it with other ways .... other mediums for the message to get out there.”
One medium Roberts is exploring is called “_Carnegie Café_ Conversations,” in which Roberts goes to various freshmen dorms around campus to facilitate conversations and promote awareness of stress and mental health disorders. “If I had known what a mental health disorder looked like, it would have prevented a lot of struggle that I went through in healing myself,” Roberts said. 
Roberts is also working on a Kickstarter to make Carnegie Café into a visual album — like a short film — in which he hopes to work with other Carnegie Mellon students. Roberts wants to make Carnegie Café a communal experience, in which people of all different passions can participate.
As to why Roberts feels that Carnegie Café should be more than just an album? “I hate the idea of making an album seem like a selfish endeavor,” Roberts said. “I really want to make this a community endeavor. This is for our community. This is Carnegie Mellon’s album. That’s why I named it Carnegie Café. It was really representative of a lot of our struggles. I just want to get people involved.”
Roberts has an upcoming show on March 19 starting at 8:15, at the University of Pittsburgh’s William Pitt Union, Northeast Palace. He was invited by Active Minds, a mental health awareness club on Pitt’s campus, and will lead a short discussion after the show. Carnegie Café is also available for free in the University Bookstore.

Last week, the School of Drama presented a production of Annie Baker’s The Aliens — which takes its title from the Charles Bukowski poem of the same name — in the John Wells Video Studio in the Purnell Center for the Arts. The play revolves around three young men who share loneliness and dissatisfaction with their stagnant lives in the lot behind a teashop.
What drives The Aliens isn’t necessarily plot, but instead the relationship formed between the shy and fearful Evan, played by junior acting major Luke LaMontagne, and the two trapped free spirits who hang around in the lot behind the teashop where he works: Jasper, played by junior acting major Brady Dowad, and KJ, played by junior musical theatre major Jean Floradin.
Evan, a boy approaching the end of high school and, thus, about to forge his own life, stands in stark contrast to Jasper and KJ, who have both found their lives falling short of their ambitions. KJ is a former mathematics and philosophy major with a penchant for psychedelic mushrooms who dropped out of school after suffering a nervous breakdown, the effects of which still linger in his erratic mind. Jasper is a former trailer-trash orphan turned talented aspiring novelist who idolizes Charles Bukowski, but is haunted by his past and lacks the motivation to push his life forward. The friendship the three forge is incredibly real and beautiful, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when things come crashing down.
The show’s acting, a vital ingredient in such a character-driven show, was phenomenal. Dowad tapped into something within him to bring out the pain in Jasper’s tortured character, but knew when to bring forth the hopeful energy that marked Jasper’s more effective moments. KJ, a difficult character who is all over the map emotionally and mentally, was well controlled by Floradin. In KJ’s moments of psychosis, especially, Floradin made the room feel as if it had shrunk by a factor of a million. 
The show belonged to LaMontagne, though, who not only navigated his way through both the sudden shifts between heavy drama and comedy, but perfectly exhibited the change in Evan’s character from a meek boy allowing himself to be controlled by his surroundings to a man determined to live life on his own terms. The show’s final scene, involving Evan sloppily playing the folk tune “The Hammer Song,” was especially powerful in the defiance of it.
What helped make The Aliens such a memorable experience was the immediacy of it. The John Wells Video Studio is an incredibly small space, and the furthest any audience member could be from the performing space was perhaps a yard. This closeness removed any sense of detachment from the action and allowed you to feel as if you were sitting in the lot right with the characters. The show was so intimate that one could even hear the pant legs of the actors gently rubbing against each other.
Director Cameron Margeson took advantage of the play’s less-is-more approach with great success, often allowing a simple silence to linger just enough to let it speak volumes. The close quarters of the studio certainly helped in this achievement. Junior acting major Jeremy Hois praised the show’s “beautiful use of silence, which often added more to the words than what was simply written.”
The set was simple, but said a lot about the space that the characters inhabited. A tire full of cigarette butts demonstrated the history of the lot and Jasper and KJ’s place in it. The barbed wire that topped the fence that ran around the perimeter of the room either kept intruders out or, perhaps, kept Jasper and KJ trapped inside. Gentle, fingerpicked guitar melodies hovered over the few scene changes, adding to the show’s poignancy.
All in all, The Aliens was a great experience. It may not have had the same advantages of the main stage productions in the Chosky Theater — namely a big budget for elaborate sets and costumes — but that was more of a strength than a weakness. The show was what good theatre is supposed to be: powerful words spoken by talented actors that leave the audience slightly different people than they were when the show began. To put it simply: It was beautiful.

Warning: This article contains spoilers for The Americans season 2 premiere, “Comrades.”
What’s harder than being the parents of a teenager? Being the parents of a teenager while also working undercover as a spy for the KGB. That’s what Elizabeth Jennings (Keri Russell) and Philip Jennings (Matthew Rhys) learned in the season two premiere of FX’s The Americans last Wednesday.
When we last left the Jennings, Elizabeth was just beginning to recover from a severe gunshot wound and had taken the first step toward repairing her increasingly real marriage to Philip. Meanwhile, their daughter Paige (Holly Taylor) had begun to snoop around the laundry room where her parents conduct their secret activities.
Largely focusing on Elizabeth’s return after two months of recovery (although her cover story was that she was helping a very sick aunt), the episode developed slowly before finally culminating in one large game-changing event.
On the other side of the Cold War, the Jennings’ neighbor and FBI Agent Stan Beeman (Noah Emmerich) wasn’t having quite the same luck in his marriage. Viewers found him still separated, but relatively happy with his mistress/informant Nina Sergeevna (Annet Mahendru).
On the whole, the episode did what most premieres should: gave the viewer a nice little catch-up about what’s going on. That being said, the Jennings family trip to the carnival, which quickly morphed into a dead-drop assignment, really served to push the season in a new direction.
The focus on the Jennings as a family in this episode, as well as the twist at the end, suggest that this season will tackle more of the practical aspects of their life. Elizabeth and Philip began to deal with the idea that their children are just as involved as they themselves are, even if they make serious efforts to keep them out.
Although distinctly more upbeat than previous episodes, the premiere contained that nagging sense of history that pulls you out of the story, even as the writing and acting brings you in. Viewers root for Elizabeth and Philip, even knowing about the cause they serve and the eventual conclusion to the Cold War.
As the Jennings enjoyed a day at the carnival, you might have forgotten the real reason they were there: to complete an assignment. The contrast between the overly joyful aura at a carnival and the brutal murder scene that came at the end served to jerk the viewer out of their feeling of total complacence regarding the job Philip and Elizabeth do. It was a stark reminder for both the audience and the couple that their job is not for the faint of heart.
Hopefully, viewers will get to see more conflict between the two lives Elizabeth and Philip lead, instead of the fairly productive balancing act we saw last season. Paige should be an especially essential character this season, as the writers build on her suspicions and explore her development as a teenager. The groundwork for that storyline is already being laid, and it will be interesting to see where the writers take it.
Now that the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi have drawn to a close, The Americans has returned to give the American public their fix of Soviet-U. S. conflict. A premiere that alternated between dark and hopeful set the stage for this new season, which promises the same level of complex story lines, disturbingly relatable characters, and phenomenal acting that its freshman run gave us.
There’s even a Carnegie Mellon shout-out — a fellow English-speaking Soviet spy couple whom the Jennings work with has a Carnegie Mellon-bound son. What reason is there not to watch?

A few years ago, if you asked people where they got their fashion inspiration, most would have said fashion magazines. As of late, however, many people have been replacing magazines — Vanity Fair reported an 11 percent drop in newsstand sales during 2013, according to the Alliance for Audited Media — with websites that are more easily accessible and contain the same information. These websites come in the form of fashion blogs, which are slowly taking over the fashion world. 
While many fashion bloggers who have risen to fame started out with the sole intention of sharing style tips with the rest of society, many probably had no idea that this hobby or career-enrichment project would soon grow into a career in itself, with numerous benefits and opportunities.
Consider Emily Schuman, creator of fashion and lifestyle blog Cupcakes and Cashmere. Schuman’s story begins during her sophomore year at Scripps College, when she made the decision to work in something related to publishing, advertising, and fashion. 
Two years later, upon graduation, Schuman began working at Teen Vogue and simultaneously started a fashion blog to share her interests and likes. Through advertisements and collaborations with clothing stores such as Juicy Couture, Schuman started earning money from her website and reached the point that she is at now, where the blog functions as her full-time career. She has even written a novel on the same topics as her blog, establishing her success in the industry.
Obviously not every story about fashion blogs is this successful, and Schuman’s success was also the result of a great deal of time and effort. However, it’s a fact that online blogs have become a major part of fashion. 
In addition to independent blogs like Cupcakes and Cashmere, there are also websites, like Lookbook, that allow individuals to post photos of their outfits online. Lookbook is interesting because people can not only share their outfits with each other, but they can also like — or “hype,” as it’s called on this website — and comment on others’ looks. 
The most beneficial aspect of Lookbook is the variety. Not only do visitors get to see looks from people like themselves, but they also get to see outfits from around the world. 
There are countless other fashion blogs from which one can gain fashion inspiration. For celebrity style, look at Olsens Anonymous, which features the beauty and fashion of child stars and current designers Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. 
Although it may seem like they own the blog, it’s actually curated by someone who’s simply a fan of their style. Nevertheless, the detailed descriptions place it in the top 1 percent of fashion blogs across the globe as of fall 2013, according to signature9.com.
Another cool style blog is The College Fashionista. It’s tagline is, “Your campus is the runway,” which may sound intimidating, this website is quite helpful. The looks featured on the website maintain a balance between fashion-forward and classroom suitable, which is something anyone can strive for. 
Furthermore, the website contains the option to filter by school, and guess what? Carnegie Mellon’s on there! There are also options to filter by trend or by category, so this blog is really helpful when looking to style a specific item of clothing.
With so many ideas related to fashion and lifestyle, there are hundreds upon thousands of fashion blogs that are each unique in some way. There’s even a blog about fashion blogging, called Independent Fashion Bloggers, which provides helpful tips for starting a blog. 
Whether you want to start your own blog or you’re looking for fashion advice, these blogs are sure to get you thinking. An endless number of blogs exist, and one will always lead to the next, so finding them is not an issue. You never know; you could be the next Emily Schuman.

AB Films hosted a free premiere screening of Bad Words Thursday night, though it is not set to hit theaters with limited release until March 14. If you like dark comedies with vulgar humor and one-dimensional characters, you will love this movie. For those seeking a film with substance, the movie falls flat.
The story starts with eighth-grade dropout Guy Trilby (Jason Bateman) entering and winning a spelling bee for middle school students to make up for the loss he endured in such a competition when he was a child. The action of the story starts with Guy on his way to the Golden Quill spelling bee — the be-all and end-all of spelling bees in the world. While he is there, he endures indignant comments and threats from angry parents and spelling bee officials who don’t want him to be there, even while he breaks no rules by competing.
While his antics throughout the competition are meant to provide comedy, the audience does not understand his motives or his jaded nature until halfway through the movie. At that point, he has already proven to be such a jerk, it’s hard to sympathize with him despite his sad story. In the end, when he accomplishes what he originally sets out to do, it’s so inconsequential that the audience does not feel the satisfaction or fulfillment they should after seeing a film.
One important film element that Bad Words lacked was character development. Guy was the only character that truly had any depth or experienced any real development. Even still, the little backstory that the audience got about his character — details left out for sake of avoiding spoilers — did not seem to justify his off-putting personality and disregard for anyone else’s feelings. His character was neither fully developed nor relatable.
Maybe Guy would have been tolerable if his foil — bright-eyed, innocent, 10-year-old Chaitanya Chopra (Rohan Chand) — had remained bright-eyed and innocent. Chaitanya immediately becomes lovable when he tries to befriend Guy on the way to the spelling bee, only to be rejected in a slew of colorful language and racist remarks from Guy. However, after Guy corrupts him, he experiences just a bit of character development. He doesn’t use “bad words” at the beginning of the film or show any special affinity for prostitutes, but he does both at the end.
Perhaps most disappointingly, Jenny Widgeon (Kathryn Hahn), a freelance writer hired by Guy to serve as his press sponsor in the spelling bee, gets no character development whatsoever. Her character shows definite potential for growth, yet remains static throughout the film. Jenny is nothing more than a nagging presence who serves to reveal a bit of backstory on Guy. Hahn has appeared in tons of movies (We’re the Millers, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty) and TV shows (Parks and Recreation, Girls, The Newsroom) and has proven more than capable of bringing her characters to life. This problem was not one of poor acting; but one of poor writing.
This film is not the place to look for strong female characters; there are none to be found. Any woman with half a brain is portrayed as annoying, uptight, or prudish, and only useful for sex. Jenny, for example, repeatedly tells Guy she will not have sex with him, and then immediately has sex with him. When they are not having sex — and even during those scenes — she is naggy and annoying. Dr. Bernice Deagan (Allison Janney) is an uptight prude whose only source of personal fulfillment is directing the spelling bee. These characters finish off the list of main female characters, and all other minor female characters are either prostitutes or annoying tropes that Guy insults colorfully based on their sexual activity (or lack thereof).
Characters are such an important part of a film. They can make the film relatable, draw the audience in, and make the viewers care about what happens in the story. These characters were not relatable, endearing, or well developed and are arguably the biggest shortcoming of the film.
However, comedies are not known for their hard-hitting plots or moving characters. If you’re looking for a superficial comedy with little substance, look for this movie in select theaters March 14 and nationwide March 28.

“Hello, my daddy’s a gangsta.”
With these words, spoken from his young daughter’s mouth, Schoolboy Q begins “Gangsta,” the savage opening track on his long-awaited major label debut Oxymoron, a menacing and dark album rife with violence, addiction, and moments of good and filthy fun. In addition to Schoolboy Q’s intense first-person narratives, the album boasts a wide stylistic variety of beats — including help from such industry heavyweights as Mike WiLL Made It and Pharrell Williams — and collaborators such as Raekwon, 2 Chainz, Kendrick Lamar, and Tyler, the Creator.
Oxymoron’s lyrics primarily concern Schoolboy Q’s history as an OxyContin dealer, an occupation he claims to have held in order to support his daughter — hence the album’s title plays on the contradictory nature of drug dealing to be a good father — as well as his experiences with street violence and drug addiction. While these themes are certainly nothing new in gangsta rap, Schoolboy Q imbues his raps with brash emotional honesty and a ferocity that gives them a fresh spin.
“Hoover Street” is the gangbanger origin tale we’ve been hearing since gangsta rap’s birth in the ‘90s, but delivered with the kind of menace and first-person immediacy that made The Notorious B.I.G. a legend in his own time.
“Prescription/Oxymoron” lays Schoolboy Q’s experiences with drug addiction out on the table, personifying his demons as a female lover and exposing his inner torture through sexual imagery. 
Using a tactic made popular by the original rapping dad, Eminem, Schoolboy Q’s daughter makes an appearance on the track to accentuate the collateral damage of his addiction, but her cries of “Wake up Daddy, wake up” give the song a kind of emotional bombast that hurts rather than helps.
While Oxymoron’s strengths surely lie in its moments of reflection and honesty, Schoolboy Q also knows how to have fun, and the album delivers multiple tracks that would fit well within a DJ set.
The EDM-inspired “Hell of a Night” begins with a house-style buildup before finally dropping into a trap beat for Schoolboy Q’s confident and victorious verses in which he boasts about living the high life and states that he “ain’t minding if the world stops.”
“Collard Greens,” the collaboration with Kendrick Lamar that has been blowing up rap blogs since last July, floats over a spacey and wandering beat that allows both wordsmiths to showcase their skills. Schoolboy Q bookends the song with simple, hypnotic verses, commanding himself to “smoke this, drink this, straight to my liver.” 
Kendrick, however, lights the song on fire with a multilingual verse that reinforces why he’s not only one of the most technically talented rappers around, but also possesses a stylistic flair that you just can’t take your ears off of.
Not all the album’s guests contribute as much as Kendrick, though, and one of them marks one of the album’s lowest points. “What They Want,” featuring 2 Chainz, has the kind of “cough syrup” Southern rap beat — brought to the party by Mike WiLL Made It — that Mr. Chainz has made his name on. Even on his home turf, though, his delivery stumbles like a man with two broken legs trying to climb up the stairs. Perhaps you should put some writers on your payroll instead of strippers, Mr. Chainz.
Oxymoron has been one of the most anticipated releases in hip-hop for 2014, and with good reason. Schoolboy Q’s first two studio albums, Setbacks and Habits and Contradictions, released through the independent label Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE), both made waves in the rap community. Habits and Contradictions even spawned the radio hit “Hands on the Wheel,” a song that made it onto every music hipster’s “let’s get hammered” playlist.
In addition to his own success, Schoolboy Q is a member of the Black Hippy rap collective, which counts many of the most forward-thinking artists in rap — including Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, and Kendrick Lamar — among its ranks. Kendrick’s own 2012 street narrative epic and Grammy-robbed good kid, m.A.A.d city prompted Schoolboy Q to state in an interview with 2DopeBoyz.com that Kendrick left him “no choice but to make a classic album.” 
Well, while Oxymoron may not be the classic Schoolboy Q claimed it would be, his career is just getting started, and the album’s variety of hard-hitting beats, coupled with Schoolboy Q’s always ferocious delivery, will probably give him the exposure he needs to deliver that classic further down the road. Until that day comes, Oxymoron will do just fine for driving around with the windows rolled up.

On Thursday, a sizable group assembled to join Princeton University professor of theater Stacy Wolf as she whirled through musical theatre history with her talk, “Divas, Darlings, and Dames: Women in Broadway Musicals of the 1960s.”
According to the introduction by Wendy Arons, an associate professor of dramatic literature here at Carnegie Mellon University, Wolf works at Princeton University as a member of their drama department and is also the director of the Princeton Atelier. Wolf has published two books, A Problem Like Maria: Gender and Sexuality in the American Musical, followed by Changed for Good: A Feminist History of the Broadway Musical.
The talk was largely inspired by Wolf’s second work, which focuses on examining the history of Broadway musicals through a feminist lens. By focusing on six musicals from the 1960s — Hello, Dolly!, Sweet Charity, Cabaret, Oliver!, Mame, and Man of La Mancha — Wolf was able to explain how crucial gender roles are to Broadway musicals. Wolf chose the ’60s because “musicals are always in conversation with their historical context,” and the historical context of this decade included the prevalent social change movements.
Wolf introduced the 1960s as a monumental decade of musical theatre history. The mid 1960s represented a selection of Broadway musicals which exhibit a range of styles, but all focus on a single woman and undervalue her strength in some way. There are glimpses of women holding power, but the overall messages of the musicals are confusing.
Most musicals of the 1950s and ‘60s relied on five conventions: they alternated between spoken word and singing, their storylines were easy to follow, songs were sung from a specific character’s point of view, there was aesthetic unity among the various elements of the production, and a heterosexual love story as a narrative force in the story. In the 1960s, however, a series of shows premiered that focused on the single girl cultural icon.
Portrayed in television shows, movies, and advertising, in addition to the musicals, the single girl was strong, independent, fearless, and fun. Though musicals such as Hello, Dolly!, Sweet Charity, Cabaret_, Oliver!, Mame, and Man of La Mancha possessed characters that exhibited such traits in Dolly, Charity, Sally, Nancy, Mame, and Aldonza, respectively, the musicals represented exactly what was, and still is, wrong with women’s roles in Broadway shows.
The roles, Wolf explained, are full of “contradictions between what is done and what is said, what is sung and what is danced, and what is thought and what is felt.” Wolf illustrated that paradoxically, the female character is humiliated and objectified even if the production is prominently featuring an admired actress. “These stories condemn the character while celebrating the actor,” Wolf said.
The romantic aspects of these musicals was equally confusing: While the female characters engaged with males, they end up “alone but optimistic.... The heterosexual relationship has failed, but the vibrant female body remains,” Wolf said.
In explaining the troubling trends of gender roles that were prevalent in the musicals of the 1960s and since, Wolf connected her agenda with modern day theatre. Musicals that are released on Broadway eventually filter down into high school and college settings. The messages that Broadway musicals send will eventually be the ones that young women and girls portray on public stages.
“In playing these roles, you’re 100 percent there,” Wolf said. “It should be good. You shouldn’t have to play a character that’s getting beat up and thrown around.” Wolf’s assertion is incredibly relevant and thought-provoking, especially at a school such as Carnegie Mellon with such a well-known and respected drama department that will produce the next generation of female Broadway performers.

This semester on WRCT, live music is better than ever. One of our weekly programs, WRCT: A Live Show, has been pulling in some quality local acts, from metal to bluegrass and indie.
This past Tuesday, we had Joe Materkowski, a singer/songwriter who did a killer set and answered some of our questions on air.
“I’ve listened to music my whole life.... Whenever I was a young kid, after dinner my folks would clean up, and go watch TV, but set up the record player in the back room for me, and I always kind of liked to listen to my dad’s Beatles records for an hour a night,” Joe said about his musical background after serenading the studio with his original song, “Going Home.”
Joe brought a ukulele with him, and played “Lucky Man” by Emerson, Lake & Palmer on the tiny four-stringed instrument. It was definitely the first time Emerson, Lake & Palmer has been covered like that at WRCT. Joe and our host, B­Side, talked about another project, Abacus Jones, which Joe plays in with his brother. He referred to the band as a “conceptual cover band” that plays shows at casinos, parties, and everything in between. 
Recently, Abacus Jones played for over one hundred inmates at a maximum security prison in Greene County. “It took us a long time to get all of our clearances together,” Joe said. “I was working with a few of the guards that were helping me out. It was an awesome show, though. I was kind of nervous about it, but everyone was really perceptive — guards and prisoners alike. We tried to mix up the music as much as possible.... Different people responded to different songs but there were certain songs that everybody really loved.... It was really cool, you know, I actually got to talk to a few inmates at the end and everyone was really cool.”
For more info about Joe Materkowski and Abacus Jones, check out abacusjones.com.
If you want to hear more awesome live music, tune in to WRCT: A Live Show, every Tuesday from 10–­11 p.m. at wrct.org, or at 88.3 FM.

Hey Ryan and Matt,
I’m a prospective student, and I enjoyed your latest column, so I figured I would reach out to you guys for some guidance. I’m interested in starting up an advice column for my high school’s newspaper, and I was hoping you guys could give me some direction. What is your process? How do you sort through all the requests for advice?
I’m dying to know,
Currently Unmewed of Reality, Imaginary Opportunist, Unique Sycophant
Dear CURIOUS,
Although we do this each week, Amy Dickinson of “Ask Amy” fame is probably the expert on advice columns, but let’s give this one a shot. First, many of our loyal, awkward advice seekers are normal people who live fulfilling lives ... entirely in our imaginations. Frankly, the way that we separate the wheat from the chaff has to do with what needy, fictitious character is screaming loudest. We feel obliged to get the problems these passing thoughts complain about on the page for our own sanity. We don’t care if these characters resolve their issues, so long as they leave us alone. Think about it. If we actually gave good advice, we’d be out of a job sooner than later. 
Say hello to the Easter Bunny for us!
Matt and Ryan
Dear Matt and Ryan,
Ever since I was a toddler, I’ve been watching Jeopardy! each and every weekday night. I haven’t missed a single episode in more than 15 years. I have autographed pictures of Ken Jennings, Brad Rutter, and IBM Watson hanging right next to my bed. I’m writing because whenever I bring up my Jeopardy! fandom, people give me weird looks, and tell me not to forget to get to sleep by 9:30, like I’m some old retiree.
Why are people hating on my game show?
Tangibly Reavowed; Enamored By Empty Knowledge
**Dear TREBEK, **
This is Carnegie Mellon; we have KGB, CS majors, the Quidditch team, and a Magic: the Gathering club, but Jeopardy! fandom takes the cake as the most nerdy extracurricular interest we have ever heard of.
Regardless, the sad fact is that Americans generally don’t take kindly to show-offy know-it-alls. Why do you think geeks and nerds are so ostracized in society? Or why is Carnegie Mellon where all of us congregate? Our only advice is to not let the haters hate, and let your freak flag fly.
How did IBM’s Watson autograph a picture?**
Ryan and Matt**

“Go forth and suck.”
It’s not the type of advice that Carnegie Mellon students are accustomed to hearing, but that was Alexis Ohanian’s message to attendees of his presentation in McConomy Auditorium last Tuesday evening. Ohanian, a co-founder of the popular social news website Reddit, serial entrepreneur, and Internet activist, stopped at Carnegie Mellon on his tour to promote his book Without Their Permission: How the 21st Century Will Be Made, Not Managed, which was published last October.
Like the book, his presentation outlined his personal history, such as applying to Boston startup incubator Y Combinator with his University of Virginia roommate and Reddit co-founder Steve Huffman. 
With meme-filled slides related to his experiences, Ohanian passed along advice to the sparsely populated auditorium about the importance of having the entrepreneurial mindset.
“I want them to get started building stuff and doing stuff and they don’t have to wait to graduate to do that,” Ohanian said of the students who attend his talks in a special interview with The Tartan. “Those are the things — having ideas and doing them — that’s what entrepreneurship comes down to.”
Rejection and failure were important themes of Ohanian’s talk. He told the crowd the story of his first business idea with Huffman, the idea with which they applied to Y Combinator. They called it My Mobile Menu, an SMS-based system to order food on-the-go. However, while the incubator liked the potential behind Huffman and Ohanian as a team, their initial idea for My Mobile Menu was rejected.
It was with that initial failure that Ohanian encouraged students and people within the crowd to “go forth and suck.”
“We’re all figuring things out, every one of us, and this should not stop you,” Ohanian said.
After My Mobile Menu was denied, Huffman and Ohanian went back to the drawing board, and enrolled in Y Combinator’s first class with the idea for Reddit.
“We hadn’t built anything yet, but I already had a t-shirt with our mascot on it, which I do not recommend — that is the wrong order of operations,” Ohanian said to the audience.
According to the web analytics company Alexa, Reddit is now the 64th most popular website in the world in terms of average daily visitors and page views — the 24th most popular in terms of visitors from the United States.
At each of the school visits on the book tour, Ohanian invited an alumnus from that school who started a company or similar venture to talk about his or her experience. At this talk, founder and CEO of Comprehend Systems Rick Morrison (SCS ’03) sat down with Ohanian to talk about his time at Carnegie Mellon.
Comprehend offers medical data aggregation and analysis services for various clients in the health industry. Morrison started Comprehend Systems after a string of starting companies and business ideas with varying success.
“I had a series of failed startups and failed attempts along the way,” Morrison said. “And it’s really what [Ohanian] said about taking risks and putting things out there and standing by them.”
Carnegie Mellon has made efforts recently to encourage entrepreneurship in students and faculty. 
The recently-announced Tepper Quadrangle, to be built in the current Morewood parking lot, will be home to the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship. 
The center, which was founded in 2012, was itself based on the partnership between the Donald H. Jones Center for Entrepreneurship and Project Olympus, both of which foster student entrepreneurship at Carnegie Mellon and act as incubators for new potential businesses.
Additionally, startups at the university have been supported by the Open Field Entrepreneurs Fund, a fund started by Flip Video creator and Carnegie Mellon alumnus Jonathan Kaplan (TSB ‘90), for graduating entrepreneurs that was announced at the 2011 Commencement Ceremony.
When asked about what people should take away from the talk, Ohanian said, “Not everyone is going to end up being a founder of a company, but the skill of being entrepreneurial, having ideas and going through with them — that skill is so important.”

As promised, at 11:59 p.m. Activities Board announced the artists for this year’s much-anticipated Spring Carnival Concert. Preceded by Passion Pit and Lupe Fiasco in 2012 and 2013, respectively, Icona Pop and Mac Miller will perform at the 100th anniversary Carnival on Friday, April 11 at 8 p.m.
AB revealed the artists through a Facebook event. Those previously subscribed to the AB page were invited to join the “Activities Board presents: SPRING CARNIVAL CONCERT 2014” page at the time of the announcement.  
Icona Pop is a DJ duo from Sweden, whose hit song “I Love It” brought them American attention in 2012. 
Mac Miller, a rapper and record producer who grew up in Point Breeze and now lives in Los Angeles, is most famous for “Party on Fifth Ave” from his earlier album Blue Slide Park.
Students have mixed reactions about this year's artists. 
"I only listened to Mac Miller for like a month, and I only know one song by Icona Pop. I'm not that excited," said Samantha Freedman, a junior communication design major. 
Saumya Dalal, a junior computer science major, said that this year's artists are a marked improvement over previous years. "I think it's a good choice," she said. "It's definitely better than last year's concert, or the year before."
Editor's Note: A previous version of this article stated that Mac Miller was from Mt. Oliver.

Renowned venture capitalist, entrepreneur, and Carnegie Mellon alumnus James Swartz (MSIA ’66) has made a $10 million donation to the Tepper School of Business.
According to a university press release, the donation by Swartz and his wife Susan Swartz aims to support “business education, cutting-edge research, learning technologies and interdisciplinary collaboration.” The university’s press release also included that the donation “will be used for the construction of a 295,000 square-foot facility in the Tepper Quad that will house a number of strategically interconnected entities, including the university’s Tepper School of Business, the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, the Simon Initiative and quality of life enhancements for the entire CMU community.”
Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno emailed The Tartan, “Mr. and Mrs. Swartz’s generous gift to support the new Tepper quad is a powerful statement about Carnegie Mellon’s impact on our alumni and their desire to give back to the university. Whether through the contribution of time as a mentor to students, continued financial support, or helping to shape the vision of Carnegie Mellon’s future, alumni engagement like Mr. Swartz’s is to be admired and celebrated.”
Swartz was a founding partner of Accel Partners, a firm which has aided the creation of technology companies including Dropbox, Kayak, Facebook, and Groupon.
“At Carnegie Mellon I learned to master management science, constructing business models to solve challenges that were completely new to the marketplace and unleashing the power of data for smarter business decisions,” Swartz said in a university press release, adding that “those lessons, and the skills that I developed as a result of them, have greatly benefited me throughout my entrepreneurial career. I recognize the university’s new vision for the future of business education and entrepreneurship and I am pleased to contribute toward their efforts to the benefit of new technologies and future generations of students.”
“Wow, that’s a whole lot of money that Tepper’s getting,” sophomore computer science and robotics double major Gillian Rosen said. “I’m glad that they’re giving us money. More money means more cool things that we can do.”
First-year design major Linna Griffin had a more mixed reaction. “It seems to me that there’s a lot that could go well with this money. I think it’s genuinely a great opportunity to send money to increase, not the class sizes, of course, but increase the depth and breadth of classes and increase the utilities that students can use in order to educate themselves hands-on,” she said. “I have yet to have any notice as to how exactly this money will be used and I think, coming down to the wire, it’ll really depend on how it’s used rather than the money itself being present at the university.”
University President Subra Suresh stated in his campus-wide email that Swartz is dedicated to the success of the recently announced Tepper Quadrangle on campus. Suresh described Swartz as a “longstanding adviser to, and supporter of, the Tepper School and Carnegie Mellon. He has been especially engaged as a leader and an inspiration in advancing the university’s efforts in entrepreneurship and innovation, which is a planned area of focus for the new Tepper Quad.”
Dean of the Tepper School of Business Robert M. Dammon said in the press release that Swartz “is a pioneer in the world of entrepreneurship, creating order out of chaos, allowing new technologies to develop and flourish in the marketplace. The new home for our business school will enable an expansion of entrepreneurship across the university campus and will allow us to expand the possibilities for innovative research and interdisciplinary degrees and provide a flexible technological framework that anticipates the needs of next-generation learning.”

Jared L. Cohon, who stepped down as the university’s eighth president this summer, has now accepted a new position as director of the Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation at Carnegie Mellon.
“He did great things for the university [as president],” said Rohan Saigal, a junior electrical and computer engineering major. “I have no doubt that as the new director of the Scott Institute, he will make us proud.”
For a president emeritus who has received international recognition as both a scholar and a leader, staying at the university was far from certain. 
Often, businesses or governmental organization lure past presidents to posts outside of academia.
For instance, the University’s seventh president, Robert Mehrabian, left the university to run Teledyne Technologies, Inc., and the former president of Georgia Institute of Technology, G. Wayne Clough, became the secretary of the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C.
Many students and faculty view Cohon’s decision to lead the Scott Institute as a testament to his belief in the University and the importance of energy innovation research.
“This is a big deal,” said Constantine Samaras, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering. “Having a former university president leading our energy initiative demonstrates just how serious Carnegie Mellon is about this issue.”
Cohon sees energy challenges as one of the most serious obstacles facing society. “In the future, we will have to depend less on fossil fuels — but the transition will be long and difficult,” said Cohon in an interview. “I believe that Carnegie Mellon’s strengths, particularly in the technology policy interface, will help address these challenges.”
Energy has become such an important issue that universities across the United States are investing in it. 
Stanford University began the Global Climate and Energy Project in 2002, which has funded $176 million of research. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology launched the Energy Initiative in 2006, which attracted $340 million dollars in its first five years.
When asked if Carnegie Mellon could lead in energy research given the level of financial support at peer institutions, Samaras said, “Carnegie Mellon is already a leader in analyzing the systems-level technical, economic and policy challenges surrounding energy. The Scott Institute will bring together expertise from across the university to catalyze new opportunities.”
Western Pennsylvania has a long history of energy innovation. The coke ovens around Pittsburgh were the first in America to adopt the beehive style, a technology which powered the steel boom in the 19th century. Pittsburgh’s Westinghouse Electric Corporation built the first commercial nuclear reactor in 1937 and recently, Pittsburgh has been the center of the gas boom from the Marcellus Shale Formation. 
Not surprisingly, between the University of Pittsburgh, the Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory, and Carnegie Mellon, there has been significant energy research in the Pittsburgh area. Carnegie Mellon has a history of bringing together interdisciplinary teams to solve energy problems. Perhaps the best example is Aquion Energy, a startup company that sprung from Carnegie Mellon. 
Aquion Energy is commercializing an Aqueous Hybrid Ion Battery developed by Jay Whitacre, a professor with joint appointments in engineering and public policy and materials science and engineering. These low cost, high capacity batteries might store energy cheaply enough to make unreliable renewable energy sources, like wind or solar power, more cost effective.
The Scott Institute, which will ultimately be housed in the new Scott Hall, is set to encourage more interdisciplinary projects like Aquion, and will attract new funding sources to help realize these projects. “The institute’s objective,” said M. Morgan Granger, the current director of the Scott Institute, and Lord Professor and head of engineering and public policy, “is to raise Carnegie Mellon’s already great level of activity in energy-related research and education to an even higher level.” 
Since its inception in September 2012, the Institute has raised more than $50 million for energy research. Cohon has a significant background in energy resource. He has written extensively on energy policy and has a track record of raising money for energy related research. 
Under Cohon’s leadership, Carnegie Mellon received a significant gift from Lowell and Jan Steinbrenner for the Steinbrenner Institute for Environmental Education and Research, as well as gifts from Sherman and Joyce Bowie Scott and the Richard King Mellon Foundation for the Scott Institute.

TEDxCMU held its annual conference at Carnegie Mellon University, where 11 speakers gave 10–15 minute presentations on a variety of topics. Junior decision science major Nadyli Nuñez serves as president of TEDxCMU and was in charge of this year’s conference. “TEDxCMU is an independently organized event,” Nuñez said. “TED created TEDx to make an amazing impact for people. We offer TED talks here for free, and we are into the free sharing of knowledge.”
When asked about the speakers at this year’s conference, Nuñez said, “We bring in speakers from different fields, and this year we were looking at some of the local talent.” Faculty members, students, alumni, and individuals from Pittsburgh were among those who spoke.
Nuñez is in her third year with TEDxCMU — which is itself in its sixth year at Carnegie Mellon. She began preparing for the 2014 conference in April 2013. “It’s been a journey for our team, as well, and it’s been amazing and inspiring,” she said.
Thirteen people at Carnegie Mellon, both undergraduate and graduate students, were responsible for organizing the event. According to the TEDxCMU website, these students were placed into design, logistics, finance, publicity, and speaker teams. 
Together, the different teams combined their efforts to plan and set up the event. “I’ve been lucky to be with an amazing team,” Nuñez said.
Students interested in attending were asked to register online, and tickets were given on a first-come, first-serve basis. The event’s planning required much effort, and the organizers made tweaks based on their experience from previous years. 
“We’re trying to go greener,” Nuñez explained, noting that the organizers this year decided to move away from having physical programs and, instead, embrace the digital world. They used 
eventbrite.com, a website for organizing and promoting events, for this year’s talk. The speakers were not financially incentivized to present at Carnegie Mellon, Nuñez said. “We’ve flown different people in. We raise money for that, and these speakers are doing it for free.” There were multiple rehearsals before the event took place.
Senior trombone performance major Adam M. Janssen was the Master of Ceremonies. According to Janssen, “I’m a business minor in addition to music, and one of the required courses is marketing. In that class, a few seats away from me was Nadyli Nuñez, and after the first couple weeks, she came up to me, and she wrote to me in an email a couple days later.” Nuñez invited him to audition for the position of Master of Ceremonies.
“I was of course very much flattered, and I was aware of TED talks and the TEDxCMU conference,” Janssen said. “However, I hadn’t really done much of this kind of work. But I had a recital back in February of last year, in which I was my own Master of Ceremonies, so I had a little bit of experience that was enough for them to credit my ability, so I auditioned, and a couple days later they emailed me and said they’d like for me to be the Master of Ceremonies.”
“Like the parts of a machine, everyone has their own duty,” Janssen said. “And in true teamwork fashion, we are working for a higher purpose. I found our speakers this year to be very exciting, and it was a new challenge, something I hadn’t done before. I’ve spent my life as a performer, but usually with [an] instrument in hand. I’ve never really had the opportunity to have my voice as an instrument.”
“There are eight speakers, two performers and two videos,” Janssen said of the event. “[We have] Matthew Gray, who is a stage director who prides himself in collaborations with other disciplines. We have Richard Pell, who opened a Center for PostNatural History.... We have Nina Barbuto, who founded Assemble, which is a space for creativity through different projects. We have Dan Boyarski, who was a professor in the design department here, and he’ll be talking about kinetic typography.”
Meredith Grelli, who co-founded Wigle Whiskey with her family, also spoke at TEDxCMU. Grelli’s is the first whiskey distillery in Pittsburgh since the prohibition era. Lorrie Faith Cranor, director of the Carnegie Mellon CyLab Usable Privacy and Security Laboratory, gave a TED talk about Internet security. Founder of OpenCurriculum Varun Arora also spoke. OpenCurriculum is a free online database of curated teaching materials and curricula. Scott Andrew and Nina Sarnelle performed on behalf of the Institute of New Feeling — a research clinic experimenting in news ways of feeling physically and emotionally — to demonstrate some of the techniques they use there. Mallory Wang, a junior information systems major, demonstrated her Chinese yo-yo skills. 
One of the speakers, Jane Werner, talked about sewing and its relation to her Makeshop program at the Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh, in which “children and families can design, create, and play freely using their own imaginations.” Werner has also developed Makeshop Plus, which is geared toward “older children who are still exploring their childhood passions.”
Werner said that the reason she is a children’s museum director is because she used to sew. The process of sewing, in which changes, rips, and improvisation are often employed, is similar to life, she explained. “Sewing taught me a whole bunch about materials, and [Makeshop] is teaching these kids also to see their world in a new way,” Werner said. “It gave me confidence [and] perseverance, and you can see how proud people are of their works. It’s important that we give kids and families this opportunity to work together and discover who they are.”
Dan Boyarski, professor and former head of the School of Design, talked about kinetic typography and how it facilitates communication. He compared the book culture of the past to digital culture and explained how the current digital culture has more to offer. While books are static, digital mediums are more dynamic. Digital culture, he argued, can be more effective in conveying a message than books.
The diversity of presentations appealed to students who attended. Baek Kim, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering and robotics double major, said, “I liked the presentation on kinetic typography and the first presentation, because I thought it was interesting how [Gray] connected Shakespeare to binary.”
“I just declared my robotics major, and I liked how he connected his speech to something I can relate to. I liked all of the presentations,” Kim said.

This fall, Carnegie Mellon upperclassmen will have a new option for housing: Clyde House.
Director of Housing Services Tom Cooley has confirmed the new housing location, stating that the residence will be a “Global Living Learning Community” in a renovated building located diagonally across from Shady Oak apartments at 624 Clyde St. The building will have three floors, with a possible lower level, and will house 28-34 efficiency apartments.
There will be five community spaces located in the building: one dedicated study lounge, three common areas, and one kitchen with an island-style counter in the center.
The application for living in Clyde House describes the building as “an apartment style residential community for students with a global curiosity, who are committed to deepening their own intercultural competency, and who have an interest in developing a mutual understanding of their responsibilities to be active global citizens seeking to bring change to the world they can influence.”
Apartments will house two to three people in a style similar to that of the Residence On Fifth. The building is scheduled to be fully renovated by Aug. 1, and the application to apply to live in Clyde House is separate from normal housing selection. The application is currently live at http://bit.ly/1gXqYPI.

I wish to notify the Carnegie Mellon campus community about a recent death on campus. The Miller Gallery, located in the Purnell Building, has just suffered a recent change that resulted in the loss of a critically acclaimed gallery presence on our campus. The gallery would have been celebrating its 7th year of prestige this August.
In January 2014, College of Fine Arts Dean Dan Martin eliminated the curatorial position within the gallery. Astria Suparak held this position. 
The elimination of Ms. Suparak’s position was done so that the gallery can now focus on student and faculty work rather than bringing outside shows, which are what bring the gallery national acclaim and a prestigious name.
From the most recent show, Alien She, to past shows such as Intimate Science, The Miller Gallery gained significant publicity in the art world outside of just Pittsburgh. The shows curated and brought in by Ms. Suparak resulted in large publicity for the gallery. The most recent show, Alien She, received a “Critics’ Pick!” article in ArtForum International Magazine and mentions in The Huffington Post, along with countless other publications. These publications, along with others of past exhibitions that Ms. Suparak brought into the gallery, are what gave this gallery located on a college campus a highly recognized name within the art world.
The art world will continue to remember The Miller Gallery’s presence and impact over the last six years as the gallery disappears into the Carnegie Mellon ‘bubble’ that it worked so hard to get out of.
See rip-miller-gallery.tumblr.com to view an archive of the gallery’s past prestige.

It has been a striking few weeks for LGBTQ rights both nationwide and internationally. Texas overturned its ban on same-sex marriage, Kentucky was ordered to recognize out-of-state marriages, and Arizona vetoed controversial SB 1062 — a law which would have allowed businesses to deny services to LGBTQ individuals on the basis of “religious liberty.”
Evidently, the United States LGBTQ movement has been gaining momentum. Since the Supreme Court appealed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) last June, no state has dared oppose the precedent set by United States v. Windsor. In the last three months alone, state judges in Utah, Oklahoma, and Virginia have stepped away from same-sex marriage bans and brought their respective states one step closer to full marriage equality. The attorney generals of Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Oregon have stopped defending their states’ bans, and as many as 26 states have similar cases against bans pending, according to USA Today.
It seems that Windsor pushed the tides, turning hyperspeed in favor of LGBTQ rights. Disregarding certain conservative strongholds in the South — though Texas and Kentucky were a pleasant surprise — any state bringing marriage equality to court in the current political climate would be hard-pressed both legally and socially to stem the flow of progress.
Additionally, economics has been playing an increasingly important role in bolstering LGBTQ interests. This is evidenced by the recent trend in conservative politics of proposing legislation — meant to protect religious liberty — that permits, if not encourages, discrimination against the LGBTQ community.
Economically, such legislation was bound to fail. In the days before she vetoed SB 1062, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer was barraged with messages from local businesses and major national companies alike, warning her that legalizing discrimination would be a fatal blow to the state’s economic growth, according to MSNBC. With a majority of Americans in favor of marriage equality, companies that align themselves with hateful policies risk losing a vital proportion of their consumer base. Corporate America is proclaiming support for the LGBTQ community louder than ever before simply because they cannot afford to behave otherwise.
Moreover, SB 1062 and its imitators have a weak legal standing. Even if it had passed in Arizona, the bill almost certainly would have been challenged in federal court. The Supreme Court has historically abided by the principle that any one person’s religious freedom should be protected so long as it does not infringe on the freedoms of anyone else. Religious liberty cannot legally excuse racial or gender discrimination, and the same standard should transfer naturally to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
It is true and terrible irony that conservatives have been playing the persecution card to justify infringing on the rights of LGBTQ individuals. In one illuminating interview, Anderson Cooper grilled Senator Al Melvin (R–Ariz.), who was in support of the bill. The senator theorized vaguely and warned of oncoming injustice, but — when pressed — failed to cite one concrete example of a religious person being discriminated against for exercising his or her beliefs in Arizona.
Meanwhile, LGBTQ individuals hardly have to struggle for evidence of infringement against their basic rights as American citizens. Comparing the struggles of the LGBTQ community to the supposed persecution of the religious is no comparison at all. 
In the end, SB 1062 and similar measures are nothing more than conservatives whining over having to treat everyone with decency. These laws represent an increasingly desperate effort by bigots to stand their ground on the wrong side of history.
Arizona serves as evidence that the majority will not tolerate discrimination, thereby weakening the excuses of conservatives and furthering the progress of the LGBTQ movement.

In a recent article in The New York Times, Laszlo Bock — the senior vice president of people operations at Google — elaborated on his comments from an interview last June, in which he stated that GPA, college pedigree, test scores, and brainteasers were all worthless in making hiring decisions. What was effective, Bock said, were behavioral interviews with a consistent rubric to find applicants who showed leadership, intellectual flexibility, and responsibility.
These words would seem like good news for anyone who just failed their midterms. If you meet the above qualifications, simply quit Carnegie Mellon, and apply for a job at Google!
In all seriousness though, there have been a number of negative reactions surrounding Bock’s comments. Many of those who posted comments on the article have criticized Mr. Bock’s comments as disingenuous. 
The second-highest-ranked comment is from one MetroJournalist, who states “… this is the sort of babble that all executives like to spew. It doesn’t really mean anything. How do you get a job at Google, AT&T, or anywhere else? It’s about illusion. People do not hire you for your actual abilities, but what they think you can do, based on how well you present yourself.”
As someone who has been applying for internships these past few months, I understand the MetroJournalist’s cynicism about the job market. Nonetheless, Bock’s statements represent a positive step forward that may lead to improvements in the job-searching process.
First of all, Google’s assertions are based on more than conjecture. These results have been derived from Google’s own internal study on hiring and work performance. While it’s ambiguous how Google measures work performance, it is a positive step in itself that Google is questioning whether its hiring processes are working in the first place. Too often, companies are overconfident in their own abilities; if the company makes a bad hire, it is that employee who failed to live up to company expectations, rather than flaws within the recruitment process.
Bock’s comments also serve as acknowledgment that many of the current metrics on which companies base their hiring decisions on are flawed. According to a study in the Teachers College Record, grade inflation has become so bad that “A” is now the most common grade across college campuses. As such, it is questionable whether GPA is still a good predictor of future work performance. Even worse, some companies still ask applicants for SAT scores, which is baffling since SAT scores are not even good predictors of first year college performance, as ABC News reports.
Some may argue that Bock’s comments cannot be applied to companies in general, since job candidates for Google are top talent, and at that tier, metrics like GPA matter less. 
However, this factor should not change the fact that companies should be testing their recruitment processes to make sure that they are effective, and that companies should continually work to find more accurate ways to determine a candidate’s ability. Hopefully, more companies will follow Google’s footsteps in this regard. Companies should be just as intelligent and innovative as the candidates they seek to hire.

When I visited Italy last semester, I went to the beautiful island of Capri, where one can find the famed Blue Grotto. Usually, to see the grotto, one would have to pay a dude with a boat to take them inside. But because I was almost out of money, I wanted to swim inside once all the boats had left — for free. I searched the Internet to find people who had done this to make sure it was safe, and I discovered that it was perfectly hazard-free, but also illegal. One commenter, however, suggested that swimming in the Blue Grotto was not actually illegal, but instead just “Italian Illegal.”
By this post, the commenter referenced the plethora of Italian laws that outlawed something that was done all the time with no consequences, even if confronted by the police. 
For instance, when you get off the train in Naples and someone shoves an iPad in your face that may have been stolen, that’s illegal. But enough greasy-haired men offered me “special price, just for you, because you so savvy,” that I got the feeling it was done all the time.
One of the things that made the United States different from other countries at its inception was that it was governed by the rule of law, and not the rule of rulers. 
That’s why our carefully limited executive branch enforces laws, but doesn’t legislate. Then, when the executive branch messes up, it’s held in check by both elections and the judicial system.
Recently, the rule of law has eroded in this country. In response to the discriminatory laws pushed in Arizona and Kansas, attorney general Eric Holder told the attorneys general of other states that they didn’t have to defend such laws if they didn’t believe in them. 
While noble, that’s still the job of the attorney general, and ignoring that job for one law sets a very dangerous precedent. If attorneys general can ignore one law, why not any law? Additionally, President Obama’s many changes to the Affordable Care Act raise questions. The act mandates that employers with over 50 employees provide health insurance to all full-time employees starting in 2014.
Last year, Obama changed this provision so that employers don’t have to start providing coverage until 2015. Policies would start getting canceled in October 2014 — as they started getting canceled for individuals in October 2013 when the individual mandate kicked in — and small businesses would be transitioned to federal exchanges. 
Then, Obama changed the provision again so that companies didn’t have to start providing coverage until 2016, conveniently after 2014 midterm elections. Even in 2016, companies only have to cover 90 percent of their employees.
This precedent gives any future president the ability to delay the employer mandate even longer. Why not? If a Republican president gets elected in 2016, there’s ample precedent for him to delay the employer mandate indefinitely. He could even delay the individual mandate if he wanted to. In fact, he could just amend the act into oblivion via executive order.
As much as I’d love for that to happen, that’s not how the rule of law works. A new leader shouldn’t be able to change whatever laws he or she wants whenever he or she desires. While it sounds nice on the surface to just ignore discriminatory acts, or delay unpopular provisions of laws until after elections, that’s not how an effective democracy is run.
John Adams wrote about this topic extensively. As an ardent Federalist, he believed that a government with more power could use it constructively to do good for the people, but he believed in checks and balances so that this power couldn’t run amok and turn into tyranny. He called the government one “of laws, rather than a government of men.” Our government is becoming a government of men, and we’re not far from creating a class of laws that don’t make actions illegal, just, “American Illegal.”

Having an intimate conversation with your significant other over Yahoo Messenger? You might not be the only one watching.
According to a report by The Guardian, based on documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a British spy organization, engaged in a project called Optic Nerve, which collected and stored millions of still images from more than 1.8 million Yahoo users around the world in six months of 2008 alone.
Perhaps the most frightening thing about this surveillance is the manner in which these images were collected — in bulk from everyday Yahoo Messenger users every five minutes. According to the report, the GCHQ was using this information both to aid in facial recognition software and to find existing and new  terrorist suspects. Unsurprisingly, the National Security Agency (NSA) was also aiding this effort, and the scale of this project grew much larger than spying on a few “suspected terrorists.”
To make matters worse, the GCHQ even compiled a report regarding the percentage of images collected containing “undesirable nudity,” which they estimated to be between three and 11 percent. This reported percentage reveals that since 2008, the GCHQ has been an unwelcome guest in the intimate conversations of thousands, if not millions, of people worldwide.
When informed about GCHQ and the NSA’s actions, Yahoo “reacted furiously,” according to The Guardian. They accused the agencies of “a whole new level of violation of our users’ privacy,” and were clearly disgusted by such a violation.
Despite the fact that they may be morally opposed to the collection of such information, companies have no real choice in the matter, as organizations such as the NSA and GCHQ will continue to collect information from their servers until the international community becomes outraged enough. Unfortunately, as reports of Edward Snowden and the NSA begin to die down in the media, it does not look like public opinion will spur this type of action anytime soon.
With every report, it becomes more evident that spy organizations have been collecting unauthorized information from us for much longer than we have realized. Has 1984 finally arrived? Unfortunately, it appears to be here, but the international community has become so used to being devoid of privacy that no one even cares anymore.
Perhaps if the GCHQ were stealing nude images of Yahoo users ten years ago, this story would be one of the main headlines of the year. However, we have become so used to the idea of being spied on that we are indifferent about privacy, something that our founding fathers saw as so important that its protection was written as the Fourth Amendment of America’s Bill of Rights.

In light of increasing national attention to obesity, as well as the recent campus and administrative response to a “stress culture” at Carnegie Mellon, University Health Services’ day-long event “Exploring Health, Discovering Wellness” on Feb. 21 in the University Center was a timely move for students to reflect on their own well-being. There were, however, a few areas in which the event could have improved.
The American Medical Association (AMA) proclaimed obesity as a disease in August of last year, and while not all agree with the designation, it does lend credence to doctors looking to prescribe medication and to organizations looking to fundraise toward reducing obesity rates in America.
In a country stereotyped as overweight — where 27.1 percent of adults could be classified as obese — these steps are necessary. Regardless of the reasoning behind University Health Services’ event, any solid attempt at helping young adults stay healthy is worthwhile.
A positive aspect of this event was the healthy dining additions for campus locations. However, these options were only offered for the day and were not highly advertised. Why not make each of these healthy options permanent additions? The addition of these items permanently could have signified an extended campaign for campus health.
Housing and Dining Services, or even the eateries themselves, could have more actively advertised if these dishes were only going to be available only for the day of the event. While undergraduate students might not have the chance to get these dishes again, they did get to practice their healthy cooking if they attended the interactive cooking demonstrations from 11 a.m.–2 p.m. Graduate students and faculty even got their own demonstration in Schatz Dining Hall, ensuring that no member of the campus community felt left out of this event.
The welcome area on the first floor of the UC seemed to be the most accessible and attended part of the event. Passers-by could take a moment to write what health and wellness meant to them on a card and post it to a board to receive a free reusable water bottle. 
Such free items are part of a trend for the administration. They use free goods to draw people in, but often they become a crutch on which events and activities rely, similar to when a professor flourishes candy or cookies to capture students’ attentions. This was nearly the case for “Exploring Health, Discovering Wellness,” since many people just grabbed a water bottle and left. Groups planning an event should be cautious of this tendency in the future, and should try to advertise more selling points than free gifts.

On Saturday Feb. 22, Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences hosted its second annual networking event Under Construction: Building Your Future. Under Construction is a conference intended to give humanities students the opportunity to interact with successful Carnegie Mellon alumni who have degrees in subjects like ethics, history, and public policy (EHPP) or creative writing, rather than engineering or computer science.
The conference was not an internship fair, but many alumni provided helpful suggestions about job hunting and explained their personal journeys to the professions they currently have. The second Under Construction was a vast improvement upon the first. 
Last year, the conference was hosted off campus, which made it more difficult to get to and, therefore, discouraged student involvement. This year, the conference took place on the second floor of the University Center, which was much more accessible for students. Under Construction was also much better advertised this year than last, which meant that more students had the opportunity to participate. 
The conference did not merely recycle alumni from last year’s event; this year’s crop of speakers was a wide-ranging and diverse group, with many unique experiences to share with students. There was a panel on editing and publishing, another on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), as well as one on government and politics, among many others. Under Construction was an admirable effort on the part of Dietrich College to help students plan for their future careers. 
When a student studies something like computer science or engineering, a career path can be relatively easy to find — though work intensive to follow — because those skills are currently in high demand.
Career paths for humanities majors, meanwhile, can be harder to envision and plan out, and so interaction with successful alumni is an invaluable experience for humanities students. The keynote speaker, Terry Babcock-Lumish, advised students to keep an open mind and accept whatever opportunities come their way. Under Construction was an indispensable opportunity from which all Dietrich students could benefit.

Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel has recommended deep cuts in the Pentagon’s budget, citing the immense size of the defense budget as well as the shifting landscape of wartime combat.
Hagel addressed Congress, recommending the decrease of the physical size of the military to between 440,000 and 450,000 active-duty members, the smallest it would be since the military buildup immediately prior to World War II, in addition to cuts in housing allowances and other military benefits. Hagel reasoned that the United States Armed Forces must adjust to fighting smaller, more higher-tech wars, with the probability of the United States engaging in a large ground war becoming more unlikely. Additionally, Hagel mentioned the large size of U.S. budget devoted to military spending, and stated that targeted and anticipated cuts would be less damaging than a Congress sequester.
Hagel’s recommendation shows not only a well-reasoned grasp of the United States’ fiscal and military position, but also a great deal of courage. Directly after the announcement, members of Congress vowed to fight this proposal, one which Hagel appears ready to publicly defend. Additionally, with a ballooning deficit and formidable national debt, Hagel has recognized the dire state of the government’s finances. With 19 percent of the 2012 budget devoted to defense and military spending, totaling $689 billion, this area of funding must be trimmed to ensure long-term economic stability.
Hagel is a defense secretary who has offered to cut his own budget. Recognizing the national problem our country faces and offering to contribute to a solution is a praiseworthy action, and one that adjusts the U.S. military to the realities and necessities of 21st-century warfare.
