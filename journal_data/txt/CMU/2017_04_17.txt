Baseball, the sport long known as America’s pastime, is returning to the center stage of sports as basketball and hockey begin winding down. The 2017 MLB season began early this month, and as the season finds its groove, it’s time to consider some of the storylines to watch out for.
Can the Chicago Cubs win it all (again)?
The Curse of the Billy Goat, named after a tavern whose owner was forced to leave Wrigley Field due to the odor of his goat during Game 4 of the 1945 World Series, has been a thorn in the side of Cubs fans for decades.
In 2016, the Chicago Cubs finally broke the curse, winning their first World Series in 108 years. Coming back from being down 1–3, they played a thrilling Game 7 in 10 innings that will be remembered for a long time. But what about 2017? It’s a good possibility that the Cubs will make the playoffs and get the chance at a run for another championship.
Most of their key players, including Anthony Rizzo, Kris Bryant, and Ben Zobrist will be back, while the team as a whole is quite young. The absence of serious, tough competition in the National League Central division also helps the team’s chances. The Cubs have begun the season slowly, but the season is just getting warmed up.
Bryce Harper, MVP 2.0?
In 2015, Washington Nationals right fielder Bryce Harper made good on his Rookie of the Year award from three years prior to win the National League Most Valuable Player at 23, the youngest to do so by unanimous decision.
Harper had an absolutely mind-boggling year, with 118 runs, 42 homers, and a .460 on base percentage. The statistics kept going: .649 slugging, 198 OPS+, and 124 walks.
Harper’s 2016 season was not bad by any means, but simply looked subpar when compared to his monster season the year before (and the high possibility he was dealing with injuries).
Now at 24, can Harper return to his 2015 form and lead the Nationals in challenging the Cubs?
Who is a contender?
Like all sports leagues, MLB is dominated by a few perennially good teams, along with a couple up-and-comers. The Cubs are a team built to last. Who is up there with them?
The Boston Red Sox has a young group in their stout offense, and their bullpen is complete with Craig Kimbrel. Others include the Cleveland Indians, the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Nationals, and the New York Mets. Don’t count out the young New York Yankees and the Pittsburgh Pirates, who are looking to bounce back after a down year in 2016. All that’s certain is that there will be a surprise.

The 12th-ranked Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team won its third straight match when it topped 15th-ranked University Athletic Association (UAA) rival Johns Hopkins University, 7–2, on Sunday, April 9 at home. The Tartans improved to 14–6 for the season while the Blue Jays fell to 9–4.
The pair of first-years Vinaya Rao and Courtney Ollis put the Tartans ahead 1–0 with an 8–2 victory at second doubles.
After senior Nicholle Torres and junior Cori Sidell fell 8–6 at first doubles, sophomore Jamie Vizelman and junior Katie Lai pulled out a 9–7 win at third doubles.
Vizelman was first to finish singles play when she won 6–1, 6–1 at third singles. Rao gave the Tartans a 4–2 lead with a 6–1, 6–2 victory at fourth singles before Lai earned match point at sixth singles with a 6–4, 6–4 win.
Also earning victories for the Tartans was Sidell at second singles, 6–3, 6–2, and Torres at first singles, 6–2, 3–6, 6–3.

Carnival, the time when Carnegie Mellon students take part in the quirky traditions of constructing themed booths, racing their self-constructed buggies, and showing off their mobile robots in the Mobot Races, is almost upon us. While most of campus either partakes in these weirdly fun pastimes, works on semester projects of various degrees of completion, or takes the opportunity to have a good night’s sleep, senior hurdler and jumper Rebecca Fortner will instead travel with the women’s track and field team to the 2017 University Athletic Association (UAA) Outdoor Championships, hosted this year by the University of Chicago.
The passion that the chemical and biomedical engineering double major has for her craft is evident from her focus on the competition. “I wouldn’t miss it for the world,” Fortner said when asked about going to the championships while much of the rest of campus is partaking in Carnival.
Her commitment to the team is her biggest enjoyment, stemming from a life invested in sports. “My family is very athletic. My dad was a football coach, played football, and ran track. My mom was also into basketball. My sister was into cheerleading and gymnastics.” With a family like that, it’s no wonder that Fortner got involved in athletics early and often. “I got into a lot of things from gymnastics to cheerleading, basketball to track.”
It was during high school that Fortner realized which sport she wanted to focus her full effort on. “After I hit my growth spurt, I made a state championship in track and got serious with it.” Her results in the sport gave her the confidence to plan on continuing the sport in college. “I thought I would be able to compete in college.”
It was the combination of the academic and athletic programs that attracted Fortner to Carnegie Mellon. “Track was a big part of why I chose here, but the opportunity to double major was really huge too. Graduating from here will be a pretty big deal. My family is all from smaller schools and colleges, so being able to graduate from somewhere like Carnegie Mellon is such a huge deal.”
It certainly isn’t easy with a schedule that starts punching the moment the spring semester starts. “Spring semester, our first track meet is the first week we come back, and we go throughout the whole semester. You have to make sure you get as much sleep as you can, eat healthy, etc.” Time with the team, of course, is not always just about track and field. “Friday nights we all get together and watch a movie or something so we’re not too tired on Saturday.” When it comes time to compete, it’s all about following the fundamentals and supporting one another. “We all have our separate routines. High jumpers will measure steps, practice together. We all help each other during the meet.”
Fortner doesn’t take any of her opportunities for granted. “I feel like just being able to compete at a college level is pretty significant.” Her hard-working mentality has steeled her and helped her earn second place in the high jump at the 2013–14 UAA Indoor Championships and the 2015–16 UAA Indoor Championships. “That was really awesome.”
Looking ahead, Fortner is eager to get working for a good cause, leveraging her knowledge and dedication toward helping as many people as she can. “I want to go into pharmaceuticals, anything to help people.”

Americans currently prefer to drive, take the bus, or ride the train for regional journeys (i.e. journeys within state, or less than 1,000 miles). Planes aren’t that popular of an option, because getting on them is much more cumbersome than getting in a car. After all, why would anyone go through the hassle of airport security and ticket prices just to travel from Boston to New York?
A startup called Zunum Aero wants to make the plane the go-to option. With tickets as cheap as $25 and extremely quick boarding times, thanks to limited security screen- ing, Zunum’s  ights will be as convenient as taking a bus. The Zunum Aero team is made of pilots, Ph.D. holders, and  ight scientists. Its CEO, Ashish Kumar, was inspired by the disruptive nature of electric aircraft, and hopes his startup will inspire others.
Zunum’s business plan includes such cheap tickets thanks to one thing: hybrid planes. These are planes that run their engines on electricity, or fuel if batteries do not have enough charge. These planes offer much cheaper tickets than conventional airlines because ticket pricing is not as dependent on  uctuating fuel prices.
There isn’t much else beyond regional  ights Zunum Aero can offer at the moment. With hybrid planes, range is greatly limited by battery technology, because batteries can only hold so much charge today. The technology is gradually improving, though. The startup will initially offer 700 mile journeys. As better batteries are produced with time, Zunum will begin to consider journeys of up to 1,000 miles. Improved battery technology will help make Zunum Aero’s planes fully electric someday. For now, its planes rely partially on fuel to complete their journeys.
Zunum Aero will have tough competition in the future. Many startups are tackling the challenge of faster regional commutes. Hyperloop, for example, will shorten travel time between San Francisco and Los Angeles
to 20 minutes once it’s up and running. Zunum Aero’s amazing $25 offer may be what wins the competition, however.
In an era of climate change, many companies are searching for alternative plane technology to counter the fuel jet engine. Currently, short  ights produce up to 40 percent of aviation emissions in the United States. The ozone layer has weakened drastically over the decades, and this may be partially due to the commercial airline industry. Zunum Aero’s planes will have zero emissions while running on electricity. Air pollution isn’t the only type of pollution Zunum Aero is taking on. Its planes will be incredibly quiet, reducing noise pollution over suburban areas.
Solar Impulse 2 is a plane that made history in 2016 by  ying around the world, powered only by solar panels. Although Solar Impulse 2 soars at a mere 140 kilome- ters per hour, its achievement signals that the future of clean air travel is budding. As solar panels become more ef cient, solar planes could begin to compete commercially with fuel jet airliners.
If there’s one thing the airline industry demonstrates time and time again, it’s that a business plan is as important as the technology itself. For example, the cutting-edge technology that was the supersonic Concorde couldn’t survive because it didn’t make enough pro t and was costly to service. If Zunum Aero’s cheap ticket prices are enough to service planes, replace worn out batteries, and pay staff, then it has a strong future. Large companies such as Boeing and Jet Blue certainly think Zunum Aero has a future and a lot of promise. That’s why those two companies have established themselves as the startup’s partners.

The Cassini probe has spent the last 13 years orbiting Saturn at a distance, faithfully gathering data and sending it back to Earth. Now, it is entering the  nal stage of its mission, named the Grand Finale, and will eventually plunge into the planet itself.
NASA describes the Cassini mission as “one of the most ambitious efforts in planetary space exploration.” Launched in 1997, Cassini revealed the landscapes of Saturn’s moons: geysers on Enceladus, lakes of methane on Titan, an oxygen atmosphere on Rhea.
It also discovered multiple new moons. Cassini photographed and collected data from Saturn’s atmosphere and composition. It observed rare weather phenomena, like two storms merging and another storm wrapping its way around the planet end-to- end. The probe also examined Saturn’s rings in a level of detail never before possible.
Much of what we know about Saturn, and almost all we know about its moons, comes from the Cassini mission and its cargo, the Huygens probe; nonetheless, even after two decades in space, Cassini still has more to learn in its last months.
Cassini, on its 127th and  nal trip past Saturn’s moon Titan, will use the moon’s gravity to swing into a tighter orbit around Saturn. This closer orbit will place Cassini between Saturn and its rings, a space that has never been studied before. From this new perspective, Cassini will help scientists learn more about Saturn’ gravity and magnetic  eld, as well as clear up some persistent mysteries like how fast the planet rotates. It will also take the clearest photographs yet of the innermost moons.
Cassini will also explore Saturn’s rings and attempt to determine their age, mass, and composition.
Like the previous stages of Cassini’s journey, this  nal expedition promises rich new data. “It will be like a whole new mission,” according to Linda Spilker, Cassini’s project scientist at JPL.
After 22 close orbits over the next  five months, Cassini will have exhausted its fuel. On Sept. 15, one month short of twenty years of service, it will hurtle directly into Saturn’s atmosphere. It will collect and transmit atmospheric data until it is crushed and ultimately disintegrated by Saturn’s gravity. Planetary scientist Sarah Horst assures us that “even in its  nal moments, Cassini will be doing groundbreaking science.” Cassini will discover how the rings’ material is distributed, and how they may have formed. These revelations will in turn inform scientists about the evolution of planets in our solar system. Cassini has been one of the most succesful exploration and data collection missions.

Members of Carnegie Mellon Student Pugwash attended the Student Pugwash Conference 2017 at Purdue University. The conference focused on space exploration and policy, ranging from topics like “Repeat Mars Missions” to the “Future of International Space Exploration”. Each of these talks had interesting angles on how the world could approach space exploration. This article focuses on the talk on international progress on space ight given by Dr. Daniel Dumbacher.
Dumbacher framed the entire presentation in the form of the past, present, and future. For the past, he focused on the progress of the United States in space exploration, starting with the last lunar mission and ending with the closing of the space shuttle program. He also noted that, at the moment, space exploration has ventured to every planet in the solar system. Dumbacher drew parallels between space exploration and the Lewis and
Clark expeditions, suggesting that expeditions in unknown territory result in the eventual expansion.
He moved on to the current state of space exploration. At the moment, the International Space Station (ISS) remains one of the few international projects still in operation. There are also robotic exploration missions on Mars. Currently, the biggest movement in space exploration is commercial space ight. Companies are driving new and innovative technologies like reusable spacecraft.
The current plan for space exploration follows  ve phases. Phase zero, the current phase, focuses on continued experimentation on the challenges of space-  ight on the International Space Station. Phase one will include missions in cislunar space with emphasis on deep space transportation. After this, we must face phase two’s emphasis on deep space transport, which includes continued missions to the moon. Phase three will start testing the viability of manned Mars missions. From there, in two more phases, humanity could potentially accomplish the goal of manned missions to Mars.
First, we must tackle the question, “How can this all be done?” The solution to this would be a focus on a space- centered economy. Such focus would spur the development of technologies that bene t terrestrial and space society. At the moment, one example of a block to such international cooperation is the status of China in space. China was blocked from access to the ISS, so it produced its own space program and station.
Another issue is time. Dumbacher suggested that space exploration may follow the rise of commercial aircraft. Aircraft arose through many years of development and growth, with gradual growth in adoption. Similar development processes occurred with the prevalence of computers and cell phones. Dumbacher suggested that, although space exploration and travel is pricey, with time it may become some- thing attainable to the public. Maybe, even space tourism could be on the table.

Breakthrough made in Zika detection
Scientists recently developed SHERLOCK, a new and more robust diagnostic system. SHERLOCK, a variation of CRISPR, is better at detecting diseases and distinguishing the Zika virus from its close variant Dengue.
Until now, CRISPR has been used to edit genomes. Scientists noticed its potential to detect viruses, but this functionality was not exploited until now. SHERLOCK is one million times better than the current means of Zika detection, ELISA, which searches for specific proteins. SHERLOCK works with RNA, which is found in a virus’ cell nuclei.
Overall, SHERLOCK means faster and more accurate detection of the Zika virus. The scientists who designed it are planning to commercialize it, making it widely available. They are even thinking of launching a startup around their newfound product; how- ever, before any of this can happen, SHERLOCK will have to be approved for use.

New leak exposes NSA hacking tools
In what seems like an episode of Mr. Robot, a hack- ing group TheShadowBrokers somehow obtained and released sensitive National Surveillance Agency (NSA) tools on hacking Windows computers and  nancial net- works. The tool includes security breaches for older versions of Windows and the SWIFT banking network used for transferring money internationally.
The  les are still available online on GitHub. Microsoft quickly released a patch to eliminate the vulnerability the hack revealed. A patch doesn’t solve the problem entirely, since users who do not install it are still at risk.
TheShadowBrokers group emerged in August last year. It’s unknown who the hackers are, but rumors link them to Russia. Their hacks are accompanied by purposefully broken English with vague messages; one such message reads, “Is being too bad nobody deciding to be paying theshadowbrokers.”

Oceans found on gas giants’ moons
NASA recently announced that Jupiter’s moon Europa and Saturn’s moon Enceladus may be the best bets for life outside of Earth in our solar system. The announcement was made at NASA’s head- quarters in Washington D.C.
The Cassini probe analyzed the composition of water plumes rising out of Enceladus’ surface cracks. 
Large amounts of hydrogen were found, suggesting that oceans of liquid water lie beneath the icy surface. “Now Enceladus is high on the list in the solar system for show- ing habitable conditions,” said Hunter Waite, leader of the Cassini Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer team at the Southwest Research Institute.
Plumes composed of salty water were found on Europa’s surface, albeit not as ubiquitous as is the case on Enceladus. The data Cassini sent back suggests that a pocket of warm water lies beneath the surface at the location of the plumes, ripe conditions for life.

There were 22 students in Carnegie Mellon University’s BXA Intercollege Degree Programs (BXA) that performed and showcased their creations and exhibits to the public in the College of Fine Arts building Wednesday, April 12 as part of the BXA Student Showcase. 
The event was the first of its kind in the history of BXA. Traditionally, BXA students students share their inventive projects that synthesize diciplines from all across campus in an annual event called Kaleidoscope. Instead, this year Amanda Branson, a senior pursuing a Bachelor of Humanities and Arts in decision science and music performance, hosted the BXA Student Showcase as part of her senior capstone.
The BXA Student Showcase is part of Branson’s senior capstone project, a required project of BXA seniors where students create work that reflects their curricula and learning over their college career.
“You can see, through the eyes of the artists, what’s important to them with the exhibits,” Branson said. “I hope that the Student Showcase helps empower others to succeed through seeing the works of others.” Branson also participated in the showcase, giving a commencement speech and performance.
Six other students held performances in the Kresge Theatre. 
The performances ranged from the delightful and quirky, such as junior Bachelor of Science and Arts in chemistry and music performance student Valerie Senavsky’s Who Needs a Cello to Play the Cello Song, to the emotive, such as Bachelor of Humanities and Arts in technical writing and music technology junior Joshua Brown’s dance performance Voodoo Bag. 
Dante Horvath, a senior pursuing a Bachelor of Humanities and Arts in linguistics and music performance, performed four Hungarian folk songs by Zoltan Kodaly. This performance was a great example of the essence of showcase and the BXA Intercollege Degree Programs as a whole, with Horvath synthesizing his two interests into one cohesive work. Horvath’s family’s Hungarian heritage was channeled throughout the four pieces, and not only showcased Horvath’s work during his time at Carnegie Mellon but his personality as well. All of the performances were recorded and are available for viewing on the event’s Facebook page, BXA Student Showcase.
Across the hall in the Alumni Concert Hall were 15 visual exhibits, including a diverse range of media from computer programs to sculptures and paintings. Complete with a reception, the Showcase structured the Alumni Concert Hall so attendees could walk around the exhibits at their own leisure and fully embrace the artwork of the students involved.
Seniors pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science and the Arts John Choi’s “Hugging Robot” and Luca Damasco’s Wick editor were two of the computer programs featured at the exhibit. Choi’s “Hugging Robot”, inspired to be his own “robot butler,” gave surprisingly good hugs and could even move on its own. An Xbox controller was also wired to the robot to make it easier to control. Damasco’s Wick editor is a multimedia creation tool that helps create websites that would require a lot of coding in mere seconds, and showcased various programs made with Wick throughout the exhibit. In classic Carnegie Mellon BXA fashion, these exhibits challenged and blurred the distinction between innovation and art. 
A junior pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science and Arts in computer science and music technology, Sara Adkins also used technology as a springboard for her art, but her project showed the other side of what technology and art can do. Her “RobOrchestra”, a series of robotic arms playing musical instruments, could be heard throughout the hall. The robot’s music, which was light-hearted and fun, matched the playful nature of the project and brought smiles to a lot of faces.
A junior pursuing a Bachelor of Business and Arts in global systems and management and art, Grace Wong featured her photo book entitled “Numbness: Rituals for Self-Preservation,” a striking collection that not only revealed aspects of her own personality but also encouraged visitors to examine their own. 
Sophomore pursuing a Bachelor of Humanities and Arts in decision science and art, Daniel See not only showcased his project, but also put it for sale. See featured cups made by those affected by homelessness in Pittsburgh, selling each cup for $20 and using his project and the Showcase as a greater outlet for activism and awareness. His project was also featured in an art show on homelessness in Pittsburgh earlier this year.
Junior pursuing a Bachelor of Humanities and Arts in anthropology and art, Madeline Quasebarth’s “Meatsacks,” a collection of five photos of different body parts, was intricate and striking, standing out against its display. Senior Joni Sullivan, who is pursuing a Bachelor in Humanities and Arts in psychology and art, had two pieces, “Welcome Home” and “Pool Party,” which were bright and colorful, bringing a fun vibe to the Student Showcase.
The BXA Student Showcase succeeded in bringing together the Carnegie Mellon community through the artwork of others and helping departing BXA seniors celebrate their successes, and it has all the promises of becoming a new annual tradition for the BXA programs.

The previous writers of this section were somewhat unavailable this weekend, so I, very excitedly I might add, took on the mantle of being your bar buddy this week. After getting a "hell no" to my idea of reviewing William Penn Tavern, I went out to grab a drink with a couple of friends in Lawrenceville, at an Izakaya (Japanese Pub) called Umami. 
The Location: Umami is located off Butler Street surrounded by many other bars and attractions and the area is happening but not too loud. I don’t think there are any good ways to get there by bus — your best bet is to drive or uber there. 
The Drinks: The best word to describe the drinks at Umami would be "interesting." The drinks all reconcile with the theme of the restaurant — that of celebrating Umami (savory) flavors — and have names such as "#GodzillaTears" and "Panda Panda Panda". 
I had a drink that was off their regular menu and was primarily a combination of Suntori Whiskey and Yuzu. I wouldn’t normally put whiskey and yuzu together but I enjoyed a break from the normal, and delighted in having the opportunity to savor a novel drink. My friends tried the Tickle ‘n Giggle, which consisted of Pop Rocks, Leblon cachaça, basil, coconut lemongrass nigori, and lime. They didn’t enjoy the drink much, which they said tasted like everything and nothing, but had a lot of fun eating the pop rocks that came with it. 
The drinks were all between $9 and $12, so not terribly expensive. You probably don’t want to go here to have a regular cocktail but if you’re in the mood for trying something new, this is definitely the place. 
The vibe: Umami has the vibe of a modern Japanese restaurant — it supposedly also has amazing sushi, which being a vegetarian I can’t comment on. It’s dimly lit with red lights thrown in certain places giving it a very dark anime kind of vibe. Once you enter, you have to climb up two flights of stairs to walk up to the bar. The bar was full (possibly because it was a Friday night) but there were tables around the open kitchen, which is where my friends and I sat. The music was good but they didn’t play it too loud. The place as a whole was conducive to having a chill but meaningful conversation with a couple of your friends. 
Lit or nah: It was definitely lit, but in a very adult, "I want to sit, have a drink or two, and talk to my friends" kind of way. If you want a break from your traditional Pittsburgh bar scene, and try something new, you should definitely give Umami a shot.

I’m not one who listens to K-pop often. In fact, I don’t think I’d ever even listened to a single K-pop song before attending the Carnegie Mellon K-pop Dance Club’s (KPDC) Showcase: Checkmate event. I do, however, have a lot of friends who love the genre. It was because of my curiosity and wanting to know what all the hype was about around K-pop that I decided to go to the event. The event was KPDC's very first showcase, designed to share the dances club members had been working on all semester 
The show included performances by a variety of KPDC dance troupes, along with three guest performances featuring the dance group FRESA from the University of Pittsburgh and KASA Dance and KSA from Carnegie Mellon, all performing both song and dance covers to the music of popular K-pop artists such as BTS, GFRIEND, and Red Velvet. 
The set list featured a truly dizzying array of K-pop songs. Different Asian foods were being sold throughout the performances by other student organizations, including Carnegie Mellon's ARCC, Taiwanese Students Association, and KASA, making the entire event a fun and exciting cultural learning experience. 
What I found most fascinating were the outfits that the performers in each group wore. Before the show started, I’d seen some performers going over last minute things in the hallway, and it was amazing to see how vibrant some of their outfits were. Some wore very bright floral dresses, while others even dyed their hair purple, bright red, and rainbow. I also noticed that solid colors were a common for almost all of the outfits, making the performers pop. From bright red shirts with plain white bottoms to outfits that were completely grey, there was variety in how everyone was dressed. 
Once the performances began, the audience was able to see how all clothes from each group fit into their performance. For example, in the dance performance of “1 Step 2 Step,” by K-pop girl group Oh My Girl, the outfits worn were all bright white and blue to fit the very cute and sweet theme of the song. Comparing those outfits to those from the performance for “Boom Boom,” by K-pop boy band Seventeen, the dancers wore black bomber jackets and much darker colors for the cooler and more hardcore feel of that song. 
I was very impressed by all the dancers and singers in the show, and it was clear that everyone who participated gave their best efforts into their performances. Specifically, the dancers started at very different levels of experience, but once the groups got on stage you couldn’t even tell the difference. Almost all of the dance numbers were fast paced and seemed very complex, but the performers were all in-sync and pulled everything off. 
Overall the event was a fun time for both the performers and audience members. Although being exposed to the K-pop culture was a very new experience for me, I definitely enjoyed it, and I will try listening to more of the genre in the future.

When a friend and I decided to grab dinner and catch up, we were pressed with a serious predicament: where should we eat? The various communities around Carnegie Mellon’s campus — Oakland, Shadyside, Squirrel Hill, the Strip District — are overflowing with restaurants of all different types of cuisine, almost too many to choose from. After we narrowed down our options to Oakland, we finally decided on Spice Island Tea House, a restaurant down Atwood Street.
Spice Island Tea House is a little hole in the wall, a short walk down Atwood. We almost passed it without realizing. The restaurant has a rustic, homey feel, with succulents growing freely in the display case, wooden walls, floors, and furniture. The place is entirely decorated in earth tones. We were there in the afternoon, during the lull period between lunch and dinner, and were the only people seated, which is rather rare in Oakland.
Founded in 1995, Spice Island Tea House specializes in all things Southeast Asian, blending flavors from Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. The menu is filled with a diversity of options, including salads, fried rice, noodles, curries, specialties grilled or stir-fried, and vegetable dishes. As indicated by the name, the restaurant has an extensive loose tea list, with choices of black, green, oolong, herbal, fruity, and scented teas. It also offers an array of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.
The place is casual, and the service very quick and efficient. We immediately felt comfortable and before long, our food had arrived.
The Burmese Barbecued Chicken Thighs in yogurt-curry marinade was absolutely delicious. The chicken was very tender and juicy, and the marinade had a good balance of sweet and savory. All of the grilled and stir-fry dishes were served with steamed white rice and a side salad, which wonderfully complemented the chicken. The salad was very refreshing, and surprisingly sweet.
The Ever-Famous Pad Thai, however, left something to be desired. A good pad thai is a perfect mixture of sweetness, saltiness, sourness, and spiciness from the many different flavors. Made with stir-fried rice linguine, chicken, shrimp, bean sprout, egg, and crushed peanuts, Spice Island Tea House’s pad thai definitely had the sweetness component, but little else. While the overall taste was still good, it didn’t have the elements that make pad thai unique: the hint of spice, the pop of sweetness, the zesty lemon. The peanut taste was overwhelming, making every bite taste the same.
Since this is a tea house, we decided to try the tea of the day, Mango Indica Tea, a black tea with mango flavor. It was very good — not too sweet, not too bitter, and quite hearty.
Spice Island Tea House is wide-ranging, ensuring that there is something for everyone. It offers quality, authentic Southeast Asian food in large portions at a decent price. To top it off, it's only a short walk or trip on the bus from campus. Just steer clear of the clichéd pad thai, and you should be fine. A step above ubiquitous Chinese take-out, it’s a nice restaurant to try something new.

Dear Ruth,
IT'S FINALLY CARNIVAL. Carnival is the only thing I have to look forward to after Spring Break, so I've been patiently waiting for this moment ever since we got back. It's less than a week away now and I'm. So. Ready. Or so I thought. My professors might be out to get me, because I somehow have to execute a group project during the greatest weekend of the year! It's really not fair, but I guess we could've started sooner (but I mean we all knew that wasn't going to happen). 
I don't know what to do. There's so much I want to see and experience! The buggy races are so exciting, and I even have friends to cheer for this year! And the booth theme is great. I heard there's going to be Taco Bell booth... and I really, really love Taco Bell. I also bought a Carnegie State fanny pack to go with my outfit for the block party! If I'm stuck inside working on a group project all weekend, what do I even do with my fanny pack? Wear it in the library? And what do I do with my line-up of cute-but-confortable block party looks? Wear them to Au Bon Pain? That's ridiculous. 
Part of me just really wants to throw in the towel, forget about my group project, forgot about the inevitable doom that is finals week, and party with my friends until I forget my Numerical Methods exam ever happened. But the more responsible and less self-destructive part of me knows I should probably do my assignments. And, to make matters worse, I'll feel really bad if I let my entire group down. I don't want to be that one group member that brings the team down because I bailed last minute on the group meeting. I'd feel way too guilty to even enjoy the parties I went to. Should I just make all of them ditch the project, too? Should I convince the entire class to boycott the project? You know what they say, "He can't fail all of us, right?"
What do I do? I'm really feeling the convince the whole class to boycott the class method, but let me know what you think. Think about the fanny pack!
Sincerely,
Panicking And Really Tense #YOLO"
Dear PARTY,
You do the assignment. (Sorry not sorry! You can wear the fanny pack while you do it, if that helps.) 
For some reason, whenever a professor assigns something to be due right after Carnival, it's always worth way too much of your grade. (Is it a conspiracy...?) And I'm going to assume here that you do actually want to pass your classes, because if you don't then.... I dunno, drop out and have Carnival 24/365? But assuming you don't want that, then you're going to have to do the project. Especially because it's a group project. You don't want to be that guy that gets way too lit over Carnival and doesn't do any work on the project. (And if someone else in your group is that? See the March 27 edition of this column.)
The key is in how you schedule.
Basically everything that isn't a university organized meet-and-greet happens 5 p.m. or later. Even if you were out until 4 a.m. the night before, you can probably drag yourself up and out of bed by noon. Over four days, that's about 20 hours of "work" time available to you. Even if your group members aren't working on the same schedule as you, I presume they also want a decent grade on the project and that they'll put in the necessary time as well. (Group project tip to end all group project tips: If you don't absolutely need to meet in person, Google Drive is your new best friend. Call up whoever used to emotionally support you and tell them you're dropping them for that sweet, sweet multi-user functionality.) Basically, it's your time to become a CMU superhero — student by day, party animal by night.
It's going to maybe suck a little, and I know we all wish we had planned ahead enough that we could just sleep, Netflix, and party all of Carnival, but you're in the same boat as a lot of the rest of us. And, worst comes to worst and you have to work while midway is open, well. You can always pop out for a funnel cake to reenergize. 
You get the best of both worlds,
Ruth

In 1979, Pink Floyd put out their magnum opus, one of the most successful rock albums ever, going Platinum in the U.S. and U.K, and giving them their first number one single. A grand rock opera, its scale was matched only by its singular vision. This was The Wall, the one Pink Floyd album everyone knows and loves. Well, The Wall had a darker, messier, and less polished but equally brilliant elder sibling, Animals. The sheer size of The Wall’s shadow ensures that Animals has always remained the unappreciated genius in the Pink Floyd canon. Fans swear by it, and the rest of the world has hardly heard of it. In these strange political times, Animals makes for a remarkably prescient record.
The concept of the album is adapted from George Orwell’s Animal Farm. The only difference is that while Orwell uses the animal archetypes to reflect the death of the Tsarist autocracy and the eventual emergence of Stalinism in Russia, Pink Floyd flips the metaphor to reflect on what it believes is a ruthlessly Capitalist 1970s Britain. Hence, in Floyd’s Animals, the sheep are the poor gullible masses, the dogs are ruthless hustlers, and the pigs are an extravagant and disgusting political class.
The entire album is composed of a short prologue and epilogue bookending three massive fifteen-minute songs, unambiguously titled "Dogs," "Pigs (Three Different Ones)," and "Sheep" respectively. The entire album’s lyrical content is very direct. The words, while laden with emotion, don’t leave much room for creative interpretation. All the subtlety and nuance is reserved for the sound itself — dark, gritty, industrial, and brimming with meaning, yet hidden beneath countless interpretations and hours of listening.
Throughout Animals, Roger Waters, the bands bassist, vocalist, and chief songwriter for the purposes of this album, channels his own building nihilism and disillusionment with society to produce a biting critique of capitalism and the Western democratic system as a whole. When one examines the ideas and feelings that Waters alludes to throughout, the record feels eerily relevant in 2017. To hear Waters sing about the Pigs, “You’re nearly a laugh / You’re nearly a laugh / But you’re really a cry,” one can’t help but be reminded of our turbulent times. His political vision and his fearless delivery of it are what make Animals worth revisiting today. Late last year, a group of Chicago architects proposed a plan involving the blocking of the Trump Tower Chicago logo with gold balloon pigs, a direct reference to the pig floating between two of the chimneys of London’s Battersea Power Station on the cover of Animals.
With that said, enough with the foreshadowing! Here are the songs:
"Dogs":
As the first of the albums three long tracks, "Dogs" sets an aggressive, hungry, dark, and direct tone for the album. It traces the sad and lonely life of the ruthless entrepreneur. He starts out as a keen-eyed street hustler, before graduating to becoming a polished executive. He has one goal — to get ahead — and he picks out suckers, compromises his morals, and betrays his friends in its pursuit. Over time, as he gets older and starts needing care, and he comes to the horrifying conclusion that he has made no real connections in his entire life. He eventually dies of cancer, sad and alone. In his final moments, he questions the system he did so much to thrive within, and comes to believe the system was exploiting him for its benefit all along. Waters' tone within "Dogs" is withering disgust. He concludes with “Who was ground down in the end / Who was found dead on the phone / Who was dragged down by the stone.”
"Pigs (Three Different Ones)":
Rogers taunts the pigs differently than he does the dogs. With the dogs, he condescends, mirthlessly ridiculing their lives. With the pigs, he engages in satire. “Haha, charade you are” he sings, making fun of pigs for their laziness, clumsiness, and remarkably shallow sense of false dignity. However, even the laughter rings hollow, as it gradually dawns on a listener that the pigs are deeply tortured too. Rogers ultimately concludes the same thing — that for all their pomp and circumstance, the greatest joke on the pigs is that they are the saddest of all the animals. Musically, this song is the only one that borders on anything resembling positivity. The chorus actually sounds a little defiant and taunting, instead of just defeatist and dark.
"Sheep":
As the poor downtrodden masses, the sheep are happily lost in their simplicity and innocence. They seem to believe that their overlords, the dogs and the pigs, are their righteous leaders. They blindly follow the ogs to the slaughterhouse, and a horrible, painful death follows, beautifully depicted through one of guitarist Dave Gilmours most innovative solos ever. On the one side, Waters seems to sympathize with the sheep, and on the other, he seems to recoil at their naiveté. There are allusions to a desire to revolt, such as when the sheep speak of learning karate, and to the idea of religion, with the sheep seeming to find solace from their building misery in a higher power. Eleven minutes later, when the revolt finally comes, bringing the album to its epic climax, the sheep rise up against the dogs, but not the pigs.

Ah, Buggy. Why do we come together as a university to shove short people in small spaces? How did we get from rolling shopping carts down a hill to the hyper engineered fiberglass vehicles we know and love today? The Tartan went on a mission to find out.
Buggy was founded in 1920, and became an integral part of the Carnival festivities, which began in 1914. Buggy, formally known as Sweepstakes, brings together organizations from around campus to race on Tech Street, the road between campus and Flagstaff Hill. There are currently eleven active buggy organizations around campus. Per race, each team consists of five pushers and one driver.
With buggy being around for almost a century now, there have been dramatic changes in the designs of the vehicles, the rules of the race, and the spirit that surrounds it. Here are some interesting historical moments in buggy history:
- The races were originally limited to fraternal organizations, but in the 1950s, men’s dorms began to participate as well. Women entered once in 1925, but only started consistent entry in 1979.
- Two wheeled buggies became popular in the 1960’s, with Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Tau Delta Phi leading the movement.
- Up until 1981, all winning drivers were male.
- An accident during practice in 1971 brought about some of the stringent safety rules that we have today.
- Delta Gamma was the first organization to launch a fully covered buggy, but the design was unstable and wrecked both in practice and in while racing. It was soon outlawed. Rumor has it that the buggy was stolen after its last race in 1988.
- The rules of the competition were completely rewritten after a fire in a Fraternity truck in 1986.
As the event evolved, so have the teams. Here are some that have shined endured throughout history:
- Prior to World War II, Kappa Sigma, a currently inactive team, was the top team on the track. Beta Theta Pi, also inactive, was a “distant second.”
- Delta Tau Delta (DTD) conquered six out of seven years post-World War II.
- The brothers of Alpha Tau Omega (ATO) brought an impressive streak after DTD, claiming victory nine out of ten years between 1953 and 1962.
- CIA became the first non-Greek organization to win sweepstakes in 1981.
- In recent history, SDC has taken six titles in the last eight men’s races, and seven in the last ten for women’s.
- Pi Kappa Alpha (PiKA) is overall one of the most successful buggy teams in CMU history, with a monumental 26 wins in the men’s division and 11 in the women’s.
- SDC holds the current record for time, with a whopping 2:02.49 in the men’s category, set during the 2016 season.
Buggy Trivia:
1. Who broke PiKA’s record of 2:08.67 in 1988? 
2. Who broke SPIRIT's 1988 record in 2008?
3. How did the Chute flaggers come into being?
4. Racers used to practice clandestinely at night. Some late night altercations led to University-sponsored Sunday freeroll practices. What year did that occur?
5. What was the first year of Compubookie?
6. Who was the first Safety Chairman and what organization did he represent?
Answers:
1. PiKA question was the two wheeled DU Buggy King Eider with a time of 2:08.5. Spirit ran a 2:07.4 later in the day. On the 2nd day they lowered the record to 2:06.2 – that record stood until 2008.
2. SDC with a time of 2:05.55. PiKA would break the record second day with a time of 2:04.35 to SDC’s time of 2:04.50.
3. The ATO Golden Goose had limited vision so that ATO placed a young girl with a handkerchief on the curb entering the turn to signal the driver.
4. 1967 was the first organized University Sponsored freerolls! 50 years ago.
5. 1974 was the first time Compubookie appeared in The Tartan.
6. The first Safety Chairman in 1972 was Don Dietrich from Phi Kappa Theta.

With past AB concerts bringing in artists such as Walk The Moon, The Black Keys, and Matt and Kim, this years' Spring Carnival concert is breaking with the past and bringing two underdogs of the House scene to campus. 
Los Angeles based DJ Tyler Mareny, known by the stage name NGHTMRE, is coming to Pittsburgh right after he makes a stop at the Thingyan Music Festival in Myanmar. Mareny, who has been active since 2014, was born in Stamford, Conneticut, and grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina. An alum of Elon University and Icon Collective Music Production School, Mareny started his career making remixes of renowned artists such as Skrillex. Incidentally, NGHTMRE's recognition began to flourish when Skrillex himself played one of NGHTMRE's original tracks. Now the artist is touring music festivals around the world, playing original and remixed tracks, mostly within the genres of trap and house music. NGHTMRE's music carries a deep, perpetuating, vibrating undertone to it, with obscured vocals and a rumbling base. 
Since rising to fame, NGHTMRE has released an EP and collaborated with artists from throughout the EDM industry including, Flux Pavillion, Zeds Dead, and Dillon Francis. 
His accompanying act for the evening, San Holo, the stagename of Sander van Dijck, hails from the Netherlands, and has released music through some of the same labels that NGHTMRE has, including Monstercat. Van Dijck's journey began at Codarts University of the Arts, after which he ghost produced for DJs around the Netherlands. His solo career took flight soon after, and gave rise to a mix of remixes and original productions. San Holo has since been making his mark on the EDM realm, with his first EP, Cosmos, making its way to the Top 100 Electronic list on iTunes. 
We asked around, and not a lot of people on campus have heard of either act. With that in mind, here are some song reccomendations to get prepped for the concert.
What To Listen To Until Carnival:
1. "Light" — San Holo
2. "We Rise" — San Holo
3. "Fly (Original Mix)" — San Holo
4. "Old Days" — Yellow Claw, San Holo
5. "Hold Fast (feat. Tessa Douwstra)" — San Holo, Tessa Douwstra
6. "Limelight (NGHTMRE Remix)" — Just A Gent, NGHTMRE
7. "GUD VIBRATIONS" — NGHTMRE, SLANDER
8. "Need You" — Dillon Francis, NGHTMRE
9. "Burn Out" — NGHTMRE
10. "Superstar (feat. Krewella) — Pegboard Nerds, NGHTMRE, Krewella

Wilkins Block Party
Where: Veterans Pavilion, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260
When: Saturday, April 22, 12–8 p.m.
With proceeds this year going to the American Civil Liberties Union, the Wilkins Block party is an amazing was to spend Saturday afternoon. This year's party will feature artists including Beauty Slap, Memphis Hill, and Spacefish, along with food trucks and a great crowd. If you love music and you love seeing people come together, we hope to see you there. 
Spring Carnival Concert
Where: The Cut
When: Saturday, April 22, 7–10 p.m.
The carnival concert this year will be held on Saturday, April 22, at 7 p.m. on the cut. The artists this year are NGHTMRE and San Holo, and it promises to be an event to remember. The carnival concert, more than anything, is a time for the campus community to get together and let loose, with music and (hopefully) beautiful weather. It’s free for all students and definitely worth the experience.
Rides and Games
Where: The Cut
When: All weekend
What would a carnival be without rides? Carnegie Mellon’s Carnival is no different. Buy individual tickets or a day pass and check out the classic Ferris Wheel, and a variety of other zany rides to make your weekend special. Don't forget to check out some classic carnival games such as balloon shooting and try your luck to win some prizes. 
Booths and Vendors
Where: The Cut and CFA Parking Lot
When: All weekend
Organizations from all over campus take the months leading up to carnival to carefully plan and craft one and two-story booths for carnival-goers to visit. Many of these booths include games and intricately detailed decorations that impress visitors year after year and make up the heart of Carnival. Be sure to make your way over to the CFA lot to explore the “Timehop” theme booths this year, and check back here next week to see which booths take home awards for exceptional craftsmanship. Hungry? Some of these booths, along with vendors across the cut, will be selling everything from deep fried Oreo cookies to funnel cake.
Scotch'n'Soda presents: *Heathers*
Where: Cohen Center, Rangos Ballroom
When: April 20, 7 p.m, April 21, 7 p.m. and 11 p.m, April 22, 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.
One of the annual highlights of Carnival is the S'n'S musical. This year, the musical of choice is Heathers, which is probably best described as a classic '80s teen romance, at least until things start blowing up — both literally and figuratively. We recommend the 11 p.m. show if you want a hilarious and delightful experience, and any other show if you want a quiet audience. Tickets are $5 with student ID. Make sure to get your tickets ahead of time, because last year the shows sold out!   
Other things to watch out for:
Throughout the afternoon on both Friday and Saturday, be sure to take rounds of the Carnival Tent. Keep an eye out for activities such as Henna Tattoo, a Silent Disco, Face Painting, and Balloon Art. There will also be events held throughout the day at the Tennis Court Amphitheater, including a wide range of student musical performances.

Artists around the country are reflecting the reverberating impact of the election and increasing social tensions, most recently reflected in the work and controversy that arose in the Whitney Biennale. This semester has brought us, here at Carnegie Mellon, a season of art at the Frame Gallery that shows the different ways that students have been responding to the political climate. This Sunday marks the close of senior art major Jarel Grant’s solo show Textually Active, the Frame’s 2017 Grant Show.
Grant describes Textually Active as an exploration of what it means to be in a “post-racial America,” diving into the contradiction of the era the Obama presidency was meant to create and the rising hostility towards minority groups in America since then. Walking through the space is a vibrant and precise visual experience. Upon entering, the viewer is greeted by a large American flag hanging from the ceiling made of black and white fabric.  It backdrops a wooden desk on which a collection of objects is placed around a poem printed in the center. The text describes a sense of history and family, establishing a tension between personal history and political circumstance. This installation ties together the entire show, with the repetition of the American flag motif and symbolic nature of the colors established within this scene. “I voted” sticker patterns are printed on posters and the wall and a patriotic color palette is used in large-scale, layered text pieces. 
I went to this show twice: once during the opening, once the weekend after. The energy each time was drastically different, but in combination both experiences reveal the tone of the exhibition. The opening had an energy of exuberance and celebration, with lively music and people dancing as they wandered through the space and interacted with the artist. The second weekend was quieter, and the soft, reflective quality of the work became more pronounced. The brightly colored pedestals displaying zines and the larger text pieces are not like the easy, political messaging of graphic artists in the '80s. Despite the political context the installations establish, the poems and text are told through personal narratives of boyhood and blackness, contrasting the idealism and adventure of growing up that sit with more somber realities of race in America. 
The impact of Grant’s work comes from influences of both graphic works and poetry. Grant described this as his favorite challenge, “finding the balance between being simple but also having another element of complexity” through language. Simplicity with precision of play with language and cultural codes drives works such as “The Boys in #0047ab and The Boys In Blue Collars.” This piece involves layering of colored letters that combine the imagery of celebration and boyhood with references to the police. The blocks of red, white, and blue and layering of letters requires the viewer to work to decode the meaning.  The effort that goes into understanding the work is important because the show is about building a cultural language through color idioms and cultural references. 
The importance of color in the language of the exhibition comes from several sources. Two of the most influential are the Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter movements. Grant says “The book "Blue Streaks in Black Matter” is based on the vandalization of a Black Lives Matter sign (which was changed to Blue Lives Matter) outside the Unitarian Church on Morewood.” From there, he began to play with the expressions involving color and to pull new meaning from them. Certainly, it is easy to see the attention and thought that was put into connecting color to language to visuals — nothing in this show feels accidental. “Blue Streaks in Black Matter” includes few words. The poems are short but rich and the colors of text and paper interact to expand the meaning of the words. 
For the viewer who does not identify with the narrator of the story, the fact that every part of the work and curation is carefully considered is important. Not all viewers will understand each reference or experience abstracted through poetry. Foreign language learners will tell you that idioms can be the hardest thing to pick up, and much of the audience of Textually Active are a kind of foreign language learner within the show, thrust into a perspective they were not born into. The show works because the care with which each visual and verbal decision was made applies a sense of value which the viewer is obligated to reciprocate. The viewer who does not share these experiences must unpack their own cultural language and, most importantly, slow down and listen. 
Grant describes his process in part being a massive research effort. Processing the idea of “post-racial America” by reading works from black writers such as James Baldwin, Gil Scott Heron, and Countee Cullen, he searched to understand what it meant to be a black creator and writer. To do so, he had to look at his own past. The color symbolism reflects this, yellows and blues refer to cultural icons as well as personal associations with street lights and water respectively. The olive green refers to a “nourishing sheen spray” for natural hair, and the white to racial majority but also baptism and vans. The language and color symbolism moves between memories of growing up and the larger context that the artist grew up in. 
“The personal is the political” is a phrase coined by second wave feminist Carol Hanisch, which was followed by much debate surrounding the idea of identity politics. The concerns with identity politics are often about the issue of reducing someone’s whole experiences to a political prop or label. Artists often talk about their experiences to relate to broader ideas, but artists of marginalized groups often experience this issue when their work is reduced to just their identity label without nuance. For artists of color, a challenge is then to preserve personal nuance when presenting to an audience that is likely to be mostly white. This is the twofold challenge of art activism; fighting an unjust society and also working with a visual language that was built by and for the dominant group. 
The intelligent and culturally aware use of language in Textually Active is able to navigate this problem by separating personal narrative and abstract societal issues, while also pointing to the ways they are connected. The audience reads the work from the perspective of the artist first, sees the person behind the words, and then works outward to the society he is placed in. The poems, text, and visuals do indeed work with activism and serious issues in our society, but the exhibition is also a celebration of beauty and self through precision of language. Textually Active is the strong beginning of Grant’s work of activism through empathy as he continues to explore storytelling and works to honor the experiences of African-American communities.

On Thursday, April 13, it finally happened. The new Chipotle Mexican Grill opened on Forbes Avenue next to Craig Street. After months of watching the construction, the students of Carnegie Mellon University now have a Chipotle restaurant all to themselves (of course students of other colleges are always welcome).
Chipotle is one of the most popular restaurants in the country. There are three restaurants in the areas surrounding campus: on Forbes Avenue in Oakland near the University of Pittsburgh’s campus, on Baum Boulevard in Shadyside, and on Centre Avenue in East Liberty. For many Carnegie Mellon students, the closeness of the new restaurant to our campus is a big factor in the excitement. “I go to the Chipotle near Atwood a lot because it’s got good food,” first-year Jeremy Ong said. “I’m excited about it being closeby because then I won’t have to walk as far.”
The interior of the restaurant is quite narrow, with only enough space for the line and serving area. There are two small tables near the entrance with limited seating in an upstairs loft. Because it is usually busy, it is hard to find seating, and most customers have to get their food to go. For many students, however, getting food to-go is their intention.
“It was really nice,” first-year Matt Spettel said. “The line was almost out the door, but the line moved extremely quickly and the staff was nice, and they could tell that many people were in a rush because this is Carnegie Mellon. I appreciated that.” Spettel also expressed interest in potentially being able to use DineX at Chipotle. The Carnegie Mellon Undergraduate Student Senate has a petition on change.org to add Chipotle as a DineX location in addition to Eat’n Park, Eat Unique, Quiznos, Subway, and Vocelli Pizza.
At the time of writing, the petition, which was started on the restaurant’s opening day, has already amassed 465 signatures in support. Only 35 more students are needed to reach its goal of 500 signatures. Students’ reasons for signing include the wish for more options to use DineX, especially for those who finish the semester with a lot left over in their accounts. There is also an interest in diversifying Carnegie Mellon’s meal plan, and all students who signed the petition emphasized their love for Chipotle and how the use of DineX would be a great incentive to eat there more. “That would be an absolute game changer,” first-year Sarina Stein said on potentially using DineX at Chipotle. “I would eat there a lot.”

Recently, Congress has been on its April recess session, so many congressmen are holding town halls in their home states to take questions and hear concerns from their constituents. Bob Casey, the Democratic senator from Pennsylvania, was no exception. He has held a series of town halls in various locations in the state, including one last week at University of Pittsburgh’s Alumni Hall.
The town hall focused on three major themes — healthcare policy, environmental pollution concerns, and American involvement in Syria. Many voters were concerned about these issues and had strong feelings about them, which was evident by the number of questions about these topics.
One environmental concern that was brought up several times during the town hall was fracking. Casey supports fracking since he believes it creates jobs, is relatively clean (a thought which was met with many disagreeing signs), and enhances our national security by lessening our dependence on Middle Eastern oil. While he does believe that there should be regulations concerning the right of local residents to know what chemicals are used in fracking and that fracking must be consistent with state and federal rules, many attendees disagreed and thought that it would be better for Pennsylvania to end fracking for good.
There was a woman who told a story about how her health has spiraled downhill because of environmental pollution and how she is now concerned for her grandchildren. Casey thanked her for telling her story and said that we must hold parties accountable for pollution and introduce a budget to account for environmental issues — the Trump budget does not provide this. He mentioned that citizens concerned about the environment should support the Clean Power Plan and the overturning of the Citizens United case to lessen the influence of dark money in politics. He invited anyone with ideas to submit plans for an energy proposal that would be better than the current one. Throughout the town hall, he reiterated the theme of being vigilant and fighting back against the harmful policies that the far right has espoused.
Healthcare was another major theme, given that the GOP bill to overturn the Affordable Care Act (ACA) recently failed. Casey suggested that many Democrats got a false sense of security when the GOP bill failed, and reminded the attendees that the GOP has done nothing to actually improve the healthcare system. He reminded people that it was necessary to call out the GOP’s efforts to defund Planned Parenthood and turn Medicare into a voucher program, which he said was the fastest way to destroy Medicare, which many rural Pennsylvanians use. Casey also mentioned the ACA’s successes in increasing coverage rates, prohibiting the denial of coverage based on pre-existing conditions, and prohibiting gender-based discrimination. In response to an attendee questioning him about why he doesn’t support Medicare for all, he mentioned a bill he and Bernie Sanders were co-sponsoring that would allow the importing of cheaper medicines from Canada, and said there should be a public option for Medicare.
The issue that seemed to divide the room was Syria. Casey said that while he believed President Trump’s strike on Assad’s military bases was an appropriate response to the horror of the chemical attack, the president must have a longer-term plan for the future of Syria that should not include ground troops. However, many in the room were fed up with U.S. intervention in the Middle East and saw it as yet another one of the mistakes Americans made in Iraq and Afghanistan, and thus disagreed with Casey’s position. Several protesters went through the room holding signs and chanting “No more war.” Casey did reiterate several times throughout the town hall, however, that there must be a debate in Congress over the use of military force on foreign countries, which he believed has been inappropriately lessened during both the current administration and the Obama administration.
There were a few questions relating to the peculiarities of the Trump administration as well. One voter expressed her concerns about the high costs of taxpayer-funded presidential security. This question resonated with a lot of the other attendees, as a wave of agree signs went up at the mention of these security costs. Casey responded by saying that while a president and his family are by law guaranteed Secret Service protection, he hoped that the administration would reexamine its budget priorities and not cut essential programs and services in the name of security.
Another question that drew applause was asked by a young girl, who was upset about the fact that President Trump wants to shut America’s door on Syrian refugees. Casey agreed with the girl’s words. He said that barring Syrian refugees does not make us any safer, and that it was unfair that people who had already undergone an extensive vetting process were suddenly being turned away.
In regards to the Russian investigation, Casey commanded the Republican senators who were making a serious effort at investigating any possible ties between Trump and Russia. He said he wishes that Trump would put out a statement saying that Russia must not interfere in our elections again, no matter whom they are trying to help.
There were also some concerns about how the Democratic Party would fare in future elections and about the lack of a strong central message from the party. Casey agreed, saying that the party has needed a stronger central message for a while as it moved away from the main economic and jobs focused message from several years ago. However, he emphasized the importance of stopping the most extreme parts of the GOP agenda from going forward in addition to creating this message.

Dining Services has recently announced two new search features on the Dining Services website which will allow students and community members to more easily search for soups and daily specials offered at dining locations throughout Carnegie Mellon.
The new Today's Soups feature allows users to see what soups are offered at locations such as Au Bon Pain and the Underground. Choices may range from chicken noodle soup to corn chowder or broccoli and cheddar. Similarly, the new Today's Specials feature allows users to see specials that are being served at locations such as Au Bon Pain, the Underground, and the Exchange. Choices may range from turkey swiss BLT to the “PACO” sandwich or a buffalo shrimp wrap.
This addition was first sought after Dining Services’ Advisory Council reported that they would love to have a more organized way of knowing specials and soups that are being offered across campus on any particular day.
Mandi Semple, the director of marketing for student affairs operations, stated that a Facebook post on To Dining with Love, which is run by Carnegie Mellon students, also stated that students would love to have a soup Twitter account where students could see what soups were being offered across campus. A lot of students responded favorably to this suggestion and stated that they would love to see something like this be offered. “I kept that in the back of my mind as we were building this new feature,” Semple said. While this new feature isn’t connected to Twitter, it is a place online where the community can be better informed about their dining options.
Why the specific focus on soups, you may ask? Semple has noticed that this is a soup heavy campus where people talk about soup a lot, especially students who are interested in vegan and vegetarian soup options. “That’s been something that we hear a lot from students who want to know what those options are.” She also adds that for cold Pittsburgh days, soup is one comfort food that a lot of community members tend to reach for.
“Our goal with our website and everything we do is to continue to find ways to enhance the dining experience for students and community members on campus when we hear requests such as this,” Semple said. Dining Services is aware that Carnegie Mellon’s dining program is unique since there isn’t one dining hall where all food options are right in one place. “Food options are spaced out all across campus,” Semple said. “If we can find a way to help students make better choices before they venture out, maybe they’ll find something new and different that they like.”
The new soup and daily specials features add to Dining Services’ goal of communicating more effectively with students while also creating a fresh new design that blends in with the new cmu.edu website.
Community members may have noticed that, in the previous system, times for dining locations were listed but required new updates depending on special circumstances such as holidays. As a solution, Semple says that dining services updated the website so that it now has “one data entry portal where we could put in special hours.” Hours are put in one place so that the site has a live update of places that are open or closed, not just listed times. Adding the new soup and daily specials features is just another way Dining Services is striving to make the dining experience at Carnegie Mellon easy and enjoyable.
“Dining is always striving to enhance the dining experience on campus for students, faculty, and staff. We hope these two new features will be ones that can serve you on a daily basis,” Dining Services stated in a press release.

Laverne Cox, transgender activist and Emmy-nominated actress of Orange is the New Black, spoke to a packed crowd at Carnegie Mellon’s Wiegand Gymnasium last Thursday. Her speech was jointly sponsored by the Activities Board, CMU Allies, Residential Education, the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama, Student Dormitory Council, Student Senate, and the Graduate Student Assembly. Tickets were free for Carnegie Mellon faculty, staff, and students, and  a limited number were released to the general public for $15.
Cox opened her hour-long speech by claiming her identity as a “proud African-American transgender woman” to enthusiastic cheers from the audience. She thanked the audience for their support, which after a challenging week she found “deeply healing.” The audience laughed and cheered enthusiastically at several points throughout the speech.
Cox told her personal story of growth, from her childhood in Alabama to her adolescence at dance school to her burgeoning womanhood in New York City. Her speech was full of anecdotes and life lessons. She discussed the rampant bullying and shame she suffered as a child, from students who policed her gender expression with homophobic slurs to a third-grade teacher who warned her mother that, without immediate therapy, “your son is going to end up in New Orleans in a dress.”
Cox also talked about how the vibrant New York drag queen and trans community helped provide her with the courage to transition. “Trans was not associated with successful and accomplished, and I was groomed to be a successful and accomplished young person,” Cox said about her first exposure to the community. “We have misconceptions about people who are different but when we just need to get to know those people as people, all those misconceptions will melt away.”
Cox made multiple references to famous feminist writings that have influenced and inspired her, such as Sojourner Truth’s “Ain’t I a Woman” speech about black womanhood, Simone de Beauvoir’s work on gender as a social construct, and Judith Butler’s theory that gender identity is performed. “One is not born a woman, one becomes one,” Cox quoted from Butler’s Gender Trouble. “Nowhere is it guaranteed that the one who becomes a woman is necessarily female,” she quoted from de Beauvoir.
The main theme of Cox’s speech was how the intersections of her identity — race, gender, and class — have deeply shaped her experience. She spoke out against the “devaluation of black womanhood,” the disproportionate rates of suicide and violence against trans women of color, and the violence inherent in misgendering a trans person. She also spoke of the need for minority solidarity rather than infighting.
“Often marginalized people will police each other,” said Cox. “That is the tool of the oppressor.”
She stressed the importance of supporting trans rights, especially in the current political climate, where transgender and gender non-conforming people are “deeply shamed, stigmatized, criminalized, and objectified.” She spoke of the need to fight back with love against discriminatory bathroom bills and Trump’s rescinding of Obama-era federal guidelines for the fair treatment of transgender students in schools, as well as to fight for the right of LGBTQ persons to be included in a federal census. “Justice is what love looks like in public,” Cox said. “We just want to be counted.”
Cox closed her speech with a call to action, stating that we need to “create safe spaces to have difficult conversations across differences” guided by “love and empathy,” where people don’t have to be afraid of saying the wrong thing.
Cox’s speech was followed by a 20-minute question and answer session with the audience. One audience member asked her about Orange is the New Black, which she said “opened so many doors for me and I’m so grateful.” When asked about her future goals, Cox said: “I want to expand my brand... I want to be a better businesswoman, and I want to have more control.” As she exited the stage, Cox waved to thunderous applause and a standing ovation.

A few weeks ago, Congress passed a bill allowing internet service providers (ISPs) to sell their users’ browsing history without the users’ permission. Currently, the only hurdle the bill has left to overcome is a signature by President Donald Trump, who seems to be against net neutrality, the principle that ISPs should provide equal access to all services and website, regardless of source.
The Republican majority Congress voted to deny a privacy law the Obama administration passed in its final days. Under that law, the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) would have required ISPs to ask their users before sharing their browsing history. Furthermore, ISPs would have been required to alert users of a hacking breach. All these precautions are under attack now, and sharing browsing history without permission is still legal.
Internet companies have had the legal right to sell browsing data for some time now. Google, for example, makes a large portion of its revenue by selling search data to advertising companies. However, Google keeps this browsing history anonymized. This means that the bill Congress passed is not a change, but a preservation of the status quo.
Browsing data is a gold mine for advertising companies, as it reveals customer’s shopping trends, motivations, and interests. Thanks to technology, for the first time in history, companies have a wealth of information (referred to as Big Data) that shows what kinds of products customers would buy, and what kind of advertising has the most efficacy. This means that there is no more need for cumbersome focus groups. Companies could potentially drive their profits way up with this data, which is why this bill is their dream come true. To the everyday user, this just shows how much companies can analyze and manipulate their customers in order to increase profit — which is a trend pervasive in capitalism.
Few people, even conservative citizens, feel comfortable with this development. The new bill goes against conservatives’ ethos of small government. Deducing Congress’ motivations is thus a guessing game. A possible hunch is that ISPs may be lobbying Republican representatives by offering increased financial support, much like the National Rifle Association does whenever open gun ownership is threatened with checks.
Or perhaps Congress may just be following the Republican agenda of undoing anything and everything Obama-related. We saw this with Trump’s approval of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a project President Obama had halted. Then, we saw this in the failed attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, an action that would have cut off millions of Americans from decent health care. Just this month, we saw Obama’s policy of indirect military action in Syria shredded by the launch of 59 tomahawk missiles into the war-torn nation, a command Trump gave over dessert.
It doesn’t help that the Obama administration attempted to pass the FCC bill in its final days. Representatives probably viewed this as a last-minute, erratic action that should not have been attempted in an election year; hence, its undoing. A similar excuse was given when Merrick Garland, United States Court of Appeals chief judge, was offered the Supreme Court nomination by President Obama in 2016.
No matter what Congress’ true intentions are behind this bill, it’s clear that partisanship plays a large role in it. The polarization of American politics today, exemplified by the last election season, has placed Washington under gridlock time and time again; nevertheless, protection of user data should not be a Republican-Democrat battleground, but an American issue. Since the onslaught of the War on Terror, the U.S. government has conducted mass surveillance of its own citizens, a haunting truth outed by infamous former NSA employee Edward Snowden. Should this bill pass, our government would have failed to protect the privacy of the American people once again.
It would be a mistake to assume that Congress is solely to blame for the decreasing respect for internet privacy; ISPs are equally at fault. They attack user rights continually, and the fight for net neutrality demonstrates this. Net neutrality is still a much-debated topic of argument in American politics today, despite a growing concern that denying it will be increasingly annoying and harmful for users. Comcast’s slowing of streaming speeds on Netflix, its rival website, was hurtful to fair competition. And today, ISPs’ wishes to sell browsing history for profit continues the trend of hurting users.
Expectedly, many are protesting the FCC bill. Instead of asking for its repeal, people online are awaiting its passing, so they can purchase and share the browsing history of representatives who supported it — a taste of their own medicine. This won’t be possible, however, since the sharing of individually identifiable information is prohibited by the Telecommunications Act. One could argue that purposefully targeted ads by corporations are identifiable information, but the wording of the Act becomes much more lenient when dealing with aggregate customer information and data anonymization. Up to $140,000 has been raised to purchase this browsing history that will never be up for sale.
Are there steps you can take to protect your browsing history? Absolutely. ISPs can monitor what websites you visit, even after you’ve locally clear that your browsing history, thanks to internet protocol (IP) addresses. IP addresses are unique nine-digit numbers that identify computers and the webpages they request. It’s possible to adopt a temporary IP address with a virtual private network, which can be turned on easily in any computer or phone’s settings. Another more robust option is to use an infamous program called Tor, which makes your computer completely anonymous.
If you do not wish to protect your browsing history because you have nothing to hide, that’s equally acceptable. All evidence thus far suggests that it will be anonymized. But, as the saying goes, it’s better to be safe than sorry.

It’s a well-worn political cliche to say that rival factions within a political movement (e.g. the Tea Party vs. moderate Republicans) are “fighting for the soul” of their party. And the same cliche has been used time and again in the aftermath of 2016 to describe the tension within the Democratic party between its progressive movement and its more moderate “establishment.” Like most cliches, this characterization isn’t without truth — elements within the Democratic Party certainly are vying to shape its message and determine its strategy. But like most cliches, this is also a somewhat stale and hackneyed way to describe what’s going on. In truth, the party is struggling to rediscover its soul altogether.
A recent report from The New York Times showed that approximately one in four white working class voters who had voted for Barack Obama in 2012 switched to vote for Donald Trump in 2016. Factors like a voter’s political party and their previous voting history are typically some of the strongest metrics analysts can use to predict who someone will support in an election. But in 2016, an unusually high amount of registered Democrats and Obama voters switched to support Trump, often switching to vote for Republicans down the ballot as well. Although much has been made about turnout — high turnout in rural areas of key swing states and low turnout in urban areas — The New York Times argues that the real story — the real puzzle — of 2016 was why so many Obama voters favored Trump.
More puzzling still, the very voters that jumped the Democratic ship in 2016 and handed Donald Trump the White House were once the heart and soul of the Democratic Party. The white working class has long been a core Democratic constituency, but they have been steadily bleeding from the Democratic Party over the past few decades. Their departure has been fueled by declining union membership, escalating culture wars, and economic disaffection. Even though Clinton couldn’t have expected to win this block of voters given recent voter trends, her paltry performance among them, including even those who had voted twice for Obama, should warn Democrats that they need to act quickly to reclaim the voters who were once their base.
Ultimately, it all comes down to message and political strategy. Fortunately for Democrats, we don’t have to figure out something totally new. We just have to return to the messages and strategies that have served Democrats for decades. We need to rediscover our heart and soul. That’s how we’ll win.
Democrats already have the best policies for this block of voters. Nobody benefits more from strong unions and a higher minimum wage than the working class. Nor does any group stand to gain more from a robust social safety net, universal healthcare, and strong investments in public education. But ask any white working class Trump voter why they voted for Trump, and jobs and the economy will be at the top of the list. Those of us cloistered in our ivory towers and cosmopolitan utopias often muse condescendingly about why poor white voters “vote against their self-interest.” Well, they don’t. At least not what they understand those interests to be. Nobody goes out and votes for what they think will hurt themselves. Politics is about who can make the better argument. And Democrats have lost the argument about which party is better for working people because our message has been flawed. Democrats need to return to the messages that resonate with all voters: “We will help you get a well-paying job. We will help your family and your community thrive.”
Democrats also need to return back to the strategic models that have helped them win elections in the past. Historically, Democrats have a built-in advantage when it comes to grassroots organizing, field strategy, and voter turnout operations. When Democratic campaigns are at their best, they are fueled by people: union canvassers, energetic students and young people, Democratic committee people and their families, etc. When Democratic campaigns win, it is because they have a groundswell of people behind them; people who are passionate about their causes and bring electricity to the campaign.
But Democrats have been seduced by the siren song of money in politics. This is where Republicans excel, and Democratic leaders have sought in recent years to beat Republicans at their own game. But that is a foolish exercise. Republican voters simply have more money than Democratic voters. Far more millionaires and billionaires support Republicans. Ditto for corporations. Democrats have made raising huge sums of money from wealthy voters and corporations central to their strategy, convinced that if they can bring in the most money, the rest will fall into place. Certainly, money has an unfortunate power in today’s politics, and if Democrats can’t fundraise, they can’t compete. But Democrats will never be able to raise money the way Republicans do. And when they try to cozy up to wealthy donors and Wall Street, all they end up doing is alienating the people at their base.
If Democrats want to win in the future, they need to embrace grassroots fundraising models like the one employed by Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I–VT) campaign. In 2015-2016 Sanders raised millions upon millions of dollars from small-dollar donations averaging just $27. If Democrats can emulate this model, they can bring synergy between the need for money in today’s politics and their greatest strength, which is their people.
Democrats shouldn’t be battling for their party’s soul. Instead, the different ideological factions within the party must work together to rediscover what once made them a great and successful political movement. Democrats have always disagreed. We’ll never be of one voice on every aspect of policy. But Democrats succeed when they have a strong message about the economy, and when they fuel their campaigns not with big money, but with committed people. That’s where the heart and soul of the Democratic party lies. It’s a party comprised of ordinary people fighting for policies that help ordinary people. Going forward, Democrats need to put working people back at the center of their platform, their message, and their political strategy.

After the Republicans’ failure to pass their Affordable Care Act (ACA) replacement, the American Health Care Act (AHCA), House Speaker Paul Ryan declared the ACA "the law of the land ... for the foreseeable future," but that fact hasn't dissuaded Republicans from continuing to brainstorm ACA alternatives. The Democrats, on the other hand, have been relatively hesitant to present new ideas in healthcare reform, a seemingly reasonable position, considering their current lack of control in any branch of government, but it is precisely their current dearth of power that necessitates the excitement for the Democratic Party that a more progressive plan would generate. Now is the time for Democrats to begin seriously considering universal health care.
Universal health care is about ensuring that everyone, regardless of their income status, gender, or anything else, has access to the medical care they need. It's about guaranteeing people the basic freedom to live healthy, fulfilling lives. A person who can't afford treatment for an illness or injury is not free, since, depending on the nature of the condition, they might not be able to run, walk, go to school, go to work, pursue their dreams, or attain physical comfort. Health care policy that does not guarantee coverage for all is, therefore, an obstruction to freedom-for-all. Universal health care would be consistent with American ideals because it would increase access to such quintessentially American values such as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
The AHCA, which kept the ACA provisions on preexisting conditions and under 25-year-olds staying on their parents' plans while revamping nearly everything else, failed because it was a centrist proposal that made no one happy. Far-right and libertarian Republicans, as represented by the Freedom caucus, felt that the AHCA didn't move far enough away from the ACA, while moderates of both parties and progressive Democrats had liked the ACA and felt that Ryan's new bill was a step in the wrong direction, especially after the Congressional Budget Office released a report stating that the AHCA would leave 24 million fewer insured by 2026.
Even the ACA was somewhat of a compromise. The ACA's individual mandate aspect, which funds the insurance by requiring anyone not already covered by an employer to have ACA coverage, actually dates back to a plan proposed in the '80s by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, as an alternative to single-payer coverage (universal health care entirely funded by the government). The individual mandate has also been appropriated over the years by many other conservatives, such as Mitt Romney in his Massachusetts health care reform of 2006. Because the ACA used an individual mandate, it was supposed to be bipartisan, consensus legislation, but instead, the bill was subject to much obstructionism at the hands of the Republicans.
What Barack Obama missed in planning his bill was that Republicans always saw individual mandates as a compromise. Most Republicans, including Ryan himself, who advanced an individual mandate bill of his own to reform Medicare in 2011, only ever liked the idea of the individual mandate in comparison to more socialist options like single-payer or Medicare. The plan was always to use individual mandate reforms as a stepping stone and not an end goal. When Obama, a liberal Democrat, started his health care reform at individual mandates, he advanced a plan that no one was truly enthused about and moved everyone to the right. Having secured the center, Republicans were now free to focus on more conservative reform options.
Democrats must not let the ACA become the new left. They must learn from the failures of so-called compromise bills like the AHCA and ACA to garner widespread support: centrist reform makes no one happy. Universal health care, on the other hand, garners bipartisan progressive support. A May 2016 Gallup poll found that the majority of Americans, including even a significant chunk of Republicans, want to replace the ACA with a single-payer system. A universal coverage system like single-payer provides a cohesive solution to health care consistent with progressive and American values that people can truly get behind.
Now that the AHCA is off the table, Democrats must take this opening to advance a universal coverage plan such as single-payer insurance. There is even already a proposed single-payer bill that has been in the works in the House since 2003. Introduced by Representative John Conyers (D–MI), the Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act would, as promised in name, install universal health care in America by expanding the current Medicare system. Such a plan would fix the remaining issues left by the ACA, ensuring that anyone with an injury or illness has the resources to heal. Such a bill would gain enthusiastic support and restore public faith in the Democratic Party at a time when the Party needs it most.
If the Democrats wait too long, Republicans will come up with a more conservative plan to generate similar enthusiastic support from their own base — enough to actually pass this time. An additional bonus of advancing a single-payer bill like Conyers' is that it would restore individual mandates to the center and force conservative Republicans to support the ACA, as a truly moderate alternative.
If the Republicans manage to pass a more conservative bill, the number insured would surely decrease. Republicans would claim such a bill as a win for their party, but in reality, it would be a loss for the American public. A nation is only as healthy as its citizens, and a nation where it is possible for a citizen to be ill and uninsured is certainly unwell.

After months of consistent protests, South Korea, as of March 9, 2017, has successfully impeached the former president Park Geun-Hye; since March 30, she has been under arrest. The world watched in fascination as hundreds of thousands of Koreans expressed their discontent through rallies starting Oct. 26, 2016, which included a candlelight rally involving an estimated of 1.7 million people on the streets. In response to the impeachment, American television actor Chris Meloni comically tweeted: "Dear South Korea, how? Asking for a country." Certainly, Meloni is not alone in feeling this way; the thousands of retweets and likes confirm that others have at least considered this sentiment worthy of their attention.
As a U.S. citizen who voted in the 2016 presidential election and a daughter of two Korean citizens, this tweet called me to compare the nation I proudly call home to the country my parents call home. While people in the U.S. were glued to their screens watching the presidential debates leading up to the election in November 2016, people in Korea gave their government a piece of their minds by congregating in the streets and demanding that Park step down.
Park was a historic president for South Korea; not only was she the first female president, but she was also the first president to be impeached. The daughter of the late former leader Park Chung-hee represented the Saenuri Party, now the Liberty Korea Party, and won the presidential election on Feb. 25, 2013. However, her popularity rapidly went downhill starting in Oct. 2016 when a journalist of JoongAng Ilbo Tongyang Broadcasting Company (JTBC) found the tablet of Park's longtime friend, Choi Soon-Sil.
This tablet, which lacked password protection, was disposed right outside Choi's residence and contained confidential information, including major presidential speeches and important national security and diplomatic documents. As a result, Park was accused of leaking official state documents to Choi Soon-Sil, who gave Park "her personal opinion" despite her not holding any public office. This led to a public apology from Park, in which she apologized for sharing the state documents and admitted that Choi looked at "some documents," although not specifying which documents or with what purpose. She tried to redeem herself by claiming she did so "out of pure heart," but the country was not convinced.
The people were unhappy with Choi not only because of the obvious breech of national security, but also because of discontent with Choi's family. Choi is the daughter of the late Choi Tae-Min, a religious cult leader and former mentor of Park, following Park's mother's assassination in 1974. The connection was initiated when he allegedly had a dream that Park's mother appeared in and asked him to help her. He established the Eternal Life Church as the "Future Buddha" and asked diplomats to refer to him as "Korea's Rasputin" in private. However, Choi was a "pseudo-pastor" who used Park in order to secure bribes in hopes to receive political gain.
Park's approval ratings prior had fit in the 30 to 50 percent range during her first three years in office. However, this scandal plummeted the approval rating to 21.1 percent, which ultimately slipped down to a mere 4 percent. The approval rates of the conservatives in the southeast, who had generally been most supportive of Park, fell in the single digit zone, and zero percent of Koreans under the age of 30 supported Park.
These mind-boggling statistics came to life on the streets. South Koreans decided they'd had enough with a government being prodded by the president's friend. Thus, people of all ages gathered together to hold candles and signs asking Korea "who's the real president?" This sparked a movement of protests for the following months. In response, Park made a second apology on Nov. 4, promising to take responsibility if she was found guilty. Her third apology came not too long after, where she, on the 20th of the same month, admitted to being willing to resign by asking Parliament how and when to give up her power. On Dec. 9, Parliament voted to impeach Park, and on March 9, the Constitutional Court unanimously upheld this decision.
Today, Korea finds their election, which was originally supposed to be held on Dec. 20, 2017, pushed up to May 2017. Moon Jae-In represents the Democratic Party and had a strong lead in the polls until recently; Moderate Ahn Cheol-Soo of the center-left People's Party has received support from a wide range of people including conservatives, centrists, and skeptics of Moon. Despite the fact that Moon was on the trajectory of becoming the next president, according to analysts, Ahn now regularly stands within a few points from Moon, and some polls even put Ahn ahead of Moon. In a poll, Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) showed, with a 95 percent confidence interval, 38 percent of Korean voters supported Moon and 35 percent supported Ahn. This is an increase of 25 percentage points for Ahn within the past two weeks. With less than a month before Koreans officially cast their votes, it is nearly impossible to state who will succeed Park. Whether the next president is Ahn or Moon, Korea will now enter a new chapter in history that demonstrates the people's power in a democratic society.
Now, in regards to Meloni's tweet, there are many reasons why the people of South Korea were discontent with their democracy and even more reasons leading up to the impeachment. Although we may not be able to perfectly emulate their strategy or even get the desired result, their resilience is truly worthy of attention and has ultimately overthrown their president. The people united to achieve their common goal — bringing a democracy that represented them, not the interests of a select few. They expressed their beliefs in such a strikingly peaceful manner. Each poster, testimony, popular song that was modified to criticize Park, and candle coalesced to form a force that proved the importance of the people in a democracy.

Everyone has a “type.” Whether funny or serious, suave or dorky, broad or slender, artistic or athletic — or all of the above — everyone has their own preferences in dating. These are usually based on personal background, past experiences, sense of humor… the list is endless. And, in general, harmless, too.
Except when it’s not.
Except when someone’s “type” is based on stereotype, a preconceived image, a media-induced trope. When one such type is embraced by many and accelerated into a social phenomenon, until it earns its own name — “yellow fever.”
Defenders of this tendency, in which men choose to date exclusively Asian women, claim that it’s harmless — that these men only pursue Asian women because they prefer physically Asian features, or because they admire that culture and heritage.
This, in and of itself, is not harmful. Preference for certain physical characteristics is natural, and, of course, not racist. However, “yellow fever” is, unfortunately, not solely due to physical preferences.
In a couple of articles published over the last few weeks, staffwriter Brandon Schmuck defended the trend by arguing that this preference for Asian women stems from many different reasons, varying from person to person, and therefore is not inherently racist.
Unfortunately, this trend is not a result of a multitude of reasons; despite the complexity of human attraction, it is simple enough to generalize the central, most damaging reason. While there are, of course, some men who prefer Asian women for solely physical or cultural reasons, the defining characteristic of this movement, and the reason it has garnered such fervid criticism, is racial stereotyping.
Schmuck stated in his last article that “People are attracted to various traits … and this attraction is rooted on a subconscious level.” Very true. So is racism.
This historically intricate prejudice has transformed and developed over its many years of existence in this country. Over the past few years, conscious racism has faded away, at least in communities of education and intellect. What is left is subconscious racism — a lingering but very potent remnant of the prejudice that has afflicted this society for so long.
No upstanding citizen would consider themselves to be racist. Yet it persists, subtle perceptions and images that affect our thought patterns, little actions, and, yes, attractions.
These men who suffer from “yellow fever” are, most likely, not intentionally idealizing Asian women, nor would they consider themselves to be racist. They admire physical features, yes, but they also subconsciously project preconceived images onto any Asian woman that they see, so that she automatically becomes more attractive because of those perspectives.
It is these images that are so harmful in this society, these stereotypes that have caused such a vitriolic reaction to “yellow fever.” These various images of submission and docility or exoticism and intrigue still reside in our culture regarding Asian women, and have taken shape in this bizarre social phenomenon.
One may argue further that racial preferences are unrelated to stereotypes. But speaking as an Asian woman who’s been pursued specifically because of her ethnicity, it doesn’t feel innocent, or complimentary, or appreciative of culture. It feels degrading. It feels stained, foul. It feels like every stereotype of submission or exoticism forced on me at once.
It is true that we live within a political bubble, and it is an admirable pursuit to expand on-campus discussion to include complex and lesser-heard opinions. I agree that every opinion is worthy of being heard — and disputed. So don’t be astonished, then, when an opinion that affronts and, for some, personally insults, receives a lavish and ardent response.

For a country that boasts fair and free elections, the United States of America has an extensive history of hosting regulations preventing its citizens from participating in a democratic society. In 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment legally allowed black men to vote. In 1920, the Nineteenth Amendment prohibited gender from being a factor in letting a vote count. However, constitutional amendments only have so much effect. There are many barriers that prevent many black Americans, especially in the south, from their right to participate in a democratic government. In 1965, once the Voting Rights Act (VRA) was signed and officially enacted, the national fight for suffrage seemed to be over. Unfair voting regulations that disproportionately targeted black voters, such as literacy tests, were deemed unconstitutional, yet that did not prevent partisan measures from finding ways to skew elections in their respective party’s favor.
Writer Ari Berman noticed this lack of coverage of voting rights, or some people’s lack thereof, between 1965 and present-day. He took initiative on informing people about this ongoing issue by writing Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America and visiting Carnegie Mellon University on March 12. “We are in 2017, but our voting protection laws are starting to look like they’re from 1817,” Berman stated. He argued that the rise of new voting regulations, coupled with fear of voter fraud, could be a threat to democracy as we know it.
Thus far, it has been primarily Republicans being caught attempting to meddle with voting regulations. In 2010, Shelby County in Alabama filed a court case claiming the VRA, specifically Section 4(b) and 5, was unconstitutional and an instance in which federal government interfered with what should be within state boundaries. Section 4(b) defined an eligible voting district as any state or district in a state in which a voting test was held starting November 1, 1964 and had less than 50 percent turnout for the 1964 presidential election; Section 5 prohibited eligible districts, as defined in Section 4(b), from altering election laws and procedures without gaining official authorization. Ultimately, this pivotal portion of the VRA was deemed unconstitutional.
Although it may be easy to dismiss a suburban area in Alabama, it is imperative to realize this was among one of many strides made by states to silence voters. For example, it is still difficult for many citizens to acquire a form of legal identification; states limiting what they recognize as a legitimate form of identification for voting further exacerbates the problem at hand. In Texas, one can vote with a concealed-weapon permit but not with a student ID. In addition, Arizona, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Ohio do not accept student IDs. Those who support the Republican Party are more likely to have such forms of identifications than those who support the Democratic Party.
North Carolina shows a further instance of voter suppression. The largely Republican Legislature requested data of voting preference by race, which allowed them to propose a bill that greatly reduced early voting, including several days of Sunday voting. This disproportionately affected black voters, and North Carolina exposed their intention behind the bill when explaining their bill’s effect on “counties with Sunday voting,” which were “disproportionately black...[and] disproportionately Democratic.” The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit saw straight through this transparent bill and denounced it as a bill that “target[ed] African Americans with almost surgical precision,” thus blocking it. However, North Carolina was still successful in significantly reducing early voting.
In consideration of strides to suppress votes such as those, it is troubling, yet worth noting, that voter turnout hit a low in the 2016 presidential election. Many eligible voters were unable to do so. Although many may have not voted because of factors such as misleading poll numbers, a significant portion of this country had their voices ignored.
Where our country heads from this point forward is uncertain. As former president Barack Obama said, there have been consistent efforts to “turn back the clock [of] progress” by undermining the VRA “from the moment the ink was dry.” Although hurdles such as the Shelby County vs. Holder case has created a bar preventing many from voting, Obama calls for us to remember that “progress does not come easy, but that it must be vigorously defended and built upon for ourselves and future generations.” With a president in office who, through Twitter, set off conspiracies of voter fraud, it is imperative for us all to remain cognizant of our right to freedom of speech and democracy’s gift to the people — the right to cast their ballots.
