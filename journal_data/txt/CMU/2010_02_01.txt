Over the past two weeks, the Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team played five hard-fought games but were unable to snap an 11-game losing streak.
On Jan. 19, it appeared as though the Tartans were going to come away with a home victory against the Pioneers of Marietta, but were beat by an eight-foot shot at the buzzer. The 69–67 loss dropped the Tartans to 4–10 while the Pioneers moved to an even 8–8.
The Tartans came out hot, going on a 12–0 run and sinking 100 percent of their first seven shots. Junior Matt Pettit led the charge, scoring nine of the team’s first 12 points. With 5:36 remaining in the first half, it looked as though the Tartans were going to have a big lead going into the break, but a 17–2 run by the Pioneers put them just one point behind the home team at the end of the half. With just one minute remaining in the game, the Tartans went to the foul line four times but were only able to convert on two of the opportunities, tying the score at 67–67 with just 6.2 seconds left on the clock. The few seconds were just enough for the Pioneers to get off one final shot to come away with a victory.
“We came out strong and were shooting really well from the field early in the first half,” said Pettit, who led the Tartans with 16 points. “Putting two solid halves together is something we have been struggling with this year, and we need to figure out a way to maintain the momentum.”
During the weekend of Jan. 22, the Tartans hosted University Athletic Association (UAA) opponents University of Chicago and Washington University in St. Louis. On Friday, the Tartans dropped a 71–57 decision to the Maroons of Chicago. The Maroons took control of the game from the start, going on a 12–0 run, and maintained the lead for the rest of the game. Sophomore John Duhring led the Tartans with 13 points, followed by junior Shane Rife with 10 points.
On Sunday, the Tartans were unable to rebound from Friday’s loss and dropped an 81–60 decision to the Bears of Washington University. The loss put the Tartans at 0–5 in league play while the Bears moved to 4–1. The Tartans only took the lead once during the game and shot 30.8 percent from the field. Duhring once again led the Tartans with 17 points, followed by Pettit, who finished with 13.
After a week of practice, the Tartans traveled to New York and Boston for another UAA weekend. On Friday the Tartans lost a close game to New York University, falling 59–57. 
The loss was a back-and-forth game with four lead changes in the second half alone, but the Violets were able to hold off the Tartans for the last 1:24 to come away with the victory.
On Sunday, the Tartans lost their seventh straight UAA game, falling to Brandeis University 72–59. Senior Jack Anderson led the Tartans with 15 points, followed by Pettit, who cashed in for 14.
The Tartans are now 4–14 overall and 0–7 in league play.
The team will be back in action next weekend as the Tartans take on New York University and Brandeis in Skibo Gymnasium.

The women’s basketball team finished a competitive two weeks — and the first half — of University Athletics Association (UAA) league play, squaring off against the University of Chicago, Washington University in Saint Louis, New York University, and Brandeis University. 
Although the Tartans tallied four tough losses, the team remains confident for the second half of UAAs. Carnegie Mellon’s record is now 8–10 overall and 1–6 in the UAA.
The squad lost at home to Chicago on Jan. 22, 51–76. Sophomore guard Ali Aunkst led Carnegie Mellon with 12 points and first-year Brit Phillips tallied 10, while sophomore forward Jennifer Larsen scored nine points and pulled down six rebounds.
On Sunday, Jan. 24, Carnegie Mellon lost a close game against the third-ranked Wash. U., 57–64. Aunkst tied the school record with a tally of six three-point shots, adding to her career-high 24 points. First-year forward Emily Peel added 11 points, and fifth-year senior Rachelle Roll grabbed 15 rebounds for her season high. Despite the loss, Roll commented that “the team morale is up after our hard-fought game against Washington University. Seeing that we can compete and have the ability to beat the number-three team in the country is extremely promising, and we just need to work on our consistency and get better every day.”
The Tartans dropped a 62–78 setback at NYU on Friday. Though the Violets led by as much as 20 points in the first half, Peel scored eight straight points to help the Tartans cut the lead to 23–36 by halftime. Out of the halftime break, Carnegie Mellon pulled within 10 points (51–41) with 11:23 left in the game, but was never able to make any more headway as the Violets went on a 12–0 run and ended the game up 16, 62–78.
On Sunday, Carnegie Mellon travelled to Brandeis. Both teams were streaky, but the Tartans lost in a competitive 58–70 decision. The squad jumped out to a quick 7–6 lead before Brandeis answered with nine points to make the score 7–15 with 13 minutes left in the first half. 
The Tartans responded with a run of their own and narrowed the lead to 13–15. Roll accounted for four of Carnegie Mellon’s points during the streak. 
By halftime, Brandeis held a seven-point lead over the Tartans, 30–33. Peel led Carnegie Mellon with eight first-half points.
Brandeis went on a three-minute, 7–2 run to start the new half and took a 32–40 lead. The Tartans answered with six points, cutting the score to 38–40. With 7:33 left in the game, Roll assisted sophomore guard Nicole Vaccarella in a backdoor lay-up to make the score 49–52. Brandeis then scored the next nine points to extend the lead to 49–61. 
The Tartans went on their final run, making the score 54–61. However, the effort was fruitless as Brandeis took the game, 58–70. Aunkst scored 11 points, while Roll, Vaccarella, and Larsen scored 10. Roll also grabbed nine rebounds.
The Tartans’ next game is at 6 p.m. on Friday as they take on NYU at home in Skibo Gym.

If one were to walk by the tennis courts at any time of day, one would see students and faculty alike engaging in friendly competition with their friends. Now those tennis enthusiasts can have one more reason to love the sport: the beginning of the Tennis On Campus program. According to the national organization’s press release, the Tennis On Campus program is “offered on over 500 college campuses with over 30,000 participating students” and will allow players from Carnegie Mellon to compete against other teams from across the country. The United States Tennis Association (USTA) — which helps regulate all things tennis-related, from local tournaments to the U.S. Open — has now brought Carnegie Mellon into the fold with its new program.
The main objective of the program is to organize non-varsity tennis players to compete in dual matches and travel to schools such as Penn State, Drexel, and Bucknell. “[Carnegie Mellon’s] tennis program overall is very strong, so there are a lot of great players ... who aren’t on a varsity team but still enjoy playing at a slightly more than recreational level,” said Jennifer Marlow, a Ph.D. student and a captain and event organizer for the Tennis Club. For each dual match, the 10-person coed team will play a total of five matches: men’s singles and doubles, women’s singles and doubles, and a mixed doubles match to round out the play.
“We’d like to establish CMU as a competitive force in the club tennis community,” Marlow said. “As the team continues to grow, we hope to increase awareness and participation among interested players at CMU, and to have fun while doing so.”
Sophomore Wei Guo, the other captain and event organizer for the Tennis Club, added, “We just started participating last year, so we are happy with the turnout. We felt like we formed a good team to be competitive, and we had some good matches against Pitt and Duquesne. We feel we can compete for the title.”
If Carnegie Mellon’s team does exceptionally well this year, it has the chance to qualify for the USTA National Campus Championship, which will be held in April in Surprise, Ariz.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track and field teams were in an Ohio state of mind the past two weekends. On Jan. 23, they traveled to Granville to compete in Denison University’s Lid-Lifter Invitational before traveling to Cleveland to take on Case Western Reserve University in a Jan. 30 dual meet. Both teams had much success at the Denison invitational before falling to Case, 63–64 on the men’s side and 40–86 on the women’s.
Seven men won events for the Tartans at Denison, highlighted by senior James Hulley’s 16.12-meter performance in the shot put. The distance is 0.58 meters farther than the NCAA Division III provisional qualifying distance and gives Hulley a very good shot to make the NCAA Championships. The performance also garnered Hulley his second straight UAA Athlete of the Week award.
“So far I have been happy with my performance this season,” Hulley said. “I’ve provisionally qualified for the NCAA Indoor National Championships already in shot put and will probably make it with my distance. Last indoor season, I qualified in the second-to-last meet, and it was very stressful leading up to finally throwing it that far. Being there already, I feel much more relaxed in my training and competitions, and I think that will ultimately lead to success at the national level, whereas last year I choked.”
In other field events, juniors Pat O’Brien and Mike Tomovich each cleared a height of 1.83 meters in the high jump, with O’Brien ulitmately being awarded first place on a judges’ decision. O’Brien also took second in the 55-meter hurdles with a time of 8.46 seconds. Winners for the Tartans in the running events included first-year Noel Titus (200-meter, 23.28), sophomore Rob Morhard (800-meter, 2:00.60), and juniors Dustin Musselman (400-meter, 52.99), Nate Bussiere (one mile, 4:24.88), and J.P. Allera (3000-meter, 9:08.73). The men’s team also dominated the 4x400-meter relay, with their A, B, and C teams taking the top three spots and their A team (O’Brien, first-year Daniel Ching, Titus, and Musselman) finishing almost 15 seconds (3:36.90) ahead of fourth-place Washington and Jefferson.
The women also managed seven victories at the Lid-Lifter, with multiple victories from sophomore Ivana Moses and senior Diane Mattingly. Moses crossed in eight seconds flat to win the 55-meter dash, 0.24 seconds ahead of senior teammate Timi Abimbola, who finished third. Moses’ distance of 4.94 meters in the long jump and 10.10 meters in the triple jump were also good enough to win. Mattingly was able to take first in both the 200-meter and 400-meter dashes with times of 28.76 and 1:02.68. Junior teammate Courtney Baker crossed fifth in the 200-meter, only 0.81 seconds behind Mattingly, but was victorious in the 800-meter run with a time of 2:22.51. First-year Emily Wobb rounded out the individual victories for the Tartans by completing the 3000-meter run in 11:08.93, over 45 seconds ahead of the second-place finisher. Mattingly, Moses, and Baker were also part of the Tartans’ first-place 4x200-meter relay, joined by senior Crystal LeePow.
Against Case, the women couldn’t replicate their success despite some better individual performances. Moses’ time of 7.90 seconds in the 55-meter dash was good enough for fourth behind junior teammate Kim Nederlof (3rd, 7.78) and two Case competitors. Mattingly clocked in the Tartans’ only individual running victory of the day with a time of 1:03.18 in the 400-meter dash, and was also part of the winning 4x400-meter relay team. Moses and sophomore Luci Laffitte were able to one-two the long jump (4.98 and 4.89 meters, respectively), and Moses and junior Melissa Hwang took top two in the triple jump (10.4 and 9.92 meters), but it was not enough to overcome the deficit, as Case took the top two places in several events and took top four in the 500-meter.
“Although it was only our second meet of the season, this was a very competitive meet for us because we’re going up against another team in our UAA conference,” said Abimbola, who took fourth in the 20-meter dash. “This was the second annual ‘Steel Town Showdown,’ as Case Western likes to call it, and we were pumped to go head to head with them and push ourselves. We would have all liked to win, but we also realized that this was only our second meet and that we would try our best.”
Abimbola then added, “Case Western can have the trophy this year, but they shouldn’t be fooled because we still have a long way to go.”
Despite winning nine of 15 events, the men ultimately fell short as Case made sure to stay close behind their competitors, only allowing the Tartans to one-two an event twice. The Tartans did the same to their foes for the most part, but Case was able to take the top four spots in the 80-meter to run up the points on their side. Titus and Musselman once again took the 20-meter (23.75) and 40-meter (51.74), respectively, while Bussiere took the mile and Allera won the 500-meter. Hulley continued to dominate the shot put with a winning distance of 15.34 meters; he took second to senior teammate Chris Fornataro in the weight throw.
Despite the team’s loss, Hulley echoed Abimbola’s sentiments that the focus is more on individual performance. “For the entire year except for UAA’s at the end of the season, there is no importance to team scoring.... Most of the year is focused on developing individually in competitions so that when the UAA meet rolls around, you are able to go out there and compete hard with your team in a meet where place is everything and it’s all about the team. I take a great deal of pride performing well when my team is really counting on it.”
Both teams will head back to Ohio for the fourth straight weekend to compete this Saturday at Mount Union College.

The Carnegie Mellon swimming and diving team traveled to New Wilmington, Pa. on Jan. 23 for a dual meet with Westminster College. Both the Tartan men and women won the meet, with scores of 183–113 and 181–110, respectively. The Tartans then came home to host Denison University this past Saturday for their last home meet of the season. They fell 80–217 on the women’s side, while the men’s team lost 164–135.
The women’s team started out the meet well with the relay team of junior Molly Evans, first-year Dorothy Yu, sophomore Hannah Gonzalez, and senior Sara Andrews winning the 400-yard medley relay with a time of 4:05.68. Individual highlights for the women’s team were Evans, who won the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1:58.12, and Andrews, who touched in second at 1:59.39. Evans also won the 200-yard backstroke with a time of 2:11.98 and the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 5:07.45, and sophomore diver Olivia DeFazio won both boards, with scores of 194.55 in the one-meter and 193.35 points for the three-meter.
For the men, fifth-year Jon Spring led the team by winning the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1:47.34 and the 500-yard freestyle in 4:52.84. First-year Daniel Glaser-Garbrick was a mere 0.45 seconds off the pool record for the 400-yard individual medley with his winning time of 4:11.69. Senior Jonas Altman-Kurosaki took first in the 1000-yard freestyle with a time of 9:52.65, while junior Michael Panzitta just touched out Glaser-Garbrick for the win in the 100-yard backstroke with a time of 54.40. To end the meet, the team of seniors Jeff Dahlen and Scott Moorby, junior Josh Matthews, and sophomore Matt Stanton won the 200-yard freestyle relay with a 1:29.07. 
Sophomore Mike Alexovich won the one-meter diving while senior Matt Kuhn won the three-meter event with a score of 225.65. Both Spring and Evans garnered UAA Athlete of the Week honors for their performances.
Saturday marked the final home meet for the Tartan seniors as they took on Denison. Before the meet started, the team took a moment to recognize Altman-Kurosaki, Dahlen, Jason Huber, Kuhn, Moorby, Spring, Gates Winkler, Andrews, and senior Christine Anderson for their contributions to the team over their careers.
At the start of the meet, the women’s team placed third in the 200-yard medley relay with a team of Yu, Andrews, Evans, and Burton. Stillo, sophomore Victoria Adams, and Evans each had season-best swims, as Stillo took second in the 100-yard breaststroke with a time of 1:08.22, Adams’ season-best 10:48.64 in her 1000-yard freestyle got second place, and Evans’ 500-yard freestyle time of 5:01.36 was also a season best.
“I think this weekend we swam really well,” Evans said. “Although Denison is a strong team, we were able to challenge them in a lot of races. Despite the fact that both teams lost, I think we had some outstanding in-season swims on both sides and really got up to race Denison for our last home meet.”
For the men, Altman-Kurosaki won the 1000-yard freestyle in a time of 9:46.52. Spring ended his home career with a bang, breaking the 10-minute barrier for the first time as he touched third in 9:57.57. 
“I was really happy with how the senior meet went, even if it was a loss,” Spring said. “We had some great swims and are posed to do well at our taper meets in the coming weeks.”
For the remaining events, Dahlen touched in second in the 200-yard backstroke with a time of 1:56.46 and Huber placed second in the 100-yard breaststroke in 1:00.32. Glaser-Garbrick dominated both the 200- and 100-yard butterfly with times of 1:54.52 and 51.73, respectively. Yee touched second in both the 200-yard free and fly before sprinting the last four laps of his 500-yard freestyle to seal a comeback victory.
“I’m really going to miss the whole team,” Huber said after the meet. “I feel like a father to these kids. I know that we are being smiled upon and have been blessed to finish out this season with a bang.”
Yee couldn’t help but echo Huber’s sentiments. “It’s definitely not going to be the same next year without these guys,” he said with watery eyes. “This team feels like my family, and it’s tough thinking about not having our eldest mentors with us next year.”
The Tartans will face off at the University of Pittsburgh on Saturday before heading to Atlanta for the University Athletic Association Championships on Thursday.

With a solid season in the making, the men’s swimming and diving team has had a strong performance from its members so far this year. Currently holding a record of 7–3, the Tartans have one last meet at the University of Pittsburgh next weekend before the conference and national championship competition begins. Last semester, junior Alex Hanson was named the University Athletic Association (UAA) Men’s Swimming Athlete of the Week and has been contributing to the team’s success ever since. Hanson has been a contender at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Championship meet the past two years and hopes to return again this year and perform well enough to place in the top 16.
When he is out of the water and not trying to break 4:00 in the 400-yard IM, Hanson is majoring in mechanical engineering. He notes that while his interest in coming to Carnegie Mellon was mainly for its top-10 academics, a college with a swim team was essential to his decision about where to go for college. Hanson finds a good balance between his full schedule of course work, practices, and swim meets. Hanson shared, “Swimming is a great stress reliever. There’s nothing like a hard practice to help you forget about failing a test. Although swimming takes up a large portion of my day, it has always helped me focus out of the pool.”
Hanson started swimming in a local swim club back home in Minnesota at the age of seven at the suggestion of his swim lesson instructor. Luckily for the Tartans, he decided to stick with it. An interesting side note is that Hanson’s favorite food to eat post-swim meet is ice cream: “...it’s a great source of carbohydrates, protein, and fat — swimmers need their calories.” Hanson looks to keep training hard and improving his times, and seems to be right at home at Carnegie Mellon as both a student and an athlete.

Even if your résumé is a meticulously crafted piece of art detailing an unbroken chain of accomplishments, most potential employers ultimately rely on interviews to confirm that you are as impressive as the résumé states. 
“The purpose of the résumé is to get the interview. The purpose of the interview is to get the job,” said Lisa Dickter, associate director in the Career Center.
After the Employment Opportunities Conference on Thursday, many students will be invited to interviews with potential employers.
Here is some advice on what to do and what not to do during these interviews and how to make the interviews turn out for the best.
Make good first and last impressions
This is true for almost any social interaction or relationship. 
“The beginning and ending of an interview is when a recruiter decides whether or not they think personally the student is [a] good fit for the company.... [The recruiters decide whether the student is] a pleasant person to be in that particular culture,” said Claudia Kirkpatrick, associate teaching professor at the Tepper School of Business. 
Compared to the other parts of an interview, making good first and last impressions is relatively easy. 
A big smile, a firm handshake, and good posture are usually enough.
Match the tone
In almost any social interaction, how one speaks is at least as important as what one says. Interviews can be tricky, though, because they can range from highly formal and structured to very casual and relaxed, depending on the company and position. 
“Assume it’s formal, but then take the lead from the interviewer,” Dickter advised. “But no matter how informal the recruiter, keep a level of professionalism. You don’t ever want to feel that they are your buddy.” Kirkpatrick also added, “If the recruiter asks the student why they are interested in a certain company, and the recruiter is being very formal and very stiff, the student would want to be very explicit about the job requirements as they were posted.... However, if the recruiter is very relaxed ... then the student has the opportunity to be more creative, but also remembering at the same time to talk about things relevant to the company.”
Stay positive
It is important to maintain a positive outlook during the interview. Never speak negatively about anything during the interview. You cannot throw mud without first getting your own hands dirty, and in this job market, you probably can’t afford to be anything but spotless. “[Employers] don’t want to hear outrage. They don’t want to hear anger and that you couldn’t deal with it,” Dickter said. “An employer will start to think the student is a negative person that will be critical of other people when they are actually on the job.”
Know yourself
The employer probably already read your résumé, but the employer will also expect you to be able to articulate why you feel your accomplishments are noteworthy. 
“[Students] need to know their strengths and their skills, and they need to be able to confidently explain each of their experiences in an organized way,” Dickter said. 
“Students need to weave into their answers to the employers’ questions ... their strengths and skills.” Kirkpatrick emphasized that students should be aware of how their accomplishments were useful and added value. “A résumé will state what the student did, but the interviewer will want to know more about what difference that made and what results are still there,” she said.
Know the company
“At the very least you need to know what they do, what they make, who their clients are, and why they exist,” Dickter said. It really is just common courtesy,  since the employer probably also took the time to read your résumé. Dickter advised that a short visit to the company’s website should be sufficient.
Be enthusiastic about the job
Don’t just pretend to show enthusiasm. Actually be enthusiastic, because it is a rare and exclusive honor that you are even being considered for a position at all. 
As Kirkpatrick advised, “One of the things that any student going [through] the interview process should remember is that if they take the job, he or she will do it passionately.” She also added that it is important not to have pre-conceived notions about any job. “A student should not pre-judge whether or not he or she will take the job until the company offers it,” Kirkpatrick said.

Job fairs have been the beginning of great careers for many Carnegie Mellon students. In this article, students share tips on how to use job fairs to your advantage and get that dream job.
Kyla Dolan, a sophomore computer science major, got her summer internship from the 2009 Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC).
“When talking to my adviser about summer internships, he recommended that I apply for the Google Bold Practicum program. So I went to their table at the TOC,” she said.
Dolan said that this interaction was the first step in a process that involved two technical phone interviews before she was offered a position in the program. Dolan said her résumé was one of the most important parts of the process that allowed her to stand out.
“Don’t underestimate the importance of your résumé. It’s what the employers will bring with them from the job fair that’s all about you,” she said.
Shane Rife, a junior civil engineering major, secured a position working with the federal government through the 2008 TOC. Last summer, Rife was a civil engineering intern at Aberdeen Testing Center (ATC), a Department of Defense automotive and direct fire testing center in eastern Maryland. 
This position allowed him to see how much he wanted to work with the government. While at the TOC, however, Rife kept his options open.
“I talked to the companies that seemed interesting, regardless of whether they were a typical civil engineering company. I was one of the only civil engineering interns at ATC,” he said.
Rife said that the process of getting a government internship and obtaining the necessary security clearance was grueling, but that it was well worth it since he is now prepared to look for other government jobs.
“Be yourself, not the person you think they are looking for,” he said.
For Lauren Taglieri, a senior information systems major, the TOC and Business Opportunities Conference have been the start to both her most recent summer internship and post-graduation job, respectively. Last summer, she worked with the Society of Research Administrators in information technology, and this summer, she will begin her job at Deloitte in Washington, D.C.
“I tried to ask as many questions about the company as I could in the few minutes I had at the booth, and then just got all the handouts they had,” she said.
Taglieri then went home to review her information and to research the companies online before looking for interviews and information sessions on TartanTrak.
“Generally I think it’s good to know what companies will be at the fair and do some background research before it starts. That way you can target the companies you are interested in and not be overwhelmed,” she said.
“Having a good, organized résumé and being excited about learning about the company helps too.”
Rachel Cawley, a December 2009 graduate of the master’s in information systems management program at the Heinz School and a May 2009 graduate from the electrical and computer engineering department, got her dream job from an encounter that began at last fall’s TOC. 
Cawley will soon begin work with Raytheon, a company specializing in defense technology and training, homeland and border security, and cybersecurity at its office in Boston.
Cawley made a list of companies she wanted to talk to before the fair, then went to each one, introducing herself and asking about the opportunities available. At each company, Cawley asked for a business card and about the next steps necessary.
“The next day, I would always e-mail them to remind them of what we talked about and thank them for their time,” Cawley said.
Cawley estimated that almost 90 percent of her internships, jobs, and interviews have originated with encounters at the TOC.
“My suggestion is to start with a company that you don’t care about as much as a practice. That way you can warm up, and you might even end up liking that company anyway,” Cawley said.

With the Employment Opportunities Conference (EOC) taking place this week, getting a full-time job or internship is one of the first things on many students’ minds. 
Although they might be nervous about finding a job that they really enjoy, they do have many successful alumni to look to for advice on their job search. These alumni can be a great resource and their stories can provide both encouragement and support to the students.
Bryan Iams, now head of external communications for Bayer Corporation, which has its U.S. headquarters here in Pittsburgh, is one such story of success after graduation from Carnegie Mellon. 
While Iams was working at Bayer, he was also taking night classes at the Heinz School, studying public policy and management, which resulted in his attaining his master’s degree in public management in 2004. Though he is currently an employee of Bayer, Iams’ first job was with the global public relations agency Burson-Marsteller, also in Pittsburgh. While there, he worked as part of the firm’s public relations practice.
Iams explained that he “provided media relations support and counsel to a wide range of consumer and business-to-business clients” while working at Burson-Marsteller.
After leaving the firm, Iams went to Bayer to gain experience in a different side of the public relations field. At Bayer, Iams is responsible for serving as the company spokesperson and managing corporate media relations, public affairs, advertising, and online media.
“I left Burson and joined Bayer to gain experience on the corporate side of the communications and public affairs business,” Iams said.
Iams also attributes his time spent in the Heinz program to aiding him in his career’s success. “I was impressed with the caliber of professors at the Heinz School. They brought a real-world insight to the classroom, which provided the students with a hands-on look at many of the challenges and opportunities that we would face upon graduation,” he said. 
Moreover, Iams believes that it was the other students of the master’s program that helped him to benefit further.
“The Heinz School’s diversity — people and thinking — made the experience extremely valuable.” Iams also valued the experience of being able to meet a wide variety of people from different backgrounds. “In many cases, my classmates were from all parts of the world, and this provided a true global perspective to the graduate program,” Iams stated.
Iams believes that other students looking for an internship or job can be just as successful as he was. He advises students to focus their job search on areas that they are specifically interested in, and that students try to keep long-term career goals in mind in addition to short-term ones.
“My advice is simple. Don’t settle for just any internship or job as possible. Look and then apply for internships or jobs that will provide growth in your particular field of interest.” Iams also stressed the importance of thinking toward the future and focusing on long-term goals rather than short-term goals. “Be patient with your career and take a longer-term approach to your goals. If you focus on doing great work in your field, everything else will take care of itself over time,” Iams said.

With hordes of students pushing their way through a maze of potential recruiters, job fairs can be overwhelming. The Employment Opportunities Conference (EOC) has 137 registered companies and is spread out across two rooms — Wiegand Gym and Rangos Hall. In order to make this seemingly daunting task of navigating through the job fair while simultaneously making a good impression on the recruiters seem easier, the Carnegie Mellon Career Center presented a seminar on how to be successful at a job fair. Presented by Sonjala Williams, assistant director at the Carnegie Mellon Career Center, the seminar provided tips on what students should do to prepare for the job fair, how they should approach recruiters during the fair, and what steps they should take after the fair is over.
Preparing for the job fair 
“Preparation is key to success,” Williams said. She added that the first priority of the students should be to develop a “clean, concise, error-free résumé.”
 Students can also seek help from the career center regarding their résumés and have their résumés approved by a Career Center adviser. It is also important to carry multiple copies of their résumé to the job fair.
The next important point that Williams mentioned is to research the companies that you want to approach at the job fair. As Williams said, the students should have “enough information [about the companies] to have an intelligent conversation” with recruiters. Another useful tip is to write down a few questions about the company to ask the representatives. Williams also added that students should rank the companies according to their preferences. She compared the ranking process to the ranking process while applying to universities. “Like college,” Williams said, “[you should have your] top priorities and safeties.” A student should know what each specific company is looking for and why they are the right fit for the company. Students should also know how to project themselves to the recruiters and make sure that the recruiters realize the value of the student. 
As Williams said, you should know how to “sell yourself.” Williams recommended that the students prepare a “30–to–60 second commercial” about themselves. This statement should include what type of internships the student is looking for and why they are a good candidate.
Lastly, it is important to dress properly for the fair. Williams said that a general rule of thumb during interviews was to “dress two notches above what the interviewers would wear.” 
For the EOC, the safest dress code would be business professional. The career center has a closet full of clean, donated business suits that students who do not have suits can use. 
Williams also cautioned students not to “overdo it” while dressing for the fair. Excessive makeup or perfume could turn the recruiters away rather than impress them.
What to do at the job fair 
Although many students might be coming to the job fair after or before classes, they should avoid carrying coats or bags into the fair. 
Coats and bags not only weigh one down while walking through two levels of booths, but are also awkward to handle while talking to recruiters. 
A simple folder with multiple résumés and a pen is all one should carry. Williams added that before entering the fair, it is important to look at a copy of the map of the booth setup and know which booths to approach first. 
Using the first half-hour or so to take a quick look around the fair is also a good idea. After getting a general feel for the fair, one should start approaching the top companies. 
When approaching a booth, never go in a group. Students have to show recruiters that they are unique, and going together in a group defies this purpose. 
While talking to recruiters, Williams advised students to “be conversational and confident.” Non-verbal cues are as important as verbal ones. “Make sure you’re exhibiting good body language,” Williams added. 
A useful tip that Williams gave was to write something specific about your conversation with the recruiter on the back of your résumé before handing it to them. This will help the recruiters identify your résumé from among the tons of résumés that they receive. Williams also added that students should never be arrogant while talking to the companies. 
The worst attitude to have is that “I’m great, they should want me, I’m CMU.” Humility and politeness matter as much as having excellent credentials. Williams asked the students to not simply go around and collect all the freebies. This not only bogs down the students, but also creates a negative impression of them. Lastly, Williams advised students to collect as many business cards as they can. These will be useful in contacting the recruiters in the future.
What to do after the fair is over 
Sadly, the work does not stop once the fair is over; it only increases. Williams reiterated the importance of following up with companies. Sending thank-you notes to all the companies you talked to is a must. Williams added that the notes should be sent 24 to 48 hours after the job fair and could be e-mails or even paper letters. 
She explained the importance of taking notes during the fair so that the students can write something specific about the conversation they had with the recruiters in the letter.
Following up with the companies to make sure that they know you are interested in the position is crucial. Williams stressed that students should not be shy while trying to contact the companies. 
Williams said that “you have the right to follow up” and ask the companies whether the position is still open. It is also great to follow up by sending the company resume updates or additions to one’s portfolio. Williams concluded the seminar by telling the students that at the job fair, they are all ambassadors of Carnegie Mellon University. “If [the recruiters] come and have a great experience here, they will want to come back again,” Williams said.

A common fixture in any college dorm room is the overflowing power strip, with wires stretching across the room to power laptops, TVs, microwaves, and mini-fridges. This unavoidable disarray is common enough to be tolerated, but eliminating the need for wires is a thought that has probably crossed the minds of many individuals. With current research in this field, however, this may become a reality in upcoming years.
Wireless electricity is based off a concept known as resonant energy transfer, introduced around 100 years ago by Nikola Tesla. At TEDGlobal 2009, WiTricity CEO Eric Giler explained that a wire coil, called the power source coil, uses electricity to resonate at a very high frequency. The energy from the coil’s resonance can then cause another coil to resonate without having to physically touch the original coil. The second coil is the power capture coil, which is made to resonate only at the same frequency as the power source coil. If the two coils are placed close enough, the power source coil will cause the power capture coil to resonate, and magnetic energy will transfer between them. This is the basis of wireless electricity transfer.
“The power source converts the electricity into an oscillating magnetic field, and the magnetic field carries the energy from point A to point B, and at point B it’s converted from a magnetic field back into electricity,” explained David Schatz, director of business development and marketing at WiTricity.
Scientists at WiTricity state that wireless energy transfer will provide more than just convenience and better organization.
Many electronic devices today are powered by disposable batteries, which are detrimental to the environment, cost-ineffective, and inefficient compared to many other sources of power, according to Giler. In addition, batteries are often used around power sources. “By building an electricity power source into one of these heavy devices [like a computer] that’s around and happens to be plugged in, you can then use it in devices that are always used nearby [like an iPod or cell phone],” Schatz said, “and thus they don’t even need to have a battery.”
WiTricity, a company founded in 2007, is hoping to revolutionize the way electronics may be powered in the future. The name WiTricity comes from “wireless” and “electricity,” which is a perfect description for their research. Currently, the company is developing a method to safely power electronics without using wires. Other companies are working on different forms of wireless electricity, like WiPower, which hopes to be able to charge devices wirelessly using a charging pad.
It may be shocking to think that power cords will someday be a thing of the past, but it has already been proven that this technology is functional. 
Just recently, working with electronics manufacturer Haier, WiTricity showcased their product at the 2010 Consumer Electronics Show by powering a 32-inch TV set completely without wires, according to a report from www.SFGate.com.
While this revolutionary technology is enticing, roadblocks do exist in its distribution. “It takes a while to convince companies to adopt something as radically new and different as this, because they have to change their products to incorporate it,” Schatz said. “And we have to take the technology and develop it from some sort of laboratory scientific experiment to something that can be produced in the factory.” 
It will take more improvement before wireless electricity devices will be able to be produced efficiently and cost-effectively. In addition, there is a range limitation for powering devices. Schatz realizes that some devices will eventually need to move away from power sources. “What we’ll be able to do with those products is to be able to allow them to charge without having to be plugged in. In some cases you can directly power things if they happen to be always used in proximity to a source, and in other cases you can usually charge the devices when they’re in proximity to the source,” he said. In short, wireless electricity can be used to directly power larger appliances that are not mobile, like desktop computers, and can also be used to charge devices that can be taken anywhere, like cell phones.
Despite the current limitations, we can expect to see this technology being implemented in the very near future. Schatz said that while the technology “is more of a conceptual design, in 2010 the very first of our products will be shipped to customers in commercial and military applications. In the end of 2010 and early 2011, it will start to be shipped in some consumer electronics applications.”

When Dan Wooley was trapped under the rubble of the Hotel Montana in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, he had just about given up hope of survival.
With the millions affected by the earthquake, it would probably take several days for someone to find him in the ruins. Wooley was fighting more than hunger, thirst, and exhaustion — he had to endure the cuts and bruises caused by the wreckage. While Wooley didn’t have a surgeon on standby, he did have what now seems to be the next best thing: his iPhone. It is no surprise that iPhones have the capability to provide an incredibly vast expanse of information because the apps (one of the signature features of the iPhone) allow one to find any kind of specific knowledge instantly.
“I had an app that had pre-downloaded all this information about treating wounds. So I looked up excessive bleeding and I looked up compound fracture,” Wooley told CNN News. Forced to be resourceful, he ripped off his shirt, wrapped it around his leg as a bandage, and then used his belt as a makeshift tourniquet. To stop the bleeding on his head, he rolled up one of his socks and pressed against it.
The life-saving app is called “Pocket First Aid & CPR” and is filled with information provided by the American Heart Association. Wooley said that the AHA’s affiliation allowed him to feel confident in the information he read. Another suggestion he took from the app was not to fall asleep, as he thought he might have suffered from shock. In response to that, Wooley set his phone’s alarm to go off every 20 minutes. When his battery power eventually drained, he had no choice but to turn his phone off. However, Wooley became so accustomed to the habitually persistent alarms that he claims he literally “had trained his body not to sleep for long periods, drifting off only to wake up within minutes.”
The self-treatment Wooley performed was undoubtedly a great help, but he could not avoid the possibility of not making it out from under the rubble. Fearing the worst was close at hand, he turned to one of the other resources with him: his journal. Shedding tears and dripping blood, Dan Wooley wrote his final good-bye to his family from under a collapsed hotel. “I was in a big accident, an earthquake. Don’t be upset at God. He always provides for his children, even in hard times. I’m still praying that God will get me out, but he may not. But even so he will always take care of you,” Wooley wrote.
But Wooley didn’t need to say goodbye; he was rescued 60 hours after the building’s collapse. However, during those two and a half days of being trapped, he went through a roller coaster of emotions. Sometimes there were rescuers talking to those trapped, but other times he and other victims waited in silence for hours on end, never knowing if they would survive until their saviors came. Eventually, though, a crew came to pull the trapped locals from the rubble to safety. Wooley, looking back, gives thanks to God, but credit is also due to that little app on his iPhone that allowed him to help save himself.
Today, the iPhone, which is equipped with its many diverse apps, has become more than just a cell phone. Many apps have been programmed for the iPhone that assist with medical emergencies. Airstrip OB is a childbirth app that sends a patient’s vitals to their obstetrician. Another app, called CPR & Choking, allows users to determine if others have life-threatening conditions, and if they require emergency medical care. Emergency Radio can allow the iPhone to tune into emergency radio frequencies, which would be useful in any public emergency situation. There are even apps developed for first aid for pets — nothing is left out when it comes to iPhone apps.

A plasma TV has a wide screen exactly like a conventional television set, but one major difference from the hulking “big box” is that its thickness is only six inches. So much is managed in such a small space because a plasma display illuminates small, colored fluorescent lights to form an image, whereas old television sets use a cathode ray tube (CRT) to form the same image. A CRT is very bulky, and if the screen width has to be increased in a CRT television, the length of the CRT also has to be increased. However, the fluorescent lights used in a plasma display occupy very little space and also result in a very high-quality display, unlike CRT television sets.
Three types of fluorescent lights — red, blue, and green — constitute a pixel. The intensity of the different lights is varied by the plasma to obtain a vast range of colors as observed on a colored television screen. Plasma, as explained by www.plasmatvscience.org, is the core element in a fluorescent light. It is a gas that contains free-flowing ions and electrons. Unlike normal conditions in which gases have uncharged particles, plasma does not have a net charge of zero because of the presence of charged particles like ions and electrons. When free electrons are introduced in a gas along with an electrical voltage, the atoms collide with the free electrons. Consequently, other electrons are knocked loose. When an electron is knocked out, an atom becomes unbalanced and acquires a net positive charge; this is called a positively charged ion.
As electrical current runs through plasma, the principle of “opposite poles attract each other” applies. The positively charged particles rush toward the negatively charged area of the plasma, whereas the negatively charged particles are attracted by the positively charged area. During this great surge, particles keep on colliding with each other. As a result, the gas atoms present in the plasma get excited and photons of energy are released. The gas atoms are present in thousands of individual cells placed between two plates of glass. The atoms used in plasma screen displays are xenon and neon atoms that release light photons upon excitation. The light photons released have a wavelength that falls within the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and thus they are invisible to humans. 
But these ultraviolet light photons help excite visible light photons from other atoms, which are visible to the human eye. These ultraviolet photons interact with the walls of the cells, which are coated with phosphor. Phosphors are materials that emit light when exposed to the ultraviolet photons. As soon as an ultraviolet light photon collides with a phosphor atom present in the wall of the cell, the atom gets heated up because its electron excites to a higher energy level. A visible light photon is released when the electron falls back to its original energy level.
The different colors are obtained because each phosphor emits a different colored light. Every pixel observed on the screen is constituted by three separate cells, each having a red-, blue-, and green-colored phosphor. These three colors blend together with different intensities to create the pixel of a specific color. The intensities of each cell can be increased or decreased by controlling the pulse of current that flows through every cell. Hundreds of different combinations of red, blue, and green light can give rise to colors across the entire visible spectrum.
The plasma television is unique because the technology uses very thin materials to produce a wide screen. The image is bright and looks the same from every angle because every pixel is lit individually. The disadvantage of plasma televisions is that they are highly expensive. According to www.Buy.com, however, as technology has advanced and demand has increased the prices have also dropped; this can be seen by comparing the prices from 1998 (when the first one was sold for $8000) to the prices today, when they cost just around $700.

Fusion experiment has promising results
Recent results from the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California indicate that controlled fusion reactions may be within sight. A small-scale test of a hohlraum using a new technique of laser adjustment was 20 times the scale of previous experiments. Hohlraums are hollow cylinders that focus incident laser beams into an extremely small area, thus concentrating enormous amounts of energy.
Researchers have been experimenting with fusion reactors for decades, but they have not yet been able to create one capable of producing an efficient amount of energy. Such a reactor would provide a plentiful and relatively clean energy source for commercial and scientific applications. 
Nuclear fusion is the same way the sun produces its energy. If the scientists at the NIF are correct, an efficient reactor may be achieved before the end of the year. Even so, commercial reactors would still be many years away.

Gates Foundation donates $10 billion
In the largest charitable donation ever targeted at a specific goal, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced Friday that it was donating $10 billion to improve vaccination in developing and underdeveloped countries around the world. The specific goal of the foundation is reducing child mortality, with a target of immunizing 90 percent of children in the developing world. Such an effort will also require investment by many governments, according to Gates.
The Gates Foundation plan aims to save the lives of 7.6 million children by 2019. Many of these children require vaccines for diseases that are rare or easily treated in developed nations, such as tuberculosis and pneumonia. 
The introduction of a malaria vaccine in the next five years could help an additional 1.1 million children. However, as Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization, stated, “The Gates Foundation’s commitment to vaccines is unprecedented, but just a small part of what is needed.”

Evidence found for dinosaur skin color
An article published Wednesday in the journal Nature gives some of the first convincing evidence for an accurate skin coloring of dinosaurs. Research done by a team of British and Chinese scientists, led by Michael Benton of the University of Bristol, used a technique previously developed for bird feathers to infer the appearance of dinosaurs while alive.
The color of the dinosaurs was inferred from tiny feathers present in the fossils. These feathers contained melanosomes, which are small structures containing pigment present in squid ink and many animals. By reconstructing dinosaurs’ pigmentation, the research team concluded that this particular species of dinosaur, Sinosauropteryx, had an orange and white-striped tail.
Some paleontologists are still skeptical about the results, questioning whether dinosaurs without feathers also have melanosomes. They also criticize the small sample size, which consisted of only a few fossil remains.

If we see a metal fork on a table, we immediately recognize it as a fork. If we listen to our favorite song, we recognize the sounds as music. The ability to recognize environmental stimuli is something that comes naturally to us.
But some people can see the fork on the table, and knowing that it’s silvery, metal, and something we eat with, conclude it is a spoon. Or if they hear a song, they cannot understand that what they are hearing is music.
Both of these bizarre conditions can be attributed to a brain disorder called agnosia, which is a general term describing an inability to recognize anything from objects to sounds, although senses and memory are fully functional. As www.merck.com states, agnosia can be the result of brain damage or can be a birth defect. While the mechanics of perception are still unknown, the regions of the brain that are affected have been identified.
Generally, agnosia patients have damage to the temporal lobe of the brain, which is associated with sensory processing. The primary auditory complex, which is responsible for processing sounds, is located in the temporal lobe. In addition, the temporal lobe is involved in processing visual stimuli and language. Because of the versatility of the temporal lobe of the brain, damage to this region can cause many different varieties of agnosia.
According to www.psychnet-uk.com, the inability to recognize aspects of music is known as amusia; a mild and commonly known form is  tone deafness, with which individuals cannot tell the difference between different pitches. With apperceptive agnosia, patients cannot recognize objects, but they can describe them accurately. This kind of agnosia can be specific to certain kinds of objects, such as things that are living. Associative agnosia is similar. Patients can categorize objects, but cannot distinguish between objects. Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize faces — patients can no longer recognize friends or family. Other forms of agnosia have stranger symptoms. Some patients cannot distinguish between their own fingers; others can only recognize objects if they interact with them in a way other than sight, such as through touching or smelling.
According to www.ninds.nih.gov, there are no cures for agnosia, although patients can undergo therapy. For example, people with agnosia involving speech can be helped with speech therapy. However, research involving patients with agnosia can increase our knowledge of neurological pathways.Psychologists are still trying to understand the cognitive processes involved with external stimuli. By researching patients who do not have the full ability to manage their senses, we might be able to understand which parts of the brain are needed and why.

Bhangra in the Burgh, Carnegie Mellon University’s annual bhangra competition, had the entire campus community tapping to its beats last Saturday.
Courtesy of cmuTV.org.
Bhangra. Over the past three years, this word has created a special place for itself in the Carnegie Mellon lingo. To an outsider, bhangra — one of the most popular Indian dances — would entail brilliant colors, energy-packed performances, and wholesome entertainment. To the average Carnegie Mellon student, bhangra has come to mean all this and much more. Bhangra in the Burgh, Carnegie Mellon University’s annual bhangra competition, is the largest student-run event on campus and has transformed from just being a celebration of dance to a gathering of vibrant student life, an event that has the entire campus community tapping to its beats.
Considering the fact that the show was sold out, it seems clear that Bhangra in the Burgh has retained its popularity over the years. Like the previous two years’ competitions, Bhangra in the Burgh 3, held at Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall last Saturday, was enjoyable until the very end. As always, the organizational skill involved was phenomenal. The co-chairs for the event this year were Gurmukh Singh Chhabra, a junior chemical engineering major; Vishal Agrawal, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major; and Suraj Baxi, a sophomore social and decision sciences major. The event was planned to be bigger and better than those of the previous years. Chhabra explained that the university’s Pittsburgh chapter alumni meeting was happening the same weekend, “so we have 75 alumni coming and watching the show.” Chhabra said that this would be a great platform to promote the show and “showcase [to the alumni] what CMU has to offer and what bhangra really is.”
According to Agrawal, handling the entire event was both “an honor and responsibility.” The event was all the more honorable as all the proceeds from the event were donated to the Children’s Home of Pittsburgh. The fact that it is a charitable event makes Bhangra in the Burgh stand out. “There are a lot of Bhangra competitions all over the nation that are done by professional companies, and all the profits are kept by them,” Chhabra said. “[We wanted to] give back to the community and carry forward the goal of the 2007 co-chairs and put Pittsburgh on the map.”
By drawing in teams from all over the nation, the competition has certainly made Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon well known names in the realm of bhangra. This year, the competition boasted eight competing bhangra teams: Rutgers Bhangra, Cornell Bhangra, Drexel University Bhangra, UVA di Shaan, George Mason University Bhangra, Michigan Bhangra team, DC Bhangra Crew, and VCU Bhangra.
To appeal to a wider portion of the campus population, a number of exhibition acts were included in the program. These acts consisted of performances by Carnegie Mellon groups including the dance troupes Tanah, Chak De, and SoulStylz, as well as a cappella groups Deewane and the Originals. Other exhibition acts included dance performances by the University of Pittsburgh’s Indian dance troupe, Pitt Raas, as well as Point Park University’s hip-hop group, Impulse.
To add to the entertainment quotient, stand-up comedians Rajiv Satyal and Monrok were invited as the MCs for the evening. From performing a hilarious rendition of one of Bollywood’s most famous dances to cracking witty jokes on the Indian community, the MCs ensured that the event was enjoyable for all.
The dances themselves were quite remarkable. Although each of the competing teams retained the basic flavors of the power-packed bhangra style, there was always at least one aspect of each performance that was unique to each team. Notable among these were the performances of DC Bhangra Crew, an all-women team that had a rather different, yet pleasing, style of choreography, and Cornell Bhangra, which spelled out the name of their university during the dance through the body postures of the dancers. George Mason University Bhangra and UVA di Shaan both made excellent use of dholaks, instruments similar to drums that add to the beats of the music. Their innovative techniques of experimenting with the music, and also their energetic performances, earned George Mason University Bhangra and UVA di Shaan the third and second prizes, respectively. The first prize went to returning champions VCU Bhangra, who, along with dancing flawlessly to the music, incorporated some Punjabi lines of speech into their act, adding to the rustic feeling of the performance.
The exhibition acts were also quite entertaining. One of the most enjoyable performances was by SoulStylz. The group integrated a number of different dance styles in their performance, including hip-hop and typical Bollywood dance. By choosing popular songs from Indian movies to dance to, SoulStylz had a large portion of the audience singing along. The University of Pittsburgh’s team performed traditional raas from the western part of India, as opposed to bhangra, which is a dance of the north. This different dance style helped showcase some of the variety that Indian culture has to offer. The event concluded with a performance by Carnegie Mellon’s very own bhangra team, Chak De. Chak De’s fast-paced dance and the overwhelming support and cheering they received from the audience created an excellent performance.
Although there were some minor technical problems with the sound system, the overall event was a great success. Compared to last year, there were very few issues with the seating in the hall. Agrawal said that this was a conscious effort, as the staff took extra care to ensure that it did not repeat the mistakes it had made before. However, the planning of the event was not without some major setbacks. One of the major issues the committee faced was that of sponsorship. “Most of our external sponsors backed out,” Chhabra said. However, despite this, the show managed to run smoothly.
For the co-chairs though, success would be determined by the satisfaction of the overwhelmingly large Bhangra in the Burgh staff. “I think the entire event would be a failure if the people who worked the event didn’t have a great time,” Baxi said.
In fact, as a tribute to the staff, the co-chairs put together a video of some of the special moments shared by the staff while preparing for the event and showcased it at the end of the program.
Baxi said spending time with the staff was one of the most enjoyable parts of coordinating the event. “[It was great] spending time with the committee and getting to know people who you would never know otherwise.” Agrawal agreed and said, “[The show is] a good way to network and to get to know the campus community.”
For a show that has used Indian culture to bring together a variety of people from all parts of the university, Bhangra in the Burgh has truly captured the spirit of a diverse community like Carnegie Mellon.

Ancient Japan and modern-day British private school life shared the stage this past weekend in the Carnegie Mellon University School of Music’s rendition of The Mikado. A Gilbert and Sullivan piece, this classic is a comedic love story, originally a parody of the ridiculous rules and customs of Victorian England as shown through the guise of Japan. Directed by Gregory Lehane, designed by  new head of the drama department Peter Cooke, and with the orchestra directed by Bob Page, The Mikado has been plucked out of feudal Japan and placed in the more modern-day setting of a British private school. Played by a dual cast, this new adaptation comes with many alterations and twists that allow audiences to relate the story to life in today’s world as well as to its Victorian origins.
As the overture begins, the stage is lit with dozens of paper lanterns hanging above the setting of a gymnasium, where students in uniform gather and mill about, socializing and leaning against lockers, portraying the typical social landscape of middle schools worldwide.
Soon, a lone trombonist enters, amid excited gossiping from the girls and derisive looks from the boys, and reveals himself to be the wandering musician Nanki-Poo, played by Ian McEuen and Ryan Townsend. Nanki-Poo and the schoolgirl Yum-Yum, played by juniors Asha Carroll and Kristen Hahn, are in love.
However, Yum-Yum is the ward and bride-to-be of the official Ko-Ko, played alternately by senior Scott Wasserman and senior Adam Hill, who has risen in worldly status to become the Lord High Executioner of the town Titipu, where the characters live. To assure everyone of the importance of his position, Ko-Ko informs the audience of all the people who “will not be missed” in the extremely entertaining and rather vindictive song “I’ve Got a Little List.” The updated version of this song has the audience in stitches over Ko-Ko’s choice of victims, such as “children who have cell phones and who text with them all day.” Ko-Ko was animated and hilarious, and his scenes with the many personas of Lord Pooh-Bah are equally entertaining.
The haughty lord Pooh-Bah, played by senior Hans Tashjian, who is able to trace his noble lineage back to a single-celled organism, arrives in Titipu and assumes the role of every important official available. Yum-Yum and her two friends tease the lord about his snooty manners in the comically mocking song “So Please You, Sir,” while Ko-Ko frets over his duty of beheading someone as the Lord High Executioner.
Nanki-Poo manages to have a moment alone with Yum-Yum, where he reveals his true identity as the son of the Mikado, the Emperor of Japan, played by senior Tim Ruff. He is forced to flee his position at the court after attracting the unwelcome attention of the noblewoman Katisha, played by seniors Melissa Johnson and Alexa Devlin.
When a flustered Ko-Ko threatens to end their love, Nanki-Poo decides he would rather end his own life than live without his love. However, Nanki-Poo’s imminent suicide inspires Ko-Ko to strike a deal with the young prince: If Nanki-Poo is allowed to marry Yum-Yum and live in happiness for a month, Ko-Ko will then be allowed to fulfill his official duty and cut off his head. Nanki-Poo readily agrees to this, but thanks to the skittishness of Ko-Ko, the interference of Poo-Bah, and the untimely arrival of Katisha and the Mikado himself, things turn out as planned.
Mixing paper lanterns with plaid skirts, and flowing kimonos with a giant portrait of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, The Mikado was a hilarious and engaging work that entertained new audiences and provided a modern twist for those familiar with this classic show, showcasing the talent and ingenuity of the students and their teachers. Her Majesty would be pleased.

Traveling in a foreign country is always a challenge, especially while studying abroad. Get some quick tips from this informal travel guide put together by two students who studied abroad at Imperial College London and had the opportunity to travel across Europe during their time there.
The informal guide to traveling abroad while studying abroad
Okay. You’re a student. You want to see a lot of places. You don’t have money. But don’t let that stop you — traveling in Europe can be super-cheap and easy. We’ll admit that it won’t be the most glamorous experience (“How many times have I worn this shirt? Only five? Okay, good to go.”), but we think it is the best way for students to travel.
Step 1: What to pack?
Versatile clothes for any weather (Learn to layer) 
Tennis shoes, sandals, or flats (No heels) 
Travel guide (a helpful reference; check out your local library for a free one) 
Toiletries (Shampoo can double as body wash) 
Backpack or tote bag (Buy convertible luggage)
Lock(s) (for luggage and locker) 
Camera (DSLR is nice, but sometimes a pain to take care of, so slip a cheap point-and-shoot in your pocket and try not to live out your memories behind the lens) 
Journal
Step 2: Planning
Go everywhere you possibly can! Really. Generally, allow at least four days in the really big cities. Sometimes you can stay for weeks and still feel like you missed things. Otherwise two to three days for smaller cities could do them plenty of justice.
Also try to plan around local holidays or festivals. This can either be really amazing — you get to see cool once-in-a-lifetime events — or it can suck — you’re surrounded by tourists in fanny packs, and everything will get more expensive.
Step 3: Getting there
So there’s this thing called EuroPass that allows you to travel all over Europe with just one card. There are some stipulations: You can only use it for a certain number of days in a short period. It’ll get you to places fast and it gives you freedom to go anywhere.
RyanAir, Aer Lingus, and EasyJet are the most popular “value” airlines, meaning super-cheap flights (some of ours were free plus $10 to $20 for taxes), but of course there are hidden costs. Most of these flights land in airports an hour or so away from the city, so prepare to arrange and pay for bus transportation. Try Terravision, EasyBus, or local bus services. Generally, the airport websites will have information to help you. Baggage weight and size is heavily restricted, especially with RyanAir, so follow the rules and don’t cheat the system. Keep in mind that these extra costs can add up, so even if your flight is cheap it might be worth the extra money to fly directly into the city.
Step 4: Finding a place to stay
Hostels are the way to go when on a budget (which you probably are). Save your money for fun stuff. We’re used to cramped dorms anyways — hostels are just like them.
Try to book a hostel at least a week in advance. Some people like the thrill of finding a hostel once they arrive; however, you’re likely to pay a lot more or end up in a crap-hole.
Good places to start for hostels: Hostelworld.com, Hostels.com, and Hostelbookers.com, all of which give great recommendations and reviews.
What constitutes a good hostel?
Location: The hostel should be located very near to public transportation (if available), or within walking distance to the things you want to see. 
Free breakfast: The majority of hostels offer free breakfast, mostly of the “toast, jam, and cereal” type. While this might not seem like much, that free sustenance starts a long day of adventuring off on the right foot. 
Lockers: Hopefully you didn’t pack too many valuables, but it’s nice to know that you’ll still have clothes when you come back.
Linen: Some super-stingy hostels require you to bring your own linen, so beware; others might ask you to rent. Usually they’re included.
Generally, hostels range from 11 to 20 euros ($15 to $28) a night, depending on the city and the day. You’ll pay extra for weekends or for staying in very touristy cities.
Step 5: Explore!
Everyone explores differently, but we’d like to suggest some tips:
Wander: Guidebooks are great, but nothing beats the feeling of stumbling onto treasure when you least expect it. Sure, you’ll get lost, but it is a great way to get to know the city. 
Food: Look for open markets because they’re amazing, (La Boquería in Barcelona, Borough Market in London, rue Mouffetard in Paris) and look for dinner specials. Don’t hesitate to ask your hostel for recommendations.
The highest point in the city: Find it! You’ll get great views, even better pictures, and the best memories.

“You aren’t going to have a factory built out of dark matter. You aren’t going to have test pilots who are invisible.”
You aren’t. The factories will be built out of concrete and rebar, the test pilots as visible as your uncle. Even factories and pilots that serve classified aircrafts, the factories that don’t exist, the pilots that spend their days flying planes that never were. This is the world that Trevor Paglen explores. He is trying to circumnavigate this “black world,” a space that exists inside restricted military areas, a space that is observable only through the way it interacts with our own world, our normal, everyday, not-at-all confidential experience.
Paglen spoke as part of Experimental Cartographies, a multi-day workshop co-hosted by the Studio for Creative Inquiry and the Miller Gallery last week. He was part of a series of speakers who explained their work and art, which focused on re-framing popular conceptions of map-making. Paglen himself focused on these explorations of the secret: holes in government budgets, aircrafts that don’t exist, airline companies that are stand-ins for the CIA. And while his work is politically motivated by the climate of terrorism, the methodology is hundreds of years old.
“Minding the heavens” was a description used by Caroline Herschel, the famous German astronomer, to describe the activity she and her brother would perform each night. They memorized the star charts, internalizing the positions of every known object in the sky. They were not processing images by computer, they were not comparing photographic slides; they were searching the heavens for stars that didn’t belong.
Richard Holmes’ account of the Herschels takes center stage in his newest book, Age of Wonder: How the Romantic Generation Discovered the Beauty and Terror of Science. They are the archetypes of romantic scientists, thinkers whose years of education and work led the public to the idealized portrait of a scientist under a tree deducing gravity. But it was their meticulous years spent recording out-of-place “stars” that led to the discovery of dozens of comets, hundreds of galaxies, and Georgium Sidus, the planet that we would come to know as Uranus. The discoveries not only expanded the size of our solar system, but they led to a re-imagining of the size of the entire universe.
Through Experimental Cartographies, we see maps continue to play a crucial role in our understanding of space. But the maps themselves are evolving. We aren’t crossing the oceans from port to port, we are tracking off-the-record flights in and out of Guantanamo Bay, finding a new apartment on Google Street View, and seeing galaxies discovered in the 1780s in exquisite technicolor from the Hubble telescope. However, the message from many of the speakers was one of tempered optimism and cautious conspiracy-theorism: With the maps becoming more technical and information-rich, as consumers we must be mindful of the edges, the details left off, the hidden black worlds.

Since Spoon’s breakthrough album, 2007’s Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga, audiences have been eagerly awaiting the band’s follow-up. But Spoon’s latest record, Transference, disappoints, consisting of the same popped drums and jutting melodies as all of their records.
While some criticized Radiohead’s In Rainbows as Radiohead “attempting” to make a Radiohead album, Spoon has decided to one-up the band by making their newest album nearly the same as the past two, Ga and Gimme Fiction. Perhaps Spoon saw the massive success of In Rainbows and thought that they could emulate that success — or, more likely, Spoon has hit a creative block that they need to overcome to remain relevant. All of the tracks contain the signature Spoon sound.
The middle portion of the album, tracks five through nine, contains the meat of Transference. “Written in Reverse,” the most notable track on the album, consists of several breaks from the beat that give a disorienting experience. The piano’s forcefulness nearly equals the steady drums. While lead singer Britt Daniel is constantly rasping his voice over the top of the music, his lyrics are easily forgettable, especially the horrendous “Writing this to you in reverse/Someone better call a hearse.” Despite its shortcomings, “Written in Reverse” will join “Beast and Dragon, Adored” as the two best heavy jams that Spoon has created.
After “Written in Reverse” comes “I Saw the Light.” The buildup of the track is quite excellent, with Daniel’s voice mixing with the music quite nicely. Daniel oozes suaveness as he nonchalantly sings his portion until the guitars build to their forte. Then, suddenly, at the peak of the track, it turns into an instrumental. While it isn’t terrible, the instrumental section seems as if it were a placeholder for something to be finished later. Much like the entirety of Transference, “I Saw the Light” does not feel finished. Perhaps this rawness is supposed to bring the audience closer to Spoon’s creative process. However, it seems as if they could not deviate extremely far from Ga, so they tried to make very similar songs without the high level of Ga’s production.
“Trouble Comes Running” is another excellent example of a usual “Spoon” track, acting as a microcosm of Transference. Does it have a repeated lyrical theme? Yes. A heavy beat? Yes. Spoon’s typical harsh guitar? Yes. However, the released version of the song is a demo track — meaning it isn’t put through the heavy editing done in studios. It’s an interesting choice by the band, as the track’s haziness distinguishes it from the rest of Spoon’s library. While it might sound extremely similar to many of their previous songs, its execution is laudable.
Transference’s déjà vu doesn’t necessarily ruin the album. While Transference hasn’t been the canonical Spoon album (that title would go to either Ga or Gimme Fiction), it at least attempts at altering the band’s sound. The first half breaks up melodies suddenly and alters them, and “Written in Reverse” is certainly one of Spoon’s best songs. Overall, Transference is an album that contains too many forgettable tracks. Both lyrically and musically, Spoon seems to have hit a creative wall. If Spoon wants to be more than simply the darling of their hometown — Austin, Texas — they must branch out and experiment more with their music.

When one goes off campus for a meal, one expects a great evening out with good food. However, going out for a meal is not just about food, it is also about having a memorable experience. Shadyside is just a short walks away from campus and has plenty of delicious restaurants to try. La Feria is located right above Pamela’s Diner, and it provides a great opportunity for a new culinary journey.
La Feria is a Peruvian restaurant co-owned by Pamela Cohen, owner of Pittsburgh’s favorite American diner Pamela’s, and Luis Perras, a Peruvian native. Because of this, La Feria serves up an American take on the Peruvian kitchen. I have nothing against Americanized food, as long as it is done with an understanding of native food and American cuisine. After all, it is only natural that foreign cuisine is subject to a lack of the same resources. Such constraints provide a great stage for interpretation, as accomplished by well known Mario Batali’s Americanized Italian cuisine or the well-known David Handler’s Americanized Crépe Parisiennes.
Aside from the regular salad and sandwiches, La Feria serves Peruvian foods like empanadas, a dumpling made from pastry dough and various fillings. Not only is La Feria a restaurant, but it also doubles as a self-proclaimed Peruvian craft gallery. The ambience is quite unusual. One feels like a tourist dining in a souvenir shop.
The Piqueo meal for two is fairly proced. It includes a set of two specials, two empanadas, sweet potato chips, rice, French bread, and a salad. The Pepian De Choclo, described by a waiter as a rice soufflé with corn, sweet pepper and Pastel De Papas, reminds one of an English sheperd’s pie with minced beef.
The sweet potato chips were nicely done: very thinly and evenly sliced, fried just until crisp and not oily. They were served with a type of cottage cheese, an intelligent counterpart for the unusual chips. The mild tang to the crisp sweet potato chips was enjoyable. Many places would have over-fried and burned the extra sugar in the potatoes. Unlike most potato dishes, these chips were not filling, but instead added a hint of sweetness to the meal — as if fried in shallot oil.
The empanadas were stuffed with minced chorizo, traditionally referred to as dried sausage and commonly used in Spanish cuisine with minced beef and raisins. The warm chorizo that fills the empanadas reminds one of Indian influences, while the minced beef and raisins were something like a traditional English mincemeat pie.
The Pepian De Choclo was presented with a rice soufflé served next to white rice and a generous cold green salad with standard oil and vinegar dressing. This salad, topped with freshly grated cheese, walnuts, and black olives, was refreshing.
The rice soufflé was lukewarm and unsatisfying, draped over salted mashed rice with corn and pepper strings. Generally, soufflé is an airy, whipped, egg white-based French dish baked in an oven and is usually served as a dessert. I have no objection to creative dishes, but describing mashed rice as a soufflé was misleading. The Pastel De Papas was nothing memorable. If these dishes were really the specials, one would hope the daily menu could prove much stronger.
The history of La Feria can be traced back to 1993, but, despite its history and good reputation, the tables at La Feria last Friday night were surprisingly empty. It was also interesting to note that two drastically different meals, La Feria’s and Pamela’s, were coming out of the same kitchen.
Nonetheless, it can be imagined that a meal like this might be served in a little tourist trap in a popular tourist area somewhere in Peru; westernized native food for foreign travelers.
La Feria is located right on top of Pamela’s Diner. The restaurant is open from Monday to Saturday from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. and the craft gallery is open from Monday to Saturday from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.

One of the most devastating events of history will be recorded as the earthquake that took place on Jan. 12 in Haiti, reaching a magnitude of 7.0 on the Richter scale. The triple earthquake collapsed buildings, crumbled the walls of a prison — allowing almost all of the 4000 prisoners to escape — and claimed the lives of thousands.
Haiti is one of the poorest nations in the western hemisphere, prompting great amounts of support from the rest of the world. People around the world of all ages have come together to pool money and other aid to help the victims of this natural disaster. Children are donating their entire life’s savings and adults are reaching into their funds to contribute what they can. Text messages are being sent and websites have turned into Help Haiti advertisements. Even on Carnegie Mellon’s campus, students have reached out to members of the campus community to donate clothes, food, and money. UPS has even allowed free shipping into the country for packages under 50 pounds.
While it’s been said that no help is too small, many of the world’s greatest leaders and musicians have come together to put on various telethons and concerts to help raise funds to restore the country. Grammy-winning artist Wyclef Jean, who was born in Croix-des-Bouguets, Haiti and later moved to Brooklyn, N.Y. has led efforts to raise money by creating the non-profit organization called Yele Haiti. One of his major campaigns includes cell phone users texting “YELE,” which is a cry for freedom, to 501501, which will automatically donate $5 that will appear on the next cell phone bill.
“Hope For Haiti: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief” — a telethon that was filmed in Los Angeles — aired on Jan. 22 and featured many music artists in efforts to raise money for Haiti. The telethon was transmitted on a wide variety of networks. While stars such as English comedian Russell Brand, Ashley Tisdale, Vanessa Hudgens, actor Gerard Butler, and many others manned the phones, actor George Clooney lent a helping hand by speaking at the event. Performers including Madonna, Alicia Keys, and Jennifer Hudson took the stage to help raise money. The earthquake has evidently caused people around the world, including those not directly impacted by the quake, to speak up.
Artists have even made songs with lyrics speaking directly on the earthquake and calling for action. Caribbean musician Shaggy has written a song called “Rise Again.” The song features Caribbean artists such as reggae singer Sean Paul, Haitian musician Belo, soca artist Allison Hinds from Barbados, and Destra Garcia from Trinidad and Tobago. Also, 76-year-old music legend Quincy Jones is re-recording the song “We are the World” to send the proceeds to Haiti. Paste Magazine has also brought several artists together to create Songs for Haiti which features released and unreleased songs from artists such as Ludacris, Switchfoot, Derek Webb, Hanson, and over 200 other singers.
According to a press release, the magazine’s editor-in-chief, Josh Jackson, said, “Music has always been a force that brings people together, and to have so many fantastic artists drop everything to contribute to this effort was very touching.” In various states across the nation, and around the world, local musicians are holding events to raise money for Haiti. Right here in Pittsburgh, jazz diva Phat Man Dee put on an event called “Send back the Spirit” on Jan. 21 at the Shadow Lounge in East Liberty with a $10 cover charge, and 10 percent of the bar’s sales were sent to support the victims in Haiti. Dee worked with club owner Justin Strong to get performers for the event. “Shadow Lounge has always been active in the local and international community,” Strong said. “If there’s a way to support, we’re going to do it.”
Efforts are still in progress to bring Haiti back on its feet. If you want to help out in any way, or make a donation, please visit www.yele.org.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I just started dating this guy and I really like him, but I can’t help obsessing over the fact that he could break up with me at any moment. How do I get myself to start enjoying this relationship and stop fretting about the future?
—Forever afraid of rejection
Dear FEAR,
Take a moment to stop and ask yourself: Why do you feel this way? Has your boyfriend given you any reason to make you feel insecure? Is he flaky? Noncommittal? Uninterested? If the answer to these questions is yes, then you’re talking to the wrong person. You need to talk to your boyfriend. If he cares about you, he’ll do what he can to reassure you and show that he cares. 
If you have no reason to feel this way, then you need to recognize that this is just paranoia. If you ever feel yourself getting worked up about it, stop and take a deep breath. Really take in your surroundings. Feel the air in your lungs, your boyfriend next to you, the fun you’re having with him. Take that moment and revel in it. You’re in a relationship and you’re both happy. You have no reason to fret.
Live in the moment,
—Patrick Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I’ve been seeing this guy who refuses to commit to me. He says he knows what he wants, but he avoids the subject of exclusivity. Is it wrong for me to feel annoyed? Should he be willing to commit?
—Sick of only liking one
Dear SOLO,
He may know what he wants, but the real question is: what do you want? It sounds to me like you want to be exclusive with him, meaning you need to sit down and hash this out. If he doesn’t want to commit, then you have two options: stick around and put up with him, or head for greener pastures. You can’t force him to be exclusive or to be in a relationship with you — his feelings are his own, and as valid as yours, and you have no right to change him. But if he wants to be with you, let him know that you need some measure of exclusivity. If this guy is the right fit for you, he’ll want to be with you. Think of your relationship as a glove: You can’t force your way into a glove that isn’t right for you. It’s no reason to be mad at the glove; that’s just how it is. Of course, if the glove keeps sliding off, that’s reason enough to be angry. Just remember: If the glove don’t fit, you can’t commit. 
Talk it out,
—Brian Hoskins

Pittsburgh remains covered by up to 24 inches of snow — a situation that has shut down roads, businesses, and most mass transit services, including all but one Port Authority bus route. Both incoming and outgoing flights at both Pittsburgh International and Allegheny County airports have been grounded until further notice.
On Carnegie Mellon’s campus, normal operations have also been affected. Housing and Dining Services announced that dining will be “operating in a limited capacity.” This meant a delayed start time for many of the on-campus dining options including Skibo Cafe and the Underground. 
Many of the campus’s facilities have also closed due to the weather. The bookstore, computer store, and art store remain closed for the full day Saturday. Hunt Library and the Engineering and Science Library are also closed.
Crews from Facilities Management Services (FMS) continue to clear roadways, pedestrian walkways, and surface parking lots. Three trees near Hamburg Hall, near the FMS Building, and at the corner of Devon Road and Forbes Avenue have also fallen due to snowfall. Crews are reported to be working to clear the areas affected.
However, despite the snow, students have continued to roam the campus, organizing snowball fights, pancake breakfasts, and sledding.
Campus alerts remind students to “be careful and take extra precautions this weekend as roadways and walkways can be treacherous.”
Monday classes have been cancelled as a result of winter weather
The campus community can check www.cmu.edu/alert for updates on weather-related closings.

Wednesday is a big day for Carnegie Mellon’s student government. The Undergraduate Student Senate and Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) will be voting on a number of changes to the student body constitution and its supporting documents that address a variety of current inefficiencies. These changes include the addition of an elected role, the student body vice  president of organizations (SBVPO), to the executive branch, as well as the creation of an advisory committee that includes the Student Dormitory Council (SDC) and the Activities Board (AB). 
Ruth Poproski, a Ph.D. student in philosophy, joined the President’s Cabinet as constitutional advisor this year with the main intention of taking on this project.
“A major part of this project has been one of clarification and organization,” Poproski said. “Someone should be able to pick up the constitution and understand the role of student government.”
Poproski worked with a committee of five students, in addition to Student Senate, GSA, SDC, AB, and the Office of Student Activities. 
Senate is in clear favor of the addition of the SBVPO and an advisory committee with SDC and AB, as seen at last Thursday’s meeting.
 The SBVPO will become a position that is part of the student body elections in the spring. The new officer will join the executive branch, whose other members are the student body president, student body vice president, student body vice president of finance, Student Senate chair, and GSA president. 
“I think that there needs to be better communication with student government in terms of financing,” said Emily Anderson, a junior decision science and business double major and vice president of the Carnegie Mellon Business Association. 
Poproski said the new position will begin to address such issues. “The job of the VPO, in a very general sense, will be to make the situation better and to legitimize the needs of student organizations,” she said.
Poproski mentioned that the addition of an advisory committee that includes SDC and AB will bridge another area lacking connection. “One of the problems that has been acknowledged from several perspectives is the lack of communication and collaboration between student government and SDC,” Poproski said.
Originally, the idea was brought to the table that SDC form an external branch of student government. However, the alternate approach of an advisory committee was considered as a better solution, and AB was added for communication.
Aaron Gross, a junior decision science and H&SS interdisciplinary double major and Student Senate chair, spoke of the possibility of bringing other organizations into the committee. 
“At one of our past meetings, someone brought up Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Council,” Gross said. 
The Panhellenic Council and Interfraternity Council are the governing bodies of the sororities and fraternities on campus, respectively. 
These issues are just some of the proposals on the table for Student Senate and GSA to discuss and vote on this Wednesday.
Editor's note: Aaron Gross was the 2009 Layout Co-Manager for The Tartan. He is currently part of the layout staff.

According to Carl Kurlander, executive producer of Steeltown Entertainment Project  and producer of Saved By The Bell, “[Pittsburgh’s] greatest export isn’t steel; it’s talent.” As a response to the lack of outlets available for local talent, Kurlander and fellow panelists Asher Garfinkel, president of Readers Unlimited; Bernie Goldmann, producer of 300; Laura Harkcom, writer and producer of The Lost Room; and Minnette Seate, senior producer of WQED Multimedia came together with Steeltown Entertainment’s Film Factory to host a contest called “Scripted Readings: Does the Story Work” that would help alleviate this problem. This project allowed aspiring screenwriters in Pittsburgh to pitch screenplays for potential movies to some of Hollywood’s best producers, with a chance of winning $25,000 to turn their scripts into movies. Ten semi-finalists were chosen to have their scripts performed in front of a live audience. 
Twelve sophomores from Carnegie Mellon’s School of Drama presented these scripts in front of an intimate audience and collection of judges last Saturday. Two members of the cast, Alex Rice and Annie Heise, both sophomore acting majors, agreed that “it was a great opportunity,” because usually only juniors and seniors perform in Carnegie Mellon drama productions.
Judges remarked on the diversity among submissions. However, each script contained common underlying elements specific to the Pittsburgh area. Adriana Ramirez, a visiting lecturer at the University of Pittsburgh, took a darker tone in her screenplay N’At, stating that “[in Pittsburgh] the winter, like the metal, is cold and hard.” 
Ramirez’s script was a favorite, according to Heise. “[It was] funny, creative, and very real,” Heise said.
After this event, contestants will be given time to rewrite their screenplays. One final winner will earn the $25,000 prize and have the chance to turn their scripts into a movie. The finished production will preview at Pittsburgh’s Three Rivers Film Festival next year.

When an earthquake struck the island nation of Haiti nearly three weeks ago, the United States was quick to respond. Carnegie Mellon students were encouraged by faculty, student government, and the many service organizations on campus to send whatever help they could to the millions of affected Haitians. Carnegie Mellon’s Division of Student Affairs and student government organized and headed various events to help the cause, while hundreds of students went to great lengths to show their support for Haiti relief.
Student Body President Rotimi Abimbola was responsible for organizing the groups together and encouraging collaboration across organizations. Two days after the first quake struck, nearly 20 campus groups met to discuss their options. “Everybody had [a] small idea of what they wanted to do,” said Abimbola. “Everyone wanted to do something.”
These small ideas grew at an unmatched pace. Over the past two weeks, hundreds of dollars were collected and sent to nonprofit organizations like Doctors Without Borders and the Brother’s Brothers Foundation. Services were held in the form of prayer groups and candlelit vigils to honor those who lost their lives and their loved ones. Students also tried to address the serious medical issues facing Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake. Around campus, groups set up boxes that encouraged students to deposit hygienic items to send to the victims, including buckets, hairbrushes, toothpaste, and toothbrushes. Other divisions of Carnegie Mellon, including the Silicon Valley campus in California, pledged support.
“Haiti’s always been really unfortunate,” said first-year computer science major Sammy Jelin, who collected donations on behalf of Student Life. “It’s good people are helping out.”
Besides funds, Carnegie Mellon has also been utilizing its technological expertise. The Language Technologies Institute has worked on an updated translation system using new translating technology to convert Creole, the language spoken by most of Haiti’s population, into other languages, including French, the language spoken by much of Haiti’s upper class. Once the translation data becomes available in a readable format, the Paris organization Translators Without Borders has promised to distribute it to relief workers in Haiti.
Bridging communication gaps is a crucial step in providing relief. Abimbola has seen firsthand the importance of translating in her experience with caring for orphans who moved from Haiti to Pittsburgh. She expressed her frustration at being unable to reassure these Haitian children of their safety and well-being, and that it “broke [her] heart.”
Carnegie Mellon has also considered the future of Haiti, and has taken several paths to contribute to the long-term recovery of the nation. Once the funds have been finalized, they will be distributed to their respective charity organizations as soon as possible. Carnegie Mellon has also not ruled out the possibility of taking on another project such as, Abimbola alluded, the reconstruction of a school and sending Carnegie Mellon students to Haiti as teachers. The School of Drama’s class of 2010 plans to dedicate their senior cabaret to Haiti and its reconstruction. An unnamed alumnus has pledged to match whatever amount of money Carnegie Mellon raises, dollar for dollar, with a donation of their own.
The relief effort has not been without controversy. One of the organizations to which Carnegie Mellon has pledged funds, Haitian singer Wyclef Jean’s Yéle foundation, has been under scrutiny for misdirecting funds. Such exploitation has left many feeling unwilling to donate without seeing the changes that their money will bring. Sharon Wang, a senior materials science major, expressed her belief that these people were “discouraged by the size of the [Helping Haiti] project” and unsure of what they could do.
Despite the long road to recovery ahead and the obstacles presently facing students, Abimbola believes that the campus community remains dedicated to joining together. “Despite our roles as organization leaders and students on campus,” she said, “you can still do things to help.”

The Carnegie Mellon Biometrics Lab, led by electrical and computer engineering research scientist Marios Savvides, is exploring ways to improve facial and iris recognition technology through support from agencies such as the Department of Defense (DoD), the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Savvides has also been selected to be part of a Center of Academic Excellence called the Center for Academic Studies in Identity Sciences through the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Face recognition requires several steps, all of which students at Savvides’ lab are developing for applications in the real world. Once completed, these separate components will be combined.
In the laboratory, students work at a multi-step process so that one day cameras will easily identify a face from any angle. The first step is getting the camera to track the face’s movements. A camera follows a student walking backward the entire distance of the lab, and the green circle that predicts the head’s movement provides successful results.
Next, the camera needs to identify the person. Yet, what if the person now wears glasses or has cut his or her hair? Especially in a security situation, a suspect will often try to disguise his or her features. “We are trying to add human intelligence to face matchers,” Savvides said. Once a picture is taken, the computer can quickly relay the face’s gender, any facial hair, and if the subject is wearing glasses, all within a certain degree of accuracy. The program will select 20 faces that best match the picture taken. These pictures have a high enough “bare score” to qualify them as a match to the original picture. Hopefully, adding the human intelligence component will reduce the risk of a computer identifying the wrong people. “The worst thing that could happen is that you do the top 20 [matches] and the bare score that would have matched is not even in the top-20 list,” said Savvides.
Next, the laboratory explores how to identity a person if their face is at a different angle. Current cameras are only able to capture a face from ± 15 degrees. With the lab’s work, this technology could soon match any angle. From only a 2-D photo, Jingu Heo, an electrical and computer engineering graduate student, can create a 3-D model of the face with stunning detail, as demonstrated with 3-D models of Jay Leno’s faces formed from 2-D pictures located online.
In a separate room is a full-length scanner, similar to those in airports. The catch is that this one can identify your iris from up to 13 meters. The lab is working to make the images clearer by aligning several images of the iris into one higher-resolution image. A real-world application of this, explained Vijayakumar Bhagavatula, a professor in the department of electrical and computer engineering, is already in use in Canadian airports. “They use it for crew and people that use the airport very regularly. Instead of having them go through the standard check lines, they enroll the iris images of these people beforehand with background screening.” Additionally, Savvides and his team are working to create an iris fingerprint, a way to visually prove that an iris is a correct match.
In the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) and Iris Challenge Evaluation, the projects met with success in 2005, when Savvides and Bhagavatula’s team won first place at FRGC. They developed “an algorithm [that] went from a 12 percent verification rate to 82.4 percent verification. Most companies were between 35 and 50 percent,” said Savvides.
With this technology, instead of a soldier measuring a villager’s iris by hand, a system could scan villagers’ irises from a distance, thanks to a $3–4 million project Savvides has with the DoD. Cameras could identify suspects before they reached human guards. A personal computer could turn off if its user left. Yet, with the advent of new technology also come privacy concerns for the subjects. 
“My current research focuses on how to consider security, privacy, usability, and costs at the design stage, even before a system is built,” said Cai.
It will be rewarding to continue to monitor the Carnegie Mellon Biometrics Lab in the future, as much of their work may integrate into our daily lives. “If anything we do in this lab can save one life or make a difference, then we have done our jobs,” Savvides said.

The Carnegie Science Center announced its 2010 Carnegie Science Awards last Thursday.
“Each year the Carnegie Science Awards shines the spotlight on extraordinary researchers, entrepreneurs, and educators working in science and technology fields,” said Henry Buhl, Jr., co-director of the Carnegie Science Center, in the organization’s press release. “Our region generates amazing talent and cutting-edge technology and advances in science-related industries. The awards program recognizes the best and the brightest .”
While two other professors from Carnegie Mellon University received awards — computer science professor Luis von Ahn won the award in Information Technology and biology professor Alison Barth was named an honorable mention for the Emerging Female Scientist Award — Carnegie Mellon students studying civil and chemical engineering may recognize Gregory V. Lowry’s name as an honorable mention for the Environmental Award.
“Gregory Lowry is developing nanotechnology that can be used to clean up pollutants, such as chlorinated solvents and heavy metals in drinking water. This technology promises to be less intrusive and energy-intensive than conventional cleanup approaches,” said Courtney Horne, a public relations representative for Lowry.
What makes Lowry stand out to students is that, in addition to his research, he is also teaching 12-351 (Environmental Engineering) this semester. Typically, professors investing in groundbreaking research have little time to devote to a class of undergraduates. Yet Lowry holds approximately three hours of class  each  week and encourages his students to e-mail him.
“He can be very interested in what he teaches. His lecture style is very engaging, and he wants to impart his knowledge [to] his students,” said Michael Panzitta, a junior civil and environmental engineering major.

LTI translates Haitian Creole
The Language Technologies Institute (LTI) has recently released its textual and spoken data on Haitian Creole, the most common language spoken in Haiti. (Hatian Creole and French share official language status.) This data is useful, as language has proven to be a barrier in the attempts of doctors, nurses, and various aid workers to help the Haitian population since the earthquake nearly three weeks ago.
The LTI — a branch of the School of Computer Science that also focuses on subjects such as speech processing and computer-assisted language learning — has been using this data to develop a new version of an outdated translation system that was first created in the 1990s for a project under the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Researchers at Microsoft have also been using the data to create a web-based system for translating between English and Haitian Creole. 
Furthermore, a nonprofit organization, Translators Without Borders, plans on giving out a medical triage dictionary as soon as these data are available in a readable format.
These parallel efforts are part of a wider relief effort around the world. The LTI has emphasized that there are many diverse and nontraditional ways in which one can help those suffering in Haiti.
John Kitchin wins research grant
John Kitchin, an assistant professor of chemical engineering, was recently awarded a five-year $750,000 Early Career Award from the U.S. Department of Energy. The grant will be used to develop new materials in electrochemistry that will allow scientists to derive hydrogen and oxygen from water.
Kitchin’s contributions to his field are particularly noteworthy when considering he only completed his Ph.D. in chemical engineering in 2004. Kitchin hopes that his research will provide for a more efficient means of producing hydrogen from water, which will hopefully lead to the development of energy systems that can store renewable energy in chemical form. Kitchin’s research lays a foundation for the production of a biomass that could possibly fuel everything from cars to factories. Moreover, Kitchin stated in a press release on the Carnegie Mellon website that the oxygen produced “may play a crucial role in helping to manage the CO2 emissions through advanced fossil energy power systems such as oxycombustion and gasification.”
This award is funded by the Early Career Research Program as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Kitchin is one of 69 professors nationwide to receive funding under this act.

Design for Social Innovation and Sustainability: Design as Catalyser of Diffuse Creativity for Sustainable Changes
Wednesday, Feb. 3 
at 4:30 p.m.
Giant Eagle Auditorium, Baker Hall A51
Ezio Manzini, professor of design at the Politecnico di Milano in Italy, will talk about social innovation, how citizens are now capable of moving outside the mainstream models of living and producing, and how they are now inventing new and sustainable ones. 
Manzini says that this social innovation is driven by diffuse creativity and entrepreneurship, meaning that resources are very abundant, even in the densely populated and highly connected world we are a part of. Continuing on this path, the next model could quite possibly become a director of change.
The Moral and Political Challenges of Climate Change
Thursday, Feb. 4 
at 4:30 p.m.
Gregg Hall, Porter Hall 100
Dale Jamieson, director of environmental studies and professor of environmental studies and philosophy at New York University, says that in order to see anthropogenic climate change as involving moral wrongs and global injustices, we need to revise some central concepts about these very domains. Also, he believes climate change threatens another value — respect for nature — that can’t easily be taken up by global justice concerns or moral responsibilities.

Yesterday, the Braddock branch of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) closed its doors for good.
Since the $8 billion nonprofit announced on Oct. 16 that it would be closing UPMC Braddock, grassroots organizations such as Save Our Community Hospitals have mobilized protesters to speak out against what they see as injustice being done to the community. People protesting the closure of UPMC Braddock — including those activists dressed up as zombies and others hosting a mock corporate board meeting on the streets of downtown Pittsburgh — are complaining that UPMC is abandoning the community of Braddock and that the closure is the result of corporate greed.
Beyond the closure of this branch alone, though, is the overarching nationwide issue of closures of hospital branches in under-served neighborhoods. While we recognize that running a hospital is a business operation like any other, there has to be an overhaul in the way health care is distributed and prioritized in the Pittsburgh area. Paul Wood, a spokesman for UPMC, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that the user rate of the Braddock branch had declined “below levels necessary to sustain it.”
But what about those people who moved to Braddock because of the once-promising branch? While protesters initially called the closure illegal, a judge ruled Friday that it was not. Regardless of the legality of the issue, the fact is that the vastness of the UPMC branches is known as an important aspect of our city’s emphasis on health care. If branches begin to close, succumbing to economic woes and leaving patients without immediate access to an emergency room, UPMC’s image as a prominent center of research and patient care could be negatively affected. 
One benefit that will emerge from the closure of UPMC Braddock is its evolution into a space for high school classrooms. Students will be able to work hands-on in a real medical setting, hopefully better preparing them for careers in medicine. This long-term benefit to the community is indeed an important one, though prioritizing the long-term over the short-term may compromise Braddock overall.

Around 1 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 22, cell phones went off in classrooms across campus. “Wean Hamerschlag & Doherty Hall are being evacuatged [sic] for a security threat,” a university-wide notification stated. In the hours following this message, multiple — although hardly informative — updates were posted on the University Alert website, and e-mails were sent to the campus community. But more than a week after much of our campus was evacuated, we have learned almost nothing that was not included in that original 80-character alert.
Though everyone on campus has learned via rumor or fact that the “unconfirmed security threat” was actually a bomb threat, the university administration showed only a false transparency. Updates were sent during the situation, and we appreciate the information we did get. Secrecy during an emergency situation is reasonable. However, while the knowledge that police swept the buildings and pronounced them clear was reassuring, it did not tell us the facts we wanted to know.
Without clear communication from the administration, there is no way to differentiate the truth from speculation. If a land purchase on Forbes Avenue warrants an extensive explanation by President Cohon, surely a threat to our security — even a false threat — deserves more than a couple of terse and ambiguous e-mails.
Even the communication the university did provide would not have been effective in an actual crisis, where a rapid response is essential. The emergency alert system, which is ostensibly designed for situations just like these, did not notify some students by text message or phone call until more than half an hour after the original e-mail was sent and an hour after police first responded.
If Carnegie Mellon intends for students to trust its alert system, it must have a rapid, effective system of notification, and it must give students enough information to make responsible decisions.

“I make a difference!” states a sticker a friend of mine received at the recent American Red Cross blood drive. However, my friend didn’t wear the sticker; instead it’s now stuck inside the back cover of his textbook. It’s a bit ironic that my friend has this sticker cheerfully announcing the nobility of his acts, considering the fact that his blood was rejected. The sticker didn’t exactly serve its purpose; however, the form he received titled “Indefinite Deferral” certainly did. The form made it very clear that my friend cannot give blood because he is gay.
The Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Indefinite Deferral Policy has permanently barred any man who has had sex with another man (even once) since 1977 from donating blood. Even more shocking is the fact that this ban has been in place for over 20 years — it was put in place in 1983, the first year of the AIDS crisis. 
The American Red Cross, the American Association of Blood Banks, and America’s Blood Centers, which collect almost all the blood used for transfusions nationwide, have all stepped up to argue for an end to the policy. However, in 2007 the FDA chose to uphold the ban. According to the FDA, the ban is in place because “a history of male-to-male sex is associated with an increased risk for the presence of and transmission of certain infectious diseases, including HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.”
For my friend, and for many other students on campus and around the country, this policy is an act of outright discrimination. In 1977, when the ban was created, it may have been warranted. However, to continue that ban today is a ridiculous act of stereotyping — especially considering the FDA’s policies for other groups. Most high-risk groups are deferred for one year — a time frame that is minuscule in comparison to the indefinite deferral gay men receive. Even heterosexual individuals who have had sex with an HIV-positive partner are allowed to donate blood after a one-year deferral period. 
This is an especially relevant question when the current HIV/AIDS testing procedures are considered. The HIV tests currently in use are incredibly accurate — the chances of a false negative are less than one per 2 million in the United States, according to the FDA’s statistics.
Carnegie Mellon plans to host 11 blood drives this year. For many students, these blood drives will represent bigotry and prejudice. With blood shortages across the globe — especially in devastated areas of Haiti — it’s ridiculous that the blood banks would turn down perfectly healthy, acceptable blood. All healthy students should have the opportunity to give blood, regardless of their sexual orientation. All students should have the opportunity to “make a difference.”

My mother got my family a set of Snuggies for Christmas.
Actually, they weren’t the Snuggie™ blankets, per se, but a pretty accurate imitation from the Bed and Bath section of Macy’s. They were your average quilt-like material on the outside and cotton-flannel inside, with an array of strategically placed buttons holding the whole thing together. They came in a large cardboard box, using up a fair amount of wrapping paper. It’s ironic to think that a garment whose purpose is to swaddle you was over-swaddled in holiday packaging. I wasn’t too convinced at the beginning.
In any case, never in my life would I have thought that I would be a Snuggie-imitator owner. They looked ridiculous in the infomercials, but maybe that’s just an indication of my snobbery. I wasn’t quite convinced by a garment that was halfway between a classy living room throw blanket and nightwear pajamas, but that’s probably just an indication of my non-acceptance. Plus, as a Carnegie Mellon student, I couldn’t imagine getting that comfortable — sitting on a cushy couch, wrapped in warm, soft material, leisurely reading a magazine. Snuggies were impractical garments for an unattainable lifestyle, so I dismissed them.
Until they showed up under my Christmas tree. Wanting to be an informed Snuggie owner, I fully researched all the uses, benefits, and risks. The official Snuggie website proclaims that their product is perfect for sporting events, chilly office buildings, and... nighttime pub crawls? Needless to say, I took some of their suggestions and ignored others. But if anyone sees Snuggied-up bar-goers in PHI Bar anytime, please inform me.
The official Snuggie website also featured nice pictures of people and their Snuggies in a natural environment. Which means, of course, that the pictures were just beautifully staged. They showed a good-looking couple enjoying a date night by the fire, a mother reading to her child, and a woman on a plane.
I knew I could never attain the idyllic lives of those Snuggie owners, which is probably why I’m a pseudo-Snuggie owner. While the original Snuggie is somewhat figure-conforming, my pseudo-Snuggie was basically a quilt folded over twice with holes for my arms and head. It was kind of funny-looking, and thus I never would wear it outside of immediate family, but I grew to like it over time. You could never take it camping or actually sleep with it, but the idea grew on me, and before long I became attached to it. It is actually quite warm, which is the primary reason my mother got them and immediately lowered the thermostat to a cool 60 degrees.
“It was the best $19.95 I’ve ever spent,” my mother said. “Saves a bunch on our heating bills.”

I arrived last summer in Shanghai as the individualist American most of us are brought up to be: Chinese books in one hand and the Constitution in the other. I made sure to educate myself on all the current issues of the place that would be my home for the next two months. I read about censorship issues, the Communist Party’s tortures, the disappearance of Chinese civil rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng exactly one year ago from this week (Feb. 2, 2009) after documenting victims’ accounts of physical and verbal abuse. I witnessed firsthand the week-long shutdown of Google, the moment from when Facebook was no longer available, and I had to replace YouTube, also banned, with the Chinese version Youku.
It is no longer only speculation that China may very well be taking center stage with extraordinary power and influence — it is merely common knowledge now. The United States has gradually been stripped of the international attention it is used to. However, hard set on the values that we feel have historically made the U.S. the “land of opportunity” it is, we have remained insistent on the spread of democracy dictated by Manifest Destiny: In other words, it’s not our fault God chose us to save the world.
Hillary Clinton sure seems to think so, as in a speech a couple of weeks ago, she listed China among the nations that engage in massive censorship of the information they make available to the public and thus pose a threat to international security. She went on to urge the Chinese government not only to conduct investigations on the recent attacks on Google, but also to make the findings available to the public. Is it not perhaps a tad pretentious of Clinton to expect the Chinese government with its centuries of history to have a spontaneous epiphany: “You know what, Hillary, I hadn’t thought of that.... Thanks for showing us the light.”
An official Chinese newspaper commented on Clinton’s speech several days later, calling it “a part of the U.S. campaign to impose its values and denigrate other cultures by exploiting their societies’ vulnerabilities....”
We all agree that everyone deserves to have access to the truth; nevertheless, could it also be possible that the Chinese government acted negatively due to feelings of public humiliation? And perhaps we’ve found the problem.
Last summer in Shanghai, my teacher — native Chinese — explained to us one day in class that among the many social priorities of Chinese society, one proves as true today as it did hundreds of years ago: “saving face.” “Face” refers to the perspective you build of yourself within public opinion — it is the image we construct of ourselves before others. My teacher went on to explain that in China, there is no greater sign of disrespect than publicly humiliating another. Obama promised in his campaign to improve U.S.-China ties, but we should be careful that upon removing the fly from our friend’s forehead, we don’t strip off their face in the process.
It seems clear to me at first sight that the recent Google.cn dispute was inevitable: The threat to the Chinese government’s control seems to be directly proportional to the growth of the population and the development of its society. In today’s globalizing international community, where open access to the international network and socioeconomic progress seem to go hand in hand, it’s only a matter of time before the steady development of Chinese society grows too much for the inflexible skin of communism to contain.
Like most Americans, I was brought up assuming my natural rights to free speech and the chase of my own dreams — cultivating my individuality. It never occurred to me that it might not be the case for everyone; we often fail to remember that the founding fathers didn’t tour the planet: Different countries have unique customs and laws. In the case of how each individual society develops in the specific way that it does, history does not always repeat itself.

Whoever thought a movie about blue aliens would have movie buffs around the world up in arms? But so the world goes when James Cameron tries to reassert himself as the king of the world.
With Avatar surpassing James Cameron’s previous work, Titanic, as the worldwide highest-grossing movie of all time this past week — and likely to pass the same milestone for number one domestically in a few days — many have been grappling with what this actually means. Is Avatar really as good as its box office total? Is Avatar’s box office total even as good as it seems, after inflation and 3-D markup? I, with my amazing ability to cram large amounts of information into small places, will tackle these frequently asked Avatar questions (FA*A*Qs) one by one.
The way inflation is getting thrown around as a blanket discounter is very problematic. Inflation is working against all of us, I know, but let’s analyze this with a more discerning eye. Back in 1965, people were lining up to buy tickets for box office legend The Sound of Music at an average price of $1. According to dollartimes.com, something that was priced at $1 in 1965 costs $6.92 today. Meanwhile, the average ticket price has risen to $7.46 since 1965. Ticket prices are increasing faster than the rest of what we purchase.
At first this may seem like fruit for the argument that inflation is boosting Avatar’s total gross. But as anyone with some economics savvy can tell you, this could in fact dissuade many people from purchasing movie tickets with cheaper entertainment alternatives to pursue. If you now consider that the 3-D tickets are marked up more than their 2-D counterparts, you can see there is a huge pressure on viewers not only against watching Avatar, but coming back to watch it again in 3-D.
The question of whether or not Avatar deserves its box office gross is, well, quite hilarious. Did Wayne Gretzky deserve to score more goals than anyone in the history of his sport? Does Joe Smith deserve it when he gets a 100 percent on an exam?
Many feel Avatar has an unfair advantage over past movies due to its groundbreaking 3-D experience. This is barely a half-truth.
Avatar is probably one of the greatest fusions we have seen of technology and well-executed storytelling. Where many big-budget films flop in the storytelling department (see Transformers, and the most recent Spider-Man and Star Wars installments), Cameron is able to fuse the 3-D experience with the story he is trying to tell, instead of allowing one to shortchange the other. 
Resisting the urge to create gimmicky 3-D scenes with the purpose of shocking the audience, Cameron utilizes the third dimension to subtly accentuate the background of each scene. This would have taken as much creative thought as the angle of the camera, the prose of the dialogue, or the approach of the actors. 
In short, technology is as much a part of the creative cinematic process as any other aspect. And that Avatar pioneers this new facet and sets the bar for the future does give it an advantage over other films, although not an unfair one at all. Movie-making is about innovation, and never has the use of special effects been considered to be outside the lines.
These questions are starting to get a little too personal. But this has been a fairly angst-ridden topic. Somehow, somewhere along the line, the idea of box office gross has gotten blurred with artistic merit. In the top 25 movies by gross, you can find The Godfather at number 21, with no appearance by Citizen Kane or Casablanca. These movies are widely considered to be the three greatest films of all time. The Phantom Menace grossed more than all three of these!
The amount of money a movie grosses is a marriage between good marketing and having strong appeal across all demographics, rather than artistic merit. The subtleties of a Coppola or Scorsese film that get movie-critic purists drooling aren’t necessarily what moviegoers are looking for. 
James Cameron has realized this once again, wedding a tried-and-true human storyline with never-before-seen movie technology, while creating as much hype as he could muster. Moviegoers want to see something new, while being told something that they believe dearly to be true. They can get all of this with a ticket to Avatar, no matter what the price.

President Obama has been in office for a year now, and accordingly graced our television screens last week to give the country his first State of the Union address.
The address was, as could be expected, a well-written, intellectual speech, delivered by a President who has deservedly retained his title as the best orator of our time. The talk was certainly meant to re-energize his base, his grassroots network of young, liberal Democrats. 
The last year has been rife with criticism of Obama not actually accomplishing  his campaign promises — not just from Republicans and pundits, but from the egregiously liberal media and even Saturday Night Live. Guantanamo Bay is still open, Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell has not been repealed, large numbers of troops are still in Iraq, and the healthcare bill continues to stagnate in Congress. 
This speech needed to discuss those policy issues, including the reasons the policies may not have moved forward as quickly as we may have hoped. He was able to critically discuss the actions and behavior of Congress, of the Supreme Court, and even of his own involvement in pushing policy into action. 
While we understand that Obama is attempting to govern a legislative branch that has mastered the filibuster, in a difficult economic climate (and a literally ever-more frighteningly changing climate), we continue to hold him to the ideals he came in with. His speech brought back the optimism, the hope, but we will continue to push him for actual change.
In the end, the speech was just talk. As inspiring as Obama’s words can be, as President he must do more. 
This was just another evening, just another speech, just another State of the Union that has come and gone. And possibly most important to America, it didn’t conflict with the season premiere of Lost. That would have been a big deal.

With the beginning of a new semester and year, The Tartan looks forward to a fresh start with a new editorial staff, and as publisher and editor-in-chief, Kristen and I have our own goals for the paper. We believe that it is essential that The Tartan strongly represent our campus community, and this is among our goals for the semester.
Currently, our staff represents our campus’s diverse student population, but with fresh recruitment we hope to expand our organization. Also, by featuring columns like Tales from Abroad in Pillbox and Athlete Profile in Sports, The Tartan aims to personalize content and add a face to the article. 
In the days to come, we are happy to announce that readers will be able to see a more active representation of our campus through The Tartan’s collaboration with other student organizations. We have formalized a partnership with cmuTV that will allow readers to view not just photos, but videos of events on The Tartan website. Our first such multimedia venture will be the coverage of Bhangra in the Burgh, so watch for video clips of the competition accompanying a review of the event.
Kristen and I also think it is important for us to reach out to our sister campus in Doha, Qatar and allow for different perspectives in the newspaper. With this objective in mind, we have finalized an article exchange with CMU-Q’s publication the All Around in the hope that this new content will keep us updated on what’s happening on the other side of the world.
As the semester progresses, we are excited to see our alliances with cmuTV and the All Around grow, and hope that we can forge lasting partnerships with more campus organizations as we strive to represent and be more active in the Carnegie Mellon community.
