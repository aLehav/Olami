The Tartans lost a low-scoring bout in St. Louis on Saturday to the Washington University in St. Louis Bears, 25–3. The loss brings the Tartans to 5–3 on the season and the Bears to 3–5. 
Despite the loss, junior wide receiver Tim Kikta moved within 63 yards of the Carnegie Mellon single-season receiving yards record. He tallied 56 receiving yards against the Bears. 
“Tim is one of the hardest working guys on the team. Him and [junior quarterback] Rob [Kalkstein] worked hard all summer to establish a strong connection,” said senior running back Jake Nardone. “He’s always been a guy who worked hard for all the right reasons.”
Offensively, the Tartans struggled to get anything going all game. Kalkstein completed 16 of 30 passes for 128 yards and failed to find the end zone. Additionally, the Tartans only rushed for 98 yards, with first-year running back Troy Witt leading the way with 47 yards.
On the bright side, the Carnegie Mellon defense looked sharp, holding the Bears to just 15 points and 328 total yards. Sophomore safety Shae Sealey and senior outside linebacker Owen Parker each had an interception as well.
Unfortunately, the offense could not capitalize on the stellar defense.
The Tartans average 219.6 passing yards per game, and the run game has averaged 188.2 yards per game. But the Bears’ defense really stifled the Tartans’ offense, as their output was subpar on Saturday.
The Bears’ defensive line put pressure on Kalkstein throughout the game, sacking him four times for a total of 18 yards lost. The Bears’ junior defensive lineman Seth Wight had two of the four sacks. Additionally, the Bears accumulated nine tackles for a total of 25 yards lost.
This is the Tartans’ second consecutive loss, and their third loss in their last four games after starting the season 4–0.
The Tartans look to regain momentum this Saturday in their home game against the University of Chicago.

New to the Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team is the fun and fearless first-year Elizabeth Martin, hailing from St. Simon’s Island, Ga. Since the beginning of the season, Martin has consistently been one of the top players on the team, in spite of her transition into college life.
“I’ve been pleased with my performance and my team’s performance so far this season. Even though college tennis is more pressure than high school, I think I’ve adjusted well,” Martin said. “I really love playing for the team.”
In the Carnegie Mellon Invitational last month, Martin paired with sophomore Jana Motie to defeat Duquesne University 8–5 and won her singles match 8–2. Her dominance continued into the ITA Regional, where she was originally ninth-ranked and advanced to a highly contested championship match against sophomore Megan Buell of Washington & Lee University.
In addition to her strong singles matches, Martin paired with sophomore Bryn Raschke to defeat senior Sallie Griffin and sophomore Allison Hupalo of Washington & Lee 8–2 in the quarterfinals. The pair then dropped the semifinal match to Buell and junior Claire Cahill of Washington & Lee in a tightly contested 8–6 match.
Her passionate tennis playing has not gone unnoticed by her teammates. Raschke described Martin as the “ideal partner, who always keeps the atmosphere fun on the team.”
“Elizabeth was really fun to play with,” she said. “We laughed and joked a lot, which is one of the reasons I love doubles, so it was great having a partner who was really enjoying herself. She’s so fun, and the way she chooses to end points by whacking her backhand for winners was awesome. She was always willing to try something new. ITA’s really shown how solid of a player Elizabeth is.”
The admiration seems to be mutual, as Martin said that she decided to come to Carnegie Mellon because of the “close-knit atmosphere” of the 11-member team.
“While we always are tough in competition, we love to have fun and joke with each other,” Martin said. “Our group text messages always make me giggle.”
Along with her laughs come her tennis aspirations; Martin hopes to win a national title as “either an individual or a team” during her college career. “An NCAA Division III championship would be absolutely incredible,” Martin said.
“Elizabeth has been a great young addition to our roster. She brings a positive and hard-working attitude to practice every day, and I expect an excellent rookie season from her,” assistant coach Mike Belmonte said.
Martin is not only serious about her tennis playing; she has high expectations regarding her schoolwork as well. Currently a decision science major, she hopes to go to medical school to become an allergist.
“I find the immune system fascinating,” Martin said. “I know, I’m so weird.”
With a full course load, Martin is the first to say, “It’s so much work.” But, always keeping a smile on her face, she said “my favorite class is chemistry when I get extra credit.”
The tennis season will pick up again in February, where a bubbly Martin looks forward to “representing the Carnegie Mellon team and something other than myself. I feel serious and committed when I [put on] that Tartan uniform. And I don’t like to lose while wearing it.”

The men’s soccer team added another University Athletic Association (UAA) win Friday afternoon after defeating the New York University Violets; the team is now 11–2–1 and 3–1–1 in the UAA. The game ended with a score of 4–1.
“The team outlook is very positive right now,” said senior Ben Bryant, who took two of the team’s 17 shots on Friday. “We are feeling great about how we played yesterday against NYU. They are a solid team, and we were able to score four on them. We moved the ball very well, and had many scoring chances as a result.”
The Tartans put their first goal on the scoreboard at the 34-minute mark, when first-year midfielder Connor Webb made his first goal of his college career with an assist from junior forward Max Tassano. Just three minutes later, the Tartans increased the deficit to 2–0 when Bryant assisted a corner kick to junior defender Cole Christensen, who headed the ball in net for another goal.
Within the first 15 minutes of the second half, the Tartans scored again. Tassano finished this goal after a long throw from sophomore defender Jakob Rohwer. Before the halfway point in the second period, the Violets scored their first and only goal off a penalty kick.
The Tartans answered the Violets’ goal with a goal of their own just four minutes later, when sophomore forward Daniel Kursman-Neri finished an assist from Christensen.
The game’s conclusion left the Tartans to look forward to another UAA game against Emory University at home this Saturday.

The men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams put together excellent performances to open their seasons. The men’s team won three of four races, and the women’s team won all four at the University Athletic Association (UAA) Invite this past Friday and Saturday.
“This weekend was a pretty good weekend, being our first meet and all. It was a long weekend and the team had somewhat of a slow start, but we were able to finish strong as a team,” sophomore Cole Um said. “Overall the meet definitely helped bring the team closer together.”
In the men’s 200-yard medley relay, sophomores Anton Razanav and Um and juniors Terrence Wong and Eddie Sears finished second with a time of 1:37.86.
Razanav also took second in the 100-meter backstroke with a time of 54.41.
Senior Brandon Yee won first place in the 200-yard butterfly, and sophomore David Campbell took third. First-year Adam Pinson took fifth in the same event.
The men’s swimmers were consistently top-three finishers throughout the UAA Invite. In the 500-yard freestyle the Tartans grabbed second through fifth place, with first-year Steven Geier placing second with a time of 4:49.99.
On the women’s team, junior Soleil Phan led the Tartans with three individual victories on Saturday.
Phan took first in the 200-yard freestyle, the 100-yard freestyle, and the 400-yard IM. Her times were 1:56.38, 54.41, and 4:40.03, respectively. Additionally, she took first place twice in team events. She was on the team that placed first in the 400-yard medley relay, along with first-years Kira Singhaus, Felicia Wang, and Shieri Suzuka.
Phan was also on the squad that won the 200-yard medley relay, with Singhaus, Wang, and senior Breanna Stillo.
Singhaus was the victor in the 100-yard backstroke with a time of 1:00.43 and finished second in the 200-yard backstroke, losing only by 0.38 seconds.
“We had some amazing swims, and we are doing great for this point in the season, especially with a huge proportion of our team being new to the team and even new to the sport,” sophomore Wendy Liu said.
First-year Alicia Iott finished ninth for the Tartans in a diving event, scoring 134.20 points in the one-meter board event.
The men’s and women’s teams will compete again against Clarion University on Saturday at home. The meet begins at 11 a.m.

Despite dominating offensively, the Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team played to a 0–0 tie against New York University last Friday afternoon, putting the Tartans at a 3–1–1 University Athletic Association (UAA) conference record.
In the first half, the Tartans attempted five shots against the New York University Violets, all of which were blocked by the dominant Violet defense.
The Tartans continued their strong offensive effort as the team earned five corner kicks in the first eight minutes of the half. Players including senior defender Mitra Ebrahimi, sophomore forward Savina Reid, sophomore defender Lauren Simicich, and junior defender Rachel Contopoulos made attempts at goals.
Junior goalie Anna Albi had an excellent game, highlighted by a save on a header by New York University’s senior forward Serra Turmay during the 56th minute.
The Tartans continued with promising goal attempts into overtime, but the game was kept scoreless by New York University sophomore goalie Meg Patten.
At 92 minutes, junior forward Alex Venegas made a back pass to first-year forward Louisa Pendergast, but Patten dived to knock the ball away.
At 95 minutes, senior Brianna Magill made a last–ditch effort to score, but once again, Patten didn’t give her the chance.
“The team fought extremely hard against a talented New York University team,” senior midfielder Stephanie Hare said. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t get the ball in the back of the net. We are using our momentum to hopefully get a big win in our next game. The team is working really hard and fighting for each other every UAA battle.”
The Tartans will face tough UAA competition with their final in-season game at home this Saturday at 3 p.m., against currently undefeated Emory University.

Over the weekend, the Tartans traveled to Alliance, Oh., to play in a tri-match hosted by Mt. Union University. The Tartans finished the tournament with a 1–1 record after playing the No. 10 Raiders of Mt. Union and the Student Princesses of Heidelberg University. The Tartans’ overall record now stands at 14–16.
Carnegie Mellon opened the weekend with Mt. Union as its first opponent. The game was hard-fought, but the Raiders came out on top and won in three games. The scores of the three games were 23–25, 23–25, and 15–25, respectively.
The second match played by the Tartans was against Heidelberg University, which resulted in a Tartan victory. 
The match went to five games, where the Tartans won the first (25–22), third (27–25), and fifth (15–13). 
The offense was led by sophomore right side hitter Ali Celentano, who had 22 kills; junior outside hitter Senna Parsa, who had 16 kills; and junior outside hitter Rachel Miller, with 13 kills. The defensive highlight of the match came from junior libero Ali Nichols, who had 25 digs.
“We played as a team and worked really hard to focus on every point,” said senior defensive specialist Kasey LaMothe.
The Tartans have concluded their regular season play. The volleyball team will head to Atlanta, Ga., next week to play Case Western Reserve University in the University Athletic Association (UAA) Tournament Championships.
As a senior, it will be LaMothe’s last game in her career as a Tartan. Of it, LaMothe said, “I hope to make it a game worth remembering.”

One of Carnegie Mellon’s Ultimate Frisbee teams, Mr. Yuk, hit the road and traveled to Versailles, Oh., for the Fall Brawl tournament earlier this month. The Fall Brawl was the first tournament in which Carnegie Mellon split fully into an A team and a B team. Carnegie Mellon’s A team entered the Fall Brawl as the No. 1 seed.
Mr. Yuk faced Case Western Reserve University’s B team, Ohio Northern University, and Bluffton University, winning all three games on the first tournament day. Mr. Yuk only surrendered seven points throughout all three games and was able to play a large portion of its roster on the day.
Mr. Yuk was not seriously tested until it faced Ohio State University’s split squad team, which was largely composed of Ohio State’s A team. Mr. Yuk took a 10–5 lead, but let Ohio State crawl back to 11–10 before winning 12–10. Sophomore Reid Almand scored the final point with a nice layout grab off senior Ben McGrath.
The weather conditions on the second day of the tournament were rough, featuring 20 miles per hour winds. 
Mr. Yuk had a first round bye, with their first game against Case Western Reserve’s A team. After Mr. Yuk started strong, scoring four times straight, it let Case Western come right back, losing 8–7. However, Mr. Yuk came back to win in the end with a score of 9–8.
Mr. Yuk faced a less challenging test in the semifinals against the Wright State University squad. Mr. Yuk was victorious 9–5. This game featured entirely zone defense. 
In the finals, Mr. Yuk found itself facing Kenyon College in constant rain and strong winds, so the teams agreed to play to seven points. Mr. Yuk ended up breaking several times early to win 7–4. 
First-year Ross Ellison was the MVP of that game: He cleared two opponents for a Callahan, meaning he caught the disc in the other team’s end-zone.
“We came to the tournament with a few goals. We wanted to get our upperclassmen back and playing together after summer break,” said electrical and computer engineering master’s student Nipunn Koorapati. “We wanted our new players to show off. And we wanted to win the tournament. I’d say we did all three.” 
Mr. Yuk’s next tournament will be on Nov. 18, and will be hosted at home. The tournament will be a round robin against the University of Pittsburgh (2012 National Champions), Ohio University (2012 Nationals Qualifiers), Ohio State University, and Pennsylvania State University. The games will be played in Gesling Stadium and on the Intramural Fields.

The long grind of the baseball season is finally coming to a close with the San Francisco Giants and the Detroit Tigers facing off in the World Series. Although this matchup may not have the glamour of a New York Yankees versus Los Angeles Dodgers battle, it is certainly not lacking in excitement. With three Cy Young winners (Pitchers Barry Zito and Tim Lincecum for the Giants and Justin Verlander for the Tigers), one MVP (Verlander), and a triple crown winner (Detroit third baseman Miguel Cabrera), this series is full of talent, both on the mound and at the plate.
Both teams have faced uphill battles during the regular season. The Giants had all-star outfielder Melky Cabrera suspended for testing positive for performance enhancing drugs during a random drug test. At the time, he was leading the league in batting and led the core of the lineup. Lincecum, who came into this season as the Giants’ unquestionable ace, had a terrible season ending with an earned run average over five and being moved to the bullpen for part of the season and the playoffs.
The Tigers lost slugging catcher and first baseman Victor Martinez for the year to an ACL tear in January, prompting the managers to sign perennial all-star first baseman Prince Fielder. This signing forced Cabrera to move across the diamond to third base, causing previous starter Brandon Inge to be moved out of the lineup and weakening the Tigers defensively.
While each team needed all five games to make it out of its divisional series, the teams’ performance in the league championship series could not have been more different. The Tigers easily dispatched the slumping Yankees, sweeping them in four games to clinch the American League Pennant. The Giants, on the other hand, quickly fell behind 3–1 to the St. Louis Cardinals and were forced to win three straight games to move on. While the Tigers were at home resting, Giants players were fighting for their lives and, in the process, gaining momentum and confidence.
In Game 1 last Wednesday, the Tigers thought they had a surefire win with Verlander matching up against Zito, who has struggled since signing long term in San Francisco back in 2006. But Zito, with his array of excellent off-speed pitches, was the dominant pitcher, giving up only one run in five-and-two-thirds innings. Meanwhile, Verlander struggled, giving up five runs in only four innings, as San Francisco cruised to a 8–3 victory. Giants third baseman Pablo Sandoval had the game of his life, hitting three home runs in his first three at bats. He is the fourth player in World Series history to accomplish this feat.
Game 2 on Thursday appeared to be another win on paper for the Tigers, with struggling Giants pitcher Madison Bumgarner facing off against the Tigers’ Doug Fister. While both pitchers took shut outs into the seventh inning, the Giants again pulled out a 2–0 victory, scoring on a double play in the seventh and a Hunter Pence sacrifice fly in the eighth.
When the series moved from San Francisco to Detroit for Game 3 on Saturday, the Tigers hoped that the ridiculous luck that had been following the Giants would stay in the bay. Unfortunately for Detroit, the Giants pitching staff shut down the Tigers’ bats once again as San Francisco cruised to a 2–0 victory behind starter Ryan Vogelsong and relievers Lincecum and Sergio Romo. The Tigers were not without chances, but their struggling offense simply could not capitalize on their opportunities.
Overall, the Giants have both the momentum and the pitching matchups the rest of the way to close out the series after taking their commanding 3–0 series lead. Unless the Tigers can make history and win the next four games, San Francisco is going to win its second World Series in three years.

With the development of novel 3-D printed optics, magic comes to life at Carnegie Mellon inside the Disney Research Pittsburgh lab. 
Behind the closed doors of the Robert Mehrabian Collaborative Innovation Center, members of the Disney and Carnegie Mellon communities are conducting various projects and creating innovative technologies that would enhance the entertainment experience of Disney’s amusement parks.
Three-dimensional printing is a manufacturing process in which an object is created, or “printed,” one layer at a time. Using a printing liquid that cures quickly, the printer creates the object pass-by-pass per the desired geometry provided by a computer program. Even though 3-D printers were introduced in the ’80s, new technologies and reduced costs have allowed research to expand.
For example, multiple materials can be printed into one object. This property broadens the range of 3-D printing’s applications by increasing the level of complexity a printed structure can have.
The Disney Research website describes printed optics as, “A new approach to creating custom optical elements for interactive devices using 3-D printing.” Optics refers to the behavior and properties of light, and manipulating light is important to an entertainment company such as Disney. The uses  range from the experience someone gets walking through a room to an interactive digital display.
On the team researching printed optics are Karl D.D. Willis, a Ph.D. candidate in computational design; adjunct professor of architecture Eric Brockmeyer; Human-Computer Interaction Institute professor Scott E. Hudson; and Ivan Poupyrev, a Disney senior research scientist.
The researchers’ optical elements are printed from transparent plastic, and they use bubbles to manipulate light. Bubbles added inside the plastic during printing reflect light within the display to reveal internal patterns or text.
To direct light, the group developed light pipes, which resemble optical fibers. Because multiple materials allow one to create structures within structures, light pipes made from transparent plastics can be printed within the greater structure, and they offer a wider range in lighting displays than optical fiber can.
When describing the versatility 3-D printing has to offer, Willis said, “There’s really no other technology that...can make clear material that is arbitrary geometry and arbitrary shapes on the inside.”
The team used a toy with light-up and moving eyes as an example of this technology’s applications. By redirecting images projected in the toy’s base through its body, the team has created a light display in a children’s toy without LEDs, batteries, or circuits. This simplicity highlights another advantage of 3-D printing: Everything is printed in one piece, not made up of multiple parts.
A printed structure is still currently more expensive to produce than a similar product assembled from pieces. The researchers, however, stressed that the goal of this research is not about mass production, but about customization.
“We’re really not trying to compete with [commercial] technologies,” Brockmeyer said, “But sort of trying to realize what additive manufacturing can provide that is different from those manufacturing.”
In addition to manipulating the properties of light, their research involves utilizing light to give toys different capabilities. If pieces are inserted into the object mid-print, like an LED or infrared emitter/receiver pairs, the object can detect light in addition to refracting it. This ability allows the technology to expand to sensors.
The possibilities are far and wide — with its versatile and customizable nature, this technology surpasses traditional optics and is limited only by one’s imagination. Printed optics would make any geek agree with Disney: “Dreams do come true.”

How does an iPhone know when a finger touches its screen? It’s because the screen is capacitive, meaning that it has a little bit of electric current resting on its surface. When someone touches it, a tiny amount of current flows through that person’s body to the Earth, which makes the voltage on the screen surface drop. The iPhone observes this difference in voltage and realizes that a human must be touching it.
Chris Harrison, a Ph.D. student in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, has refined this technology in his research. He and his collaborators — Ivan Poupyrev of Disney Research and Munehiko Sato of the University of Tokyo — created a prototype of a capacitive sensor that can tell who is touching the screen. While normal capacitive screens might measure the draw of electricity at 1,000 Hz, this prototype measures the draw at many different frequencies — ranging from 1,000 to 3.5 million Hz. This creates a curve in real time representing the electrical properties of the person touching the screen.
The construction of the original capacitive sensor took two years to fully develop, followed by six months of research on person differentiation. The researchers tested their sensor on a group of 12 participants.
The researchers’ sensor samples the electrical properties of a human; these properties are influenced by “how dense your bones are, how much blood you have, how muscular you are, what kind of shoes you’re wearing,” Harrison said. After measuring these characteristics and learning from them, the sensor can use that to guess who the person is. Their research leverages the fact that electrical properties differ from person to person, but also from tissue to tissue.
“Your bones might have the lowest resistance at 12,000 Hz, but if you go to 15,000, there is higher resistance,” Harrison said.
For example, if you have a two-player game on a big touch screen, one player would draw in blue and the other would draw in red. The system would know who drew in what color without prior knowledge of the players and without them needing to identify themselves before each move. Undoing a move would also become easier. When a player clicks the undo button, his last move would be erased — not the global last move, which might belong to the other player.
Knowing who is touching the screen and when is a useful feature, especially for big surfaces. In the case of games that are on the same screen, capacitive sensing can keep individual score.
However, the system has not yet been perfected. A user could fool the system by trying to copy the curve representing the electrical properties of another person. “If you lift your foot off the ground and you touch something made of metal, you can trick the system so that your curve looks very similar to mine,” Harrison said.
When wearing thick boots, a user is going to look different than a user wearing light sneakers. While this is not good for security, the system looks for differentiation when two people come together to play a game on a tablet.
“You look different from me just enough that it would work for an hour,” Harrison said.
But sensing in the real world is more probabilistic than binary. Harrison believes he can combine his capacitive sensing method with computer vision, speech processing, and motion detection in order to get better accuracy. Any single sensing method might be 90 percent accurate, but when combined, they could be as accurate as 99 percent. 
This is the challenge for Harrison’s future research: making the system more robust, out of the lab and into the real world in phones and tablets. For this, more users and test cases are needed to completely understand how it performs. The user study the researchers conducted was not big, but it showed that the technology can work. “And that’s already a big contribution,” Harrison said.

One often hears of lie detectors being used to determine whether a suspect is providing an accurate account. The most people know is that the suspect is asked a series of questions and, by the end, the examiner studies the machine’s results and hypothesizes whether or not the answers were accurate. But what are the true mechanics of this machine?
Although it is a seemingly complex process for a machine to assess a complex array of human emotion and cognition based on a few responses, the mechanisms of a lie detector are relatively simple.
Lie detectors, also known as polygraphs, are most commonly used for criminal investigations or government-related job positions. The idea is to determine signs of lying by assessing the suspect’s physiological responses to a series of questions.
The examiner chooses from a variety of techniques to determine if the subject’s physiological reactions changed significantly or deviated from normal levels during the period of the test. The most common method examiners use is to ask suspects a series of multiple-choice questions, some of which only the criminal would know the answer to. During and after the test, examiners determine whether the suspect’s reactions changed significantly when asked these targeted questions.
Another method commonly used by examiners is assessing the suspect’s physiological reaction to a few simple, neutral questions at the beginning of the exam, and seeing whether their reactions to sensitive questions differ significantly. Similarly, examiners may ask the suspects to lie deliberately, so that the way they react may be compared to their reactions to questions asked later in the exam.
The last approach examiners use is alternating between asking the subject neutral as well as sensitive questions, assessing the fluctuation between their reactions.
To monitor physical reactions, sensors are attached to people taking the test to monitor their breathing rate, pulse, blood pressure, perspiration, and occasionally limb movements. Subjects’ reactions are recorded by the sensors and then graphed by needles on moving paper. In more modern versions of polygraphs, the same goal is achieved by advanced computer algorithms, which monitor these signs and then send the results to be graphed onto a digital screen.
While polygraphs are currently the most accessible means of determining whether or not a suspect is being truthful, the machine does have its drawbacks. It is important to recall that technology is deterministic — that is, it produces a certain result by going through a known series of steps.
Therefore, if a suspect is in fact a criminal and knows the workings of a lie detector, he or she can manipulate it so that it displays data to make answers seem truthful. Since increased sweat is often detected by the machine as an indicator of lying, one can use a strong antiperspirant to keep from sweating too much. One can also take a drug that lessens symptoms of stress, such as Valium, in order to give more measured responses. 
On the other hand, blood pressure medication can have adverse affects on the polygraph test. If the person taking the test takes this type of medication, the results could show a number of lies, even if he or she was telling the truth. Errors may also be made on an examiner’s end, because human emotions are, after all, unpredictable and may not be accurately portrayed by technology. 
Polygraphs are utilized in criminal thefts, national security matters, and even pre-employment screenings. So if you ever find yourself being tested by one, remember to stay calm, breathe, and answer honestly — whether it’s for your job or your alibi.

Newly discovered species of frog appears to lie
Conservation International announced the discovery of a new species of frog, nicknamed the “Pinocchio frog,” in the Foja Mountains of New Guinea. This lost-world amphibian was found by Paul Oliver, a herpetologist at the University of Adelaide, who happened to spot one perched on a bag of rice at the campsite during a downpour. 
The Pinocchio frog’s  nose is noted to stand up when the frog is excited, and droop down otherwise. Other functions of the Pinocchio frog’s nose remain unknown.

American Lung Association creates air pollution app
The American Lung Association (ALA) introduced its new “State of the Air” app, available for both iPhone and Android, which also connects to Twitter and Facebook. This app informs residents of the air quality in their living area for following days, as well as of the danger of the air pollution and ozone levels that occupy nearby areas.
It depicts a character with the name Alvin Grimes collecting air particles in jars as a way to influence users to think about the particles they collect in their own lungs. Norman Edelman, chief medical officer of the ALA, said that over 40 percent of Americans live in areas where pollution continues to be a threat.

Neurobiologist studies singing mice
Scientists discovered that mice can sing, similar to dolphins and songbirds. Enrich Jarvis, a neurobiologist at Duke University, stated that mice have more similarities with humans in vocal communication than with any other species. Jarvis verified that mice did not have brain connections to pick up new songs by conducting experiments that involved destroying mice’s motor controls.
In the future, Jarvis plans to study how genes affect vocalization in mice and brain structure to determine its similarities of that to humans and songbirds. Jarvis’ ultimate question lies in whether mice can sing better than songbirds can.

Dinosaurs may have used feathers for mating
Paleontologists looking at Canadian dinosaur fossils discovered in 1995 believe that the juvenile ornithomimus had feathers.
The dinosaur still did not have the ability to fly, and the exact purpose of the feathers remains unknown. As the feathers are only found on adults, some scientists speculate they may have been used for reproductive purposes. 
“The idea is that these were for communication,” said bird expert Richard Prum of Yale University. The new findings were published in the journal Science.

Scientists one-up nature with synthetic solar cell
Researchers, led by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Daniel Nocera, have produced an advanced solar cell in the shape of a leaf that is 10 times more efficient at carrying out photosynthesis than a natural cell is. The cell has catalytic materials on both sides, and needs no external wires or control circuits.
When placed in a container of water under sunlight, the cell produces oxygen bubbles from one side and hydrogen bubbles from the other. Both of these are collected to produce energy if the cell is placed in a container that separates the two sides. The cell itself is composed of widely available materials such as silicon, cobalt, and nickel.

[BOLD]**Ozone Hole Smallest Size in Decades**[BOLD] 
Scientists have determined that the hole in the ozone layer reached its smallest maximum extent in two decades. The ozone layer, which protects the Earth from UV light, thins during late September and early October; this year’s largest reported hole was 21.2 million square kilometers. 
The hole in the ozone layer is created by frigid temperatures and reactions between chlorine and man-made chlorofluorocarbon gases. Scientists say that the shrinking of the hole can be attributed to warmer Antarctic temperatures from changing weather.

Once upon a time, the Carnegie Mellon School of Music whisked audiences into a magical show that twisted traditional fairy tales into a new story. This show, Stephen Sondheim’s Into the Woods, was presented last Thursday through Sunday in the Philip Chosky Theater in the Purnell Center for the Arts.
As always, the university’s talented students gave an amazing performance. Taking place during National Opera Week, the show went above and beyond the call of duty, relying not just on plot to draw viewers in.
Before the story was able to engage the audience, the set and costumes had already blown minds across the theater. The staging went far beyond the sets of many professional productions that theater-goers pay more than $80 to attend. Dominic Missimi, the visiting director and former director of musical theater at Northwestern University, chose to set the show in an attic, stuffed full with antique artifacts around which the story twisted and twined.
Rather than being over dramatic and taking away from the story as some wardrobes tend to do, the costumes complemented the story and characters, but remained visually interesting at the same time. The overall effect was a veritable feast for the eyes to enjoy while the ears were simply ringing with the skilled voices of the students.
The basic idea behind the musical’s genius plot is that there’s more to those beloved fairy tales than what we learned as children. The more generic characters of the baker (junior vocal performance major James Alexander) and his wife (junior vocal performance major Chloe Holgate) were joined by characters from childhood favorites: Cinderella, played by vocally angelic junior vocal performance and psychology double major Chelsea Ritenour; Jack from Jack in the Beanstalk, played by somehow simultaneously obnoxious and charming junior vocal performance major Nigel Rowe; and Little Red Riding Hood, played by junior vocal performance major Hannah Marks. These characters all recklessly make wishes that they believe will make them happier in the end, and the show describes their journey to the fulfillment of their wishes.
Along the way, of course, there are many obstacles to overcome, each accompanied by award-winning songs and important lessons to be learned. All of these twists and turns are narrated by a mysterious man (junior music composition major Sean Salamon) and agitated by the glittering and captivating witch (junior vocal performance major Olivia Vadnais). 
Into the Woods includes all the elements of a classic fairy tale, with a few dark surprises and many magical moments. Who doesn’t love a fairy tale reworked into something new and just as magical? When the costumes and staging are as tempting as a red poison apple and the voices and instrumentation are sweeter than a love song from Disney, you can’t possibly go wrong.
This show was the hidden gem of the week here on campus. Cast as the diamond in the rough in the hullabaloo surrounding Scotch’n’Soda’s Reefer Madness, Into the Woods was a deliciously dark, whimsical, and thrilling ride through the fairy tales of childhood. Bravo, and may the cast members live happily ever after knowing that they performed a captivating tale.

AB Coffeehouse’s annual Halloween dance party featured electronic hip-hop artist RL Grime along with Sensitivity and Naan Naan, a DJ duo composed of senior business administration major and WRCT general manager Alex Price and School of Art alumnus and WRCT DJ Naeem Martinez-White. Despite taking some time to start, both the Carnegie Mellon DJ duo and RL Grime were successful in bringing Rangos to life.
This year’s party took place in Rangos Hall on Friday night and lasted from 8 p.m. to a bit after the planned 11 p.m. The original program featured L.A.-based glitch-hop DJ Shlohmo to perform with RL Grime, but Shlohmo cancelled his appearance in advance of Friday’s concert. 
The party was free with Carnegie Mellon student ID and $10 without, but a quick look in Rangos confirmed that almost all attendees were students. Although the party was Halloween-themed, attempts to put this into effect were somewhat weak. A plastic skull filled with candy was the only sign of the holiday in sight.
After opening sets by DJ Salem (sophomore computer science major Salem Hilal) and DJ ReBase (junior information systems major Steve McQuaid), Sensitivity and Naan Naan presented back-to-back sets of deep, enchanting house music, occasionally lightened with a touch of more upbeat techno rhythms. The DJ set was accompanied by a truly mesmerizing laser show consisting of multicolored beams that shot through Rangos and danced around on the back wall to the rhythm of the techno house beats. The DJs themselves also contributed to the Halloween-based theme of the evening by sporting unidentifiable yet intimidating masks throughout their set.
Unfortunately, the first set wasn’t attended by many people. Through the first few songs, the dance floor was almost entirely empty and the few people that had already arrived lingered in the corners of the ballroom that the stage lights didn’t reach. However, this was not representative of the quality of the duo’s music, who put together an amazing show overall. The quality of the show was confirmed toward the end of the set, when the dance floor was occupied by more than 30 students, zombies, a mosh pit, and even a few Japanese anime characters.
Sensitivity and Naan Naan handed the stage over to RL Grime around 9:30 p.m. The Los Angeles-based DJ is known for his innovative approach to electronic music, marrying conventional electronic dance music with bass-driven hip-hop, a style often described as trap. Indeed, a change in frequency was obvious when RL Grime took the stage: His music’s gradual transformation in beats, culminating in floor-vibrating bass tones, was reminiscent of dubstep drops.
However, RL Grime’s music went a bit further than simple dubstep “wobble.” Drops were followed by loops from hip-hop songs with amplified bass, and beats were more disjointed. His music was more successful than the first set in bringing the audience to life, but this was also due to the fact that the audience had grown by this time. The musical experience could have only been amplified by a better sound system, which may have let listeners feel the music’s bass to its full extent.
RL Grime put on a great set: He controlled the crowd, making it hold its collective breath in anticipation of an arriving bass drop and completely let go in an animalistic fashion once the bass had spread. The quality of music provided by Sensitivity and Naan Naan and RL Grime in this year’s Halloween party was, without question, impeccable.
The party as a whole, however, could have been taken out of the typical concert mold. As a Halloween party and not simply a show, more effort toward the nonmusical aspects of the evening would have made Friday night a true Halloween experience. Such effort would not only have made the event more of an actual party than solely a concert, but it also might have attracted a larger audience.

“Commie reefer queens want your kids.”
Statements like this, painted on the set and often voiced by actors, were the driving satire behind Scotch’n’Soda’s first production of the school year, Reefer Madness, which played last Thursday through Saturday in McConomy Auditorium.
The musical, based loosely on the 1936 propaganda exploitation film Tell Your Children, is terribly silly. The script is awful. It’s no Les Misérables — but it’s not supposed to be. In essence, Reefer is a political commentary on the ridiculousness of ’30s drug policy and radical conservatives who believed that marijuana was a more debilitating and addictive drug than heroin. Indeed, Reefer could have focused on meth rather than on marijuana; it would make much more sense, but wouldn’t be nearly as funny.
It makes one wonder what the makers of the 1936 movie were using when they were filming — considering the time period, probably cocaine.
Reefer’s first-time director, sophomore electrical and computer engineering and creative writing double major Bradley Plaxen, chose a great production that naturally caters to a college crowd. It was definitely sloppy at some points; the stage blackouts seemed nearly random, and the final scene’s choreography had the actors practically tripping over each other. But the actors’ tangible enthusiasm and the bombastic musical numbers more than made up for any mishaps.
The audience would have lost interest without the enthralling opening number. The scene’s choreography, the brainchild of sophomore design major Sam Ahmed, was the best in the entire show: The ensemble’s fantastic, “marijuana-induced” dancing engaged audience members early on, daring them to hope for more.
And more they did receive, although not right away. Protagonist Jimmy Harper (first-year Dietrich student Zach Stuckelman) had a frog in his throat until he smoked his first joint, after which he sang 10 times better. Interestingly enough, the opposite was true for his girlfriend, Mary Lane (first-year Dietrich student Emma Harger), who played her goody-two-shoes role well, but seemed stuck in that persona, even when she had to strip to her garters onstage and dominate unsuspecting marijuana dealer Ralph Wiley (sophomore vocal performance major Taylor Rawley).
While all the actors in Reefer Madness had substantial talent, there are a few who shined above the rest. Senior economics and statistics and decision science double major Will Weiner had sobering comments and straight-arrow acting that kept the show grounded. Rawley expertly played his college reefer junkie role, dominating the stage with his high-pitched giggling and lascivious nature.
Possibly the most outstanding presence was sophomore vocal performance major Joanna Latini as the conflicted Mae Coleman, who owns the reefer den run by her husband, Jack Perry (junior math major Billy Veer). Unable to choose between her addiction and her morals, she is the only character with whom the audience was able to empathize, and she navigates her frequent transitions from guilty addict to comic reinforcement seamlessly. Veer is a great actor, but dancing was his forte, especially his duo with Placard Girl (first-year computer science major Gail Wilson, also the production’s dance captain). Other choreography highlights included “Murder!”, the reprise of “Down at the Ol’ Five and Dime,” and “Listen to Jesus, Jimmy.”
It’s hard to imagine Reefer Madness succeeding anywhere but on a college campus, and it fit right in at Carnegie Mellon. While probably not the best production Scotch’n’Soda has put together, it was ludicrously entertaining and should have been a required Halloween festivity for every student.

Looking at the panel members at the “Pocketful of Prose” reading and discussion last Thursday in the Steinberg Auditorium, one immediately noticed the differences between the three writers sitting at the table.
Amina Gautier, a fiction writer and winner of the Flannery O’Connor Award for Short Fiction, sat at one end, looking polished and poised in a pencil dress. Kim Dana Kupperman, author of the award-winning essay collection I Just Lately Started Buying Wings, relaxed at the other end, swaddled in long, flowing layers. Between them sat Stewart O’Nan — prolific novelist, Pittsburgh resident, and moderator for the panel — wearing a worn-looking Pirates hat and chatting cheerily with audience members.
As it turned out, the writers and their works were as different from each other as their appearances would suggest, making for an interesting reading and an engaging panel discussion.
After associate professor of English Jane McCafferty briefly introduced the speakers, O’Nan began the evening by reading from The Night Country, in which two teenagers grapple with their lives after surviving a car crash that killed three of their friends. The novel, which O’Nan dedicated to Ray Bradbury, is narrated from the ghostly perspective of one of the dead friends; it’s fitting, then, that the writing style swirls dreamily as the narrator swoops through the suburban town and eventually makes his way back to the scene of the accident to recall it.
Kupperman followed by reading an essay called “Tell Me How Long the Train’s Been Gone: A Letter to James Baldwin on the 25th Anniversary of His Passing.” The essay, which she recently wrote for submission to the Hunger Mountain literary journal, addresses everything from environmentalism to racism, from American imperialism to this month’s presidential debates. Although the essay is loosely tied together around a train ride she takes from New York to Pennsylvania, it mostly feels didactic and heavy-handed as it lists off the author’s opinions.
Gautier, who received both her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in four years at Stanford University and is now an associate professor at DePaul University, then read “Push,” a short story from her book At-Risk. In the story, a young girl at an overcrowded inner-city elementary school is forced by her teacher to reflect on the reasons why she picks on a fellow student. “Push” takes a narrow slice of time and uses it to give a lovely, lyrical glimpse into a young girl’s life.
Afterward, O’Nan led the panel discussion, during which the speakers delved into conversations on the short story format, the distinction between literary fiction and genre fiction, and the ways that authors can play with genre conventions.
The writers’ differences worked to the discussion’s advantage: All of the writers were intelligent and well versed in literature, yet all had very different perspectives and opinions. The result was a lively and interesting conversation. O’Nan, in particular, made for a great moderator: Whenever Kupperman began to dominate the conversation, he would gently ease it back on track. Even though the conversation could have easily drifted off in an intellectually inaccessible direction, O’Nan’s down-to-earth approach kept the discussion engaging for the audience.
The conversation was interesting enough that an hour and a half easily flew by. The discussion could have continued on, but McCafferty regretfully announced that she would have to end the discussion, as it was getting late and there was pizza waiting in the Gladys Schmitt Creative Writing Center. The small audience clapped loudly for the panelists, and trundled up the stairs to wrap up an evening of great writing and great conversation.

Dear Patrick,
I’ve been hanging out with this girl quite a bit lately. I want to go out with her, but she treats me like one of her girlfriends. I’ll feel like I’m making progress, but then she’ll mention some dude she’s into who isn’t me. I thought I made my intentions clear, but I guess not. What should my next move be?
Thanks,
Girl Acquaintance Largely Platonic, Amour Lacking
Dear GAL PAL,
If I were a lesser advice columnist, I’d talk to you about how you’ve been forced into the “friend zone.” Lucky for you, I’m not. See, that’s just something guys (and a few girls) say so they can blame all their problems on women. “You don’t want to go out with me? You’re just emotionally manipulating me to make yourself feel better!” Just stop it, guys; you’re making us all look bad.
You say you’ve made your intentions clear, but maybe you haven’t. Try to see if she’s into you. Although, frankly, it sounds to me like she’s not. If you’re unconvinced, then you could explicitly ask her out on a date. Looks like all you’ve done is make a new friend. How horrible. I know, it’s surprising, but you can be friends with women without trying to date them. You’re not in middle school anymore. It’s cool to be friends with girls.
Lady friends make the best wingmen,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I missed the partying last week, but I want to put together a Halloween costume for this week without buying anything. Do you have any tips for a cheap, simple, and clever costume?
Thanks,
Creative Outfit Sought Tonight, Uncomplicated Manufacturing Entertaining Disguise
Dear COSTUMED,
How much you like my costume ideas will depend on how much you like puns. If you hate them, then just go ahead and put on a scarf and go as a hipster, because you’re lame and don’t like awesome things like puns. But for my pun-loving brethren, I have plenty of ideas.
Get a raggedy costume, some safety pins, and a bunch of sponges. Pin them to the shirt. If anyone asks, you’re “self-absorbed.” Wear a pair of sunglasses and carry around roses — a “blind date.” Have a bra and some spices? Make like an insecure middle-schooler and stuff! You’re a “spice rack.” Brown robe and a bag of Fritos? “Chip monk.” Cover a box of cereal in red paint and carry around a fake knife with some paint on it too. You’re a “cereal killer.” I’ll stop now; I’m sure your sides hurt from laughing so much. Thank me later.
Ha ha! Blind date,
Patrick Hoskins

It’s that time of year again. Your Facebook is flooded with invitations to Halloween parties, slasher fests, pumpkin patch frolicking, nights of horror — the list goes on. Yet upon attending these events, you are overwhelmed with downright bad costumes and a lack of Halloween spirit.
Invitations to these events include descriptions that tell girls to be whatever they want, as long as they add the word “slutty” to the costume description. Now, I’m all for expressing yourself, but what happened to good, clean Halloween fun that focused on ghouls, goblins, and witches instead of sexy nurses, teachers, and police officers?
This past week, I went to an event that embodied my idealized image of Halloween. Tucked away in Lawrenceville, Arsenal Bowling Lanes hosts a weekly college night on Tuesdays, complete with cheap bowling, booze, and a live band. This week, the bowling alley was decked out with skeletons, cobwebs, and the usual Halloween fare. The red velvet walls, the skeletons atop the alleyways, and the live band made for a great evening.
The band, aptly called The Graveyard Rockers, played psychobilly and surf rock tunes focused on zombies, Frankenstein, and all your favorite monsters. The tongue-in-cheek references to science fiction, horror, violence, and sex were quite a relief from the bevy of electronic dance music I’d grown accustomed to hearing during “Halloween” parties.
As soon as Thanksgiving comes, our ears will be assaulted with Christmas music; why isn’t this the case with Halloween music? If you dig around, you’ll find that there are some great Halloween anthems out there that bring together the dark, fun, and ultimately over-sexualized aspects of Halloween. Take a break from your usual playlists and crank up some psychobilly. I would recommend you start with the compilations Halloween Hootenanny and Halloween A Go-Go.

Men in Black 3
8 10 12
Men in Black has been one of the most reliably solid science fiction franchises of the 21st century. Unafraid to use comedy as an engine rather than as a decoration, all three installments have settled comfortably into their own skins. The stories concern a secret government agency tasked with dispatching hostile, covert alien presences in America. It's an ingenious setup that has been carried out with aplomb. In this third installment, Josh Brolin joins Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as Jones' character's younger self and, with the help of a slick script, gives a dynamite performance. Men in Black 3 is every bit as exciting and fresh as the original.
Men in Black
8 10 12
Men in Black is a game-changing science fiction checkpoint. Most current blockbuster sci-fi owes some genealogical debt to Men in Black. It's a smooth, clean, funny, and thrilling spectacle. We've been wading knee-deep in maudlin superhero franchises since Chris Nolan ruined Batman; Men in Black comes off as a more refreshing and tighter film than most of the current bombastic Hollywood product. It's impossible to find a sci-fi script so comfortable in comedy and so illuminated by performance.
Iron Sky
8 10 12
AB Films is dishing out a special screening of this ridiculous German-Finnish-Australian spectacle. Iron Sky shows us a 2018 where, after spending decades on the moon, the Nazis return to Earth for vengeance. You won't find this on Netflix or DVD anytime soon, so be sure to come by for this exclusive screening.

Carnegie Mellon students may see an increase in their activities fee in the near future. On Thursday, Student Body Vice President for Finance Jon Mark announced via email that he is proposing a $24 increase in the semesterly student activities fee that would go into effect at the beginning of the next academic year.
Mark, a senior lighting design major, will bring the matter up for a special election on Nov. 8. If the student body votes in favor of the increase, Mark will recommend to the Carnegie Mellon Board of Trustees, which sets the student activities fee, that the fee be raised.
The proposed fee increase would affect all Carnegie Mellon students, undergraduate and graduate. The fee would increase from $97 per semester to $121, a 25 percent increase. However, the election is a split referendum, meaning that the votes of graduate students and those of undergraduate students are counted separately. In addition, both Mark and Student Body President Will Weiner said they intend to recommend raising the fee only for students on the Pittsburgh campus; until now, students in Qatar have always had to pay the same fee.
“The desire is to have the will of the students be represented to the Board of Trustees and hope that there’s not a bureaucratic problem,” said Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno. “Does it create some technology problems in terms of from a systems standpoint and implementation from the registrar’s office, etc.? Certainly it’s easier if everyone gets to assess the fee and gets exactly the same. Easier, absolutely. But we can handle that difference.”
Mark campaigned last semester on a platform of raising the fee. He wrote in his official platform, “The student activities fee should be increased to reflect the growing need of student organizations.... Through good advertising and education, I am confident the student body will see value in the increase for this fee.”
The student activities fee is distributed annually by the Joint Funding Committee (JFC) to recognized student organizations.
Mark, who sits at the head of the JFC, believes that a fee increase is necessary in order to counteract a growing disparity between the funds requested by student organizations and funds granted — in particular, Mark said, between the revenue that JFC expects organizations to raise for themselves, and the amount that organizations are actually able to raise.
“We really started seeing that revenue expectations were really high,” Mark said.
Weiner, a senior economics and statistics and decision science double major, said that he has been a proponent of raising the fee since his time as Undergraduate Student Senate chair.
“It’s an issue I think that is pretty important to students, and I wanted to make sure ... to give the students an opportunity to actually vote and see if this issue that we see as a problem [is one] students agree with,” Weiner said.
According to Weiner, student government has been looking into other ways of solving the funding problem, such as tightening the requirements for funding student groups. But Weiner feels that raising the student activities fee is the only viable long-term solution.
“A part of the big problem is that groups have been cutting back on lots of things,” he said. “Spring break trips aren’t being funded at all right now. These were things that we couldn’t think of a way to fund at all. The only real solution to it is more money, at this point.”
Mark, in turn, stressed the qualitative effect a fee increase would have on groups. “I meet with probably close to seven organizations a week. And just hearing about how they don’t have enough and how the system doesn’t work for them in certain ways, that’s what drives me to know that I need to overhaul this process.”
Students in funded organizations have been guardedly positive about the idea of an increase.Ivy Krislov, a junior technical writing and creative writing double major and head of finance for readme, said, “We’re only getting money to put out the minimum number of issues that we would normally put out. We have very limited funds for anything else, and we’re expanding this year, so we have been mincing around trying to find money to do things.”
“Our student activities fee isn’t that expensive this year, so [a raise] would probably be worth it, just so that we could expand the opportunities people can offer to students,” Krislov added.
Timothy Bach, a senior computer science major and operations director for Carnegie Mellon EMS, believes our current student activities fee is fairly low, and that in order for our school to focus on providing a well-rounded education, it should place emphasis on supporting student activities.
“If we are intelligent about how we spend our JFC money, I think raising that fee will allow our students to do better things: to go to more conferences, to travel more, to learn more, to broaden their horizons, and I think that is critical,” Bach said. “I, like many other students, obviously do not want to pay more money, but I think that this is one of the areas where it is worth it.”
However, Bach said that because he categorizes Carnegie Mellon EMS as a campus service, he does not believe that all of the club’s funding should be derived from Student Activities. “Because we’re a campus service, we get the majority of our money from campus affairs. We get money from JFC and SDC to cover gaps in our budget for things like upgrading our infrastructure and buying required things like uniforms. I think that the purpose of JFC is to encourage students to do things outside of class,” he said.
Tetyana Dolotova, H&SS interdisciplinary senior and president of Ballroom Dance Club, said that she would support an increase in the student activities fee if the change was minimal. “I would not want to run our club as an inconvenience to the student body, but if it’s a subtle increase that other students won’t really notice, then I would [support it],” Dolotova said.
With the extra funding, Dolotova said her club would use the money to get Activities Board lighting and host bigger events. “We hire professional dance instructors, and they charge a high fee for their services, and we also have a competition team — we have to pay to have them attend competitions,” she said.
Shilpa Balaji, a senior computer science major and president of Mock Trial, said, “The thing with the student activities fee is that a lot of that money goes to clubs that the people providing that fee aren’t necessarily a part of. Do I really want to be giving money to organizations that I will never see a benefit from — or to a cause that I don’t necessarily support? I think it could be good, but any kind of extremely large raise, I might have issues with.”
The special election will run from Nov. 8 to Nov. 10. Mark will hold two town hall meetings to discuss the fee: one this Wednesday at 5 p.m. in Rangos 1, and one on Nov. 6 at 5 p.m. in the Danforth Lounge.
Editor’s note: Check back next week for the second part in The Tartan’s continuing series on the student activities fee.

Carnegie Mellon students voting on campus Nov. 6 will have the opportunity to cast their ballots in two local political races: one for a House of Representatives member and one for a Pennsylvania Senate seat.
The following breakdowns are intended to provide a basic outline for the two main candidates running for these positions so students voting will be able to make an informed decision. 
The incumbent candidates and their challengers are described below, with an outline of their basic experience, campaign focus, and stances on key issues.
House
Students will be able to vote for the representative for Pennsylvania’s 14th district. The two challengers vying for a spot in the House of Representatives this year are incumbent Democrat Mike Doyle and Republican Hans Lessmann.
A ninth-term congressman, Doyle is a graduate of Pennsylvania State University with a bachelor’s in community development. Doyle previously served as the Chief of Staff for state Senator Frank Pecora.
Doyle’s campaign is framed around high-tech development for the Western Pennsylvania region.
According to Doyle’s website, “Congressman Doyle has been working aggressively on the Energy and Commerce Committee to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil supplies through the development of new, more energy-efficient technology and alternative and renewable sources of energy. He is also actively involved in efforts to draft energy policies that will halt global warming without destroying or outsourcing American jobs.”
Doyle currently serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and is a member of the subcommittee on Communications and Technology, as well as the Energy and Power subcommittee.
Doyle has a voting record against the Iraq war, is consistent with pro-choice views, and is in support of President Barack Obama’s economic stimulus efforts.
Challenger Lessmann’s campaign is focused on job creation in Western Pennsylvania, and promises to achieve this through a decrease in taxation and government interference in business operations.
Lessmann’s website opens with the declaration, “The people deserve competition,” and states, “The ‘Steel City’ has been left behind under the uncontested rein of Mike Doyle. While the rest of the country has grown, we have stagnated or declined. As the most livable city, we have much untapped potential, yet Mike Doyle’s leadership has failed. We should be attracting people, tourism, nonprofits, research, businesses, and corporations. Our children should not leave home for jobs.”
Lessmann graduated from Purdue University and the Pennsylvania College of Optometry, and recently aligned himself with the Tea Party by speaking at Western Pennsylvania Tea Party events.
Lessmann said in an article in The Wall Street Journal that the recent health care act is “offensive and disrespectful to the Constitution.” 
Senate
This year’s U.S. Senate race in Pennsylvania is between incumbent Democrat Bob Casey, Jr. and Republican Tom Smith.
Casey, who defeated incumbent Republican Senator Rick Santorum in 2006, attended the College of the Holy Cross and received a law degree from the Columbus School of Law at the Catholic University of America. Casey is running on an economic platform. “To spur growth in Pennsylvania’s life sciences industry, Senator Casey introduced the Life Sciences Jobs and Investment Act to promote innovation and job creation in life sciences research and development,” according to his website.
Casey supported Obama’s health care act and voted for the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” He is in favor of nondiscrimination legislation for the LGBT community.
Casey was a co-sponsor of the Stop Online Piracy Act, which drew substantial criticism due to accusations of it giving the government power for internet censorship.
His opponent this fall is Republican Tom Smith, who plans to simplify the tax code by instituting a flat tax and closing loopholes. He also wants to reduce annual federal spending to 20 percent of the gross domestic product.
He campaigned to end the regulation that he says “suffocates growth and kills jobs,” according to his website.
Smith, who postponed college to run his family farm, worked in the coal industry in Pennsylvania, and wants to bring his business experience in a highly regulated industry into the political arena.
Smith’s effective advertising gained him a great deal of attention, especially the advertisements that cast Casey as “Candidate Zero,” altering the Obama campaign’s “O” logo to be a zero.
Despite these two races being dominated by candidates from the country’s main parties, students willing to be interviewed about their voting plans all expressed displeasure with the limited choice in mainstream candidates.
Sophomore mathematics major Arun Ramakrishnan said, “Personally, I don’t really support either of the candidates. If I did vote I would vote independent, but that wouldn’t count.”
Andrew Schwartz, a sophomore information systems major, is also frustrated by the inability of independent candidates to win elections. “I am voting, but not for a major party candidate,” he said. “I hope that the candidate that loses does so by a margin equal to the population that didn’t vote for a major party candidate, so the party realizes that their views were too extreme.”
Stanley Krasner, sophomore economics and mathematics major, will not vote. “In my current situation as an economics student, I feel that my vote in this election will not be as educated now as it will four years from now,” he said. “I feel that I should gain more knowledge before voting for something as important as our nation’s next leader.”

Writer Melinda Hemmelgarn gave a talk at Carnegie Mellon on Wednesday as part of Campus Sustainability and Food Day. The talk focused on the choices that consumers make with regards to their food.
Carmegie Mellon’s Campus Sustainability and Food Day celebrated “sustainability and the movement towards ‘more healthy, affordable and sustainable food,’ ” according to a university press release.
Hemmelgarn’s talk was the main event of Food Day. According to Hemmelgarn, consumers should not only think of the final form of the food they eat, but also where it came from, how it was made, and at what cost it was produced.
Sarah Kuethe, sophomore political science and sociology double major at the University of Pittsburgh, said the talk related to students since they have unique food concerns. 
“As students, we don’t have many choices with food,” Kuethe said.
Hemmelgarn addressed several aspects of food consumption, production, and marketing: water, chemicals, label lingo, autism, environment, policy, food safety, farmers, and healthcare. One of the main lessons of her talk was what makes food “good.” 
Hemmelgarn said good food is tasty, environmentally safe, produced humanely, accessible to all, safe from chemicals, seasonal, and regional.
“Food has to be safe and it has to taste good. Who wants to eat if it doesn’t taste good?” Hemmelgarn said. “It has to be produced humanely, and that means from the animals all the way up to the people.” 
She said the workers who plant and pick food need to be treated well. If they are treated poorly, then the food is “not good food.”
In her talk, Hemmelgarn also explained the difference between organic and natural food. 
She warned the audience to “be careful of the lingo” on packages.
“Organic is extremely different from natural,” Hemmelgarn said. “Organic has a strong federal regulation in terms on what it can be and what it can’t be. Natural? Very weak. No legal definitions, really; the FDA has one food definition, the [U.S. Department of Agriculture] has another.”
During her talk, Hemmelgarn said that consumers should wait to buy organic foods until they’re in season locally.
“Good food is seasonal and regional when it can be,” Hemmelgarn said. “There’s something better about a strawberry that you waited for. We can always get strawberries in February. They’re everywhere. But is that sustainable? And I would argue that they’re not as delicious.”
Later, Hemmelgarn continued, “The gold standard is local, organic. The problem is that we import a lot. So [consider] an organic pepper that’s [not] sprayed, but it’s coming from the Dominican Republic. It’s good that there are no harmful chemicals being used in the Dominican Republic, but we have to consider the fuel that’s used to bring this pepper here. So maybe just wait another month or two, and then you’ll have peppers that are local.”
When asked about how that could potentially negatively affect the economics of the country exporting food for money, Hemmelgarn said, “I think it’s important for countries to be food secure and to be able to feed themselves.”
Jessica Owens, the supervisor of supplemental instruction in Excel programs at Carnegie Mellon, said that she thought the talk “aligned with a lot of initiatives” at the university. 
Owens said she would take away Hemmelgarn’s “encouragement to do more critical thinking” about food and apply it to life.
“I think it’s important to be a part of the food system,” said London Depaule, a graduate student at Chatham University. Depaule worked for a nonprofit where he encountered people who didn’t have easy access to food. 
“I don’t think you’ll know what it’s like unless you live in that situation,” Depaule said. Of the talk, he said that he thought it was “a call to action” for students.
“We have to rethink food access, and I’d like to ask the question: Why can’t people get to good food?” Hemmelgarn said. “I don’t care whether you’re in a prison, or a day care, a school, or where you are in the class system.... Everyone deserves good food.”
“I think it’s so important to eat organically and recognize that, while cheap is good, it’s bad in the long run,” Suvi Gluskin, a senior in the Bachelor of Humanities and Arts program said. “I hope CMU incorporates more organic sustainable practices.”

Students gathered for a student panel discussion to address diversity within the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math  (STEM) as part of “A Celebration of Diversity in STEM” last Wednesday.
The panel was held in the Gates Hillman Complex and was hosted by organizations including Women@SCS, the Society of Women Engineers, the National Society of Black Engineers, and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers.
Panelists responded to questions from the audience about their experiences as minorities in their respective STEM fields. 
The panel featured four Carnegie Mellon students: Ph.D. candidate in chemical engineering Sharon M. Vuong, Ph.D. candidate in human-computer interaction Tawanna Dillahunt, senior computer science and math double major Adrian Trejo Nuñez, and Ph.D. candidate in information systems Edward McFowland III.
Because the speakers were involved in outreach programs intended to give young minority students more opportunities, the panelists focused on the power of education on minorities.
McFowland volunteers for a program called Pittsburgh Science and Technology, which allows middle  and high school students to participate in lessons in science and technology fields.
“I think young black men face a lot of challenges....The problems that resonate with me are the problems of young black men, and I think that, unfortunately, educated black men are an endangered species,” he said. “I want to be an example, as well as provide a haven for exploring these things.”
Vuong talked about her experience teaching at the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Talented Elementary and Secondary Students, C-MITES. She elaborated on the stereotypes that pressure young girls into avoiding engineering.
“There’s a slight stigma to being really girly, and some of them like being girly, and don’t really identify with engineering at all,” she said.
Vuong cited her own experience; when she applied to college, she originally intended to study professional ballet, but ultimately chose to become a chemical engineer.
All of the panelists admitted to noticing a lack of minority teachers and professors throughout their high school and college careers.
Dillahunt said that “having a minority professor by itself encourages students to stay in school.”
Trejo Nuñez said, “For kids growing up that makes a difference too; they think ‘well, maybe I can’t be an educator,’ even though they’d be good at it, but seeing someone in that role, that could change it.” As a Hispanic and the only computer scientist in his high school graduating class, Trejo Nuñez plans to return to his hometown to encourage students to pursue STEM fields.
Carol Frieze, the organizer of the event and director of Women@SCS, said that the number of women involved in engineering and computer science has decreased in recent years. Frieze emphasized the importance of having a diverse student body, especially in STEM. “The President [of the U.S.] says diversity makes university and education healthier for everybody,” she said.
Jose Morales, a researcher from the Software Engineering Institute who helped organize the event, said, “Just because you’re diverse, it doesn’t make you different in a weird way. You should actually celebrate who you are, your background, take pride of it, and blend it into your academic life.”
Frieze and Morales said that the event was a trial run for future events, intended to gauge turnout and interest. Morales said that this panel will emulate future events at a bigger level.
Frieze closed the celebration by emphasizing the importance of promoting diversity in STEM fields. “These are fields that, you know, have very few minorities. And that’s why we’re paying attention,” she said.

Professors given Army grant for new prosthetics research
Krzysztof Matyjaszewski,  a Carnegie Mellon natural sciences professor, and Christopher Bettinger, a materials science and engineering and biomedical engineering professor, have received a $1.6 million grant from the U.S. Army to research prosthetics. The researchers are working with robotic limbs that respond to signals from patients’ brains. They hope to develop materials that respond better and last longer.
“The tissue constructs are designed to make stable, long-term connections between nerves in the peripheral nervous system by mimicking the native tissue areas,” Bettinger said in a university press release.
“New techniques in polymer chemistry have allowed us to make smarter, more durable materials. We have been able to create materials with great potential in a variety of applications. It’s exciting to see if we can make something that will help those who wear prostheses,” said Matyjaszewski in the press release.
Bettinger and Matyjaszewski hope that their work will help American soldiers returning from war with amputated limbs.
Bettinger added in the press release, “It is imperative that we develop pioneering tools and devices to better help our wounded warriors recover from such traumatic injuries.”
ECE offers dual degree with Portuguese business school
Carnegie Mellon’s department of electrical and computer engineering has partnered with the University of Porto’s business school to offer a new dual-degree graduate program in business and engineering.
The program spans two years, allowing participating students to study for one year at the University of Porto in Porto, Portugal and one year at Carnegie Mellon. Students in the program will graduate with a master of science in electrical and computer engineering and a master of business administration.
Ed Schlesinger, Carnegie Mellon’s electrical and computer engineering department head, said in a university press release, “We have our first students enrolled in the new program, and we expect the initiative to grow as more companies globally seek the problem-solving, managerial, and technical skills acquired through engineering and business studies provided by this double M.S./MBA experience.” 
“This new program builds on the long-standing relationship developed with the successful [Information and Communication Technology Institute], in which Carnegie Mellon has partnered with a number of leading Portuguese universities,” he said.

Student Body President for Finance Jon Mark, along with student government’s Executive Branch, is petitioning to raise the student activities fee by 25 percent, or $24 per semester. 
This is a well-meaning cause in theory — student organizations would greatly benefit from more money. Organizations have been hit hard with cutbacks in their budgets, and the reported $272,000 extra revenue from a fee increase would do wonders for student groups. 
However, the intention is where the good part of this proposed increase stops. The reasoning and statistics Mark cites in the various documents he emailed to students on Thursday are vague at best. 
For example, Mark ties the student activities fee to the the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and argues that the CPI has increased by an average of 2.4 percent per year, while the number of student organizations has increased by about 10 percent. 
Mark claims that this is one of the main reasons for cutbacks and why groups are forced to do more with less. However, the CPI is used to calculate inflation in the economy: The Bureau of Labor Statistics determines the average cost for a bundle of household purchases, and the resulting CPI represents the changes in the prices of these average purchases.
The purpose of Carnegie Mellon’s activities fee is not to pay for these average household goods; it’s to print flyers, organize concerts, and bring petting zoos to campus, among other activities. As a result, the CPI is an inaccurate model for price increases and a bad measure for estimating the increase of prices in materials and goods that student groups actually buy.
Similarly, according to Mark’s own graphs in his presentation, the actual revenue student organizations bring in has remained relatively unchanged since 2010. Why has the Joint Funding Committee (JFC) continually set, as Mark put it, “large fundraising expectations” on student groups when they haven’t been able to meet said expectations? The JFC should have understood and adjusted for the obviously unrealistic fundraising expectations it is putting on student groups.
For example, in the 2012 budget, the overall expected revenue of groups was about $900,000, yet the JFC requested $1.2 million in revenue. That $300,000 difference is huge and suggests that the JFC  does not understand how student organizations operate and what they can realistically accomplish. 
Moreover, why has the JFC allowed the Committee on Student Organizations to acknowledge so many groups — an estimated 300 by the end of this academic year — when JFC members have known for years about limited funds? 
Carnegie Mellon is vastly improved by having such a diversity of organizations and avenues for students to get involved, but there is a current redundancy in the missions and goals of numerous student organizations. We acknowledge that student government has been working toward combining student groups to avoid such overlap, but this should not have even become a problem in the first place.
JFC ultimately needs to change the budgeting process and metrics. Until this happens, organizations will still have budget issues that need to be resolved. 
The increased student activities fee would be immensely helpful for the student organizations on campus, but the proposal of the increase must be based on relevant data and realistic expectations. Additionally, current efforts to reduce costs and eliminate redundancies must be pursued more strongly.

The tech wizards at Apple are at it again. Greeting spectators at the California Theatre in San Jose less than two months after the iPhone 5’s announcement, CEO Tim Cook and other executives unveiled a new family of iPads and Macs.
Among the variety of hardware added to Apple’s top-tier product line, a new breed of iPad — the iPad Mini — stole the spotlight as the event’s biggest news. Although the iPad Mini will probably produce record profits, as expected from any new Apple product, the device was announced too late and with too high a price point to be considered a milestone for the company.
Despite boasting a smaller screen than the iPad, Apple promises that the iPad Mini will offer everything its larger sibling does. Consumers will get all the perks of the iPad Mini’s brother — tons of apps, an e-reader, a web browser, you name it — in a more compact form.
The iPad Mini is a great new offering that not only gives consumers a larger selection of Apple tablets, but also provides developers with a new platform for their software. According to Adam Najberg of The Wall Street Journal, the iPad Mini could spur the development of tablet gaming because of its smaller screen — just the right size for portable gaming.
That being said, the tablet’s 16GB entry-level model sells for $329. Compared to the $199 price tag of Amazon’s Kindle Fire HD and Barnes & Noble’s Nook HD, the iPad Mini is an expensive piece of hardware, maybe too expensive for consumers on a budget.
Why spend an extra $130 when there are products on the market that are just as compelling? Unless Apple’s ecosystem of content is important to the consumer, there might not be a reason to justify spending the extra money.
In addition to wondering why the device’s price is so high, another question must be asked: Why did Apple wait so long to launch the iPad Mini?
The original Kindle Fire was announced over a year ago on Sept. 28, while the Nook Color — running Android — was released in late 2010. Other miniature tablets, such as the original Samsung Galaxy Tab, were also released over a year ago.
If the iPad Mini was released around the time of the first portable tablets, it may have been considered a revolutionary competitor. The device is definitely still an enticing option in the tablet market, but it seems more like an afterthought than what could have been a show-stealing product.
Even more disconcerting is Apple’s choice to launch the iPad Mini in October, along with the fourth generation iPad. Why didn’t Apple launch the iPad Mini with the third generation iPad earlier this year or wait until the spring, when iPads have traditionally been launched, to reveal the newest tablets?
The iPad Mini will surely be a hit for the holiday season. Loved ones of all ages will rip open their presents to find the shiny new Apple-branded tablet.
In fact, this holiday season may be one of Apple’s best seasons yet. Still, to many consumers, their third generation iPad or iPad 2 still feels brand new. 
For customers who look forward to buying the latest Apple technology, the thought of buying the iPad Mini after purchasing an iPad a few months earlier may seem unreasonable. Even die-hard fans could find Apple’s latest product launch to be more of a nuisance than a reason to pull out their credit cards.

Fellow Tartans,
Anyone who is at all familiar with our community knows that Carnegie Mellon University is a very special place. We build robots, write sonnets, sing operas, crunch numbers — and that’s just the start of it. Our interests are eclectic, and as a community we could not be more proud of this.
Carnegie Mellon students are extraordinarily passionate. Whether said passion be directed toward our sorority or fraternity, our debate team, our service group, or our residence hall, in one way or another every Carnegie Mellon student has that intense Tartan pride inside of them.
Given that our university is so diverse and our interests so varied, we’ve never been the type of student body that comes together in its entirety for the weekly Saturday football game — but there is no reason that we can’t be.
This coming Saturday marks the final home game of the Carnegie Mellon football season and we wanted to make it special. Our football players have had a tremendous season. Not only is the football team 5–3, but Will and myself have enjoyed an incredible sense of community and school spirit at all of this season’s games. For the final home game of the season, we wanted to combine the student body’s unique expression of spirit with the game day atmosphere in a competition that we are hoping will become an annual event.
It is for these reasons that we have put together the Carnegie Mellon Organization GameDay Competition. At the Saturday football game, which starts at noon at Gesling Stadium, all student organizations, residence halls, Greek houses, and sports teams will be encouraged to compete for the Carnegie Mellon Organization GameDay Cup.
The winner will be determined by three different competitive categories: attendance, creativity, and spirit. Groups will earn points for every member that shows up in their organization or Carnegie Mellon gear and checks in with our representatives at the entrance to the stands.
Attendance scores will also be categorized to reflect the size of the organization and ensure that smaller organizations are given as much of a chance at winning as larger residence halls or Greek houses. Groups can earn points for creativity by designing banners, signs, or shirts that support our football team. We will also be roaming the stands and giving points to those groups who are exemplifying school spirit through cheering and other means of support.
The winners will receive the Carnegie Mellon Organization GameDay Cup, prizes, and free catering for one of their events, provided by the Student Body President and Student Body Vice President.
You can learn more about the Carnegie Mellon Organization GameDay Competition by visiting our Facebook page, facebook.com/cmusbp. We are so excited about the potential of this event, and hope to see you all there.
Meela Dudley
Student Body Vice President

I am an undecided voter, and lately I’ve been taking a lot of heat. People are frustrated that after three presidential debates and months of manipulative advertising, I have yet to make up my mind. The future of our country lies in the choice I make, and I am taking my sweet time. What’s wrong with me? A lot, but I’m not the only one to blame for my indecision.
Frankly, I wouldn’t be in this position if we had better candidates. I couldn’t agree more when people say that this is the election for the “least worst” candidate. If only former governor of Alaska Sarah Palin were running. Instead, we have two candidates who are both flawed in less shallow ways.
I like President Barack Obama as a person. Had I been of age in 2008, I would have voted for him. His message of hope had me hooked. However, four years later, the disappearance of this positivism in favor of acerbic attacks against the opposition is what frustrates me most. Where is that message of hope now? Maybe we do need change, and maybe it starts with changing the person in office.
But should I vote for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney just because he is the only alternative? It’s complicated. Romney is very unlikable. He flips and flops too often. Although he’s unlikable, that doesn’t mean he can’t fix the economy.
Romney’s main selling point is that the incumbent hasn’t done enough for the economy and that he can do a better job. However, the Republican candidate needs a more plausible and convincing plan. I would like to have faith, but the math for his economic recovery simply doesn’t add up — not without the loopholes he is hesitant to name, and not with his intended tax cuts. On the other hand, I don’t know how I feel about Obama’s economic plan because I don’t think it exists. Maybe he thinks no plan will look good next to Romney’s. But he has to show us something, because his record is not that strong.
But there is one more person who also makes my decision so agonizing: the decided voter. Secretly, I’m jealous of that ability to make a big decision and stick with it, yet I marvel at how many can wholeheartedly back either of these candidates. The decided voters’ biases and unconditional support make me want to defend and support the candidate they oppose. At the same time, their arguments do a convincing job of making me lean their way.
But the vehemently partisan voter is also the root of what’s wrong with our political system. After all, in a democracy we select our leaders, and our thirst for harmless fixes has left us with candidates too well versed in manipulation and empty promises. We need to make better choices. To do this, we cannot be voters who respond to the negativity that is our candidates’ favorite form of persuasion. We have to cheer louder when they show us their vision but recognize when we’re being lied to. Most importantly, we have to recognize that our leaders reflect our own strengths and weaknesses, and that to have leaders of great character requires reconsidering our own values.
Maybe I’m being too cynical, and maybe I’m harping too much on our politicians’ negative attributes and our sorry standards. But deep down, I think I could be a romantic. I want to believe in government and its leaders. I want to believe that we will do a better job of choosing these leaders.
In the meantime, this presidential race is just two proud politicians running for office. If you have decided who to vote for, great. I just ask that you give me some space while I make my own decision.

In The Tartan’s last issue, Anna Walsh wrote a wonderful article on Ms. CMU and its “Who Needs Feminism?” campaign. Her conclusion was that Carnegie Mellon still needs feminism because of the sexism that still exists on campus. I agree with her 110 percent. Sexism is pervasive, not just on this campus but pretty much everywhere you look.
But feminism fulfills another, equally critical function. Feminism is important because it reminds us that we learn things we are never explicitly told.
No one in my life ever said, “Chloe, when you react to something emotionally, people will probably think it’s because you’re a girl,” or, “Once you hit the whole puberty thing, people are going to start seeing you as a sexual object. Seriously, your boobs have the potential to outweigh your opinion.”
No one ever said, “It’s okay when boys have frequent, casual sex — beyond okay, it’s actually a good thing! It means he’s virile. But if you do, someone’s probably going to call you a slut.”
No one had to tell me these things because I absorbed that knowledge on my own. That’s the kind of information that filters through when people call a man who has multiple sexual partners a player, but a woman who has the same number of partners a whore, or when people look at a woman in a prominent position and say, “She’s there because she’s a woman.”
This subtle absorption of stereotypes and prejudice is the true enemy of modern feminism. The problem isn’t that boys are told that women exist as sexual objects; it’s that almost every story we hear concludes with an ending like, “And the guy got the girl in the end.” We’ve heard that phrase so many times that there is a silent “of course” tacked onto the end.
This concept implies that hard work and being somehow worthy enough will drop an attractive woman into a guy’s lap like a prize. Human relationships are not like gumball machines. You don’t insert a quarter and get a person.
Just to be clear: No one is attacking individuals over these issues. Most guys I know clam up immediately in the face of a discussion about sexism, because they feel these discussions are personal attacks. They aren’t supposed to be. Sexism is ingrained into us from birth as a social and institutional problem; everyone participates in it and perpetuates it.
When I hear about a guy who has “gone through” three girls in a single week, a little voice in my head murmurs, “He’s a guy. They’re like that.” This is not an admiring observation on my part, but it isn’t a fair one either. And when I hear about a girl doing something similar? The voice whispers, “Slut.” I try to silence that voice at every opportunity, because that girl’s life and body are not mine and therefore not my business, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with embracing one’s sexuality.
The effects of being raised in an inherently sexist system do not disappear overnight. Sometimes they do not disappear at all. I don’t care about how much sex people have. But I’ve grown up in a world that permits and encourages nosing into other people’s lives.
Feminism gives me the ability to see these prejudices in myself and to understand where they come from. In her article, Walsh wrote, “Feminism gives us the space, the vocabulary, and the strength to address [these social issues] head-on.” Feminism also gives us the means to understand how the world molds us, when we don’t even realize that we are being shaped at all.

Student government has an image problem, but this year’s Student Senate Week faced the issues head on.
The editorial board of The Tartan has not been shy in the past about noting the lack of transparency between the student body and Student Senate. Although Senate representatives are very aware of the concerns and priorities of the student body (as students themselves), there is often a lack of visibility with Student Senate’s activities.
Last year, we were very excited to hear the announcement of Carnegie Mellon’s first ever Student Senate Week, a five-day-long series of events aimed at improving transparency. But we were disappointed to find that 2011’s Senate Week focused more on Senators’ awareness of the student body than vice versa. 
However, it seems that this year, Student Senate is aiming to form a stronger relationship with the student body and create a means to disperse information to the campus community. We were very impressed with how this year’s Student Senate went above and beyond and focused Senate Week toward improving the student body’s awareness of Student Senate. 
The presence of representatives tabling outside of the University Center was a notable change from previous years, where student government lacked an ongoing and immediate connection with students on campus.
In particular, The Tartan would like to commend the college representatives who, in conjunction with Senate Week, sent out emails last Monday to just their respective departments’ students. The emails contained the names of the representatives, in order to encourage student body input on Senate initiatives. 
Not only is this a tactful acknowledgement and a step in the right direction toward improving their visibility, but this type of outreach to departments from Student Senators — as individuals with names rather than as an amorphous student organization — is incredibly useful for the student body. 
We strongly encourage the rest of Student Senate to perform similar types of student body outreach in the future.

Well, to put it into terms any hardcore fan of the show Community would understand, it looks like NBC “Britta’d” it again.
For those of you not enamored with the students at Greendale Community College, this means the network screwed up. It is bad enough that, going into this fourth season, NBC fired creator and executive producer Dan Harmon, but now it seems NBC feels that the show is not important enough to merit a proper premiere. If this is how the airing of season four is going to play out, I’d have much rather seen the show cancelled at the end of season three, which I felt wrapped up everything quite nicely anyway.
Yet the question remains: Why bring the show back from extinction just to continue messing with it?
Unsurprisingly, reports seem to indicate that some of NBC’s new comedies aren’t doing so well — they’re doing so poorly, in fact, that even the meager ratings Community usually brings in would be a step up, so the network might move Community back to Thursdays as a lead-in, as speculated by entertainment blog Vulture. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the network just did this with Whitney by cancelling Animal Practice, yet Community remains up in the air.
Alternatively, it could be that NBC wants to double down on the success of the few sitcoms it has that are doing okay, such as Go On, and thus not waste its efforts on promoting Community.
In either case, my resentment comes from the fact that NBC knows that any time slot they put Community in will gather the same core viewers, like myself, who have watched it from the beginning. Community actually gets a significant portion of its views from online and DVR as well, something that network executives have yet to grasp.
I am still baffled by the fact that network television executives mess around with their most critically acclaimed shows that have dedicated audiences. They focus on their simple, trite, safe shows that garner the big ratings because those equal big bucks. Money is their bottom line — but when you have a niche to fill, why not try to please the fans who in theory have tastes must less capricious than the average viewers?
Maybe that’s the problem, though: High-brow shows outside of basic cable and subscription-based networks just don’t have any appeal to the average American. I think that instead of trying to become more in tune with what the public wants, good shows like Community should stick to their guns. If they fail, at least they’ll have failed without selling out. 
And hey, there’s always the Arrested Development route of coming back with new episodes on Netflix seven years later.

Often ignored in the tumult of a presidential election are the numerous elections that will determine the composition of our legislative body. These elections are as important as the presidential race — if not more important — and should not be taken lightly. According to the RealClearPolitics.com polling average, 76.8 percent of Americans disapprove and only 15.4 percent of Americans approve of the job Congress is doing.
This election is a chance to change that. The past two years have been colored by intense congressional gridlock. The debt ceiling debacle in August kicked the can down the road to the deficit reduction supercommittee, which failed to achieve a compromise that would balance the budget, since Democrats refuse to cede spending cuts without increasing taxes and Republicans refuse to increase taxes. This, among other things, has imposed upon us a dangerous set of circumstances called the fiscal cliff.
On Jan. 1, the U.S. is scheduled for an approximated 2 percent GDP reduction, according to economist Michael Hanson in a recent USA Today article. This absolutely catastrophic scenario comes as a result of several measures: the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, reversion of the Alternative Minimum Tax to previous levels, expiration of the reduction in payroll taxes, and new taxes from Obamacare, to name a few.
This scenario has already led to rising uncertainty in the business community and curtailing investment and growth, according to a survey of economists in the same article. Additionally, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, business investment has flatlined completely and companies are just sitting on their money to prepare for the tough times ahead.
The failure of Congress to do something about this is absolutely pathetic. This scenario threatens to catapult the U.S. back into another recession that economists have already started warning us about. Conventional wisdom would have us believe that the Nov. 6 elections will break the gridlock, but the people we elect won’t come into office until late January. It’s up to these guys. What we do in this election, however, will play a big role in what happens.
Should Republicans gain control of the Senate, they’ll have a lot of leverage in the negotiations that are sure to take place before another 11th-hour deal to try and avert this crisis. Republican control of the Senate means the repeal of the undemocratic behemoth that is Obamacare, and it means a balanced approach to deficit reduction that doesn’t discourage business development.
The President has almost nothing to do with this critical problem solving-process, and the vice president only matters as the tie-breaking vote in the Senate. Our Congress alone will determine how and if we can avert this crisis. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Senator Bob Casey Jr. is up for reelection against Republican challenger Tom Smith. A recent Rasmussen Reports poll has shown Casey up on Smith by only one point. This race, right here in our backyard, will play a critical role in determining our future, probably more so than the presidential one.
Take the time to research both of these candidates and vote based upon what direction you want the country to follow, but by no means should we let this crucial race be overlooked.

Two words: dry campus.
Your hard work will pay off this semester and you shall be rewarded... with straight Bs.
Facebook called with a full-time job offer — too bad you put the wrong phone number on your résumé.
You poured your heart and soul into your last essay. When your professor gives you your essay back, instead of giving you a grade, the only thing he wrote on your paper is: TL;DR.
The double life you have been living on Tumblr has been discovered. Don't worry; you're still a star in many people's personal collections.
You are the professor's pet. Hooray! However, instead of being praised and showered with love or good fortune, you have been singled out to do even more work.
You were working in the lab late one night, when your eyes beheld an eerie sight. Your lab notebook, which you had tended to with care, had vanished. It was gone, disappeared into thin air.
You arrive at The Exchange just in time to beat the lunchtime rush, only to find that it has been replaced by another branch of CulinArt.
Your adviser walks up behind you as you're bad-mouthing him or her. You go on and on, until he or she finally interjects.
You know that one kid in your major who is always being a pain in the butt? That person becomes your boss.
No one around you has a sense of humor, and that makes your life sad and boring.
The kid you argue with in your project group has a crush on you, and you two end up dating.
