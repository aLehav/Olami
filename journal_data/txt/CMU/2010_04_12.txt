Carnegie Mellon's Ultimate Frisbee team, "Mr. Yuk," competed with the best in the Pittsburgh area at the 16-team West Penn Sectionals, held in State College, Pa. 
The tournament kicked off on a sunny Saturday morning, with the third-seeded Mr. Yuk easily defeating the Shippensburg B team 13–2 in the opening round. Carnegie Mellon followed the win with a clean sweep of the Messiah B team in the next round, 13–0. Indiana University of Pennsylvania was the next team to fall victim to Mr. Yuk's throwing, managing to score only six goals against Mr. Yuk's 13. Mr. Yuk's run was ended later that afternoon by rival Pennsylvania State with a final score of 14–8.
The top four teams at sectionals earned the chance to travel to New Jersey for the regional tournament during the first week of May. Despite the loss, the Carnegie Mellon team was still in the running for a bid to regionals, a goal the Ultimate Frisbee team has not achieved since 2006. To make the tournament, the team needed to bypass rival Shippensburg. Despite a close match, Mr. Yuk fell 13–9. Later in the day, Mr. Yuk faced Penn State B and Indiana University of Pennsylvania in the consolation rounds and pulled off two more victories, 13–4 and 12–7, respectively. With only one match left to determine the final team that would qualify for the regional tournament, Mr. Yuk once again faced Shippensburg, only to be stopped 15–8 to earn fifth place. 
Mr. Yuk has been able to land its name high in the national rankings, most recently coming in at 52nd in the country in a pool of more than 300 eligible teams in the College Ultimate Championship Series.
The sectional tournament concludes the Ultimate Frisbee season. Look for Mr. Yuk next year when they start up their 2010–11 season.

Greetings, Buggy lovers. Carnival is around the corner, just in time for my carefully calculated analysis and predictions.
This year has been an interesting one at best. After the snowstorm that shut down Carnegie Mellon, leaving only two and a half weekends of practice before Truck Weekend, this spring has been more accident-prone than any in recent history. With a freshly paved Hill 1 and 2, look for the fastest freeroll times we’ve seen in years. Given the number of accidents and incidents, along with four new and seemingly unproven buggies rolling around the course, we’re set for what may turn out to be one of the most surprising years yet.
Starting with the women: Look for Fringe A’s usual lack of speed in the feminine department to squeeze them into a sixth-place finish. On the other side of that coin, look for SPIRIT A’s mechanical incompetence to slow down their speedy women for a fifth-place finish. 
You’ll see SDC B use their buggy to put them in a solid fourth place. PiKA will slide into third place just behind an up-and-coming SigEp A, whose buggy program is really making a push as of late. Of course, SDC A’s speed and technological advantage will place them way ahead of the pack, but don’t expect them to set a new record like they did last year.
For the men, it looks to be a race for second, but let’s start at the back of the pack. Expect to see SDC push three buggies to day two, with SDC C coming in at 10th, somewhere around the 2:15 mark. Assuming PiKA B doesn’t crash in the Chute, expect inexperienced pushers and driver to land them in ninth on day two, if only because of the buggy.
As a dark horse this year, CIA A will come in at eighth with a rigid push bar that should allow them to give their pushers a chance and freeroll times this spring that are keeping them competitive. We’ll see Fringe B show up with a sub-2:15 time to pull off seventh, being slightly edged out by SigNu A, who has shown faster freelroll times than usual but still leaves a lot to be desired in the pusher department. SigEp A will follow up their surprising advancement in speed from last year with a fifth-place finish, behind SDC B at fourth, whose push team would outclass the majority of A teams in the field.
Now for the top three. PiKA A’s unusual lack of new buggy smells of a deficiency in the mechanic department, and this, along with their absence of seasoned pushers, will put them at third place. Fringe has shown nothing but a solid year, rolling well and constantly making me double check my stop watch. Look for Fringe A to improve on their time from last year, but only slightly, to get second place. I don’t expect a sub-2:07 from them. SDC has not made mistakes this year, and in first place this year will be their A team. Expect a sub-2:03 time, as they have shown significant improvement within the past two years, and according to the times I’ve been getting, this trend will continue.
Expect a weekend of speed and hazards, and be sure to check out the three-buggy start on Hill 1. Thanks to the freshly-paved Hills 1 and 2, it’s bound to make things interesting going into the free roll.
Well, that’s all I have for this year; good luck to all the teams. I can’t wait to see this year’s races, but you’ll never notice me.
Women’s: 
1) SDC A 
2) SigEp A 
3) PiKA A 
4) SDC B 
5) SPIRIT A 
6) Fringe A
Men’s: 
1) SDC A (4 seconds) 
2) Fringe A 
3) PiKA A 
4) SDC B 
5) SigEp A 
6) SigNu A 
7) Fringe B 
8) CIA A 
9) PiKA B 
10) SDC C
AEPi — One bolt doesn’t work for two wheels.
Beta — Ready for an explosive year?
CIA — Name your new buggy Viagra; “it stays up.”
DTD — Driving To Disappoint.
Fringe — Wait for SDC to miss the push bar, then take the win.
KKG/ZBT — Buggies aren’t built in the kitchen; who wears the pants in this relationship?
PhiKap — Beat your time from ’29.
PiKA — The new SPIRIT; your alumni must be so disappointed in you…
Pioneers — Pioneering failure since 1988.
SAE — Only good for wasting this line.
SigEp — Without PiKA’s help, what will you do?
SigNu — Rolling out of the haze too slowly.
SPIRIT — Did you pass your crash test yet?

Last weekend, the Carnegie Mellon track and field team was met with back-to-back action. On Friday, April 9, the distance runners competed in Bucknell University’s Bison Outdoor Classic in Lewisburg, Pa. The following day, the Tartans hosted a quad meet of their own, competing with Penn State University Behrend, Washington & Jefferson College, and Westminster College. The women won the quad meet, while the men ended up taking second place.
“I’m pleased with the times I’ve run this season because the whole program is still new to me,” first-year Noel Titus stated. “I’m still getting accustomed to the more demanding schedule collegiate athletics require and the conditioning techniques of our coaches. I think this meet was a success for the Tartans because everyone stepped up and used the competition to motivate themselves.”
He added, “Across the board, our guys and girls were giving each event their all.”
At Bucknell, Carnegie Mellon runners impressed the competition with several top finishes. In the women’s 1500-meter run, junior Laura McKee took fourth place in 4:53.44, while junior Nate Bussiere snagged second in the men’s 1500-meter run, two seconds behind the leader with a time of 3:56.79. Senior Dario Donatelli took seventh in the 5000-meter run and finished in 15:04.89.
The next day at the quad meet, the women came out on top of a close match, scoring one point over Westminster to win the meet. First-year Lisa Rising made her mark by finishing third in the 1500-meter run in 5:48.86, while teammate junior Courtney Baker won the 800-meter run with a time of 2:20.43. In the 400-meter run, senior Diane Mattingly pulled through for the ladies with a third-place finish in a time of 1:10.49. In the 100-meter dash, sophomore Ivana Moses pulled out a third-place finish with a time of 13.48. In the 100-meter hurdles, sophomore Luci Laffitte stole third in 16.72, while in the 400-meter hurdles, senior Crystal LeePow also came in third in 1:10.29. 
LeePow was followed closely by teammate first-year Leila Bouabdellaoui, who took fourth in the event in 1:10.98. Sophomore Christine Warner stole the spotlight in the 5000-meter run, where she placed third in 19:44.81.
Moses continued to dominate the field, where she won both the long and triple jump with distances of 5.19 meters and 10.58 meters, respectively. Sophomore Lisa Marion Garcia also impressed when she won the pole vault, clearing 2.80 meters. First-year Carissa Iannone left an impact on the scoreboard when she placed third in the hammer throw with a distance of 24.58 meters.
As for the men, senior Chris Rizzo won the 3000-meter steeplechase in 10:04.68, while Titus took first in the 100-meter dash in 11.47 and second in the 200-meter dash in 23.24. In the 1500-meter run, first-year Evan Gates managed third in a time of 4:10.03, while first-year Ben Finch turned heads when he earned his first win in the 5000-meter run in 16:29.78. Finally, the Tartans placed first through fourth in their trademark 800-meter run, led by sophomore Rob Morhard, junior Justin Kurp, junior Dan Addis, and junior John Briguglio with times of 1:57.92, 1:58.32, 1:59.48, and 1:59.74, respectively.
On the field, senior James Hulley once again came through by winning the shot put and setting a new school record, with a NCAA provisionally qualifying distance of 16.61 meters. Hulley also won the discus throw, clearing a distance of 45.41 meters. Graduate student Chris Fornataro took the spotlight in the hammer throw, winning the event in 49.97 meters, while Hulley placed second in the event in 44.05 meters. In the long jump, sophomore Ryan Kissel earned third with a 6.59-meter clearance, while junior Pat O’Brien took second in the high jump with a height of 1.85 meters. In the pole vault, senior Chris Bridgman took second in 4.55 meters, while junior Dustin Musselman placed second in the javelin throw, clearing 53.03 meters.
Hulley was satisfied with his performance. “I’ve been fighting a hip flexor injury for a few weeks, so I was a little worried about discus,” he said. “While I’m still lifting heavily and throwing minimally, this season I’ve been improving steadily and threw a lifetime best this past weekend. With our outdoor schedule, the time between UAAs and NCAAs is a great opportunity to focus on one event instead of all three.”
Look for the Tartans as they compete next against Westminster College on Saturday, April 17.

The first time I realized that ESPN was starting to get annoying was when I heard the following sentence actually read aloud on SportsCenter after Opening Day 2002:
“His two home runs put him on pace for 324, which would absolutely smash Barry Bonds’ single-season record.”
The Pirates’ Garrett Jones, the Blue Jays’ Vernon Wells, and the Cardinals’ Albert Pujols were among those with two home runs on Opening Day 2010. Jones and Wells both homered in their second game of the season as well, and Wells even homered a third consecutive day to give him quite an opening series.
Time, folks, to hold onto your hats, take a deep breath, and put away your record books. I won’t lie, I’d take a homer per day any day of the week and twice on Saturday (though they never schedule doubleheaders anymore).  Even a homer every other day would be nice. But we know that won’t happen.
Wells’ projected home run pace dropped from 324 to 243 to 216 through those monstrous first three games, and after Saturday’s game was at a “mere” 129. His performance last week will be enough to earn him a starting spot in this year’s All-Star Game, especially with the voting seemingly starting earlier and earlier; mark my words, you will see the word “VOTE” splattered all over MLB.com come next week, perhaps earlier. Remember, folks: This time it counts.
Any baseball fan old enough to remember 2006 will recognize the name Chris Shelton, most recently of cut-from-the-Astros-in-spring-training fame. Shelton began the 2006 season as Detroit’s starting first baseman and took the American League Central by storm, becoming the first AL player ever to hit nine homers in his first 13 games. He received a plethora of early All-Star votes as everyone in baseball wondered who this guy was and where he came from. 
Turns out he came from right where he ended back up that very July: the minors. He ended up hitting only 16 homers, with 102 hits and 107 strikeouts.
Wells, Jones, and Pujols should all have impressive numbers come the end of the season. After down years in 2008 and 2009, Wells seems to have regained his power stroke at least for now and will probably end up around 28 to 34 homers and right around 100 runs batted in. Albert Pujols will always be King Albert and there is no reason that he won’t one day win a Triple Crown. Jones will probably keep up pretty consistent production, but the league still has a bit of time to fully figure him out. I still expect a breakout season overall, even if he finishes it with another team — he is on the Pirates, after all, where no one succeeding is ever safe.
Short hops: Speaking of the Pirates, wins on Monday and Wednesday gave them their first 2–0 start since 2007. They then lost their next two games before winning Saturday to clinch at least a .500 mark in their first week of play. While it isn’t quite the Royals’ 9–0 start to the 2003 season, it’s something. The Mets are already partying like it’s 2009, leaving a combined 28 runners on base in their three losses through Saturday
It was a somewhat even start to the year, as only one team — the San Francisco Giants — had a perfect record after only four games.

Last weekend, the 11th-ranked Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team took home the crown at the Great Lakes Colleges Association Tournament, overcoming the seventh-ranked Kenyon College and two other schools along the way.
“I can’t say enough about how big this win is,” senior Jon Spero said. “We are definitely one of the hottest teams in the country right now.”
Entering the tournament as the second seed, the Tartans had high expectations going for them. After receiving a bye in the first round, the Tartans faced Calvin College in the quarterfinals. The Tartans easily put down the Knights 5–0 without dropping a set. 
After sweeping doubles, first-year Duke Miller closed out his match at the fourth singles position, 6–2, 6–1, followed by fellow first-year Civan Orhan, who won 6–0, 6–4.
In the semifinals, the Tartans encountered slight resistance against number-15 Kalamazoo College. Doubles play went fairly quickly; the Tartans swept doubles again, this time only dropping a combined seven games to give themselves a 3–0 lead. Without missing a step, the Tartans charged full steam ahead in singles, with junior Alex Nemerov beating his opponent at first singles, 6–0, 6–2. 
Adding two more wins to complete the six points were Miller, who overcame his opponent 6–2, 6–0, and Spero, 6–4, 6–3.
“Kalamazoo is a top-15 team who plays very good doubles, so I think that shows the level we played at only surrendering seven games,” Spero added. “It was nice to have that cushion because we had some guys struggling physically in singles.”
For the final round of the tournament, the Tartans went head-to-head against seventh-ranked Kenyon. Stillfresh from their match earlier in the day, the Tartans came out swinging only to fall behind the Lords 2–1 after doubles, with the lone win coming from the second doubles team of junior Bobby MacTaggart and Nemerov, 8–4.
Already at a disadvantage, the Tartans soon trailed the Lords in singles play. Despite some intense fighting, five of the six singles matches were down a set, giving a foreboding tone to the outcome of the match. Yet the Tartans hung in and rallied to shift the momentum. MacTaggart added the first singles win to tie the score at 2–2, followed by tremendous comebacks from Miller (1–6, 6–3, 6–2) and Spero (1–6, 6–3, 6–0) at fourth and fifth singles, respectively. Senior James Muliawan clinched the win just 15 minutes later, defeating Kenyon’s Jeremy Polster 5–7, 6–4, 6–3.
Spero was ecstatic. “We knew the match with Kenyon would be a war. It’s always close against them. We had chances to win three doubles but didn’t convert, so we had to win four singles. They have two of the best players in the country, and Coach told us we were going to win the match if we got one of those top two spots.” He added, “We lost five first sets but battled back at three through five. We were just tougher at the end. We are really looking forward to UAAs at home.”
On a hot streak, the Tartans are looking forward to both an increase in national ranking and a dual match at home against Grove City College next Tuesday at 4 p.m.

The Carnegie Mellon rowing team showed considerable strength on April 3 at the Marietta Invitational in Marietta, Ohio. The tournament was held on Muskingum River, which runs besides Marietta College. Although they have never raced on these waters before, the Tartans blasted past competitors, putting two boats in first place.
The men’s novice A-boat took first in a 2000-meter race. The boat consisted of four rowers: senior Brian Aebersold and first-years Brendan White, Juan Medina, and Oscar Chahin, rounded out by first-year coxswain Josh Harvey. “It was a good race. We worked hard and outlasted the other crews,” Harvey said after the race.
The women’s  varsity A-boat also took first in a 2000-meter race. This boat consisted of rowers junior Emily Lesinski, sophomore Liz Mahaffa, first-year Paige Wilson, and junior Claire Herdeman. Sophomore Gabbi Coloyan coxed for the boat.
Tartan rowing also had an admirable finish in the men’s varsity 2000-meter race, placing second after reaching the finish line in 6:37. The four-man boat consisted of juniors Jonah Coste, Justin Perry, Sean Lubner, and Andrew Kojzar, with junior Nadja Yacker coxing for the Tartans.
Carnegie Mellon also sent a women’s pair to Philadelphia to compete in the 2010 Murphy Cup Regatta. In the heat of battle, the two-person boat rowed strong and raced into first place for their division, crossing the line with a time of 8:13. 
The boat consisted of seniors Megan Larcom and Alyssa Fogel.
The team’s recent successes can be attributed to the members’ strong work ethic. The crew team trains twice a day and is out on the Allegheny River in the evening. To prepare for the races, members practice almost every weekend; they practice steady-state rowing, sprints, intervals, and race training.
The crew team looks to uphold its good performance for next week, when the team will be heading to Camden, N.J. to compete in the Knecht Cup.

This past week, the Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team, ranked 10th in the nation in Division III, took on two tough opponents on their home courts. On Easter Sunday, the Tartans took on number-13 rival Johns Hopkins University in what proved to be a strong win for the Tartans. Just a few days later, the Tartans clashed with the women of the University of Pittsburgh in a friendly scrimmage to prepare for the upcoming UAA Championships.
After watching the men’s team defeat Hopkins in an upset, the women were set to take the court on a beautiful day. Firing on all cylinders, the Tartans wasted no time establishing themselves in this match. 
The doubles team of junior Ashley Herrick and sophomore Laura Chen overpowered their opponents at first doubles by a score of 8–2. Not long after, the third doubles team of junior Jennifer Chui and sophomore Cze-Ja Tam was victorious by a score of 8–6. Sophomore Courtney Chin and first-year Alexandra Tapak, at second doubles, completed the sweep by taking their match by a score of 8–6.
Staked to a 3–0 lead from doubles, the Tartans looked to be in good shape going into singles play. However, the Blue Jays rallied and closed the gap, as the Tartans suffered a quick loss at sixth singles and a devastating three-set loss at second singles. The Tartans responded quickly, notching a key win at fifth singles by Tam to make the match 4–2. Playing at first singles, Chen delivered the deciding match by coming out on top by a score of 6–2, 6–2. With the day already won, the Tartans lost at third and fourth singles, both in deciding-match tiebreakers.
Coming off a victory, the Tartans were confident going into their scrimmage with the University of Pittsburgh. With a multitude of spectators looking on, the Tartans fought hard in doubles, but dropped two out of the three to go down 2–1. The doubles team of Tapak and Chin recorded the lone win with a score of 8–5.
Needing four out of the six singles to win, things were looking bleak for the Tartans. Carnegie Mellon quickly dropped two singles matches, putting them in an almost insurmountable 4–1 hole. Wins at second and fifth singles by Chin and Tam, respectively, gave the Tartans some hope with two matches to go. However, a tough loss at first singles sealed the deal and led to the Panthers topping the Tartans by a score of 6–3.
Although it was only a scrimmage, the players fought hard and viewed this match as a learning experience. “I’m glad we played such a strong Division I team,” Chen said. “It will really help prepare us for our huge UAA tournament coming up, in which we’ll play some of the best teams in the country.”
The Tartans will next compete at the UAA Championships, held at Case Western Reserve University April 16–18, in the hope of capturing a regional title.

After leading the past several tournaments for the Tartans’ golf team, senior Chris Lee hopes to place in the top 10 during the remaining two tournaments of the season. Moreover, Lee notes a team goal of repeating the conference title at the University Athletic Association (UAA) tournament at the end of this month. Last season, Lee was an UAA Individual Champion and was given First Team All-UAA honors, while also taking part in the team’s first trip to the National Collegiate Athletic Association Championships.
Luckily for Lee, the strong academics at Carnegie Mellon were paired with an up-and-coming golf team when he was making his decision on where to go to college, leaving this school a positive choice for him overall. Despite a lack of extra time between golf and schoolwork, Lee has been a part of the AB Concerts Committee and the Undergraduate Financial Association, and he is currently involved with Mortar Board Honor Society, which concentrates on serving the community at large. With an interest in different types of food, Lee cites having a multitude of favorite cuisines, ranging from Korean to Italian to Brazilian.
After graduating this upcoming May, Lee will use his business degree, with a focus in finance, from Tepper to join Citigroup’s Capital Markets Origination group in New York City. Although he is a native of Los Angeles, Lee seems to have found a successful niche in the Northeast and hopes to maintain golf as a main part of his active life as he pursues his business career. As for some parting words to his fellow undergraduate teammates, Lee said: “My advice to the underclassmen is to be diligent about everything you do. Succeeding in golf and academics isn’t so much about your talent; rather, it is about how well you prepare and manage your time.”

The Carnegie Mellon golf team kicked off a busy week by shooting 316 in consecutive rounds to take eighth at the two-day, par-71 Mid-Atlantic Regional hosted at the Hershey Country Club in Hershey, Pa.
During the tournament, the Tartans were led by senior Chris Lee, who recorded the top score of 157. Just behind him was junior Brent Driscoll, who shot 158, followed closely by sophomores Terence Einhorn and Michael Cheng, who carded 159 and 160, respectively. Rounding out the five-man team was senior Brett Cannaday, who finished five strokes behind Cheng with 165.
“Unfortunately we didn’t play as well as we can, and our performance on the greens really let us down,” Einhorn stated. “There were some positive signs from all our players, but the tough holes on that course really got the better of us. This Thursday we are playing on our home course, where knowing the course well is a gigantic advantage.”
Cheng has a confident outlook for the future. “I look forward to our upcoming tournament. Since these are played at our home course, I think we should be able to take advantage of these opportunities and win,” he said.
The Tartans hit the links just three days later to host the Carnegie Mellon Invitational at the Longue Vue Country Club. 
With a favorable home-course advantage, the Tartans did in fact outshoot their opponents to take first place, beating out second-place St. Vincent College by three strokes with a final tally of 306.
Lee once again led the Tartans to a first-place finish. This time he was followed by Cheng, who shot just one stroke back at 73. Einhorn carded a 78 to finish ninth overall at the invitational. Cannaday shot an 83 on the day, while Discoll finished scoring for the Tartans with an 89.
Four other Tartan golfers also competed at the tournament. Seniors Nick Burkholder and Adam Klein placed ninth and 12th, carding 78 and 79, respectively. First-year Steven Nguyen knocked off an 83, while sophomore Alexander Cohen finished just four strokes behind with an 87.
The men’s golf team also hosted the annual Edward Jones Shootout, at The Links in Apollo, Pa., and placed third.

To many people, video games are an essential part of life. What attracts people to games varies: for some it’s the competition: For some it’s about problem solving, and for others it’s just recreational. However, according to one Carnegie Mellon professor, life may one day resemble the games that so many enjoy, as more companies and businesses are making products that take advantage of popular elements of video games.
Jesse Schell is a professor of game design and teaches the popular Building Virtual Worlds course in the Entertainment Technology Center. He also owns his own line of video games, Schell Games. He coined the term “Gamepocalypse” in order to describe what he thinks is life’s resemblance to a video game. “We already see games creeping up into our everyday lives in all kinds of funny ways,” Schell noted in an interview with The Escapist magazine.
Schell cited several examples of Gamepocalypse in the same interview, including Starbucks using a point system in order to provide its customers with rewards such as coupons and price reductions. In an interview with CNN, he claimed that people’s lives will be “co-opted by games, sort of like how we saw advertising co-opt huge amounts of lives in the 20th century.”
Schell credits new developments in tracking technology as a catalyst for Gamepocalypse. “Games are always trying to be new,” he said, “and one way to create new games is through new kinds of input.” Schell points at input technologies in games like Dance Dance Revolution and the Wii remote, which tracks the movement of the body and makes it a part of gameplay. Such input technology can also be seen in recent gadgets such as smartphones and GPS systems, which take in a certain location as input.
Schell also noted that camera technologies will be the next big step in input technology. Cameras have necessary functions for capturing facial expressions and determining location, and such technology has already been implemented in the Xbox 360 and Nintendo DSi.
The Internet and Wi-Fi will also contribute to Gamepocalypse growth in the coming years, Schell predicts. “Anything meaningful that you do in your life,” Schell said, “there are ways that you’ll want to hook it up to the Internet.” Indeed, with technologies like Nike+ shoes, which measure the number of steps taken while wearing them and can be connected to computers via USB, connectivity is very much already a large part of life.
Much of this Internet accessibility is a wise market strategy on behalf of companies. Marketers see the power that this game society has, and if they know how buyers are using their goods, they will have a better idea on how to sell them. Interconnectivity between companies is becoming common. For example, becoming a fan of Bing on Facebook earns a user Farmville points. All of these industries benefit from that one decision to earn points.
Gamepocalypse, however, has its downsides. On the one hand, it benefits individuals; according to Schell, “when people observe [changes that the games make that impact them], they change their behaviors for the better.” On the other hand, some sectors, such as the tobacco industry and fast food, might take advantage of their own point incentives and potentially endanger individuals’ health. The choices, Schell admitted, are becoming harder.
Schell currently hosts a blog, “Gamepocalypse Now,” for the discussion of this topic. He invites viewers to send in examples of Gamepocalypse that they observe, and he also has posted a video of a talk he gave on G4TV. His blog is at gamepocalypsenow.blogspot.com.

Keeping data secure is not easy. With one lapse of judgment and one lost laptop, millions of credit card and Social Security numbers can fall into the hands of fraudsters and criminals. Average people also have some amount of personal information on their computers that they would not want to be made available to the highest bidder. However, only a few people are paranoid enough to take effective measures against such possibilities. Carnegie Mellon professor Adrian Perrig and Ph.D. student Ahren Studer may have a solution for everyone.
According to a Carnegie Mellon press release, Perrig and Studer’s project, called MULE (Mobile User Location-specific Encryption), provides a way for the average user to effortlessly ensure that his or her sensitive digital files are safe even when the laptop that contains them is lost or stolen. According to Studer, MULE is a “means to protect sensitive documents on laptops, so that if you lose your laptop, all of your sensitive documents would still be secure.”
Traditionally, the reason security is compromised is not because the technology is not powerful enough, but because people cannot be bothered to jump through the hoops needed for security. People want passwords that are easy to remember, but such passwords are often easily broken by guessing randomly. The team has come up with the innovative idea of having the user’s location act as the “password.”
They noticed that people usually access sensitive data in trusted locations. Most people would prefer to file their tax returns at home rather than at a coffee shop. Employees tend to look at confidential documents at the office rather than on a park bench. Thus, by ensuring that certain pieces of data can only be accessed certain locations, a thief would have to return to the person’s home in order to access the data, an unlikely occurrence.
Perrig and Studer ensure that the sensitive data can only be accessed at the trusted location by encrypting the data, rendering it unreadable, and then ensuring that it can only be decrypted using information that is only available at the trusted location. According to the researcher’s project report, found online at sparrow.ece.cmu.edu/group/pub/studer_wisec10.pdf, all one needs is a webcam installed with Trusted Platform Modules, which are already installed with most webcams. The user would then have to install a trusted location device that would send location data to the laptop. This information is transmitted to the computer through an infrared transmitter similar to the one in a TV remote and is received by a webcam that many laptops already have built in.
Since infrared signals  cannot pass through walls, anyone who cannot see the transmitter cannot decrypt the data. In addition, since the signal is invisible, it can be kept running continuously, reducing the need for the user to interact with it.
This forms part of Studer’s larger research interest, which is about physical security as digital security. His idea is simple: If your data is in a place where thieves cannot get to it physically, they are also unable to get to it though digital means like hacking. He hopes that enough people will be interested in the research to pick it up for production or to work with him to popularize it.

Globally, more than 7000 people are infected with HIV every day, totaling to the staggering figure of approximately 2.7 million people per year. Can a pill a day help turn the tide of this pandemic? Scientists and government officials are seriously looking for an answer to this question. The answer is HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis, known as PrEP for short. Prophylaxis treatment is a form of disease prevention that involves taking medicine before exposure to the disease.
This new up-and-comer for HIV/AIDS prevention is not a completely unfamiliar idea. There are other areas of medicine where prevention through chemical prophylaxis has been effective. Taking malaria medications, for example, before one travels to malaria-affected countries is also a form of PrEP. This way, the medicine against the malaria parasites is already in one’s bloodstream to fight off the virus the instant the body comes in contact with the parasites. Wearing sunscreen before exposure to sun to prevent sunburn is also a form of PrEP. Scientists are investigating whether a similar method will work for HIV.
Although antiretroviral medicine, which suppresses the replication of HIV, has only been used as a treatment after HIV infection so far, scientists are exploring if antiretroviral medicine can also be used for prevention. With efforts for an HIV/AIDS vaccine repeatedly failing, PrEP is now in the spotlight as a safe and effective risk-reducing method. Currently, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are conducting clinical trials of HIV PrEP inside and outside of the country. Evidence seems to support encouraging possibilities for PrEP, yet practical concerns for implementation still remain.
While all clinical trials so far are for only the standard everyday PrEP with everyday doses of antiretroviral medication, some researchers are looking into intermittent PrEP, or iPrEP. Prevention through using antiretroviral medicine before exposure is the same as with iPrEP. Yet iPrEP looks into taking antiretroviral drugs only during certain days of the week or before anticipated HIV exposure.
Scientists have high hopes for PrEP because of the implications of previous studies on HIV/AIDS prevention. First, the CDC cites studies where mothers during labor and newborns after birth were given antiretroviral drugs, which show that the risk of infection for the newborns from their mothers was reduced by about 50 percent. Second, when health care workers took antiretroviral drugs promptly after accidental exposures and continuously for several weeks, there was a significant reduction in the risk of infection. Third, it has been shown in monkeys that PrEP with antiretroviral medicine reduces the risk of their infection with a virus like HIV for monkeys.
In addition to previous clinical trials, a mathematical model study gave weight to the optimistic prospects of PrEP. A study led by David Paltiel in the Yale School of Public Health revealed that if PrEP were introduced, it would dramatically cut the lifetime infection rate for men who have sex with men from 44 percent to 25 percent. This mathematical model was based on an already existing dataset of a sample of men who have sex with men from a vaccine trial study, with the mean age of 34. The model was designed to take into account various lifestyles including multiple partners and irregular condom use among the sample.
The results of current trials by the CDC are due in the next few years. The CDC clarified that the public needs to understand that PrEP cannot be the magic shield to replace all other prevention methods. “Because PrEP is unlikely to be 100 percent effective,” the CDC said in its statement, “it will need to be used in combination with other proven HIV prevention approaches.” However, the CDC stated that PrEP would be a valuable additional safety net to those who are at a high risk of HIV infection. Questions regarding wide applications and political hurdles also remain. The high costs of antiretroviral drugs pose the difficult question of who gets the priority when there are limited resources.

In the late 1950s, many women began giving birth to babies with severe limb defects. These babies had limbs that resembled the flippers of whales or seals — the limbs were extremely short with the fingers often protruding from the shoulder blades. Scientists coined this condition “phocomelia,” literally meaning “seal limb,” but were baffled as to what could be the cause of these debilitating defects. A New York Times article illustrates that the problem was most severe in Europe, and it was not until nearly 10,000 children had been born with this defect that the cause was determined. The problem stemmed from popular pills that pregnant women took to counter morning sickness, pills which contained a substance known as thalidomide.
Soon after the harmful effects of thalidomide on developing embryos were determined, the morning sickness pill was banned. However, thalidomide is not completely out of the picture; in fact, the drug is extremely effective in curing certain skin diseases and cancers. According to an article on www.MayoClinic.com, in 1998 the FDA approved the use of thalidomide for treating skin lesions formed due to leprosy. In 2006, the FDA also approved the use of thalidomide for treating multiple myeloma — cancer affecting the blood and bone marrow. Thalidomide is especially useful as an anti-cancer therapy as it prevents the recruitment of blood vessels to newly formed tumors, thus preventing the cancerous cells from growing and spreading. The drug has proven to be useful in treating mouth ulcers of HIV patients and also as an anti-inflammatory agent. However, in spite of thalidomide’s usefulness, many still fear that its continued use will once again give rise to babies with severe limb defects.
Unraveling the mystery behind thalidomide means figuring out how it can be so useful in some instances and so debilitating in others. This has been the primary focus of many researchers for some time. Researchers have been trying to create a drug that can be used as a thalidomide replacement, which will have all the positive effects of the drug but will be safer to use. The New York Times article describes that one of the major difficulties in studying thalidomide is the fact that it breaks down into 18 different chemicals once it enters the body. Out of the 18 possible chemicals that could cause embryonic defects, scientists were able to narrow the possibilities down to one chemical, called CPS49. When CPS49 was tested on chicken embryos, it caused limb defects in the developing chicks. Scientists hypothesize that CPS49 prevents the development of blood vessels — a property extremely valuable for dealing with cancer, but dangerous for the developing embryo. In the developing embryos, structures called limb buds eventually form limbs. Development from the limb buds begins later than other structures of the body. Hence, if thalidomide is taken in later stages of pregnancy, other body parts of the embryo will not be affected since the blood vessels in these parts are already formed. However, since the blood vessels to the limbs are still forming, the drug could cause limb defects.
The role of CPS49 in limb defects was described in a paper published last year, but the exact mechanism by which CPS49 affected development was relatively unknown. And just a month ago, one of the major pieces of the thalidomide puzzle fell into place.
According to an article published this March in Science, thalidomide is capable of binding to a protein known as cereblon, which is found in both adult and embryonic tissues. Scientists found out that preventing the production of cereblon caused limb defects in chickens and zebrafish, similar to those caused due to thalidomide. The scientists also discovered that when these organisms contained a form of cereblon that could not bind to thalidomide, severe limb malformation was not seen even after thalidomide was added to the embryos.
This discovery has brought scientists a step closer to understanding how thalidomide functions in the body. However, until a replacement for thalidomide is found, it has to be prescribed with great care. Patients prescribed to take thalidomide are often advised to take birth control medications and to have frequent pregnancy tests.

Our universe may be inside a wormhole
Scientists have long been baffled by the creation of our universe, but an idea has been proposed that may give insight into many unanswered questions, including the elusive theory unifying the four fundamental forces of nature. Nikodem Poplawski, a theoretical physicist at Indiana University in Bloomington, has suggested that our universe may have been born from a larger universe. His theory makes use of white holes, which can be seen as the reverse of black holes. Matter cannot enter white holes, but it can escape. White holes are connected to black holes by wormholes.
According to Poplawski, an implosion may have occurred in the larger universe, creating a wormhole that connects a white and black hole. Our universe is inside this wormhole, and since matter can only move in one direction, this accounts for the observed expanding universe.
 Every time a black hole is created, he says, another universe may be forming inside a wormhole.

New species live without oxygen
Three species of Loricifera, tiny animals that live in marine sediment, have been discovered in the Mediterranean Sea at the bottom of L’Atelante Basin, whose extreme salinity prevents oxygen from mixing with the water. These are the first organisms discovered that spend their entire lives in an oxygen-free environment.
The new species, which have not yet been named, do not use mitochondria for energy. Mitochondria are organelles, or structures in a cell, that are present in every organism that needs oxygen. Instead, they use a different organelle that produces energy without oxygen. This discovery confirms the possibility of animals living in the most hazardous environments.

Memristors may replace transistors
Hewlett-Packard has announced that memristors, a shortened form for “memory transistors,” may replace traditional transistors in computers as the size of computer chips becomes atomic. Transistors are an important component in most, if not all, electronics, and amplify or switch electrical signals to direct them correctly. Today’s transistors are semiconductor transistors, but memristors can also store information without the need of an electrical current. Scientists say they resemble biological brains more than computing devices.
Memristor technology uses a thin film of titanium dioxide, which changes atomic structure slightly when current is passed through. This small alteration causes the resistivity of the film to change, which can be measured. Memristors will be 10 times smaller than the most advanced transistors today at a size of only three nanometers, and they will be able to work at speeds measured in nanoseconds.

The annual clearing of the Morewood parking lot is the easiest way for students at Carnegie Mellon to tell that spring has truly sprung. This was certainly the case when, last Friday, students began transporting their large unfinished wooden structures across Morewood and Forbes Avenue to the asphalt clearing. This was Move-On, the beginning of Build Week, and the beginning of a series of days dedicated to preparing booths for Spring Carnival. 
Although it’s a loud and difficult process, for students, Move-On symbolizes the coming of Carnival, warm weather, and the end of the semester. For those who are unfamiliar with it, Move-On is the process during which Booth contenders transport their structures from their various Greek houses or the cages to Midway to begin Build Week. However, booths aren’t just thrown together during Build Week — Carnival contenders begin construction of their booths long before Carnival. Whether it be painting, preparing decorations, or actually working on the solid wooden structure that will come to support hundreds of onlookers during Carnival week, participants have to be well prepared — they simply will not be able to put their booth together if they wait until the last minute.
The process itself is absolutely fascinating to watch. Over the course of a couple of days, students work nonstop to erect massive wooden structures whose creative designs are all unified under a common theme. “It’s such a spectacle,” said a first-year electrical and computer engineering major Ryan Salvo. “My friends and I have been watching their progress from the Morewood E Tower lounges; it’s amazing that they get the booths up so fast!”
This year’s theme is “History with a Twist,” and Booth contenders are going all out. Some booths will feature local sports teams, some will track the lives of notable Pittsburghers, and some will embody our favorite Disney movies. Whatever the theme, this year’s booths will be sure to please!
Carnival will feature a ton of events worth attending, so make sure you try to go to as many as possible. Turn to pages B8 and B9 to plan your Carnival experience with The Tartan’s Midway map and major events calendar.

To an unprepared passerby, the marquee of Mr. Small’s Theatre & Funhouse might have suggested that the venue was hosting some sort of twisted feminist convention when, last Monday evening, Millvale played host to two spectacular bands — Girls and the Dum Dum Girls.
Girls, an indie rock group from San Francisco, was thrown into fame when the band’s debut album, Album, was rated as the 10th best album of 2009 by the popular music critique website Pitchfork Media. Often described as the shoegaze jangle-pop rebirth of the Beach Boys, Girls is currently signed with Matador Records and working on content for their sophomore release.
With all the hype that has been surrounding Girls in the 2009–2010 year, one wouldn’t expect the group to be so easily upstaged by it’s opening act. The current members of the Dum Dum Girls, originally formed by front woman Kristin Gundred (stage name Dee Dee) in 2008 as a solo project, came together to record their debut full-length album I Will Be, released March 30.
As the Dum Dum Girls are often criticized for the monotony of their lo-fi “blissed-out buzz saw” sound, those involved in the production of I Will Be intended to increase the likability of their sound while maintaining the genius of Dee Dee’s songwriting and without compromising her creative voice. Producer Richard Gottehrer, who has worked with revolutionary girl bands like Blondie, the Go-Go’s, and just recently the Ravonettes, successfully managed to do just that.
Those who chose to show up for the opening act last Monday were blown away by the spectacular sound. Lo-fi distortion took a second hand to Dee Dee’s incredible vocals, and the set list flowed easily from start to finish. After this incredible and unexpected performance, the audience was no doubt eager to see if the headliner, Girls, could top it.
Sadly, Girls didn’t quite earn the pedestal they had been placed on. It wasn’t that Girls played a particularly bad show; but bluntly put, they didn’t blow listeners away. They began the show with a slow and calming song and maintained this relaxed ambiance throughout their set. While the band did incorporate some random spurts of loud and heavy distortion within the set list, nothing about their performance was markedly high-energy. Those expecting to experience the fun and fattening feel of songs like “Lust for Life” and “Morning Light” would have been disappointed with the band’s live rendition.
Although the show may have failed to meet the expectations of those audience members prepared to hear the “10th best album of 2009,” it was still a set packed with talent. Lead singer/guitarist Christopher Owens did a spectacular job on vocals, and the songs themselves maintained that psychedelic quality that initially made the band’s debut album so popular.
While the set Girls played live seemed to be vastly different from the tracks on their album, the show was definitely enjoyable and worth watching. Be sure to catch Girls and the Dum Dum Girls on their U.S. tour, or the next time they visit Pittsburgh.

Venture over to the historic South Side of Pittsburgh, and you will soon be astounded by the diversity of establishments that this neighborhood provides. The streets are lined with restaurants and shops for all different tastes. While you can get a tattoo on one block and have a drink with a date on the next, don’t forget that the South Side is also known to have some of the best food in the city.
Off East Carson Street, there is a little restaurant that might catch your eye with its bright yellow umbrellas and simple name: the 17th Street Café. When customers walk in the door, they are always greeted with a smile and a hello — and if they happen to be regulars, they are more likely than not greeted by name and asked about their families. The intimate atmosphere and the size of the café, with an estimated seating occupancy of around 40 people, make it easily recognizable. While the walls are as bright as the umbrellas outside, the lighting indoors is at the perfect level to create a very personal experience while still allowing for an easy read of the plethora of options on the menu.
The café serves Italian cuisine, but by no means are their dishes plain old spaghetti-and-meatballs meals. The menu has a varied selection of appetizers, pasta, poultry, seafood, and even veal options. The pasta dishes come with a house salad that can be topped with your choice of dressing. The poultry entrees are served with your choice of soup or salad. Entrees start at around $15 and go all the way to $27. Appetizers are less than $10.
All food is made to order, meaning that it is easy to add or remove anything from an order as long as the ingredients are present in the kitchen. In a sense, everyone has the potential to be his or her own chef for the night.
A great way to start the meal is with zucchini planks: lightly breaded slices of zucchini fried and served with marinara sauce and lemon. The portion is large enough to tower over the plate, but the zucchini itself is light and delectable. (For those on a budget, there’s a coupon for $7 off on an appetizer. Just visit the café’s website before venturing over.) It was surprising to see that the portion sizes of the entrees weren’t the size that an Italian grandmother might force on you, but they were large enough. The restaurant keeps enough food coming to the table that by the time entrees are served, finishing a meal seems difficult. The sausage and pepper ravioli provides a kick of spice: The raviolis themselves are not stuffed with the traditional ricotta cheese, but instead are filled with a paste of cheeses and Sicilian sausage. The chicken prosciutto is also very good, served over your choice of pasta and cooked in a creamy sauce. The servers also make sure to keep customers satisfied with a constant supply of warm bread throughout the meal.
Desserts are brought out on a platter and cover a variety of options, including cheesecakes, cobblers served with ice cream, and freshly made cannoli, all of which have tempting flaky golden crusts and creamy toppings. All in all, a meal is under $25 after using the coupon.
The experience doesn’t end just because dinner is over. When the check is brought to the table, it comes with pens. The pens read, “Bring this stolen pen... back to 17th Street Café for a free order of Fried Zucchini...” — a good way to bring customers back. There is also a rewards program that sends members gifts and discounts for just about every holiday and special occasion that the owner can think of, including his wife’s birthday!
If you are looking for a place to have a nice dinner with the family or a place to take your date, the 17th Street Café is the place to go. They have something for everyone. Looking for a place to have an intimate gathering with a large group of friends? There’s a separate section in the back that can seat around 15 to 20 people. If you’re a sports fan — and let’s face it, most Pittsburgh residents are — don’t worry about missing a game. There is a large-screen TV above the bar, which has a varied selection of wines and beers for patrons’ drinking pleasure.
Whether you’re looking for a place to feel like home or to impress a date, the 17th Street Café has it all: the great service, the varied menu, the friendly atmosphere, and the intimate feel. This is the kind of seemingly hole-in-the-wall restaurant that once discovered, you won’t want to share for the fear of losing it to popular demand. It is a place that you will want to go back to again and again, with friends, family, significant others, and just about anyone. It is a place where there won’t ever be a shortage of smiling faces greeting you at the door.
The 17th Street Café is located at 75 S. 17th St.

When fathers and sons enter the same professions, there’s a natural and — hopefully — friendly competition between them. The father usually paves a path to follow, and the son is challenged to meet and exceed the feats established by his dad. Now, substitute Bob Dylan in for the father, and imagine yourself as his son. Can’t be an easy job, can it? How exactly does one live up to — and surpass — one of the men who shaped the face of music? Jakob Dylan, now 40 years old and still working, embraces the relationship. His newest solo album, Women and Country, was just released on April 6, and Jakob has a good chance of stealing his father’s fans.
His latest release might best be described as the soundtrack of a snake charmer in St. Louis. With Middle Eastern influences and muted trumpets, it’s a beautiful hybrid of differing genres that can’t be found anywhere else.
The opening track, “Nothing But the Whole Wide World,” really sets the tone for what the remainder of the album will feel like. It’s a beautiful and gentle easing into the journey Dylan is about to take his listeners on. It gives the audience a chance to get acquainted with his heavy voice and his layered lyrics.
“Down Our Own Shield” features the angelic backing vocals of Neko Case and Kelly Hogan in harmony with Dylan’s smoky tones. It’s a touching ballad about staying strong in a fight, and the music complements the lyrics magnificently. A strong musical intro soon invites the male and female voices to sing against a steady background beat.
The standout song is “Lend a Hand.” The song as a whole is reminiscent of an old-time circus, while Dylan, like an eccentric ringleader, recounts a story to his audience in poetic verses and clever rhymes. The song begins with heavy rhythmic drumbeats, like the introduction of a tamed elephant entering the ring. Accompanied by a blaring trumpet and electric guitar riffs, Dylan sings, “Suppose I quit you, my wayward tribe, whatever would you do? Now take me to Hades, or take me to Memphis, just don’t take me for one of you.”
If you can picture a movie scene of a band of men crossing the Sahara with a large sun setting behind a mountain of sand, “We Don’t Live Here Anymore” would be the soundtrack to that moment. Singing about a forgotten town that’s gone to shambles, Dylan takes breaks to allow for the instrumentation.
“Everybody’s Hurting” again welcomes Dylan and his female vocals joined in beautiful harmony. Here, the background violin joins the prominent pungi — the instrument of snake charmers, with a sound like a cross between a bagpipe and a kazoo. Dylan writes of promises and dreams as kids, telling a story and remarking, “How sweet salvation sounds.”
Jakob’s voice in “Holy Rollers for Love” is scarily similar to his father’s in the opening verse, and the lyrics could definitely pass for something out of Bob’s songbook. Here, Jakob sings about symbols of peace among times of war (”Battle songs fill their lungs”).
If you don’t listen closely, it’s pretty easy to go through the album in its entirety thinking you’ve listened to the first track on repeat 11 times. However, if you look at the lyrics — which are Dylan’s undeniable strong suit — or think of each song separately, you’ll find there are a good deal of gems among what seem like just echoes.
One thing that’s for sure is that there is creative musical talent in the Dylan blood. Jakob not only wrote all the lyrics to the 11 songs on his new album, but he composed the music and arrangements as well. These Middle Eastern-meets-folk compilations are great if you’re feeling quirky or want to hear some quality lyrics.

As you browse the music on iTunes, you may have noticed the increasing popularity of movie and television soundtracks. Some of them have even been so brave as to invade the Top 10 Albums chart on iTunes. What is this new phenomenon?
Well, it really comes as no surprise that Glee: The Music, Volume 1, and Glee: The Music, Volume 2 have landed top spots on multiple music charts. Both albums have also been certified gold by the RIAA. The show won the 2010 Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series — Musical or Comedy. What makes this show so incredibly popular? It could be the stereotypical high school roles played by lead characters, or the underlying good versus evil tension between the geeky members of the glee club, the popular cheerleaders, and their leaders, Will Schuester and Sue Sylvester. But, more importantly, it’s the music that makes the show, and there is no doubt that Glee has a stellar soundtrack. With pop and show tunes, it’s a perfect mix of fun, new takes on songs often heard on the radio, and great classics.
Indie music has also made a surprisingly popular entrance into the world of soundtracks. Perhaps the rising popularity of indie films has something to do with this trend. One such recent hit soundtrack is that of 500 Days of Summer. The film has been nominated for many awards, and it made numerous “Top 10” year-end lists for 2009, and having a great soundtrack didn’t hurt. The music pushed the film forward, sometimes providing background themes while at other times was the highlight of the scene. When Tom first meets Summer, she comments on his choice of music: The Smiths. In another scene, after Tom finally sleeps with Summer, the film adapts the techniques of musicals, where Tom dances through a park singing “You Make My Dreams” by Hall & Oates and people in the park join him in song. When their relationship reaches the pinnacle of happiness, Summer and Tom wander the city and all conversations and noise are muted while “Sweet Disposition” by Temper Trap is played. The movie does a wonderful job of highlighting the songs it uses, making the soundtrack a hit.
Another indie film that has garnered a lot of attention is Juno, the popular 2007 film that won a 2008 Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and was nominated for three other awards. The featured music is a perfect match for the film. The soundtrack is certified platinum, and peaked at number one on U.S Billboard 200. It won the 2009 Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for Motion Picture, Television, or Other Visual Media. When the director had asked Ellen Page, who plays Juno, what kind of music Page’s character would listen to, she suggested The Moldy Peaches. Kimya Dawson of The Moldy Peaches became the key behind the music, as many of her songs were featured in the film. The sound of the film was free-spirited and jangled — not always perfect, but with character, a reflection of Juno’s personality.
The similarity that all hit soundtracks feature is their ability to perfectly match the film or TV show in which the songs are used. Music provides a mood, be it tension, happiness, or easy-going. Although popular films may boost their soundtracks to prominence, it’s really the music that makes the film.

The following is an excerpt from public policy and management master’s student Ryan Donnelly’s blog account of his travels in abroad. Feel free to visit *www.postcardsfromstrangeplaces.com if you would like to read more.*
Being fortunate enough to have traveled across the six or seven continents this world has to offer, I like to think that I’ve seen a thing or two. But I knew that this journey was going to be one for the record books when the 1985 short bus pulled up at 6 a.m. and I saw the man behind the wheel. With the glare of the rising sun radiating off of his dark black sunglasses, a smiling, sunburned, mustached man was finishing off what appeared to be his third Red Bull of the morning.
Half asleep, I threw my bags into the attached trailer and climbed aboard. Five minutes later, my prior estimation was confirmed. Laughing hysterically, Mark sped off driving the wrong way down a one-way alley, honking at a cab that was trying to use the street in the generally accepted manner, and running the bus down the road with two wheels on the sidewalk.
We were departing for a seven-day journey into the outback, and the driver Mark (pronounced in Aussie as “Maahck”) couldn’t have been more pleased. This was exceptional, considering we were departing for a two-day, 1500-mile drive due north over mostly unpaved roads into arguably the single most inhospitable place on the planet. Armed with a head full of knowledge, an evil laugh, and a matching green-fatigue army shirt complete with some well-worn shorts that were so small that I felt uncomfortable being on the same street as him, the 50-plus-year-old road warrior rocketed his rattling steed off into the desert. And wow, could that bus move. Exhausted, I was slipping in and out of a light sleep to the sound of an odd mix of techno and disco-fused tracks playing from his iPod when I was jolted awake by our vehicle lurching violently to the right and our bus passing a smaller car on the shoulder, right as a road train (think tractor trailer with two to five additional trailers attached) swerved past us. Everyone else woke up looking as if half of them had wet their pants, and so I asked:
“Everything all right up there, Mark?”
He turned down the music and looked up into the rear-view mirror and smiled, saying, “You bet, mate! No dramas (pronounced draaah-maz) — I reckon we’ll survive (suh-voyve) this drive (droyve),” and with a hysterical, evil laugh he turned around completely to spend more than a few seconds peering at his passengers, without once slowing down or looking at the road. Mark then turned back to face the stereo and realized the bus was heading straight towards a large boulder. Artfully, he turned the wheel to the left and guided us back onto the road, as if this was as normal as brushing your teeth. I looked down and searched in vain to find something with which I could fasten myself to the chair or floor in the absence of seatbelts.
A few hours later, and the shouting began once again as Mark said, “We will be stopping up here a ways, so you all better (bettah) use the toilets and get some water. Two liters. Minimum. Three is better. Because after that, we’re in the land of big hats, big heat, and big flies. You won’t be finding any more shade or toilets out here, mate. Where we’re going, it’s just us and the outback. Something happens, and it will be at least eight hours (owas) before a plane will be able to get out here, find you, and get you back to a hospital. At least eight hours, mate. And that’s if the dingos don’t get you first.” And with that customary laugh, he adjusted his big straw hat and looked forward again, realizing that the bus was still speeding down the road.
When we stopped, Mark filled up the bus with gas, and then filled two extra containers as well. Just in case we ran out. The heat was over 100°F, and it wasn’t even noon. Plus, we had only entered the desert an hour or two before. I ran inside the station and came out with a Snickers bar. I started chatting with Mark and asked him about where he grew up. He said that he grew up on a station just like the one we were at. A station, he explained, is different from a farm. A station is entirely self-sufficient and is called so because it is much larger than any farm is. The outback, he explained, has a fair number of them — the biggest of which is larger in size than Belgium and has somewhere between 60,000-70,000 heads of cattle, many of which have never seen a human being before. When it comes time to round them up, station-heads have to use helicopters.
Many of these remote outposts also have a gas station, but the primary business is often sheep or cattle farming. Generally, only one or two families live on a station, hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of kilometers away from the next-nearest station, town, or city. Mark and his eight brothers and sisters grew up with only each other and a handful of aboriginals that worked on their land with them to keep company. They got their education from School of the Air, which were half-hour school sessions that took place over radio broadcast three times per week. Children all across the outback would tune in during those times, and after the broadcast could ask questions via radio. Homework assignments were written and mailed to the school to be graded and eventually returned. The first time he saw a TV was 18 years ago.
Mark spent a lot of his youth reading and working on the land. Additionally, having grown up with many aboriginals, he knew a lot about their history and customs. He explained some of the expert survival tactics in the punishing outback heat that had been passed down through generations. These people survived for thousands of years in some of the hottest places on earth, where there is virtually no water or shade, living off extremely scarce resources. Australia is the driest continent on the planet. Eighty percent of it is desert, and the country is the same size as the U.S. When I say that going through the outback is big, hot, and remote, I mean it. The heat can get in excess of 140°F, and the road temperature can get over 150°F, melting the pavement.
After two days of driving and a night spent in the middle of the outback sleeping under the stars — taking turns keeping watch at night to keep the dingos away — we arrived in Coober Pedy — the Opal Capital of the World. It’s a place so hot and desolate that much of their population of 2000 lives underground in what they call “dugouts.” A community of miners, they fashion their homes in the same manner they make their mines. We slept underground, too.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
Girls are intimidating. I see them walking around everywhere; but I don’t know how to talk to them. How do I strike up a conversation? How can I avoid being a creep? And what about cooties?
Sincerely,
—Talking to Women Is Terrifying
Dear TWIT,
Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and reach deep down inside yourself. Do you feel that? Those are your testicles. You’re a man — start acting like one. As shocking as this may seem, girls are people too. Just strike up a conversation and contain your panic long enough to get her number before the dry heaves kick in. You don’t want to be creepy? Respect her personal space, take the hint when she wants you to leave, look her in the eyes, and approach her in a space where she can easily run if you are in fact a creep.
Okay, so you’ve said hello. This is where you use all your suave and charm. Introduce yourself and get her name. Talk about something you both have in common. Don’t stare at her chest. Make her laugh. Don’t stare at her chest. Remember — the worst that can happen is that she ignores you. And cooties? It’s called VD, and there’s a reason we have Health Services.
Sack up and talk to girls before you die alone,
—Patrick Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I am a professor from the School of Computer Science. I wanted some student advice as to why the lecture hall empties out whenever I stand up to lecture.
Thank you,
—Ready to Open Books and Other Tools
Dear ROBOT,
It might help if your students learned to respect you. Think back over the course of the semester — did you do anything to lose their respect? Things like not knowing what you were teaching or interrupting the other professor might have done it. In short, did you come off as well-informed and knowledgeable about the information you were teaching, or did you look like you got the job at the last minute and had failed to prepare?
But that’s enough dwelling in the past — you need to move on. How can you get back your students’ respect? Start by showing them that you’re actually prepared. Give a lecture on something you specialize in. Hold it on a day when you have a quiz and then bar the doors. Sure, that might get you in trouble with the fire department, but what’s more important — having a class full of happy students, or getting out alive?
Testy teaching,
—Brian Hoskins

Folk artists are migrating to Portland, and hip-hop artists are finding their scene in Baltimore. Popular music is no longer about dominating the charts; it’s about commanding a region. 
While the Internet has helped musicians find audiences beyond borders, artists are always looking for a place to call home. They want friends to collaborate with and live audiences to play in front of.
With that in mind, some cities are becoming musical safe havens, while other cities are becoming musical dry spots. Places like Toronto, Canada have brought together super groups like Broken Social Scene. Sometimes borrowing members from bands all across Canada, Broken Social Scene plays with as few as six members to as many as 19 members. The band even has popular artists like Leslie Feist in its mix. 
As of yet, Pittsburgh isn’t exactly dry, but most good musicians don’t stay in the city long. Oftentimes it feels like artists only stop by Pittsburgh on their way to New York.
This is all so unfortunate because Pittsburgh has the potential to explode on the music scene. Few cities support their artists as much as we do, and even fewer can match our affordable housing. Our city is the perfect place for emerging artists to collaborate and call home, so make a point to support local talent. Go see a show!

This week’s issue features an editorial criticizing the university’s lack of school spirit. Specifically, the authors lament the quality of the singing of the “Alma Mater” when Andrew Carnegie visited. Some things never seem to change.

This week’s issue notes that Student Congress is trying to change the judicial system from the current disorganized process to a more formal procedure. The writer notes that this is the “most important business of the year” and that students will have more control over their own discipline. Interesting take; however, this year’s voter turnout suggests otherwise.

The Sports section dedicated six pages to a 1985 baseball preview commentary this week. The story offers predictions about every Major League team, saying that the Detroit Tigers would beat the New York Mets in the World Series. In fact, the Kansas City Royals beat the St. Louis Cardinals. Oops?

An editorial this week notes that Dining Services is making sweeping changes in response to criticism about campus dining options. The Coalition for Dining’s New Atmosphere came up with several improvements that would be implemented in the coming months. If on-campus dining got better after 2000, I don’t want to know what it was like before.

A How Things Work article this week explains the science of beaches and “the wonderful world of coastal formation.” The author discusses the different types of waves and currents. All of this is no doubt useful to many Carnegie Mellon students who are too busy doing homework over spring break to actually visit a beach.

One News article this week investigates the consumption of caffeine at Carnegie Mellon. One professor stated that he usually drank about 10 small cups of coffee per day, while another lamented the withdrawal symptoms she experienced when trying to avoid the beverage. Why give up the only thing that keeps you awake during that 8:30 a.m. history lecture?

Though you are not appropriately sized for Buggy, you may be able to set a record if you remove your legs.
Your booth, though regarded as the best on Midway, will be disqualified because the upper deck is an eighth of an inch too far to the left.
Attending the Carnival concert is a terrible idea; your attempt to start a mosh pit will lead to a concussion and a missing canine tooth.
Winning booth games is trivially easy for you. Unfortunately, everybody thinks that you cheat, and you don't get anything for it.
Your Carnival weekend will be punctuated by a surprise visit from your parents. Instead of a weekend of booths and debauchery, you will spend most of your time touring Pittsburgh's museums.
A tragic fire will destroy your booth, but in a sitcom-esque all-night marathon, you and five friends will rebuild the entire thing. However, a second tragic fire will destroy that as well.
Your death at the hands of a crazed Carnival committee member is tragic and will be remembered by the massive bloodstain left on Midway.
Add your own blood into the red paint on your booth. That way, you can sell pieces of it to your fans 15 years in the future.
Change your booth plans to include the image of Gandhi in a top hat and a zoot suit.
This year, like so many others before, will result in a booth collapse. Unfortunately, this year it is your turn. Nobody is injured, but your pride will never recover.
Instead of watching Buggy, fly to Barcelona and watch a bullfight. Those are more fun anyway.
The Carnival concert will be awesome for you. Joining the mosh pit is the best thing you could do. You may even give someone a concussion.

This summer, students will have the opportunity to develop their own Facebook or iPhone applications at Carnegie Mellon’s Silicon Valley campus in the 12-week course 96-800: Real World Software Engineering for Entrepreneurs.
The class will be taught by adjunct professor Scott Russell and Director of Software Engineering Todd Sedano. Russell and Sedano graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 1982 and 1996, respectively, both receiving degrees in mathematics and computer science.
There are few courses available to undergraduates at Carnegie Mellon that blur the line between the classroom and the real world.
“CMU teaches many first-rate courses in software engineering and entrepreneurship,” Russell stated. “However, for students who want to start a software company some day, the opportunity to learn from experienced entrepreneurs and venture capitalists while living in Silicon Valley is unique.”
Students in 96-800 will build an original application, present it to a real venture capital firm, post it on Facebook or the iPhone App Store, and finally be graded on the success and profitability of the application. 
Sedano described it as “American Idol for geeks where VCs [venture capitalists] play the role of Simon Cowell.”
While building an original and profitable application for Facebook or the iPhone in just 12 weeks certainly sounds difficult, Sedano and Russell stress how Facebook and the iPhone are easy platforms to work with and have much potential.
“We all know that the best software applications are easy to use. We believe the key to making it easy is to get customer feedback early and often. The Facebook and iPhone platforms now allow you to do just that,” Russell said. Understanding the marketplace is a key aspect of making a successful application, added Sedano. “Right now successful Facebook apps are mostly casual games. The larger screen of the iPad is a fundamental game changer for iPhone development.”
Both Sedano and Russell stressed a very customer-centric approach when developing applications. 
“The course is encouraging student teams to develop and launch a Facebook or iPhone application because it is possible to build simple applications quickly and get real customer feedback,” explained Russell.
“Determine who is your target user group and figure out what problem you are solving for them. If possible, start talking to people who might use your product. Work out paper prototypes and show them to people.”
“The course attracted me as the best learning program on how to build a profitable software business from an idea,” said master’s student Reggie Nair, who will be taking the course. “Being an experienced software engineer, I know how to win the technical challenges. However, the steps to raise funds, marketing, and revenue generation are a mystery.”
Interested students are expected to form groups of two to four prior to enrollment in the course. Although building any type of software should require a team with at least one member with proven computer skills, Sedano encourages other majors to join as well. “I’d love to see teams with people from different colleges,” he said. “Spend time trying to form a team with people of different skill sets.” The course itself is open to any Carnegie Mellon students regardless of degree, focus, or year, so long as the student is in a team.
Space in the course is extremely limited. Any students planning to submit an application should e-mail Sedano at todd.sedano@sv.cmu.edu. For more details, check out www.96800.sv.cmu.edu.

What is ranked as the number-one fear among human beings?
Jonathan Fields, former private equity attorney turned lifestyle entrepreneur, informed his audience that it was, amusingly enough, “the fear of public speaking.” Fields spoke at the TEDx conference, hosted by Carnegie Mellon on Sunday, April 4.
TEDx is a relatively new program that allows local communities such as schools, businesses, libraries, and neighborhoods to organize, design, and host their own independent event using the annual Technology, Entertainment, Design (TED) conference model. The “x” in TEDx stands for “independently organized TED event.” TEDxCMU was one of the many mini spin-offs of the annual TED talks that are held in locations around the world. The original TED event aimed to bring together luminaries who are often unacknowledged in the fields of science, politics, philanthropy, business, and art.
A team of 11 students organized the Carnegie Mellon-centered event, overseen by Yongho Shin, a junior business administration major, and Sachit Gupta, a senior information systems major. “When I saw it online, I thought how amazing would it be if instead of just watching the talks online we could actually bring it here and have people actually sit in the place [where] it was happening,” Shin said.
The theme of this particular conference was “being fearless.” “I decided on the theme fearless,” Shin said, “because I thought it was a quality people can benefit from, and by bringing people that have done fearless things I wanted people to learn from that. We want the guests to actually think about what they are hearing and leave with something that they didn’t have before.”
“And use that to sort of do something later on. We want them to learn something that they can use to change something in the world,” Gupta added.
The presentations took place in McConomy Auditorium in the University Center last Sunday from 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. As expected, there was a lot of interest for the event, but unfortunately seating was limited. As a result, over 200 people were denied a seat in the 450-seat auditorium. “We were surprised by the response,” Gupta said when asked about the possibility of making more seats available. Speeches at the event were capped at 18 minutes, and there were no question-and-answer sessions. Speakers were not paid for the appearance and received no compensation for their travel expenses. What’s more, speakers had to sit in the audience before their talk, and no laptops were allowed for note-taking.
Emcee Aman Chawla led and organized the conference. Chawla described the conference as a great opportunity for Carnegie Mellon and the community in general. “It increases CMU’s presence in a public light by bringing such illustrious alumni to the campus and by bringing so many people to CMU to see this, which I think is fantastic for the community and CMU,” Chawla said.
TEDxCMU speaker, cartoonist, and multi-disciplinary artist Raghava Kalyanaraman, better known as Raghava KK, was no stranger to TED. Just two months ago, in February, KK shared the spotlight alongside Bill Gates and Sheryl Crowe at the TED conference in Long Beach, Calif. “I am no authority on how to handle fear, but I have some instances on how to deal with fear,” KK said. “I use fear to motivate me. One of my philosophies is that if you want to do something, do it now. If you don’t have what it takes to do it, acquire it. Don’t second-guess yourself. Learn from your past.”
Apart from Fields and KK, the other speakers at the event included Carnegie Mellon alumnus and CEO of two Pittsburgh-based companies Robert F. Culberston III, blogger and world traveler Chris Guillebeau, Carnegie Mellon faculty member and former Walt Disney imagineer Mk Haley, photographer and social artist Chase Jarvis, Carnegie Mellon alumnus and CEO of Pittsburgh-based Deeplocal Nathan Martin, and Carnegie Mellon alumnus and entrepreneur Stacey Monk.
Their talks covered a variety of topics with personal experiences and anecdotes, all with the ultimate aim of spreading the lessons the speakers had learned about being fearless. Culberston, surprising the audience with a rap, spoke about the importance of saving money because of the power of compound interests. 
Guillebeau, on the other hand, tried to encourage fearlessness by recounting the path his career had taken. Each speaker had something different to offer, and each had learned the importance of being fearless through different experiences. There is no doubt that their inspirational tales and messages will have made an impact on their audience.
In addition to Shin and Gupta, TEDxCMU team members included: Tejasvi Ashok, a chemical engineering master’s student; Shivaas Gulati, a master’s student at the Institute for Software Research; Shivranjani Gupta, a first-year economics major; Krish Ajmera, a sophomore business administration major; Varun Srinivasan, a senior H&SS interdisciplinary major; Nipun Gupta, a master’s student at the Information Networking Institute; Brian Yee, a sophomore H&SS interdisciplinary major; and Juliana Diaz, a design master’s student.

Imagine sitting at your computer, with the world at your fingertips, and being able to explore historic Gettysburg and see where Abraham Lincoln once spoke “four score and seven years ago.” Perhaps you’d like to take a trip down a Civil War soldier’s memory lane to Little Round Top to see where a great battle was once waged.
Thanks to recent developments in Gigapan technology and Google Earth, this dream is now a reality. Pennsylvania Civil War trails are now viewable in Google Earth. Gigapan is a high-resolution image technology developed in part by Carnegie Mellon, the NASA Ames Research Center, Google, Gigapan Systems, and Deep Local, Inc. It is a part of Carnegie Mellon’s Global Connection Project initiative, which, according to the project’s website, “develops software tools and technologies to increase the power of images to connect, inform, and inspire people to become engaged and responsible global citizens.”
Gigapans, short for “gigapixel panoramas,” are extremely high-resolution images that are taken using a robotic mount for a digital camera and state-of-the-art software. Gigapan’s mission, “to make all aspects of the Gigapan experience accessible and affordable to the broadest possible community,” is now coming to life through the use of Google Earth, which is free to use from any computer.
Gigapans of Pennsylvania Civil War trails are the first of their kind to be featured on Google Earth. Along with historic battlefields, other aspects of Pennsylvania’s Civil War history are viewable in Gigapans, including cemeteries, monuments, and museum exhibits.
Not everyone supports the idea that visiting a museum through your computer screen is a brilliant invention, however. First-year history major Isabel Smith-Bernstein, who comes from a family of individuals involved with museum management and conservation, spoke out against the Gigapans. “I think [the Gigapans are] stupid, because it takes away the experience of actually going there. It takes away the impact of actually standing in the same space as hundreds of Civil War soldiers,” she said. “There’s a certain feeling that you get when you’re at place with so much history, and that will just go away. Since the youth of today already are alarmingly disinterested in history, this will only increase that disinterest, since there’s no more impact — no punch. Just another computer screen with some pictures. It makes the travel less important.”
George Cornelius, secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development, pointed out some positives of the Gigapans, a development that he believes will allow Pennsylvania to emerge as a leader in the tourism industry. “This new tool for Pennsylvania Civil War trails will allow Pennsylvania to solidify its position as an industry ‘thought leader’ in tourism by not just embracing emerging technologies, but by building them,” Cornelius said in a press release on Carnegie Mellon’s website.
A former anthropology major, sophomore Chrissy Swierkocki wondered how much further this technology can go. 
“Hopefully other parts of the country and the world can utilize this technology in their own historic areas,” she commented. “Especially with museums, it’d be great to have those resources available online.”

Have you ever had an experience with a true “hero” on campus, whether in the classroom, on a service project, or in your daily life? With the new Carnegie Heroes Program, sponsored by student government and Carnegie Mellon’s service fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega, now is your chance to recognize the heroes in your life. “We will be distributing applications in the next week and asking students to tell us about people who they believe should be nominated as a hero,” said Angel Gonzalez, a junior social and decision sciences major and member of Alpha Phi Omega.
Students, faculty, or staff at Carnegie Mellon who have had an impact can be nominated. An individual can be nominated to be a hero for numerous reasons, not solely based on community service. All that is required to submit a nomination is an application found on the student government website (https://stugov.andrew.cmu.edu) and a 250-word explanation as to why the nominated person is worthy of being called a “Carnegie Hero.”
The Carnegie Heroes program originated from senior H&SS interdisciplinary social and decision sciences major Rotimi Abimbola, the student body president.
“In the fall semester, after hearing of many instances and stories about members of the campus community performing extraordinary acts of kindness and goodwill, I came up with the idea of creating a program that celebrates service and building community on campus,” Abimbola said.
Alpha Phi Omega and the student government had already cooperated on the Help Haiti Campaign and found another good opportunity to combine their strengths with the Carnegie Heroes program. 
A committee consisting of students from both Alpha Phi Omega and student government will determine who is to be honored at the third annual President’s Dinner.
With recognition now being offered to those who perform myriad good deeds on campus, student government and Alpha Phi Omega hope students will use this opportunity to learn more about the various types of service offered on campus. 
Medini Annavajhala, a sophomore in the Science and Humanities Scholars program, and the AmeriCorps Service Scholar for this school year, felt the award program would have a positive effect.
“I think highlighting the fact that there is actually community service on campus will make people more willing to give up part of their own time and put in time to work towards a better and more cohesive community,” Annavajhala said. 
As one of two AmeriCorps Scholars on campus, Annavajhala’s work on campus is dedicated to developing service programs and supporting the campus service organizations among other initiatives.
Information about the Carnegie Heroes program can be obtained by e-mailing carnegieheroes@gmail.com or by joining the program’s Facebook event. 
Paper copies of the application can be found at stugov.andrew.cmu.edu/executive/news/2010/nominate-your-carnegie-hero.html. Forms can then be turned into any of the boxes that have been placed in the University Center and at the Heinz and Tepper buildings.

Campaign to recruit alumni
“Loyal Scot” banners appeared across campus in recent weeks, featuring a “Plaid to the Bone” slogan. 
The campaign, sponsored by the Carnegie Mellon Alumni Association, aims to keep alumni connected to the university and focuses on four steps: staying informed, getting involved, giving back, and showing Carnegie Mellon pride. 
The program offers alumni easy ways to complete each of the steps, such as by volunteering as a local recruiter or by nominating someone for an alumni award.
The Loyal Scot program also offers recognition for attending Carnegie Mellon events. The next major event is Carnival this week. Reunions will be held by decade for all Carnegie Mellon classes. Alumni events include a golf outing as well as standard Carnival events like Buggy.
After returning home, alumni are encouraged to stay involved and volunteer within their regional communities. Some of these recommendations are alumni-focused, such as volunteering to serve on reunion committees or joining an alumni interest group. Alumni can also sign up to help recruit students from their areas.
Interested students and alumni can visit www.cmu.edu/loyalscot or e-mail loyal-scot@andrew.cmu.edu for more information about the program.
Scottish heritage honored
As part of Scotland Week 2010, Scottish Education Minister Michael Russell spoke in the Peter/Wright/McKenna rooms in the University Center last Monday. Russell’s talk, titled “Scotland — A New Future Building on a Great Past,” discussed the common ties shared between Carnegie Mellon and Scotland, as well as the referendum bill in Scotland. The bill and Russell’s speech addressed Scottish autonomy and independence.
Scotland Week, which ran from April 3 to 10, is an annual event planned by the Scottish government in which ministers travel around the United States and Canada to spread awareness of and celebrate Scottish culture. Three Scottish government ministers traveled to North America to promote the themes of Scotland Week, including the theme of "Great Scots and Innovation," which drew strong connections to Carnegie Mellon.
The subjects of Russell’s talk have generated controversy in the United Kingdom, with many opposition leaders in Scotland criticizing the minister’s advocacy of independence on a taxpayer-funded trip.
For more information on Russel's visit, go to [SLANT12]http://www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2010/March/march24_scottishofficial.shtml[SLANT12]

In a surprising and yet not-so-surprising move, the government in its new health care bill decided to include $250 million in abstinence-only education funding.
Why is it surprising? Well, this bill is being called a liberal bill and it was passed almost solely by Democrats, yet it contains perhaps one of the most conservative ideas about education.
Further, the Planned Parenthood website, which seems to be slightly out-of-date regarding this issue, claims that “President Obama’s 2010 budget will end funding for ineffective abstinence-only programs and provide $178 million for evidence-based sex education programs that prevent teen pregnancy” (www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/positions/fighting-real-sex-education-97.htm).
As a conservative, I’ll be the first to admit that I don’t usually support Obama’s initiatives, but this one had promise. Educating teenagers about their bodies and how to protect them is a great idea. Instead of following through with this promising idea, though, the administration decided to go in the opposite direction, choosing instead to provide funding for abstinence-only education.
Unfortunately, though, this move can’t be all that surprising to anyone. For years, the government has been providing extra funding to schools that promise to teach abstinence-only sex education.
Has this solved any of our teen pregnancy problems? No. Is it likely to stop teenagers from having sex? No, probably not.
Regardless of what you tell — or don’t tell — teenagers in school about sex, they will continue to make their own choices about their bodies. Since this is the case, and since a vast majority (some sources cite over 70 percent) of teenagers do decide to have sex, it is important that we teach them about proper contraception and all of the risks involved with making this decision.
In arguing for comprehensive sex education in schools, no one is trying to encourage teenagers to have sex. They don’t need anyone to encourage them.
The point of this kind of sex education is to inform teenagers about the possible risks of being sexually active and to educate them about methods of birth control and sexually transmitted infection (STI) protection.
Without this kind of sex education, we cannot expect teen pregnancy or teen STI rates to decline.
If we do not educate teenagers about safe sex, we cannot properly protect them from the dangers that sex presents. These dangers and risks include pregnancy and STIs — including HIV/AIDS — in addition to possible emotional and psychological complications resulting from having sex when they aren’t ready.
We cannot go on assuming that teenagers won’t have sex because we tell them they shouldn’t. That hasn’t stopped them before, and it won’t stop them now.
Funding abstinence-only education programs is a waste of our money. Further, it only hurts our entire society to allow teenagers to engage in sexual activity — including and going beyond intercourse — without being aware of how they can do it safely.
Some proponents of comprehensive sex education advocate using funding to provide teenagers with free condoms and other forms of contraception, but I think this goes a little too far. Schools should not provide free birth control to their students, but they should not withhold information about contraception that might benefit students. This includes information about where they can go to get free or inexpensive contraception, like Planned Parenthood or other local clinics.
If we don’t teach teens about sex, they’ll get their information from less reliable sources, like the Internet, magazines, and TV. What will they learn from these sources? Likely not the same things they would learn from experts.
Magazines like Cosmopolitan urge readers to try out new sex tricks on their significant others, and cable networks are full of sexual content. There are several TV shows that focus on teen parenthood, both factual (MTV’s Teen Mom and 16 and Pregnant) and fictional (ABC Family’s The Secret Life of an American Teenager). If teenagers watch these shows in lieu of proper sex education, they may get the wrong idea about sex. Some of these shows glamorize teen parenthood in ways that factual information would not.
Teenagers are going to learn about sex and be aware of all of the good aspects that these sources will show them, but they will be uneducated about the risks and possible pitfalls of sexual activity.
By keeping the focus on not having sex rather than on how to have it safely, teen pregnancy rates will not decrease as intended. Comprehensive sex education would likely reduce the rate of teen pregnancy as well as the risk of teens and young adults acquiring STIs.
Sex is everywhere. Teenagers will be exposed to it, whether or not we teach it to them. The question is where we want them to learn about it, and from whom.
Amanda Cole (acole@) is a senior in English and history and admits to occasionally watching MTV reality shows. She welcomes all responses.

If French President Nicolas Sarkozy has his way, wearing Islamic veils in France might become illegal. 
Sarkozy was quoted in a New York Times article as saying that the veil is “not welcome in France.” He further claimed that such garments oppress women and reduce these women’s dignity. As of now, no law has been passed, and the resolution to ban the veil will be debated in the French parliament in May. According to a BBC article, the ban’s purpose is also “for security reasons, to combat fraud, and to meet the needs of some public services.” However, if the law is passed, it will be a stark violation of many individuals’ right to freedom of religion. 
This isn’t the first time France has tried its hand at forcing secularism upon its citizens. In 2004, the country passed a law that prohibited headscarves and veils in public schools. For the many French Muslim women, the veil is probably not a symbol of oppression or lack of dignity; rather, it is a way of identifying themselves as part of a group of which they are proud members. 
With nearly 5 million Muslims, France boasts the largest Muslim population in Western Europe. By preventing such a large portion of its population from expressing its beliefs publicly, Sarkozy is setting a dire example in terms of complying with fundamental human rights.
Secularism means that a nation does not endorse any religion, but it does not mean that a nation become intolerant of any particular religious group. Sarkozy sees the oppression of women as a problem furthered by the use of veils, but it is surprising that he cannot see the bigger problem that will arise if this law is enforced. 
By passing such a law, the French government will not only incur the wrath of the millions of Muslims living in France, but also of Muslims in other parts of the world. And it is not only Muslims who will have a problem with this decision — believers in freedom of religion all over the world will find France’s decision disturbing.

Last week, Wikileaks — a site that allows whistle-blowers to submit documents anonymously — released a video that shows an Apache helicopter kill a gathering of unarmed civilians in Iraq. The video is a classified military document that, as the name of the website implies, was leaked by an anonymous source, verified by the Wikileaks staff, and then published to the Internet.
Among the roles of journalists in society are to report on the actions of governments, to expose internal corruption, and to balance the power that a government holds over its citizens by exposing the truth of their actions. Yet every news organization must make choices on what to report, and how to deal with covering the government that it operates within.
Two Reuters journalists were killed in the 2007 attack shown in the video, but no Freedom of Information Act filing from Reuters was able to uncover any details about the attack. It took the protection of anonymity and a report filed from an unnamed source to bring out a truth that the American government would likely have preferred not to have been publicized.
We ask, with the Internet revolutionizing society, if this is the future of investigative journalism. This future might rely on verified, trusted sites across the Internet that protect contributors from retribution and are open to people with controversial information. Not only does this have a huge amount of potential power to create change by doing it from the outside, there is demonstrated financial support for the method. In the last week, Wikileaks has raised $150,000.
Wikileaks has, in just a few years, unearthed information from Sarah Palin’s Yahoo! account, the correspondence on climate research, and 570,000 pager messages sent during the Sept. 11 attacks. Wikileaks deserves the attention it has been getting and the respect of people everywhere who believe information should be free.

When I heard that Scrabble was ostensibly amending its rules to allow the use of proper nouns, my first reaction was one of sorrow. I woke up to the report on NPR — which is of course where any good Scrabble player should get his or her news — and quickly followed my gut instinct: to search on Amazon for the price of the Scrabble Diamond Anniversary set, figuring that its black tiles would adequately mark my eternal period of mourning.
It only takes one decision to ruin a legacy of greatness, and this would be no exception. The game is sold in 121 countries in 29 different language versions. Worldwide, over 150 million sets have been sold, and sets are found in one out of every three American homes. The rules of Scrabble haven’t been changed since 1989, and even then it was nothing to get excited about: If final scores are tied, the game is ruled a tie and each player is credited with half a win. And now, in 2010, an amendment that allows proper nouns?
I decided that my Scrabble career was officially over. Forget about any future competitive play. 
With the inclusion of proper nouns, the pre-eminent word masters (and yes, they exist — just wait for this year’s Scrabble World Championships) would likely be a combination of 13-year-old girls, sports fanatics, and comparison shoppers. 
Gone would be the days of bookworms and linguistics masters — how can a (slightly altered) dictionary list of words compete with millions of celebrities, brand names, and sports stars with names like Azubuike? (That’s a Z, a B, and a K.) And to prove my point, I will admit that in order to create that last example I had to Google “NBA players.”
How can a word like “qat” (a tropical evergreen plant whose leaves are used as a stimulant), historically recognized for its usage of a Q with no U, compete with the never-ending list of proper nouns that fit into the same category: Qatar, Qantas, Qimonda, and QVC, to name a few.
A spokesperson for Mattel, originally quoted in the UK’s Daily Mail, may make my point better than I can.
“The new quirks will level the playing field.... Experienced players with a vast vocabulary could be equally pitted against players with a love of celebrity or football.”
Who wants an even playing field? I mean, this is just a matter of morals. “Bedazzle” on a triple word score? That’s 57 points, and — obviously — if someone were to play this word, they would just have used all of their tiles, which adds a 50-point bonus, for a total of 107 points — for a word whose definition involves “as seen on TV” labels and rhinestones. As I said, immoral.
But then the real facts came out, reassuring me about my future in competitive Scrabble.
Mattel, which owns the rights to Scrabble outside of North America, is introducing a game called “Scrabble Trickster,” which will allow proper nouns. The game will include cards that allow players to spell words backward and steal letters from opponents, among other nontraditional moves. 
The game will not be available in North America, where Hasbro owns Scrabble. Trickster, we can safely conclude, will be an unnecessary addition to an ever-growing list of unfortunate knock-offs.
Which means no one cares — Scrabble remains unchanged (at least for the moment). We bookworms can continue to collect obscure assortments of words with ideal vowel-to-consonant ratios, while the 13-year-old girls and sports fanatics (a good word in itself for 26 on a double word) can play Scrabble Trickster.
However, I applaud the quick reaction of the news media (NPR, CBS, the BBC, The Telegraph, The Times in London, and The Daily Mail, to name a few) and revel in the fact that I was not alone in my temporary panic-induced insanity. Millions entertained the idea that the addition of proper nouns could destroy a long-loved and enduring tradition.
Which is precisely why I am proud to call myself a member of the National Scrabble Association. So don’t try to beat my quixotry with your Quentin.

Working on Spring Carnival Committee (SCC) has been a very exciting and enriching experience. SCC delegates its tasks to its 14 subcommittees, so almost every member of SCC is a chair or co-chair. Even if it’s your first time working on the committee, you’re given a fair amount of responsibility. But there’s also a lot of support from other committee members when you need help or just aren't sure how something works.
As chair, I watch the big picture of Carnival and make sure everything is coming together as needed. This includes watching over the subcommittees to make sure everyone is on track, and helping them along when they need it. I also end up doing some special projects that don’t fall under any of the subcommittees.
Despite all of the work that SCC does, most of it is meaningless without the over 30 organizations that build booths. SCC works hard to organize the entertainment on Midway, the fireworks show, and other aspects of Carnival, but a large component of what we do is to support the Booth competition.
Last Friday, everyone building booths moved on to the Morewood parking lot with pieces of their booths so they can finish building them and have them ready to open on Thursday. What makes Booth amazing is not just the impressive design of these structures and the thought put into them, but the hard work and dedication of all those who build booths. Every booth that you see on Midway is thought up, designed, and built by students here at Carnegie Mellon.
Booth is an experience that benefits both the people building booths and the campus community. In the process of building a booth, students get a chance to learn skills they might not otherwise have, such as electrical wiring, framing a wall, or other carpentry skills. Booth, and the rest of Midway, also provides a wonderful experience for everyone on campus and all of our neighbors to have fun, relax, and enjoy the great work put into the booths.
At the very least, I encourage everyone to visit Midway this week during Carnival. But to get the full experience of Carnival, you should really get more involved, whether you help build a booth, work on a Buggy team, or do something else.
If you’re interested in doing something for Carnival, but you don’t want to build booths, getting involved with SCC is a great way to participate. If you have any questions relating to Carnival, send an e-mail to sc0v@andrew.cmu.edu.

The Internet is the future.
We can’t predict how it will evolve or what it will do to society, but it isn’t going away anytime soon. Its growth is astounding. Many people rely entirely on streaming videos on sites like Hulu to keep up with TV shows, not to mention doing constructive work like watching Keyboard Cat. Yet many Internet service providers (ISPs) want to restrict the freedom of the Internet, and a recent court decision allows them to do just that.
The decision last Tuesday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia deals with net neutrality and how the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is able to enforce it. Specifically, it holds that the FCC does not have the authority to stop ISPs from having absolute control over their networks. The FCC previously ordered Comcast to stop limiting traffic on its network.
Net neutrality does not have a single definition, but it generally refers to opposition to the practice of prioritizing certain types of Web content over others. For example, companies that oppose net neutrality often want to slow down (or “throttle”) high-bandwidth content that congests their networks.
At first glance, throttling practices don’t seem unreasonable. After all, the corporate lawyers claim, the only people who download this kind of high-quality content are software pirates or computer enthusiasts. These regulations wouldn’t affect most people.
Assuming that by “most people,” you mean nobody who watches Hulu, or sports clips, or CNN video, or any of the other rich multimedia content available on the Web. Assuming that you think the way the Internet is now is the same way it will be for the next decade. Assuming that you think technology has reached its saturation point, where innovation is no longer needed.
Without net neutrality, ISPs will be able to decide what kind of content is most important. They will be able to slow down websites that compete with them. They will be able to charge sites to have fast transfer speeds, creating a tiered Internet that disallows startups without the money to pay protection to an ISP. This is not just hypothetical; it is already in business plans for telecommunications and cable giants.
Allowing prioritized Internet access and tiered networks will do grievous harm to the greatest source of knowledge, media, and innovation that exists today. It will discourage new ideas while promoting outdated business strategies.
The Internet is the future, but net neutrality is essential for making it a future controlled by users, not by corporate greed.

On March 23, www.gamecrush.com opened its virtual doors for a public beta. However, minutes later the site was down and the company claimed that the requests had overloaded its server capabilities. According to the company, they received over 10,000 requests in their first five minutes of operation. For those of you who are unfamiliar with GameCrush, the site offers to connect “Players” with “PlayDates” — essentially virtual escorts that are paid for their time — over their web-based Flash games or on Xbox Live — for a fee, of course.
The stereotype of a “gamer” — or, in GameCrush’s terminology, a Player — is of an unkempt, either morbidly obese or woefully emaciated, awkward, socially inept male firmly in the 18–35 demographic. However, this is simply not true anymore. In today’s world of causal games and widespread publicity surrounding video games — EA’s $3 million Dante’s Inferno Super Bowl ad in particular — the hardcore gamer demographic is spreading from Mom’s basement to the real world. GameCrush’s very existence stinks of catering to the lowest common denominator, and it is clear, even from the company’s own press material, that they have few aspirations but to sexualize the experience of playing games in groups. By offering a “dirty” or “flirty” experience — terms quoted directly from the company’s March 23 press release — GameCrush makes it clear that the PlayDates are there as little more than a virtual escort service.
Now, I am not sure if I would have chosen PlayDates as the label for the presumably busty women waiting to be objectified by hopeless gamers shelling out $6 to $10 for a 10-minute window of desperate come-ons and fruitless attempts at real conversation — the term seems more like something an infant’s mother would arrange for her nascent offspring. However, the company seems to have settled upon that terminology. No doubt it was chosen in part because of its slightly demeaning connotation. In addition, the label for the paying participants — Player — is an interesting throwback to those of us who remember the usage of the word “player” as a complimentary term for a male who earned the affection of many females. “Player” does, admittedly, have a neutral connotation in the context of video games, but this hierarchy adds an interesting connotation to the site as a sort of meat market where the Players select their PlayDates and then pay them for their services.
Were the site not so obviously sexist — all of the example PlayDates are attractive women and seem to be losing in all of the screenshots — it might be a little more tolerable. It seems like the service, which claims to be “designed to appeal to male and female gamers alike,” has neglected the latter group of its supposed market share, unless we assume that the only females who play video games are lesbians. Perhaps the service should be oriented toward matching gamers with other gamers of commensurate skill levels or choosing PlayDates who seem less like models and more like real people.

As students, we’ve been told time and time again that sometime during our four (or four-plus) years at Carnegie Mellon, we should have an internship that relates to our field of study. We often take what we can get for this internship, and we don’t necessarily have the option of being picky about where it’s located or how much it will pay, if it even pays at all.
However, as a recent article in The New York Times pointed out, many of those unpaid internships that students are vying for may actually be illegal. The article states that the U.S. Department of Labor will begin to more strictly enforce the criteria that allow an unpaid internship to be legal. According to a Guidance Letter issued by the Labor Department on Jan. 29, there are six official factors that determine whether an intern for a for-profit institution may be unpaid: The training is similar to what would be given at a vocational school or academic institution, the training is intended to benefit the intern, the interns do not take the place of paid employees, the employer does not immediately gain an advantage from the intern, the interns are not guaranteed a job at the end of their training period, and both the employer and interns understand that the trainees will not be paid.
The above criteria offer fairly stringent and rather unrealistic guidelines governing the line between paid and unpaid internships. It is difficult to come up with a scenario where the employer doesn’t benefit at all from having an intern work for them. We understand that the rules are in place to protect those who cannot afford to take an unpaid position, but in many cases these unpaid internships actually act as “foot-in-the-door” opportunities that help to establish and jump-start an intern’s career in a given field.
Although the guidelines governing unpaid internships are intended to protect potential employees, they could actually keep interns who are qualified and willing to work for free from getting a job in a field that simply is not financially capable of paying each and every one of its employees, such as journalism or theater. The criteria should be revamped to more realistically reflect today’s job market. They should be clarified to make it easy for students and employers to know if an unpaid internship is legal, and this should be done in a way that benefits both interns and their employers.
