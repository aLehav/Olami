Men’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team faced sixth-ranked Washington University on the road Friday night in St. Louis, Missouri. The Tartans fell 93–80 to the Bears and are now 10–9 overall and 4–4 in the University Athletic Association (UAA).
Senior Jack Serbin hit the game’s opening bucket with a jumper off the glass and the Tartans later held an 11–10 lead after a fastbreak layup by junior Ryan Maha with 14:08 showing on the clock. Four minutes later, the Tartans trailed 17–16 after a driving layup by first-year Colin McNeil.
The Bears then scored seven straight and after two free throws by McNeil, watched as a three-pointer went through the net at the shot clock buzzer to push their lead to 26–18.
The lead grew to 16 points by the end of the half with the Bears scoring the final five points following a pair of free throws by senior James Ormond.
The Tartans shot 40.7 percent from the field but surrendered 65.4 percent to the Bears on the defensive end for the half.
McNeil led the Tartans with 10 points at the break as Serbin and senior Chris Shkil were each saddled with foul trouble and held to four points apiece.
An 8–2 run for the Tartans to start the second half cut the deficit to 10 points after a three-pointer by Maha from the top of the key.
The Tartans pulled to within six points three times with half the period still to play but the Bears methodically ran their lead back to 13 on two shots from the foul line with 6:12 left to go.
A jumper by Serbin with one minute to play saw the Tartans trail 87–80 but four free throws sandwiched a layup and the Bears went on for the 93–80 home victory.
Serbin led five players in double figures with 18 points while Maha dropped in 15 points. Shkil followed with 13 points, as McNeil finished with 12 and first-year Zach Howarth scored 11. Serbin and Shkil each pulled down eight rebounds.
The Bears were led by Andrew Sanders who finished with 26 points and 10 rebounds. Kevin Kucera recorded a double–double with 10 points and 10 assists while Matt Highsmith contributed 18 points off the bench.
The Tartans will next face Brandeis University at home on Friday, Feb. 10.
Women’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team traveled to St. Louis, Missouri, to face the Washington University Bears on Friday, Feb. 3. The Bears, ranked ninth in the nation by D3hoops.com, defended their home court with a 79–69 victory over the 20th-ranked Tartans. The Tartans are now 15–4 overall and 4–4 in the UAA.
Senior Lisa Murphy led the Tartans with her 14th double–double of the season with 21 points and 12 rebounds. First-year Makayla Filiere scored 15 points for the Tartans while senior Jackie Hudepohl rebounded from a scoreless first half to tally 12 points for the game.
The Tartans trailed 22–19 at the end of the first period, as Murphy led with nine points. The Bears hit five shots from behind the arc and grabbed twice as many rebounds, including six on the offensive end to record seven second–chance points.
The Bears opened the second quarter with a three–pointer, and built a 30–19 lead before Murphy converted a layup off a feed to the post by Hudepohl with 6:47 showing on the clock.
Another 2:42 ticked off the clock before the Tartans scored again on a put–back layup by first-year Laurel Pereira. The Bears built an 18-point lead up until that basket and went on to lead 45–27 at the break.
The Tartans, who shot 53.8 percent in the first quarter, dropped to 35.7 percent for the half, while the Bears connected on 46.3 percent of their attempts.
Four three-pointers by the Tartans in the third quarter helped the visitors cut the deficit to 10 points but a four-point run to close the quarter gave the Bears a 59–45 advantage.
Back-to-back three-pointers by Filiere brought the Tartans back within 10 points, 73–63, with 3:36 to play. Following a Bear turnover, Hudepohl drained a baseline jumper to make the deficit eight but the Bears responded with two buckets inside and went on for the 79–69 win.
The Tartans will next play Brandeis University on Friday, Feb. 10.

Here we are with the final recap of the Tartan II’s first season of fantasy football. Previously, Editor-in-Chief India Price’s Plaidie Daddies upset Zeke Rosenberg’s heavily favored DeMarco DePolo to make it to the fantasy championships while my Dreamland Warriors came back from behind to squeak past Publisher Jade Crockem’s Mr. Rodgers’ Neighborhood.
In the end, the Plaidie Daddies defeated my Dreamland Warriors 202–200 to become our league champions. After all, how could a team with a name like that not win?
Plaidie Daddies over Dreamland Warriors 202-200
I remember way back in Week 4 when Price told me that she just planned on letting the roster she drafted just go at it without making any changes, despite having a kicker who didn’t play and a defense that frequently scored negative points. I encouraged her to make changes since growth is essential in fantasy football. I lost that week 107–104, a precursor to Price’s championship run.
Though I had built up a 117–98 lead in Week 16 thanks to New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees, Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy, and New York Giants wide receiver Beckham, it just wasn’t enough. Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor, Atlanta Falcons kicker Matt Bryant, and New England Patriots running back LeGarrette Blount kept her team afloat and within a realistic chance of making a comeback.
My team collapsed in Week 17 courtesy of an injury to McCoy, a deflated Oakland team that left Oakland Raiders running back Murray no room to run, and my impatience with Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Fitzgerald, who scored 15 points when I put in Bears wide receiver Alshon Jeffery and got two on the board instead. Brees and New York Jets running back Bilal Powell were the only two players on my team who scored double digits, compared to four players on Price’s team.
While Brees’ last drive against the Falcons gave me a 10-point lead heading into the final game between the Packers and Lions, three late passes to Detroit tight end Eric Ebron sealed the victory for the Plaidie Daddies.
Congratulations to Price. And f*** you, Zach Ertz. You do nothing for me before I cut you and pick up Tennesee Titans tight end Delanie Walker, and now you score 38 points against me. Ugh.
Mr. Rodgers’ Neighborhood over DeMarco DePolo 248-244
In a third-place match that could have easily been the final, Crockem’s team managed to overcome Rosenberg in a matchup that was close from start to finish. In Week 16, Rosenberg’s DeMarco DePolo escaped with a slim 127–124 lead. His wide receivers were critical to his success as Green Bay Packers wide receiver Jordy Nelson scored 36 points, Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown earned 25, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans totaled 22. The lone miscue Rosenberg made was his decision to start the Bills defense, a move which made him four points worse off than not having any defense at all.
For Crockem, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliot helped keep her team within striking distance of DeMarco DePolo, essentially setting up Week 17 as a winner take all matchup.
The Bills defense that scored -4 points in Week 16 came back to haunt Rosenberg in Week 17. Crockem emerged victorious after tallying 124 points compared to Rosenberg’s 117.
The three players in Mr. Rodgers’ Neighborhood who scored three points or fewer were more than balanced out by standout performances from Rodgers, Saints wide receiver Michael Thomas, and Packers wide receiver Devante Adams.
While Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman and Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan kept Rosenberg in contention, the goose egg from the Bills defense could not make up for the negative output the previous week, which turned out to be the difference in this extremely tight matchup.
What is going on? over Loquacious Losers 188-173
In a league and game where Pillbox Co-Editor Sinead Foley has no idea what is going on, she still managed to finish in fifth place after overcoming a 100–90 deficit against Layout Manager Abhishek Tayal’s Loquacious Losers.
Without much to play for, both teams settled for the players they had set previously, resulting in three zero point performances across the teams. Still, Tayal looked like he might have had the edge considering the performances of Steelers running back Le’Veon Bell, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith, and Giants wide receiver Sterling Shepard. However, Cardinals running back David Johnson and San Diego Chargers tight end Antonio Gates kept Foley’s team afloat heading into the last week of play.
Not switching up the roster ended up proving to be more costly for Tayal than Foley, as he had three players put up zero points compared to only Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill on Foley’s team.
The high scoring players Tayal had were on teams that wanted to rest their stars for the playoffs, resulting in a 98–73 score that put Foley in the final spot of the top half of the league.
extremely trash team over Masshole Knickerbockers 226-183
Despite its name, Alex Wood’s extremely trash team wasn’t actually that bad, just not given enough home run hitters from the waiver wire to keep its strong post draft status. Despite the losses the team had this year, Wood clearly dominated Lula Beresford’s rookie team.
In Week 16, the extremely trash team outscored Beresford’s team 145–67. Wood received great performances from Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant, and Saints running back Mark Ingram while Beresford started two injured players who totaled zero points.
Without any outstanding performances to keep her team afloat, she found herself in a 78-point hole.
Despite a sizable reversal of fortune that gave Beresford 116 points in Week 17 compared to Wood’s 81, it wasn’t nearly enough to overcome the previous week’s deficit.
Wood’s team had several players resting for the actual playoffs while Beresford called on Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, Steelers running back DeAngelo Williams, and Minnesota Vikings tight end Kyle Rudolph.
Finishing in eighth place is certainly not fun, but that’s to be expected from a first time player with less knowledge of the game than the competition (not everyone can be India and Jade). Finishing in seventh place despite a deep knowledge of football, however, must be frustrating for Wood, who will hopefully have better luck the next time he takes part in fantasy.
McManus’s Anus over How does this work? 225-152
This was a statement game for Sarah Gutekunst, one to prove that her team was not so bad that it would fall below Foley’s second, less observed team. McManus’s Anus won in convincing fashion, starting with a 115–75 result in Week 16. Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson led the team with 33 points, and three other players on her roster scored double digits. By contrast, Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota left his game injured, and the Denver Broncos defense yielded -4 points.
The final week of play closely resembled Week 16: Gutekunst scored 110 points compared to Foley’s 77.
Carolina Panthers wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin, Cleveland Browns wide receiver Terrelle Pryor, Browns tight end Gary Barnidge, and the Philadelphia Eagles defense gave good performances, while three players gave Foley zero points.
Strangely, Broncos kicker Brandon McManus sat on the bench during this matchup, despite being the inspiration for the team name and being Gutekunst’s favorite player last year. Evidently, she’s chosen to move on from him, which makes sense given her team’s close to dead last finish.
If you ever decide to play fantasy again Sarah, I definitely wish you better luck than you had this year. At least you’ve got The Bachelor.

“Whatever work I put in, I get out directly.”
This is how junior mathematical sciences major Mary St. John describes why she has stuck with swimming since she was first drawn to the sport at age three. It defines her involvement in the Carnegie Mellon Swimming and Diving team, putting her utmost effort into preparation for her races and cheering on her teammates when the matches are over. It equally applies to her efforts in the classroom, preparing for a career she believes will help make a considerable impact.
St. John readily admits that she’s the type of person who has always been in the world of sports, owing this to the influence of her brother and her father. Always looking up to her brother, she took up swimming and was immediately drawn to the fact that she was in full control of how far she could go in a mostly individual sport with a team aspect. While St. John took up other sports including field hockey, soccer, and diving, she ultimately chose to stick with swimming. “I’m definitely a stronger swimmer,” she said when asked if she had considered diving at Carnegie Mellon. “It was a stretch to think about doing both. Besides, practices conflict, so I understand why I couldn’t.”
When asked about why she was drawn to Carnegie Mellon, St. John emphasized the desire for balance in her life. “I wanted a school that was in a city so there would be other things to do outside of campus. Pittsburgh was a good balance, and Carnegie Mellon had a good balance between strong academics and a swim program I wanted.” She also mentioned her interest in the School of Drama, saying she was “excited to see what shows they could put on.”
It’s also extremely clear that her passion and determination has driven her in day-to-day life. “We have 5:30 practice. I pack food for before and after. Snacks are key. They get me through practice and academics.” Her daily routine lays the foundation for her performances at meets, and the results show. In the 2015–16 season, St. John finished first on the team in the 200-yard butterfly, 200-yard Individual Medley, and 400-yard IM, making the All-University Athletic Association (UAA) third team for the butterfly.
Her proudest accomplishment with the sport comes from her performance in the 2016 UAA Championships. Though she did not perform to her expectations on the first two days, she persevered and ended up finishing in first for the 200-yard butterfly. “I think it was really important to finish strong.”
Thinking about the future, St. John mentioned wanting to go into data science and specifically for the government. “My grandfather was an aeronautical engineer for NASA, which seemed cool to me even though I didn’t want to be an engineer. I want to make a big impact with statistical analysis, not just make people money.”
For now, St. John is focused on the upcoming UAA Championships. “I hope to swim really fast and get invited to nationals.”
St. John will next swim with the Tartan women at the UAA Championships from Wednesday, Feb. 8 to Saturday, Feb. 11.

After placing fourth in the national Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) Oracle Cup last fall as the first first-year from Carnegie Mellon to play in the tournament, Mike Rozenvasser is gearing up for the second half of his impressive rookie season.
From Haworth, N.J., Rozenvasser’s tennis career began at a young age, when his grandfather put a racket in his hand and taught him how to play. He also followed his brother’s footsteps and played soccer up until his first year of high school, when he had to choose between tennis and soccer.
“You don’t depend on your team – it’s an individual sport,” he said about why he chose tennis over soccer. “When you win, it’s the best feeling because you did it all by yourself, but when you lose, you did it all by yourself too. It’s all based on yourself and depends on how hard you want to work to succeed.”
Playing tennis at a collegiate level was never in question. “Giving it up in college would not even be plausible,” he said. Carnegie Mellon is the perfect fit for him. The coaches were very inviting during his visit to campus, and the players all said, “This place is awesome.” He could have played at a Division I school, but there, tennis is first and then academics. “Academics are more important [to me] than sports.”
In Rozenvasser’s first year at Carnegie Mellon it has been challenging to balance academics and tennis. “It’s a lot harder than high school,” he said, emphasizing the importance of time management. He is an Economics major, with both his parents and his brother in the finance field. While he isn’t positive on what career track he wants to pursue, he plans on working in the business industry. 
But tennis is still what he’s concentrating on. He plans to “keep on playing for four years,” but hasn’t thought about continuing out of college.
Though he intends on playing in some tournaments over the summer for fun, he wants to focus on things other than tennis after he graduates. “I’ll keep on playing, but nothing too serious.”
Off the court, Rozenvasser likes to go to the gym. “I like being physically active. If you’re physically healthy, you can be healthy in other aspects of your life,” he said. However, his mental toughness comes first when he’s playing tennis. “Mental and physical, they go hand in hand,” he said. “The more I’m in physical shape, the more confident I am.” But when he’s on the court, he’s always in his head. “I’m always yelling ‘Come on! Come on!’ I can be down Love-40, and it keeps me motivated and pumped up. There’s always a way to win.”
Though he prefers playing singles, doubles has grown on him at his time at Carnegie Mellon. “I’ve started playing with Kenny Zheng, a senior, a big mentor. Winning together is super fun, and the energy goes up through the roof.”
Though his ultimate goal is to win an NCAA Championship with the team and individually, Rozenvasser is excited for the indoor season moving forward. Though the men’s tennis team didn’t start off the way they wanted, he feels they can come back, and that they have the talent and the strong work ethic to succeed. 
The Tartans will continue their season this Saturday, Feb. 11, against Walsh University and St. Francis University.

EncompassCMU is finally here. For some, it’s the first of many job fairs in their college career, and for others, it’s their fourth or fifth job fair this semester alone. This is the time for you to get your foot in the door and get your résumé into the hands of an actual person instead of just blindly submitting it on Handshake. EncompassCMU may be where your work begins, but your job is far from over if you hope to land an internship from any of the companies present.
Follow Up Interviews
Some of you may end up leaving EncompassCMU with an interview from a company you spoke to. It is important that you find out as much information as possible about a company before interviewing with them. You may have gotten away with only knowing the name of the company and what their main business is at the job fair, but that is not enough information for you to make a lasting impression at an interview. Companies want to see that you’re interested and knowledgeable about their company. Take a little extra time to do a bit more research about the specific department you would like to work in at their company. If something about how the company operates is unclear to you, take note of it and at the end of the interview when the interviewer asks “do you have any questions,” you’ll be prepared.
Make sure to also ask about the company culture and views to ensure that this is the company for you. You don’t want to end up spending an entire summer at a company that has an environment that doesn’t fit you well. Internships are important in figuring out what you want to spend your years after Carnegie Mellon doing, and interviews are an integral part of that step.
Contact Recruiters
If someone gives you a business card, make sure to send them a follow up email to discuss job opportunities. Recruiters receive a lot of résumés at job fairs, but by contacting someone after the initial meeting, you can ensure that your name will stand out and your résumé will end up in the right hands. 
Career fairs are all about giving your résumé the personality that you can’t always put on paper, and making the effort to contact a recruiter after meeting them shows them that you are persistent and passionate about their company.
Some recruiters will tell you to also apply online after you speak to them at EncompassCMU. This can increase your chances of your résumé being seen and now they’ll be able to match your name and face. If a recruiter is telling you this, it is because they want to make sure that your résumé ends up in their database, so make sure that you do so before the end of the day.
Make a Spreadsheet
Applying, interviewing, and speaking to companies at job fairs can get exhausting. It’s hard to keep track of who you have and haven’t talked to before. Try keeping a spreadsheet of all the companies you’ve been in contact with. 
Make sure to update your spreadsheet after job fairs to reflect who you’ve met and interviewed with. 
This can also help keep you on track for who to reach out to with follow-up questions if you keep the company’s contact information in the spreadsheet as well.  Keep detailed notes of what the job would entail in your spreadsheet so that you know which companies to contact based on your interests.
Don’t Give Up
For some people, all it takes is one job fair or one interview to find a job, but for most others, it could take 10 job fairs, 20 interviews and almost 100 online applications. Everyone’s job search process is not the same. You could end up applying to almost 50 companies before you even get the chance to do an interview. Don’t feel discouraged if EncompassCMU leaves you empty-handed. It takes more than just one job fair to make or break your future career. Persistence is key! So make sure to get out there and give EncompassCMU your all.
For additional help in preparing for EncompassCMU visit the Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC) Monday through Friday from 11:30 a.m. – 1:30 p.m. or head to CPDC’s résumé blitz on Monday, Feb. 6 from 10 a.m. – 5 p.m.

If you walk into the Cohon Center Tuesday and Wednesday while taking the warmer route to class, you may feel out of place amongst an exceptionally well-dressed crowd, the likes of which are rarely seen on campus outside of the Tepper School of Business. It’s that time of year again: various companies are here this week for EncompassCMU, the semester’s largest career fair. 
The fair will take place in the Wiegand Gymnasium from 10 a.m.–12:45 p.m. for internship opportunities and 2 p.m.–5:45 p.m for full-time positions, although students are welcome to attend either session if they have class conflicts. If you’re a first-year or sophomore, chances are that you’re not going. Perhaps you intended to go, but are now having second thoughts given the number of jobs that go to upperclass students. On the other hand, you may be going, but mainly for the swag — free stuff, for the uninitiated. Here are some better reasons to go to EncompassCMU as an underclassman.
Nothing to lose
Take a moment to sit back and think about your dream job. I bet there will be at least one company at EncompassCMU where you can get that job, or do something related that’s equally exciting. 
This semester’s EncompassCMU is one of the few events at which you’ll have absolutely nothing to lose by talking to recruiters. Your passion may even impress them enough to land you that dream summer job! You’ll never know if you don’t take the plunge.
Prep for future fairs
If you’re firmly convinced that there’s no way that the company of your choice will hire a freshman or sophomore, here’s a more practical reason to go to EncompassCMU. Going to EncompassCMU this year is good preparation for your following years at Carnegie Mellon. Attending this semester will allow you to feel what it’s like, so that you know what to expect as an upperclass student. Simply walk up to the company that you’re eyeing for a job in the future, and chat with the recruiter. Ask about the company’s required qualifications and interview process, so that you know what they’re looking for and can be better prepared for the following year, when you’re in the running for a job.
Small booths are hiring
While you’re at it, check out some of the smaller booths that none of the upperclassmen are going to. Chatting with the recruiters there is less stressful — sometimes even fun — and can definitely boost your confidence. And remember, they’re hiring too. So if they offer any opportunities you’re interested in, go for it! The odds of getting that job are substantially higher and the company probably pays more than traditional summer employers. So, hunt out your nicest formal clothes and be prepared to join the crowd of well-dressed students. Draft a quick résumé — or update an already existing one — and print out a few copies. Make a name tag, dress nicely, and get ready to go.

University career fairs can sometimes seem like madhouses, with hundreds of employers visiting each day and an even greater number of students passing through. Nevertheless, it’s important to remain collected and professional when presenting yourself to the people who will hopefully soon be hiring you for a full-time position or summer internship. Here are five things you should be sure to bring to EncompassCMU to make sure you strike the perfect first impression.
The right attire
Looking like you know what you’re doing is half the battle at a career fair. To make your attire reflect the confidence employers want to see in candidates, stick to a formal dress code. For men, wear a business suit with a solid shirt or one that has a clean pattern. Tuck in your shirt, and wear a belt even if you don’t need one. Don’t forget a tie and a pair of black or brown shoes to finish off your look. 
For women, wear a suit or a skirt with a suit jacket. Pair neutral colors with black or gray, and wear flats or professional heels to complement the outfit. Both men and women should take the time to iron out wrinkles in your pants and shirt and to brush off any smudges that may be lingering on your jacket. As for hygiene, make sure your hair is cleaned up — cut and combed — and you look as if you got more than your fair share of sleep the night before, even if you haven’t.
Lists of companies to visit
Before attending the fair, visit the Career and Professional Development Center’s career fair webpages to view the companies coming to campus. 
Research companies that interest you and make a list of the ones that seem to be good fits. 
For the companies you’re head over heels for, consider spicing up your résumé and making unique copies, rather than a general résumé, to focus on the qualities you know those companies are looking for. Hand your general résumé out to the companies you’re less interested in, but would still be happy to work for. By researching companies beforehand, you’re sure to make a better impression with recruiters. Knowing a company’s work and how you can specifically help the company will definitely make you stand out from the rest of the pack.
A portfolio for résumés
Have a handful of résumés, but don’t know what to do with them? Take a trip to the University Bookstore to pick up a portfolio. These firm folders for your papers will round out your professional look. Not only do they look sleek, but they also ensure that you won’t suffer any résumé snafus, like dropping all your papers or accidentally handing a recruiter a unique résumé intended for another company.
Portfolios are easy to tuck under your arm and walk with, and they also add to your air of professionalism while giving you something to do with your hands. These handy folders allow you to organize your résumés, and a list of references and samples of your work if your field typically requires those elements.
A water bottle and food
Career fairs can become packed and hectic. To give yourself some relief in your multiple layers of clothing, bring a water bottle. Take a drink of cool water if you’re feeling hot or overwhelmed. Staying hydrated will ensure that you are focused before you visit the companies that potentially hold your dream jobs. Before the fair, also make sure to eat. Sometimes, you may find yourself waiting in unexpectedly long lines, which could cut into time allotted for lunch after the fair. Even if the fair isn’t crowded, it’s always better to be over-rather than underprepared.
The right attitude
Remember that you’re at the career fair to land a job or internship. Act that way. Approach all recruiters as if you want nothing more than to work for their company. Greet them enthusiastically and shake their hand firmly. Show them what qualifies you for a position at their company through an already prepared speech, but be sure to be flexible in what you’ve prepared if the recruiter has other plans for your conversation. Be ready to answer some tough questions, and don’t break a sweat if you’re not able to adequately answer one. Answer it to the best of your ability and get ready for the next question.  Ask the recruiter some questions to show your interest and ensure that a position at the business is something you want to pursue. Thank the recruiter at the end of your conversation and follow up with an email after.

Carnegie Mellon is establising itself in the tech startup world. With futuristic research occurring in all of its departments, the university presents its students with virtually unlimited resources to create the country’s most innovative technological companies. Concurrently, the city of Pittsburgh is morphing into an innovation and tech hub, ripe for new business. Thus, it is unsurprising that Rough Draft Ventures, General Catalyst’s student-led program that backs founders at the university level, has taken notice of the area’s promise and turned its attention to Carnegie Mellon and its startups.
Rough Draft was founded in 2013 by then-senior at Harvard University Peter Boyce II, who aimed to bridge the gap between funding and college startups. The program was a welcome twist to the business. It relates to and understands its college-level entrepreneurs effortlessly, because the program itself is student-led. A team of students comprised of individuals from a variety of backgrounds and schools meets once a week to hear student founder pitches and to make recommendations for backing highest potential companies.
Moreover, it views its youthful team, not as a limitation, but as an asset. On its website, the venture proudly describes itself as “the next generation of founders” and “a student team, building and empowering the largest network of student founders” across universities. Business Insider’s Julie Bort labelled it “a new kind of VC,” acknowledging the novelty of the young and vibrant student-led firm.
Rough Draft has rapidly made a name for itself by backing companies such as developer tool company AppHub out of MIT, and travel company Freebird out of  Harvard Business School, creating almost 600 jobs in a matter of years. With an established presence at other prestigious schools, Rough Draft’s next stop is, understandably, Carnegie Mellon.
Leading the program’s move to Pittsburgh is Carnegie Mellon junior Akshay Goradia, an information systems and human-computer interaction major who joined the Rough Draft team in 2016. Before becoming a member of the student team, Goradia pitched the move to Carnegie Mellon’s budding startup field. “Pittsburgh has a rich density of entrepreneurship and Carnegie Mellon has a uniquely strong entrepreneurial ecosystem, so I made that proposal,” said Goradia in an exclusive interview with The Tartan.
Indeed, Goradia correctly describes Carnegie Mellon as a melting pot of technology and startups, so much so that Rough Draft has already backed their first CMU company. 101 Edu, Inc. is an educational platform founded by chemical engineering Ph.D. student Justin Weinberg. Already in use at six east coast and midwestern universities, 101 Edu is “reimagining the college STEM [science, technology, engineering and math] classroom with active learning,” as is stated on its homepage. Also displayed on its website are instructors and students alike beaming about the practicality the app has introduced into their chemistry courses. Nothing more could epitomize Rough Draft’s ethos, which is to “provide value to many more people than just the ones that we invest in,” as stated by Goradia.
Early capital can be helpful for young companies that are testing their product and looking to take it to the next level. Beyond capital, Rough Draft’s ability to connect with fellow student founders, as well as gain support from mentors, proves immeasurably helpful for early success. 
Boyce is joined by Natalie Bartlett and Denali Tietjen who work with the student-led ventures to provide access to resources such as service providers, mentorship around launching a product or fundraising, as well as connecting the teams to mentors with expertise.    
VCs are a pivotal difference between success and failure. They are the metaphorical nudge young businesses need to stand on their feet, and that is why Rough Draft’s arrival at Carnegie Mellon only means lucrative growth for the startups going forward.

The relationship between sustainable urbanization, energy and water runs deep, and one cannot be discussed without invoking the others. A sustainable city is one that considers its intake of resources and expulsion of waste with respect to the environment; a smart city is one that uses technology to achieve this description. At the forefront of energy and sustainability research is the Wilton E. Scott Institute of Energy at Carnegie Mellon, which will be hosting an event on Feb. 16 called Building a Smart and Resilient City: The Energy-Water Nexus. A part of a larger program called Resilient Pittsburgh, this event aims to highlight the interconnection between energy and water.
The keynote speaker is the deputy director of the Energy Institute and professor at the University of Texas, Dr. Michael Webber. Webber has been instrumental in promoting the energy-water discussion. His book “Thirst for Power: Energy, Water, and Human Survival” highlights the intimate relationship between those two resources. Webber will speak for about half an hour. The event includes six other panelists whose roles range from mayor to CEO.
Anna Siefken, the Scott Institute associate director for innovation and strategic partnerships, is central to the planning for this event. Siefken stressed the synergy between energy and many other aspects of a sustainable city: “Energy and infrastructure, energy and transportation; they are all interconnected things, but the energy that powers them is an important aspect.” She also emphasized that the Scott Institute’s role “is to be a voice and connect people with information.” 
This event does just that, providing the Carnegie Mellon community with access to the great minds at the forefront of urban planning, energy production and water conservation.
This event also gears students towards thinking about energy’s role in their future fields of work. Siefken wants “students  who leave to know that there’s a role for them and that sustainability, in any position they have, can have an impact.” Carnegie Mellon complements its rounded education with events like this.
The Scott Institute, and Carnegie Mellon as a whole, has supported Pittsburgh’s drive for sustainability. “There is a partnership between the university community and the city of Pittsburgh,” says Siefken. In fact, Carnegie Mellon’s efforts to transform Pittsburgh into a smart city have already began to take effect, and can be seen in projects like Metro21 and Traffic21.
Pittsburgh may serve as an example of the promise American cities have to transform their energy and water demands for a safer environment. Tracey Greenstein of Fobres describes Pittsburgh as “a hub for sustainable design, green technology” and “a shining example for how the rest of the country should operate.” By uniting several leaders in the field of energy, this event initializes that process.
Organizers of the Energy-Water Nexus event expect to accommodate about 400 guests for an hour and a half. Half the spaces are already gone, so all those interested should quickly register on its  Eventbrite page. It is an ample opportunity for students to understand the future roles of energy and water.

The source of energy once promised to the rid the earth of air-borne pollutants — while providing cheap fuel for an indefinite period of time — lost support from both the public and private spheres. Is our current skepticism toward nuclear fission justified? Or are we ignoring what may be the solution to the global energy crisis?
A nuclear energy renaissance was not long ago, as in the early 2010s support for nuclear power had expanded across the world. However, in the wake of Fukushima, plans to construct nuclear power plants were abandoned in almost every country. Earthquakes such as the one which caused the 2011 Japanese tsunami are a fact of life, and it may not be possible to construct an entirely quake-proof power plant.
Yet, the damage to Fukushima in 2011 occurred mostly because of a tsunami, not an earthquake. Furthermore, certain areas of the world experience significantly less seismic activity than others. For example, building nuclear reactors in the east coast of the United States is, on the whole, safe from these types of geological events. Nonetheless, the rapid increase in hydraulic fracturing may be triggering earthquakes in previously geologically placid areas.
Even given the rare — yet potentially catastrophic — risks of fission reactors, nuclear power may be significantly safer than fossil fuels in the long run. So, why does the public have so much fear towards an economically and environmentally viable fuel? Part of the reason could be miscommunication between scientists and the public. Nuclear power has been represented as a dangerous fuel for decades, and the media has fomented resentment towards the energy source in society. Perhaps scientists who support nuclear power need to communicate with the public directly, and to explain that nuclear plants are not as dangerous as the public opinion implies.
Carbon-free and cheap nuclear fission without accidents still presents a currently unsolved dilemma: the storing of nuclear waste. As of now, we currently enclose nuclear waste in materials that will hold them for potentially thousands of years, and bury these materials deep within the earth. Do we trust these methods for protecting us from the nuclear waste? Is the consequence for these casings cracking — thereby leaking the waste into groundwater — too dire to justify the risks? We do not have any economical clean alternatives at this moment. Perhaps storing nuclear waste is a small price to pay for a clean atmosphere.
While our nation is not currently pushing the construction of new reactors, nuclear research has experienced its own renaissance in recent years. New types of reactors are under development, some of which may alleviate the drawbacks of contemporary nuclear plants. For example, pebble bed and traveling wave reactors may ameliorate safety concerns surrounding 20th century reactor designs.
And then there are Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). While nuclear power provides cheap energy over a long period of time — due to the high energy density of the fuel — the startup cost of building a full sized plant is too high for most companies to shell out. SMRs are smaller reactors that can be built for a significantly smaller up-front cost than traditional nuclear power plants. While still in development, these reactors could be implemented across the country for a relatively low construction cost, each providing cheap energy to neighborhoods rather than cities. But such technology raises another concern: do we truly wish to have a small nuclear reactor as a neighbor?
Nuclear power remains a very difficult subject. The general disregard of nuclear power as a dangerous and infeasible source of power seems to be misguided, and nuclear energy — particularly with the advent of modern reactor designs — is a solution worth serious consideration. As scientists, we must communicate the true complexities of nuclear power to the populace so that we, the citizens, can rationally decide if it is time to make amends with the all-powerful atom.

Researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies have created human-pig hybrid embryos by inserting human stem cells into existing pig embryos. The human cells not only survived the implantation, but grew and began to develop into tissues in vivo — an important step toward growing human organs inside animals to provide much-needed transplants.
The researchers, led by Dr. Jun Wu, intended to discover whether human cells could survive in a gestating animal embryo. The human cells used for this experiment were induced pleuripotent stem cells — adult human cells that have been genetically altered to have the characteristics of embryonic stem cells. The stem cells were inserted into pig and cow embryos, all of which survived the insertion process. Next, the altered pig embryos were implanted into pigs and allowed to incubate. The human cells successfully incorporated themselves into the developing embryos with modestly low rejection rates, and had begun to develop into specialized tissues when the test was terminated at four weeks into gestation.
This is the latest in a series of experiments producing interspecies chimeras — organisms with DNA from more than one species. One well-known procedure in this field involves breeding mice that lack pancreases. Rat stem cells are then used to grow rat pancreases inside the mice. The Salk researchers recreated this experiment at the embryonic stage as a precursor to their pig experiment, using rat stem cells to grow pancreases, hearts, and eyes inside mouse embryos. The rat stem cells also contributed to the development of the mouse gallbladders — an interesting finding, as rats do not have gallbladders. The rat components did not appear to significantly impact the health or lifespan of the mice in the experiment, which is positive news for scientists hoping to explore the medical implications of this study.
Research on interspecies chimeras has great medical significance because it could lead to a reliable supply of transplantable human organs. 
Over 100,000 Americans are currently waiting to receive donated organs, a number that has increased dramatically over the past few decades as transplants have become safer and more reliable. Unfortunately, the number of organ donors has remained relatively unchanged. Growing human organs inside animals could alleviate the need for human donors — and if the incubated organs were grown from the stem cells of the intended recipient, it could significantly lower the risk of transplant rejection as well.
Studies on chimeras are fraught with ethical concerns. Though human-animal chimeras have been used for medical research for decades without issue, these earlier chimeras were created by inserting human cells late in the animal’s development, when most or all tissue functions have already been determined. When human cells are incorporated into an embryo, as in many recent studies, the researchers have considerably less control over what happens to those cells, or what they develop into. 
Ethicists are concerned that human genes may end up in the animal’s brain cells or gametes, leading to heightened sentience and intelligence, or the possibility of producing offspring. Considerations like these raise questions of animal rights and “violation of the order of nature,” according to medical ethicist Göran Hermerén.
Because of these ethical complications, the National Institute of Health (NIH) temporarily halted funding for human-animal chimera research in 2015. (The Salk Institute chimera research was privately funded.) Carrie Wolinetz, the NIH’s associate director for science policy, asserts that chimera research will be encouraged to continue when there is “an appropriate oversight system so we can make sure it is proceeding responsibly.” However, it is unclear what “ethical responsibility” means for this kind of research.
The Salk research did not violate any current ethical guidelines, but it will be necessary to reevaluate such guidelines in light of the enormous benefit this research could bring to patients in need.

With a simple turn of a handle, you have access to clean water. And, as residents of Pittsburgh have discovered in the past week, the cleanliness of water dramatically affects one’s quality of life.
Access to clean water is vital for the survival of individuals and communities. In July 2010, the United Nations General Assembly acknowledged the human right to water and sanitation through Resolution 64/292. In Nov. 2002, the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights adopted General Comment No. 15, in which Article I.1 states: “The human right to water is indispensable for leading a life in human dignity. It is a prerequisite for the realization of other human rights.” 
By some accounts, efforts to obtain clean drinking water date back even prior to the discovery of fire. Ancient people relied on taste to tell if water was clean, which is actually not a viable method. In one of the earliest documentations dating back to the 15th century, archaeologists found Sanskrit writings in ancient Egyptian tombs depicting water treatment. In the Sus’ruta Samhita, from 2000 BCE, there are a number of different water treatment methods described, including boiling and heating water, filtering through gravel and sand, and dipping hot iron into it. 
In terms of water distribution, the earliest account of piping dates back to 3000 BCE, with Mesopotamia’s baked clay pipes, China’s bamboo pipes and Egypt’s copper sheets that were hammered into cylinders, all of which were used to transport water. In 400 BCE, Rome’s aqueduct system carried water throughout the entire city.
Pittsburgh as a city was established a little more recently than Rome, in 1816. Before the public water supply began in 1802 with the digging of four 47-foot wells, residents relied on river water. As the population grew, it became necessary to expand the water distribution, and the city built several pumping stations that pumped water directly from the rivers with no purification. By the end of the 19th century, however, the river water had become too contaminated and scientists had found evidence that drinking impure water could negatively affect health through waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever.
Thus, by 1905, construction began on plants that implemented slow sand filtration (SSF). SSF is a technique in which contaminated freshwater (river water, in Pittsburgh’s case) flows into a reservoir and through a layer of sand, where it is both physically filtered and biologically treated to remove pathogens and sediments. 
The key difference between SSF and rapid sand filtration (RSF), apart from the speed at which the water is filtered, is the fact that SSF is primarily biological while RSP is primarily physical. In SSF, a microbial community known as the “schmutzdecke” is established on the top layer of sand, causing the top layer to be biologically active. These predatory bacteria, which generally come from the source water, feed on microbes from the water that pass through the SSF, which is particularly effective in removing bacteria, viruses and heavy metals, but is not effective in removing chemicals. 
In 1911, the city began using chlorine as an additional disinfectant. Chlorination of water is the most commonly used method of killing microorganisms in freshwater. 
According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, chlorine levels of up to four milligrams per liter are considered safe in drinking water. 
At this level, chlorine is effective against pathogenic bacteria, but not strong enough to kill all viruses, cysts and worms. However, combined with filtration, it is effective at disinfecting water supplies. 
By the second half of the 20th century, the SSF system had aged and an upgrade to the water purification system occurred in two stages. First, a clarifier pretreatment station was constructed in 1962 to chemically treat freshwater and remove iron, manganese, tastes, odors, and colors from the water before it reached filtration. Second, the SSF stations were replaced with RSF stations in 1969.
In 1984, the Pittsburgh Water and Sewage Authority (PWSA) was officially formed, taking charge of maintenance and construction of all water distribution systems in Pittsburgh. According to their website, PWSA’s vision is “to provide water and wastewater services that meet or exceed all regulations and customer expectations at the lowest possible cost.”
Last week, on Jan. 31, the Pittsburgh Water and Sewage Authority issued a precautionary flush and boil water advisory for residents of Pittsburgh. When testing near a Highland Park water filtration plant, some tests showed that the treated drinking water had levels of chlorine that were below regulation of the Pennsylvania Department of Environment (DEP); there was a risk that the treated drinking water still contained microorganisms. 
Later that day, the PWSA issued another statement saying they took the Highland Park plant out of service and added chlorine to the water to maintain DEP regulations.
On Feb. 2, the PWSA lifted the precautionary flush and boil water advisory, confirming that there was no longer a risk to the drinking water supply. Although the entire affair only took place over the course of a few days, it brings a sharp reminder that access to clean water is as much a privilege as it is a right.

Doomsday Clock moved minutes closer to midnight
The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists just moved the Doomsday Clock two minutes and 30 seconds to midnight. Reasons for the decision include increased nuclear  proliferation, climate change, a rise in nationalism worldwide, the randomness of the Trump administration and, to a lesser extent, regular disregard for scientific opinion and fact. This is the closest the clock has been to midnight since 1953, when the first hydrogen bombs were being tested.
The Doomsday Clock is a symbolic representation of mankind’s proximity to annihilation, with 12 a.m. being the apocalyptic hour. In 1945, scientists invented the clock after witnessing the immense devastation atomic bombs unleashed on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, seeing that humanity possessed the technology to destroy cities in a matter of seconds.

Snapchat files for $3 billion IPO, finally goes public
The latest social network to cause a frenzy, Snapchat, has just filed for an initial public offering (IPO) worth $3 billion. Perhaps the most expensive IPO ever, its value surpasses that of Facebook’s and Google’s at the times of their IPOs. This pricey IPO comes at no shock, as the founders of the media sharing juggernaut evaluate the app at $25 billion.
Snapchat and its unique take on how people share photos, filters, video, texts and their daily lives launched it to the top of the social media bubble. So much so that other apps, such as Instagram, copied the  successful formula.
An IPO is a company’s first sale of stock to the public, turning it from a private firm to a public one. Selling stock allows a company to generate stock by issuing dept or equity, and several tech companies eventual do so.

Trump’s Twitter found to be insecure by hackers
Donald Trump’s Twitter account, which he uses incessantly, is incredibly unprotected, especially since he is currently the President of the United States. He still uses a phone running an Android operating system. Donald Trump’s account has been hacked before, but that was before he became the leader of the free world. Should hackers gain access to his account, they could manipulate stock markets and foreign policy to their benefit, as Trump’s tweet usually do.
Although Twitter does not offer special protection for politicians, it does provide users with the option of two-factor authentication before access to their accounts is granted. Trump does not employ any of these measures. When attempting to login to the page, hackers even noted that the page is registered with a Gmail account.

The Milky Way is being pushed by unseen forces
The Milky Way is being pushed through the universe by an unseen force. Scientists published a paper last year detailing what is known as the dipole repeller effect and its effect on the motion of our home galaxy; this is a push-like phenomenon exerted by large expanses of emptiness in space. On the other end of the push is a pull from a large group of galaxies 75 million light-years away called the Shapely Attractor.
The researchers created a 3D map of the flow of galaxies in our region of space. They found that galaxies flow in gravitational streams like water running downhill, repelled by regions of empty space and attracted by areas with denser matter. This repeller force adds to the Milky Way’s velocity of about two million kilometers per hour, which was caused by the expansion of the universe.

Last year is hottest year on record for third time in a row
2016 is now the hottest year on record. This has happened consecutively for the last three years and 16 times since the beginning of the millennium. The Earth’s temperature has steadily increased throughout the 20th century, but warming accelerated in the 1980s.
The climate scientists that conducted this research concluded that about 75 percent of the increased global temperature is due to human activity. They surmised that such heating has less than one in a million chance of happening had human activity been taken out of the equation. Evidence of climate change has shown itself in several forms, including more frequent extreme weather and the reduction of arctic ice that occurs at a rate of 13.3 percent per decade. Scientists expect warmth records to be continually broken for the foreseeable future.

2020 Olympic medals to be made from old phones
For the 2020 Olympics, Japan will make medals with old phones. The public will be asked to donate their old phones in order to amass two tons of gold, silver and bronze for the 5,000 medals. The Olympic committee cited the limited amount of resources in Japan and on the planet as their reason for the idea; they also wish to create awareness about recycling.
Olympic medals are traditionally made from metal obtained from mines. Japan, however, does not have the luxury of having resource deposits below its territory. It will place boxes in local offices and telecoms around the country, where citizens can drop their unused electronics. Phones contain small amounts of the rare metals such as those needed for the medals, which will be obtained using refining and chemical separation methods.

Power and the Soul is the annual Frame gallery show focused on identity, intersectionality, and diversity, on view Jan. 27 - Feb. 16. This exhibit offers an important and illuminating look at some of the Carnegie Mellon School of Art’s most prolific artists, whose presented artworks reflect the current aura of the community’s sentiments towards the political climate and recent elections. Some of the works illustrate the artists’ personal experiences with the effect of politics infiltrating their lives, such as sophomore Aldy Lawantara’s "Childhood Memories of the Indonesian Genocide." Other works are direct polemics of current political controversies, such as junior Andrew Edwards’ "Help me be Heard," a screen print criticizing the Dakota Access Pipeline project.
The show included two discussion events, where curators Maya Kaisth, a senior art major, Kasem Kydd, a junior also majoring in art, and Daniel See Yongxin, a Bachelor of Humanities and Art sophomore, monitored the conversations and questions visitors had regarding the artists' creative practices, the development of their works, and the thought processes of combining personal and political elements. The discussion embodied a free-form structure, where the artists present could choose to talk about their work, visitors were invited to provide commentaries, and anyone could open up discussions about race and inequality. 
I had the pleasure of attending one of these discussions in the Frame. It started with the introduction of Kydd, who introduced his work "The First Black Men on the Moon." Originally a video for multi-monitors meant to imitate a triptych, a quintessential framework of art predominantly found in religious Renaissance and Gothic creations, "The First Black Men on the Moon" explores the historical context, and attempts to rewrite historical narratives of the past, present, and future. It’s a digital lineage of video-making, unbound to the traditions of what the craft originally means. Inside the three channel video monitors, Kydd plays multiple characters and how they interact on a lunar landscape, what the impacts are like for that particular event, how the black men interact in these spaces and what those interactions mean, and how culturally relevant they are now.
Calm and introspective, Kydd narrated the creative and interpretive choices that effectively symbolize his struggle with manhood, mental rigidity, and race. His focus tunneled towards certain spaces like sports. He uses his work as escapist spaces where he leaves the physical world and where he can pretend to be a basketball player, a dream he has always had as a child growing up with black basketball role models.
What I initially believed would become an emotionally charged discussion filled with tension turned out to be quiet and courteous, with many attendees lost in speechless contemplation. Artists seated around the circle shifted quietly, perhaps reflecting on the societal bounds they are trapped in, the possibilities they couldn’t achieve. One commentator stated how peculiar that the most popular genre young black men are recreated in are sports games as opposed to science fiction games, or fantasy games, so even still, the limit of imaginativeness is constrained. It seems that black men are trapped within the limits of choosing between being represented as a rapper or an athlete. Kydd nodded in agreement. 
This was the pace for the next hour and a half. Artists were seated in a circle patiently waiting their turn, humbly describing their pieces, followed by a moments of silence. Kaisth, poised on her bench seat, provided commentaries that would fill the pockets of silence, provoking the artists to elaborate on their personal experiences and artistic choices. When faced with a new description around the circle, her eyes would light up, attentive and observant. On one occasion, sophomore humanities and art major Chloe Desaulles described her data visualization piece, a submission-based feed that provided a platform for opinions to be protected in complete anonymity. Kaisth, impressed with its interactive qualities and shouldering the responsibility of sustaining the conversation, commented on the work quite like a critique. “It would be really interesting for you to have it in different geographical locations, because here... at [Carnegie Mellon], people seem to feel the same way even though there are a few outliers.”
The conversation became more lively when an artist expressed her conflict between being a maker and an activist. “It’s a hard balance of an issue and there is so much guilt associated with it,” she said, questioning the usefulness of her work and struggling with allocating her time to both her craft and student activism. Many agreed on the difficulty of fulfilling that dual role. Kydd, who had slowly become more outspoken during the session, remarked thoughtfully how necessary it is “to realize the importance of the work you’re making and the roles it can have in the future, to harness that power onto yourself. [I] think it’s super necessary to... realize you can be both simultaneously.” Everyone else nodded.
Excellently curated, Power and the Soul successfully chronicles the emotional turmoil many individuals experienced regarding the “pain we have seen, heard and felt within our communities, and America as a whole.” Interactive and inclusive, the show is a step forward in providing a necessary conversation about the human condition amidst a polarized era of inequality.

Oscar season is here and cinephiles across the globe are placing their bets on which movies will win. This year my money was riding on La La Land (because Hollywood loves movies about Hollywood), or Manchester by the Sea, because most movies that win have to be about some really sad story of hardship and struggle. But still, even after all my careful analysis my bet was as well thought out as that of a drunk gambler placing all his money on number 31 at the roulette table. Next year though, my bets will be on point, because last week I had the opportunity to visit the Sundance Film Festival. The Sundance Film Festival is the greatest predictor of Oscar buzz, not to mention the largest independent film festival in the United States. Here's the catch: Movies that come out at Sundance this year will be considered at the 2018 Oscars (I know it’s a little confusing). While Manchester by the Sea, premiered at Sundance last year, La La Land director Damien Chazelle’s previous movie Whiplash, which won 3 Oscars, premiered at Sundance 2014. Over the past 39 years, the festival has given us countless phenomenal movies and has provided a platform to launch the careers of many favorite directors such as Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson, The Coen Brothers, Christopher Nolan, and Quentin Tarantino —  who was present at the festival this year for the 25th anniversary screening of the Reservoir Dogs. 
I got the opportunity to attend this screening with a few friends and fellow students, including first-year art major Coco Allred, sophomore creative writing and drama major Brian Bizier, sophomore Dietrich student Danielle Geimer, senior statistics major Suvrath Penmetcha, and senior and President of the CMU Film Club, Max Harlynking. In Harlynking's words, “Getting to see Michael Madsen watch himself play Mr. Blonde in Reservoir Dogs 25 years later, with Quentin in the room, was just incredible. You don't forget something like that.” The experience was all-in-all, surreal and indicative of the amazing things you get the opportunity to witness at the Sundance Film Festival. When I narrated this story to Carnegie Mellon English Professor, Jeff Hinkelman, and the one stop for discussing all things film on campus, he prodded, “Yes, yes I get it, you saw Tarantino. But did you watch anything good?” Well yes, I did. 
I watched eleven feature films, the short program award winners, and had an incredible eye-opening Virtual Reality (VR) experience. The feature films screened were Axolotyl Overkill, Where is Kyra?, XX, Machines, Free and Easy, Nile Hilton Incident, Roxanne Roxanne, Golden Exits, The Incredible Jessica James, My Happy Family and Call Me By Your Name. 
Axolotyl Overkill is a German film about a teenager who deals with her mother’s death, and she begins an unsupervised escapade, such as falling in love with a much older woman. The story is about her journey to discover who she is and how she goes about living the rest of her life, all the while drinking, smoking, taking drugs, and partying with her crazy movie star friend. It is shot beautifully through the urban landscape of Berlin, and the changes in acts are depicted through surreal dance sequences. The film won the special jury award for cinematography. I would remember to google "Axolotyl" before you go see the film, it will make it more interesting. 
Machines was the only Indian film to premiere at the festival this year. It won the World Documentary Special Jury Award for Excellence in Cinematography. In it, director Rahul Jain takes us inside one of the textile mills in India. What starts as a depiction of the machinery and workings of the factory becomes a story of the plight of laborers and the apathy of the owners. 
One of the best movies I watched at the festival this year was definitely the Nile Hilton Incident. It won the Grand Jury Prize in the World Cinema Dramatic category. It is about a corrupt cop in Cairo at the start of the Arab spring, who is investigating the murder of a singer who was in a secret relationship with one of the most powerful businessmen in Cairo. This movie had everything I ever want from any movie: a true depiction of corruption and greed, placed in a historical setting, with just enough intrigue, romance, drama, and thrill. In my mind, it is the only contemporary movie to come close to being as good as Casablanca. 
Roxanne Roxanne was another amazing film, which follows the early life and struggles of hip-hop legend Roxanne Shante, who is played by none other than 2016 Carnegie Mellon University Drama graduate Chante Adams, who went on to win the Sundance Special Jury Award for Breakthrough Performance for her role in the film. 
Call Me by Your Name was the last movie that I watched at the festival and was one that honestly surprised me the most. The story is about a teenager falling in love with an older man visiting his father at his Italian summer home. It's just that, the parents are okay with it. There is no homophobia. It is just a story of two men (well a boy and a man) falling in love, and it is sexy, refreshing, and wonderful. 
The Short Program Award winners, on the other hand, were disappointing. The shorts were good, no doubt, but I didn’t quite enjoy them as much as some of the other things I saw at the festival. One short did, however, stand out. And so we put goldfish in the pool was the name of this film, which won the Short Film Grand Jury Prize. The film is a Japanese story about four ‘bored’ (you’ll hear that word a lot in the movie) girls in middle school who place 400 goldfish in their school’s swimming pool. If that doesn’t sound interesting enough, let me tell you that watching the film reminded me of the time I watched my first French New Wave film. It is the feeling that this is how movies should be shot. It feels amazing, it feels right, and at the same time it feels completely novel. 
The VR installations were something that I was, at first, a little skeptical about, but they blew my mind. "Life of Us" was one installation that particularly stood out. The way it works is you ‘play’ it with a partner — in my case, I played it with Suvrath — and you and your partner enter different rooms. In these rooms you wear a headset, put on headphones and they hand you controllers. You are then taken through human evolution, from protozoa to tadpole, dinosaurs, apes, humans and on to the next stage, robots. The experience was amazing. At each stage of the evolution, you become the creature, which means that if you look down and about you can see your body, and if you look around, you can see the world as it was at that time. I screamed throughout this experience. The worst part is that once you're done with the experience, they screen the version that you played so that everyone can see what you did and hear how much you screamed. It was definitely a very unique experience and heralds the great new technology that is coming in the future. 
Other than watching amazing things and freezing to near death (the festival is held in Park City, Utah in January), there are many other things that you can do at Sundance. For many in the industry it is one of the best networking events of the year. You will often see people exchanging business cards on the streets, in busses, during movies and at many of the networking events and parties. As a student, (or for anyone under 25), you can buy the Student Ignite Package and get access to 15 screenings, various installations, and special Ignite events. I went to two of these events. The first was How Films Can Change the World, which was a panel of documentary filmmakers followed by a workshop where you work with other people to come up with a release idea for a hypothetical film. The second was the Festival Filmmaker Speed Dating, where you meet with many of the festivals filmmakers. There was also the Celebrate Sundance Ignite event, which I wasn’t able to attend, where Major Lazer was also in attendance. These events are a great opportunity to not only meet other young filmmakers but also spend some time with, and garner wisdom from, many of the festival filmmakers. 
All in all, Sundance was an unbelievably incredible experience and I’m really happy that I got to do it with a group of amazing people. A huge shootout to Carnegie Mellon University Film Club for making this trip possible. Hopefully, going into next year’s Oscar season, I will be better informed. 
Now that I have made you jealous by telling you stories about all the amazing things I watched, I’m going to devote this last bit to telling you about how you can watch some of the amazing things we saw at the festival. Coming out on Amazon are The Big Sick, and Landline and coming out on Netflix are I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore and The Incredible Jessica James. 
I hope that you too will feel inspired to skip school and run away to Sundance next year.

Piada Italian Street Food, which opened on Forbes Avenue on Jan. 16, is surrounded by many different restaurants, ranging from Pittsburgh icon Primanti Bros. to the ubiquitous McDonald’s. Originally from Ohio, this is the chain’s first Pennsylvanian establishment, with other expansions in Michigan, Indiana, Minnesota, Kentucky, and Texas. Walking into the restaurant there is an immediate contemporary feel, with a minimalist black and white palette, metal accents, and dim lighting that screams young and modern. The space is divided into sections with three different types of seating: bar style, high table, and classic table. The wide mirrors, white-painted brick walls, and large photography posters create an atmosphere of stylish sophistication that lures in the hip college crowd but also attracts the families looking for a trendy night out at a place that's neither fancy nor fast-food. 
Seeking to stand out in the sea of Italian restaurants, Piada Italian Street Food has created a casual, Italian, "Chipotle-style" restaurant, with an assembly line where customers can watch their food being made. Though the line is long during the dinner rush hour, it’s swift, and customers are served quickly. Piada offers a variety of grill items to choose from to add to entrées, such as chicken, calamari, salmon, and vegetables. With the assembly line, we can see exactly what we’re ordering. The servers are friendly and efficient, answering questions about both the restaurant and the food itself. Sticking to a healthier menu, Piada Italian Street Food specializes in piada, an Italian flatbread originating from the Romagna region in northern Italy. They also offer a variety of pastas, salads, soups, and sides. 
The Farm Club Tasca is delicious. A piada flatbread sandwich concoction, it’s made with fried chicken and pancetta topped with sliced avocado, fresh bruschetta tomatoes, arugula, and lemon basil dressing that contrasts the sweet and spicy pickles and spicy balsamic aioli. At the first taste, the diversity of ingredients explodes into different flavors. “I’m a fan,” a friend said.
The Basil Pesto Pasta, topped with a large grass-fed meatball, is also very good. The angel hair pasta itself is of high quality, the fresh basil pesto fragrant and savory, and the sundried tomatoes simultaneously sweet and spicy. The meatball is tender, its distinct sweet taste setting it apart from the standard store-bought meatball. However, with both parmesan alfredo and freshly grated parmesan, the cheese takes away from the basil pesto and the collective taste of the pasta, and could be a little less creamy. 
The Chef’s Favorite Piada, however, is a slight disappointment. Though the rolled flatbread contains romaine lettuce, sweet and spicy peppers, mozzarella, and fresh parmesan, the spicy diavolo sauce overpowers everything else. With too much sauce, the entrée is on the saltier side and becomes one-dimensional, a far cry from the many balanced flavors of the Farm Club Tasca.
Overall, the food is good and made with fresh ingredients, resulting in a relatively authentic Italian palette. Though some dishes are not perfect, the visual aesthetic and the design of the restaurant really help to create a welcoming space for all different types of customers. Piada Italian Street Food has the perfect location in Oakland, at the heart the University of Pittsburgh and neighboring Carnegie Mellon. While seated, I noticed that nearly everyone else in the restaurant was also a student, coming in after their last class of the day, ready for a nice meal and to catch up with friends. Despite the novelty of a new restaurant near campus, Piada Italian Street Food succeeds in an aspect of dining beyond the food itself. It has created a space for people to relax, hang out, and enjoy their food in peace.

A Friday night out with friends in the city is always a good time, especially if you decide to explore an area you’ve never visited before. My friends and I did just that when we went to the hip neighborhood of Lawrenceville, which is not too far from Downtown Pittsburgh. The place is very easy to get around, with little cafés here and there, along with a few vintage stores and cool hangout spots. My friends and I were looking for a place to get dinner when we stumbled upon a Greek restaurant called Pastitsio. It was a small place, but with a classy and comfortable setup. Friends and couples were sitting at the tables next to us, all socializing and having a good time. The entire restaurant gave off a good vibe. 
When our very cordial waiter came to give my friends and me our menus, he went through all of the meals in each category of the menu to describe their taste and how everything was cooked.  I specifically appreciated having the option of choosing the lunch or dinner version of each meal, with the only difference being the prices, and the fact that you can get two sides instead of one for the dinner portion. After the waiter finished showing us our meal options, my friends and I ordered our food, which took about 15 minutes to reach us.
First came the appetizers: hummus and pita bread, Greek meatballs, and spanakopita. My friends and I really enjoyed the hummus, which had this meaty texture to it that very much complemented the warm pita bread. The meatballs were actually complimentary for the restaurant’s happy hour, and were served with tzatziki sauce along with another spicy sauce. The spanakopita, however, was probably our favorite appetizer: small squares of spinach and feta cheese wrapped in flaky phyllo dough. The combination, along with some herbs mixed in, just went so well together. 
When my friends and I got to our main courses, we were just as satisfied with the taste and presentation. A few of us ordered the lamb souvlakia, which was a dish with marinated pieces of lamb and rice, while others ordered the roasted vegetable pita and pastitsio, a sweet casserole made with beef and noodles. Everything was presented nicely on white glass plates and the vibrant colors of the ingredients in each dish made the entire presentation very aesthetically pleasing to look at. 
All of our meals were seasoned perfectly and tasted very unique, where some of them had lightly salty and sour flavors. Even the water tasted great (I think they put mint in it or something). Not to mention, we were told that all the food was made with the freshest ingredients. My friends and I all enjoyed the entire experience of eating at Pastitsio, where we were able to both explore more of a food culture and catch up with each other at the same time.

No matter how old I get, snow days still feel like a sort of everyday magic — especially now that they’re fewer and further in between. Waking up to a phone call or email bearing the good news, I’m 11 again, squealing with excitement. No work, and I don’t even have to feel guilty!
In the snow day state of mind, there’s nothing to worry about. The world only extends as far as you want it to. Maybe it’s only as far as the window where you sit in your pajamas, mesmerized by each falling flake, or trying to catch glimpses of your neighbors to make sure there’s still life out there. Or maybe you take to the couch and turn on a movie to extend the world a little further, maybe the whole way to Platform 9 ¾ or even a wormhole to another dimension.
On these days, time feels stolen, like a personal day you didn’t ask for but offered up by Mother Nature who, with her maternal intuition, sensed you could use the time off. She gives us all the permission to forget what may come tomorrow and thoroughly enjoy today. This really is magical.
But what’s a magic show without a little popcorn? It may be too late to drive to the grocery store to pick up extra special snow day snackies, leaving you with only what you already have at your disposal. But I’m willing to bet you at least have sugar, milk, and vanilla extract floating around your kitchen, maybe some powdered drink mix or a little booze, too.
Lace up your snow boots and zip up your puffiest coat. The only missing ingredient? Snow! Because the whole day already feels a few degrees away from reality, the perfect snack to celebrate the magic takes advantage of the bounty that Mother Nature has bestowed. It’s like reaping the day’s harvest of whimsy. There’s almost a silliness to enjoying a cold snack on a cold day. Wrapped up in pajamas and blankets, safe next to the radiator, you’re safe from the cold snap of the outside air. If you close your eyes while you cool down with a fresh snowy snow cone, you can almost picture the poolside cabana you could be lying in. Still from your room, the world grows a little larger once again. 
The best part, though, is the treasure hunt for a bowlful of perfectly clean, untouched, and un-peed-upon snow. Later in the day this can be a fun challenge. Each serving requires about four cups of snow, packed as hard as you can.
Vanilla Snow Cone
The classic. 
• 4 cups of snow
• 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
• ¼ cup of sugar
• ½ cup of milk
Combine ingredients and stir.
Kool-Aid Snow Cone
The nostalgic.
• 4 cups of snow
• 4 tablespoons of presweetened Kool-Aid mix
Combine and stir. If you have the Kool-Aid packets that do not come presweetened, add two tablespoons of sugar.
Frozen Margarita
You can pretend you’re at the beach.
• 4 cups of snow
• 5 ounces of tequila
• 2 ½ ounces of triple sec
• ½ cup of lime juice
• ¼ cup of simple syrup (heat ¼ cup each of sugar and water until dissolved)
Mix margarita ingredients until chilled. Pour over a glass of packed snow.
Frozen Irish Coffee
This one’s for Mommy.
• 4 cups of snow
• 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
• ¼ cup of sugar
• ¼ cup of coffee
• ¼ cup of Irish cream
Combine all the ingredients and stir.
Maple Snow Candy
Bonus treat.
• sheet tray full of snow
• ½ cup of pure maple syrup
Boil maple syrup until a thermometer reads 255 degrees Fahrenheit. Slowly pour the maple syrup in strips onto the tray of snow. It will instantly harden into a chewy candy.

Dear Jade,
I did it. I made it through Super Bowl Sunday. It took a lot of nodding vacantly, yelling because everyone else is, and shoving my mouth full of guac to avoid making conversation. But I made it through with my social status relatively intact. I even got a reputation as a champion guac eater out of it! But it doesn't really matter. The relentless sports season calendar marches on, and I'll be facing baseball season soon enough. (shudders) 
See, the thing is, I am absolutely hopeless when it comes to sports. Football, soccer, basketball, hockey … you name it, I don’t get it. I’ve had the rules explained a hundred times. God, I even played soccer growing up. I still have absolutely no idea what’s going on on the field. I can’t even spot the ball 90 percent of the time. And don’t even get me started on hockey. I’m not convinced anyone knows where the puck is or what’s going on till a fight breaks out. 
In the past, my abysmal understanding of sports didn’t matter. But now that I’m at college, it’s coming back to bite me. Friends ask me out to sports bars to “watch the game.” (What game? What sport are they even talking about? What is the code that clues me in to which game is “the” game?) The boyfriend wants to stay in on Sunday to watch football. And then there are the dreaded high holy days of sports: the World Cup, the World Series, and, of course, the Super Bowl. Sports are suddenly everywhere in my life! This is the kind of thing I came to Carnegie Mellon to avoid! How do I fake my way through these social events? I don’t want people to know I don’t know what’s going on and feel like they need to teach me for the thousandth time or, worse, think I’m bored and not invite me next time. I love the chips and dip too much for that! 
Please teach me how to be a pretend Sports fan.
Sincerely,
Sadly People Overly React to Sports
Dear SPORTS,
First of all I'd like to say: CELEBRITY SHOT! I'm standing in for Sarah this week, but I'm sure I'll be able to help you out. I understand your troubles. It can be hard to be out of the loop when everyone seems to be fluent in a lingo that you have no idea about (pretty much me whenever someone talks about baseball). But, there are ways to overcome these troubles!
My boyfriend experienced a similar issue. Everyone would ask him about football and to deter attention, he used to say that his favorite team was the worst and arguably most hated team in the NFL, the Cleveland Browns. After a while, he started to acquire an actual interest in this team. It did kind of backfire in his case, because he ended up being an actual fan of the actual worst team in the NFL, but I think that's the whole reason it worked. He picked the worst team and so no one ever wanted to talk to him about football.
Try finding an unpopular team from each sport, and when you say that's your team, everyone will be so filled with disgust that they'll never ask you about sports again! They'll still invite you to watch parties because they'll be able to see that you clearly have an interest in sports. 
But you should also maybe try giving sports an honest try. My dad always said that one good thing about sports is that they could make an awkward conversation a lot less awkward. Say you see a recruiter at EncompassCMU wearing a Steelers hat. Mention their performance this season and you've already got an icebreaker! For some reason, people think that other people who like the same sports teams as them must be good people, so the recruiter will automatically think you're trustworthy and that you have a good sense of judgment. 
Sports can also be genuinely fun to engage in if you love smack talk and making fun of other people's opinions. I'd really give it a try sometime because you might be surprised how exciting you find sports when you end up rooting for a team that you've invested a lot of years in.

A magnificent fire and the spirit of centuries of tradition come together at the Punjabi folk festival entitled Lohri. Traditionally, Lohri is celebrated around the time of the Winter Solstice, and brings with it warmth to pull Northern Indians through the rest of the bitter winter cold. The lighting of the bonfire symbolizes the promise of longer days to come, and makes the celebration an ideal time for families and friends to come together.
OM, the Hindu, Sikh, and Jain spirituality group on campus, spends a night every January giving students at Carnegie Mellon the opportunity to engage in the warmth that is Lohri. This year, the celebration was held on Friday, Feb. 3, behind Stever House on Morewood Avenue.
To raise awareness and advertise the event, OM hosted a photo contest, where participants were challenged to snap "Pics with Punjabis" around campus. Punjabis themselves were not allowed to participate, except as the Punjabi of another in a selfie, but prizes were distributed for both the non-Punjabis with the most selfies, and the most captured Punjabi on campus.
During a typical Lohri celebration in India, items are thrown into a bonfire. Most often this includes snacks made from sesame seeds and jaggery, called "chikki," and a variation made with peanuts, that my own mother has dubbed "Indian peanut brittle." These foods are known to bring warmth to the body, and the sweet jaggery that holds it together gives all its consumers a little kick of much-needed energy. With the progression of more modern celebrations of the festival, the list of items has extended to include popcorn, peanuts, puffed rice, and what ever else will keep the fire roaring. 
To bring a relatable edge to the CMU celebration of Lohri, OM provided snacks to roast in the fire, along with the items meant for tossing. The result was a gathering of people in search of a warm fire and great snacks, mixed in with those on campus who were far away from their families, but celebrating with them in spirit. 
It is inclusive campus events like this that I find to be truly inspiring. Bringing flair and accessibility to complement what is always a fun and energetic celebration, these events make learning about the many cultures we have here on campus an enjoyable and seamless experience.  With the dark of the night and the chill of the winter, the fire symbolized something more this past Friday night, behind Stever. It symbolized togetherness, in a time where we may have not expected it, but sure were glad to have it.

On Tuesday, Jan. 31, Dr. John Silvanus Wilson Jr., president of Morehouse College, the first privately-established liberal arts college dedicated to the education of African-American males in the country, gave a lecture titled “Toward the Beloved Community.”
Wilson has dedicated more than 25 years to achieving a more socially conscious education. He started his education career serving at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  and George Washington University. He also served as the president of the Greater Boston Morehouse College Alumni Association (GBMCAA).
An educator, scholar, consultant, and strategist,  Wilson has served in many other organizations such as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and United Negro College Fund’s Institute for Capacity Building. Prior to being the president for Morehouse College, President Barack Obama appointed Wilson to serve as the executive director of the White House Initiative on HBCUs, a position Wilson held since 2009. With his great abilities and efforts, Wilson has made great achievements for the universities and organizations with his vision.
Wilson’s lecture was based on a recent article he wrote for The Huffington Post, where he talked about how Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. changed from the 1963 “I have a dream” King, which references his famous speech delivered in front of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pond, to the more “angry King,” as witnessed in his 1967 speech at New York City’s Riverside Church. This  version of Dr. King said “we need a reconstruction of the entire society; a revolution of values,” and proclaimed that “America is much, much sicker than I realized when I first began working in 1955,” due to its falling democracy, both socially and economically. Wilson’s lecture focused on the reasons behind King’s change.
Wilson believes that, in 2017, everyone in the United States has a lot more to learn from the wiser and more measured “angry King”— the King who said “we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values.”
Wilson believes that a lot of factors from 1963 and 1967 contributed to this shift in King, and believes that the factors which caused his shift are very similar to today’s situation.
He talked about three big lessons which could be learned from King in 1967.
The first is the necessity of moral intelligence, which is the socially responsible intelligence. According to King, education should equip students to do good as they do well for themselves. The second is aspiration intelligence. As King said, it’s a mistake to choose chaos rather than community as our future, and we need to have intelligence in our aspiration. According to King, education is the way out of this mistake, the way to increase people’s moral and aspirational intelligence. The third is capital intelligence and its importance in education and many other institutions.
Chelsea N. Jones, currently a master’s student in public policy and management at the Heinz College, was the student speaker this year accompanying Dr. Wilson. Her talk was about how “you do not have to be a radical to make a radical difference.” She believes that “the best way for us to unify is to listen. Not just to hear, but to understand.”

Carnegie Mellon annually awards the Dickson Prize in Science to “individuals in the United States who make outstanding contributions to science.” This year’s award, which includes both a medal and a cash prize, went to Chad A. Mirkin, director of the International Institute for Nanotechnology and the George B. Rathmann Professor of Chemistry at Northwestern University.
Mirkin has been the recipient of over a hundred national and international honors and is one of fewer than 20 individuals who have been elected to all three National Science academies — the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine. He has also played a role in creating science policy during the Obama administration, as he served as a member of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science & Technology. He is one of the top cited chemists in the world, with over 670 publications and nearly 300 patents to his name. He is also the founding editor of Small, a journal dedicated to nanotechnology.
Mirkin accepted the Dickson award on Feb. 2 and gave a lecture titled “Nanotechnology: Small Things Matter” at Carnegie Mellon, which was followed by a reception.
According to Mirkin, a nanoscale object is defined as an object which has at least one dimension — length, width, or height — that is between one and 100 nanometers.
The lecture started with an introduction to the history of nanotechnology. A historical use of nanoparticles was in the stained-glass windows that adorned many historical buildings, even though people didn’t know that at the time these buildings were being designed and built. Mirkin then delved into the modern period of nanotechnology expansion and research. While it is difficult to pinpoint an exact start to this modern period, Mirkin pointed to a lecture by Richard Feynman at the California Institute of Technology called “Plenty of Room at the Bottom”, in which Feynman hypothesized that we may be able to arrange atoms in exactly the way we want in the future, and a nanotechnology research initiative spearheaded by then-president Clinton in 2000, as catalysts for the growth in interest in nanotechnology in the past few decades.
Mirkin emphasized that nanoscale objects can have very different properties from their macroscale counterparts. An example of a property that changes with size (and shape) is Rayleigh scattering — the scattering of light by the particles themselves. He showed a slide comparing the scattering colors of different gold and silver nano particles. For example, gold spheres at the scale of 100 nanometers correspond to a yellow-orange color while gold spheres at around 50 nanometers correspond to a light green color. This is why stained-glass windows could maintain their bright hues over centuries without degradation, unlike most paints.
He also mentioned various technologies that are needed in order to manipulate objects on a smaller-than microscopic scale. These include the scanning electron microscope, the transmission electron microscope, and the scanning tunneling microscope.
The atomic force microscope is used in dip-pen nanolithography, the technique of using a microscopic tip — which could be made of different materials, such as rubber or harder spring-like materials — to print patterns using different kinds of “inks” on various solid substrates. Mirkin played a major role in developing the technique of dip-pen nanolithography, eventually expanding it to a printing method containing tens of thousand of tips. There are wide-ranging applications because this technology allows the manipulation of different substrates (such as biosensors) at the submicroscopic scale. Thus, this nanolithography method was recognized by National Geographic as one of the 100 discoveries that changed the world.
Mirkin emphasized the theme of applying nanotechnology in biology and medicine. He mentioned Verigene, a test developed by one of his companies that looks for gene abnormality or infection in a patient’s blood and allows better diagnosis, reduces cost, and lessens the prescriptions of needless antibiotics, which can cause antibiotic resistance. It reads the DNA of a patient and through this information can detect genetic mutations and sensitivity to different drugs. In addition, his group played a major role in developing spherical nucleic acids, which are nucleic acids “wrapped” around an inorganic nanoscale core. This allows them to penetrate cells and take measures on them while they are alive, opening up the possibilities of personalized treatment or medicine.
There are still many challenges for expanding this combination of medicine and nanotechnology, mostly because humans are living beings with unique chemical environments. “Developing and understanding how new types of drugs can work in living systems is not a trivial process, and it requires a lot of refining and a lot of experiments,” said Mirkin in an interview with The Tartan.
However, despite the challenges, Mirkin sees a lot of potential for the field of nanotechnology in the future. “I think nanotechnology is the answer to two major unmet medical needs—one is the ability to get DNA and RNA-based drugs into organs where you can flip genetic switches and correct disease, and where you can harness a patient’s immune system to create new types of cancer vaccines,” said Mirkin.
Perhaps the smallest technologies available to us is the next “big thing” in terms of making progress with some of the most challenging areas for medical researchers today.

On Thursday Feb. 2, John Fabian Witt, the speaker at the sixth annual Thomas M. Kerr Jr. lecture, discussed the subject of American Freedom. Witt is the Duffy Class of 1960 Professor of Law at Yale Law School and author of award-winning book, Lincoln’s Code: The Laws of War in American History and has worked at Columbia University, the University of Texas at Austin, and also received his education at Yale University, where he currently works.
Witt visited Carnegie Mellon University as part of the Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholars program. Phi Beta Kappa, founded in 1776, is the nation’s most prestigious academic honor society. Its goal is to support education in the liberal arts and sciences, recognize academic excellence, and engender freedom of thought.
The title of Witt’s lecture was “The Switch: The Twentieth-Century Reinvention of American Freedom.” Over the course of his speech, he took the audience back in time to the early 20th century, to a time where the First Amendment of the Constitution did not carry the same weight as it does today. He would go on to discuss the course of human rights, how they would change, and what lessons we can learn from the past to apply to the present and future.
He started his lecture by recounting the election of President Warren G. Harding in 1920. Harding was an unlikely choice for the Republican party since there seemed to be more experienced people that the party could have chosen as nominee. However, due to some political maneuvering, he ended up with the nomination and ran against James Cox. This election had implications for the nation since it demonstrated a turn from traditional values and “second raters” were able to win elections.
At the same time, there were many riots and labor strikes going on around the country. One famous failure occurred here in Pittsburgh, in which the Pennsylvania state militia arrived to quell hostilities. The Strike, as it became to be known, is a telling moment in American history, Witt explained, as it demonstrated how the human collective now rallied around what Witt calls “un-reassured politics.”
“Un-reassured politics” refers to the newspapers back then. Witt stated that they were “systematically misleading their readers.” He drew a connection from the lack of responsibility in the 1920s to the modern era, in which there have been many accusations levied against modern news sites for extreme bias. He urged the audience to consider their news sources, and consider whether we are making better choices now than almost 100 years ago.
Witt then went on to discuss the four most important domains of social life which reinterpreted how we use free speech. According to him, these are the arts, the work done on free speech by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), labor movements, and the actions by the state.
An example of the arts influencing free speech are plays and movies that, by modern terms, would be deemed racist. However, in one anecdote Witt shared, he explained that one movie which was boycotted for its racism was written by a man who would eventually lead the NAACP. So was it within his power to write it, or was it a violation of free speech to ban the movie?
The ACLU changed our interpretation of what free speech means. Before this era, you could be jailed for saying the wrong thing, an idea that goes against the grain of our modern values. By fighting against things such as the Espionage Act, which incriminated people that spoke against the war effort, they changed the meaning of free speech to what we identify it as today.
Labor movements were also useful in the change of the 1920s. Both public and private strikes were common in this era, and were one of the defining characteristics of this generation.
Finally, the actions and attitudes of the federal government also influenced this change, which Witt titles “the switch.” With a newfound desire to increase the rights of its population, actions such as the Scopes Trial increased “civil liberties,” a term that began its usage around this era. Thus, a new era of constitutional interpretation was born.
At the end of his speech, Witt asked the audience to consider how we can use the lessons of the past in the present. He urged us to think critically about our rights and how people fought to protect them, and elaborate upon them.

Carnegie Mellon recently received a joint $16.5 million donation from Professor José Moura, Professor Manuela Veloso, Adjunct Professor Aleksandar  Kavcic, and Dr. Sofija Kavcic in the hopes of helping the University with research and education in engineering and data science.
All of the donors have extremely strong ties to the Carnegie Mellon community. Moura works in Carnegie Mellon’s Electrical and Computer Engineering Department as the Philip L. and Marsha Dowd University Professor. Veloso is associated with the Machine Learning Department as the Herbert A. Simon University Professor in Computer Science and Robotics. Alek Kavcic was once a doctoral student at Carnegie Mellon and recently agreed to an adjunct position in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Sofija Kavcic worked with an architectural firm in Hawaii.
Moura and Alek Kavcic made the money for this donation through their own research and study. While Kavcic was a Ph.D. student under Moura’s supervision, the two created and patented a detector that had the ability to pick up recorded data from disk drivers that were shrinking in size. Since being developed in the early 2000s, the detector became necessary to gather correct information from weak signals that were at times interfered with by stronger noises when dealing with magnetic recording density. Around 60 percent of computers produced within the last 14 years have this detector which allows users to access correctly saved data.
“This gift will provide new opportunities and resources for students and researchers in data science and engineering,” President Subra Suresh said in a University press release. “We are grateful to José, Manuela, Alek, and Sofija for their personal philanthropy and generosity to CMU, which will help build upon the university’s pioneering and interdisciplinary work into the future. The invention of José and Alek is an example of how fundamental research can change real-world systems. It transformed data storage and made a tremendous impact on CMU, and their gift will make a significant difference for future students and researchers for many years to come.”
This group’s donation is intended to finance education and research programs in the College of Engineering, School of Computer Science, and the Department of Statistics. One particular goal of this fund is to foster relationships between quantitative scientists and technologists from those various schools. Furthermore, these professors intend for this donation to help support Carnegie Mellon’s Data Storage Systems Center.
“We live in a society awash with data,” Moura said in the press release. “With its exceptionally talented faculty and students, Carnegie Mellon has an opportunity to lead the nation in finding the new solutions to acquire, store, access, transmit, and intelligently process these data, so we can have better healthcare, better education, better business solutions, better engineering, and more fulfilling jobs.”
Moura has been a member of the Carnegie Mellon family since 1986 when he became a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. He also has a courtesy appointment in the Department of Biomedical Engineering. Before coming to Carnegie Mellon, Moura was a faculty member at Instituto Superior Técnico, the Engineering School of the Technical University of Lisbon in Portugal.
“The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering is proud of professor José Moura and Alek Kavcic’s revolutionary work in signal processing,” says Jelena Kovacevic, the Hamerschlag University Professor and head of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. “We thank them for their gift to the university and college. This gift will ensure support for students and research in the field for years to come.”

Carnegie Mellon’s propensity for empathy is always highlighted at times of drastic change. Trump’s new immigration policy poses a lot of changes to Carnegie Mellon students. Trump’s executive order, released on Jan. 27, limited immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries for 90 days from the date of the order, as well as suspended the United States Refugee Admissions Program. This was preceded by an executive order issued on Jan. 25 to begin construction on the wall between the U.S. and Mexico which Donald Trump promised during his campaign under the similar pretense of national security. This act of specifically addressing different types of immigrants within his orders as threats to our nation’s safety, paired with increased immigration regulation and surveillance, has left many unsure of their permanence or state of welcome in the United States.
Carnegie Mellon’s response to this, as always, has taken a very thoughtful approach of constructive conversation and sharing of experiences. Across the board, very few places on campus have kept quiet about the changes in our country. From faculty to staff to students, the Carnegie Mellon community is coming together to make sure that the significance of these immigration changes is not left understated. President Suresh publicly declared a stance of support for immigrants and the Mechanical Engineering department hosted a town hall on immigration.
In terms of related talks, Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) hosted an event on Sunday, Feb. 5 for students affected by these executive orders to provide a place for discussion and support. My Facebook feed has been flooded with insightful articles and phone numbers of representatives you can call to voice your opinion. There are so many places on campus to speak about your ideas on these new actions and so many places to listen to students who may feel personally affected by these changes.
So where does the Student Body President’s Cabinet lie in this? We stand firmly in support of the right of every student to get an education and to feel safe in the space they’re in. We hope to act upon this by continuing to support the free exchange of ideas, like at Pizza and Conversations. However, if you have any ideas on events you want to see hosted, you can always stop by office hours on Thursdays or contact anyone on Cabinet. In case you have any questions about the event or how CaPS intersects with these executive orders, you can always email outreach-at-caps@andrew.cmu.edu.

Professor Peter Cooke named Member of the Order of Australia
Professor Peter Cooke, head of the Carnegie Mellon University School of Drama, was named a Member of the Order of Australia in the Australia Day Honors List on Jan. 26.  
The Order of Australia was established by Queen Elizabeth II in 1975, with membership being bestowed upon Australian citizens as recognition of achievements or meritorious service. Professor Cooke will receive this honor at a ceremony in Sydney in May.
According to a Carnegie Mellon press release, Professor Cooke has over thirty years of international experience as a theater practitioner, administrator, and educator. He has expressed his honor and joy at receiving such a prestigious award for his "significant service to the performing arts, and education, as an academic and administrator, particularly theatre and dance." 
Dr. Subra Suresh, President of Carnegie Mellon University, has congratulated Professor Cooke on his award, stating that Professor Cooke’s professional and leadership activities have had a profound impact on the School of Drama and Carnegie Mellon. Dan Martin, dean of the College of Fine Arts, has also extended his congratulations to Professor Cooke, lauding him as one of the best heads of the school he’s known in his nearly 25 years at Carnegie Mellon, as well as crediting his leadership for solidifying the School of Drama’s position as the leading theater education center in the United States.
PWSA Boil-Water Order cuts off campus water
On Jan. 31, the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) issued a precautionary flush and boil order for drinking water supplies across much of the city. 
The PWSA found low levels of free chlorine in the drinking water at a single location near the Highland Park. The advisory was thus issued as a precaution.
This order resulted in all water fountains on Carnegie Mellon’s campus being shut off. Students living in dormitories, such as Fairfax Apertment, The Highland Aprtment, Shady Oak Apartments, Neville Apartments, and Webster Hall were affected on the first day of this advisory. By the second day, all dormitories were affected.
The university secured nearly 20,000 bottles of water to distribute to the campus community due to expectations that the boil-water order would continue for several days, according to a university press release.
Yet by Feb. 2, the PWSA lifted the boil water order and declared that there was no longer a potential risk to the drinking water supply, though the university has advised students to let taps run for two minutes before drinking the water and resuming normal procedures as a precaution.

It has only been a few months since the Democratic Party lost the election, and it seems like they have already started to forget one of the primary causes of their failure: trade. Liberal institutions such as The New York Times have taken advantage of the fact that the Trump administration adopted anti-trade policies to undermine a legitimate position. They have grouped exiting the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as part of the larger xenophobic narrative that has caused the Muslim ban and the funding of a wall on the border with Mexico.
Ever since Trump ended the deal, it has been decried as yet another political blunder by the inexperienced administration as well as a complete upheaval of one of Barack Obama’s trademark policies. However, this brand of reporting creates the impression that, since Trump opposes a policy that Obama enthusiastically supported, Trump must be implementing a foolish policy. By adopting this course of action, the liberal elite risk further alienating their blue-collar electorate whose abandonment of the party resulted in Trump’s ascendancy.
In the primaries, the Bernie Sanders candidacy revealed the deep division in the Democratic Party between skilled white-collar elites and blue-collar working people that had lost their jobs due to prior trade agreements. Hillary Clinton’s past endorsement of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and her support of the TPP hurt her in the primaries and during the general election as Trump continuously attacked her for her pro-trade stance.
Many liberals and their economic experts dismiss anti-trade positions as the same brand of mindless populism that led to the election of Trump, and believe that his supporters are inspired by the xenophobic forces behind anti-immigration policies. These fallacious arguments are designed to invalidate the anti-trade forces within the democratic party by associating them with Trump.
Before accepting this false association, one must consider that progressive icons such as Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have vehemently opposed the TPP, and with good reason. Though the TPP has received support from Barack Obama and other prominent Democrats, they represent the neoliberal wing of the party that blindly promotes free markets with no limitations. Proponents of this deal claim, as with all other trade deals, that this would greatly benefit the American economy.
When NAFTA was ratified by Congress, it was promoted as a deal that would immensely improve the American economy. Yet in retrospect, experts agree that it improved the GDP by less than 0.5%. At the same time, workers in highly paid manufacturing positions lost their jobs, because the products they were making could be created with lower costs in Mexico’s low wage economic environment. This greatly influenced the manufacturing-based industries in states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Ohio. Not only were old jobs lost, but new manufacturing jobs that otherwise would have been created in America were instead created in Mexico, as that led to companies incurring lower costs of production. By not adding to America’s manufacturing jobs, this indirectly harmed many members of the workforce.
While NAFTA harmed the manufacturing sector of the American economy, the TPP threatened to undermine the very sovereignty of all governments involved in the deal, and their ability to protect their citizens.
Through the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provisions, foreign companies could sue governments for enacting policies that harm their profits. Essentially, if a Japanese company deemed an American environmental regulation harmful to its profits or a drug safety standard to be too costly to abide by, they could sue the American government for the loss of profit.
These disputes are settled by private arbitration panels composed largely of unelected corporate lawyers who are not accountable to anyone. The settlements reached by these panels could force governments to abandon a regulatory law that would protect or improve the lives of its citizens. The TPP would undermine the power of governments involved in the deal and lead to companies dictating how countries are governed. By suing governments for large sums of money they cannot afford, corporations could have controlled which regulatory statutes a country can establish. As a result, foreign corporations would gain an unprecedented level of influence over governments.
Recent media attacks on the anti-trade stance have not addressed any of these concerns, but have been aimed to convince the public that trade deals have become the victim of the same brand of populism and xenophobia that caused Brexit and the election of Trump. However, people oppose these deals because they have never been designed to help the American worker, or even the American government. Instead, their purpose was to advance the cause of the lobbyists who helped write the agreement in complete secrecy. Continuing to pursue this strategy would not only be harmful for working class people, but for the democratic party itself.
Democrats have always been on the side of labor and working people, yet in this election the party lost due to its failure to secure those votes. The last time the Democratic party lost in the states of Pennsylvania and Michigan was back during the Reagan-Bush Era. As trade became such a large issue in this election cycle, the people of these states could not support a candidate who spent her entire career championing these trade policies.
To move forward, Democrats need to adopt a united stance on trade. They can no longer blindly promote and defend their neoliberal ideology and expect the electorate to accept it. That strategy worked before since no candidate on either side opposed corporate-friendly trade deals.
With the rise of authoritarian populists and general anti-trade, isolationist attitudes around the world, Democrats finally have an incentive to correct their stance on trade. In general, trade deals with the right parameters and negotiated by both corporations and labor have the potential to be beneficial for all parties involved. Deals such as the TPP however, were created with no transparency to the public and advisory boards composed of lobbyists from large corporations advising negotiators from each of the countries. A deal drafted by corporate lobbyists is bound to reflect the interests of those same corporations. The party should not denounce trade but rather endorse fair trade deals that represent a balance of interests between corporations as well as labor. If it fails to do so, they risk further dividing the Democratic party amongst socioeconomic lines, which could spur the destruction of the Democratic party.

The countless headlines last week have left a number of Americans questioning the lack of limits on authority that has been granted to presidents through executive orders. This fear is justifiable, as the idea of any individual having the power to make such orders is both frightening and a risk to the welfare of this nation. However, this is nothing new and is something that should have been considered long before the election of President Trump.
With Trump’s immigration order, we saw just how damaging this kind of policy can be to the nation if left unchecked. Is this newfound concern a result of recent times, or something that has been left unchecked throughout the history of our nation?
Executive orders date to the beginning of this nation and originate from Article II of the Constitution, through which the president is granted “executive power.” It directs presidents to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” This does not give the president the authority to create new laws or allocate new funding from the treasury. It simply allows them to use laws and funding that already exist to carry out actions.
As controversial as they may be, most executive orders simply enforce ignored laws that have existed for years. Trump’s wall order did not allocate new funding to the building of a wall. It simply directed the Department of Homeland Security to use existing funding to expand the physical barriers at the border. Something as significant as a border fence that costs billions must go through Congress for legitimacy.  The Secure Fence Act of 2006, which called for 700 miles of physical barriers on the border, did just this. 
A look at the change in the way executive orders have been used throughout history still brings uneasiness. The first 17 presidents each signed fewer than eighty executive orders, with most signing far fewer than that. In the entirety of George Washington’s presidency, he signed only eight executive orders according to The American Presidency Project. In the first week of Trump’s presidency, he signed seven. A comparison between the executive orders of the first and second halves of American presidents has shown just how much their role has expanded in American politics throughout history. George W. Bush penned 291 orders and Barack Obama, 276. This is nowhere near the record of 3,721 signed by Franklin D. Roosevelt.
With such a high number of executive orders, sometimes the line between an order that creates a new law and an order that utilizes existing laws is not always clear. Take for instance, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Executive Order 9066, which imprisoned hundreds of thousands of Japanese-Americans in one of the most controversial decisions of American history. If one man can make the decision to unjustly imprison hundreds of thousands of American citizens through executive order, it becomes clear that executive order grants the president far more power than interpreting and enforcing existing laws. The power to revoke legal residency and visas without any justification or legislative approval whatsoever has also now gone beyond just enforcing existing laws.
While the power granted by them is unsettling, executive orders have also shaped U.S. history. Both the Louisiana Purchase and the Emancipation Proclamation were a result of executive orders from Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln, respectively. More recently, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals has granted amnesty to hundreds of thousands of immigrants who have called America home since childhood. Executive orders can be used for good but their potential for destruction is large enough (as we saw with Roosevelt and are now seeing with Trump) that we should not let them go unchecked; there must be some limit placed on them.
With over 14,000 executive orders signed into action, it’s clear that whether or not we like it, executive orders have been a major part of American history. With President Trump, Americans are now being awakened to the possible negativities of granting such power to one individual. With both the executive and legislative branches being controlled by the same party, the potential power that Trump could have through if executive orders are left unchecked is troubling. However, as we saw with a federal judge’s order to halt Trump’s immigration policy for visa holders, there is a limit on executive orders and as long as we remain cautious and wary of the possibilities, we can prevent the next generation of American internment camps.

On Jan. 27, 2017, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order: Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States, which prohibits citizens and refugees from seven majority-Muslim countries from traveling and emmigrating to the United States. The order has enforced a 90-day ban on all entry into the U.S. for those coming from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Travelers trying to enter the United States from these countries have faced indefinite airport detainment, and at least 60,000 visas have been revoked.  U.S. citizens and dual-citizens from one of the seven banned countries will be admitted on a case-by-case basis.
There has also been a restructuring of the United States’ refugee program. Despite the United States’ refugee vetting system being one of the strictest in the world, Trump believes there is more the government should be doing. The entire refugee admissions system has been entirely shut down for 120 days, and the Syrian refugee program has been suspended indefinitely. Religion has become the basis for the admission of refugees, with an emphasis on admitting refugees who are of a minority faith in their country. The order has forced many already-admitted refugees into an uncomfortable limbo, making them unsure of the future of their place here.
Before analyzing the obvious moral wrongdoings of this executive order, let’s first discuss the illegitimacy of its institution. In 1962, Executive Order 11303  was signed to dictate and standardize how further orders should be prepared, filed, and published. Order 11303 states that any proposed order must be signed by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and by the Justice Department. Both the Justice Department and the OMB denied to respond when asked if Trump’s order had been through this process. Whether or not you agree with the order, it should be at the very least concerning that the Trump administration has seemingly no interest in behaving in accordance with precedent.
The executive order has widely been referred to as a “Muslim Ban,” and has received support from members of the Republican party, including Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan. Unsurprisingly and deservingly, the order has also received a lot of backlash. Several lawsuits have emerged and countless protests have been filling airports around the nation. Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, who has since been fired for her opposition, believes the ban is unconstitutional due to it’s targeting of a particular religion. However, the Trump administration has made its attempts to discourage the idea that the executive order is a ban against Muslims.
It is admittedly hard to believe that the administration does not equate Islam with terror when the seven countries included in the ban are all countries where the majority religion is Islam. However, many are wondering why, if Trump’s goal is to prevent terrorism, countries whose citizens have committed acts of terror against the United States have not been included in the ban. It is also difficult to view this as anything other than a Muslim ban when the executive order has barred Syrian refugees, but will make exceptions for Christian refugees.
The executive order does not use the word “Muslim” in its language, but Trump’s statements tell a different story. In 2015, Trump stated that the United States should implement a “complete shutdown of Muslims,” and ban them from entering the country because “most Muslims protect terrorists.” These claims are dangerously untrue. In 2016, Trump stated he does not intend to distinguish between radical Islam and peaceful followers because “you don’t know who is who.” Some time later he claimed that Muslims are trying to “take over our children and convince them how wonderful ISIS is.” This was yet another grossly incorrect and offensive statement by the then-president-elect. When asked by a reporter in December, following his recent election, if he still believed in creating a Muslim registry, he responded, “you know my plans.”
If you weigh the rhetoric of the order with the astoundingly offensive and misleading comments made by Trump, it is clear that the goal of his administration is not as well-intentioned as the administration would like us to believe.
The order is not the only border-control measure that the administration is working on. Trump has voiced his plans for a wall that will span the length of the southern border of the United States. It’s obvious that this measure targets one group of people.
Whether or not you support the wall is irrelevant in understanding that Trump has misled the American people countless times. Trump has convinced supporters of the wall that it will stop illegal immigration at our borders. There are several flaws with this logic.  Firstly, analysts from the Department of Defense believe the majority of illegal immigration is done via air travel. Secondly, visa-overstayers make up a vast majority of illegal immigrants, not those who illegally cross the border. Thirdly, illegal immigration in states who share a border with Mexico is declining, while it has been increasing in more distant states like Washington, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and others.
Trump maintains that the wall should cost $8 billion, but experts from MIT agree that a much more realistic price tag is anywhere between $25 and $40 billion. There is a significant lack of funding for the construction of more secure fencing, let alone a wall of this size. Trump has also misled supporters into believing that he could force Mexico into paying for the wall. Realistically, money for this project would have to come from U.S. taxpayers or a tax on imports. Large border projects have been attempted before. In a report from the Department of Homeland Security, it is estimated that the government has wasted $69 million in taxpayer dollars trying to build border walls, proving that the wall is both geographically irrelevant and an economic disaster.
Let’s pretend that the border wall is economically feasible and that Trump’s true goal is to protect U.S. citizens. This does not make up for the immorality of his plans. The United States was founded on the idea that anyone, of any religion, should be free and safe from persecution. The Statue of Liberty reads: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” President Trump’s plans for our nation’s borders has turned away the tired and the poor. They have turned away those yearning to breathe free. There is beauty in diversity. Our diversity can make us a strong, compassionate nation if we give those around us the chance to live a free and prosperous life, a life that everyone on this Earth is entitled to.

Last week, I made a terrible mistake: I engaged in a political debate on Facebook. My opponent was a family friend with a familiar and increasingly frustrating argument. Basically, she expressed her unhappiness with how polarized and angry everyone has gotten since the election, and argued that everyone should just try to get along and “choose love.” I argued that was a load of unproductive, idealistic crap. Don’t get me wrong. This family friend is a perfectly nice person with good intentions. But in these strange and terrifying times, “niceness” is exactly what I’ve got a problem with.
Niceness is valuable in ordinary circumstances. You could even say it’s the glue that keeps civil society together. Saying “please” and “thank you,” smiling at the appropriate times, and making pleasant small talk allow people to calmly navigate their days without killing each other.
However, little more than a week of T****’s reign has proved that these are far from ordinary circumstances. My personal worst-case scenario for the next four years is the rise of a global far-right neo-fascist state. If you think such fears are overblown, consider Holocaust Museum’s new sign for “The Early Warning Signs of Fascism,” which went viral over the weekend.
Let’s do a brief run-through. “Powerful and continuing nationalism” – check, see every ugly red hat reading “Make America Great Again.” “Disdain for human rights,” “identification of enemies as a unifying force,” “obsession with national security,” “religion and government intertwined” – check, check, check, check, see the Muslim Ban. “Corporate power protected” – check, T****’s countless violations of conflict of interest laws. “Disdain for intellectuals and the arts” – Hamilton, SNL, need I go on? “Obsession with crime and punishment” – have you read his Twitter? “Rampant cronyism and corruption” – have you seen his inner circle? “Rampant sexism” – well, that’s just par for the course among right-wingers. Is this starting to feel ominous yet? The only signs T**** hasn’t explicitly hit are “Labor power suppressed” and “supremacy of the military,” but keep your eyes peeled for the legalization of running over protesters and the Trumpian Gestapo.
In extraordinary circumstances, the true colors of niceness are revealed. The daughter of a Holocaust survivor said it best: “Nice people made the best Nazis. Or so I have been told. My mother was born in Munich in 1934, and spent her childhood in Nazi Germany surrounded by nice people who refused to make waves. When things got ugly, the people my mother lived alongside chose not to focus on ‘politics,’ instead busying themselves with happier things. They were lovely, kind people who turned their heads as their neighbors were dragged away.”
It turns out that niceness is a lesser virtue, shallow and selfish, where as true compassion and kindness are deep. While the dominant goal of niceness is to avoid conflict, the purpose of kindness is to actually help others. While niceness keeps a careful distance from the world’s problems, kindness gets its hands dirty. Unlike kindness, niceness is utterly useless in the face of real evil.
Take the example of punching Nazis, which recently threw liberal discourse into a frenzy. Punching Nazis is definitely not nice. But it is something more important than nice: useful. After alt-right (read: Neo-Nazi) leader Richard Spencer got punched on live TV, he stated that he was now wary of leaving his house for fear of a repeat occurrence. Punch a Nazi, and he becomes a little more afraid of airing his disgusting views. 
If you don’t believe me, take it from Spencer himself: “We have to get serious about security…or we can’t have a public movement and without a public movement we can’t win.” Hitler himself expressed a similar sentiment:“Only one danger could have jeopardized [the rise of Nazi Germany]… if our adversaries… had from the first day annihilated with the utmost brutality the nucleus of our new movement.”
Nazis like Spencer want niceness. They want nice people to nod politely as they debate the merits of a “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” They want nice people not to call them out in interviews, and they definitely want interviews. The more traditional and far-reaching the news source, the better. They want to turn the most abhorrent brand of white supremacy into a pleasant, respectable topic of debate.
Punching Nazis, while not nice, cuts into their hopes of achieving all this. Yes, free speech is vital and must be protected now more than ever. However, there is a fundamental difference between allowing Nazis to speak without legal punishment and allowing Nazis to speak on NPR.  The former is a right granted to Americans with even the most revolting views. The latter brings those revolting views into the average American living room. The latter legitimizes Nazism, normalizes Nazism, and yes, advertises Nazism. Punching Nazis doesn’t deprive them of free speech, but it does push them and their “views” back into the shadows of deplorability – where they belong.
Like my family friend on Facebook, you may now want to quote Martin Luther King, Jr.: the liberal icon of pacifism. Martin Luther King, Jr. would never consider violence an acceptable political strategy. Martin Luther King would be nice. If you’re invoking MLK to invalidate militant anti-fascism, there’s a good chance MLK would place you in the category “white moderate.” He had some firm words for white moderates, and I will also urge all “nice” liberals to listen. 
“I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says “I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can’t agree with your methods of direct action,” wrote King in a 1963 letter from Birmingham Jail. “Shallow understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.”
I will never advocate violence, but I do believe that this nation, democracy, and the world are in crisis. I believe that Nazis and fascists will continue to take the T**** presidency as an opportunity to gain power. While liberals and white moderates are occupied trying to bring these people to the table of discussion and compromise, I believe they will continue to charge forward, trampling human rights — and human lives — in their wake. The stakes are too high for niceness. We all must take a bold stand and choose kindness — active and forceful kindness — instead.
If we want to prevent the worst-case scenario, all liberals should abandon “niceness” as a political stance. Instead of niceness, refuse Neo-Nazis the courtesy of a legitimate public platform. Instead of niceness, persuade those in your network to take full advantage of their democratic rights (protest, contact your representatives, express your dissent). Instead of niceness, choose instead to loudly and repeatedly reject all omens of fascism. Resist now. Not tomorrow, not at midterms, not when T****’s policies inevitably strike you personally, but now. Resist now and fascism won’t win.

Two weeks ago, much of the country was up in arms when White House senior advisor Kellyanne Conway spoke about “alternative facts” being used to describe the crowd size at President Trump’s inauguration. Her blatant acknowledgment of the inaccurate statements used and accepted by the Trump administration made the rest of the country wonder what else in Trump’s rhetoric had been made up. Now, some Twitter users are attempting to call out President Trump by tweeting factual statements about scientific and environmental issues.
These accounts, including @AltNatParkSer (“The Unofficial #Resistance team of the U.S. National Park Service”), @RogueNOAA (“Research on our climate, oceans, and marine life should be subjected to peer, not political, review”), and @NASAGoneRogue (“NASA Employees taking a stand”), have begun tweeting messages about atmospheric conditions, scientific theories, and climate change. Many of them have specifically called out President Trump, warning him and his administration about the dangers of ignoring climate change and other environmental issues.
These accounts popped up following an incident over the weekend of Trump’s inauguration in which the National Parks Service retweeted a message on their official Twitter account from The New York Times reporter Binyamin Appelbaum that negatively compared crowd sizes at Trump’s inauguration to Barack Obama’s. After seeing the retweet, the Trump administration asked the Interior Department to cease using Twitter for that weekend. The retweet has since been taken down, and the agency later reported that the Twitter ban came out of a concern that the account had been hacked, as the agency does not typically share crowd size estimates.
Following the temporary ban, the official Twitter account of Badlands National Park wrote several unauthorized tweets affirming climate change research. “Today, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is higher than at any time in the last 650,000 years. #climate” one tweet said, followed by “The pre-industrial concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 280 parts per million (ppm). As of December 2016, 404.93 ppm.” The tweets were later deleted, but the message was quickly taken up by the rogue Twitter user behind @AltNatParkSer, and the many other rogue accounts that followed suit.
On one hand, these rogue accounts are a fantastic example of the power of social media to allow for freedom of speech. It is no secret that the Trump administration does not believe in man-made climate change. President Trump’s nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, has said on record that the effect of humans on climate change is “subject to more debate.” He also had a major role in suing the Obama administration over its climate and environmental rules. Indeed, scientists across the country are worried that the new administration will not fight for solutions, or even recognize the problem. So where the official environmental agencies of the United States government aren’t allowed to step in and establish what the research the administration refuses to accept, it is good to have private citizens make people aware.
However, there is a danger in the rogue accounts that is similar to the danger that we faced during the election in regards to fake news sources. These Twitter accounts are essentially that — fake news sources. They are unverified accounts mimicking official government agencies with facts and statistics that, to the average person, seem credible. While it is true that anyone could look at the Twitter bio of these accounts to see that they are unofficial, a quick scroll through a news feed wouldn’t tell a Twitter user whether or not the account can be trusted.
These accounts are indicative of a larger issue­ — people are angry that the Trump administration seems to ignore what is proved science on the subject of climate change. The owners of these rogue accounts are aiming to educate the public. However, by marketing themselves as unofficial accounts of official organizations, they run the risk of being lumped in with the fake news sources from both the left and right that plagued the election season.
The fake accounts also play into the echo chamber issue that faces many social media users. Whereas the @AltNatlParkSer gathered 14,000 followers on Twitter, the people who choose to follow a clearly liberal account like this are more likely to be people whose beliefs line up with a liberal Twitter account. When we have accounts like these that saturate news feeds rather than people relying on official accounts and news sources, the conversation with the other side of the argument becomes more and more biased and further away from resolution.
It is wonderful that these facts are being put on the internet, for the public to see. However, it would be even better if these accounts could stand on their own, and not claim to be affiliated with government agencies in a way that will perpetuate the problem of fake news.
These are vital conversations to be having, especially as the environmental conditions of our country and our planet worsen exponentially. These conversations, however, need the backing of credible sources and verified facts. We can’t fight biased rhetoric with potentially biased rhetoric — we need to fight it with indisputable facts and hard evidence coming from trusted places.
For the Twitter users who come across these rogue tweets, I encourage you to read them, take them with a grain of salt, and use them as a springboard to research environmental issues with information from official agencies and news sources. Spread this vital information, but do it with solid facts from credible places.

Last week, President Donald Trump added his controversial chief strategist, Steve Bannon, to the Principals Committee of the National Security Council, the main advisory body within the White House that helps to plan and execute the president’s foreign policy. At the same time, the president removed the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence from the Principals Committee. This move, the latest in a series of mounting controversies surrounding Bannon, is outrageous and dangerous for three reasons. First, Bannon’s hateful and bigoted record makes him unfit to objectively advise the president on matters of national security and foreign policy. Second, Bannon lacks any experience or qualifications in foreign policy that would make him fit to serve in this capacity. Finally, Bannon’s explicitly political role within the Trump administration, coupled with the purging of apolitical officials like the Joint Chiefs, implies that Trump’s foreign policy decisions will be guided by political expedience, rather than national interest or security.
Bannon should not advise President Trump on issues of national security because his history of personal prejudice renders him incapable of making objective decisions in foreign affairs. Before joining Trump’s campaign, Bannon was the Chairman of Breitbart, a far-right political website with white-nationalist ties and a history of racist and sexist articles. Bannon also has his own history of making anti-immigrant, Islamophobic, anti-semitic, and misogynistic statements. Truthfully, these views make him unfit to serve in the White House in any capacity, because Bannon’s influential role within the Trump administration gives him a powerful national platform to push for regressive domestic policy changes that will harm immigrants, women, and religious and ethnic minorities in the United States.
But Bannon now has a platform from which he can export his extreme and dangerous ideology to the entire world. The president depends on the National Security Council to review the intelligence that the government gathers and to make decisions about how to protect the United States from foreign threats. This requires that members of the Principals Committee objectively assess the information they are provided, so the committee can create practical and well-grounded recommendations to the president. How can Bannon be trusted to objectively assess intelligence from a majority-Muslim nation given his well-documented history of anti-Muslim sentiment? Likewise, how can Bannon be trusted to provide level-headed council on Israel, when he criticized his daughters' school because of their Jewish classmates? Bannon’s worldview is clouded by prejudice, and that makes our nation less safe. 
Bannon has no experience in foreign policy or national security. It’s striking that the president chose to remove from the National Security Council some of the nation’s foremost experts on military strategy and intelligence, namely, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Experience. Each of these public servants has decades of experience in assessing threats to national security and helping to shape the nation’s foreign policy and military strategy. Some argue that Bannon’s past military service is experience enough. However, Bannon only served for seven years, and he left the Navy over thirty years ago. Moreover, he was an officer charged with executing military strategy, not a strategist helping to shape it. Bannon’s role on the National Security Council is one normally reserved for generals.
Trump’s decision to reorganize the National Security Council is unacceptable because it sends a clear message that the White House intends to politicize the nation’s approach to security. Bannon’s role in the White House is as its chief political strategist. In other words, it’s his task to shape the administration’s message and public image. While the political strategists of previous administrations, such as Karl Rove and David Axelrod, have been informed on the National Security Council’s deliberations, neither sat on the Principals Committee or shaped the actual policies it created. By removing apolitical actors like the Joint Chiefs and replacing them with Bannon, Trump clearly plans to put his political image over the nation’s security. Protecting national security, setting military strategy, and shaping foreign policy all require hard choices, including decisions that might be unpopular with the public, who don’t have access to the classified information that contours the realities of such situations. As chief political strategist, Bannon’s role isn’t to make tough, unpopular decisions, but, in fact, to do just the opposite. Trump has demonstrated that he intends to put political expedience over national security, and that is unacceptable. He must remove Bannon and reinstate the Joint Chiefs and the Director of National Intelligence.
While Congress doesn’t have the authority to remove Bannon from the White House entirely, they do have the power to reverse Trump’s decision regarding the National Security Council if he refuses to do so. Congress created the National Security Council with the 1947 National Security Act. That act designates several “statutory attendees” who are required by law to be included in its deliberations, including the Vice President, Secretary of State, and Secretary of Defense. Congress should amend the act to include the Joint Chiefs and the Director of National Intelligence as statutory attendees. In addition, Congress should amend the National Security Act to stipulate that no member of the president’s administration with an explicitly political role, such as the chief strategist, can be installed onto the Principals Committee. Steve Bannon, because of his prejudice, inexperience, and politicized role in the Trump Administration, makes the United States less safe. Congress must act to remove him from the National Security Council if Trump refuses to do it himself.
