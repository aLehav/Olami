Despite a sloppy beginning, the Carnegie Mellon football team was able to bounce back and defeat Allegheny College 26–7 in its home opener.
After a sluggish first quarter during which senior wide receiver Tim Swanson fumbled and senior quarterback Rob Kalkstein threw a red-zone interception, the Tartans got on the scoreboard early in the second quarter.
The Tartans’ scoring drive started at their 49-yard line with 12:49 remaining in the second quarter. On the first play, senior fullback Zachary Erra-Hernandez broke away for a fantastic 26-yard run. After a crucial 1-yard run by Rob Kalkstein on fourth-and-one, Erra-Hernandez capped the drive off with a 1-yard plunge, giving the Tartans a 7–0 lead.
The stout Tartan defense, led by seniors Jack Butler, Dallas Hartman, and Akwasi Brefo, kept the Gators off the scoreboard until a bizarre play at the end of the half.
The Gators started at their own 38-yard line with 37 seconds left in the half. After a 20-yard pass from quarterback Jon Nigro to wide receiver Andrew Niklaus and a 3-yard rush by Nick Diechler, the Gators had a chance for one final play with four seconds remaining.
Even though he was nearly sacked, Nigro scrambled out of the pocket and threw a Hail Mary pass into the end zone, where it was caught by Niklaus to tie the game 7–7 at halftime.
The play had the potential to change the momentum of the game, but the Tartans never let that happen. 
In the second half, they exploded with 19 more points and shut down the Gator offense.
“You just have to have a short memory in all sports, especially football. You never know, you can get a three-and-out, and come right back and score,” said Hartman. “Our offense was really good last year and we knew that they would stop turning over the ball eventually.”
The second half was led by Troy Witt. The sophomore running back rushed for two touchdowns, giving the Tartans a comfortable lead.
Witt made good use of the sidelines, most notably on a 13-yard touchdown run that gave the Tartans a 13–7 lead with seven minutes remaining in the third quarter.
“I got a few TDs, but that was all the linemen,” Witt said. “They open it for me and I am going to hit the holes and put it in the end zone.”
Erra-Hernandez was excellent up the middle, gaining a well-earned 89 yards rushing on 19 carries to go along with his second-quarter touchdown. The one-two punch of Witt and Erra-Hernandez gave the Gator defense all sorts of fits. Witt gained 103 yards rushing on 16 carries.
The Tartan football team next plays at Catholic College this Friday. Their next home game is homecoming on Sept. 28 against Geneva College.

After falling to Dickinson College in the final seconds of the game on Sept. 7, the men’s soccer team rallied back with a last-minute goal on Wednesday night against Geneva College.
In the 90th minute, senior Chris Wysocki headed a cross from first-year midfielder Tristan Lockwood into the side of the net for the only goal of the 1–0 game.
The play started when Lockwood sent a corner kick into a crowded Geneva penalty box. A Geneva defender headed it out to junior defender Mark Nicholas, who played the ball back to Lockwood on the wing.
“They were all looking at the ball go out wide, and I changed my run and was able to cut in front of the defenders. Tristan played a great ball in,” Wysocki said.
The Tartans, playing at home, were the faster and more composed team, dominating possession and creating goal-scoring opportunities.
Moments before his game-winning goal, Wysocki — after a give-and-go with senior forward Max Tassano — had a clear shot at goal from the left side of the penalty box, only for a Geneva defender to deflect it for a corner.
Tassano also had several opportunities to score. In the 70th minute, his goal off a free kick from senior defender Ben Bryant was waved offside.
Until Wysocki’s goal in the 90th minute, the theme of the night was missed chances.
Despite outshooting Geneva 16 to 11 and taking 17 corner kicks to Geneva’s six, the Tartans were unable to convert their chances, as their shots flew wide or soared above the crossbar.
“Our guys, for the most part, continue to create ample opportunities. Because we’re creating opportunities, the next step is obviously finishing them.... But it’s promising that we’re creating the chances,” said assistant coach Michael Piranian.
Averaging close to 19 shots per game, the Tartans have scored only one goal in each game.
“We’re clearly creating the opportunities, but not finishing them,” Wysocki said. “I’m sure the goals will come. We just got to keep working at it.”
The unsung hero of Wednesday’s game was senior keeper Christopher Madden, who finished with six saves.
In the 53rd minute, Madden made an instinct save on a Geneva shot from the left side of the box, deflecting the ball wide with his left hand.
“[He] did a good job of not only communicating with his backs, but with his goal kicks and punts that were giving us a chance to contest,” Piranian said.
“We’ve had four shutouts so far. [The goalkeepers] are a big part of that along with our back four,” Wysocki said.
Madden posted another shutout on Saturday, as the Tartans beat Allegheny College 1–0 on the road.
Tassano scored in the 34th minute off a pass from Wysocki, and the Tartans once again dominated the game, outshooting Allegheny 15–5. Only two of Allegheny’s shots were on goal.
The shutout continues the Tartans’ streak of 1–0 victories and improves their record to 5-1.
The Tartans will next play Washington & Jefferson College on the road this Wednesday at 7 p.m.

College football is in the midst of a dramatic change. 
Major conference realignment is finally coming to fruition with the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) adding the University of Pittsburgh and Syracuse University, and the Big 12 Conference adding West Virginia University and Texas Christian University while losing Texas A&M University to the Southeastern Conference.
Pitt’s move to the ACC was bittersweet. They had played in the Big East Conference since 1982 and were part of a legacy of excellence in both football and basketball. 
Unfortunately, the Big East started as a basketball conference, and many of its schools did not even have football teams. As time went on, this conflict of interest eventually led to all of the football schools leaving the conference, starting in 2004 when the University of Miami and Virginia Tech moved to the ACC.
Because of Big East football’s decline in recent years, Pitt’s move to the ACC has been rough. Their ACC debut came on Labor Day against Florida State University. 
Unfortunately for Pitt, this was also the debut of redshirt Florida State first-year quarterback Jameis Winston. Winston threw for four touchdowns and added another rushing score, demolishing the Panthers defense with 381 total yards. 
Pittsburgh quarterback Tom Savage had a mediocre game with one touchdown to two interceptions and a barely 50 percent completion percentage.
This season also marks the final year of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). Currently, the two teams chosen for the national championship game are based on the BCS rankings, a weighted compilation of the Associated Press Poll, the USA Today Coaches Poll, and six computer rankings. 
These computer rankings have always caused controversy. The algorithms that determine the rankings are not made public and use different criteria in ranking teams.
While the national championship teams may have been controversial in the past, the defending national champions have silenced all doubters. The University of Alabama has won three of the last four national championship games. 
This past Saturday, they faced off against the Texas A&M Aggies led by Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel. Last year, Manziel became the first freshman to win the Heisman, cementing his campaign by handing Alabama their one and only loss of the season.
On Saturday, despite setting a school record for passing yards and scoring 42 points against the intimidating Alabama defense, Manziel was unable to repeat last season’s magic, and his Aggies fell to the Crimson Tide, 49–42.
Penn State is two years removed from the unpleasant ending of the Joe Paterno era and the Jerry Sandusky scandal. Coach Bill O’Brien has done a fantastic job keeping the Nittany Lions from spiraling into irrelevance. 
Unfortunately, there are still some growing pains as the program recovers from the major talent loss following the penalties doled out in the wake of the scandal. So far, Penn State is picking up where they left off after last year’s surprising 8–4 campaign. The Nittany Lions are 2–1 against all non-major conference schools. Their one loss came on Saturday against the University of Central Florida.
Despite the loss, Penn State showed their will to fight, overcoming an early 18-point deficit and bringing the game back to a more respectable 34–31 finish. Running back Zach Zwinak rushed for 128 yards and three touchdowns but hurt the Nittany Lion comeback efforts with a late fumble.
College football is going through a major transition period with conference realignment and a new championship-determining method. But one thing that hasn’t changed is the quality of football played every Saturday.

Apple made things simple by giving people a smartphone with one button. But imagine ditching the button and commanding a computer without any tactile controls. Imagine controlling a computer by moving your hands in front of a screen, and you’ll get the Leap Motion Controller by Leap Motion. Like a miniature version of the Microsoft’s Kinect, the controller allows users to twist, turn, pinch, and manipulate all sorts of visualizations with two hands and 10 fingers with no direct contact required.
The controller contains two cameras and three infrared LED sensors. With all of these working together, the controller can detect a user’s hands and fingers on three axes. It recognizes location, speed, and specific gestures like quickly drawing a circle in the air with your finger.
The device itself is incredibly small — about the size of a few sticks of gum — and is conveniently USB powered. Adding it to your workspace will only be an issue if you are already strapped for USB ports or have your desk space meticulously laid out. Otherwise, it is a completely unobtrusive device.
Installing the software is fairly straightforward and quick, and starts out with an orientation to the device. The orientation is the first interaction users have with the controller, and serves as a good way to introduce the device to friends.
It’s flashy and entertaining to see that hand motions above your computer affect particles onscreen, and to see wireframes of your fingers, hands, and wrist appear before you like something out of Tron or Iron Man. The precision is remarkable, and there is such a low latency (the time delay between performing an action and seeing its result onscreen) that it appears there is no delay between what you do and what you see on your computer.
Beyond the orientation experience, what’s available on Airspace — Leap Motion’s app store for software designed specifically for the motion controller — is currently lacking. This is to be expected for a relatively new device, as most of the apps are focused on the whimsy of motion control, not exploring the device’s full potential.
However, among the bounty of gimmicky apps are a few that demonstrate Leap Motion’s long-term potential. Molecules, a pre-installed app, allows users to view 3-D models of various molecules and chemicals. Users can rotate, scale, zoom, and pan around the various molecules with very intuitive and natural gestures. The accessibility is the selling point of this free app, which explores the capabilities the Leap Motion Controller has as an educational tool. There is a lot of potential for this technology to be used in classrooms across the world.
This potential can be skewered by poor control design, though. Another app, the already popular Google Earth, is pre-installed and given motion controls through the device. However, using the app is nearly impossible. As soon as it loads, poor hand placement can jettison Earth into a crazy spin that is difficult to stop. Additionally, actually navigating this 3-D globe is hard; every twist and turn the planet makes seems to be accidental, and never what the user intended to do with his or her hand placement. Luckily, most of the software available isn’t this difficult to control, but a poor control interface like this can ruin a user’s experience with an app, and with the Leap Motion.
The technology is impressive, but the current software available leaves something to be desired. However, this is a much better situation than having broken technology; better apps can and most likely will be made soon, utilizing the full potential of the Leap Motion Controller.

As evidenced by the outcry over the potential closing of the local bar Panther Hollow Inn last spring, Carnegie Mellon students love their beer. However, students here may not know how this refreshing drink is made and what gives it that smooth taste.
Beer is composed of four main ingredients: water, malt, hops, and yeast. The simplest explanation of the beer-making process is that the malt releases sugars into hot water, the yeast turns these sugars into alcohol, and the hops provide the bitter kick. But let’s go into more detail. What are the steps of brewing beer? In the book Beer Craft: A Simple Guide to Making Great Beer, William Bostwick and Jessi Rymill describe the process in six easy steps.
The first step is called mashing. This step is done the same way one might make a cup of tea, except instead of a small bag of tea leaves in a mug of hot water, a large mesh bag of grain (malt) is steeped in a stockpot of hot water. On John Palmer’s website “How To Brew,” he describes the malting process: “The debranching, beta-glucanase, and proteolytic enzymes do their work, preparing the starches for easy access and conversion to sugars.” Depending on the type of grain being used and what type of beer is being made, different grain-to-water ratios and different temperatures for the hot water are used. For example, Beer Advocate says that specialty dark malts are used in small quantities and produce stouts or bocks; roasted malts are used in mild and brown ales; and wheat malt, obviously, is a main component of wheat beers. The temperature of the water is dependent upon what temperature the enzymes in the particular malt being used perform the best at.
The second step is to sparge the wort — this is the sweet mixture left in the stockpot after the grains have been steeped for about an hour. In this step, the mesh bag of grain is removed, and the last of the wort drains into the stockpot. After the mesh bag has been drained, the grains must be rinsed in a fresh pot of hot water, then allowed to steep, and sparged again. This is to ensure the maximum wort is made from the grain. 
The third step is boiling the wort. This is where the hops or other spices are added to the mixture. Some examples of hops that are listed on the website freshops.com include Amarillo, Cascade, and Centennial, which are citrus-like spices used in India pale ales (IPAs), and the aromatic Hallertau and Liberty that are used in lagers and bocks. About.com discusses the importance of timing during this step. Hops break down as they are boiled, causing their flavor to evaporate and disappear. Consequently, the more hops that are added early on during the boil, the more bitter the beer will be.
The fourth phase is chilling. This step is crucial because yeast cannot operate at the temperature of the boiled wort. During the chilling process, chunks of protein settle out of the mixture, leaving the beer nice and smooth. 
When the wort is sufficiently chilled, the fifth step is funneling the wort into a fermenter, which is when brewers add the yeast to the brew and convert the sugars into alcohol and officially turn the mixture into beer. This occurs because the glucose enters in the yeast through diffusion and is broken down through glycolysis. This process results in pyruvates and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), according to howstuffworks.com
While the ATP is used to supply energy to the yeast, the pyruvates are converted by the yeast into carbon dioxide and ethanol — the alcohol. For the first day or two of fermentation, a blow-off tube should be attached to the opening of the fermenter to collect proteins, hop resins, and dead yeast cells. This tube is then replaced by an airtight cap, and the beer is left to ferment. This process takes approximately one week, although stronger beers require longer fermentation periods.
The sixth and final step is bottling. As in the case of transferring the wort from the pot to the fermenter, the transfer of beer from the fermenter to bottles must be done carefully with a tracking cane and tube to make sure no sediment gets into the bottles. After the bottles are filled and capped, they should be allowed to carbonate in a dark, cool spot for a week or two. The last test of patience comes after this, when the carbonated bottles must sit in the fridge for another week.
And with that, any student can ponder over the process and the science of brewing while enjoying a cold beer.

Europeans seek further proof for Martian life
The European Space Agency, in conjunction with Russian space agency Roscosmos, plans to launch a mission to Mars within the next decade. The ExoMars rover is planned to land on the surface in 2018 with the primary objective of detecting the presence of biological life that exists currently or may have in the past. The main tool being used is a model bacteria created to predict what microbial life could survive under the conditions of extreme radiation on Mars.
Evidence from previous rovers shows the presence of argon isotopes, a prevalent element in Earth’s atmosphere, in the atmosphere of Mars. This indicates that radiation once had much less of an effect on Mars. This atmosphere, however, is likely to have been ejected by the heavy solar wind which existed billions of years ago.

Researchers figure out how to implant memories in mice
Scientists at the University of California, Irvine’s neurological department believe they have found a method to create memories within the brains of mice. Norman Weinberger and his team played a specific tone while stimulating the release of a main neurotransmitter involved in memory formation. This increased the number of brain cells which responded to the tone. The next day, many sounds were played to the test mice, including the tone from the day before. When this tone played, the scientists noted an increase in the rate of breathing of the mice, suggesting that a memory had been created by direct manipulation of the brain.
“Disorders of learning and memory are a major issue facing many people ... our hope is that our research will pave the way to prevent or resolve this global issue,” Weinberger said

Gold may provide a new way to garner solar energy
Research at the University of Pennsylvania has led to a more efficient solar energy collector, using a cost effective form of gold. Dawn Bonnell, vice provost of research, leads the project that uses a layer of gold nanoparticles — along with a light sensitive molecule called porphyrin — to create plasmonic nanostructures. These plasmons absorb radiation and release a current of electrons through the gold particles, which enhances the scattering of light.
The technology is based on the structure and spacing of the nanoparticles of gold.   These can determine the appropriate wavelengths with which the plasmons react. “You could imagine having a paint on your laptop that acted like a solar cell to power it using only sunlight,” Bonnell said. This process is three to 10 times more effective than normal photoelectric methods

Geneticists look for genes that impact handedness
Researchers have learned more information about the genes of hand preference. William Brandler and colleagues at the University of Oxford examined 3,300 test subjects, to determine the strength of their right or left handedness. Among these subjects, there was one gene out of 100,000 which they had in common, called PCSK6. Brandler says “When we looked up what the gene actually does, it was a real eureka moment.”
The PCSK6 gene is related to the asymmetrical development of an organism. When this gene was altered in mice, their organs were flipped across their body, leaving their hearts on the right side. Although this gene plays a clear role in handedness, it is also known that environment is a factor in human development.

Testing determines  dinosaur DNA too old to sequence
In the ’90s, studies suggested that insects frozen in fossils contained their ancient DNA, similar to the scientific premise for director Steven Spielberg’s 1993 film Jurassic Park. However, studies at the University of Manchester conclude that this is not the case. Using a technique which should prevent any contaminant DNA from entering the test material, organisms found in amber were tested for the presence of DNA. The test organisms showed no potential for DNA to reside within the amber.
The technique used in previous experiments was unreliable for testing such ancient DNA. “Undamaged DNA molecules that contaminate an extract of partially degraded ancient ones give false positive results that might be mistaken for genuine ancient DNA,” Terry Brown of the University of Manchester said.

Voyager spacecraft may have finally left solar system
Data from probes on the Voyager 1 spacecraft potentially shows proof that the spacecraft has left the solar system. The data from Aug. 25, 2012 show that the density of particles has increased from 0.002 to 0.1 cubic centimeters, indicating that it is now in interstellar space. The spacecraft has traveled at about 60,000 kilometers per hour since 1977, and is now 18.2 billion kilometers from the Sun.
Some, however, believe that this change in density is not yet enough proof, since the Voyager 1 lacks a functional plasma detecting instrument. George Gloeckler from University of Michigan believes we should wait another two or three years for Voyager 2 to reach this distance. “Voyager 2 will experimentally answer this question. Why rush to conclusions now?” Gloeckler said.

Walking around Pittsburgh’s North Side 35 years ago was a completely different experience than it is today; back then, the area was still segregated and rife with crime and drug activity.
Not so much today. Now safe and host to a diverse artistic community, the North Side has gone through significant changes in recent decades. Some of that change is thanks to the establishment and growth of the Mattress Factory, a contemporary art museum focused on site-specific installation work that dates back to 1975.
The Mattress Factory, located at 500 Sampsonia Way, began its 35th-anniversary celebration in February with a series of community parties. The festivities continue this month with the opening of two new exhibits: Detroit: Artists in Residence, and Within, an exhibit by New York City-based contemporary artist Janine Antoni.
History and Growth of the Mattress Factory
When Barbara Luderowski, a sculptor and architecture enthusiast, saw an empty mattress warehouse on Pittsburgh’s North Side in 1975, she saw the potential for a brighter future for the area. Luderowski bought the building that year for $10,000 and created a space for artists and intellectuals to live and work as a community — and thus launched the Mattress Factory.
In 1977, the organization became a nonprofit corporation, and five years later premiered its first exhibition of installation art. Since then, the museum has exhibited the work of over 600 artists from around the world and is currently home to 17 permanent installations, including creations of American light and space artist James Turrell, Japanese installation artist Yayoi Kusama, American sculptor Greer Lankton, British sculptor Bill Woodrow, and American painter William Anastasi.
The Mattress Factory has a history of embracing change and encouraging engagement with technology, museum patrons, and the surrounding community.
The museum has been an early adopter of innovative technologies. In 2009, it became the first museum in the U.S. to use QR codes to engage visitors with more information about the exhibits while reducing waste from printed materials. It also has a Facebook page and a Twitter account.
The Mattress Factory has worked hard to become a well-respected institution in the surrounding neighborhood. “Having the Mattress Factory here in a residential neighborhood has been a big catalyst for change,” said Alexis Tragos, the museum’s director of development. Since its opening, the museum has acquired and renovated two other buildings for exhibitions and others for educational spaces and artist residences, bringing jobs to the neighborhood and encouraging even more people to visit. “We are a magnet for people who are traveling from outside of Pittsburgh to come and visit,” Tragos said. “It’s a very unique attraction.”
Despite these many changes, however, the museum has sought to remain close to the history of the neighborhood. With each renovation, the museum has chosen to keep the previous building’s façade in order to blend with existing architecture. Even when artists want to change the structure of a building — Sarah Oppenheimer’s piece “610-3356” created an opening in the fourth floor of the gallery that gives visitors a direct line of sight out of a third-floor wall and into a neighboring yard — the Mattress Factory has kept at least part of the original appearance in place.
Installations of extreme proportions, such as Oppenheimer’s work, are not often encouraged by museums, but this type of experimentalism is at the core of what the Mattress Factory does. Since its establishment, the Mattress Factory has presented itself as a place where artists are encouraged to pursue ideas that may originally seem impossible. “When an artist has a big idea, we make it happen,” Tragos said.
Detroit: Artists in Residence
The main museum building houses the first of the two exhibits that opened last Thursday. Detroit: Artists in Residence features recent work by four artists and two collaborations, all based in Detroit. According to a museum press release, the artists were chosen after a trip to the city that inspired museum co-directors Luderowski and Michael Olijnyk.
“The artists’ reactions to the swift socioeconomic changes in Detroit, and their making of work in an environment burgeoning with opportunity, align with the Mattress Factory’s mission of encouraging artists to experiment and take risks,” the press release said. “Such edgy creativity and entrepreneurship remind Luderowski and Olijnyk of the same spirit at play during the founding of the Mattress Factory on Pittsburgh’s North Side 35 years ago.”
Indeed, the six works that comprise the exhibit show tremendous variety and creativity, often incorporating external elements and city-specific cues.
One of the artists whose work is displayed here, Jessica Frelinghuysen, built her entire piece out of such external elements. In her work “My City is Your City,” Frelinghuysen examines personal and shared experiences in close communities through an audio and visual representation of her life in Hamtramck, Mich., a two-square-mile city almost entirely surrounded by the city of Detroit.
The installation is a room full of tree-like structures built from alley wood and tin cans. Hold a can up to your ear, and you hear a sound — people talking about their heritage or life story, the sound of trains going by, clips from a live music performance — that Frelinghuysen collected from the area.
Frelinghuysen’s piece also includes the uniform she wore while collecting these sounds: a backpack with her audio recording equipment and a bright blue jumpsuit complete with a pierogi-warming pocket. The piece encourages visitors to listen to these people’s voices in order to better relate to a small community and the sounds that surround them every day.
Wandering into the next room, visitors are presented with the façade of a house, complete with two doors and a few exterior lights. From behind the doors, hammers, electric saws, and even human screams can be heard. A visitor who enters through one of the doors finds themselves in the midst of Nicola Kuperus and Adam Lee Miller’s psychological game: a piece titled “Diptyching.”
The room features a full-wall projection of a video of Kuperus and Miller, which shows the artists as they build the façade, watch it fall, and then take it apart. The video was made in the museum, and the artists rebuilt the piece after the filming with the video aspect built in.
According to the press release, the installation is “intended to be a visceral, confusing, and destabilizing experience,” and it absolutely is. The video is part comedy — complete with campy splashes of obviously fake blood — and part meaningful performance, where the repetition of scenes and sounds creates a truly disorienting environment. Watching the builders experience “injuries” in the building process is funny until the incessant barrage of these images starts to hurt. With this piece, Kuperus and Miller create a surreal world that is both comedic and grotesque, as funny as it is painful.
This unsettling, fun-house feeling continues throughout the exhibit. Another room features “1913 Revisited in Three Parts,” a piece by Frank Pahl that takes the visitor back in time to a world of mechanical devices and complex instruments. The installation is peaceful and nostalgic, but can feel very surreal. Changing lights cast odd shadows across the machines, and the room’s soundtrack distorts the visitor’s sense of time. Without being overly stylized, the piece — through both its title and actual construction — creates an environment for the viewer to meditate on the passing of time.
In the museum’s basement is one of the most surprising and confusing pieces of the Detroit exhibit: Scott Hocking’s “Coronal Mass Ejection.” This piece features a replica of a rusted 35-foot-long hot metal train car (called a torpedo or submarine car) surrounded by sculptures in various stages of worship, some human and some featuring dinosaur-like add-ons to their heads.
The piece is partially “about worshipping things beyond our understanding,” Hocking said. The mysteriousness of the industrial artifact combined with the religious aspect of its worshippers leads to questions about various mythologies and creation amd destruction myths. “This came from me thinking about how our artifacts will be interpreted in the future when they’re found by others,” Hocking said. “There’s mystery involved in religion, in archeology, and in science.”
The exhibit also features pieces by Russ Orlando, as well as a collaboration between Gina Reichert and Mitch Cope. “Cured,” Orlando’s piece, “explores the notion of healing a city, preserving what has defined it, slowing down time, making things last,” according to the gallery guide. It explores a butcher’s practice of curing, but instead of meats, metal car parts hang from chains and meat hooks suspended from the ceiling. The metals are covered in salt and are displayed in various stages of preservation and deconstruction.
Reichert and Cope’s piece, titled “Following The Sun 2,” is an installation encouraging research and reflection on environmental influences. Visitors can directly observe real-time wind and solar activity through carefully placed warming rocks, video screens, and other natural elements, with a focus on the use of direct current electricity.
Detroit is well suited for the 35th anniversary of the museum, as its displays encourage a high level of visitor participation and artistic creativity. These six pieces explore six completely different settings and ideas, but the underlying themes of the city itself have informed each work and thereby allow for a unified exhibit.

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times — and now it’s Redwood Time.
Last week marked the launch of Redwood Time, a YouTube comedy series produced by Carter Redwood, a senior acting major; Jamar Thrasher, a master’s student in Heinz College; and Clarence Williams IV, a junior directing major. Written and filmed during the past few months at Carnegie Mellon, Redwood Time is a comedic dramatization of Redwood’s life as an acting major.
The first episode is already on YouTube and features Carter’s encounters with a crazy “girlfriend” who doesn’t seem to notice that Carter is not all that into her.
Much of the series production is Carnegie Mellon-based. Many of the actors in the series are Carnegie Mellon students, and the theme song was written and performed by senior business administration major Kai Roberts. Redwood, Thrasher, and Williams also worked with Jordan Beckman, a local Pittsburgh videographer who has directed videos for Wiz Khalifa and Mac Miller.
The series has been well promoted on social media under #RedwoodTime, and its creators held a showing on Sept. 8 in McConomy Auditorium to a large audience. The teaser for the series has already accumulated over 900 views in one week.
Redwood, who is currently studying abroad at Drama Centre London, talked about why he and his partners decided to start a YouTube series: “It started as a way for myself and some of my partners to push our creative energy and ideas. The funny thing is, it wasn’t even my idea to make it about me. I was working with Jamar Thrasher and Clarence Williams IV, and we sat down and came up with the idea to make a web series as a precursor to a later film that we planned to make in the summer of 2014. So we said in order to build a fan base and get our names out, we thought that a web series would be a good way to get people to know about us and get our creative work out there prior to the film.”
He also spoke about the ideas and inspiration behind the series: “Our inspiration for it was ‘90s sitcoms, including The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Martin, Seinfeld, and Curb Your Enthusiasm. We created this character Carter Redwood in this world, and we created the Redwood Time universe as well as other characters in his life.”
“It’s based on my true life as an actor,” he said. “Carter, like me, is in school, trying to pursue a career as an actor, to make it from Pittsburgh to Hollywood, but we also created fictional situations and characters that are in his world.”
When asked about his favorite things about the series, Redwood replied, “I think it’s fun that stories that happened in my life can be turned into these over-the-top stories, that they can make people laugh, that Clarence’s words and Clarence’s writing can heighten it and give it that extra oomph to make people engaged in it. The stories and foundations come from a real place; the character Carter deals with things that I dealt with in real life.”
Redwood also discussed the creative process of writing the web series: “As an artist, there is nothing like creating your own work. I feel, as an actor, people are constantly trying to impress other people in auditions. There are so many people vying for one role, and as an artist it gives you a sense of freedom to say, ‘I can create my own rules for myself. I can collaborate with a team of creative teams and artists, and we can create something of our own to give ourselves that freedom to make our own work and our own art.’ ”
“I’m interested to see what happens next, if people tune in, how this will continue to grow, how it will expand,” he said. “We had the idea, and it’s satisfying to know that we got it out there on the web. We’ve been successful no matter how many people watched.”

If you see somebody screaming something like “JTCHOK-CHOK-CHOK-CHOKTA!” with an accompanying dance in the next few weeks, don’t worry. Chances are they’re emulating the musical stylings of the Norwegian musical cabaret act known as Ylvis, rather than indulging in something that’s illegal in the state of Pennsylvania. 
Ylvis is composed of brothers Bård and Vegard Ylvisåker, who have performed in Norway since 2000 and have since achieved some level of fame in Europe. They currently have a show on the Norwegian TV channel TVNorge, which is responsible for funding the big-budget music video for their single “The Fox,” in which the brothers sing about the ethereal beauty of foxes and scream nonsensical “fox noises” at the tops of their lungs.
It is probably best to become familiar with this video, because it is rapidly gaining popularity to the point that incessant references, repostings, and a number of unfunny covers and parodies are inevitable. 
Is it the next "Gangnam Style"? Most likely not. The heir to the "Harlem Shake" crown? Luckily, it's doubtful that the video will become that ubiquitous. It’s a shame that Ylvis is probably going to be remembered for giving the world a single clever video, which will then devolve into irritating repetition, because the rest of their work that has been translated into English is top-shelf comedy.
The songs “Pressure” and “Work It” both poke fun at the upscale hip-hop scene. “Work It” is an explicit song whose humor comes from a complete lack of sexiness. While one brother lays down the innuendo, the other explains the actual meaning of his every phrase and provides anatomical information and the specs for their hot tub. “Pressure” sees the brothers laying down the law about the need for proper amounts of pressure to be applied in situations ranging from popping balloons to negotiating a peace treaty in the Middle East.
Speaking of the Middle East, there's also “Jan Egeland,” a Bruce Springsteen-style power ballad about the “United Nations Super Hero Man,” whose peacekeeping efforts are known in the U.S. only to the most avid readers of news. In another song, “Stonehenge,” one member of the duo is so obsessed with the mysteries of the titular artifact that intimate moments with his wife are filled with expletive-laden musings on its origins.
The crown jewel of their work — unless you know either Norwegian or Russian, in which case “Janym” might be glorious — is “Someone Like Me.” It starts out as a traditional love song straight out of a Disney musical, only to suddenly become something else entirely that still manages to be heartwarming. Kinda.
So, if you have a thing for clever songs or Norwegian comedy, definitely track down the Ylvis playlist on the official TVNorge YouTube channel.

There are those games from your childhood that you play, have fun with, and then never pick up again. And then there are those games that stick with you for your entire life, altering the way you play and perceive video games and perhaps your life itself.
Kingdom Hearts is one of those games. Originally released in 2002, it was re-released this past week, along with Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories and Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days, in a high-defintion compilation dubbed Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix.
Kingdom Hearts is widely considered one of the best action RPGs out there, and one of the first to get the formula right. It follows the story of a young, impossibly optimistic boy named Sora and his lost friends, Riku and Kairi. In his travels, Sora encounters many characters from the Disney and Square Enix universes (the distributor and developer of the game, respectively), both familiar and not-so-familiar, while battling enemies unique to the series known as the Heartless.
Sora travels to worlds based on a handful of Disney movies — Tarzan, Alice in Wonderland, and Hercules, to name a few. The combat involves a lot of button-mashing, but there is some skill required. Sora does not always fight alone, though; he is joined by Donald Duck and Goofy both in combat and through most of the game. In almost all of the worlds, Sora gets a new companion unique to that world — usually the main character from the movie the world is based upon.
Even with the backing of these characters, though, it is a difficult game at times — something I am happy to admit. In fact, having beaten Kingdom Hearts more than a handful of times, I still had trouble not dying in the early hours of the game. The platforming has remained steadfastly frustrating at times, but feels a bit more forgiving now — though perhaps it’s just the bigger screen. The non-linearity of the game is surprisingly hard to get past sometimes as well, but it leads to a more rewarding explorative experience.
This is not the original Kingdom Hearts you loved and grew up with. It is the “final mix” — a re-release that, until last Tuesday, only existed in Japan. The changes from the original are mostly cosmetic — many enemies are now recolored to brighter versions of their previous selves — though there are some items and enemies thrown in for additional rewards and challenges, as well as a particularly notorious boss battle.
Also, the remastered visuals and audio look and sound incredible. While it is clear at times that certain textures are taken straight from the original, without much touching up, the character models look as good as you remember the PlayStation 2 ones looking.
Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories, the direct sequel to Kingdom Hearts, has been updated in similar ways, though the game itself has not changed much from its PlayStation 2 incarnation, which itself was actually a reincarnation of a GameBoy Advance game. The game’s combat system is a complete departure from the original, using cards to decide Sora’s moves instead of an on-screen attack menu. The scope of the game is also slightly more limited: Although Sora visits different worlds, they are all the same ones as he visited in the first game, and everything takes place inside a single castle.
However, the sequel offers you the chance to play as the somewhat enigmatic Riku and his inner battle with his obsession of power and evil. That said, the story takes a much darker turn from the original game, as both Riku and Sora take up arms against a new group of antagonists known as the Organization. This is the first game to include the deaths of characters, too.
The most interesting re-release in the set, however, is Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days. Originally released for the Nintendo DS in 2009, it is now presented in this collection as almost three hours of video footage, completely remastered from the original game. It presents side-stories and back-stories to many of the characters that appear both in Chain of Memories and Kingdom Hearts 2. And it must be said that the tale in cinematic format is just as heart-wrenching (though some would say cliché) as it was as a game.
What started out as pure conjecture — the idea of making a Disney game that could rival Nintendo’s Mario games in popularity — has ended up a hallmark game of a hallmark series. These games have not changed much since their initial release, and picking up the control still brings you right back to your couch all those years ago. It still evokes the same senses of wonder, mystery, and fascination as it did when we were kids.

We saw a lot of great new music this summer — Daft Punk’s Random Access Memories, Queens of the Stone Age’s ...Like Clockwork, and Kanye West’s Yeezus — but there’s a lot more just around the corner that’s worth getting excited about. So grab your pumpkin spice latte, put on your sweater, and settle in for this fall music preview.
MGMT - MGMT
Release date: Sept. 17
MGMT won everyone over in 2008 with their debut album Oracular Spectacular, which spawned the hits “Time To Pretend,” “Kids,” and “Electric Feel” and introduced mainstream music to psychedelic pop. With their follow-up, Congratulations, MGMT decided to challenge their listeners with meandering electric soundscapes and a lack of catchy melodies. With this upcoming third album, MGMT is staying true to that course. 
Lead single “Your Life Is A Lie” is rough around the edges in terms of production and features a cacophony of different noises blending into a collage of sound. Though it seems that MGMT will never go back to the kind of music they put out five years ago, I’m anxiously awaiting to see what new twists and turns they have in store for us.
Arcade Fire - Reflektor
Release date: Oct. 29
Arcade Fire is a band with a firm belief in quality over quantity. Over the past 10 years, it has released only three full-length albums, all of which have become modern classics (2004’s Funeral, 2007’s Neon Bible, and 2010’s The Suburbs).
According to Pitchfork.com, details regarding its upcoming fourth album are scarce, beyond talk of supposed help from David Bowie and James Murphy (of LCD Soundsystem). The first single, “Reflektor,” shows influence of disco as well as old prog-rock vinyls from the band’s childhood. So far, Arcade Fire hasn’t released an album that isn’t fantastic, and each one actually surpasses the one before it. If the band’s current album trajectory holds true, this release should be one of the best of the year.
Eminem - The Marshall Mathers LP II
Release date: Nov. 5
Deep down in his heart of hearts, Eminem wishes it could be 2002 forever. Back in the day, he was the most dangerous man in America, shattering the innocence of a generation of fourth-graders who didn’t understand intercourse because they didn’t have the Discovery Channel.
Today, though, he’s a big boring story of redemption, a man who makes music that both mother and daughter can agree with (“Love The Way You Lie,” etc.). Evidently this doesn’t sit well with the rapper-songwriter, so he’s decided to bleach his hair once again and provide a follow-up to his high water mark, The Marshall Mathers LP.
Based on the lead single, “Berzerk,” one can expect a Relapse-level attempt at trying to still be cool, but it’ll feel just a bit more pathetic this time. I’m just hoping he includes a “Kim II,” because Eminem always sounds genuine when rapping about killing his ex-wife.
Cults - Static
Release date: Oct. 15
Anyone who remembers that catchy “Go Outside” song from a couple of years ago — and a lot of people should, because it was in about a million commercials — knows Cults. However, many of these people may not have listened to its entire debut album. If they did, they would’ve known that Cults are much more than a one-song band.
Based on lead single “I Can Hardly Make You Mine”, it appears Cults aren’t shying away from digging a little deeper and making music that sounds darker, while still retaining their poppy gleam. I look forward to hearing what they’ve come up with; their debut showed a band with a lot of promise, and hopefully they continue expanding their sound rather than getting caught up in trying to replicate the success of “Go Outside.”
Danny Brown - Old
Release date: Sept. 30
Danny Brown is ridiculous and fun; anyone looking for some light-hearted, graphic misogyny should just listen to his collaboration with trap producers Flosstradamus, “From The Back.” He established his reputation in 2011 with the independently released XXX, but with his major-label debut on the horizon (Brown is signed to A-Trak’s Fool’s Gold label), he’s determined to make it clear that he’s here to stay.
According to Pitchfork.com, there’s a long list of collaborators reported to appear, including Schoolboy Q, Ab-Soul, and Charli XCX. Brown’s song with A$AP Rocky, “Kush Coma,” has already been released and will also appear on the album. From the first listen it’s abundantly clear that Old will be on repeat in foggy Honda Civics for years to come.
Kings of Leon - Mechanical Bull
Release date: Sept. 24
Alright, a quick disclaimer: I’m a huge fan of the first two, heavily southern-rock influenced Kings of Leon albums, Youth & Young Manhood and Aha Shake Heartbreak. But beginning with 2007’s Because of the Times, there has been a steady decline in the quality of the band’s output as it stray furthers and further from its garage-rock beginnings.
If lead single “Supersoaker” is any indication, however, the Kings have traded in the champagne for Miller Lite and are having fun again. Singer Caleb Followill’s voice once again has that Southern drawl that got lost in the high-end production of their last two albums, and Matt Followill goes back to the jangly lead parts we came to love in “Taper Jean Girl” and “The Bucket.” Hopefully Kings of Leon don’t disappoint with this one, for it could mean a renewal for a band that looked like it had run its course.

Warning: This article contains spoilers for the first and second seasons of New Girl.
Fans of Zooey Deschanel know that the popular and — according to FOX — “adorkable” TV show New Girl will resume with its third season this Tuesday at 9 p.m. The second season finale left us with Cece’s (Hannah Simone) three-hour traditional Indian wedding, during which she left her fiancé Shivrang (Satya Bhabha) and acknowledged her feelings for Schmidt (Max Greenfield). Unfortunately for Cece, Schmidt had renewed his relationship with Elizabeth (Merritt Wever), his college girlfriend, after he and Cece broke up. Confronted by the choice between Cece and Elizabeth, Schmidt literally ran away.
Meanwhile, Jess (Deschanel) and Nick (Jake Johnson) flounder at the possibility of having something more than friendship, and Winston (Lamorne Morris)... well, Winston provides comic relief.
This drama leads to two main questions that FOX has indicated will be answered during the upcoming season: Who will Schmidt pick? And will Nick and Jess become a real couple? On its website, FOX has also revealed that “Winston will get serious about taking control of his own love life,” hinting that he might finally get his own storyline.
Returning guest stars include Brenda Song, who played Winston’s girlfriend Daisy in the past season, as well as Damon Wayans Jr., known on the show as Coach. He left after the show’s pilot episode to star in the show Happy Endings, but he returns to New Girl following the cancellation of Happy Endings.
In an interview with tvline.com, Morris indicated that Daisy will appear in only one episode, confirming suspicions that Winston and Daisy will break up. Coach is rumored to be in at least four episodes this season. New guest stars include Angela Kinsey from The Office, Eva Amurri from Californication, and Dreama Walker from Don’t Trust the B---- in Apartment 23. The three are set to play a clique of “mean girl” teachers at the new school where Jess will begin working in the second episode of season three. This episode, titled “Jacooz” will feature Jess seeking Nick’s advice on how to fit in with the “cool” teachers, Schmidt at an office party gone wrong, and Winston suspecting Daisy of cheating on him.
What about the first episode? The promo video shows Jess and Nick crossing the border into Mexico and getting in trouble there, while Schmidt tells both Elizabeth and Cece separately that he’d like to be with them. It has the potential to be funny, but if the writers have only planned the third season to focus on lingering problems from the second, it can quickly become bland. Jess and Nick can only be an awkward couple for so long. This leads to the question of what would happen if their relationship does, in fact, work out.
Some of the most entertaining episodes in the past have centered on Jess’s love life, ranging from the time she has to pick up her things from ex-boyfriend Spencer’s house to when she tries to prepare a Thanksgiving meal for fellow teacher Paul, whom she had been dating. Nick and Jess’s relationship has been moving quite slowly so far, and the writers need to change things up. The same goes with Schmidt’s relationships. Though the show might still be funny, the writers need to vary the storylines to make sure that it remains interesting.

Dear New Patrick,
My roommate hasn’t showered or done his laundry in what seems like forever. It smells so bad up in here! My tree even died because it reeks! PLEASE HELP!
Sincerely,
Odious Housemate Gathers Olfactory Demons, Makes Yucky Stench, Environment Nearly Saturated, Ended Sycamore
Dear OH GOD MY SENSES,
Have you confronted your roommate with this problem? If you haven’t, chances are he’s not even aware that his habits bother you; it could just be the way he was raised (and after all, Carnegie Mellon is not exactly known for its hygienic student body).
On the other hand, if you do talk to him and he is obstinate, there is a solution. While he’s out, take all of his laundry and put it in a bathtub (or large bucket) along with an entire bottle of detergent and/or bleach (you may want to use a hazmat suit for this, and don’t be afraid to incinerate anything that appears to have attained sentience). And when he gets back, ambush him with a garden hose and water balloons filled with soapy water. Hopefully he’ll get the picture; you’ll have a clean roommate, and you’ll have worked out some of your aggression toward him.
May the Tide be with you,
Ryan Black & Matt Baron
Dear New Patrick(s??),
My RA advised us to go to the job fair this week, so I worked on my résumé all weekend, and I think my high school experiences will definitely land me a job at Facebook. One problem: I don’t know how to tie a tie. Can you help me?
Sincerely,
Wondering If Never Done Searching Occupation Readings, Knowing Not Of Ties
Dear WINDSOR KNOT,
In my experience, a job interview is all about the first impression, and I always strive to dress for the job I want, which is why I wear a snorkel and flippers everywhere. As for learning to tie a tie, I’m sure you can ask around. Your RA may be willing to tie one for you, or ask another floormate. Worse comes to worst, you can pull a Patrick Jane and wear a three-piece suit without a tie.
I wouldn’t be too sure that your high school projects will land you a job at Facebook. Companies tend to value work at the collegiate level as a more valid representation of skill. After the first semester, most résumés don’t even mention what high school they attended.
Just don’t wear one of those suit pattern T-shirts and you’ll be okay,
New Patricks

Star Trek
An incredible revival of the classic series, Star Trek captures all the wonder and endless entertainment of Starfleet. Film juggernaut J.J. Abrams manages to create an entertaining prequel without banking on nostalgia. Chris Pine and Carnegie Mellon alumnus Zachary Quinto ground the story with humanity and friendship despite their contrasting personas as Captain Kirk and Spock.
Star Trek: Into Darkness
The Enterprise is back and better than ever. With J.J. Abrams back to lead this ship, Into Darkness is a surprisingly fresh sequel that not only avoids the traps most franchises fall into but surpasses other summer blockbusters with ridiculous thrill rides and an amazing cast. Benedict Cumberbatch roars as the antagonist but also boldly makes us question the definition of a terrorist.  
Lawrence of Arabia
Lawrence of Arabia is a masterful landmark of filmmaking history. The story ventures out into the Middle Eastern front during World War I as seen through the eyes of T.E. Lawrence, who battles with both the world he sees and with his own identity. Full of glorious landscapes and fueled by a powerful story, Lawrence of Arabia mercilessly begets majesty. With his piercing blue eyes, Peter O’Toole offers one of the most compelling performances in the role that made him a star.

The Carnegie Mellon administration hopes to develop the University Center into the space facing Forbes Avenue within the next three years, with additions including an exercise area for strength training, cardio exercise rooms, a cycling studio, and a multipurpose exercise studio.
A town hall presentation was held by the University and Cannon Design on Wednesday in Rangos 3 to discuss Carnegie Mellon’s future University Center, part of the University’s 10-year master plan to expand and renovate its facilities. 
Students and faculty attended the meeting, looking to learn more about the project and voice their concerns and opinions.
According to Associate Director of Athletics Josh Centor, the athletics portion of the master plan has three phases. 
The first phase has already been completed with the installation of new turf on the soccer fields a few years ago. “It has more than doubled occupancy,” he said while complimenting the new fields. 
The second phase is still in progress; the third phase will focus on renovations to Skibo Gym.
Wednesday’s town hall meeting focused on the second phase, which Centor describes as “meeting the needs of the campus community in the realm of fitness and athletics” in the future University Center. According to the current plan, the renovations will change the dynamics of campus by shifting the center of the Pittsburgh campus. 
The new addition is expected to include a new fitness center and studio theaters, as well as shelf space in the University Center basement.
Ralph Horgan, associate vice provost of campus design and facility development, noted that the meeting “is not the final product. We want to hear from everybody.” 
Centor said that the project showed a “commitment to student experience.”
The first level of the University Center addition will feature heavy and light free weights, strength training, service desk, locker rooms, and a meeting room.
Centor was a strong advocate for a better weight room. “Right now, our weight area is at the very back end. If you want to do serious strength training, you can’t do it.” The facility on the first floor will therefore have newer, heavier weights and machinery.
The first floor will also house a new studio theater.  Elizabeth Vaughan, director of student activities, said that the studio theater would be multifunctional, to be used for dance rehearsals and performances, music concerts, and small theater productions. “We’re bursting at the seams in terms of rehearsal space,” Vaughan noted regarding the problems currently faced by many dance teams and performance groups at the university.
“We’re helping to address some of the theater needs of organizations like Scotch’n’Soda,” she added. The studio theater would have dance-quality flooring along with lighting systems and a sound system that Vaughan hopes will be easy for people to understand and use.
The second level of the University Center addition will have another fitness area on top of the fitness space to be built on the first floor, this one with cardio equipment. The fitness center will be an upgrade over the current space for such equipment.
Along with being a cardio workout area, the floor will have large- and medium-sized exercise studios and a cycling studio. 
With interest in physical education classes also at a high, Centor claimed, a new fitness center with such space would be beneficial.
“Now we’ll have three spaces every day where we teach these classes. The first and second floors of the fitness center will be connected, with individuals being comfortable working out on both floors,” Centor said.
Horgan hopes there will be “a sizable amount of space in this building” with more windows that let sunlight into the building. He also mentioned possible ideas to make the new University Center more aesthetically pleasing, such as a garden, rock walls covered in plants, and maybe even a small fountain.
The meeting revealed that a schematic design is currently being developed. The hope is for a complete design to be finalized at the beginning of 2014, with construction starting in spring 2014 and finishing at the beginning of the 2015–16 academic year. Presenters encouraged guests to view a current model they have of the building.
Various individuals asked questions at the town hall about the future building, with an emphasis on the new studio theater.
Andrew Schwartz, a junior information systems major, asked if there would be a stage in the rehearsal space; he was told that while there would not be a stage built into the space, there was also a fairly minimal need for such a stage.
Students and faculty raised other feedback, including the recommendation of including a visible sign that would welcome people to campus, and the potential problem of having too much sunshine from the building’s many windows.
While many students are excited about the addition, some wonder if a new fitness center facility is needed. When asked if he felt the Skibo Gym or University Center facilities need an upgrade, Aditya Dargan, a sophomore business administration major, replied, “No, they don’t.”
More information about the plans for expanding the University Center can be found at http://www.cmu.edu/cdfd/master-plan/.

Advances in neuroscience and computational learning developed in the basement of Wean Hall will be featured in the second episode of the PBS series “Brains on Trial with Alan Alda,” which airs this Wednesday.
The episode, narrated by actor and science advocate Alan Alda, features collaborative research among Carnegie Mellon University’s professor of psychology Marcel Just of the Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging, chair of the machine learning department Tom Mitchell, and assistant professor of social and decision sciences Karim Kassam. Just, Mitchell, and Kassam’s research revealed unexpected similarities among people’s neural representations of concrete objects and specific emotions. Just and his colleagues had method actors from Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Drama internalize specific emotions under an fMRI scanner. From these scans, researchers developed a computer-generated algorithm to identify emotions that actors were portraying.
“It turns out there is an enormous commonality across people. This was never known before — that our neural representations of objects, of emotions — of other things, are common. Our brains all use the same code,” Just said.
“One of the most amazing facets of this research is that when you think of what an apple is, things go on in your brain, and you have brain activation patterns,” Just added. “...[T]he amazing thing is it’s the same thing that happens in my brain.” 
These neurological patterns exist not only for objects like apples, but also for abstract emotions like anger. The identification of these common neural patterns has profound implications for the criminal justice system, where the technology may help identify the presence of remorse or other motivation.
“It’s nice to have video tape, it’s nice to have eye witnesses, but we also have to take into account what the accused perpetrator was thinking,” Just said. “Were they really planning to stab someone for weeks and weeks, or did they trip while carrying the knife?”
Just acknowledged that several hurdles remain before this technology is ready for use in the courtroom.
“With this technique, you still can’t tell whether this person is sincere or not. But one of the experiments that Karim and I have on the drawing boards is having sincere versus fake remorse, sincere versus fake anger,” he said.
This research provides evidence for the theory of a biological basis of emotion and the foundations for reading others’ thoughts and can have implications in the field of human-computer interaction.

Carnegie Mellon students have been grieving the loss of the Caribou Coffee on Forbes Avenue in Oakland, as well as Caribou Coffee locations in the Waterworks Mall and Southside Works on East Carson Street, all of which closed on Sept. 8. 
Peet’s Coffee and Tea will replace many of Caribou Coffee’s current locations.
“I like it better than Starbucks; I’m not quite sure why,” said sophomore biology and psychology double major Nina Hill. “Starbucks is so commercialized, like, ‘Oh, let’s get some Starbucks.’ It’s like the way people refer to Band-Aids, like instead of [calling them] adhesive bandages, it’s Band-Aids. It’s branded.”
Caribou Coffee, based in Minneapolis and founded in 1992, has over 500 company-owned locations across 16 states and Washington, D.C., along with locations outside the U.S., according to its website. 
According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Mike Tattersfield, CEO of Caribou Coffee Co., wrote a statement that “over the past few months, we at Caribou have revisited our business strategy, including closely evaluating our performance by market to make decisions that best position us for long-term growth.”
Sophomore biology and chemistry double major Jill Jaycox remembers an incident when Caribou Coffee made a positive impression on her. “One day [I] was running and got really thirsty, so I went to Caribou Coffee and they gave me free water. It was very nice — I’m a fan of Caribou Coffee.”
Caribou Coffee stores are closing in Ohio; Michigan; Washington, D.C.; Maryland; Virginia; Georgia; Illinois; eastern Wisconsin; and other parts of Pennsylvania. 
The Caribou Coffee on Brownsville Road in Brentwood had closed even earlier than the locations in Oakland, the Waterworks, and South Side. 
The closings come after Caribou Coffee was acquired last April by Joh. A. Benckiser, a German investment firm. 
The same firm also recently bought Peet’s, according to the Pittsburgh Business Times. 
The four Pittsburgh locations are only a few of the 88 stores being replaced by Peet’s Coffee and Tea,  a coffee chain based in Berkeley, California.
Alice Borie, a sophomore information systems major and Northern California native, is eager for the arrival of the traditionally West Coast chain. 
“I’m excited for Peet’s because it means that the West Coast is coming to the East Coast. They have really good pastries, their coffee is really good, and they have really cool coffee mugs,” Borie said. Peet’s was founded by Alfred Peet in 1966 in Berkeley. 
According to the company’s website, Peet was “shocked by what the U.S. called coffee” when he came to America from Holland after World War II.
Peet’s promises on its website “small batches, fresh beans, superior quality, and a dark roast produc[ing] a coffee that [is] rich and complex.”
Peet’s, according to the Post-Gazette, started its expansion into the Midwest in August.
Peet’s plans to open 10 stores in the Cleveland area; six stores in the Columbus, Ohio area; and two stores in Dayton, Ohio.
“We’re excited to bring Peet’s to more neighborhoods across the U.S. and will share more details on further store openings in the Midwest and East Coast at a later time,” said Peet’s spokeswoman Amy Lester in an email to the Post-Gazette.

Members of Juntos, a cross-cultural service organization, spoke about their experiences volunteering in Nicaragua last Thursday during the Tartans Abroad Showcase in the University Center.
The student group, which focuses on service initiatives in Rosa Grande, Nicaragua — as well as in Pittsburgh — recently received a Tartans Abroad scholarship, which helped members travel to Nicaragua last May.
While there, students took part in various community-building projects. In an educational initiative, Juntos members developed multiple workshops on how to use Microsoft Office, which they shared with Nicaraguan professors. An art initiative took the form of a collaborative mural with village school children.
Junior business administration major Grace Han, who traveled with the group in May, reflected on the group’s success in gearing its workshops toward the needs of the Nicaraguans, rather than imposing its own agenda. The locals appreciated this attitude, Juntos members said.
“Helping others isn’t always going to be glamorous and big,” Han said. “Sometimes it’s going to be small but really significant.”
Juntos co-leader Juan Acosta, a junior professional writing and Hispanic studies double major, stressed the group members’ desire not just to complete projects but also to reflect on the meaning of their service.
“We [Juntos] are really emphasizing the bigger ideas behind what we’re doing, asking questions like, ‘What does service mean?’ and ‘What does it mean to you?’ ” Acosta said. “We’re looking at the larger context of how this act of going to this country and interacting with these people reflects on us and this larger institution and the fact that they’re funding us.”
But the service does not end after the trip, Acosta emphasized. 
Engaging with people at home and offering fresh perspectives is just as important to Juntos members’ efforts to better their communities.
“You can have an impact, and you can be an agent of social change just through dialogue,” Acosta said.
Audience members watching the presentation were generally receptive of the group’s message about the richness of local and international service.
“Sometimes people get critical about helping others abroad instead of at home, but I think this is really a worthy cause that I can hopefully join,” sophomore psychology and modern languages double major Sammie Walker said.
In order to apply for a Tartans Abroad scholarship, which funds groups like Juntos as well as individuals, students must fill out a formal application. 
These scholarships apply only to academic breaks; the application for the upcoming winter session is due Oct. 31. 
Students interested in other study abroad opportunities can call the Office of International Education and make an appointment with a study abroad adviser.
“Studying abroad is a great way for students to intellectually expand their horizons,” Coordinator for Study Abroad and Exchange Programs Chris Menand said. “It creates new independence and creativity to work with people who think differently from you.”
The Office of International Education can be reached at (412) 268-5231.

New associate dean for research in engineering
Carnegie Mellon recently announced Gary Fedder, the Howard M. Wilkoff professor of electrical and computer engineering, as the new associate dean for research in engineering. 
Fedder earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1982 and his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1994.
Fedder will also continue as director of the Insitute for Complex Engineered Systems with support from associate director Burak Ozdoganlar, professor of mechanical engineering.
Fedder came to Carnegie Mellon in 1994, working in both the department of electrical and computer engineering and the Robotics Institute. His research interests focus on the field of microelectromechanical systems.
“This is a wonderful opportunity to continue our ongoing goal of developing novel technologies for the future and for promoting the growth of knowledge workers as we seek to create enduring innovation for the region and the global marketplace,” Fedder said in a university press release.
Fedder played an important role in research that allowed Carnegie Mellon to become part of the U.S. Department of Defense’s new National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII). 
The Youngstown, Ohio-based institute is helping to develop additive manufacturing technology, commonly known as 3–D printing.
James H. Garret Jr., dean of the College of Engineering, and Thomas Lord professor of civil and environmental engineering, are pleased with Fedder’s appointment.
“I am extremely pleased that Gary has agreed to be the first CIT associate dean for research,” Garrett said in the press release. “His stellar research reputation, his interdisciplinary perspective, and his experience in leading many college-wide research proposals, such as NAMII, make Gary ideally suited for this new position.”
CMU students named Siebel Scholars
The Siebel Scholars Foundation has named five Carnegie Mellon University graduate students to the 2014 class of Siebel Scholars.
The students are Jason Richard Koenig, a master’s student in computer science; Anuj Kumar, a Ph.D. candidate in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII); Gabriela Marcu, also a Ph.D. candidate in the HCII; Ishan Misra, a master’s student in the Robotics Institute; and Mrinmaya Sachan, a master’s student in the Language Technologies Institute.
Koenig’s research interests include formal verification, static analysis techniques, and formal methods. In spring 2013, he interned at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, where he developed a tool for analyzing embedded flight software.
Kumar has collaborated with industry groups at Microsoft and IBM, as well as university groups at the University of California, Berkeley. Two of Kumar’s papers were nominated for best paper awards at the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems.
The Siebel Scholars program recognizes the most talented graduate students in the fields of business, bioengineering, and computer science. Siebel Scholars are chosen based on outstanding academic achievement — on average, Siebel Scholars are in the top 5 percent of their class — and demonstrated leadership. Each Siebel Scholar will receive a $35,000 grant for his or her final year of study.

Underage Drinking
Sept. 6, 2013
A University Police officer on patrol stopped on Fifth Avenue to check on a student’s well-being. The male student and his friend confirmed that they had been drinking. Both men were under the legal drinking age and received underage drinking citations.
Bicycle Theft
Sept. 7, 2013
University Police were summoned to Hamerschlag House this week when a student reported his bike stolen from the building’s bicycle rack. The student had secured the Cannondale bicycle at 8 p.m. and realized that the lock had been cut and the bike stolen at midnight. This investigation is ongoing.
Attempted Robbery
Sept. 7, 2013
University Police, University of Pittsburgh police, and city police officers were dispatched to the area of Forbes Avenue and South Craig Street in reference to an attempted robbery. The victims stated that an African American male with a thin build demanded marijuana and money from the two victims. When the victims told the suspect that they had neither, he threatened to shoot them and gestured to a black handgun tucked in his waistband. The suspect then fled the scene. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is investigating this incident.
Underage Drinking
Sept. 8, 2013
University Police and CMU EMS responded to the lobby of Resnik House in reference to an intoxicated male. The police were contacted after a resident assistant unsuccessfully attempted to stop the male from leaving the area. The male was later transported to the hospital by city medics, and cited for underage drinking.
Internal Discipline Citation
Sept. 9, 2013 
A Carnegie Mellon student received a Carnegie Mellon internal discipline citation for disorderly conduct as a result of his behavior and interaction with a University Police officer in reference to a parking complaint.
Laptop and Cellphone Theft
Sept. 11, 2013
University Police were summoned to the University Center in reference to a theft report. The victim stated that she left her cell phone and laptop unattended for 10-15 minutes on a table outside the exercise room on the second floor around 9:40 p.m. When she returned, the items were gone.
Sweatshirt Theft
Sept. 12, 2013 
University Police were summoned to the University Center Bookstore when someone activated the panic alarm. Officers were informed that an Indian male between 20 and 30 years old had grabbed a Carnegie Mellon sweatshirt and exited the bookstore in the direction of the Cut. This investigation is ongoing.

Joint Funding Committee Applications
Joint Funding Committee (JFC) applications are now open. The JFC convenes in the spring to put together budgets for student organizations for the next school year. Interested candidates can contact Student Body Vice President for Finance Jalen Poteat (sbvpf@andrew.cmu.edu) for more information.
Vacancy Elections
The Senate chair discussed the upcoming vacancy elections. To run for a vacant Senate seat, a student must gather signatures from members of his or her college. Current senators will then vote on the candidates.
There are five vacant seats in the College of Engineering, three in the College of Fine Arts, and one in the School of Computer Science.
Points of Discussion
A senator asked the Senate Chair Lukas Ronner how Senate Week planning is coming along. Ronner responded that Senate Week has been budgeted for and the promotional handouts have been approved. Speakers and the schedule have been set, but the public relations still need planning. Senate Week will be the week of Oct. 21.
Senators also discussed a student who had been selling parts of the fence earlier that day. The student had collected the pieces over the summer as they fell off the fence and was selling them as part of an art class.
Special Allocation: Sigma Phi Epsilon
There was a motion to allocate $800 to Sigma Phi Epsilon for its Labor Day Barbecue. Since there was no non-Senate representative from Sigma Phi Epsilon to speak for the fraternity, Senate Finance Chair Andrew Schwartz spoke instead. 
He made the point that the Labor Day Barbecue benefited the entire campus, and at one point was run by Senate. Schwartz noted, too, that similar allocations for Sigma Phi Epsilon’s Labor Day Barbecue have been approved in previous years. 
The allocation was funded without change, after a hand vote.

Beta Theta Pi was suspended from campus last semester after allegations regarding the filming and circulation of sexually explicit photos and video, which led to a subsequent investigation into severe hazing. The suspension was announced in an email by Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno. During the summer, Beta’s national chapter announced that their Carnegie Mellon chapter would permanently close.
Carnegie Mellon refused to comment on the incident at the time because the University Police’s investigation was still ongoing. However, since that message in the spring, there has been no update from university administration about the investigation’s progress or its conclusion.
Carnegie Mellon needs to inform the university community of the current status of the Beta investigation.
Beta has come into the spotlight again, as Rolling Stone magazine recently published its list of “The Most Out-Of-Control Fraternities in America” last month and ranked Carnegie Mellon’s Beta chapter fourth in the nation.
Though the scandal surrounding individuals in Beta may have faded, the incident itself has clearly not disappeared, and neither has its impact on the Carnegie Mellon community. Any violation of students’ rights to safety and privacy is a black mark against the university. Carnegie Mellon should avoid an unsavory reputation for Greek life, especially because Greek life is an important and vibrant part of the campus community. Carnegie Mellon should be as open and transparent as possible regarding the scandal’s aftermath to protect its reputation.
The university should be more responsible to its student body by informing the campus community if the investigation is still ongoing, and if it is not, what conclusions the University Police have reached so far. The university should also specify what legal repercussions the investigation will yield. While the university cannot release the names of individuals accused of crimes in connection with the scandal, the campus community should know if charges have been filed, and what those charges were.
The university should also open a dialogue about what steps are being taken to ensure that an incident like this does not occur again. 
No matter how many individuals were involved in the incident, the university has an obligation to ensure that individuals do not commit acts of questionable nature within a student organization again. In creating a dialogue, the university should also inform the campus community of what steps they have already taken to minimize the possibility of future incidents.
The Beta scandal is a delicate issue, and must be treated with the utmost care. However, handling a situation with the care it deserves and failing to keep the campus community informed about such a monumentally important issue are not the same thing. The university should release an update on the Beta investigation as soon as possible.

Over the last few decades, technology companies have fought to edge out competitors with more and more powerful devices. To display their power, they added more detail to their operating systems, with three-dimensional interfaces that bleakly mimicked real-world objects, in an attempt to ease the learning curve for new users.
Recently, Apple has been the largest offender of real-world object imitation, so much so that the word “skeumorphism” has become synonymous with its company name. Skeumorphism, or the imitation of real-life objects in software, favored greatly by the late Steve Jobs, found its way into nearly every aspect of iOS. 
Apple added everything from leather-textured siding in its Calendar application to spinning reels in its Voice Memos application. While this eye candy was initially appealing, it quickly became obtrusive to the experienced user and provided no functional benefits.
With iOS 7, Apple attempted to change its mobile operating system’s design language, to one simpler and less obtrusive in nature. Jonathan Ive, senior vice president of design at Apple, immediately set forth to change the design of iOS after he was given responsibility to lead and direct Apple’s Human Interface division in October 2012, according to the company’s press release.
Having used iOS 7 for the past few weeks, I can say that it is a joy to use. The icons that once overflowed with detail are now flat and minimalistic. The lock screen is free from its once-restricting black bars, welcoming users to slide-to-unlock anywhere. Menus, navigation bars, and Apple’s first party apps have adapted the same flat interface that acts as a background to the user’s experience instead of trying to be the center of attention.
Ironically, the removal of skeumorphism has made the operating system feel more natural. Menu navigation is more fluid, as one can swipe across the screen instead of relying on the previous back arrow icons.
Apple’s choice to remove skeumorphism has resulted in a more functional and powerful operating system, and has closed the difference between desktop and mobile computing. Simple graphs displaying sound wavelengths during recording have replaced unhelpful spinning reels in Voice Memos. In an ecosystem limited by screen size, the removal of functionless eye candy makes room for more powerful and functional applications.
The irony of this transformation in design is that it’s actually a step backward. Ever since Apple introduced the original Macintosh, the goal of software companies has been to emulate real-life objects in a way that relates to users. The idea for a desktop was essentially a copy of a real-life desk covered with items. Similarly, the idea of a folder system was simply a copy of a real-life organizer.
The interface was created on the idea of emulating real-life objects in a way that significantly lowers the learning curve of operating systems. Apple and many other companies have learned, however, that a touchscreen is not a piece of lined paper, nor a physical tape recorder. In that sense, it is less capable than other real-life objects. 
However, in many ways, it can outperform them. Several companies, including Apple, are learning that when they attempt to make devices into something they are not, they are limiting their capabilities and functionalities. iOS 7 takes a step away from these interfaces into the right direction.

Sepp Blatter, president of the world’s soccer governing body, gave a speech in 2010 at the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) headquarters in Zurich, on both the physical and cultural space that soccer had traversed, according to FIFA’s official website. He evoked the fundamental ideals that the World Cup and the Olympics are based on — world peace and acceptance of diversity. 
Blatter’s speech also preceded the announcement of the host nations of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The two winning nations could possibly be two of the worst locales for hosting soccer’s premier event.
Russia, which recently came under fire for its policies against homosexuality, will host the World Cup in 2018, while Qatar will host the World Cup in 2022. To a discerning soccer fan, Russia barely makes more sense than Qatar. Russia has a promising young crop of players, along with some competitive European club teams like Zenit St. Petersburg, CSKA Moscow, and Anzhi Makhachkala.
What does Qatar have? Blatter says that FIFA chose Qatar because of plans to extend soccer culture into the region. Although an admirable goal, there were three key questions asked when Qatar was announced, and all of them are still hot topics for debate. These three topics point to FIFA’s puzzling behavior and question FIFA’s goal of soccer development.
The first topic is climate. Simply put, it’s pretty hard to run around for 90 minutes in 122˚F weather.
So why did FIFA pick such a harsh climate, other than to encourage FIFA spirit in the region? Many critics, such as U.S. national team star Eric Wynalda, immediately pointed to Qatar’s oil reserves and the capital that comes along with them, and of course, the bulging pockets of FIFA voters, reported ESPN. 
Oil money, however, is a common factor in European soccer. The Telegraph says that Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the half-brother of the United Arab Emirates’ president, has spent nearly $1.5 billion on Manchester City — an English team — in player transfers, wages, and stadium expansions.
Furthermore, whistleblower Phaedra Al Majid came forward and accused FIFA voting members of corruption and bribery, according to The Guardian. Her case was soon denied and knocked aside, with Al Majid herself making a U-turn and denying any wrongdoings by Qatar agents. Considering Qatar’s surprising bidding victory and mountains of money, as well as FIFA’s general operational and financial opaqueness, it does not take much imagination to speculate about a large-scale corruption scandal.
The last issue is one that Russia shares, as host of the 2018 World Cup and the 2014 Winter Olympics. Qatar and Russia do not provide suitable political, social, and religious environments.
The 40,000-plus seating stadiums all look amazing, but Qatar is a tiny nation-state. In fact, Qatar is so small that in 2010 it would not have been able to handle the massive influx of fans and tourists just because it did not have sufficient hotel space, said FIFA in its 2022 FIFA World Cup Bid Evaluation Report: Qatar. FIFA said in the bid book that with the stadiums, labor costs would be astronomical  — amounting to approximately $3 billion — even when considering Qatar’s mountains of money. A large majority of the workers will come from Asia and will endure harsh working and living conditions, possibly triggering human rights violations, says the Human Rights Watch. Imagine the 122-degree weather  and then picture the overcrowded migrant-worker “labor camps” — as Human Rights Watch labeled them — which have no air conditioning or ventilation.
Qatar also outright bans any homosexual activity. Blatter said that “gay fans should refrain from any sexual activities” during their stay, reported BBC. BBC said that Qatar was one of 79 member nations that sanctioned extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions on the grounds of sexual orientation during a United Nations vote. Bear in mind that the Olympics, and by extension, the World Cup, only started to encourage sportsmanship, international cooperation and equality for all. 
All of this behavior — including Qatar, Blatter, and FIFA’s behavior — points to the worrying fact that the nature of FIFA, the International Olympic Committee, and the internationalist spirit in the world of sports is changing. 
The beauty of soccer is its simplicity and wide appeal. A ball is all that is needed to start playing. Soccer has come such a long way and has broken many barriers, but now it is time to break new ones. Soccer is supposed to be a source of hope to humanity, discipline, and respect, as Blatter says in the welcome text of the Sepp Blatter Foundation website. International sporting events highlight diversity and the acceptance of different races, religions, and political alignments. But looking ahead in 2022, FIFA seems to be centering itself around wealth, flair, and a complete disregard for its fundamental purpose of bringing different people together under the banner of soccer and its spirit.

Late last year, a young physiotherapy intern in New Delhi was brutally gang-raped after boarding a bus by six men, according to The Washington Post. The attackers included the driver and one minor. The woman died soon after due to her injuries. Recently, a 22-year-old photojournalist from Mumbai was gang-raped in an abandoned textile factory, reports The Guardian. Additionally, Michaela Cross (otherwise known as Rose Chasm), published a now famous CNN iReport, in which she describes in horrific detail the way she was stared at, groped and harassed daily by Indian men during a study abroad trip to India in 2012.
As a young Indian man, I feel an uneasy mix of shame and indignation when I think about these incidents. The fact that Indian men can perform such acts is shameful, but at the same time, these isolated incidents result in the creation of broad stereotypes and incorrect generalizations. The really heart-breaking part about Michaela Cross’s CNN piece is the thousands of comments that accompany it. Some implore people, especially women, to stay away from India. Some apologize to Michaela on the behalf of Indians everywhere. There is ignorance, but also fear in what people wrote. As I read the comments, I found myself getting defensive and thinking, “We’re not all like that.”
India gives a whole new meaning to the word diversity. With 1.2 billion people, over 500 languages and dialects, and more than ten widely practiced religions, one simply cannot speak about every Indian citizen in one breath. I’m convinced that most Indian men are actually very helpful and warm people. 
There were 75,744 reported cases of sexual violence (including rape, molestation and harassment) in India in 2011, according to crowdvoice.org. The equivalent figure for the United States is 207,754 cases, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network. India’s population is approximately four times that of America’s population, yet the United States’s rate of sexual violence is greater. Isn’t it a little unfair to generalize the negative tendencies observed in 75,744 people onto the 655.8 million males in Indian society?
Admittedly, the entire issue is bigger than just the number of sexual violence cases. According to Delhi-based psychologist Rajat Mitra in India Today, a substantial portion of sexual assault cases in India go unreported. It is even more depressing that a small minority of sexual offenders can poison India’s culture and create an atmosphere of fear. The average Indian woman longs for freedom from a society that has very strict expectations for her. 
Society may not hesitate to blame sexual assault on the victim, if it is believed that these expectations were disregarded. Especially in rural India, a girl must take certain necessary precautions, such as dressing conservatively, largely avoiding male company, and staying indoors after dark. Even in the urban and fairly liberalized setting of Mumbai, most of my female friends wouldn’t wear shorts on the streets, or dare to step out alone after 10 p.m.
However, things are getting better. There is room for optimism. The New Delhi rape led to one of the largest demonstrations against sexual violence the world has ever seen. Massive protest rallies populated by both women and men engulfed the city for weeks. The Mumbai case led to similar, albeit comparatively smaller rallies. Michaela Cross’s piece probably wouldn’t have gotten the massive response it did if it came out a couple of years ago.
A critical mass of people are talking about change — the kind of change that rarely comes along — in the privacy of their homes and in the public forum. People are tired of a small population of men distorting reality for the rest of us.

Following talks in London on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s alleged use of deadly toxins on civilians, Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov have agreed to destroy Syria’s chemical weapons by by mid-2014, according to The Daily Mail. The Assad regime agreed to sign the United Nations’ chemical weapons ban treaty and became a legitimate member of the Chemical Weapons Convention this past week.
However, tensions persist as world leaders attempt to bring an end to Syria’s civil war without destabilizing the region, according to The New York Times. By agreeing to the solution that Kerry made as an off-handed comment during the London talks, Russia has been forced into a position of responsibility by international pressures in a high-stakes bid to prevent U.S. military intervention on the continent.
If unsuccessful, Moscow’s legitimacy and soft power hegemony in international politics could be substantially weakened, reports The Guardian. 
If successful, however, the agreement could result in stronger ties between Washington and Moscow and may usher Syria into an era of stability. While uncertainty still lingers, Syria’s legal membership in the International Convention on Chemical Weapons means that regardless of the plan’s outcome, Kerry’s accidental diplomacy has brought the Assad regime a step closer to political legitimacy and stability.
Looking into the future, placing Syria under the United Nations’s control and transitioning the government away from Assad should be the primary goal of American foreign policy. While an arms deal may stem the tide of civilian suppression and weaken Syria’s resolve, casualties will continue under the regime as long as Assad fights to maintain power.
Kerry and Obama have discussed the notion that a military strike may occur regardless of deals on chemical arms in order to ensure that Syria does not have the resources required to stifle resistance movements and kill innocent civilians, according to The Guardian. International actors should be wary of Syria’s internal conflicts and move forward with a plan that will stunt the Assad regime, reduce civilian casualties, and allow rebel forces to gain the upper hand.
Both Kerry and Obama should consider moving forward with military intervention and rebel aid even after Assad forfeits his chemical weapons. By stunting the dictatorship’s ability to use weapons of mass destruction and providing guidance to opposing forces, the U.S. would be able to help Syria transition into a democracy while minimizing backlash and regional destabilization.

Warner Bros. Entertainment announced Thursday in a press release that the company will be partnering with J.K. Rowling for a variety of new projects based on the author's published works. Notable projects include the expansion of various locations of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and a new film series titled*"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,*, penned by Rowling herself and based on a book she published in 2001 that is set in the world of Harry Potter.
It is refreshing to see such a world-renowned author open to having her source material adapted for other entertainment media. More importantly, her firmness in maintaining tight control over the creations ensures the quality of the adapted works.
Rowling has been known to work closely with others on projects related to her original source materials. Upon the film release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, The New York Times wrote that she consulted Steve Kloves, who adapted the Harry Potter books into films, about the movie scripts when he took them in the wrong direction or neglected to portray a character correctly. She also took aside actor Alan Rickman, who plays the books' baddest teacher Professor Snape, and revealed to him some key character plot points before the release of her books to allow him to portray the character accurately, according to The Huffington Post. 
The Today Show reported that Rowling also collaborated with Tom Williams, the chairman and CEO of Universal Parks and Resorts, to ensure that she was satisfied with the Wizarding World of Harry Potter when it first opened in 2009. She is now working with producers on a television adaptation of her first adult novel, The Casual Vacancy, to be aired on BBC One in 2014, according to BBC.
Her close work with the movies and theme parks have paid off so far, and there is little reason to believe that the quality of entertainment based on her books will slip anytime soon, as hinted at by the stellar work produced thus far. By collaborating willingly and closely with those wishing to adapt her novels, Rowling has ensured that her original visions are not forgotten. The fact that she is writing the latest film based on her original Harry Potter series is promising too: She has shown herself a masterful storyteller though print, and this latest endeavor into screenplay should prove no different. The story line also promises to be brand new, meaning that the film should not feel like material used in previous films being rehashed as a profit-making venture.
Rowling is admirable for her willingness to give her fans more ways to enjoy her works while remaining deeply involved in their adaptations to ensure that each new product is just as engaging as the original.

The New York Times published an article last week about Harvard Business School’s (HBS’s) recent attempts to change its campus culture — specifically pertaining to sexism — for both students and members of the faculty. Female students were falling behind their male counterparts in both grades and class participation, and the male faculty far outnumbered the female faculty. Over one-third of HBS students were women in 2008, yet less than 20 percent were Baker scholars, or in the top 5 percent of the class, according to The New York Times.
Students and faculty alike reported a culture that was hostile to women, including hazing of female students and professors, and a lack of respect for female faculty. The New York Times reports that from 2006 to 2007, “a third of the female junior faculty left.” In 2010, the dean of HBS instituted a new program to increase awareness of gender issues. Students were required to attend discussions on gender relations at the school, and female faculty members received more extensive and comprehensive support from the administration.
Carnegie Mellon University has also had a history of being a male-dominated institution — and some would argue that it still is. This trend stemmed from a historically higher male enrollment, but manifested itself particularly in the sciences. However, the university’s female-to-male ratio has improved noticeably in recent years, and is now 2:3, according to Carnegie Mellon’s enrollment data. While this division is not perfect, it is definitely a step in the right direction.
Changing a campus’s culture can seem like an impossible task. Seminars can prove ineffective in the face of inequality, because a culture of inequality is engendered by deeply ingrained behaviors — one that people learn long before they ever get to the university setting. 
But Harvard’s initiative in this matter paid off. 
Although some of the students expressed dissatisfaction with the program — particularly with the campus-wide gender discussions — grades of female students shot up as they were encouraged more to participate in the classroom, and performance reviews of female faculty members increased rapidly as the teachers received more support from the administration, according to The New York Times.
HBS observed something in their culture that they disagreed with, and took steps to remedy that issue. Carnegie Mellon’s new female-to-male ratio shows that the university is also able to overcome habits and cultural stereotypes. With HBS’s initiative to fight gender issues as an example, Carnegie Mellon can also make progress on ingrained issues.
Although Carnegie Mellon has tried something similar with its ingrained stress culture, there has been limited success. Part of the difference between HBS’s and Carnegie Mellon’s situations lies in the way that those cultures manifested; at HBS, sexism was so pervasive that male students would harass even female faculty members, and female performance across the board was lower than that of males, because female students were not receiving the same support, according to The New York Times. 
Explaining to students that sexism is wrong and should be avoided is a more concrete concept to make apparent to students than explaining to students that they don’t need to push themselves past the limits of their own endurance to get the best grades, because stress culture is fundamentally tied to the natural desire to succeed in life. However, HBS’s recent successes with a deeply entrenched culture could lead Carnegie Mellon in a more positive direction with its own attempts to change from within.
