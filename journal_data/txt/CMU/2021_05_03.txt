The Carnegie Mellon softball team visited the Allegheny Gators for a double-header on Tuesday, and a standout performance by junior Gwen Delacruz, both at the plate and in the circle, along with a career-first home run by first-year Addy Sewack, helped the Tartans take both games cleanly.
In game one, neither team made substantial progress in the first inning, but Delacruz’s hit at the top of the second allowed junior Io Jette-Kouri to score Carnegie Mellon’s first run. A huge, base-clearing hit by sophomore Tessa Bruneau then added three more runs to the scoreboard. The Tartans did well to hold onto their lead, limiting Allegheny to a single run in the bottom of the second, and headed into the third inning leading 4-1. Another big hit from Delacruz at the top of the third added two runs to the Carnegie Mellon tally, and the Tartans quickly closed out the inning, giving Allegheny no chance to score. The fourth inning swung in favor of the Gators, with the visitors unable to capitalize in the top, and the home side recording four runs in the bottom to make it 6-5.
The fifth inning saw Delacruz hit left and junior Audra Scheinman sprint home to put Carnegie Mellon up 7-5, before an Allegheny throwing error with the bases loaded increased the margin to 10-5. Once again, the Tartans prevented the Gators from scoring any runs in the bottom of the fifth. Unfortunately, Carnegie Mellon was unable to keep their momentum in the top of the sixth, ending the inning with no runs scored. Allegheny fought back, recording two runs in the bottom of the inning to make the score 10-7. In the final inning, junior Megan Hu hit into the left field with the bases loaded, and the Tartans scored two more runs. Allegheny managed one more run in the bottom of the seventh, but it wasn’t enough, and the Tartans took game one 12-8.
The Tartans started out game two with a run by first-year Kiera Boucher following a single by sophomore Emily Finger in the first inning, then doubles from junior Meghan Holquist, Sewack, and Boucher, coupled with runs by junior Audrey Pederson, along with Holquist and Bruneau, put Carnegie Mellon up 4-0. A throwing error that followed a hit by Hu then allowed Boucher to reach home, allowing the Tartans to end the second inning 5-0. The visitors were unable to capitalize in the third inning, while the home side scored one run to make it 5-1.
This result was flipped for the next two innings, with the Gators unable to score as Bruneau and Scheinman’s hits saw Scheinman and junior Emily Song score for the Tartans, in the fourth and fifth innings respectively, extending the scoreline to 7-1. The sixth inning was runless, with neither team able to capitalize. Sewack hit a fantastic home run in the top of the seventh inning, and Allegheny responded with one run of their own in the bottom to make the final game two score 8-2 in favor of the Tartans.
With this sweeping victory, the Carnegie Mellon softball team is now 12-5-1 for the season.

Duolingo named to Time Magazine’s list of 100 most influential companies
Whether you’re doing it for a class or just doing it for fun, learning a new language is a great way to broaden your horizons. Thanks to Duolingo, learning a language is easy with daily reminders to practice your skills right on your phone. Duolingo has had a significant impact during the pandemic, as their English language certification course allowed more international students to apply to U.S. universities without an in-person exam.

ETC outreach plays on after students graduate
With a focus on project-based learning, Carnegie Mellon University’s Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) drives innovation by having students work together to create games and technology-based products for a client. Clients sometimes include local school districts, and the projects live on and continue to play a role in the education of students grades K-12 long after their initial creators have graduated. As Scott Stevens, a teaching professor at the ETC, explains, “The projects that we do with schools tend to be some of the most rewarding for our students.”

To think of a world beyond our own that can potentially support life feels like the plot of a science fiction novel. However, the relentless work of generations of scientists is slowly transforming this seemingly impossible idea into reality with research on Mars. In an effort to bring us a step closer in learning more about Mars, scientists from NASA recently launched Perseverance, a space rover meant to collect data (specifically rock and soil samples) that may suggest the existence of ancient life forms on Mars. 
Along with Perseverance came Ingenuity, a drone-like helicopter that was attached to the bottom of Perseverance before its flight to Mars as a technological demonstration. Upon its launch into space, scientists were unsure of whether Ingenuity would successfully maneuver itself through Mars’ extremely thin atmosphere, even after performing many tests on the helicopter before its expedition. Their hard work paid off when the flight of Ingenuity became the first ever powered and controlled flight on a world beyond Earth.
With the help of the photos collected by both Perseverance and Ingenuity’s revolutionary flight on Mars, we can now look deeper into the details of the Martian terrain.

Welcome to Maddy's Monthly Meme Madness, where we take a look at the top five most-liked memes on the Facebook group, Carnegie Mellon Memes for Spicy Teens, posted in the past month.
1: “Priorities” by Miles Williams (10/10)
Williams absolutely dominates this month’s meme review with not just one, not two, but three memes. This one rightfully earned its place in first place. I’m especially impressed with the seamless blend connecting Farnam’s head and the frat boy’s body. Also, the accuracy: ow.
2: “Buildings” by Nancy Zuo (9.5/10)
As a Dietrich kiddo, I take offense in the implication that majors in Dietrich are secondary. Jokes aside, this is a solid meme. The use of Comic Sans is tastefully done, and it works especially well in the gradient rainbow title. Zuo’s caption, “non-freshman reacts only,” is a harrowing reminder of our… current circumstances.  
3: “Self-assessment” by Abdulhadi Sultan Qureshi (9.5/10)
The self-assessments have their purpose, but the interrogation that ensues if you step foot into UHS and have not done your self-assessment… is real. I can still feel the nurses’ judgy eyes looking down on me as I type.
4: “Carnival 2021” by [Miles Williams] (8/10)
My heart goes out for the freshmen and sophomores (and anyone else) who never got to experience Spring Carnival. I appreciate the effort put behind the virtual events, but it’s like eating Halo Top to satisfy your ice cream craving. You get the hint of what it’s supposed to replace, but you still feel the gaping emptiness lingering. Anyways, this meme is solid but significantly less impressive than the first.
5: “Stress” by [Miles Williams] (9/10)
Williams started this month’s meme review with a bang and certainly ended with a bang. The editing skills drastically differ from the Frat Boy Farnam that we saw earlier, but the hastily-done edits are artfully done. Crudely-made art is a surprisingly difficult skill to master.

Carnegie Mellon students have been circulating a petition asking the university’s administration to take action in response to the COVID-19 humanitarian crisis in India. The petition, which has over 250 student and 60 faculty signatures, was created on April 25 and asks Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian to help India deal with the COVID-19 surge in four main ways. 
First, the petitioners asked that Carnegie Mellon recognizes the stress that this new wave of COVID-19 in India has caused for students. Second, they also requested that Jahanian advocate for the United States government to ease the restrictions on the Defense Production Act, which they say would facilitate the export of critical materials for healthcare supplies and vaccines to India.  Furthermore, it asks for the Carnegie Mellon administration to advocate for the processing of a Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) waiver, which they say would help alleviate the vaccine shortage in India through the sharing of intellectual property and vaccine technology. Finally, the petition also asks Carnegie Mellon to mobilize its alumni network to increase donations to help India and to allow for student organizations to contribute a portion of their budget to donate to organizations helping India.  
Four days after the petition was released, President Jahanian released a statement via email to the entire Carnegie Mellon University community. He acknowledged the “devastating impact of COVID-19 in India” and that this surge has compounded stress on many students. Jahanian also wrote that he is working with the faculty to grant accommodations and additional support for students affected by the COVID-19 crisis in India. Jahanian also encouraged students to reach out to the Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) if needed.  
President Jahanian went on to say that Carnegie Mellon University would continue to advocate for proactive measures to assist India. He also announced that Carnegie Mellon partnered with nine other institutions from Pennsylvania in signing a letter "urging swift action in support of students around the world, including possibly waiving in-person interview requirements or allowing visa interviews to be conducted online." He also acknowledged the possibility of student organizations donating a part of their annual budget, and said that he had tasked administrators with determining "how the university can support these student efforts."

The Undergraduate Senate general body meeting on April 29 featured a guest talk on changes to academic advising, an end-of-the-year report on the state of student organizations, and a vote on whether to make the existing fund for student course materials permanent.
Vice Provost for Education Amy Burkert updated the Senate on academic advising, student success, and equity. She discussed how academic advising had been consolidated from various different departments into the Student Academic Success Center (SASC), allowing students to refer to one location for academic advising and resources. She mentioned that the university was moving toward having all advisers have a baseline knowledge of the different areas of advising while still preserving major and expertise-specific advising.
In addition, Burkert discussed the outlook for the fall. She said that the university was expecting a significant return to in-person learning, with most classes, especially labs and studios, being offered in-person. She said that the university would still preserve some remote-only courses for students unable to return to the U.S. If there was another spike in cases, Burkert said that the classes would not necessarily be going remote again, and instead, the university would focus on reducing the density of classes. 
The university anticipated some challenges in returning to in-person lectures, such as attendance, as online courses often gave more freedom with respect to attendance and scheduling. Burkert had read the Senate paper on preferred learning structures and recognized the benefits of preserving some kind of online lecture recordings, and also discussed the use of online course materials and notes through the Open Learning Initiative. Though Burkert expressed that there were concerns about recording lectures due to intellectual property issues and students not listening to lectures if they were recorded, she affirmed that the university was considering options of how they could continue to provide lecture recordings.
Student Body Vice President for Organizations Imran Hyder presented updates from the Committee of Student Organizations (CoSO). Hyder focused on the re-recognition process for student organizations, which this year was a form on The Bridge website. The results of the form at the time of the meeting confirmed that two student organizations would not be continuing. The Senate had anticipated more organizations terminating due to the pandemic restrictions, though around 60 organizations still had yet to fill out the form. If any of the organizations do not fill out the form, CoSO will contact SLICE for recommendations on further action, but Hyder said they would most likely try to preserve these organizations regardless.
The Senate also discussed whether to preserve the Student Supplies Fund. The Student Supplies Fund was created during the pandemic to fund required course materials not covered by financial aid, with a maximum of $500 per individual in funding. The Academic Affairs Committee proposed making this a permanent fund, as they believed the need to fund such materials would continue. Due to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the Student Supplies Fund could not collect proof of financial burden, so the fund was open to all students who needed materials covered. The Senate reported that, over the past year, about 45 people requested funds, with about two-thirds of the requests approved and approximately $4000 paid out in total. The majority of denials were due to requests for materials they were not able to fund. The Senate voted 14 to 0 to 2 to pass the proposal and make the Student Supplies Fund permanent.

For admissions offices, every year is a bit like the movie Groundhog Day: every year is a repeat of the one before. And after a while, I suppose, it must seem repetitive. But for high school seniors, it’s your only chance, and we are forced to know that all too well. There are endless college application-related Reddit threads and websites such as College Confidential with guidance on standardized testing, how to write college applications, and even “Chance Me’s,” an anonymous user’s guess on the chances the original poster (OP) could get into “X” college. Not to mention the pressure from other students, family members, and obviously, yourself. As you can probably guess, this results in tremendous amounts of stress on the students. And, for a while, thoughts of where I was going to end up for college consumed my brain. The online forums, unfortunately, had thousands of other students who were just as worried, and all those concerns fed into my anxiety even more. But the pandemic made me switch my focus to the parts of my life that took precedence over my college whereabouts. 
My grandma’s Alzheimer’s worsened rather quickly because of the isolation. She had several hip surgeries that limited her movement and found that the easiest form of exercise was swimming. My grandparents went swimming every day as part of a routine that helped stimulate her memory, but as a result of the pandemic, that routine vanished and it became difficult for my grandpa to replace that stimulation within their home. 
As the pandemic progressed and her health worsened, the number of attacks on Asians grew as well. But because I live in such a progressive area with a close-knit community, I felt as if the closest I would come to such racism would be through the news. Although often my family and I were the only Asians in the room, my community never made me feel as if I didn’t belong. But as my mother and I walked through our local flower market, a woman spewed racist remarks at my mother and me, one of which included that we were the cause of the virus. As I was about to yell back at her, my mother squeezed my arm and firmly told me to keep quiet. Later in the car, she told me how she had been in several of these situations and that it was best to stay put. But is that really best? I thought back to my grandma who, at that time, had only just received access to her local swimming pool, but now must constantly worry about the hate that is directed towards her in every attack against the Asian elderly. 
However, even through the hardship and stress of the pandemic and all the unfortunate experiences that came out of it, I was still concerned about making sure my Common Application essay was perfect or that I listed all of my achievements during my interviews. But was all that really worth it? I ended up committing to a college I am more than thankful to attend but regretful of the time I lost not devoting it to my family and their health. The pandemic, and so many aspects of it, were and still are aggravating. Yet, it has shone a light on the parts of my life that were ignored under a pile of books. I became the main caretaker of my grandma (as we have a strong bond) through her transition to the Alzheimer’s care facility, and I’ve also begun to produce a documentary on my community’s origins as an African American community following the Civil War. I know during my four years at Carnegie Mellon, I will be confronted with immeasurable amounts of stress, but I hope I can look back at the time my 17-year-old self lived through a pandemic and gain some confidence to keep pushing forward.

India has just passed 200,000 deaths due to COVID-19. With many not officially recorded, the number should be much larger, and the second wave much more severe, than we think. While vaccination efforts are underway, the issue remains that governments have allowed many pandemic measures to lapse, and complacency has run rampant around the world.
Indeed, some reopening plans are contingent on “a sufficient vaccination supply and stable and low hospitalization numbers,” such as California’s plan to reopen its economy by June 15. These plans understand that the situation is fluid and that many variables will impact our ability to reopen and move beyond a pandemic lifestyle. However, many relaxed measures are not being taken conditionally, and it is these that are most concerning. It can be expected that many will immediately resume pre-pandemic behaviors, including traveling without masks or social distancing, once restrictions are lifted or even just loosened.
This complete lack of awareness and responsibility is baffling, but apparently a legitimate component of our society today. It is imperative that the public understands that resuming a transmission-friendly environment will rapidly increase COVID-19 cases and deaths, sparking another wave and forcing the immediate reinstitution of pandemic restrictions.
This would be at odds with all hopeful plans set forth by schools and governments alike, from reopening campuses to boosting the economy. It will be impossible for us to have in-person classes and normal housing if transmission rates are anywhere near the levels seen around summer 2020, to say nothing of the recent holiday season.
We urge everyone to remember that loosened restrictions do not mean the virus is gone. An inability to understand the severity of such a pandemic will only ruin what little vitality we have left and deem our previous efforts to have been in vain. For all of our sakes, stay cautious and consider the long-term effects of your actions. To that end, get vaccinated, continue to practice social distancing, wear masks, wash your hands frequently, and follow the recommendations of health professionals and organizations like the CDC. We are so close to the end, so let’s all do our part to make sure society can continue moving forward rather than backward.
