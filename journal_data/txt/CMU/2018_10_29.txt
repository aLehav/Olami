In their last three games before the University Athletic Association (UAA) conference tournament begins next weekend, the Tartan’s women volleyball team went 2–0. The final game was cancelled by the university in response to the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue. Each of the first two matches went on as planned, with the Tartans taking on 19th-ranked Ithaca College on Friday and unranked Brockport on Saturday. The Tartans defeated Ithaca three sets to one, 25–16, 20–25, 25–22, and 25-15 and breezed past Brockport in straight sets, 25–19, 25–14, and 25–18.
The Friday night match against Ithaca moved the Tartan’s record for the year to 20–6, but the matchup resulted in a Tartan win thanks to various mistakes by Ithaca. Kills, attacks, assists, digs, blocks, and other non-error counting statistics for each team were just about the same, but the error statistics — hit errors and receiving errors — gave the Tartans the advantage in the match.
Strong individual performances from junior Maia So-Holloway and senior Lauren Mueller helped carry the Tartans to victory. So-Holloway had 41 of the team’s total 48 assists while Mueller recorded 14 kills to lead the team.
The Tartans dropped the second set to Ithaca, the first set that has ended with a losing decision in three matches. The Tartans have been on a roll recently, and they were able to continue their streak of domination against Brockport.
An early Saturday start time left Brockport struggling on the court, while the Tartans continued their strong play. A running theme of Tartan dominance from regimented production was evident in the weekend, as the same statistical phenomenon of capitalizing on opponent errors that appeared against Ithaca reappeared against Brockport.
So-Holloway again lead the team in assists with 28 of the total 34 for the Tartans. Senior Sarah Jurgens lead the team in kills with 11, but junior Erika Foose stood out with six kills on 11 attempts and no errors. This hot streak is a great sign for the Tartans going forward. They are performing well as the season winds down, so signs are pointing towards a strong performance in the playoffs.
With these two wins over the weekend, the Tartans have won four straight matches. Next up for the Tartans is the first round of the UAA conference tournament. They take on rivals Case Western Reserve University next weekend in Rochester, NY at 2 p.m. on Nov. 2 in the quarterfinals.

Welcome back to The Tartan’s weekly Fantasy Football recap. This responsibility fell to me, as it has for most of the semester, because I scored the fewest number of points over both Weeks 6 and 7. My descent into fantasy football humiliation continues.
In Week 6, the top and bottom team remained the same, while the other four teams switched places amongst themselves.
Slugs over TARTAN FANTASY, 112.50 to 83.98
Operations Manager Adam Tunnard’s team Slugs defeated Photo Editor Lisa Qian’s team TARTAN FANTASY, climbing to third place, while Qian’s team fell to sixth place.
Slugs was led by Tunnard’s two most consistent starters, Los Angeles Chargers running back Melvin Gordon and Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Gordon scored 33.00 points from 132 rushing yards and three touchdowns and added 18 receiving yards. Rodgers’s 28.40 points came from his 425-yard, two touchdown night.
Unfortunately, there wasn’t much Qian could’ve done to defeat Slugs, even if she had started a bench player in place of a starter on a bye week. Most of her team underperformed. Her best showing came from the Houston Texans defense, which racked up 18.00 points.
GOAT but Ironically over mmichelle123, 138.98 to 105.02
In the battle for Pillbox, Assistant Pillbox Editor Izzy Sio’s team GOAT but Ironically trounced Pillbox Editor Michelle Madlansacay’s team mmichelle123 by over 30 points. After beginning the season with three straight losses, Sio’s team has rebounded with three straight wins and into fifth place in the standings. Madlansacay’s drops to seventh place.
Even with new NFL star Patrick Mahomes, quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs, Sio’s best player remains Los Angeles Rams running back Todd Gurley, who gave a signature performance in Week 6. Gurley scored 34.50 points with 208 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, and 17 yards through the air. Mahomes was no slouch either, adding 26.98 points with 352 passing yards and two touchdowns.
Madlansacay’s team mmichelle123 boasted some solid performances from Packers wide receiver Davante Adams (25.20 points) and Baltimore Ravens running back Alex Collins (17.40 points). However, her team was let down by the 4.40 points from New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham, Jr. and zero points from New Orleans Saints kicker Wil Lutz.
futbol over newz, 140.70 to 74.10
In the biggest blowout of the week, Visual Editor Tracy Le’s team futbol absolutely obliterated News Editor Nora Mattson’s team newz. Le’s team rises to second place, while Mattson’s team moves to fourth place.
Le’s dominance was led by Chiefs wide receiver Tyrek Hill, who scored 32.20 points from 142 receiving yards and three touchdowns. Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan followed with 27.50 points from 355 yards and three touchdowns.
Similar to Qian’s situation in her matchup, there wasn’t much Mattson could have done to defeat Le. Save for Giants running back Saquon Barkley, who scored 28.90 points, and Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker, who scored 16 points, the rest of Mattson’s team simply had a down week.
Last Manning Standing over Gin and Bear It, 81.51 to 67.54
On trend with the rest of the season, my team Gin and Bear It lost, this time to Publisher Caleb Miller’s team Last Manning Standing. Miller’s team remains at the top of the standings, while I remain stuck in the cellar.
Over half of Miller’s team scored less than 10 points (including Saints running back Alvin Kamara with zero on his bye week), but Last Manning Standing didn’t need much to beat my team. A strong performance from Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz gave his team 24.52 points from 278 passing yards and three touchdowns.
On my team, Pittsburgh Steelers running back James Conner put up strong numbers to score 24.90 points, but other than that highlight, the rest of my team disappointed. Of the seven offensive starters, kicker, and defense, all but two scored in the single digits. That’s not the way to win.
Week 7 saw three of the winners from Week 6 continue their strong performances and one big upset.
GOAT but Ironically over TARTAN FANTASY, 96.92 to 60.76
Sio’s team GOAT but Ironically continues to move up the standings with its fourth consecutive win, this time over Qian’s team TARTAN FANTASY. While GOAT but Ironically jumps two spots to third place, Qian’s team stays in sixth place.
As expected, Sio’s team was led by the one-two punch of Mahomes and Gurley. It didn’t matter than nearly every other starter on her team scored fewer than 10 points. Mahomes put up another week of strong numbers, with 358 passing yards and four touchdowns, while Gurley ran for 63 yards and two touchdowns and caught the ball for 23 yards and a touchdown.
Like in Week 6, Qian’s team TARTAN FANTASY failed to score many points. The Texans defense was her highest scorer, with 14 points, and her highest offensive starter was Saints wide receiver Michael Thomas, who only scored 12.90 points.
futbol over mmichelle123, 91.86 to 86.84
In the closest matchup of the week, Le’s team futbol pulled out the win over Madlansacay’s team mmichelle123. Both remain in the same position as Week 6, with futbol in second place and mmichelle123 in seventh place.
While there were no standout performances on Le’s team, many of her starters had solid weeks that contributed to her win. Ryan led with 19.26 points from 379 passing yards and a touchdown, followed by San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle with 15.80 points from 98 receiving yards and a touchdown. Le did leave some points on the table from her bench, but it didn’t matter in the end.
Madlansacay’s team mmichelle123 improved in Week 7 from the previous week, but suffered with two strong starters on their bye weeks. Beckham, Jr. rebounded after Week 6’s zero points with 20.20 points, but the rest of Madlansacay’s team didn’t follow suit.
newz over Last Manning Standing, 106.48 to 95.40
Mattson’s team newz defeated the top team in the league, Miller’s Last Manning Standing, in this close matchup. However, both teams remain in their respective positions in the standings, with Last Manning Standing in first place and newz in fourth place.
The Rams defense posted a stout 21 points for newz, leading Mattson’s team. But her offensive starters also came through, with Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford garnering 17.58 points and Barkley 17.40 points.
Last Manning Standing also had a strong defensive performance from the New England Patriots, who scored 17 points. Wentz (18.70 points), Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Adam Thielen (17 points), and Cleveland Browns wide receiver Jarvis Landry (15.70 points) had good weeks, but they weren’t enough to overcome the two running backs who didn’t score any points.
Slugs over Gin and Bear It, 71.40 to 65.28
I really thought I had a chance to win this week, but alas, it was not meant to be. No one would know from how badly my team has played that I know the most about football as the Sports Editor. With this win, Tunnard’s team Slugs still falls to fifth place, while I remain at the bottom. I have already paid a deposit for the rest of the season.
Slugs’s top players, Rodgers and Gordon, both scored zero points (with Rodgers on a bye), but other players stepped up to help Slugs get the win. Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt led the way with 32.10 points from a haul of 86 rushing yards, a rushing touchdown, 55 receiving yards, and two receiving touchdowns.
None of my starters scored zero points this week, but the New York Jets defense did score minus-3 points. Five of the seven offensive starters scored below seven points, wasting a 15.60-point week from Denver Broncos running back Phillip Lindsay.
Next week, Le’s team futbol takes on Sio’s red-hot team GOAT but Ironically, Tunnard’s team Slugs tries to take down Miller’s team Last Manning Standing, which remains at top of the standings, Mattson’s team newz and Madlansacay’s team mmichelle123 go head-to-head, and I will continue my search for a second win against Qian’s team TARTAN FANTASY.

The Pittsburgh Penguins improved to 6–1–2 on Sunday night after a 5-0 shutout win in Vancouver. The Pens went into their Canadian road trip with several questions about the team’s overall strength and ability to play a 2-way defensive game, but, after winning all four games of the 11-day trip, most of those questions have been put to bed.
The Penguins, through their first few games, looked uninterested in playing on both ends of the ice. The whole team looked like they weren’t going to be able to hold onto a one or two goal lead. The Pens’ style of play will always have the team more likely to give up an odd-man rush, but they weren’t showing any kind of sense late in games where they held the lead. They were sloppy in the defensive zone, as well, and were unable to break out of the zone well.
With Justin Schultz out, the strength of the Penguins’ blue line was under scrutiny. Olli Maatta and Jack Johnson were underperforming, both of them having rough starts to the season. They seemed to get caught out of position every time they were on the ice through the first stretch of games, and the two defensemen needed to change something about their game.
Other than that, however, the first pairing of Kris Letang and Brian Dumoulin had looked incredible, and the other two bottom pairing guys in Jamie Oleksiak and rookie Juuso Riikola have played like solid bottom 4 defensemen. The issue really was looking like forwards not wanting to play hard in their own defensive zone.
That changed in Toronto. The Penguins met the red-hot Maple Leafs after coming off two rough overtime losses against Montreal and Vancouver. From the way the Pens were playing defense, and the way the Leafs were scoring from the start of the season, it had all the signs of another early-season blowout, similar to last season’s 10–1 loss against the Chicago Blackhawks.
However, the Pens buckled down. They got an early power play, Evgeni Malkin snuck a shot underneath the skate of Leafs goaltender Frederik Andersen, and then the team played defense. The Pens kept the entire Maple Leafs squad off the board, with goalie Matt Murray registering his first shutout since the first round of the playoffs last season. The Leafs pulled their goalie early, and Evgeni Malkin went to work on the empty net, scoring another goal thanks to a lucky bounce off a Leafs player, and then assisted on the Pens’ third goal of the night by making a nice pass to Kris Letang, who finished Toronto off with a second empty netter.
That victory proved that the Pens were still an elite team, when the whole team committed to playing the game the right way, like head coach Mike Sullivan had been preaching after each of the losses. Jack Johnson had a great game and everyone went back home happy.
The Pens moved on to Edmonton next, where things almost fell apart. Neither team looked like they wanted to play defense, and the game went into overtime. Sidney Crosby scored a highlight reel goal on the backhand in the 3v3, undressing Ryan Strome and finishing with a sick backhand. The boys didn’t look great, but a win was a win, and the Oilers always seem to make games against the Penguins interesting.
After finishing in Edmonton, the Pens came knocking on Calgary’s door, and they kicked it in. The Pens routed the Flames, scoring nine goals and allowing one. It would’ve been Murray’s second shutout of the road trip, if not for a James Neal shot that came off his stick so slowly that it took Murray by surprise. Derek Grant, replacing Daniel Sprong, and Chad Ruhwedel, replacing Riikola, both made their first starts of the season, and although neither one of them managed to get on the scoring sheet (the only other penguin who didn’t register a point was Carl Hagelin), the two played a great game. It was a statement win from the team. Calgary played some of the worst defense I’ve ever seen that night, and the Pens took advantage.
That brings us to Saturday’s game against the Canucks. Derrick Brassard was out for the Penguins, resting a nagging lower body injury, which allowed Daniel Sprong to get back into the lineup. The Penguins had a rocky start in the first period, where the Canucks put a good deal of pressure on, trapping the Pens in their defensive zone for almost half the period. They managed to get out of the first without allowing a goal, however, thanks in part to some saves by backup goalie Casey DeSmith.
In the second period, Phil Kessel got the Pens on the board first, tucking in a rebound from an Olli Maatta point shot. The captain followed that up, finishing with another backhander after a nifty little passing play from Jake Guentzel and Dominik Simon. The Pens were rolling and had all the momentum going into the third. Fourteen minutes in, Evgeni Malkin scored his fourth and fifth goals of the year in just under a minute. The first was a one-timer from the right side of the net, assisted by Daniel Sprong, who sent Malkin a beautiful shot-pass that he neatly deposited behind Canucks goalie Jacob Markstrom. His second was classic Malkin. He skated into the slot on the rush, received a pass from Phil Kessel, then fired a wrister that beat Markstrom clean. Crosby ended the night’s scoring a carbon copy of Malkin’s first goal, except this time it was Oleksiak who fired the shot pass.
One last thing about the Canucks game: right before the anthems, the Canucks held a moment of silence for the victims of the Squirrel Hill shooting, which was just a real classy move.
We’ll see these Pens in the playoffs to be sure.

Tech experts have done a great job of warning us about the potential dangers of AI and automation — nowadays, you can’t even buy a Roomba without the fear of it becoming sentient and taking over the world.
While pundits and industry figures predict that the continued advances in robotics will lead to an increasingly impersonal and jobless future, the reality is quite different. According to a study called “Robots at Work,” industrial robots increase both wages and productivity.
The study, a collaborative effort between George Graetz, a researcher at the Department of Economics at Uppsala University, and Guy Michaels, a researcher at the London School of Economics, is based on statistics from 17 different countries, looking at their incorporation of industrial robotics over the span of 14 years from 1993 to 2017. The results show that job opportunities and wages increased across the board, and the Gross National Product (GNP) of these countries increased by 0.37 percent while labor productivity increased by 0.36 percent. Out of the 17 countries studied, Germany, Italy, and Denmark saw the greatest increases.  
Robots exceed humans in a lot of ways when it comes to labor: they never tire, they don’t unionize and demand wage increases (at least, not yet), and they can do a lot of heavy lifting thanks to hydraulics, pneumatics, and other systems. With more robots on hand, companies can produce more of a given product, which in turn leads to increased profits.
History has shown us that when technological advancement combines with human ingenuity, the results are extraordinary. The automobile industry is a great example: by combining robotic workers with assembly lines, you gain the ability to produce a greater number of vehicles at higher quality in a significantly shorter amount of time, as compared to human workers alone.
It’s important to realize, however, that just because this robot-human symbiosis exists now doesn’t mean it will remain this way in the distant future. Futurists like Martin Ford have long speculated about the economic impact of robots, and it is conceivable that robotic workers will one day displace human employees, not only in the lower-skilled labor-oriented jobs but also in areas that demand higher levels of cognition and creativity, such as art or music.
Whether or not this evolution of the human-robot dynamic is ethical is a debate that rages on amongst ethicists and citizens alike, with no clear consensus in sight. Similarly, whether the day will come when humans are overtaken completely by machines is something only time will tell. So, for now, we should continue to enjoy the benefits of our robotic workers and companions, as they have objectively improved the quality of our lives manyfold. Nevertheless, we should not lose sight of what the future may bring and be ever prepared to address a deadly machine uprising.

A new study in Risk Analysis: An International Journal reveals the prevailing public opinion on how self-driving cars should make decisions in the face of an oncoming collision. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and the University of Göttingen in Germany presented participants with two plausible scenarios involving autonomous vehicles, and surveyed them on the most morally appropriate action for the autonomous system.
The first component of the study considered the choice between a self-driving car staying in its lane or swerving before braking to avoid a pedestrian. The hypothetical likelihood of colliding varied between 20, 50, and 80 percent. Approximately 75 percent of the 872 participants opted to stay in the lane before braking, and all participants opted to stay in lane when the likelihood of colliding with a bystander was given as 50 percent.
In the second experiment, a separate set of 766 participants were presented with the same scenario in retrospect — the research team wanted to determine how people’s perception of autonomous vehicles changed based on the actions the vehicles took in a collision or near-collision event. The researchers found that, regardless of the outcome, most participants always elected to stay in lane, but the number of subjects who found swerving acceptable halved when told that a collision had occurred.
According to Björn Meder, one of the researchers, the study “highlights the importance of gaining a better understanding of how people think about the behavior of autonomous vehicles under different degrees of uncertainty. The findings will help to inform policy making and public discussion of the ethical implications of technological advances that will transform society in a variety of ways.”
The key takeaway from the study is that the public is generally comfortable with autonomous vehicles defaulting to stay in their lane when facing a collision. This choice requires the least additional information to be collected by a self-driving car’s sensors and minimizes computational load for an autonomous vehicle, even if it does not always prevent loss of life. Previous studies in this area have found that people usually prefer self-driving cars to place the least value on their own passengers, but this study demonstrates that both values can coexist in an effort for autonomous vehicles to protect passengers and bystanders.
Ethics concerning self-driving cars are becoming an increasingly pertinent field, as automobile and tech companies race to build complex autonomous systems without a clear moral direction. Earlier this year, a crash involving one of Uber Technologies Inc.’s self-driving cars killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona. The vehicle did not perform an emergency brake until 1.3 seconds before the impact, even though it could have come to a complete stop in 3 seconds. A federal investigation that suspended Uber's permit to operate self-driving vehicles found that the system had relied on radar technology to determine when to stop, instead of making a default decision in an emergency. Perhaps incorporating the results of studies like this one would allow autonomous vehicles to make morally acceptable decisions to minimize risks to humans.

Roughly half of the stars visible in the 1990s can no longer be seen in Pittsburgh’s night sky. The stars aren’t going anywhere — so why can’t we see the Milky Way?
Light pollution — the presence of artificial light that interferes with the natural darkness of nighttime — is on the rise in Pittsburgh. 
The Pittsburgh Chapter of the International Dark Sky Association met on Carnegie Mellon’s campus on Oct. 22 to discuss several projects to evaluate light pollution in Pittsburgh — notably, a grant received by two Carnegie Mellon faculty members to map the distribution of light pollution in the city.
Light pollution has subtle but damaging effects. Primarily, it interferes with natural rhythms based on light and darkness — everything from disrupting human sleep cycles and changing the amount of melatonin our bodies produce to confusing nocturnal animals and impeding their mating cycles. However, these effects are not well understood, in part due to a shortage of comprehensive scientific data on light pollution.
As previously reported in The Tartan, Stephen Quick of the School of Architecture’s Remaking Cities Institute and Diane Turnshek of the physics department will lead a project using quadcopter drones to create a high-resolution light pollution map of Pittsburgh, as the city seeks to evaluate the light pollution impact of new street lamps. In addition to the International Dark Sky Association, Quick and Turnshek will be working with the City of Pittsburgh and the Amateur Astronomers Association of Pittsburgh to implement the project and raise awareness for issues of light pollution within the city.
The chapter is also coordinating the creation of “before” and “after” camera photos of Pittsburgh’s night sky by collecting photos from several decades ago and recreating them in the same places around the city. 
While large-scale light pollution surveys have existed for years, it’s been difficult to study the local effects of light pollution because measurements are usually taken from satellites. These data are too low-resolution to be useful for a single city trying to determine highly localized light pollution hotspots.
“Many researchers are waiting for a good lighting survey of the city to put to use in their studies,” reads the Metro21 grant. “This type of survey has never been done before at the 10-meter resolution we are proposing... Pittsburgh will be first.”
In addition to initiatives gathering scientific data, the chapter’s other goal is “to create a cultural shift from fearing the dark to embracing it.” Members of the chapter give talks around the city and attend community events to raise awareness for light pollution and encourage participation in community initiatives. A new and unique outreach initiative will be a partnership with local literary non-profit Parsec. Aiming to facilitate the cultural shift through storytelling, the upcoming edition of Parsec’s annual fiction anthology Triangulation will consist of short stories centered around the theme Dark Skies.
Additional information about dark sky initiatives in Pittsburgh can be found at pghconstellation.com and idapgh.org.

Product management jobs are becoming increasingly popular among Carnegie Mellon graduates. For students who understand technology but may not be interested directly in coding or developing software, product management provides a unique opportunity. Product managers remain close to the development efforts but are also engaged in strategy discussions and product planning. 
Last week, I attended the Product Leadership Days conference in Gothenburg, Sweden, hosted by Tolpagorni Product Management. This conference was focused exclusively on product management, which is the practice of overseeing and leading the planning, development, deployment, and maintenance of various products. The practice of product management is typically performed by a product manager or someone with a similar title. Product managers are sometimes referred to as mini CEOs that are solely focused on a single product, or a portfolio of products, instead of an entire company. Products can run the gamut from a small application that is part of a broader software system to an entire suite of software products.
Henrik Johnsson, from Tolpagorni Product Management, led the Product Management Essentials course at the conference. This course highlighted a number of interesting and important product management lessons. One key idea is the relationship of product managers to other personnel at a company. Typically, product managers interact with people from development, research, design, marketing, sales, and executive leadership. This can become a balancing act across different divisions in a company, and product managers are responsible for maintaining the flow of the product development lifecycle. 
Day-to-day tasks of product managers can include researching product pricing, interacting with salespeople, planning new product launches, and managing the supply chain for an upcoming product development push. The varied role of the product manager guarantees that no two days are the same.
Another key lesson from the Product Management Essentials course is the use of the Three Horizons Framework for product planning. In this framework, the first horizon is a focus on operative targets. These targets can be thought of as goals that need to be accomplished in the immediate or near future. The second horizon is a focus on strategic themes, which could include updates to products or development of new products. The third and final horizon is a focus on long-term visions, such as entering new markets or developing entirely new product segments. As a product manager, these three horizons must always be in sight and in mind to enable the current product to move forward and to enable future products to succeed.
Following the Product Management Essentials course, a series of nine product managers from various industries spoke throughout the second day of the Tolpagorni Product Leadership Conference. Each speaker shared their unique perspective and how product management differed in their industry. One speaker, Molly Stevens from Uber, described her use of “insight sprints.” Similar to development sprints, insight sprints are held with research and design teams to generate new ideas for development based on customer feedback, data-driven testing, and other market-related inputs. The results of these insight sprints are eventually used by design sprints, which formulate the initial framework of a new product or product update. The output of design sprints becomes an input for development sprints, which lead to the final result. 
Another speaker, Matt LeMay, focused his remarks on the critical skills necessary for success as a product manager. Instead of the technical skills discussed during the Product Management Essentials course, Matt LeMay shared a key mantra for product management: “clarity over comfort.” It’s critically important to ensure that all parties, like developers or salespeople, are clear on important decisions and next steps. Oftentimes, clarity is sacrificed in favor of making a senior manager happy, or comfortable, by sharing information that is not quite accurate or fails to address possible risks.
In general, the role of the product manager is central to the success of a company’s products. Product managers interact with all divisions of a company to move a product through a typical lifecycle and to ensure its success during launch.

Kennywood’s Phantom Fright Nights may not be the place to be if you’re a scare enthusiast. I don’t get scared easily, but I didn’t expect to feel like I was strolling through a park while supposedly going through a vampire’s lair. I doubt that’s what people paid $40 for, or $60 if you wanted to avoid waiting in lines until midnight. Of all the pros to my Kennywood experience, the roller coaster my friends and I went on before heading home was definitely more entertaining than all the haunted houses combined. 
It’s slightly understandable that the place wasn’t as terrifying as it was marketed to be. Kennywood Park is, after all, a children’s amusement park, despite the overwhelmingly large crowd of adults and teens it drew on Friday night. The ambiance of the park was old school Halloween. Classic Halloween music played the whole night, fog machines seemed to cover every inch of the area, and the lighting was absolutely spectacular. It made for some incredible sights, such as an abandoned Merry Go Round steeped in fog and red lights making it look hauntingly beautiful. People also bustled around dressed in masks ready to scare their next poor victim that wasn’t paying attention. It was like a small Halloween town from a fairytale come to life. 
The park offered a total of seven haunted attractions. The slew of haunted houses almost merges together in my memory. The first of them was BioFear, in my opinion the best of the haunted lineup. The premise of the experience was a science lab teeming with mutants from a failed governmental research initiative. The inside was better than the description gives it credit for, and despite the hour-long wait it took to get in, we didn’t come out disappointed. A creepy woman crawling on the ground, several people jumping out from behind doors and windows, and a woman we never managed to find who was just screaming garbled words at the top of her lungs was enough to make the experience satisfactory. It was disappointing that it set higher expectations for all the haunted houses we visited afterwards. We got fast passes and ran to Villa of the Vampire and Mortem Manor just as it started to rain. In all honesty, nothing much stood out from either of them. I took more amusement from delivering sarcastic commentary to the supposedly scary people I passed, rather than finding any of them particularly terrifying. Voodoo Bayou was outdoors and there was only one moment that stuck out: a lone woman on a bridge. Kennyville Cemetery would have been a walk in the park, literally, if a man hadn’t snuck up on us and sniffed my hair. Dark Shadows, a place that had no shadows but in fact was plunged in complete darkness, was terrifying only because there were walls and no way of seeing them. 
The park markets seven haunted attractions, but only six of them seemed to fall into the ‘haunted’ category. Noah’s Ark, the final ‘haunted’ attraction was just plain fun. The floors were shaking, the speakers blasted a cacophony of animal sounds and at one point the ‘crazy path’, as they called it, cast strobe lights that were blinding enough to burn my retinas and had us laughing crazily when we stumbled out. It wasn’t scary, it wasn’t trying to be scary, and in all honesty, I think that’s what Kennywood does best. 
Overall, the ambiance at Kennywood is wonderful to get into the Halloween spirit. It’s a great place for all ages, for a daylong family trip for example, but if you truly want to be scared you’re better off watching The Shining at 1 in the morning.

This past Friday, Carnegie Mellon's all-female a cappella group, Counterpoint, hosted their annual AcaPittsburgh concert. Featuring all eight Carnegie Mellon a cappella groups and special guest, the CMU Cyphers, a cappella fans gathered to celebrate the talents of the community, while also contributing to a charitable cause. The show raised money to benefit Animal Friends, a nonprofit that, according to the organization's Facebook page, aims to "ensure the well being of companion animals, while ending overpopulation, abuse and unwarranted euthanasia." AcaPittsburgh was an exhilarating showcase of the impressive musical artistry and talents of Counterpoint, C#, Deewane, Joyful Noise, the Originals, Saans, the Soundbytes, and the Treblemakers.

There were some fairly big releases for movies this October. Let’s talk about some. 
A Star is Born
This is the fourth adaptation of a very familiar story with a cheesy title, and the directorial debut of Bradley Cooper, who also stars in the movie. And yet, by some miracle, the film not only isn’t awful, but it’s also one of the best movies to come out this year (and one of the more depressing ones). All of the acting is fantastic across the board, especially Lady Gaga as Ally and Bradley Cooper as Jackson. The dialogue is bittersweet and realistic, the development of their relationship was incredibly endearing, the cinematography was beautiful, and the music was well composed (even the pop anthems that are supposed to be bad in the context of the movie). The concert scenes, in particular, felt full of life and incredibly visceral, filmed on location in places like Coachella to get the desired effect. The film also balances the love story and Jackson’s addiction really well, while also adding in an undercurrent of commentary on what makes music special and what the industry currently lacks. Somehow at two hours and fifteen minutes, the film feels somehow shorter, as you’re transported into the lives of these people and lose all sense of time. There were some minor issues I had with elements (don’t want to spoil), but overall this film is a definite must-watch. I will add that if you cry easily while watching films, bring a box of tissues. 
First Man
For some reason, this film was considered to be emotionless and not patriotic by a lot of people, but they must have been watching a different movie. This is a very personal portrait of Neil Armstrong, and a fascinating exploration of American Exceptionalism in the 1960s. What made this movie stand out was how laser-focused it was on Armstrong. For example, in the climactic scene where the rocket was taking off, the film didn’t ever cut back to the control room. Instead, it focused on Armstrong’s face the whole time, which added a personal touch to the scene that made it more intense and more fun to watch. Every technical aspect was on point in this film: Ryan Gosling was fantastic as Neil Armstrong, all the characters were very fleshed out and weren’t turned into caricatures, and while some of the pacing was a little off in the second act, it was all made up for by probably one of the best movie endings of the year. Damien Chazelle, whose previous two movies were La La Land and Whiplash, continues to prove himself as a talented force and one of the best directors working today. I can’t really say much more about this movie, but definitely try to see this in theaters because it’s an incredible experience
Halloween
I will say that I did not find this movie creepy or scary like the original 1978 classic, but it is definitely the best Halloween sequel out of all of them (and there have been many). This new sequel simplifies the entire timeline of the franchise by removing every other previous film from the continuity apart from the original. Taking place forty years after the first film, the film is about protagonist Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) having to finally face down Michael Myers once and for all after he escapes and returns to Haddonfield, Illinois (again). The film has several interesting elements at play that definitely elevate it from being a completely generic sequel. It explores the trauma of Laurie Strode in an interesting manner, showing just how damaged and paranoid she has become after the events of the first film. Jamie Lee Curtis reprises her role and it is a treat to see her play this character again as a more hardened individual. There were many moments that paid homage to the original film that were incredibly satisfying, and all the kills in this film were fairly savage. However, there are a few big issues with this movie. The first was that there are some really annoying side characters, such as Laurie’s daughter and her husband, and Michael Myers' doctor, who had the most irritating subplot in the movie that led to a terrible plot twist. The second really big issue was that it didn’t really have a sense of dread like the original because of some really inconsistent editing. The creepiness of the first film was that the film utilized the background of shots very effectively and held the shots for long stretches of time to give the feeling of paranoia and of Michael lurking in every corner. This new film does some of that, but it’s very inconsistent with shots often cutting too quickly. It seems like a nitpick, but editing and cinematography are incredibly important in creating a sense of tone and atmosphere, especially in the horror genre. But overall, the film was a good time, and it’s definitely a fun watch with some friends. 
Venom
Venom, or as Eminem so eloquently put it in his cringeworthy song, “Vinummmm, Vinummm, Vinummm,” was, to quote the movie itself, “a turd in the wind." I frankly have no idea why audiences gave this a pass. This is about as bad as The Amazing Spider-Man movies with Andrew Garfield, which makes sense since one of the producers and one of the writers worked on those movies. I don’t understand how Sony can’t just hire good writers, good directors, or a good crew for any of their big budget films. The only good thing about this movie was Tom Hardy, who plays Eddie Brock and voices the Venom symbiote, and the entertaining relationship between Eddie and Venom. Otherwise, everything else is a mess. Every other actor seems to be self-aware that this is a paycheck movie, so their performances are embarrassing to watch. It’s just another generic story of a big corporate executive wanting to be a god and to create a new race of human-symbiote hybrids. On top of that, Spider-Man isn’t even in this movie, and Spider-Man is integral to the character of Venom. So because Spider-Man isn’t in it, there is just so much exposition piled into the first act to explain all of the symbiotes and all the strange explanations of how it bonds to people or what they’re like, destroying the pacing in the process. Apparently, forty minutes of this film were cut (evidently Tom Hardy’s favorite scenes) and it absolutely shows. The horror/buddy cop comedy tone didn’t work well because the writing was awful. Most of the special effects looked really bad, particularly the final fight scene between Venom and the main villain, Riot. Is it a prerequisite for every Sony movie to look like a dull nightmare? Also, why was this movie advertised as an “antihero” movie? Sure, Venom kills people and eats heads, but (spoiler alert) he ends up wanting to be a hero and fights a big villain in the end anyway. They turned Venom into a superhero. I’m gonna stop talking about this before it makes me angrier. Hand the reins to Marvel Studios and let them make a good Venom movie with Spider-Man in it.

Le Nozze di Figaro, directed by Candace Evans and conducted by Thomas W. Douglas, was an entertaining and exciting production to watch. The production was double cast, adding to the uniqueness of each show. This modern twist on the opera by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was an incredibly charming rendition.
As an audience member, one of the first things to notice — besides the incredible vocals — was the set design. The set design for the production was very memorable; large pink walls that were off center and tilting added to the vibrant and modern twist of the show. Moving set pieces were brought in by the performers for the majority of the time, and were done so in a comedic manner to change sets, but also to advance the plot of the show.
Another notable feature was the costume design. Bright colors and funky wigs emphasized the comedy of the main characters, while black and white showcased the chorus members. The two costumes that stood out in particular were that of the Countess and the Count. The Count wore a blue wig and mustache, gold, brown, green and yellow coat, pants, shoes, shirt and a scarf that appeared somewhat checkered, while the Countess was equally as fabulous in a red wig, yellow and black striped jumpsuit with red flowers, and a multicolored corset and crinoline. The fashion of both characters influenced the way the singers played their characters. 
One thought-provoking aspect of the show was the modernization. To the audience, it appeared that the show was attempting to integrate as many current references as possible. For example, the use of computers, a short dance at the end of the show and emojis in the supertitles. While occasionally distracting, touches like the emojis were probably included for the younger members of the audience. With the arts industry constantly evolving, it was fascinating to witness such a specific reference to technology to establish greater connections with younger audience members. The emojis added to the humor for the production as a whole.
The vocal technique and characterizations of each part were done brilliantly. To the audience, it was apparent that each singer had done extensive background work, illustrated through the double cast. Although there were multiple people playing the same character on different nights, each singer had their own take of the character they were playing. As an audience member, it was interesting to watch one performer play a character one way, and another actor on another night play the same character in an entirely different way. The double casting system allows for audiences to see multiple versions of a character and get exposed to ideas that might not have been brought forward before. This was something that made the production very fun to watch.
Overall, Candace Evans, Thomas W. Douglas and the entire cast and crew of Le Nozze di Figaro, did a wonderful job constructing a new, modern, and entertaining opera. It was comical, pleasant to watch and amazing to listen to. Bravo!

There's no better way to get into the Halloween spirit than watching your classmates murder each other on stage. Not for a fight club, of course, but for the Scotch'n'Soda production of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.
To start, the singing and acting were wonderful. Matthew Johnson marched through his schemes with a steady glower that illustrated Sweeney Todd's deep resentment and fury. Kate Stargiotti played Mrs. Lovett with a desperate love that made me sympathetic to her plight. Their voices were clear and true, sweeping me along on their journey into a deeper and deeper darkness.
Zofia Majewski sang with a pure sweetness that reminded me of a warbling bird—fitting for Johanna's caged songbird character. Mark Tamvakis' Anthony was innocent and earnest, a second spot of light in an increasingly morbid musical. My disgust towards Judge Turpin was deep and visceral, and I applaud the actor, Julien Buron, even as I wish for the character to burn in hell. Nick Grosso was hilarious as the Beadle in both facial expression and tone of voice, and his slight finger waves towards the audience's yelled suggestions startled a laugh out of me every time. Toby Ragg's intense desire for gin was amusing and his initial innocence was sweet, making Joshua Fried's portrayal of his later madness all the more heartbreaking. Shaelynn Parker's portrayal of Lucy swung between loud rambling and solemn entreaties, a contrast that drove home how far the once-tender mother and wife had fallen. The ensemble was splendid, each actor shining and supporting in turn.
I also want to give special kudos to Quincy Eaton. He shone in the spotlight, performing his lines with all the bombastic showmanship fitting of Adolfo Pirelli.  Even after Pirelli’s untimely death, he drew my attention as a background character. He jumped and contorted as a madhouse resident, seemingly embracing the minor character with a wild-eyed determination and adept physical control.  
Of course, I can’t place all of the attention on the actors. The musical would’ve faltered or failed without the supreme skill of the musicians. The staging was great as well, moving the characters from scene to scene with quickness and clarity. The set complemented the characters without distracting from them, and I was absolutely delighted when the first dead body fell from the chair and disappeared down an invisible hole. The sound effects were used well, as evidenced by how hard I cringed when I first heard the crunch of the meat grinder. Finally, the lighting was fantastic, from the bright spotlight that followed crooning characters to the red lights that covered the stage floor like pools of blood. 
All in all, Scotch’n’Soda’s Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street was a fun and morbid romp through an eccentric plot. All the contributors did a wonderful job, and I applaud their efforts, even if I may never eat a meat pie again.

My sister recently came to Pittsburgh to visit me, and we were looking for a nice breakfast place downtown before we went to the North Side to explore. We decided on Bluebird Kitchen.
The Location: Bluebird has two locations in downtown Pittsburgh. We went to the one on Forbes Avenue, east of Market Square. If you’re downtown, it’s in a pretty central location to find, near several different bus lines. The interior of the cafe is modern and minimalist, with a white and blue theme all around. The counters and tabletops are patterned like marble, and bright lights hang from the ceiling to complement the natural lighting coming through the large windows. There isn’t much seating, so this is a good place to grab and go or eat around Market Square.
The Food: I ordered a frittata sandwich, while my sister got the pastrami-cured salmon sandwich. The frittata was delicious, with the sausage, tomato, potato, and goat cheese blending well with the egg in a way I didn’t expect. I also tried the salmon, which was smoked perfectly and slathered with enough cream cheese. Disclaimer: we went on Friday morning at 10 a.m., and they were almost out of food. I imagine it’s a popular place for professionals working downtown to grab breakfast. So if you want to make sure you get what you want, try to get there earlier.
The Vibe: Bluebird is modern and chill, with a relaxing vibe. I’m sure it’s busier earlier in the morning during rush hour, but I really enjoyed the open space and bright lights. 
Lit or Nah: You know what? I’m going to say it's Lit. No, Bluebird isn’t “Lit” in a traditional sense. It’s not a place to get down and have lots of fun. But it does have great food, and that’s all that matters in my book. It also had great and informative service. The only strike against it is the seating, and there is some open space that could be devoted to more tables. But I’m excited to go again the next time I’m downtown, and I'll try other things on their menu.

Dear Sujay, 
Stress from school and other things is taking a severe toll on my life and I feel like I'm losing motivation to do a lot of things. The overwhelming stress and pressure are starting to adversely affect everything I want to do, and my relationships with everyone around me. There are a few times when I actually don't feel this way, but for the most part, I just feel bad and I don't know how to deal with this. I'm trying to get help, but I also want to be able to do small things in my life to try and fix it myself. What should I do? 
Sincerely,
Some Anonymous Dude (or Dudette) 
Dear SAD,
I understand how hard it is to deal with this. It's like there is a constant weight on your chest that you can't rationalize, and it permeates every part of your life. There aren't really set things I can tell you to fix it because that's hard to do, but there are little things you can do beyond getting professional help to make it easier. First, let people in and be open about your feelings. The worst thing you can possibly do is cut yourself off from everyone around you. Tell your parents, family, and even a few of your closest friends because they will surely be willing to help and support you. You could even reach out to your academic advisor so that they can provide the help you need on the academic front. Knowing that there are people who care about you will help make you stronger, and you should never have to deal with this alone. Also remember that you aren't dragging them down, even if you feel that way. If they didn't care about you, they wouldn't be there for you. 
Another thing you can do is to try and simplify your life a little bit. Try focusing on the tasks that are most important during your day, like your work or running important errands; just try and distract yourself from your problems. Dwelling on the negative things that are going on in your life will only stress you out more, and make you less productive during the day. Also take breaks, and do things that you actually enjoy doing! You need to give attention to your mental and physical wellbeing. And if any one task get's too overwhelming, just stop doing it for the time being and try working on something else. That is totally ok. 
I cannot stress enough the importance of focusing on yourself and not being afraid to ask for help when you need it. You are not alone in dealing with these kinds of personal issues, even if you feel like it. It is a long and difficult process and I will not sugarcoat that fact, but don't let that discourage you. To paraphrase Father Lantom's quote from Daredevil, keep in mind that everything will turn out fine in the end, and if it's not fine, then it's not the end.
Your friend,
Sujay

A group of fifteen students gathered in the Simmons Auditorium in the Tepper Quad last Monday for a moderated debate about the Singapore Summit of U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. While eating Chipotle under a projector displaying larger-than-life images of the U.S. and North Korean flags, the small audience watched moderator Dan Silverman of the Institute for Politics and Strategy (IPS) prompt his colleague Dani Nedal and visiting professor Aaron Friedberg to share their thoughts on the diplomatic effort.
The unprecedented summit, which took place in June after a brief cancellation period, was intended to usher in new diplomatic relations between the two countries, mainly by denuclearizing North Korea and halting provocative joint-military operations between the U.S. and South Korea. Each speaker was chosen for their expertise on the summit.
Nedal is a postdoctoral fellow at the IPS who teaches a number of undergraduate courses. His work has a special focus on international security and nuclear weapons. Friedberg is a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University and served the U.S State Department from 2003 to 2005. His work has mainly been focused on U.S. foreign policy regarding East Asian countries.
For the students who organized the event, choosing experts was easy. Chandler Stacy, a sophomore in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, is currently taking a class with Dr. Nedal. “When we decided on this topic, I knew Dani would have experience in this field and that we would get a good discussion out of it,” he said.
The “we” he’s referring to is the campus chapter of the Alexander Hamilton Society (AHS), a national nonprofit which sponsors political debates on college campuses around the U.S. Dr. Friedberg is a co-founder and an official speaker for AHS, so when the chapter reached out to him, he agreed.
The push to start a chapter at Carnegie Mellon came from Dr. Kiron Skinner, director of the Institute for Politics and Strategy and founder of the Washington Semester Program, who is currently on leave. “Dr. Skinner reached out to all of the IRP students, and we thought it sounded really interesting,” said Nick Bellante, a member of the AHS executive board.
The organization’s debate goals seem well suited to Dr. Skinner’s research interests, which include “The inherent tension among political conservatism, political liberalism, and libertarianism.” She was appointed Director of Policy Planning at the U.S. State Department in August and is currently on leave from Carnegie Mellon to work in Washington.
The Singapore summit, Nedal and Friedberg agreed, didn’t accomplish much. Nedal called it a “vacuous statement” and Friedberg lambasted President Trump for “casting in his hand for a photo op.” With these fundamental agreements, the event proceeded much more like a conversation than a debate.
“We didn’t go for a topic that would bring a lot of divisive issues to the table,” said Millie Zhang, president of the young chapter. Her vision is to reduce partisanship in political discourse on campus. “We’re trying to foster discussion where it’s constructive,” she explained. “Politics is a really hard topic for most students to talk about.”
Politics is personal, and as the student body of U.S. higher education becomes more diverse, a long-overdue questioning of traditional discourse is taking place. Student protests opposing conservative speakers on campuses across the country have put pressure on school officials to think more deeply about the opposing thorns of free speech and hate speech: one person’s political opinion could marginalize their classmates’ lives and experiences. Topics like police brutality, reproductive rights, gun control, and immigration rights make this issue painfully clear because so many students have personal experiences with such topics, making it impossible to separate personal struggle from political opinions.
Officially recognized in September, the Carnegie Mellon chapter is the newest addition to the AHS network, which has chapters at 36 schools and three professional offices in New York, Washington D.C., and San Francisco. The national organization was founded in 2010 by Dr. Friedberg and his colleague Dan Blumenthal, director of Asian Studies at conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute. Though most of its leadership is conservative, AHS identifies itself as a nonpartisan organization, hosting debates on topics such as the economy, foreign policy, and national security, all of which came into play during Monday’s debate.
The main point on which Nedal and Friedberg disagreed was on how to move forward from the summit: Nedal advocated for more South Korean and Japanese involvement, while Friedberg maintained that continued American pressure on North Korea is the best way to guarantee denuclearization.
With a subject so removed from most students’ daily lives, their opinions were met with quiet inquiry from the audience. Zhang wants to continue this kind of dialogue in the future: “Our main goal is to have more political discussions on these issues,” she said. That way, students can be involved in debates without the intense personal stakes that domestic topics raise.
For more information about the AHS at Carnegie Mellon, email Millie Zhang at milliez@andrew.cmu.edu.

On the morning of Saturday, Oct. 27, a gunman walked into the Tree of Life Synagogue and opened fire. 11 people were killed, making this possibly the deadliest attack motivated by anti-Semitism in the history of the United States, according to the Anti-Defamation League.
Tree of Life is located on the corner of Wilkins and Shady Avenue, just one mile from Carnegie Mellon campus. Members of the Carnegie Mellon community were shocked to see the cameras of the world pointed at Pittsburgh, the place they call home. To many, the reality of this tragedy is just beginning to sink in.
At 9:55 a.m., police and FBI from multiple zones and jurisdictions rushed to the scene. Two police officers and two SWAT officers were hit by bullets. They are in stable condition.
About an hour later, the gunman surrendered after being hit in a shootout with the police. The suspect has been identified as Robert Bowers, a 46-year-old white male who is a resident of Pittsburgh. He was armed with an AR-15 and three handguns. It is believed he acted alone. The Director of Pittsburgh Public Safety, Wandell Hirsh, emphasized at a briefing that, “At this time there appears to be no active threat to the community.”
In a Saturday news briefing, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf confirmed that the shooting is being investigated by the FBI as a hate crime. Some witnesses reported that the gunman shouted “All Jews must die” before opening fire. Bowers posted violent anti-Semitic rhetoric on Gab.com, directing hate at Jewish organizations such as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), a group that works to resettle refugees.
Governor Wolf told Pennsylvanians after the attack that “Any attack against a community of faith in Pennsylvania is an attack against every community of faith in Pennsylvania.”
Robert Jones of the FBI asked for the public’s patience: “In the next weeks, we will look at every aspect of the suspect’s life.” He added that this was the “most horrifying” crime scene he’s seen in his 22 years of service.
Tree of Life Synagogue belongs to the Conservative Movement of Judaism and is located in the historically Jewish neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, which borders the Carnegie Mellon campus. Squirrel Hill is home to significant Conservative, Reform, and Orthodox congregations, and Tree of Life was founded 150 years ago.
A member of the Carnegie Mellon community was among the worshipers slain in the shooting. Joyce Feinberg was the spouse of Stephen E. Fienberg, a professor of Statistics and Social Science at Carnegie Mellon, who passed away in Dec. 2016. Ms. Fienberg had been attending services at Tree of Life every morning for over a year to mourn her late husband.
Newly-inaugurated University President Farnam Jahanian said, in an email to the entire campus, “At times like these we are reminded of our deeply rooted connections to Pittsburgh, which itself was built by people of many different faiths and backgrounds.”
The shooting took place on the Jewish Sabbath, a traditional day of worship and rest that is central to Jewish life. In the basement, a Bris was being held to celebrate the birth of a new baby. Many Conservative and Orthodox Jews walk to synagogue to attend service every Saturday morning.
Because many groups of Orthodox Jews do not use electronic devices during the Sabbath, some did not find out about the tragic news until Saturday night.
This hate-motivated shooting is of a magnitude that has not been perpetrated against the Jewish community in decades and is reflective of a rise in American anti-Semitism and gun violence. A recent report published by the Anti-Defamation League found that anti-Semitic incidents increased by 57 percent in 2017.
In an interview with CNN, President Trump criticized the lack of security presence at the synagogue and called for the death penalty. He voiced that shooting had “little to do” with gun laws. “If there was an armed guard they would have been able to stop him.” He added, “it’s a shame we have to think like this.”
In an article published by The New Yorker, Benjamin Wallace Wells argued plainly that the causes for such violent acts “are the toxic politics of the President, and the racist, nationalist fervor that has been inflamed by his rise, and the success and the militancy of the gun lobby.” Wells noted that this was the second attempted hate-based massacre in just 72 hours. On Wednesday, a white man in Jefferson, Kentucky, shot and killed two black customers in a Krogers, just 10 to 15 minutes after attempting to enter a predominantly black First Baptist Church.
The Carnegie Mellon community was alerted promptly of police activity at 10:28 a.m. on Saturday. All university sponsored events were canceled. Among the planned events were the Homecoming football game and the College of Fine Arts’ Beaux Arts Ball. Carnegie Mellon students were asked to remain inside. The Shelter-in-Place warning was not lifted until noon.
Some professors postponed assignments, allowing students to take the weekend to reflect and mourn. 
At 6 p.m. on Saturday, nearly 2,000 community members gathered in central Squirrel Hill for a vigil organized by Jewish students of Taylor Allderdice High School. Allderdice is commonly attended by residents of Squirrel Hill. A mass of people filled the streets and sidewalks adjacent to the intersection of Forbes and Murray. The students led them in Misheberach, a Jewish song for the sick and healing. A grey sky loomed overhead as mourners bowed their heads in a moment of silence.
Students from Allderdice talked about how this tragedy would impact their Jewish experience, examined their role as young people, and led the mourners in songs and chants, including a chant that seemed to fluctuate between “vote” and “hope” as it echoed through the gathering.
At 7 p.m., Chabad, Hillel, and Alpha Epsilon Pi (AEPi) came together to host a vigil on Carnegie Mellon campus, in the Center for Diversity. Nearly 100 students and faculty put their arms around one another and swayed as Rabbi Shlomo, of Chabad, led Havdalah, bringing the Sabbath to a close.
Provost Laurie Weigert told students that professors had been made aware of the events, and asked to provide some leniency. She voiced that “In times like these, we need to come together.” Rabbi Shlomo urged students to reach out to Chabad, Hillel, and AEPi: “Our doors are always open.”
Small conversations eventually emerged from a harkening silence. AEPi moved a planned barbecue event to the vigil, and attendees lined up for chicken and steak. After fifteen minutes, the atmosphere became friendly and intimate. People were talking loudly to one another. It felt like a community. Nate Chevan, a Senior in Chemical Engineering, said “Being together, this is what Judaism is about.”

This past Friday, Oct. 26, Farnam Jahanian was officially inaugurated as the 10th President of Carnegie Mellon University. Students received a day off from school Friday in celebration of the inauguration, as well as the celebration of Homecoming Weekend.
The celebration started in the Cohon Center, where a catered breakfast opened up at 9 a.m. The line extended from the Lee Lobby, where the food was served, to well down the hallway, past the wall of Cohon Center donors.
The students, professors, and university staff in attendance cheerfully collected their breakfast under the Lee Lobby Chihuly art piece and crowded around small tables, everyone adorned with thistle-and-plaid necklaces.
At 9:30 a.m., the inauguration fanfare began. The inauguration took place in the Wiegand Gymnasium, where the basketball hoops were folded up and the woodgrain was traded for grey carpet. Modernized plaid drapes hung in front of the cinder block walls and leather fold out chair seats covered the floor of the gym, all facing a huge stage at the front.
As guests filed in, a classical orchestration hummed through the PA system. In attendance were the family of President Jahanian, as well as countless community leaders, faculty, and staff, though very few students. Many students who wanted to see the inauguration did so at campus watch parties that streamed the events.
People rushed to sit down as the first procession of bagpipers, formally known as the Carnegie Mellon University Pipes and Drums, led robed faculty toward their seats in the front of the gym. Moments later, the “esteemed platform group” was led again by the Pipes and Drums onto the stage. Last in this elite group, comprised of senior faculty, the board of trustees, and high ranking administrators, was President Farnam Jahanian.
Holding a large ceremonial chromed thistle, Faculty Marshall and Howard Heinz University Professor Baruch Fischhoff spoke first, declaring the beginning of the ceremony. A variety of speakers then gave remarks, including the first keynote speaker Keith Block, co-CEO of Salesforce and Heinz College alumni, who commended the “vision, passion, and focus” of President Jahanian, optimistically touting the future of the university.
After Block’s remarks, Tamara Tunie, College of Fine Arts alum, led a swaying group of musical theatre students in singing “How Can I Keep From Singing,” accompanied by Gary Kline, College of Fine Arts professor.
The second keynote speaker was Martha Pollack, President of Cornell University as well as friend and colleague of President Jahanian. They had known each other since working together as faculty members at the University of Michigan. Quoting Hopper from “A Bug’s Life,” she half-jokingly reminded Jahanian that, as president, “everything is your fault,” but also expressed optimism in his leadership.
Later, Jahanian was officially crowned the President of Carnegie Mellon University with the award of a stylized thistle from Carnegie Mellon community leaders, a presentation of the charter of the University, and a detailed presidential collar. The collar had a pendant depicting the thistle with the Andrew Carnegie quote and campus motto “My heart is in the work” above it.
Farnham's inaugural address focused on Carnegie Mellon’s groundbreaking legacy, and how he intends to add to it in the future. He spoke on the incredible power that education has to change lives, and among others referenced the computer science pioneer Grace Hopper, whom he paraphrased: “The most dangerous phrase in the English language is, ‘we've always done it this way.’”
He spoke directly to Carnegie Mellon students, saying “you are my most important motivation,” and thanked them “for entrusting us with the most important chapter of your lives.” Jahanian paused mid-speech after losing track of the presidential-style teleprompter, and while finding his place in a printed copy quipped, “I didn’t realize this speech was so long!” President Jahanian concluded his speech by restating the University's four core values: integrity, knowledge, compassion, and respect, and channeling Andrew Carnegie's statement “My heart is in the work.”
Students from the School of Music passionately sang the Alma Mater as a final note of the event.
The inauguration, steeped in tradition, futuristic optimism, and plaid ornamentation, concluded at around 11:45 a.m. The Pipes and Drums procession again led the platform elite, this time off of the stage, chrome thistle in the hands of Faculty Marshall Fischhoff, followed by a cheerful President Jahanian and the rest of the group.
After the inauguration, attendees were encouraged to walk to the official inauguration picnic held in the grand, very level, temperature-treated, glass-walled tent on the College of Fine Arts lawn. The picnic featured free meals for members of the community, faculty, attendees of the inauguration, as well as university students. Many students seemed thrilled at the prospect of free food, like those who woke up for the breakfast in the Cohon Center.
Though the picnic was scheduled to run through 1:30 p.m., some students who arrived late were disappointed to find that they had run out of food. Jackie Chou, a junior design major, arrived at 1 p.m.: “I was pissed. I grabbed two LaCroix and left.”
There was some criticism of the inauguration extravagance amongst the student body. Gabriel Garcia, a Junior vocal performance major who sang the Alma Matter in the inauguration, questioned why the Carnegie Mellon student body was not more involved in the ceremony. “If this is an event for the future of the university, then why was the future not involved?”
Most heavily scrutinized was the tent. Though the Carnegie Mellon University Marketing and Communications informed The Tartan that a “small group of trustees covered the cost of the tent,” most students assumed that it was paid for by their tuition. After witnessing its construction for over two weeks, from the scaffolding system to the entirely glass walls, many students found it questionable that it was only used for a dinner, cocktail party, and a picnic, before being rapidly deconstructed.

This Saturday, Carnegie Mellon University students, the Pittsburgh community, the nation, and the world were alarmed to hear of yet another mass shooting in the United States. At the Tree of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill North, just a mile from Carnegie Mellon’s campus, a gunman opened fire on the congregation after shouting “all Jews must die,” shooting 20 and killing 11.
Events like these are hard to comprehend from afar. But for many, waking to the sound of response vehicle sirens, being warned to stay inside by Carnegie Mellon Police’s email alert system, and receiving calls from loved ones asking if we were okay, the gravity of the situation became more comprehensible. 
This crime struck Squirrel Hill, a historically Jewish neighborhood in Pittsburgh located nearby Carnegie Mellon. The Jewish community in Pittsburgh is small, and many of its members study or work here at Carnegie Mellon. A tragedy of this scale in our small community is sure to touch many, and it is important to reach out to those around you to give and receive support.
Incidents like Saturday's are becoming more and more normalized in today’s society. A media panic ensues, the perpetrator's motivation is revealed, response pieces are written, a vigil is held, and we quietly wait, hoping for something to change. Nothing does, and the cycle repeats as we become more desensitized to these horrific and inhumane acts.
Unfortunately, hate-based violence is on the rise in America, including a 57 percent increase of anti-Semitic incidents in 2017, the highest since 1979, as reported by the Anti-Defamation League. Yet how we are choosing to address this situation is far from optimal. 
The Trump administration has refused to crack down on domestic terrorism and hate crimes, despite their rise in the past years. They even considered rebranding the Department of Homeland Security’s “Countering Violent Extremism” (CVE) task force to “Countering Islamic Extremism,” thereby excluding right-wing extremism and other domestic terrorism, despite the fact that right-wing terrorism far exceeds any other ideology responsible for mass killing in the United States.
According to a U.S. Government Accountability of Office report to Congress, “of the 85 violent extremist incidents that resulted in death since September 12, 2001, far right-wing violent extremist groups were responsible for 62 (73 percent) while radical Islamist violent extremists were responsible for 23 (27 percent).” Even without the rebranding of CVE considered by the Trump administration, “Muslims and other minority groups are explicitly targeted in 85 percent of Homeland Security Department grants devoted to Countering Violent Extremism,” according to the Brennan Center for Justice.
In addition to this, on Friday, President Trump referred to the mail bombs sent to several notable critics and top government officials last week as “this ‘Bomb’ stuff,” prioritizing the political impact it would have on Republicans in the midterms rather than the fact that several prominent Americans were targeted in an act the former United States Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, called “definitely domestic terrorism.” Though President Trump later clarified and spoke out against the acts, while also denying blame for radicalizing the perpetrator, the initial response is still unsettling and follows a pattern of dodging referencing far-right violence, such as his response following the murder of activist Heather Heyer in the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville last year.
What we are seeing is clear. The Trump administration does not take the threat of right-wing terrorism as seriously as they should. While statements can appear strong on the surface, like in Trump’s initial response to the Tree of Life shooting as “far more devastating than originally thought,”, his later statements show a remarkable ability to forget the unnerving and vile acts happening on American soil.
Just after making these statements of solace and lamenting the “hate in our country,” President Trump told reporters that “this is a dispute that will always exist I suspect, but, if they had some kind of protection inside the temple, maybe it could have been a very much different situation."
If anti-Semitism, religious intolerance, or other hate-motivated violence is part of a “dispute that will always exist,” why aren’t we doing more about it? Are we really going to tell the congregation that has just been subjected to a mass-murder that more guns in their place of worship would have made everything okay?
These type of sentiments, common among those in the Trump administration, forget that violence matched with violence is not the only solution. Instead of the nonsensical idea to increase armed security in every public space in America, what if we considered a crackdown on extremism, including right-wing terrorism, not just focusing on Islamic extremism? What if we didn’t use mass shootings as political fuel for easing the application of the death penalty? What if we swallowed our pride and both-sideism and admitted that right-wing extremism is a problem in this nation?
The events of Saturday are still fresh, and we do not intend to over-politicize them. But there is a real problem in our country, and the first step in solving it is collective understanding. As for the solution, the debate is justifiably ongoing. But for the sake of all Americans, we need to change how we talk about and deal with acts of hate in our communities.

Imagine that you are arrested for making an anti-government comment. It doesn’t matter if it was serious or a joke, or if you meant any harm by it; the feds just show up at your door one day and drag you off to jail.
For those of us born and raised in the United States — a Western democracy founded on the principles of free speech, press, assembly, protest, and practice — this idea seems inconceivable. Today’s media constantly publishes content critical of the President and his administration (much to Trump’s chagrin), adolescents and adults alike crack political jokes and frequently engage in serious discussions, and late night talk shows seem incapable of being apolitical (not that that’s a bad thing).
The story, however, is quite different in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, an oil-rich monarchy whose material wealth often overshadows its moral corruption. There, activism is strictly taboo, with protesters often arrested and held captive by the state. Some are outright killed, and others are locked away forever, never to be seen again. This is all in the name of maintaining power and control at the highest levels of government — there’s no other way for an absolute monarchy to remain viable in the face of increasing globalism and rapidly spreading democratic values than to wipe out dissent wherever it may arise.
Saudi Arabia has long come under fire from the international community for its human rights violations and efforts to hide its misdeeds. However, the kingdom came under increased scrutiny recently, following the recent murder and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi, a contributing columnist for The Washington Post.
Khashoggi was living in Virginia under self-imposed exile after fleeing Saudi Arabia, fearful of being targeted by the government for siding with progressives. During his time in the U.S., he was approached on multiple occasions by operatives of the Saudi government, all trying to lure him back with promises of wealth and status, as reported by The Atlantic. Khashoggi never returned to Saudi Arabia — despite the tempting offers — but did go to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 to finalize divorce papers, officializing his separation from his ex-wife so he could marry his fiancée, as reported by BBC.
He was never seen again.
When news of his disappearance first surfaced, many feared that Khashoggi had been killed by Saudi agents. At first, Saudi Arabia denied these accusations, claiming that Khashoggi exited the consulate through a backdoor entrance. The only problem was that there was no corroborating evidence, and the international community was not satisfied.
What followed was a string of contentious negotiations between the Saudi, Turkish, and U.S. governments; an inconclusive search of the consulate facilities by a Turkish task force; the Saudis rapidly backtracking on their initial narrative, offering instead that Khashoggi was killed by rogue agents and that his death was not affiliated with the crown; and increased uncertainty for the future U.S.-Saudi relationship.
As tragic as Khashoggi’s killing is, the response from the U.S. government was especially troubling. When pressed about the disappearance of Khashoggi on live television, President Trump at first deflected, showing indifference and claiming that the incident was of lesser importance given that Khashoggi was not an actual American citizen, as reported by Time. He then continued onwards, focusing not on the loss of life and the potentially egregious actions of the Saudi government, but rather, how he would have to reconsider U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia, framing the issue economically.
The president’s comments are not surprising, with his racist history and denigration of the press, branding it as the “enemy of the people” and frequently encouraging violence against journalists at his many rallies.
But while the president’s words are nothing new, the underlying message remains disturbing: if you are of a certain ethnicity, citizenship status, or political orientation not agreeing with Trump’s vision of a xenophobic, nationalistic, and racist America, then you are less valuable. It is a soulless way to approach the task of governance and undoubtedly springs from Trump’s business background.
In the past, premeditated deaths of Americans abroad have always met with severe consequences, ones befitting of the crime. The America of yesterday seems very different from the America of today, where how much you matter to those in power depends on how much you agree with them.
This is the message that Trump, and his administration, is sending the world, and it’s dangerously emboldening for the dictatorships out there. Rather than the U.S. upholding and defending human rights on a global scale and acting as a refuge for those seeking asylum, Trump has narrowed his scope solely to the nation’s borders, even declaring himself a nationalist at a Houston rally, as reported by The New York Times. And of course, Trump isn’t going to focus on all of America, just the demographics that he cares about.
With the most powerful nation in the world becoming increasingly nationalist, countries like Saudi Arabia see it as an opportunity to do as they like, asserting their totalitarian ideologies over their citizens and crushing their opponents through any means necessary. We already see this in Russia, where enemies of Putin often don’t live to see election day, and also in China, where President Xi Jinping scrapped term limits to make himself “president for life” this March, as reported by BBC.
This sets a very dangerous precedent for progressivism around the world, making it clear that you can no longer escape the grasp of these heinous regimes. While it’s important to consider a nation’s sovereignty, it’s equally important to ensure that people, regardless of nationality and geography, are treated humanely. We as a country and as members of the international community cannot stand idly by as these voices are snuffed out.
As with many of the problems that we face, the issue originates from the top of the political pyramid, and if we hope to change anything, we must first ensure that our leaders are worldly and compassionate, not paranoid and hateful. Only by doing our part as citizens in this social contract can we ensure that the US continues as a place of safety, freedom, and growth, spreading those noble values beyond the confines of our country. After all, as The Washington Post is fond of saying, “Democracy dies in darkness.”

The midterm elections are still a week away, but voting has already begun in many parts of the country with absentee ballots and early voting. The media is calling this midterm one of the most important elections in our lifetime, yet young people still cannot find the will to vote. Instead, they make excuse after excuse for their choice to abstain.
For years, there has been a trend of young people not voting, and the upcoming midterm is no exception. Montgomery County in Clarksville, Tennessee has one of the lowest voter turnouts in the state and doesn’t seem like it’ll change anytime soon. The younger voters in Montgomery County are jaded by today’s politics. Some of them argue that politics has become too divisive and that they do not want to pick a side. Other young people defend their choice not to vote by not believing that their vote can lead to positive change.
It is important for these young voters to understand that their votes truly do count. Yes, it is true that one vote is small compared to the entire electorate, but your vote could also be one of the deciding votes that helps a candidate win. The best example of why voting matters is Conor Lamb’s special election victory in PA’s 18th district last March. Lamb won by a narrow margin of fewer than 700 votes, flipping a formerly red district blue.
Another excuse people make for not voting is that they do not 100 percent agree with a candidate’s policies. In fact, it is highly unlikely that you will agree with all of a candidate’s policies, but that does not mean that you should not vote for them if they are clearly the better choice, and will push our country towards a better future. For this upcoming midterm, it is important to note that you don’t have to agree with a candidate on everything — rather, you should vote for the candidate that you believe will uphold and protect your values.
Young college students like to justify not voting by their lack of time on election day. At first, this may seem like a fair excuse, because waiting in line at the polls can take a bit of time; however, many states offer early voting and all states offer absentee ballots. Filling out an absentee ballot takes less than five minutes, so there should be no time constraint excuse for students not voting.
Other college students and millennials say that they do not have the time to educate themselves on the candidates, so they do not feel justified in voting for someone they do not have a lot of information about. However, if these voters can take half an hour out of their day, they will find that all candidates have websites, literature, and email lists, which they can read through before the election. This is rather moralistic, but the truth of the matter is that most of the electorate is uneducated about the candidates running for office, which is why we are in our current predicament. Although this is a poor excuse to not vote, more voters should have this mindset and realize that they should do their research before voting on someone to represent them.
As someone who has interned for the Democratic Party and engaged in voter outreach, one of the most frequent responses for why young people do not vote is that they do not feel well-represented. Young potential voters argue against voting because they believe candidates only represent the older population. This is true because the majority of the older population actually votes! If young people want their opinions considered in Congress, they need to vote en masse; only then will they feel well represented.
In many Pittsburgh neighborhoods, several houses have signs in their front yards reading “vote like your future depends on it.” For many of these young voters, their futures do depend on the people we elect this midterm. The media is not wrong in saying that this could be the most consequential election of our lives. Next Tuesday, people of all ages — including college students and millennials — must vote for the people that will stand up and fight for what they hold most important.

It's easy to think that the fight for voting rights ended with the passage of the 15th and 19th Amendments, giving voting rights to African-Americans and women, respectively.  Although these rights have been secured on paper for over a century, the fight to allow all Americans the right to vote has never ended. Politicians in many states have enacted laws undermining this right by making it more difficult for certain people — mostly those with minority backgrounds — to vote. We are unfortunately reminded of this every election, and the 2018 midterms are shaping up to be no different.
Last week, North Dakota made headlines for choosing to uphold a recently-passed state law that requires proof of identification with a current residential address in order to vote. This might not seem especially draconian on the surface; after all, isn’t that just a normal ID card? However, North Dakota has a population of over 30,000 Native Americans, the majority of whom live on reservations and, as a result, lack standard mailing addresses. If no special provisions are made to allow Native Americans to vote (and as of now, one week before the elections, no such thing has happened), most of the state’s Native population will be turned away at polling places. The existence of this law might seem a little bit less suspicious if North Dakota’s Senate race wasn’t so easily tippable; in 2012, Democratic candidate Heidi Heitkamp won the election by just 2,936 votes, and just a fraction of the 30,000 potential Native American votes could change the result of the election. The recent law was passed by Republicans, who are, at the moment, fighting to replace Heitkamp this November. It’s easy to see that this is no coincidence. This doesn’t even begin to mention how preventing Native Americans from voting does nothing but perpetuate the attitude that the U.S. government has shown towards the indigenous population, apathetic at best and hostile at worst.
But the story of voter suppression in the 2018 midterms didn’t start in North Dakota. The week before last, Georgia appeared in the news for even more blatant and egregious voter suppression. Georgia is also the site of another potentially-pivotal election; their race for the governorship is currently rated as a toss-up, with a difference in the polls of only 0.8 percent between the two front-runners. Again, it’s difficult to give state officials in Georgia the benefit of the doubt after it was discovered that 53,000 voter registration applications had been denied by Georgia’s secretary of state. These applications were held back because they failed to comply with the state’s “exact match” law. This means that minor discrepancies in, for example, driver’s license numbers, between what is written on a registration form and what is present in state records are enough to invalidate the entire form. Similarly to North Dakota, the circumstances in which this is happening make this case all the more suspicious. Brian Kemp, who oversees elections in Georgia as the Secretary of State, also happens to be the Republican candidate for governor this year. And the 53,000 applications that were denied mostly belonged to African-Americans, who generally are more likely to vote for the Democratic party. This doesn’t take much close reading: a politician is abusing his power to tip an election in his (and his party’s favor) by infringing on the constitutional rights of his constituents. Yet again, this voter suppression keeps the cycle of African-American under-representation going strong.
Georgia and North Dakota are two standout examples of voter suppression taking place in 2018, but they’re far from the only ones. Arkansas, Missouri, and New Hampshire have passed new laws in the last two years making it harder for people to vote. Now, you might think that we should be more stringent about who gets to vote; after all, we don’t want people who aren’t supposed to be voting illegally influencing our elections. But this fear simply isn’t supported by any facts. Voter fraud is essentially nonexistent, despite politicians (all the way up to our President) consistently using it as justification to make voting difficult. A 2014 study in The Washington Post examined one billion votes cast between 2000 and 2014 and found only 31 instances of genuine fraud. We hear claims from President Trump that three million undocumented immigrants voted in the 2016 presidential election, but another examination by The Washington Post found exactly four cases of certain voter fraud. 
We remember from U.S. History classes the poll taxes and literacy tests that kept recently-freed slaves from voting in the 1890s and 1900s. But unlike these plainer forms of discrimination, like Jim Crow laws, we never got rid of voter suppression. If anything, voter suppression requires even more attention now, since the methods our representatives use to keep people away from polls are far more covert than they were a century ago. Voter suppression strikes at the heart of already marginalized and under-represented communities. If anything is to change, those of us who can vote must use our position of relative power and privilege to lift up those who aren’t being heard.

Three days after a white supremacist shot dead two black men at a Kroger store in Kentucky, an anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist attacked a peaceful congregation in the Tree of Life Jewish Synagogue, killing 11 people and injuring six. 
Most articles reporting the shooting mentioned the Gab.com posts of the shooter, who I do not wish to dignify by naming. Specifically, they reported that he’d posted on Gab about his intent to murder minutes before the shooting began. This is the first I heard of Gab, a social media network that, according to Wikipedia, promotes “free speech.” What I saw instead was that it promoted blatant hate speech, racism, sexism, anti-Semitism, and white supremacy. Hours after the shooting, I saw posts on Gab that praised the shooter and warned Jewish people to beware. I tried finding a button to report them, but one didn’t exist. Gab claims the reason is “free speech.” 
Earlier this week, The Washington Post reported that a New Jersey woman, Koeberle Bull, may have stopped a school shooting from taking place after she notified the police about racist and threatening messages she’d received from a man who was planning shootings at two Kentucky schools.
On the other hand, after a radical Trump fan sent pipe bombs to various critics of Trump — including a former President, a Former Secretary of State, a cable news network, and a billionaire — political commentator Rochelle Ritchie revealed that she’d reported his Twitter account to the social media giant earlier this month, after he’d sent her threatening messages. Twitter had taken no action.
We have two cases here: a successful reporting that prevented a tragedy from taking place and a report that the social media organization didn’t take seriously, resulting in mass anxiety and fear. In both cases, we had the option of reporting hate speech.
And then we have the third scenario — like Gab — which, under the garb of free speech, actually promotes hate speech. Free speech is important. Free speech is what lets any civilized nation flourish. But what if, under the name of free speech, people spread hatred and vitriol towards other people? 
When I first saw some of the most popular posts on Gab at the moment of my opening it, I was shaken, shocked, and disgusted. Their views were evil, celebrating the shooting and the deaths of innocent people.
These users must be punished. Gab must be punished. Some may think it’s wrong to punish the whole platform for the sins of some of its users, especially when Facebook and Twitter face no consequences, even though they have the same problem of hate speech on their platform. But what if the platform outright refuses to penalize its users for the hate-filled content that they publish? When you allow racist, sexist and anti-Semitic comments to be published on your platform and go viral, you are legitimizing them. Free speech lets people speak their minds and lets those whose thoughts may be from different ends of the political, religious, philosophical spectrums express themselves without fear of governmental repercussions, not for people who actively call for genocide. 
Soon after the Charlottesville attack in which a white supremacist drove a car through a protesting crowd, killing Heather Heyer, it was revealed that the attack may have been planned on Discord servers which provided these right-wing terrorists with the necessary anonymity and little regulation. Discord later started taking down servers that espoused Nazi ideology and white supremacy.
People will have radical ideas on issues. Everybody needs to have a chance to express themselves, even if we do not agree with their ideas. But public platforms should conform to community standards.
Laws are essentially codified ethics. Ethics are based on a consensus in society. We cannot continue to refer to ourselves as “civilized” if we refuse to uphold the same body of laws that grant us free speech. 
The fact that Gab doesn’t have an option to report hateful content means that it should be taken down. There are other platforms for free speech, ones that ensure that its users are provided with a safe environment where they aren’t threatened for expressing their views.
Any content that explicitly threatens harm towards another individual or a specific group should be thought of as hate speech, and the content on Gab embodies everything that’s wrong with our society. There is a line between free speech and hate speech, and it’s not thin at all. 
Please note that I haven’t mentioned the name of any perpetrators in this article. Their names do not matter. It’s the names of those who perished that matter, those who lost their lives to these awful and violent acts. We should remember their names and fight to make this world a better place.
Thoughts and prayers are not going to bring people back. We need real change, and those with the power to make changes should act now before another tragedy like this takes place.
