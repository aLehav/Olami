Junior running back Patrick Blanks was the star in last Friday’s game, leading the Tartans to a 35–14 victory over the Kenyon College Lords.
Blanks scored his first of three touchdowns on the opening play from scrimmage on a 56-yard run. The next scoring drive started with 6:24 left in the first quarter when the Tartans went 47 yards, ending with a six-yard run by junior fullback Jake Nardone to bring the Tartans’ lead to 14–0.
Junior Nick Karabin recovered a fumble early in the second quarter, leading to two big passes by sophomore quarterback Rob Kalkstein to sophomore wide receiver Tim Kikta to move the ball downfield. Blanks would finish the drive with his second touchdown of the night, a five-yard run.
At the end of the first half, after a 22-yard connection from Kalkstein to Kikta, Blanks scored his third touchdown on a 10-yard run to give the Tartans a 28–0 halftime lead.
The Lords scored to open the gates in the second half, after a 46-yard touchdown drive.
The Tartans quickly responded, scoring on a Kalkstein pass to first-year wide receiver Timothy Swanson for a 26-yard touchdown pass.
In the fourth, the Lords would score once more, driving 80 yards to score a touchdown.
Blanks had a career night, scoring three touchdowns on 147 yards rushing. Nardone added 122 yards on 16 carries and one touchdown. Kalkstein was 9 for 17 on a career-high 197 passing yards. Sophomore linebacker Eric Rolfes, who recorded 11 tackles, led the defense in this victory.
The now .500 Tartans, with a record of 2–2, will face Hiram College on Saturday, Oct. 1 in Hiram, Ohio. Last season, the Tartans clobbered Hiram, 62–31. Tartan fans can only hope for the same result.

It’s been a while since I’ve been able to say this, but the Boston Red Sox are chokers once again. In the midst of the start of the NFL season, many casual baseball fans have overlooked the epic choke that is going on in Boston. Just two weeks ago, they were up a full nine games on the Tampa Bay Rays, the second-place team in the wild card race. Going into Sunday’s games, the Rays are now only down 1.5 games, and the Sox still have to play the Yankees in a doubleheader, while the Rays get the Blue Jays for a game. How sweet would it be for the Yankees to knock their most hated rival out of the playoffs? In the eyes of a Yankees fan, that would be the best thing to happen all season.
For a team that had high expectations coming into the season, this is the opposite situation that the Red Sox were expected to be in. The Red Sox were the “winners” of the off-season, trading for slugging first baseman Adrian Gonzalez, signing speedy outfielder Carl Crawford, and upgrading their bullpen without giving up too much major-league talent. Now, the Sox are fighting to even compete for the right to a playoff spot. What those experts failed to realize, and what we now see in this Sox team, is that its pitching depth is mediocre at best.
Let’s take a look. The Sox began their season with a rotation that was considered to be one of the better ones in the MLB, boasting two top-notch pitchers in Josh Beckett and Jon Lester as their aces. Following them were the young stud Clay Buchholz, the veteran John Lackey, and the Japanese-born Daisuke Matsuzaka. At first, it looked like a rotation with a lot of promise. But as the season started, Lackey and Matsuzaka were largely ineffective, with the latter on the 60-day disabled list and the former with an abysmal earned run average of 6.49. The fact that Lackey is still in the rotation, especially pitching big games, is a sign that this team wasn’t as good as everyone thought. Along with Buchholz’s yearly injuries, you get a rotation that leans heavily on two starters to get through every five days. This wear and tear on Beckett and Lester over a full season is taxing when two starting pitchers are depended upon so heavily. Sox fans will look to the ancient knuckleballer Tim Wakefield and Lackey to pitch Sunday against the Yankees in a double-header, probably the two biggest games of the season for the Sox.
Another big reason for the Red Sox’s failures falls strictly on their big free agent splash, Carl Crawford. The ex-Ray was supposed to be a sparkplug at the top of the Boston lineup, setting the table for their big hitters. This year, Crawford has a .295 on-base percentage (OBP), which is one of the worst in the league, especially for a player of his caliber. Not only that, but Crawford only has 18 steals on the season, just a year removed from leading the league in that category with 47 steals, and two seasons after posting a monstrous 60 steals. Crawford even went out of his way to apologize to the Boston faithful this week for his awful season, one that would be even more magnified if not for the other free agent busts around the league.
Going into the final week of the season, the Red Sox will have to fight for their playoff lives against the Yankees and eventually, the bottom-dwelling Orioles, while the Rays finish their series against the Blue Jays and then close out against the Yanks. All things point in favor to the Red Sox somehow holding on, but after losing 17 of 22 games, nothing seems like a given at this point.

A group of Carnegie Mellon researchers, in association with Disney Research of Pittsburgh, are bringing animations closer to reality by modeling accurate eye blinks.
Conventional systems that model eye blinks have always assumed them to be symmetric. In other words, during an eye blink, a person’s eyelids move down at the same rate that they move back up. While this may be a rational assumption to make, researchers’ high speed cameras a slightly different story: real human eyelids go down quickly during an eye blink, followed by a more gradual opening back up.
While it may not be apparent what difference this minor detail makes, it turns out this is a huge matter of importance for animators striving for realism, especially in big-budget feature-length animated films. Laura Trutoiu, a Ph.D. student in Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute involved in this research, shed some light on why this is the case.
“Because we see so many eye blinks daily, we’re pretty good at intrinsically ‘understanding’ a good eye blink,” Trutoiu explained. “So even though it’s very hard for a person to tell you what is a good eye blink, when you actually see something that’s wrong with one, that’s when you can tell.”
To further illustrate her point, Trutoiu pointed to an interesting study her team conducted. In this study, participants were asked to view over 300 types of blink animations and rate the “naturalness” of each one along the way. In spite of the overall tediousness of the process, all of the participants rated the blinks resembling real data significantly higher than those with simple, symmetric algorithms.
“People might not be able to describe what’s different about them, but they do recognize them as different,” summarized Liz Carter, a research associate in the Robotics Institute also involved with the blinking studies.
There is a lot more to the team’s research than just the speed at which the eye blinks. “There are other interesting points, like how the lower eyelid moves, how the eyes close, and so on,” said Trutoiu.
Taking all of these and other factors into consideration, the research team then utilized tracking software to capture real human eye motions, and generated a data set that described the motions that could be fed into a matrix. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a way to highlight the important features of arbitrary input information, was then applied to the old data to generate new types of realistic blinking motions.
“Using PCA to lower the dimensionality of the data can also bring out patterns in the original data that would otherwise be harder to detect,” Trutoiu noted. 
“In the case of eye blinks, a 150-points time series can be represented with 3–5 principal components.” In other words, PCA takes the plethora of information about eye blink motions, and simplifies that information to its most basic form.
Animating realistic eye blinks on three-dimensional models is a great way for animators to add more realism to their work, but they also have to be wary of falling into a hidden trap.
“So, basically, as robots or animated characters become more realistic, you like them up to a certain point,” Carter said. “[After this point], it becomes really creepy and you don’t like them at all,” she explained.
“It’s the uncanny valley hypothesis,” Trutoiu added, referring to the term coined by robotics researcher Masahiro Mori in 1970.
“It’s hard to say how important eye blinks are overall, but if you want realistic character animations, you have to get everything right. If that means raising the eyebrows or the eye blinks correctly, it’s going to make a huge difference. If you mess up one of those tiny, tiny things, you’ve just ruined the whole image.”
Readers who have seen the 2007 CGI film Beowulf, may be familiar with this effect already. It has been noted by some as lacking the “true spark of life” in its animated moving faces, despite its ultra-realistic attempts. So if you’ve ever been unnerved by that “almost real but not quite” look in Beowulf or other ultra-realistic animations, the uncanny valley hypothesis might have had something to do with it.
The researchers published their study in the Association for Computing Machinery Transactions on Applied Perception, and gave a talk on their findings at the Symposium on Applied Perception in Graphics and Visualization in Toulouse, France, earlier this year.

Email is a versatile tool often accused of replacing the postal mail system. But exactly how does this technology work?
In its very early stages, email was simply a text message sent from one place to another, similar to telgraphic communication. In fact, Morse code telegraphs could be classified as ancestors of email from the 1930s.
In 1960, when computers were enormous, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) created a system in which, for the first time, many people could log onto the same computer using different dial-up connections and each person could store data in the computer. From this, people discovered many innovative ways to send messages between the different dial-up connections connected to the central computer.
In 1971, Ray Tomlinson developed a way to communicate between these computers by using the ‘@’ symbol, therefore leading email closer to the modern-day version.
According to the website How-to Geek, “email was, at that time, the equivalent of today’s text message. Over time, it changed and evolved like anything else; it has sender and receiver info, a subject line, a message body, and attachments, but on the whole, emails are pretty simple documents.”
Email works in a series of steps by using a domain, which is the portion of an email message after the ‘@’ symbol. For example, in the email address bob@cmu.edu, cmu.edu is the domain. The domain identifies the computer network the email is going to.
After a user presses “send” on the computer, the email actually gets sent by the computer to an outgoing mail server through the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). According to How-to Geek, “The SMTP server is like your local post office, which checks your postage and address and figures out where to send your mail.” However, the SMTP server cannot find an address by looking at the domain. It therefore contacts another server known as the Domain Name Server (DNS).
The DNS is like the internet’s yellow pages. It has the ability to convert a domain like cmu.edu to an IP address, which is a numerical address assigned to a device on a computer network, such as 128.2.42.10. The DNS also checks to see if the domain has any mail exchange servers on it, then sends all that information back to the SMTP server.
The SMTP server sends the message to the correct server identified by the DNS, called a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA). The MTA takes the information sent into it and decides exactly where to put the email.
After its long journey that takes place over a few seconds, the email finally reaches its destination. There are two primary conventions for receiving email: Post Office Protocol (POP) and Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP). POP works similar to a post office: users can just connect to the internet, get all their email from the server, and then disconnect from the internet. It is very useful if one wants to take mail from different inboxes and put them all in the same place.
IMAP, however, allows you to store the email in a server and simply access it from different clients like your phone, iPod, and laptop. That way, if one reads a message on a laptop, it will still be marked as read when one accesses email through a phone. With the increasing popularity of web-based mail services and users with multiple devices, IMAP has largely replaced POP.
In summary, sending and receiving email is a little more complicated than what users see when they click “send” or open their inbox. The sent email goes to a SMTP server which then contacts a DNS. Then the email travels through the internet to a particular domain and its MTA server, from which it can go to a particular user’s account. The user can then fetch the email from his or her account through either POP or IMAP depending on his or her preference.
However, all of this happens behind the scenes; users are never informed of these events in the seemingly simple process of sending an email. Whether the message is connecting two distant family members, rekindling old friendships, or relaying important business information, many may find it difficult to deny the importance of email. Especially with today’s fast-paced society, the absence of email would bring textual communication to a screeching halt.

Light-paced heart cells created
A team of researchers at Stanford University has bioengineered human heart cells to pulse at a rate controlled by light of a certain brightness. As the light changes in intensity, the pace of these cells changes with it, and their motion ceases only when the light is shut off. These special cardiomyocytes were designed by inserting light-sensitive proteins into stem cells, making them different from regular heart cells. According to the researchers, this breakthrough holds promise in the fields of bioengineering and medicine, as the future may see light-based pacemakers.

Neutrinos exceed cosmic speed limit
An international team of researchers has recently measured neutrinos, tiny subatomic particles, traveling faster than the speed of light. Measurements were taken over a period of three years in which neutrinos travelled 454 miles from Geneva, Switzerland, to Gran Sasso, Italy — an average of 60 nanoseconds faster than it would have taken a beam of light to make the trip. According to Einstein’s relativity, nothing with mass can travel faster than the speed of light, therefore physicists around the world are looking carefully for even the most minuscule of errors.

New processor requires little power
This past week, Intel unveiled a prototype processor chip that operates with virtually no energy. It utilizes near-threshold voltage processors that can be sustained with minimum power consumption. While other chips on the market require one volt, this chip runs on 400 to 500 millivolts. To demonstrate its efficiency, the processor was used in a computer running Linux, with its only source of power being a 4-square centimeter solar cell. With lower energy use, however, comes a decrease in accuracy — an issue Intel plans to address in the future.

Solar3D develops efficient solar cells
Silicon’s impressive efficiency in conversion between light energy and electricity and the high energy-retention rate of optical fibers make these materials vital to the solar power industry. Solar3D has taken advantage of these in the development of their new 3-D solar cells, which use a variety of techniques to trap as much light as possible. The cells are coated with silicon dioxide, which minimizes reflection and guides light inward. Optical fibers are woven inside the cells, each with different refractive indices. These retain entering light photons long enough to store a much greater amount of their energy.

Bioengineered cats aid in study
Researchers at MayoClinic College of Medicine in Minnesota and Yamaguchi University in Japan have bioengineered cats so that they glow green in the dark. The fluorescence of these kittens, however, is not what makes them special; these felines contain an antiviral protein for Feline Immunodeficiency Virus. This virus has been spreading ferociously throughout the global feline population because cats do not have TRIMSalpha, a protein that protects the immune system from these types of viruses. The results of this experiment can potentially be extended to immunodeficiency viruses in other mammals, including humans.

Leaps in quantum computing
Researchers at UC-Santa Barbara have developed the first functioning quantum computer equipped with RAM and an information processing unit. Quantum computing differs from its more mainstream transistor-based counterpart, as it uses quantum properties to store and manipulate data. The computer consists of basic superconducting circuits and allows for the storage of quantum bits. Its current functionality is limited to simple algorithms, but the approach is scalable to larger and more powerful quantum computers.

Over in the Purnell Center for the Arts, an innovative brand of theater has been brewing, thanks to a student-formed theater company, In The Basement Theater. While the company first grew out of the School of Drama’s annual Playground in 2009, Sophia Schrank, a senior drama student, and her team members quickly realized that the company was something they wanted to continue long after Playground ended.
In The Basement Theater is movement-based theater — which, in layman terms, is storytelling through body movements. The company, whose “name stemmed from our make-do rehearsal spot in the laundry room of Purnell’s basement,” as Schrank explained, makes extensive use of papier-mâché masks and puppets in its performances. The group mixes dance, mask-work, and multi-lingual text to “create work that explores the beauty of humanity through contrast,” its site says.
From summer 2009 until January 2011, In the Basement created several independent pieces and performed four shows. Eventually the group was itching to work on a larger scale, and its members decided to apply for the opportunity of a lifetime — the chance to perform at the New York International Fringe Festival. Having received great feedback from their instructors, the group filled out applications and then waited for the results. “It was a long wait,” recalled Jessie Ryan Shelton, a senior musical theater major, “and the application was like applying to school all over again.”
But patience paid off: In April 2011, the company was informed that it had been selected to perform in New York. Katy Stepanov, a junior drama major, described the honor as overwhelming. “The New York International Fringe Festival is the largest multi-arts event in North America and has over 200 participants from all over the world, with a third of them being international participants,” she said. “Plus, we were going to be performing at Ellen Stewart’s La MaMa [Experimental Theatre], which is the mother of experimental theater.” For its performance, the company decided to revisit a piece that it had debuted years ago – Chien de Moi, which roughly translates as “my dog.”
Schrank, the writer and director behind Chien de Moi, explained, “_Chien de Moi_ tells the tale of a young woman who falls in a deep, unlikely love while inside her own frighteningly beautiful nightmare.” The young woman, lonely in her new dream world, finds comfort in the arms of a man with a dog’s face and is happy beyond words to be in love with him. However, the chaos of her new surroundings soon brings her back to the real world, only for her to realize that the world of fantasy is the only one she can relate to anymore.
Despite its fantastical premise, the work is deeply personal; “For [Schrank] it was similar to taking the inner details of her life and putting it out there for everyone to see, and expressing a message through the beauty of theater,” said Marquis Wood, a junior drama student. “What brought about this trust was the fact that we trained together in a give-and-take atmosphere which involved obsessive-compulsive pre-planning, and at the end of the day it was just our love [for our work] that inspired us to keep moving forward.” 
But despite the students’ love for performance, it wasn’t an easy ride. The company had to face many other challenges in its journey to the Fringe Festival, the largest of which was funding. As Schrank wrote on the group’s Kickstarter page, there was “lighting equipment to be rented, costume materials to be purchased and publicity fliers to be printed.” There were also added costs such as travel and living expenses that needed to be covered.
To raise the money, the troupe decided to make a profile on Kickstarter, a site that describes itself as “a new way to fund and follow creativity.” Creative enterprises, like In The Basement Theater, can set up a page with a certain goal for funds; if they fail to meet that goal, they don’t receive any of the money raised.
Simultaneously, the company pushed itself to look for creative promotional methods. Apart from putting up fliers, the company members realized that nothing was better than self-promotion — or as Schrank called it, “shameless promotion” — and that word of mouth was the most powerful method of raising awareness. Shelton said, “We traveled in the subway wearing dog masks so that people would notice us, and they did. It was embarrassing, but it was the best way to promote ourselves. We even went to Bryant Park and performed three or four of our pieces, and people approached us, curious to know what this was about.” In The Basement only set out to raise $1,500, but its promotional efforts paid off, and the company ended up with a sum of $3,100.
Aside from the practical challenge of funding, the theater troupe had creative challenges to face as well, such as space — they were limited to a small setting at La MaMa, and they had to make sure that “they didn’t kick anyone while performing, or worse, kick themselves,” Wood said. However, the company’s camaraderie and teamwork made it easier to overcome any obstacles. According to Schrank, “We were a running dialogue together — if one person let go, another person took his or her place. If a particular performer was missing for one rehearsal, someone always took his place for the day, learned all the steps, and taught them to the person the next day.” Whether it was training in ballroom dancing, experience with martial arts, or work with a puppet theater company, each member brought something different and vital to the company.
When the time came to finally perform, the group’s efforts seemed to pay off: The shows were all sold out, and the reviews were positive. Mateo Moreno praised the show in his review for the creative networking organization Big Vision Empty Wallet, saying, “The strangeness of the piece made me feel like I was witnessing my own dream.... Writer/Director Sophia Schrank and her merry band of madcap majors deserve all the accolades they’re sure to get with this inventive and highly original piece. Find the section between your pillow and your eye, close your eyes, and take it in.” An elated Schrank said, “Everyone could find something that could relate the piece to their personal life, which is exactly what we had hoped for.”
While the positive response was thrilling, the opportunity to work in New York City was an inspirational experience in itself. “Going from a homegrown environment [at Carnegie Mellon] to one where everything was new was scary, but it just made our creativity expand,” said Stepanov. Shelton said, “It was wonderfully inspirational to be in a city where so much creative energy is flying around left and right. Even in such a big city you never know who you’re going to run into on the street. The guy sitting next to you on the subway could be the set designer for a show happening two doors down from your own for all you know! Just brilliant.” 
Adrian Enscoe, who designed the masks for the show, added in an email, “I was real jazzed that we were voted most visually captivating at the Fringe this year. Living and putting up a show in New York was like a dream, a hopeful peek into what we could be doing a couple years down the line. We were welcomed so warmly by the theater community there, it seemed like anything was possible. I’m going to make a habit of going back, even if we’re not performing.”
So, what’s next after presenting work in one of North America’s most influential theater communities? Schrank is now aiming for pieces longer than 45 minutes and announced that the team has unanimously decided to invest Chien de Moi’s box office money toward its next piece. Until then, as Wood put it, “The team is just waiting for Sophia to dream of something new.”

“Smell her. Taste her. Sing to her. Kiss and lick her. Keep her clean. Please recycle.” These are suggestions from Annie Sprinkle and Elizabeth Stephen’s 25 Ways to Make Love to the Earth.
Annie Sprinkle visited Carnegie Mellon this past week and hosted many events, including a lecture and an ecosexual walking tour. Sprinkle is a former prostitute and pornographic actress and has now taken on the role of being an ecosexual advocate.
Her notion of ecosex and being an ecosexual is essentially a “love thy Earth” mantra with a provocative twist. As she says, “It is about switching the metaphor ‘Earth mother’ to ‘Earth lover.’” She has become a strong environmentalist, which serves as the impetus for her and her partner’s ecosexual movement. She is creating a lexicon for this movement, using words such as “vegesexual,” “compostgasm,” “ecoslut,” and “snowjob.”
Ecosexuality is a relatively new term Sprinkle advocates, and can be defined as seeking the sensual and sexual aspects of nature and connecting with them. Her unusual ideas lack evidence or reasoning, which has drawn in more people, but also allows for a rift to manifest between those who cannot so readily relate to her lofty notions. Her ideas of ecosexuality can range from masturbating alongside a flower you feel “a strong connection with” — an example she referenced that stemmed from an anecdote — to running your feet through the grass. Even “listening to the wind and the trees can be really sexual,” according to Sprinkle.
Sprinkle is a vibrant redhead who wore a loud, long pink dress with purple feathers in her hair, along with a generous amount of makeup to complete the outfit. Her presence in McConomy was intriguing and drew the viewer in so as to learn more about her interesting persona. Her lecture recounted her colorful 57-year lifespan thus far, and her 39 years of studying sex — she earned a Ph.D. from the Institute for Advanced Study on Human Sexuality, a non-nationally accredited institution. In her lecture, she travelled through the sex industries of the ’70s, ’80s, and ’90s, giving the viewers a point of reference so that they could see how strides have been made in terms of feminism, sexual health, and acceptance of the sex industry.
The audience travelled through her life and was given an idea of the types of projects she has worked on, such as her show A Public Cervix Announcement, where she invited patrons to explore the region between her legs with a flashlight. She included pictures of her Extreme Kissing events where she and her partner participated in a manifestation of performance art by kissing in an art gallery for three hours without stopping. In a similar vein, they had one event where they were “extreme kissing” nude in public. 
Needless to say, Sprinkle had remarkable stories and experiences to share that were entertaining and inspired many laughs, but she did lack one quality: authority. Yes, she is a seasoned veteran when it comes to sex and the entire industry, yet when she spoke she lacked a certain sense of conviction, especially when it came to ecosexuality. In her lecture and throughout much of her walking tour she asserted many ideas, but she seemed incapable of supporting those claims. For instance, as she led the walking tour to the garden next to Hunt Library, she proclaimed, “We are having sex with the Earth right now.” Many would disagree with this notion. She mentioned that “sex is all around us.... It is going on with the plants and animals.” It is unusual that what she classifies as sex, many others would classify merely as reproduction. 
She raised ideas that were thought-provoking and unusual, but she was unable to provide reasoning that would have enabled an outsider to truly connect with her ideas. This begs the question: If she has no manner of supporting her assertions, then are they truly worth believing?
Sprinkle was well received by the student body, and students seemed to be open to hearing her story and listening to what she had to say. Marielle Saums, a junior global studies major with a minor in biology and art, said, “It [Sprinkle’s lecture] was wonderful, and the students seemed to have liked it because she is an unusual speaker.” The crowd erupted into loud applause when she announced that she would leave behind a few of her published materials, including both films and books, for Hunt Library. 
Sprinkle opened students’ minds to topics that they may not have given much thought to before, such as the relationship between sex and ecology. “Annie is a really sweet lady with very different ideas,” reflected Shelby Cunningham, a sophomore psychology and biology major, after having been married to the Earth along with a small group of Carnegie Mellon students. Sprinkle’s ideas certainly acted as food for thought, but they left many students hungry for her to elaborate on her ideas. Just because someone is a self-professed authority in their field does not mean that others should follow said person without questioning them.

50/50 is based on writer Will Reiser’s own experience in dealing with cancer and the struggles that come with it, from both a comedic and a serious standpoint. The appeal of this movie comes from how effectively humor and drama are blended to make a story that is both heart-wrenching and heartwarming.
The film starts by showing the everyday life of 27-year-old Adam Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), including his relationships with his girlfriend (Bryce Dallas-Howard) and his best friend and Seattle radio station coworker Kyle (Seth Rogen). After a visit to the doctor’s office, Adam finds out that he has spinal cancer, and that there is a 50 percent survival rate for this particular type of cancer. Adam proceeds to tell his mother (Anjelica Huston) and father (Serge Houde). He also starts to see a therapist, the young and inexperienced Katie (Anna Kendrick).
Gordon-Levitt portrays Adam in an entertaining way, while also being able to demonstrate the gravity of his situation. At first it may seem as if Gordon-Levitt is recycling his character from 500 Days of Summer; however, Adam is a far more independent character with a greater range of emotions. Rogen is often found at the funniest moments of the film, employing an unexpected amount of crass humor for a movie dealing with cancer. He continues his tradition of playing vulgar and often stoned characters in 50/50, yet it works perfectly with the style of the film and the other characters. Adam and Kyle’s antics provide many laughs, and their friendship feels believable for the most part. Kendrick excellently performs the role of Katie, Adam’s therapist. Her attempts to come off as professional despite being fairly inexperienced create both humor in the scene and anxieties in Adam’s character.
What is most noticeable about 50/50 is how expertly executed the jarring transitions between moods are. The contrast between hilarious and poignant is so harsh and rapid that it has a unique effect on the audience. At one moment Adam interrogates Kyle on the previous usage of the electric razor he is about to shave his head with, and the next moment the viewer can sense the extreme isolation that Adam suffers from dealing with cancer and an increasingly distant girlfriend. It is this style that makes the film so compelling, never letting the audience settle on one emotion.
One thing that the film does not try to do is inspire you to “go out and live life to the fullest.” It touches on Adam’s regrets, but thankfully never takes the next step of turning into The Bucket List. It deals with people handling the adversities that life presents. The focus stays on each character’s growth and the growth of their relationships with each other. As Adam learns more about the people in his life, his relationships with them change and he learns more about himself. It is the excellent delivery of both pain and comedy, as well as the emotional impact of the story, that makes this one of the better films of the year.
50/50 comes out in theaters Sept. 30.

When one thinks of Pittsburgh, “home of an internationally recognized orchestra” is probably nowhere near the top of the list of things that come to mind. The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra’s concert with violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter on Sept. 17, however, proved that Pittsburgh has a musical giant in its midst.
The PSO had just returned from an extended tour in Europe, where it enjoyed a warm reception from audiences. Yet even preceded by an international tour, the orchestra’s first performance since its return to Pittsburgh was anything but anticlimactic. With selections from Bizet’s Carmen, Mendelssohn’s Italian Concerto, and Ravel’s Bolero — not to mention the stunning performance of Grammy-winning solo violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter — the program certainly announced that the now internationally recognized orchestra is a force to be reckoned with.
Despite the orchestra’s excellence, Mutter was the jewel of the evening’s performance, with her strong stage presence and distinct stylistic voice. Crossing the stage in a bold red dress to a round of thunderous applause, she began her solo dramatically and with an unusual abundance of vibrato that at times seemed flowery, even excessive. From any other violinist, this excess of vibrato might be an indication of frayed nerves; but Mutter, far from self-conscious, played with a refreshing combination of confidence and spontaneity, at times even reaching to tighten her bow or pluck off a broken bow hair in the short breath of space between phrases.
Mendelssohn’s Violin Concerto certainly highlighted Mutter’s exceptional ability to play vigorously yet also bring out the tenderness of some of the slower phrases in a remarkable juxtaposition of fierce and soft. On the other hand, Sarasate’s Fantasy on Carmen, a true virtuoso piece, showcased Mutter’s exquisite technical ability and her prowess as one of the most celebrated violinists in today’s musical world.
The orchestra, though merely accompanying during the solo pieces, was not to be overlooked. The performances of the Italian Symphony and of Carmen certainly established the orchestra’s capability, demonstrating well-rehearsed professionalism, elegant dynamics, and sheer grace. But the final selection on the program, Ravel’s mesmerizing Bolero, unquestionably showcased the PSO’s potential for greatness as an emerging orchestra on the international stage. The performance — an incredibly slow, nearly undetectable crescendo throughout, carried by a simple and repetitive yet hypnotic dance-like melody — earned the orchestra a wild standing ovation.
The PSO’s recent tour in Europe was only a taste of the things to come for this emerging international presence. Though less established than its peers, the PSO is unquestionably a rising star on the musical scene.

Garfield may be a bit off the beaten path for most Carnegie Mellon students, but the up-and-coming neighborhood holds a hidden gem: Salt of the Earth. Opened in September 2010, this restaurant was named 2011’s Best New Restaurant by Pittsburgh Magazine. Salt of the Earth, a collaboration between chef Kevin Sousa and architects Doug and Lisa Cruze, works to “take advantage of local and seasonal product procured in its prime,” according to its website, and focuses on the quality, rather than quantity, of menu items.
The restaurant’s design is overwhelmingly hip; among the long, wooden tables for communal dining, the large chalkboard wall displaying the menu, the oddly-shaped dishes, and the water glasses that vaguely resemble test tubes, the space treads dangerously close to being over-designed. Luckily, the quality of the food and service make it easy to forgive the over-eagerness of the decor.
Salt of the Earth, which markets itself as a “creative American restaurant,” has an extraordinarily diverse menu with dishes that bring together unexpected flavors. The chalkboard menu merely lists all of the flavors for each dish — the only description provided for “Soup” is “squash, apple, chervil, argan” — but the servers will elaborate in detail about any of the dishes. Don’t be intimated by the unusual flavor pairings; the risotto with cantaloupe and octopus, for example, might not sound particularly appetizing, but together with prosciutto and miso, it makes for a surprisingly delightful and intensely flavorful dish.
The desserts provide a contemporary, gourmet twist on classic foods. The s’more is not the same dessert you roast over a campfire; rather, it’s more of a deconstructed, gourmet version of the classic favorite. Homemade marshmallow fluff flavored with elderberry is spread on a plate next to a pile of graham cracker crumbs, a cube of fudgy chocolate, and gelato, with small elderberries scattered across the plate.
In addition to the diverse food menu, Salt of the Earth offers a selection of beverages that is capable of humbling any knowledgeable cocktail, wine, or beer enthusiast. To start, the restaurant usually rotates a selection of four different beers from around the region, including Pittsburgh’s own Penn and East End breweries. The wine list is extensive and can be intimidating, but the staff is knowledgeable and willing to answer any questions or even make pairing suggestions.
The cocktail list is seemingly simple, yet subtly complex. With ingredients such as lychee, a tropical fruit tree native to southeast Asia, and rose water, Salt’s combination of ingredients creates cocktails with new tastes that just may be greater than the sum of their parts. Each cocktail is named by its base spirit, such as “Vodka” or “Rum,” and utilizes local spirits when possible, such as Boyd and Blair Vodka, which is distilled in Glenshaw, just a little over six miles from Salt of the Earth. Although the consumer may be apprehensive about trying a cocktail with unfamiliar ingredients, the bartenders and servers are available to inform customers of every beverage on the menu.
Salt of the Earth may not be your typical dining experience, but it is a delightful gastronomic adventure worth exploring.

On a new sitcom on Fox, Zooey Deschanel (500 Days of Summer) stars in New Girl as the endearingly awkward Jess Days. In a hilarious flashback that starts off the show, Jess prances around naked in her boyfriend’s apartment, clumsily knocking over plants and accompanying her awkward seduction attempts with a goofy song. Naïve and adorable, she is taken unaware when she realizes her boyfriend was with another girl, prompting her to move out and find a new apartment.
The new roommates she stumbles upon are an unlikely match for her. Coach (Damon Wayans) is the short-tempered personal trainer for Schmidt (Max Greenfield), a self-proclaimed ladies’ man. The two make a humorous duo, and their over-the-top antics are balanced by their down-to-earth roommate, Nick (Jake Johnson). The episode suffers from some awkward insertion of necessary exposition, such as Nick’s break-up six months earlier. Although clunky, this is to be expected from a pilot episode.
Zooey Deschanel is the magic of the show, and she carries her co-stars throughout much of the episode. The timing of the other actors is not always on par, but luckily for them, the show doesn’t rely on quick-fire witty lines. Rather, it focuses on Jess’ quirky qualities, such as singing to herself and dropping references to Lord of the Rings, which make her imperfect and relatable.
It does require some suspension of disbelief to accept that Jess is supposedly an undesirable dating partner, because she is still physically attractive despite her awkwardness in social settings. In real life — or at least at Carnegie Mellon — a pretty girl who exposes her inner dork would have guys chasing after her from all directions.
At times, however, it seems that when the writers don’t know how to end a scene, they resort to Jess dancing badly or singing a funny couplet. When they don’t use this method, sometimes a plainly bad line ends a scene, like when Coach tells Jess, “Your hair is on fire,” as she styles it with her curling iron. Dull lines like these make one feel like the show is riding on Deschanel’s quirky and adorable coattails, rather than clever writing or interesting characters.
While Nick is a nuanced character, which we see in his interactions with his ex-girlfriend, the other two male characters seem caricature-like. Schmidt is a sleazeball the entire episode, and he doesn’t act sweetly toward Jess the same way the others do. Coach’s random short-tempered explosions are stressful, not funny. Of course, there is always room for these characters to grow throughout the season.
New Girl has the potential to turn into a reference-worthy show with gags like the Douchebag Jar, in which Schmidt has to put money when he says something sleazy, or Jess’ terrible pick-up line, “Hey, sailor.” However, most people will ultimately continue to watch it for its cute and quirky lead girl, not for original or side-splitting writing.
New Girl airs on FOX every Tuesday at 9/8c.

Buenos Aires is a city of highs and lows. One night you are having the time of your life, dancing at an amazing nightclub and enjoying all the luxuries youth has to offer (free entry and drinks included). The next day you are walking down a street while scanning through pictures on your new DSLR camera when suddenly a man comes from behind, pulls a knife out on you at 4:30 p.m. in broad daylight, and demands that you give him your camera.
I took a wrong turn. I made a mistake. I didn’t know.
The whole thing was pretty silly, actually. The man was not very intimidating at all. He was about the same age and weight as I am – muy flaco (skinny). His knife was small and rusted. Imagining his thought process before he decided to take action is very simple. There I was, being cool and American and carefree with my DSLR around my neck, wearing a really cute T-shirt I’d just ordered online, prancing around one of the most dangerous barrios in Buenos Aires, La Boca. La Boca visitors are advised to walk along only two sites, El Caminito and the Boca Juniors’ soccer stadium — one step away from these tourist sites and you’re in danger. So, one wrong step and I was an easy target. El ladrón_ (the thief) knew this. I knew this. To him, I was carrying four months worth of rent on my neck — or maybe even a ticket out of poverty.
How could I have been so dumb?
When I finally realized the situation I was in, I gave a classic scream, but the scream didn’t feel sincere. It was as if I were screaming just because that’s what I had seen people do in the movies. I tried to snatch back my camera but to no avail. El ladrón ran off, and (because it is what one does in the movies) I ran after him. But then... I stopped. I realized I was not in a movie and that the situation I was in was a result of my own actions. I had known La Boca was a dangerous place, but in my defense, I didn’t think the area looked very dangerous. Sure, there were garbage and dilapidated buildings around me, but that’s what many parts of the city look like!
So, picture this: Me standing in the middle of the street watching the thief disappear into the concrete maze while yelling for help that never came. Such a tourist’s tale.
After the incident, I went to El Caminito to see the famous, colorful conventillos, which were boarding houses for poor families in the early twentieth-century. I had remembered seeing these houses so enchantingly displayed in photos prior to arriving. But as I sat on a bench staring at the conventillos (a moment I had looked forward to for months), I hated Argentina. I was not mad at el ladrón but mad at a country, a country that would allow its people to live in such terrible circumstances; mad because of the pollution around the city; mad at the deep disparities in income and wealth in Argentina, in the U.S., in the world.
To put myself at ease with my experience with el ladrón, I forced myself to believe that he sold my camera and bought his family a decent meal that night or paid February’s rent on time, or maybe even ordered a cute shirt online.
I remained frozen on the bench in front of the conventillos. I couldn’t move. I spent 20 minutes connecting the dots between my life and the life of my thief.
Buenos Aires is an amazing, wild city. There are so many opportunities available: beautiful restaurants, people, shopping, dancing, and laughing; there is fun! But with the glamour of any city — especially a Latin American city — comes high poverty and crime. This is no revelation. But as students studying abroad, our definition of street savvy may not translate directly to other countries’ definitions of the term.
I have a special place in my heart for Buenos Aires. My experience with el ladrón was a roadblock and not a small one. But once I made Argentine friends and sang karaoke every Wednesday with my Argentine family, I felt really good and really confident, stomping the streets of “Baires.” I didn’t want to leave. How can I explain the smell of alfajores or the feeling of dancing at a nightclub at 7 a.m? How can I describe the hundreds of faces I passed everyday? I can’t.
Studying abroad is a roller coaster, and at the end of the day you just have to roll with it. You are not in the U.S. anymore, baby. But seriously, if you get caught in such an unlovely situation while abroad, just talk about it and seek guidance from the people around you, and it will all work out. Gracias a la vida, che!

Dear Patrick,
I woke up 20 minutes ago on a frat couch. It’s the middle of the night. I don’t know where I am. I’m covered in vomit, and there’s a large bloodstain on my right pant leg. How do I get home?
Please help,
Ostensibly Helpless Guy, Often Drinking In Heavy Excess, Awoken Rudely, Seeking Immediate Response, Encouragement, and Navigation Suggestions
Dear OH GOD I HEAR SIRENS,
First things first: Get out of that fraternity. Don’t make eye contact, don’t talk to anyone, just head straight for the door. Now, you need to figure out which direction you should travel. If the moon is in a crescent phase, make a line from the top tip to the bottom, and continue that line to the horizon. The intersection of that line and the horizon is south.
Alternatively, find a landmark like the Cathedral of Learning, and head for it. If you’re outside too long, you may have to forage for food. Squirrels are easy to catch — construct a simple loop with your shoelace, leave some bait in the middle, and tighten the loop when the squirrel steps inside. Skin and gut him, and build a fire using a nearby car’s battery. Now that you’re nourished, it should be easy to find your way back home.
Or just use the GPS in your phone,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I’m bad at small talk. Like, terrible. When someone starts talking to me I immediately start to have an asthma attack. I just have no idea what to say. How do I engage in normal, human conversation?
Thanks,
Completely Suck at Making Any Joke Or Repartee
Dear CS MAJOR,
Well, a good place to start is with your name — or theirs, if you’re feeling crazy. Then you can do the whole “what’s your major, what year are you, where do you live” thing. If all else fails, you can go with a premeditated line about their major. For instance, “Oh, you’re a drama major? You must think you’re better than me. It’s okay, it’s true” or “Wait, you’re CS? But you’re outside of a cluster and you don’t smell that bad!”
Basically, the easiest way to make conversation is to do as little talking as possible. People love talking about themselves. Just ask them questions and insert little comments while they’re rambling about how that two-day layover in Europe while on their way to a cruise really opened their eyes to, like, a whole other way of life, man. You just don’t get it ’til you’ve really seen it, dude.
Or try some Cyrano de Bergerac,
Patrick Hoskins

100 YEARS AGO -- Sept. 28, 1911
Among other job postings for math instructors, metallurgists, engineers, and lab chemists, a “Full-Time Employment” column in The Tartan advertises for an office boy to do typing and other errands. Salary: $6 a week. That amount actually sounds pretty good in the current economy.
50 YEARS AGO -- Sept. 27, 1961
The “Man of the Year” winner at the Sigma Nu fraternity’s national convention is a dean’s-list scholar in the math department, the Executive Council president for student government, and a top quarterback on the Tartans’ football team. It doesn’t say so, but he can probably bend steel beams and charm his girlfriend’s parents over dinner too.
25 YEARS AGO -- Sept. 23, 1986
Students sound off on Carnegie Mellon’s new logo, featuring a square tipped 14 degrees from vertical and the loss of the word “University.” Complainers fault the new design for being “too contemporary” and “too mainstream ’80s.” If fashion is truly cyclical, then we’d better get ready to tip our heads to the left again soon.
10 YEARS AGO -- Sept. 24, 2001
Citing the university’s state-of-the-art wireless network and its “integration of the Net into all aspects of campus life,” Yahoo! Internet Life magazine names Carnegie Mellon the most wired college in the nation for the second year in a row. The title means that, somehow, judges were able to look at the old Hub and Carnegie Mellon homepages without running away screaming.
FIVE YEARS AGO -- Sept. 25, 2006
The TOC and BOC job fairs are back on campus, pitting Carnegie Mellon students against the odds — and each other — for coveted internship and full-time positions. “Signing bonuses, expense accounts, and corporate jets are nice,” cautions The Tartan’s editorial board, “but honesty, consideration, and integrity are far more valuable.”
ONE YEAR AGO -- Sept. 27, 2010
The men’s soccer team moves to 8–0 after a last-minute win over Grove City College. The perfect streak is the team’s best start to a season in eight years, earning it a No. 3 national ranking. The Tartans finished the year 11–4 with one tied game.

Kung Fu Panda 2
Friday, Sept. 30
8 10 12
Jack Black reprises his role as Po, a panda named the Dragon Warrior of kung fu. In the sequel, Po must defeat Lord Shen (Gary Oldman), who was responsible for destroying his village. In addition to Black, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, and David Cross provide voices for the five kung fu masters allied with Po. The sequel further develops Po’s backstory, but the titular panda maintains the same clumsy personality from his debut film.
PhD: The Movie
Saturday, Oct. 1
7 8:30 10
PhD: The Movie is a live-action adaptation of popular webcomic Piled Higher and Deeper (better known as PhD Comics) by Jorge Cham. Filmed at the California Institute of Technology and starring real researchers and Ph.D. students, the movie follows the lives of four graduate students — Cecilia, Mike, Tajel, and the “Nameless Grad Student” — as they navigate their way through both their academic and social lives.
Pandorum
Sunday, Oct. 2
7:30 10 12:30
This 2009 science fiction thriller stars Corporal Bower (Ben Foster) and Lieutenant Payton (Dennis Quaid), crew members on a failing spaceship without any recollection of who they are or what their mission is.

Last Wednesday, I went to see The Dodos and The Felice Brothers at Mr. Small’s Theatre, and while the music was great, the audience really stole the show. The Dodos played first and the crowd was fairly predictable: a mixture of high schoolers, hipsters, and twenty-somethings who like consistently good indie rock.
After The Dodos’ set, the young crowd cleared out and an entirely new crowd appeared. I had never listened to The Felice Brothers, so I wasn’t sure what to expect. Presumably, however, their music would be similar to The Dodos and they would have a similar fan base. Not the case. The Felice Brothers put on a lively show with a variety of instruments (an accordion, a violin, and a synth, to name a few), and with so much happening on stage, it was hard to look away. But the audience was truly fascinating. The crowd was older and significantly rowdier than the crowd during The Dodos. Throughout their set I was torn between watching the band and watching the equally amusing audience.
The crowd during The Felice Brothers’ set made me think about audiences in general. What is it about audiences at concerts that makes them so interesting? Do they really affect how much fun I have at a show? Sometimes it’s such a predictable crowd — hip stoners at a Best Coast show, for instance, or well-dressed pseudo-intellectuals at Bon Iver. But crowds that aren’t so easily classified are truly intriguing. I highly doubt that anyone was at The Felice Brothers’ show to maintain a particular image, and the songs varied so much it was hard to classify the crowd based on genre. One thing was certain, though: everyone was having a great time.
Maybe, in the end, it’s less about the type of person at a show and simply about the atmosphere an audience can create. For me, the audience is what makes a great live show, and the crowd definitely pulled it off last week.

The administration announced that it plans to reimburse student organizations for all past and future administrative fees that have been applied to donations since July.
The fee, which applies to all donations given to any Carnegie Mellon department or entity, will be assessed monthly, but student organizations should expect to receive a matching credit every quarter. 
Currently, the fee is set at 5 percent of incoming donations, but the administration plans to raise it to 10 percent over the next two years. However, student organizations will always be reimbursed for the fee regardless of its amount.
Using the umbrella term “student organizations,” Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno confirmed that sports teams, Greek organizations, and Student Dormitory Council are also included with student clubs. “Any group that has a gift account is all in the same bucket. If a donation comes into them, they will not feel the effect of the fee,” Casalegno said.
The Board of Trustees initially proposed the administrative fee in 2008 to help fund Carnegie Mellon’s donor relations program.
“Essentially there was a deficit in the central administration funds that included, somewhat ironically, the people who were actually doing the fundraising,” explained junior social and decision sciences and statistics double major Will Weiner, who is also a Student Senator and chair of Senate’s Internal Development Committee. 
“The university had benchmarked other schools and looked at models for covering the costs of what it takes a run a donor relations program,” Casalegno explained. “We came to the conclusion that we were one of very few, if any, schools who don’t have an administrative fee assessed [for] incoming donations.”
After the economic crash of 2008, the idea was tabled. “We decided it was not the right time to implement this,” she said. However, in its February 2011 meeting, the Board of Trustees reintroduced the fee, planning for it to take effect in July.
According to Weiner and Student Body President Jake Flittner, a senior engineering and public policy and mechanical engineering double major, the administration did not immediately notify student organizations that they were going to be assessing this fee.
“I first heard it offhand, and then I had to confirm with Gina,” Weiner said. 
“I believe that one of the reasons why there has been a lack of advertisement of this is that the administration still hasn’t figured out the processes yet,” said Flittner. “The administration hadn’t really thought of a lot of the implementation problems, because it [the fee] was decided years ago.”
But despite the lack of publicity, the fee has been assessed since July, and Weiner, who is also general membership coordinator for Scotch’n’Soda, was one of the first students to notice the deductions in his organization’s budget.
“In July, we received a $50 donation, and we saw $2.50 gone,” he said. “It [the fee] comes out on your budget as a line item, as an expense, called ‘ADMIN FEE ON CONTRIBUTIONS.’ ”
Upon hearing student concerns, the administration reacted quickly to protect student organizations from the administrative fee. “We were ready to go in guns blazing [against the administrative fee], but after the first red flag was raised, 48 hours later we got what we wanted,” Flittner said.
In recognition of how much student organizations accomplish with their budgets, Casalegno and Vice President for Campus Affairs Michael Murphy announced that the central administration would reimburse student organizations for this fee. “Every dollar a student organization receives matters,” Casalegno said.
Although Casalegno admits that it would be better for the fee and subsequent reimbursement to not appear on the budget at all, she explained that the administration is also working within the technical constraints of its financial systems. 
“Because of the automated processes that run behind the scenes of everything, we don’t know if that [not assessing student organizations the fee] is possible,” she remarked. “But there are coding specialists with our Oracle accounts who are working through that right now.”

With the EOC, TOC, and BOC on campus last week, Carnegie Mellon students heard a great deal about future careers and opportunities. While many larger and more well-known tech firms were offering soon-to-be graduates lucrative deals, a startup company called Mixpanel was sending a different message. Mixpanel members hosted a talk titled “Why to Join a Startup over Google” in Gates Hillman last Thursday. Symbolically held across from a Google recruitment lecture, the Mixpanel event drew roughly 40 people and was conducted in a casual format, allowing for questions throughout.
Presentations were given by Mixpanel CEO and co-founder Suhail Doshi, as well as current employees and Carnegie Mellon alumni Anlu Wang (SCS ’10) and Raymond Lu (SCS ’11).
Doshi began the talk by remarking upon the intensive interview processes conducted by companies such as LinkedIn and Google, and contrasting it with the practices and atmosphere of smaller tech businesses. Inspired to create his own company after seeing a Business Week article featuring Digg founder Kevin Rose, Doshi began “trying to create something of value” as opposed to being just another “cog in a machine.” After some failed ideas and a stint at the technology company Slide, Doshi started Mixpanel in 2009.
Mixpanel provides an analytics service, geared toward website and application developers, with the goal “to help the world learn from their data,” according to its website. This service provides customers with live statistics and feedback on their applications and website, providing information on use, popularity, and other important metrics of a healthy tech product.
Since its inception, Mixpanel has garnered a fair deal of attention, with venture capital firms Y Combinator and Sequoia Capital investing in its development. 
In addition, Doshi and co-founder Tim Trefren have also attracted funds from individuals such as PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Bebo co-founder Michael Birch, and Square Chief Operating Officer Keith Rabois. Doshi paid special homage to Y Combinator in his talk, describing them as “[a] college for building a company,” and proceeded to note the value of their tutoring and workshops for startups accepted to their program.
Wang continued the lecture by expounding upon the business atmosphere in Silicon Valley and the options for a recent grad seeking employment. Lamenting that “you never get to hear from the lowly startups of Silicon Valley,” Wang recounted his experiences from a summer 2010 internship at Google by saying that they allowed you to “work on paradigm-shifting products which would let you change the world ... by working on the ‘save’ button.”
Continuing this line of thought, Lu concluded the talk by emphasizing the breadth of activities one could undertake as an employee. After giving a technical overview of Mixpanel as an analytics service, he announced that he was “working on the most important part of Mixpanel four months after graduating from Carnegie Mellon.”
Throughout the presentation, however, the speakers also acknowledged the difficulties and challenges of working for a startup. “I worked 18 hours a day, seven days a week, in the most boring place in California,” recalled Doshi, speaking of his first years on the job.
He also proceeded to concede that “startups will have hard times,” particularly when addressing funding issues. This idea had been echoed previously in the talk when Doshi asked the crowd what defined a startup, receiving “a company that needs money and programmers” as the main response.
Overall, Mixpanel’s presentation and presence on campus was well received. Students such as Matt Bauch, a senior electrical and computer engineering major, called its presentation “interesting and inspiring.” While working for a startup may be, as Wang stated at the TOC, “not heaven on Earth,” it is certainly a growing workstyle, and one which Mixpanel members hope future graduates will choose over employment at a larger company.

Initially colonized on Carnegie Mellon’s campus in 1917 and kicked off in 2005, the Delta Upsilon fraternity is returning to the university and opening a new chapter this year. Representatives from the Delta Upsilon International Fraternity Headquarters will be on campus for the next five weeks and will be recruiting and holding information sessions for men who have a desire to be founding fathers.
“We are on campus every day meeting students and looking for a group of diverse, self-driven gentlemen who are looking to bring a unique experience to Carnegie Mellon University,” said Stephen DeCarlo, a Delta Upsilon leadership consultant. “We are looking for men who want to be part of a fraternity committed to ‘Building Better Men’ for a global society through service, leadership development, and the lifelong personal growth of a diverse membership.”
An advisory board of eight people will help support the new founding fathers, in addition to acting as personal mentors for each undergraduate officer. Also involved with the new chapter will be the Carnegie Alumni Chapter, which has a nine-member executive panel and more than 800 living alumni who are industry leaders all over the globe.
Delta Upsilon has a long history on campus. Alumni from the Carnegie Mellon chapter include former Carnegie Mellon President Richard Cyert, members of the board of trustees, and current and former faculty members in every department. The fraternity was removed from the Greek Quadrangle and deactivated in 2005 after risk-management problems and a disciplinary ruling. After a six-year leave of absence, the Delta Upsilon fraternity plans to return this fall with  renewed commitment to the mission and principles of the organization.
DeCarlo notes that recolonization of the chapter will create a unique addition to the fraternity and sorority community at Carnegie Mellon. “The new members will be able to rebuild a chapter with almost 100 years of history and make it what they want,” he said.
Matthew Biegler, a senior materials science and biomedical engineering double major and president of the Carnegie Mellon Interfraternity Council 2011 executive board, explained, “Any time a new chapter has expanded onto campus, we have seen increased interest in Greek life and a renewed fervor in fraternal values.... The Interfraternity Council is absolutely in favor of expansion, be it by returning fraternities or new organizations starting up for the first time. We have seen the outcome of this in the past few years with only good things to say.”
“Greek life has made me a more organized, empowered, and passionate individual,” Biegler said. “Being in a fraternity has given me the tools to be a socially excellent and responsible leader and doer.”
Delta Upsilon will be the second new fraternity chapter on campus within the past year. Sigma Chi opened a chapter at Carnegie Mellon in the fall of 2010. Andrew Hudson, a sophomore materials science engineering major, is a founding father of Sigma Chi. “Filling the void for an organization that is proactive within our campus and will also last for many generations to come is a great experience,” Hudson said. “It’s good to be a part of a founding fathership in which you feel tight with the brotherhood and will maybe even have grandchildren that join someday.”
Other members of the Carnegie Mellon community also believe that the colonization of Delta Upsilon will have a positive impact. Bennett Kriete, a sophomore chemical engineering and engineering and public policy double major, said, “I think it’s good a new [fraternity] is being colonized and giving incoming freshmen a good leadership opportunity.”
Information sessions for male students interested in Delta Upsilon will continue from Sept. 27 through Oct. 13.

Tie-dyeing, free food, balloon animals, music, and free T-shirts were among the offerings at the first Dietrich College Pride Day, held last Wednesday on the College of Fine Arts lawn. The Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences Pride Day was intended to encourage H&SS students to interact with their academic peers, as well as raise awareness of their presence on campus. 
H&SS Dean John Lehoczky reflected on the personal excitement he felt on Dietrich Pride Day. “The students are phenomenal! It was wonderful to see everyone get together,” he said.
Organizing a pride day event was an idea that H&SS Connect — a group that organizes events for Dietrich College — had envisioned since the group was founded in 2009 by Nicole Ifill, a senior double major in information systems and human computer interaction. According to Ifill, she was inspired by the idea that since there is a variety of programs and majors in H&SS, it can be difficult for students to familiarize themselves with their peers within the same college.
“[Dietrich Pride Day] was a great success ... and I would definitely hope it would become an annual event,” said Ifill.
Dietrich College’s Academic Advising Center (AAC) staff spearheaded H&SS Connect and the development of Dietrich Pride Day, which they had been planning since last semester. Gloria Hill, assistant dean and director of the AAC, and Gary DiLisio, academic adviser in the AAC, were the main administrators who worked on the event. “We were pretty pleased with the way it turned [out],” DiLisio said. “I was blown away to see some of my advisees demonstrate their talents.”
Hill also added, “Since 2009 we had this idea to try to host an event that would better establish a strong bond among the students in this diverse college, and we really wanted the faculty and staff to be included. It was nice to see so much Dietrich pride.”
What is now known as the Dietrich College was established in 1969 and is the second largest college at Carnegie Mellon. It offers more than 60 majors and emphasizes interdisciplinary academic development.
Although the event began as H&SS Pride Day, it ended up as Dietrich Pride Day. The plans for this event began prior to the announcement of Dietrich’s gift and the college’s new name, which were well-kept secrets until Sept. 7. Dietrich Pride Day was, nevertheless, met with curiosity and interest from students who attended. “The students’ performances were wonderful. It was unusual for a pride day [to have students perform],” said Tyler Dossett, a junior psychology major.
Attendees noted that the stations for the activities were spaced in an impractical manner on the College of Fine Arts lawn, an issue that Hill recognized. She said that she has learned from the experience and will do things differently next year. “It was a little loose, and not too structured. But we were happy with the result,” Hill said. She also went on to mention that “dividing the responsibility” was an important aspect of planning that she learned must be done next time an event like this is executed.
According to attendees, the free food offered ran out about a third of the way into the event. Rene Cuenca, a first-year majoring in policy and management, said, “There was no way of telling who was in Dietrich and who was not.” He went on to comment that throughout the event there was a consistent lack of student participation, which would have strengthened the event and given it a better impact.
Dietrich Pride Day was a learning experience for DiLisio and Hill. In sharing their experiences, they each seemed to allude to future Dietrich College Pride Days, suggesting that it may become an annual event.

An exhibition of resources related to botany and history was held on the fifth floor of Hunt Library this past week, and will continue to be showcased until December. The exhibition featured rare pieces from the Hunt Collection, including some added by Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt. The exhibit is open to all students and visitors for free.
The entire fifth floor of Hunt Library — or the “Penthouse,” as McMasters Miller Hunt referred to it in one of the informational plaques — is used to showcase Hunt’s extensive collection of books on botany and botanists, as well as related archives and research, all of which comprise the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation. The exhibition opened Sept. 16 and will close Dec. 15, giving students and botany enthusiasts alike ample time to see artifacts ranging from hand-painted water colors of rare plants to some of the earliest examples of microscopic observation. 
While perhaps not what the average college student would consider an exciting proposition, there is a surprisingly broad appeal from the exhibit. “The people who come tend to be interested in art, or science, or are ecology students,” said Charlotte Tancin, librarian and principal research scholar at the Hunt Institute. “People go to concerts and museums and galleries as cultural experiences and should approach this in the same spirit.” 
The Hunt Institute has a wide range of resources for Carnegie Mellon students. It features one of the largest collections of Carl Linnaeus, who is known as a father of modern taxonomy; a copy of a Nehemiah Grew study of plants through a microscope; a one-of-a-kind planting calendar from the 1570s; an original woodblock used for illustrations; and an example first edition of one of the first books to be printed in the New World.
According to Tancin, it is unusual for so many rare pieces to be on display at once. “We’d love to have more visitors. Although more students are welcome, we do have closed stacks [for pieces not on display],” she said.
The wood-paneled rooms of the fifth floor provide a studious atmosphere for inspecting the rare works. Those interested in the histories of art, science, printmaking, and even landscape architecture all have reason to make use of the opportunity, although many students who find themselves there do so by mistake. “Students either don’t know we exist,” said Lugene Bruno, curator of art and senior research scholar for the institute, “or are too shy to come up here.”  
Studying plants may not sound exciting to some, but the exhibit portrays Rachael Hunt embarking on adventures into South American rainforests and embroiling herself in pitched bidding wars for rare manuscripts. A prior appreciation for botany is not required to understand the exhibit. 
Group tours of the exhibit are available by appointment.

Steif writes textbook aimed at engineering students
A new textbook has been written by Carnegie Mellon’s Paul S. Steif, a professor of mechanical engineering. The book, titled Mechanics of Materials and published by Pearson, aims to be visually appealing, as it involves depictions of everyday experiences with simple objects. This combination of visuals and simple examples is designed to help students grasp fundamental engineering concepts with ease. According to a press release, Steif hopes to help students relate engineering concepts to many real-world engineered systems, such as wind turbines and devices that physicians use to fix broken bones. When creating the new textbook, Steif focused on visuals and images, a different path than most textbooks follow.
“I wrote a new textbook for engineering students to help demystify the subject and to take an approach more in sync with learning styles of a generation of students who literally grew up on the Internet,” Steif said in a press release.
Mechanics of Materials is being published at a time when government officials are trying to address the nation’s engineering shortages. According to a university press release, the U.S. President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness announced in August that 50 leaders  of companies from Corning Inc. to Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel want to increase the number of engineering internships they offer.
CMU’s Gaynor to head new Health Care Cost Institute 
Heinz College professor Martin Gaynor will serve as chairman of the new Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI). The HCCI, launched Sept. 20, is an independent, nonprofit research initiative. It will give researchers access to data regarding commercial costs and utilization as well as conduct its own research.
Gaynor is the E.J. Barone Professor of Economics and Health Policy in Heinz College. According to a press release, he believes that the HCCI will give researchers access to more data and analysis on what factors drive health care costs, compared to health care currently available through Medicare and Medicaid. The HCCI will record de-personalized data from private insurers Aetna, Humana, Kaiser Permanente, and United Healthcare as well as government data; the organization will then synthesize the data to create its own “scorecards.” These scorecards will be available to researchers by 2012 and will contain analysis on aggregate trends of health care cost and utilization, intended to inform policy decisions.
“HCCI will provide, for the first time, researchers access to data that covers all ages and health issues and is national in scope,” Gaynor said in a CMU press release. “Perhaps most importantly, for the first time there will be comprehensive data on the privately insured who make up the majority of health consumers in the United States.”

Mechanisms of Biological Dynamics Determined from Studies of Virus Particle Maturation
Monday, Sept, 26 at 4:30 p.m. 
Wean Hall 7500
In this lecture, Jack Johnson, head of the structural virology department at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif., will discuss how the accessibility of bacteriophage maturation to structural, biophysical, and genetic methods enhances scientists’ understanding of novel processes in biological dynamics.
His lecture will include identifying mechanisms that create energy landscapes for exothermic virus maturation, as well as discovering a means of directing the effects of thermal fluctuations for particle development through a Brownian ratchet. Johnson will also explain his encoded program, a biological nano-machine, that directs particle maturation.
School of Art Lecture Series
Tuesday, Sept. 27 at 5 p.m.
Kresge Theater, CFA
In this lecture, Nobuho Nagasawa will discuss her various works and life as an artist. Her pieces primarily focus on politics, ecology, and psychology. She uses the medium of site-specific art to incorporate community participation. She also uses in-depth research into cultural history and memory for each piece she creates.
In the field of public art, Nagasawa has been commissioned for more than 25 projects internationally, and has received numerous awards. Most recently, she has been selected to work on a project in downtown Pittsburgh, which makes a connection between the Mon Wharf and Point Park University’s campus.
Nagasawa has an extensive international exhibition record, which includes the Royal Garden of the Prague Castle in the Czech Republic, Ludwig Museums in Germany and Hungary, Rufino Tamayo Museum in Mexico, Alexandria Library in Egypt, and the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles, Calif. in the United States. 
Exploring Impossible Spaces: Practical Illusions in Virtual Reality
Wednesday, Sept. 28 at 4 p.m.
Mauldin Auditorium (Newell-Simon Hall 1305)
Postdoctoral research associate Evan Suma from the University of Southern California will describe experiments with “impossible spaces,” environments that leverage perceptual illusions to relax physical space constraints when walking naturally through a virtual world.
His lecture will begin with an overview of the topic, discussing how natural locomotion is one of the fundamental challenges for immersive virtual environments. His study’s results have shown that these illusions can successfully fool the senses into believing there is an expansive virtual environment despite being in a considerably smaller physical workspace.
Mahatma Gandhi Birthday Celebration
Sunday, Oct. 2 at 3 p.m.
Frick Fine Arts Auditorium, University of Pittsburgh
This Sunday is Gandhi Jayanti, the national holiday celebrated in India to mark Mahatma Gandhi’s birthday. This event will celebrate Gandhi as a global humanitarian figure with cultural performances, interfaith presentations, and a talk by Uma Majmudar, a Gandhian researcher and published author. Majmudar’s lecture will be titled “Gandhi’s Legacy of ‘Satyagraha’ in the Modern World.” In her talk, she will answer such questions as what “Satyagraha” is, whether it involves passive resistance or civil disobedience, how Gandhi coined this term, and what it meant to him.
Majmudar’s most famous work is her novel Gandhi’s Pilgrimage of Faith: From Darkness to Light.

Medical
Sept. 18, 2011
Carnegie Mellon Police and EMS were called to Morewood Gardens at 3:18 a.m. for a student who had punched a mirror and cut his hand.  The student denied being under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and stated that he’d had a bad day and lost his temper. He was transported to UPMC Shadyside Hospital.
Harassment by Communication
Sept. 18, 2011
At 11:33 p.m., a student reported that he had received a series of anonymous calls from a blocked number, in which the caller was claiming that the iPhone belonging to the student was the caller’s and had been stolen. The caller threatened the victim and, in one of the calls, purported to be a Pittsburgh Police officer. University Police contacted Pittsburgh Police and learned that their agency was not involved. The victim was advised not to give out any information and to contact his phone company to block future calls from that source.
Theft
Sept. 19, 2011
University Police received a report that an Entropy+ employee was involved in a theft of over $600 from the establishment. A detective followed up on the case and obtained a signed confession. Theft charges were filed.
Vehicle Accident
Sept. 19, 2011
At 11:33 p.m., Carnegie Mellon Police were dispatched to Fifth Avenue and Bouquet Street for a report that a dark-colored SUV had sideswiped a shuttle bus and fled the scene. The driver and the student passenger were not injured, and the bus suffered minimal damage. The SUV suffered a broken rear-door window. The vehicle was not located.
Fire
Sept. 20, 2011
At 6:20 a.m., Carnegie Mellon Police and the Pittsburgh Fire Department responded to the FMS Building due to a fire in one of the chiller motors at the facility. The fire was extinguished and there were no injuries.
Harassment 
Sept. 20, 2011
A female student reported to University Police that at 11:52 p.m., she was walking on Fifth Avenue when an old, brown vehicle pulled alongside her and stopped. The three occupants, whom she described as scroungy, bald white males, stared at her but did not say anything. The student turned around and walked back toward Morewood Avenue. The vehicle followed her and pulled into her path as it turned into the loading dock area of the building located at 5000 Fifth Ave. The student ran across the street into Mudge House and contacted University Police. A search of the area by police proved negative.
Attempted Fraud
Sept. 22, 2011
At 10:18 a.m., a student came to the Carnegie Mellon Police station to report that he had been the intended victim of a fraud. The student had responded to a job ad on TartanTrak for a company called Prime Evaluators, Inc. The student was later contacted by a person posing as a company representative, who told him that he had been selected to participate in a “test transaction.” The caller explained that the student would receive a FedEx package in the mail with a check from an unknown company. The student was told to deposit the check and send 90 percent of the proceeds to a specified party via Western Union and keep 10 percent as his commission. Investigation showed the check to be counterfeit. No loss was suffered by the intended victim.

For anyone who hasn’t heard the news yet, an international team of researchers in Italy has recently released results from an experiment that showed sub-atomic particles traveling faster than the speed of light. These scientists launched 15,000 neutrino packets from Geneva, Switzerland to Gran Sasso, Italy over a three-year period. In a violation of Einstein’s relativity theory, which states that nothing travels faster than the speed of light, these particles arrived 60 nanoseconds faster than they should have been able to.
“Faster Than Light Particles Could Wreck Einstein’s Relativity Theory,” one source headlined. “Speed of light ‘broken’: life changing scientific discoveries,” another said. “'Faster than light’ particles threaten Einstein.” All of these headlines are designed to grab attention, and they succeed at it. None of them are technically wrong, and yet I still feel the need to criticize them.
These headlines, and in many cases the actual articles that accompany the headlines, convey the message that a paradigm shift — a fundamental change in basic assumptions within the ruling theory of science — is occurring as a result of this experiment. The headlines insinuate that this experiment has turned Einstein’s theory of relativity, which states that nothing in the universe can travel faster than the speed of light, on its head. But any scientist knows that one single experiment cannot induce such a drastic shift in a fundamental theory. It takes years or even decades for enough experiments to be performed for scientists to be completely confident in such a result worthy of a paradigm shift.
Not all of us are scientists — I get that — but that’s exactly the point. Those unfamiliar with a particular subject matter need an information source that doesn’t twist facts or stretch the truth to gain attention, because oftentimes that twist undermines the real story trying to be told. I’m certainly not claiming that I can solve the disconnect between the public and the science community. However, I do feel that blowing things out of proportion to gain readership is not the correct way to solve it.
The recent light-speed violation and the resulting portrayal of the story by the mass media brought these issues to light for me. I don’t outright deny the results of the study, but to say that Einstein was wrong just because one set of experimental results came out differently than physicists expected is a massive stretch. Sure, maybe several years down the road, independent experiments will see the same thing: particles breaking the universal speed limit in multiple laboratories. But only then can we really call this is a truly historic event, and only then can we really question fundamental science.
Of course, I’m focusing on the bad coverage here. There are some media outlets that do a fine job at communicating important, interesting science. 
But it only takes a few exaggerations, a twisted fact here or a stretch of truth there, to get a large number of people to believe in something that isn’t necessarily true, creating a disconnect between the original result of a scientific study and the general public who needs to be informed of such events.

The recently held Dietrich Pride Day and similar previous events (such as those hosted by H&SS Connect) have already been used to try and unify the newly named Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences’ multidisciplinary students under one banner. This year, attendance at Dietrich Pride Day was lacking, and with good reason. 
The event suffered from quickly depleted food supplies, a decrease in giveaways from previous years’ events, and a poorly fitted venue. It needed serious improvement on behalf of the students it aimed to represent — and a serious boost in dignity. Furthermore, these symptoms indicate that there are deeper issues lying beneath the surface.
H&SS has always been the “grab bag” college, where students can pursue any degree from statistics and English to information systems and cognitive science. 
With this great range of diversity comes a lack of focus, and the college is put in the difficult position of trying to define itself in unifying terms. “Humanities” and “social sciences” have been stretched beyond recognition as labels for the college’s many majors. 
In addition, H&SS faces the problem of being a liberal arts college in the midst of a university where liberal arts degrees are not taken as seriously. 
Stereotypes about the college seem to have been around since time immemorial. That H&SS is a “last choice” college, and that many of its students are in it because they failed to get into the schools they originally wanted, are just two examples of these pervasive stereotypes. The shirts handed out at the event proclaiming that H&SS is “a great choice” merely encourage untrue characterizations. 
Of course, these caricatures don’t hold true; in fact, students in H&SS complete an education that allows them to pull from the best parts of other colleges on campus while enjoying the benefits of a classically modeled core. H&SS is one of the largest colleges at Carnegie Mellon; the administration not only fails to pay attention to the college and capitalize on its strengths, but in doing so essentially snubs a large part of the university’s student population. Perhaps the food shortages and lack of giveaways were really from the lack of funding that H&SS receives from the university. With more funding and attention given to H&SS programs, the college can truly start to build an identity.
Rather than seeking to fix these underlying issues — no singular academic goal, no “anchor” by which to identify its students — the college’s administration has again and again chosen to apply only topical remedies, of which Dietrich Pride Day is one such case. If the organizers of these events — and of the college in general — worked together to create a singular, branded identity for the school, it would be something to rally behind. 
Before students can be proud to be part of a unified H&SS, they need something to be proud of.
Meela Dudley has recused herself from this article due to her involvement in H&SS Connect.

I try to avoid public bathrooms at all costs, usually for the same reasons you do. When I can’t avoid them, I make sure that the process is as swift and painless as possible. The inclusion of automated devices in bathrooms, including the bathrooms in the University Center, should aid in this process, yet upon further inspection they waste both time and resources. Let me go on to explain (in not too much detail) how they affect your public bathroom experience. 
You enter the UC bathroom with your objectives in mind: find a stall, take care of bathroom activities, clean up, and get out. Now from my experience, as soon as you enter a stall, the automatic toilet paper dispenser will activate because you are standing in front of it. Preemptive measures are fine, unless the toilet paper was already hanging down recklessly and is now touching the bathroom floor.
No, thank you.
Already the automated services of the bathroom have not only made things awkward, but have also wasted that once-usable piece of toilet paper. So you take care of business. After that is over, you have to deal with this automatic toilet dispenser again. You act cordially and give it a wave, until you realize that the sensor isn’t where you were flailing your hands. Now that the sensor is located, you have a fresh supply of toilet paper.
Here’s where things get tricky. You may not have realized it, but there is a sensor on the toilet that has been watching you since you entered the stall. It has been watching you. After the shivers dissipate, you realize it received a degree from the Automatic Toilet Paper Dispenser School of Inappropriate Timing and starts flushing too early. What was once an opportunity to finish bathroom activities at your own pace is now an adrenaline-fueled race to take care of business. Being stressed with your pants around your ankles is not fun.
More often than not you lose the race and now you have to flush again. While the wasted water from two flushes per one bathroom activity is a travesty, you have hands to wash. Once you have soap and start washing your hands, you begin to think of how much spare water funnels down the drain from the time you are ready to dry to when the faucet finally stops running. You think about when everything in your life became automatic and when you stopped making your own decisions. You think, “I should stop philosophizing and dry my hands now,” and step up to use one of the hand dryers. You may not have any skin left on your hands after they’ve spent ten seconds under the F-18 powered dryer, but now you can finally leave the bathroom.
However, the damage is done. Water, paper, and time have been wasted in your response to nature’s calling. While automatic bathroom devices were designed to improve lavatory efficiency, they often make the experience less efficient. Forsake automation and take matters into your own hands. Just make sure to wash them afterwards.

According to the National Taxpayers Union, the top 25 percent of American earners pay 86 percent of income taxes, while the bottom 50 percent of American earners pay no relative income tax. 
This system, called progressive taxation, taxes the wealthy more than the lower and middle classes because of the belief that the wealthy don’t deserve sovereign power over their income and that the government knows best how to spend money in a way that achieves social good. I believe that this system is wrong and that anyone who fairly earns any amount of money deserves every penny of it.
To make money, an individual has to offer a good or service to society. The value of that good or service is determined by the market, which can be described as everyone who has ever made a purchasing decision. In other words, people make money by offering the fruits of their labor to the public, which then determines the value of each person’s good or service. In order for someone to become a billionaire, they must offer something that society deems worthy of a billion dollars. Bill Gates, for example, became the richest man in the world because he created Microsoft, which offered goods that society determined to be of high value. 
So, in buying what Microsoft makes, each and every one of us has helped Bill Gates become one of the richest men in the world. Gates didn’t earn his money unfairly; he merely increased global utility by an astronomical amount, and society ‘rewarded’ him with an astronomical amount of money. Because society makes the wealthy, I believe that the wealthy have no additional enforceable monetary obligation to society. In a sense, this obligation has already been paid because the wealthy person in question gave society a valuable good or service.
Many say that those who became rich were only able to do so because the United States has a stable society with effective markets, which is the result of each member of society following laws and contributing to constructive societal practices. People who disagree with me argue that the wealthy would have made nothing without this social structure, and therefore should be forced to give back. I, however, believe that the wealthy pay this debt just like anyone else by contributing to our safe, constructive society. It is equally advantageous for every member of society regardless of income to interact positively with others. It works as much in your favor as in Gates’ to follow laws and contribute to a non-anarchistic society. 
This is akin to guaranteeing the pursuit of happiness. Regardless of whether or not happiness is attained, everyone is guaranteed an equality of opportunity, but not equality of outcome. All men are created equal, but they don’t all end up that way. Belief in this argument necessitates the logical conclusion that everyone who earns money does it fairly and deserves sovereign power over all of it. This leads to belief in a flat income tax rate. I believe that a flat income tax rate is the only way to respect and acknowledge the contributions that people make to society through commerce. Yet many would argue that a flat tax rate allows the wealthy to be selfish, to take their money and use it only for their benefit. I believe that man is inherently good, and that this is not the eventuality of a flat income tax rate. I urge everyone to consider guaranteeing equality of opportunity instead of equality of results by voting to equalize the income tax rate. 
After all, the existence of great wealth leaves us all something aspire to, which makes the world a little more interesting.

Who lives in a pineapple under the sea? Come on, you know the answer. SpongeBob SquarePants! Absorbent and yellow and porous is he! SpongeBob Squ — sorry, maybe that was a little too fast-paced.
A study from the University of Virginia published in Pediatrics this week concluded that the cartoon SpongeBob SquarePants impairs children’s “executive functions.” It’s Pediatrics’ big day — with articles about things like “Adjunctive Oral Methylprednisolone in Pediatric Acute Pyelonephritis,” which alleviates renal scarring, it’s not often that the magazine’s findings relate to people on a personal level. And so I don’t want to rain on Pediatrics’ parade, but let’s face it: SpongeBob is an awesome show, and its pacing doesn’t hurt anyone.
During the study, researchers divided 60 four-year-olds into three groups. One group colored, one group watched part of a SpongeBob episode, and one group watched part of an episode of an educational PBS show called Caillou, which is about a kid who goes to preschool. Then the kids had to do four tasks to test their “executive functions.” A Towers of Hanoi problem tested their working memory. Touching their head when the researcher said to touch their toes (and vice versa) tested their self-regulation. Repeating strings of digits backward tested their working memory capacity. And waiting to eat some marshmallows in order to be allotted more tested their delay of gratification. 
The kids who watched SpongeBob scored significantly lower on these tests than the other groups. And thus, according to the study, fast-paced television has immediate negative effects.
There are many things about this research that rubbed me the wrong way. For one, they tested four-year-olds, who are too young to grasp SpongeBob’s pungent cultural commentary. For another, they don’t justify wanting to test for immediate results, even though other long-term television studies have already been done. But I’d like to focus on the researchers’ main oversight: they weren’t really comparing fast-paced TV to slow-paced TV. If so, they would’ve used fast-paced and slow-paced sequences from the same program. A study they reference looked into that, by the way, and found that there was no difference in skills afterward. Instead, they compared an interesting show to a boring show. Obviously, the kids wanted to use their executive functions less after being torn away from the interesting show.
Imagine if they tried to do a study like that to you. You go into this awesome office, they give you a juicebox or something, and get you settled in. Heck, they can even call your mom to have her rate your general attention span like they did in the real study. Eventually, they hook you up with James Bond and then randomly turn it off and tell you to touch your toes, but only if — wait for it — they tell you to touch your head. You tell me if you wouldn’t tell them where to put their executive functions.
On the other hand, maybe they show you some lame movie like The Village (you didn’t like that movie, did you?), mercifully shut it off after a while, and then tell you to do some things. You’re primed to do whatever they want because you’re having a terrible time and you’re not focused on the TV program. 
Boring and educational is good for docility, but when you watch something to have a good time and to engage in it, you’re probably not that interested in doing serious activities afterward — preschool-aged or otherwise. But if people are looking for TV to be harmful, they’ll probably find it. “The only people who don’t like a Krabby Patty have never tasted one!”

In an outcome that surprised no one, Pennsylvania’s ill-designed experiment with supermarket wine kiosks came to an end last Tuesday. The kiosks, which were effectively wine vending machines, were abandoned by the state Liquor Control Board after one year and a net loss of $1.1 million. Shoppers wanting to purchase wine can no longer do so at local supermarket vendors and must go to a state-operated wine and spirits store.
Of course, judging by the roughly $1.1 million operating shortfall the machines have left in their wake, the process of using the kiosks was too complicated. The wine kiosks are 10-foot behemoths that would make Rube Goldberg proud. Suppose that, as a legal, responsible, sober adult, you wanted to buy the ingredients to cook dinner. You go to Giant Eagle, look at your shopping list, pick up some chicken breasts, mushrooms, and olive oil. Next on the list: a bottle of marsala. You walk up to the kiosk and find the bottle you want on the touchpad. The machine then asks you to swipe your ID. Then you’re asked to blow into a breathalyzer. Finally, you are made to look into a surveillance camera mounted in the kiosk. If a state employee in Harrisburg is satisfied with your identification and lack of inebriation, and the machine is working that day (closed Sundays, holidays, and outside of working hours), you get your bottle of wine.
Since these procedures were devised by the same state that has what even the Associated Press called “some of the most Byzantine liquor laws in the U.S.,” we are hardly surprised by their failure. It’s notoriously difficult to obtain a liquor license in Pennsylvania. Furthermore, over 30 states allow regular beer and wine sales in grocery stores, and Pennsylvania is one of only four states in which the state control board has authority over wine. (The other three states are New Hampshire, Utah, and Wyoming.)
If Pennsylvania’s legislators truly cared about trusting their consumers to make choices for themselves, they would reform and update the state’s archaic liquor laws to bring them more in line with the rest of the country. 
If they do not, we will continue to see many more costly and embarrassing mistakes like these failed wine kiosks.

My freshman year, a student asked Jared Cohon, “Why doesn’t CMU offer financial aid to international students?” Jared Cohon replied, “Well, there is some logic to that. We are an American university.” The student brought up an excellent point. The top 15 universities are located in either the United States or the United Kingdom. If we look at the top 20, we add Switzerland, Canada, and Australia. And so on...
Very few students can afford Carnegie Mellon’s tuition without financial aid. The average financial aid package for a Carnegie Mellon student is over $30,000, and America is the richest country in the world. So why is the luxury of a Carnegie Mellon education made affordable only to Americans?
If all universities followed Carnegie Mellon’s example, we could expect only those who reside in wealthy countries to have a top-of-the-line education.
According to Jared Cohon, this is because Carnegie Mellon is an American university.
American, as used here, literally means residing in the United States. I am an American because I was lucky enough to be born in this wealthy country. An equally accurate description of me would be human. As a human, I see no reason why a Carnegie Mellon education should only be accessible to those who win the pre-birth lottery.
Like Jared Cohon, I believe that Carnegie Mellon should lead by example. However, it is just as important that Carnegie Mellon set the right example. Given the recent celebrations concerning Bill Dietrich’s $265 million donation, I think the time is right to establish financial aid for international students.

Think twice about the gifts you buy your roommates. What may seem like a neat thing that tickles their fancy could end up being your worst nightmare.
Let your artistic side run wild this week by creating something with your hands. Start small with finger paint, then work your way up.
You have been a lot more sarcastic these past few weeks, Cancer, but watch your step. Someone unexpected might call your bluff this week.
Someone taller and funnier than you would like you to know that mastering fundamentals is key to doing anything well. Learn them or stay sucky forever.
Hey, thanks for getting people sick!
A shorter, more sarcastic person would like you to fix your face, and wants you to know that until you master fundamentals, you will be nothing.
You’re bad to the bone, a rebel without a cause, and really, a Scorpio without a clue. Lose the acting and just be yourself. 
Stop feeding your ego by twisting positive feedback others give you. Being humble is actually a good thing.
Control your emotions and think more logically this week. Give your heart a break and outsource some stress to that brain of yours.
I promise that one day very soon you will be able to read for pleasure and not just for class.
You suck because you’re not sick.
