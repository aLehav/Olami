It’s that time of year again. And by that time, I mean anytime Aaron Rodgers has to think about his career. The NFL quarterback, most known for his high-level play in his career, his victory in Super Bowl XLV, and his four NFL Most Valuable Player awards, has had a lot of speculation going into this off season, with the Green Bay Packers rumored to be trading him to one of several teams. I’m not entirely sure what the Packers' thought process is, but considering the teams demonic luck in finding Hall of Fame quarterback play, I’d be very scared of what the team is planning. Sure, Jordan Love looks kinda disappointing right now, but maybe the Packers are gonna shove some Super Soldier Serum up his ass and turn him into Captain Football.
And yes, I know the Bears are terrified of another HoF Packers QB. I’m sorry Bears, I really do hope the bad man leaves soon, and I really hope you can figure out how to pass the ball soon.
Of course, Aaron Rodgers, one of the saner and better put together quarterbacks in the league, has decided to handle the rumors by disappearing into a darkness retreat for four days. 
Yep. Absolute and complete darkness. According to Rodgers, it’s just like taking DMT, but without the DMT and … anything else. Rodgers is essentially gonna go sit in time out for a couple days to figure out where he’s planning on going.
Rodgers has been reported (by me) to have said “Bro it’s like being in heaven without the Ayahuasca. I’m planning on getting extra big portions through the feeding tube in case the Hat Man shows up.” The Hat Man being a frequent character in Rodgers' trips, as well as the 12th man Rodgers was targeting on this play against San Francisco.
The rest of the NFL waits with bated breath as teams scramble to sell enough souls to find cap space for Rodgers' finicky contract, and teams who claim to be "one QB away’" cough Colts cough are scrambling to figure out how to grab that one quarterback.
In terms of teams that might actually land him, eyes really land on the New York Football Jets, the Al Davis Raiders, and the Washington Communists. 
Washington is currently in the process of selling the team, maybe, possibly, perhaps, depending on whether or not Dan Snyder gets enough of an ego boost from the sale. With the team's future in uncertain waters, as well as a new offensive coordinator in Eric Bieniemy, Washington could use a stable veteran to right the ship. At the same time, Sam Howell is currently undefeated, and may never be defeated again, so who knows what the team plans on doing.
Meanwhile, the Raiders have buried themselves in so much cap space they might actually have the opportunity to be good next season. This is gonna be their year, I can feel it. Just like every year since 2002.
But seriously, the Raiders are doing really, really good in terms of cap space. Getting rid of Carr has left them with almost $50 million in space, which may increase as the offseason continues. They’re in third place, behind the Falcons and Bears, though the Bears already have a solution for a quarterback in the coming season. For the Raiders, picking up a solid QB in Rodgers could help them make some waves, though I doubt Rodgers wants to play in a division with Mahomes, Justin Herbert’s media team, and Mr. Bad Charity. If he does go to the Raiders, they did have a top 10 offensive line closing out the 2022 season, and that might give Rodgers the time and space to make those dime throws that won him MVP in the 2020 and 2021.
Finally, there is everyone’s "favorite" team, the New York Jetropolitan Rugby Club. After a disastrous season behind Zach “I love everyone’s mother” Wilson and Mike “I swear I’m a good QB” White, the Jets missed out on a postseason berth, continuing their streak since 2010. It’s a pretty disastrous finish for a team that drafted second overall, only to bust on the Mormon Mother’s Man out of BYU. While the Jets didn’t have much on defense, in the few games that White or Wilson did do well in, it seems like they have the rest of the weapons necessary to make Rodgers good, and more importantly, they were one win away from making the postseason this year over Seattle. Rodgers might have made the difference in one of the many games the Jets threw away this year, and given a good returning receiving core, we could see the Jets snap one of the longest playoff droughts in NFL history. 
However, the real issue for a lot of these teams is a lack of long-term planning. Neither the Raiders nor the Commanders have a good long term plan at QB, and Rodgers would only really serve as a stop gap, not a QB to build a team around. With both teams facing tough divisions, not having consistent winning may be a serious problem, and without the faith that Rodgers will still be here, basically ever, it’s hard to see the Raiders or the Commies make the commitment to him. I’ve heard Washington is even trying to get in touch with the cartels for all of Rodgers’ favorite drugs.
Personally? I see Rodgers going to the Jets. As much as it’s funny to clown on the team, they do deserve to see January again, and I’d love to see the team see a little bit more winning. Not too much winning, but just a little bit. With how bad they’ve drafted, giving up those picks is probably a good thing, and they could give the Jets the ability to pay attention to winning instead of trying to rebuild year on year. With White and Wilson, two capable backups. Rodgers could have a pretty secure job, and when it comes to future returns, sitting Zach “Stacy’s Mom was my girlfriend” Wilson could help the Jets out. Wilson could get a lot of experience sitting behind Rodgers, taking a few DMT trips with him, and finding out the real hot single in his area was him all along.

As of Feb. 20, my most dearly beloved Tristan Jarry has finally made his way back onto the ice. He started in the net Monday against the Islanders, Thursday against the Oilers, and Saturday against the Blues. Unfortunately, his triumphant return did not start out so triumphant; despite making 28 saves against the Islanders on Monday, New York emerged triumphant with a final score of 4-2. In his defense, I’ll argue that the last shot was made at the very end of the game, after Jarry had been pulled from the net for an extra skater. Jarry similarly struggled on Tuesday, and was eventually replaced by Casey DeSmith in the third period after letting in six shots for the Oilers, leading to a harrowing 7-2 loss. In a genuinely shocking turn of events, the Penguins were finally able to pull out an overtime Peng-win against the Blues, 3-2. Jarry made 25 saves in that game. I’m hoping that Jarry continues to improve as he gets back into the swing of things, but as of right now there’s nothing we can do but wait and see. The Pens are currently in the running for the wildcard slot in the playoffs, but their position is not stable — if we want to make it into the postseason, Jarry needs to get back in the groove, and fast. Pittsburgh is also slated to go up against Nashville on Tuesday, Tampa (again) on Thursday, and the Florida Panthers on Saturday.

Men’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team hosted 14th-ranked Case Western Reserve on Saturday for their final regular game of the season. 
The Tartans pulled ahead early, claiming the first six points of the game. However, Case Western responded with a 20-3 run in, which put the score at 20-9 with 12:18 left in play. Carnegie Mellon responded with a run of their own, scoring 20 to the Spartans’ five, which put the Tartans ahead, 29-25. Though Case Western took the lead one more time before the end of the half, Carnegie Mellon pulled ahead once more before the clock hit zero, 45-42.
Going into the second half, the Tartans extended their lead thanks to a 9-3 run, which put them nine points ahead of the Spartans, 54-45, with just over 16 minutes left in play. Their lead, however, was narrowed until the Spartans took a narrow lead that led to a 67-all tie. The Tartans weren’t able to capitalize on this, though, as Case Western completed a 14-4 run with 5:46 left in play. Though the Tartans were behind by 10, they attempted a comeback that put them within three points in the last minute of the game. The Tartans were unsuccessful in their comeback and lost the game, 91-95. 
This loss put the Tartans at 15-10 overall and 7-7 in conference play for the regular season. The men’s basketball team will find out if they will be continuing into postseason play during the afternoon on Monday, Feb. 27. 
Women’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team closed out their regular season this past week when they hosted the Case Western Reserve Spartans at home on Saturday, Feb. 26. 
The game started off slow, with neither team recording points until nearly two minutes into the game when Case Western sunk two free throws. Case Western scored three points after, but a 7-3 Tartans run put Carnegie Mellon ahead 9-7 six minutes into the first quarter. At the end of the first quarter, the Tartans were still in the lead, 20-16. In the second quarter, the Tartans continued their momentum; at one point, Carnegie Mellon held a 13 point lead, but Case Western Reserve scored eight in a row, which put the score at 39-34 in favor of the Tartans at the end of the first half. 
Moving into the second half, the Tartans opened with two more points thanks to a layup from sophomore Catherine Or. The third quarter would also be the first time that Case Western outscored the Tartans, 22-15. At the end of the third quarter, the Tartans were slightly behind the Spartans, 56-54. Just under three minutes into the final frame, the Tartans took back the lead from the Spartans, which lead to the leads eventually being within one point of each other. The Tartans then pulled away from Case Western and finished the game 10 points ahead, 79-69.
This victory put the women’s basketball team at 12-13 overall and 3-11 in conference play for the regular season. 
Men’s Tennis
The 23rd-ranked Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team hosted Washington College this past Saturday, Feb. 26 at Lakevue Athletic Club in Valencia, Pa. 
In doubles play, the Tartans took two wins to Washington’s one. The duo of senior Raahil Doshi and junior Jaden D’Abrero took an 8-6 win in the third spot for the Tartans’ first point while the pair of junior Derek Wong and first-year Akshay Joshi claimed the Tartans’ second point in the second spot. 
In singles play, three Tartans took victories. In the fourth spot, senior Matthew Poh won his sets 6-4, 6-3. In the fifth spot, Joshi claimed victory with winning sets of 6-1, 7-5. D’Abreo won in the sixth spot with sets of 6-4, 6-0. 
The combined five points from the Tartans put them on top and advanced them to 2-2 on the season. The Tartans will next take on Davenport when they travel to Orlando, Fla. on Friday, March 3. 
Women’s Tennis
The 11th-ranked Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team traveled to Wooster, Ohio for two matches on Saturday, Feb. 15 for matches against Otterbein University and College of Wooster. 
In doubles play against Otterbein, all three pairs took the win. The pair of senior Danna Taylor and sophomore Crystal Zhou took an 8-0 victory; the duo of first-year Anna Chow and first-year Divya Venkatarama also swept, taking an 8-0 victory; the final pair of first-year Anika Joshi and first-year Manuela Van Cotthem took the win, 8-2.
Singles play mirrored the Tartans’ success in doubles against Otterbein. Sophomore Sarah Yang won her sets 6-1, 6-3. Zhou swept her sets, 6-0, 6-0. Venkatarama won both her sets, 6-0, 6-0. Van Cotthem also swept her sets, 6-0, 6-0. Joshi also found success, winning her sets 6-1, 6-0. Chow, in the sixth spot, also took the win, 6-1, 6-3. 
The Tartans also swept Wooster in doubles play. The pair of Taylor and Zhou won 8-1; the pair of Yang and sophomore Zoe Angell won as well, 8-3; in the third spot, the duo of Van Cotthem and Venkatarama took their set, 8-2. 
In singles play, Taylor won her sets 6-0, 6-2. In the second spot, Vankatarama took the win, 6-3, 6-1. Angell swept in the third spot, 6-0, 6-0. Van Cotthem found similar success, winning her sets 6-2, 6-1. In the fifth spot, Joshi claimed the win, 6-2, 6-0. In the sixth spot, Chow won, 6-1, 6-0. 
These two 9-0 victories have placed the Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team at 7-1 for the season. They will next be playing in their 14th straight ITA National Team Indoor Championship, which begins on Friday, March 3 in Lexington, Ky. The Tartans will open play against the second-ranked University of Chicago. 
Men’s Swimming and Diving
Five members of the Carnegie Mellon men’s diving team headed to the 2023 NCAA Division III Region 4 Diving Championships on Friday, Feb. 24 and Saturday, Feb. 25 at Ithaca College.

The Major League Baseball season concluded in November as the Astros toppled the Phillies in six games to claim the World Series title. Baseball once again returned to hibernation for the cold winter months. Winter turns to spring and the baseball season takes its place once more. This year, though, is slightly different. Before we can watch our favorite teams go to battle, a special tournament will commence. The World Baseball Classic allows players to suit up for their national teams and play for their country. Twenty nations will send their best players to claim the coveted trophy.
The history of the World Baseball Classic (WBC) is rather short. Its first iteration took place in 2006, and there have only been four tournaments since. With each passing classic, it seems the tournament grows in popularity and that trend is almost sure to continue. The WBC is key to help grow the game of baseball and spread it even further worldwide. Baseball is a major sport in many nations, including the United States, Japan, South Korea, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, but it lacks popularity in other regions. An international tournament showcases the best players on the planet playing, not for money, but for national pride. In the previous events, Japan, the Dominican Republic, and the U.S. are the only nations to win. Japan won the first two tournaments in 2006 and 2009 while the Dominican Republic and the U.S. won the WBCs of 2013 and 2017, respectively. 
This year's World Baseball Classic is shaping up to be a great tournament with some nations making their first appearance and others looking to add to their trophy case. The 20 national teams are split up into four different pools. The first round is pool play where five teams will play each other. The top two teams with the best record will move on to the next round. From then on, every game is win or go home. In the quarterfinals, the winner of Pool A will play the second place team of Pool B and the winner of Pool B will play the runner up of Pool A. The same is true for Pools C and D, but on the other side of the bracket. The winners will move on to the semifinals and so on until the final game on Tuesday, March 21 in Miami, Florida. 
The games of Pool A will take place in Taiwan at the Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium. This is one of the weaker pools of the field, as it includes Chinese Taipei (Taiwan), the Netherlands, Cuba, Italy, and Panama. Chinese Taipei will be led by Yueh-Ping Lin in their fifth appearance at the WBC. This squad does not have many big leaguers besides a few players who had quick trips to the big leagues or prospects who have yet to reach that level, but they certainly have experience in the WBC. They have only reached the second round once, so they sure have something to prove to the rest of the world. 
The Netherlands is being led by Hensley Meulens in their fifth trip to the WBC. They have been one of the more successful nations in the first few tournaments, as they finished fourth in each of the last two. They field a number of MLB players such as Xander Bogaerts, Kenley Jansen, Jurickson Profar, and Andrelton Simmons. Pitching is likely the biggest concern for this team, but they have shown to have some magic when it matters most. 
Armando Johnson leads the Cuban National team, which is an easy favorite to win Pool A. For the first time, Cuba is allowing players who defected from the country to play for their national team. This will hopefully give them the spark they have been looking for, as the team has been unable to get past the second round since their defeat in the 2006 Championship to Japan. White Sox teammates Yoan Moncada and Luis Robert Jr. will join Johnson in leading the team, with former MLB star Yoenis Cespedes also on the roster. The pitching looks a little lighter than expected, but many of these players are fresh off the Caribbean Series, so there is little rust to wear off. 
Hall of Fame Catcher Mike Piazza leads Team Italy in their fifth appearance at the WBC. Italy has only made it past the first round once. Royals star first baseman Vinnie Pasquantino, also nicknamed the "Pasquatch" or the "Italian Nightmare," should be fun to watch. Former Mets ace Matt Harvey, as well as David Fletcher and Nicky Lopez, are other notable names. This team lacks the star pitching on paper, which is a similar problem of most WBC teams, but they could make some noise in a weaker pool. 
The last team of Pool A is Panama, who are making their third WBC appearance and first since 2009. Luis Ortiz leads this club, which has very little MLB experience. Javy Guerra and Christian Bethancourt are familiar names, but this team will need some unlikely heroes for a deep run. It should be exciting for Panamanians to see their national team playing on the world stage for the first time in over a decade. 
Cuba will likely move on from Pool A, but the second spot is certainly up for grabs. Chinese Taipei would be my choice for the second slot as they will be playing at home, so the crowd will be on their side. 
Pool B will play their first games at the Tokyo Dome in Japan. Japan, Korea, Australia, China, and Czech Republic make up this section of the tourney. Japan is easily one of the favorites to win the WBC, as they have been the most successful country in its history. They are the only nation to finish in the top three of each WBC, and they have the roster to do it again. The Nippon Professional Baseball Organization is the best outside of Major League Baseball, so there are many high level players on this team. Yu Darvish, Lars Nootbar, and Seiya Suzuki are well known MLB players on the squad, while Munetaka Murakami and Roki Sasaki are young Japanese stars who will look to make their mark. It also cannot be forgotten that two-way player Shohei Ohtani will also suit up for Japan. 
South Korea is also one of the favorites in this tournament, as Korea also has their own league in the Korean Baseball Organization League. They finished in the top three in 2006 and 2009, but have failed to reach the second round since. Kang Chul Lee leads this team of ball players who may not have the notable MLB talent of other squads, but they are sure to be competitive. Some key names are Tommy Edman and Ha-Seong Kim who will provide some key leadership in the infield. 
Former big leaguer Dave Nilsson is leading Team Australia. Unfortunately, they have never made it out of the group stage in the four appearances. The club this time around does also not seem to be as strong as it has been in the past. The roster includes some guys who have big league experience, but there are not a lot of names that are recognizable. 
Similar to Australia, China has never made it out of the pool stage of the World Baseball Classic. Dean Treanor leads this squad, which does not have many notable players on the roster. Additionally, the Chinese Professional Baseball League has not resumed since the pandemic. Hopefully, they can be competitive in the tournament. 
The Czech Republic is one of the more exciting stories of the entire WBC, as they are making their first appearance in the event. Pavel Chadim leads a squad full of guys who mostly play for a Czechian Amateur League. Eric Sogard is the only former big leaguer on the team, but it should be a lot of fun to see this team play. This is another sign that we could be seeing baseball grow in other parts of the world. Although Czech Republic is a great story, Japan and Korea are the easy options to escape Pool B considering their talent and pedigree in the WBC. 
Pool C will play their games in Phoenix, Arizona. Pool C is one of the more interesting pools, as it includes the U.S., Mexico, Colombia, Canada, and Great Britain. The United States is looking to repeat, and it surely has one of the best lineups ever constructed in baseball history. The roster is full of MVPs, including Mookie Betts, Mike Trout, and Paul Goldschmidt, with also a number of other MLB All Stars at each position. The pitching staff is not as comparable, but there are a lot of great pitchers on the roster. The coaching staff also features Mark Derosa, Andy Pettitte, and Hall of Famer Ken Griffey Jr. Everything seems to be lining up for a U.S. repeat at the WBC. 
Mexico is managed by Benji Gil and features a lot of MLB talent. Julio Urias, José Urquidy, and Taijuan Walker lead the pitching staff and there are a number of MLB players around the diamond. Alex Verdugo, Randy Arozarena, and Rowdy Tellez provide thump to the lineup. This team looks like they can compete at a high level and give almost any other squad a run for their money. Mexico is very well rounded and a country with such talent should be moving past the first round which they have not done since 2009. 
Jolbert Cabrera leads Colombia, who are only making their second appearance at the World Baseball Classic. This team is not as star-studded as the others, but there are a lot of good players that could contribute to a winning club. José Quintana, Gio Urshela, and Donovan Solano are good players at the big league level and it would only take a few more pieces for this team to win a game or two. Fifteen-year MLB veteran Ernie Whitt is hoping to coach Canada to their first second round appearance in their WBC history. Similar to most teams, the pitching staff does not jump off the page, but the lineup has some studs. Freddie Freeman is the clear best player, but Tyler O’neil and Abraham Toro are nice pieces. 
Great Britain is another nation making their first appearance in the WBC. Most of their club seems to be players who were born outside of Britain. They are only one of three national teams from Europe, and it would be great to see them win a game. It will also be fun to see the U.S. and Great Britain face off after they played each other in the World Cup just a few months ago. The United States and Mexico are the two clear best teams of Pool C, but Colombia could be a team that could sneak its way into the next round. 
Pool D is probably the best group of the bunch, as it features three very good teams. Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, Israel, and Nicaragua will all play in Miami, Florida at LoanDepot Park. Israel had a fun WBC in 2017, as they finished sixth in their first ever appearance, but they may have drawn the wrong ticket this time around considering the other teams. Ian Kinsler is leading this team and he was a part of some winning teams, so hopefully that experience can translate to the rest of the team. Nicaragua is another team that may not have enough talent to really compete against the three teams we will talk about next, but they will be making their first showing at the World Baseball Classic and I am sure they believe they could stun a heavy hitter. 
Puerto Rico has finished runner up in the last two WBCs, so they are hungry to finally win the title. Newly retired and future Hall of Famer Yadier Molina is managing a team full of stars such as Mets shortstop Fransisco Lindor and Enrique Hernandez. They also added Marcus Stroman who was the 2017 WBC MVP for the U.S. The backend of the bullpen is also set and stone with All Star closer Edwin Diaz and Jorge Lopez. 
Venezuela is looking to return to the top three for the first time since 2009 and they have a well-rounded team to do so. Ranger Suarez of the Phillies and others fill out a decent pitching staff who will have the luxury of throwing to veteran catcher Salvador Perez. The infield is full of key players such as Jose Altuve, Andrés Giménez, and Gleyber Torres, but the outfield is where this team truly shines as Ronald Acuna Jr, David Peralta, and Anthony Santander are excellent hitters for a lineup. Venezuela looks to be one of the more well rounded teams we’ve looked at. 
The Dominican Republic is led by Rodney Linares and he certainly will not have a tough time fielding a lineup. This team is probably the best team to ever be constructed with an all star lineup and pitching staff. Every position has an MLB All Star, if not two, to field the position. Some names are Manny Machado, Juan Soto, Julio Rodriguez, Vladimir Guerroro Jr, and Rafeal Devers. The pitching staff has reigning NL Cy Young winner Sergio Alcantara and playoff hero Cristian Javier among a slew of other notable names. Pool D will be very interesting to see as there are three teams who could easily make a run at the championship. Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico will likely be the teams to move on, but it only takes a key win from Venezuela to get a spot. 
There certainly is a talent disparity between some of the countries, as many of them seem to be absolutely loaded with baseball stars while others are mostly full of amateur stars. Baseball is a funny game though and nothing is guaranteed. We have seen plenty of upsets in the past and it only takes one game to get a team on a roll. No matter what, these teams will compete and play their absolute best. The passion and grit that is shown in the WBC is different from any other baseball I have seen. This will be especially true once we get to the later rounds as the best of the best around the World will be vying to hoist the Championship Trophy.

For the past year, I have been involved with a laboratory that exclusively uses mice to study the brain. This is extremely common in the world of neuroscience — mice and other rodents boast a neural structure that is similar enough to ours and a physiological system that is different enough that we can justify tinkering pretty heavily with their neural function in a laboratory setting. A few months ago, my lab attended a talk by another lab that studied the role of dopamine in the brain.
Now, the state of neuroscience and genetics are such that it is pretty standard to be able to turn on and shut off specific neurons or neurotransmitters at will. That is why it didn’t surprise me that the lab giving the talk on this particular day told us that they’d attempted to completely silence dopamine in the brain in their experimental mice population. The result was something that would stick with me for a long time — whatever the state of a brain without dopamine is, it was so traumatic to the mice that they completely refused to enter the experimental setup again after they’d been exposed to it. It was implied that the mice had literally seen hell.
This is what was on my mind while I was reading the new study from "Neuron" by Berendzen et. al. — “Oxytocin receptor is not required for social attachment in prairie voles” — that used oxytocin deprivation to test whether or not oxytocin is a required neurotransmitter for “love.” Oxytocin is a hormone produced in the hypothalamus, and has been linked to physical behaviors like uterine contractions and lactation as well as social behaviors like trust and the formation of attachments. Basically, whether you’re cuddling with someone or in labor, oxytocin is believed to be a key player in all things reproduction. 
The study in question defined the reproductive cycle by pair bonding, a very quantitative and clear measurement which falls slightly short of our human definition of love as a highly emotional and complex force. Knowing what I do about oxytocin — that’s it's one of the main neurotransmitters that makes us feel good, specifically during the mating or courting process — I instinctively felt really bad for the poor prairie voles who were deprived of oxytocin during the process of the study. Regardless of what neuron, neuron group, or neurotransmitter is toyed with in a neuroscience study, the implication is usually that there will be some kind of change in the behavior of the experimental animal — we like to think that everything going on in our brains has a carefully evolved purpose.
Evidently, though, it didn’t make much difference to them. Voles typically form long-term mating bonds, which are indicative of a more complex social bond than random heterosexual mating between “stranger” animals (this is what makes them such a good choice for this study). The study followed two groups of voles — one normal control group and one group that could not produce oxytocin. From the process of choosing a mating partner to birthing pups to weaning them, the mutant (no oxytocin) voles displayed not a single difference. They continued to prefer mating with a chosen long-term partner over strangers, they birthed normal pups, and they cared for them and raised them as normal. Even gathering wandering pups back to the nest, yet another oxytocin-linked behavior, was still present in the mutant voles. The study concluded that, as pair bonding had proceeded as normal in the mutant voles, oxytocin must not be as critical as we think in mating. 
This, to state it mildly, was a huge shock to all. Prior studies, opposingly, have focused on the utmost importance of oxytocin in all of the behaviors listed above. Additionally, the Berendzen et. al. study mentions that the type of suppression they perform on voles is actually not possible in some other animals. In mice, an oxytocin drought is a death sentence, as mothers become incapable of producing milk for their pups. 
In prairie voles, then, the question becomes: “If oxytocin is not required for successful reproduction, what does it do? And what is responsible for the reproductive behaviors we see?” The study does not answer either of these questions, but it certainly provides food for thought. Berendzen et. al. identify the possibility that there may be other neurotransmitter pathways that have evolved separately in voles to facilitate pair-bonding, which explains why only voles have so far been identified as not really needing oxytocin.
Given how essential these hormones are to the survival of a given species, I expect more studies to surface on this topic. Certainly, it is possible that human evolution has also given rise to a variation on the traditional oxytocin pathway, and it would be incredibly useful to know what those variations are. Because of the complexity of human society as compared with that of voles, “love” is typically considered to be much more nuanced in humans. We develop bonds with people for very specific reasons and in very specific ways. People no longer mate only to reproduce. What, then, are the implications of oxytocin in our world? Our only answer for now: leave it to beaver.

ChatGPT was released in late November, taking the world by storm. While created by OpenAI, the company is now owned by Microsoft following large donations made in 2019 and 2023. It’s widely used, with an estimated 100 million active users in January. In its rise, ChatGPT has also faced significant animosity. China banned the entire system, while companies like Amazon and J.P. Morgan Chase have restricted usage considerably. 
While other companies have attempted to get into competition with OpenAI, there have been some difficulties, especially for Google’s newest product, Bard. Bard has faced several problems in their release, including factual inaccuracies when the program responded to questions. These concerns have cost Alphabet nearly $100 billion in market value, a massive tumble for one of the largest tech companies in the United States. Google has called a “code red” in response to ChatGPT, and it seems Bard will be undergoing additional testing to try to refine it. In addition, China has stepped into the chatbot competition twice, with Baidu’s Ernie building on China’s internet and information base, and Alibaba announcing tests into creating a chatbot in the coming future.
Obviously there’s a lot of value in these chatbots, and the question stands: What use does Microsoft plan on finding from ChatGPT? The project is planned for integration into Microsoft’s Bing search engine and Edge browser, as better information, searches, and completions would streamline their browser’s usability. Considering that Edge is Microsoft’s premier project to regain market share from Google’s Chrome and Mozilla’s Firefox, the improvement may help the new browser. ChatGPT essentially acts as a phrase generator. It reads a huge amount of data, and it’s using that to predict what the answer would be to the question you ask. It’s a very powerful tool, and by combining it with a search engine, ChatGPT could help users get answers to their questions more quickly, especially more complex requests that a simple Google search would not respond to as easily. Because ChatGPT can incorporate information it reads into one answer, it could help Edge become a more powerful, capable search engine for the average user.
Google’s new Bard, on the other hand, is meant to be a better and more powerful version of ChatGPT, with more options for tone and format. Bard may give a user the ability to get a funny answer formatted in letter form, which would give it considerably more use cases than ChatGPT. While Google admits Bard may have inaccuracies, the warning has failed to prevent concerns due to the incorrect responses from questions asked on stage. In a competition where each percent of search engine market share represents billions in revenue, these small benefits could help Google significantly, and not having a competitor to ChatGPT could cost the company a monumental amount.
While Google still has significant AI research and development, including large language model technology that may give an advantage over Microsoft, the partnership with OpenAI gave Microsoft a huge boost and could, if Microsoft capitalizes on it, make the search engine competition competitive again.

Maybe you should go to sleep: a study of sleep and GPA
We've all heard that people should sleep between eight and 10 hours per night, but who listens? Unfortunately, a paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences predicts that students who sleep for less than 6.5 hours each night have markedly lower GPAs. In addition, for each hour of sleep lost, students experience a 0.07 decrease in end-of-term GPA, suggesting that the effects of even one night of lost sleep at the beginning of a semester can hurt a student at the end of the semester.
To quantify the impact of sleep, psychology and neuroscience professor David Cresswell worked with researchers across Carnegie Mellon, University of Pittsburgh, University of Washington, University of Virginia. They tracked the sleep times of 600 first-year students across three universities using Fitbits during the early months of the Winter/Spring term, controlling for factors such as past academic performance, daytime napping, first-generation status, and sometimes total academic course load. They found that none of these had a significant impact on the relationship between sleep and GPA. The researchers believe this shows how harmful the effects of sleep debt are academically and how difficult it is to remedy sleep debt. The researchers hope to identify an optimal time period for when early intervention could be offered to students to improve academic success.
Seed carriers that can bury themselves into soil
In reforestation, agriculture, and nature conservation, seeds often must be spread over a wide area quickly. However, some of these areas can be difficult to access. Instead, farmers and ecologists can use drones to fly into the areas and drop seeds on the ground. However, some seeds cannot simply be put on the ground. They may dry out, be exposed to too much humidity, or be eaten by birds and other wildlife. In these cases, a seed carrier called E-seed developed by researchers from the Morphing Matter Lab, directed by Lining Yao and published in "Nature," can help bury these seeds deeper into the ground. 
These seed carriers are made of wood that is tightly wound around the seed, which then ends in three tails. These wooden tails unwind when exposed to water through rain or humidity; the water cause the tails to spin and drill deeper into the soil. When the rain stops or humidity lowers, the tails dry up, winding closer around the seed again. The researchers designed these carriers in consideration of the material properties, the geometries of the tails and coils, and awn topology. These carriers could be used to help improve soil quality, reduce the chances of landslides, reduce impact of invasive species, and help reforestation efforts. 
Preventing devices from burning out
As electronic devices get smaller, their risks of overheating and burning out increase. Many devices have cooling systems, but there must be an interface between the electronic chip and the cooling system to most efficiently transfer heat away from the chip. To prevent this, researchers in the department of mechanical engineering, led by Sheng Shen and published in "ACS Nano," have created a special interface composed of two thin copper films with a graphene-coated copper nanowire array sandwiched between them. These copper films are Shen's earlier work called "supersolder." By coating the films in graphene, the interface can transport heat more efficiently and has decreased risk of oxidation. The interface material reduces thermal resistance by 90 percent compared to alternatives of the same thickness. 
To reduce air pollution, make electrical systems more efficient
Air pollution from the fossil fuel industry kills 10.2 million people annually. One way of reducing air pollution is to increase the efficiency of the grid system. When an electrical grid is inefficient, it must generate more electricity to compensate, therefore generating more air pollution. A study published in "Energy" led by undergraduate in mechanical engineering Lauren Jenicke, investigated the loss in energy grids by comparing electricity generated and the electricity provided to citizens. They found that in many scenarios, if energy efficiency was improved by anywhere between five and 33 percent, global median emissions could be reduced by up to 40 percent.

HBO’s "The Last of Us," based on the video game of the same name, seems to have taken the world by storm. The show follows Joel Miller (Pedro Pascal) as he tries to survive in a post-pandemic world. This is not COVID-19, but a fungal virus breakout that turns humans into mindless killing machines. After surviving the initial outbreak, Joel is tasked with escorting Ellie Williams (Bella Ramsey) — a young girl believed to be the key to the cure — across America. 
"The Last of Us" has been a critical success for HBO, garnering millions of views each episode. According to Variety, "The Last of Us" had HBO's second most-viewed series premiere in over a decade, behind only the "Game of Thrones" prequel "House of the Dragon." The ratings have also reflected the fans' fervor and love for the show, ranking it as IMDb’s #1 most popular television series (as of 2/24/2023), with an overall score of 9.2/10. 
Incidentally, joining "The Last of Us" on IMDb’s list is AMC’s "The Walking Dead," ranked at #8. Time after time, zombie shows and movies have been met with an overall positive reception, if not from critics, then from viewers. First to introduce the zombie to America’s cultural consciousness was Carnegie Mellon's own George Romero and his zombies in "Night of the Living Dead," which would eventually be followed by an influx of iconic movies such as "I am Legend," "World War Z," "Shaun of the Dead," "Train to Busan," and more. And the grip that "The Walking Dead" had on popular culture during its run was inordinate. 
So my question is: If it is so universally enjoyed, why is the zombie genre seen as so low-brow? Though loved by its fans, it seems as if all the casual viewer sees is the gore and the action. The horror genre in general seems to only be recognized as a cheap, thrill-inducing genre and nothing more. However, I am here to make a case for horror, and more specifically, the zombie genre. 
My thesis is this: zombies highlight humanity by contrasting us with our inhumanity. And at the end of the day, people love to see their humanity thriving and reflected back at them, even in a zombie apocalypse. To tie this article together, think of the third episode of "The Last of Us," which follows two men, Bill and Frank, as they fall in love while fortifying their home base to survive through zombies and raiders. There are barely any zombies in the entire episode, but it still slots in perfectly with the narrative, as it is about human connections. I would also argue that the main plot of the show is not about Ellie and Joel fighting off zombies (as badass as those scenes are), but about their relationship, and about Joel coming to terms with his daughter’s death. 
If you don’t want to take my word for it here, go watch any zombie movie or film, and decide for yourself whether or not what you’re watching is about really about humans fighting zombies, or about humans being humans.

In 2011, he was ready to become the “Irish Justin Bieber.”
During his audition to the X-Factor, 16-year-old Niall Horan said, “I’m ready to fill arenas around the world, sell albums, and become as big as all you guys here in front of me.”
And that he did. Since 2011, Horan joined arguably one of the most successful boy bands in history, sold out hundreds of arenas, and sold tens of millions of albums. 
For the past eight years, the former One Direction member has been building a solo career — quite successfully, I might add. Although he may not have as much name recognition as his former bandmate, Harry Styles, Horan still has a large and continuously growing fanbase. He’s released two solo albums and has a third one on the way.
On Feb. 17, Horan released his latest single, “Heaven.” To me, “Heaven” is not only acoustically mesmerizing, but quite meaningful. 
“Heaven” pulls you within the first few seconds of the song. It’s — you guessed it — quite heavenly. The beginning of the song builds up to the first chorus where Horan sings "God only knows where this could go / And even if our love starts to grow out and control / And you and me go up in flames / Heaven won’t be the same." Every time I hear this chorus, I can’t help but bop along to the beat. I also like to add a little fist pump action when I’m feeling extra energetic. 
Lyrically, the song is also very clever. My personal favorite line in the song is “It’s hard to be a human / So much to put an answer to.” Good one, Niall, very relatable. 
One of things that makes this song especially interesting is what it means to Horan. In many interviews, Horan has explained that, to him, this song is about not conforming to society’s standards and doing things at your own pace. To me, the fact that Horan chose this topic to write a song about really shows his personal growth. He’s no longer that little boy longing to be the Irish Justin Bieber or that teenager in One Direction singing songs like “Temporary Fix” and “Rock Me.” There is also growth evident when comparing Horan’s new single to his first couple solo albums. In his second album, Heartbreak Weather, he sang about the feelings he experienced during a breakup. It’s nice to see Horan’s more optimistic and joyful side through “Heaven.”
In the coming months, Horan has a lot in store. Not only is he performing in ten festivals over the summer, he also has his third studio album coming out on June 9. The album, titled "The Show," will feature ten tracks. 
In a letter to his fans, Horan wrote, “What makes this record incredibly special to me is it’s a reflection of where I am in my life today — as a person, as a musician, and of course as a songwriter.”
Although the contents of the new album will remain a mystery for the months to come, the release of “Heaven” has made one thing certain — Niall really has become the Irish Justin Bieber, and perhaps even a bit more than that.

While none of the artists I listen to have been dropping albums recently, a number of them have been releasing singles or EPs. Here’s a collection of my thoughts on some of the ones I enjoyed recently. 
“Foxglove Through The Clearcut - Acoustic” by Death Cab for Cutie - 8.6/10
When I opened Spotify, I was surprised to see that Death Cab for Cutie had released some acoustic versions of songs from their most recent album, “Asphalt Meadows.” I missed when they released “The Pepper - Acoustic” and “The Plan” back in January, but I didn’t miss this one. I liked “Foxglove Through The Clearcut” when it first came out, and the Acoustic version capitalizes on everything I liked about the original song in a different way. The original felt like a journey while the acoustic version is like a story. Both are definitely worth a listen. 
“Kick in the Teeth” by Hippo Campus - 7.7/10
While I wasn’t the biggest fan of Hippo Campus’ latest album “LP3,” “Kick in the Teeth” has me looking forward to their next EP that will be releasing in April. “Kick in the Teeth” is good, but it goes a little too hard into the Ricky Montgomery vibe for me (not necessarily a bad thing!). It’s a song that has potential, and I can’t wait to see what comes out of their next EP. 
“saturday” by Yot Club - 6.8/10
I haven’t listened to very much Yot Club, but I’m a huge fan of “Fly Out West,” so I wanted to give more of their music a try. I like the style of the song, but the continuous riff isn’t good enough to justify it being in the background of most of the song. I do like the break into the chorus though, it’s refreshing compared to the backing of the rest of the song. The guitar break toward the end also contributes good vibes to the song, but overall, I think some better direction could have been taken with “saturday.”
“West Coast (I’m In Love)” by Smallpools, Jillian Rossi - 9.1/10
I’ve listened to a fair amount of Smallpools, but nothing from Jillian Rossi before. The two pair together nicely in this cover, and I think they provide a great balance for the song. The background and the vocals are both solid, and the ending just goes hard. This song knew what it was, and it went for it: a pairing of voices that is excited to see what’s next. If you like indie music, give this song a shot! (Bonus points for a great cover!)
“Coexist” by Wild Party - 9.0/10
“Coexist” is part of Wild Party’s new EP, “Get Up,” and the entire EP is worth a listen. “Coexist” is a strong start to the EP, and I love the line “That’s why we go together/Like laughter and Pixy Stix.” It’s a song about being the perfect match for someone else no matter what is going on in our lives. “Coexist” is an upbeat song about being happy with someone else, and that makes me happy. 
“Always Selfish” by Flycatcher - 9.3/10
I stumbled across Flycatcher months ago through their song “Games” and have listened to their discography several times since. “Always Selfish” is a great addition to their discography and fits the vibes of their more recent singles. The song is going to be on their newest EP “Stunt” that will be coming out in early April, and it’s one of my most anticipated releases in the near future. “Always Selfish” starts out with a low rhythm line that quickly changes into a more rock-centric feel. The song has a great progression with a good balance of guitar and vocals. I highly recommend “Always Selfish” to anyone with an interest in any degree of rock.

In the world of "Babel," Carnegie Mellon School of Drama’s recent production, childbirth is a matter of perfection. A child’s genes must be analyzed to fit government-imposed behavioral and psychological standards for access to high-paying jobs, comfortable homes, and fulfilling social circles in their lives. This genetic analysis of embryos in utero determines whether doctors designate a baby as “pre-certified,” meaning that the baby is granted access to the upper echelons of society before it is even born. But the pressure to have a pre-certified baby can become cutthroat, causing relationships between couples to falter, or reveal their true strength.
In "Babel," water is a dwindling resource, so much so that it is endangering the survival of humanity. As a response, the government comes up with a solution to this crisis: Before new babies are born, scan their genes so that only the best, smartest, and most agreeable people will come into the world and use water. This is the basis for human “certification.” It essentially aims to create a flawless society with no violence or crime. People who do have flaws — the uncertified — are relegated to the lower classes, forced to work manual labor or service industry jobs and live in the ghettos. The government proposes this motion to the country with a vote, and the vote passes.
As expected, this has many significant effects on human society and behavior. The amount of crime and violence does decrease, as it is mentioned in the play that there are only two mass shootings per year. However, human creativity has all but disappeared. There are no great artists or inventors anymore, because people no longer have unique characteristics that make them flawed. Also, there is a general idea that artists and inventors are “not needed anymore,” because society has supposedly reached its peak performance. In reality, human society has become stagnant and oppressive. 
Daring and edgy, Jacqueline Goldfinger’s "Babel," directed by senior Lucy Murphy, follows two married couples: Renee and Dani, played by junior Sophia Macy and junior Simone Kiyoko De La Torre, and Ann and Jamie, played by juniors Leyla Davis and Christian Engelhardt. Renee and Dani are having fertility issues. After trying to get pregnant for eight years, the baby that Renee is now carrying seems to have a behavioral gene that causes it to fail the pre-certification test. Renee and Dani must now decide whether to keep the baby and risk it being uncertified, or terminate the pregnancy. Meanwhile, Ann and Jamie are also pregnant — with the “perfect” baby, or so they hope.
In this play, the first thing the audience notices about the cast as they move onstage is that they are almost naked, clothed in just their underwear. Seated on three sides of the actors, viewers got up close and personal with the characters almost immediately, seeing them in the most vulnerable and exposed positions — a little shocking and unusual at first but clearly intentional. As the play develops, the audience is granted as much insight into the private lives and confidential moments of the characters through their conversations as is conveyed through the state of dress they are seen in. 
"Babel" is a deeply intimate play about a deeply intimate subject: pregnancy, a topic of discussion typically kept between couples. Here, all the gory details are on display. The strain that pregnancy can put on relationships, often hidden from public view, is exposed as well. 
The play turns out to be as revealing in its words as in its costumes. When characters are not shown in their underwear, the costume design curated by master’s student Izzy Kitch is bright, colorful, and pleasingly futuristic. Every piece seems specifically selected for the character and presents a shiny, sleek, and fun collection of wardrobe perfection. But this perfection does not only apply to clothes. Rather, it emulates the perfection that the society in "Babel" tries to achieve.
Oppression in the "Babel" world is markedly different from oppression in our world. The dividing factor is genetics instead of race or gender. This manifests mostly in job disparity. In "Babel," the jobs that the main characters have are vague and nonspecific, but are imbued with status. A person’s position on the corporate ladder is very important socially. This is interesting because it is such a contrast to the jobs that non-certified people are forced to work: In the real world, these jobs are disproportionately held by under-privileged people. Jobs like public transit drivers and postal workers could be considered the backbone of our functional society, and they are held mostly by people of color. In this aspect, "Babel" is not unlike our world at all. Instead, it is eerily similar, showing how power dynamics stay constant no matter what the power hierarchy is based on.
"Babel’s" title makes biblical reference to the Tower of Babel that humans construct in the Book of Genesis. In the story, all people of Earth were united in communication, speaking the same language, and wished to build a city so high as to be in the realm of God. They wanted “its top in the heavens” so they could access God’s fame and power. Incensed by this direct challenge to the order of the world, God dashes the Tower and disperses the earthlings who defiantly made it. As a further consequence for their rebellious actions, God confuses the language of humans, parabolically creating the many tongues people use today, so that our understanding of each other will be forever lost.
As the humans of Genesis 11 seek to set themselves on a plane with God, so do the people of "Babel" work to take over the role of God in their lives. Chasing perfection for the human race, the characters have taken to “playing God'' in their rules about who can reproduce and what genetic makeup their progeny can have. They now choose who can come into the world and in what social station. They’ve voted to take the decisions usually left to a higher power into their own hands and defy natural creation.
The form of punishment "Babel’s" population may face, resulting from their tampering in the domain of the almighty, is less certain than in Genesis, but there are some indications. By the play’s conclusions, relationships have been severed, friendships and connectivity destroyed. This could be coming as a result of their behavior, but could as likely be the fallout from building a world of ultra-homogeneity, of cut-throat competition for parenting the most perfect child.
In Renee’s case, despite the conspiring influences on her to abort her “uncertifiable” baby, she ultimately decides to “roll the dice” and let nature carry out as it will. “Remember Babel?” she tells her spouse at one point. “We can’t play God.” She never had much faith in the concept of humans meddling in nature’s business, and decides that it is better to see how her child grows up, and how its so-called genetic deformities manifest later in life. Those “negative” traits may turn out to be creative assets. Personality, she realizes, can never be predicted. The unknown is the whole adventure.

Ceci,
I'm really sorry it's been so long since my last letter. I feel like I used to write to you all the time. Back when I was at CMU, I think I wrote a letter to you every weekend, because it was the only way to process the constant train of formative moments that were being forced upon me. Now I'm lucky to write you twice a year. I'm just constantly so busy with everything. Busy with Clair, busy with the baby, with teaching, with my thesis. It's just so much of everything all of the time, and I have no space to clear my head. It feels really awful to say, but planning the funeral has given me the first chance to gather my thoughts in forever.
I would really appreciate it if you could make it. I know you're helping Cynthia with her own family stuff in Japan, and I know that travel to the U.S. is a little iffy at the moment, but it would mean the world to me. Obviously if you can't you can't, but it's been so long. I just want an excuse to see you again. 
Your parents called and told me they're both coming. I think they're just as shocked to have lost two of their friends. And so suddenly, too. The coroner told me that my mom and dad were holding hands in the crosswalk when they got hit, so at least they died together. Or maybe that's just something he tells the bereaved so they don't think too hard about what a car does to a person.
To be honest, I'm not as fucked up as I thought I would be. Given everything that's been going on in the years since I published my post-grad research, you'd think I would be hanging by a thread right now. But it's become easier to take these things in stride, especially with Clair. It's like I have the mental strength of a dozen people when she's with me. I could plan funerals for another ten parents before my wits would start to fry.
You hear that the FDA just approved the telomere-preserving drug? I think the brand name is JuVen. Ironically, the last conversation I had with them was about that. My dad was completely against it, he swore he would never take any anti-aging treatments, but my mom was so in favor. She was always the more progressive of the two. Wouldn't have mattered though, even JuVen can't stop a drunk driver.
I think this pause in my life has been necessary. I've been doing research and taking classes at a frantic speed for — God, I guess since I published that paper with Penco in grad school. So ten years. I don't think I've given myself a moment to rest in a decade. I used to be obsessed with the past, and I always used my music to transport myself back in time. I was listening to the radio last week, and they were playing something off of Faces. Did I ever put you on that album? I was bumping a lot of Mac Miller my freshman and sophomore year. It was jarring, I completely forgot how often I used to lean on my nostalgia music. I think ever since my first paper failed to pan out the way I hoped, I've been trying to make some big breakthrough. It gave me no time to think about the past, and I instead became perpetually anxious about the future. I'm not sure which is worse, to be honest.
After the funeral, I'm going to leave Pittsburgh. Without my parents, there's really nothing tying me to this city anymore. I had been holding off on that job offer from Stanford, but I think that me and Clair are ready to make the move now. It's probably better that we do it before little Roy gets too old, anyways. 
I hope things are going well for you. We have to properly catch up sooner or later.
Love,
Andy

Move aside Rihanna, a new star is here: your ASL interpreter, Justina Miles.
While many of us couldn’t decide if we loved or hated Rihanna’s halftime show (those dancing marshmallows sure were something though), her ASL interpreter stole the show, and promptly went viral on TikTok.
Miles’ set was filled with the perfect amount of energy and confidence, conveying not only Rihanna’s performance but the vibe of her songs. It’s no wonder that her interpretation of Rihanna’s “Rude Boy” remix during the halftime performance gained so many views. 
ASL interpreters are becoming more commonplace at concerts, providing deaf and hard of hearing audiences with a more complete experience. Andrea Marks of Vice explains that due to the wide range of hearing ability among deaf people and increases in technology like hearing aids and cochlear implants, “it's increasingly rare for someone to not be able to hear anything, especially at live concerts, where the speakers can blast sound at over 100 decibels.” 
But being able to hear part of a setlist isn’t the same as having an accessible concert experience, hence the use of ASL interpreters to convey the lyrics and more nuanced instrumental sounds. 
Marks notes that since the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed in 1990, concerts have to provide interpreters upon request. But this requirement has blossomed into a whole new aspect of performance, as interpreters make their own stylistic choices to make a song their own. Marks adds that ASL isn’t just its own language with different grammar and syntax from English, but it is also more idea-based than an exact translation and often relies more on visual elements like facial expressions and use of space. This gives interpreters freedom to translate songs in different ways, sometimes using direct fingerspelling, other times miming actions or using other motions to convey emotions and meanings from the music itself. 
Even for a hearing audience, watching these interpreters perform is an art form itself. John Bell, the lead singer of Widespread Panic, said that “the first time he saw his music performed in ASL was like the first time he heard his music on the radio.” Many clips of ASL interpreters performing at concerts have gone viral, garnering them attention from both deaf and hearing populations. 
So that brings us back to Justina Miles. In a Billboard article by Hannah Dailey, Miles reveals that she received the setlist for the Super Bowl only five days in advance, and focused her interpretation on both conveying the lyrics and moving to the beat, so that viewers could see rather than hear it. 
Beyond Miles’ performance, there are countless others who have risen to internet stardom. At Lollapalooza last year, the interpreter of Cardi B and Megan the Stallion’s "WAP" stole the show with her interpretation of the iconic (and hard to translate) second verse. Amber Gallego, an ASL interpreter with a penchant for rap, went viral for keeping up with Twista, who is among the fastest rappers, when he performed a song not originally in his setlist. And countless other interpreters have received recognition for their performances, especially when interpreting in the genres of rap or heavy metal. 
I, and many people here at The Tartan, are music lovers at our core. Seeing our favorite tracks performed in new ways makes us appreciate them more, and we recognize the hard work these interpreters do to make music accessible for all.

Exciting, original student work is finally happening at Carnegie Mellon — it's just a little hard to find. The School of Drama and Scotch'n'Soda very occasionally stage new plays, but there seems to be no place devoted to fully-fledged productions of original work. Where are we to go on campus to find artistic innovation? Away from it.
Last Saturday night in a multipurpose building in Wilkinsburg, handwritten, misspelled signs guided the way from the entrance down hallways and up an elevator to The New Modern Product Theatre's debut new work, ANYTHING GOOD MAKES ME WANT TO DIE, an adaptation of two short stories from "Homesick for Another World" by author Ottessa Moshfegh (My Year of Rest and Relaxation). The New Modern Product Theatre is a new student-run company on campus, aiming to create all-original works and adaptations. Their first showing was adapted and directed by Pria Dahiya (School of Drama Directing, '24) with dramaturgy and script development by Rowan Dunlop (School of Drama Dramaturgy, '24), and was a no-budget hour-long performance with a cast of five which transformed the white-walled acoustic-tiled conference space into a personal hellscape (or limbo) for two suicidal weirdos.
Featuring trash bags plastered over the windows, a few pieces of furniture, a handful of powerful colored LEDs, and a small CRT television that played cartoons, color tests, game shows, and at one point, an episode of Law & Order, the minimal set helped emphasize the depression in both of the central characters' lives. The first piece, "Malibu," featured Johnny, a knock-kneed, whining man with no money, an overbearing uncle, and a persistent rash. 
Johnny traveled back and forth from his room with a tangled mess of sheets on an air mattress (in one scene, in a visit to a clinic for his many medical problems, a nurse asked him how often he washed his sheets. "All the time," he nervously responded, before turning out to the audience and loudly announcing "I LIED") to his uncle's apartment, his only living family, who lay immobile in a large armchair, where he wore a huge, overinflated fat suit that was covered in old food. Johnny's struggles with the gap between his perception of himself and his reality were realized in the disparity between his well-spoken, confident narration of events, and the depiction of his demeanor when interacting with others. One particularly strong moment featured a recording of his voice describing a self-help book he was planning on writing (with advice like: "if your face is puffy, fill your mouth with coffee grounds!") while Johnny himself had a panic attack writhing around in his dubiously clean sheets. Despite living at rock-bottom in a state of self-delusion, he found his way out after meeting Terri, a woman who shows him the first affection he's ever had, inspiring him with confidence and uniting his vision of reality with reality itself. Although not the most original plot, the conception, execution, and powerful acting compellingly welcomed me in to his life.
The second piece, "The Weirdos," took place in a small apartment complex where an unnamed woman lived with her boyfriend and prayed for one of their deaths — never mind which one. Plagued by the constant cawing of "Egyptian crows," as named by her strange boyfriend, she passed each day sitting by the pool, or standing on the edge of the concrete roof, staring into the distance. This story was characterized less by the stark, block-color lighting of "Malibu," and more by bird chirps, heavy vaporwave synths, and soft New Age-y choral chanting. She drifted passively through each day, speaking only with her boyfriend, an eccentric named Moon Kowalski, and a large crow that hovered in the background. While I felt the acting was still strong, the general tone of apathy and listlessness failed to capture my attention as much as "Malibu" did.
Though these characters might inspire pity or disgust at first, the production captured an element of grace and beauty in both of their lives. After the death of his uncle, Johnny left us with the parting words, "Nothing can be ugly anymore. Not even if I wanted it to be." I believe him.

Prudishness, in its many forms, is an amusing bear to poke. "South Park" creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker know this well, and for the past two decades they have successfully used "South Park" as a way to satirize the prudish social world we occupy. Historically, controversy and "South Park" have gone hand-in-hand. Even as of a few days ago, "South Park" is once again in legal dispute, this time for ragging socialite couple Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
Frankly, it is quite remarkable how much Stone and Parker have managed to get away with throughout the years, and their first film, “South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut,” is no exception. However, this is not to say that what they do is bad. It is our society, built on the predicate of maximizing free speech, which has allowed for "South Park" to become so mainstream. The show has championed free speech by pushing the boundary on what can be shown as entertainment media since its inception, and consequently, their episodes often stand as political statements rather than mere juvenile absurdity. Their political statements are not loyal to any particular party or creed, but rather aim to represent voice of the public against those who run the world. Often cynical, they point out that it's not their jokes that are absurd, but rather the people and things at which the jokes are aimed. 
Released in the summer of 1999 at the height of the Y2K scare, the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, and so much more, “Bigger, Longer, & Uncut” stands as a referendum on an adult society that sees its youth as out of control due to the content that they view. Rather than correcting their parenting skills, they attack media which was never designed for children in the first place. It is very obvious that the film wishes to highlight those who seek to cancel “South Park” and show how very wrong they are. 
The beginning of the film has the main boys sneak into an R-rated picture and then mimic the things that they see on-screen, commenting on a prevalent fear in our society. For the longest time, parents have feared that the media their children see will encourage unruly behavior. And to be fair, total unrestricted access to the internet is probably not the greatest thing for a child. To address the shockingly vulgar vocabulary of their children, the parents of our protagonists form a coalition against the media, their own children, and everyone other than themselves. 
The message of the picture is that parents should take responsibility for the behavior of their children instead of scapegoating television networks or programs, like “South Park.” In reality, one could argue it's their own fault that their children have access to this type of media in the first place.
Of course, this bleeds into a bigger issue that parents face today: the rapid growth of technology has made the childhoods of adjacent generations different beyond the point of comparison. Today, adults cannot relate to the childhoods of their own children or grandparents has led to an inability to understand, and thereby inability to control, what information their children consume.
In 1999, before everyone — including children — had a magic light box capable of answering any query without hesitance (no matter how vulgar it may be) parents had much less to worry about. Frankly, “South Park” is the least of parents’ worries today, but similar attitudes toward children's exposure to media still prevail.
“Bigger, Longer, & Uncut” also took a stand against favoritism within Hollywood, specifically the Motion Picture Association of America, the organization responsible for administering audience ratings on the films. Their method of judgment on films added to the battle that was ongoing between parents and media programs.
Statistically, more films get severe ratings due to profanity than violence, and it is this superficial “cleansing of language in society” which Parker and Stone wished to press Hollywood on. Upon original review of the film, the MPAA gave the film a NC-17 rating, which was unacceptable to Paramount Pictures. The MPAA’s reasoning was the film’s profanity, and upon lessening the amount of swearing to 399 swear words, they would secure an R-rating, with the adjudication that one more swear word and they would get a NC-17. This type of absurdity is what "South Park" aimed to satirize in the first place.

The '90s cartoon revival phenomenon has touched many a property these past few years — from "Ducktales" to "Tiny Toons," reboots have been a popular method to milk the people’s need for nostalgia in media. "Animaniacs," an animated variety show produced by Steven Spielberg, was not immune to the reboot treatment — but it works for them 'cause it's cool! (or so they say). But is it really? Now that the series has reached its untimely end, I'll catch you up on what you missed till that point, and then I'll give my personal verdict.
SEASON 1
Season 1 of the "Animaniacs" reboot had high hopes and gusto to match, but it fell flatter than a villain hit by a giant mallet. It wasn’t terrible — save for a few gross-out moments that really didn’t add anything to the show other than the modern demand for gross out shots — but it did seem lacking. The Warner siblings seemed to be caricatures of their past selves. Yakko yaks (and sings), yeah, but what else does he do? Wakko, the self proclaimed “eating stuff guy,” does little more than stuff his face full of anything he can get his hands on. And Dot? Well, she’s still cute, but has more bite and sass than cuteness, making her feel unbalanced. The mice are closer in personality to their '90s selves, but Brain seems to lean more towards his megalomaniacal side in the reboot. The characters do change slightly over the course of the three seasons in the reboot, which ultimately does end up working out.
But something’s missing from this menagerie of madness. Where are the Goodfeathers? Slappy Squirrel? Rita and Runt? Simply put, they didn’t make the cut. The new series focuses heavily on the Warner siblings and the mice, but neglected to make Animaniacs what Animaniacs was — a variety show. There are other segments, new ones, but they aren’t nearly as memorable and there aren’t nearly as many. Some have their charm, such as Starbox and Cindy, but otherwise, not many would bat an eye at them.
Season one showed the reboot had potential, but would season two prove it's up to snuff?
SEASON 2
Fortunately for the fans, Season 2 was much better than the first. The characters felt much more fleshed out, with personalities closer to their originals. The writing is also sharper. One example is a parody of “Duck Amuck” (“Yakko Amakko”) that has Yakko invoke his cartooney wrath on a new “friend,” an animator who thought it would be a good idea to mess with him. It’s a pretty cool segment, and incorporates some modernity into the old “cartoon getting drawn by animator” gag, making you wonder if this is what Duck Amuck might look like today. 
The Warner sibs feel a lot more rounded out, and animation styles are played with more too. The strongest segment is clearly still the mice’s, with their friendship (relationship? As Pinky says of their relationship status, it's complicated) evolving. This season was promising, and made us wait eagerly for the arrival of Season 3.
SEASON 3
While the variety show overall lacks major continuity, Season 3 picks up right where it left off. The new CEO, Nora, has been demoted to security guard because of her frustration with Ralph (the previous security guard) becoming head of Warner Brothers through lineage (don’t think about it too much). The Warner sibs are locked in the water tower once again. This time, they’re stuck, as Nora is a much more competent guard than Ralph would ever be. The siblings worry for their future, so they come up with a plan to get things back to normal. 
We then transition to another segment of this variety show. This time, the stars are two genetically altered lab mice. 
Pinky and the Brain has arguably been the strongest segment on the Animaniacs reboot, and the most popular. We start off the season in Pinky’s perspective through a how-to video livestream. In it he details “how to friendship,” using Brain as the subject of his video. Of course, Brain is hard at work preparing a ridiculously elaborate plan to take over the world — and of course, in attempt to try to get the megalomaniacal mouse to smile, Pinky accidentally ruins the plan. 
The episode ends with the end of part one, where we see what Ralph as CEO of Warner Brothers looks like. Let’s just say he doesn’t have much variety in movie ideas. Eventually he resigns from his position as CEO and returns to being a security guard, to the siblings’ relief, and all goes back to its usual zaniness.
As the season progresses, we get several parodies. One tries to comment on child influencers (such as JoJo Siwa), others are parodies of well known films. For example, the Pinky and the Brain segments “Mad Mouse: Furry Road” and “Groundmouse Day” (…I’ll let you guess what those are parodying) among many, many other references and callbacks. This sort of balances out the meta humor they’ve used in the past to say “WE’RE NOT LIKE OTHER REBOOTS!!”, and while I find the excessive references to be a tad better than the excessive meta humor, I personally wish we could’ve gotten a better balance of them both. 
They also did a holiday episode, which consisted of three segments: “How The Brain Thieved Christmas,” “Santamaniacs,” and “How The Brain Thieved Christmas: Part 2.” This special being heavy with the use of Pinky and the Brain was likely in reference to the special “A Pinky and the Brain Christmas” from the "Pinky and the Brain" spinoff from the '90s, which was such a well made episode all around it won a Primetime Emmy Award in 1996. They do reference it in the reboot, I will say. The plot of the reboot segment is surprisingly similar to the Christmas special from the '90s, save for a twist at the end. I liked the episode overall, but found the Pinky and the Brain segment particularly sweet.
They even brought back a beloved character from the original (!!) … for only a minute. I won’t say who, but the minute the character appeared on screen just their mere presence made me smile, it had been such a long time and their humor was still the same. Suffice to say, this season, while strong in its characterizations overall (the Warner sibs feel much more like the Warner sibs), I found the excessive use of parody a bit much. It seemed as if they leaned more into that this season than they did last, which I feel comes from the fact that their parodies were directly referenced as a punchline rather than relying on viewer’s knowledge. Some references felt shoehorned in, which made me break from the moment a bit, but otherwise, they handled it as best they could. 
Unfortunately, the series was not renewed for a fourth season, and instead of the usual 13-episode order, they only got 10 for season three. This meant significant plotholes in continuity (of the little they had) and much unfinished chaos for the Warner sibs to cause. 
The mice’s plotline with a new villain, Julia, as well as their own relationship status had to be put to a halt. Storyboard artist Lisa Vandenberg (aka “geezerflakes” online) has posted storyboards both used and unused that they made, portraying the progression of Pinky and Brain’s relationship; Brain’s refusal to admit his feelings of companionship to Pinky had been portrayed before, mostly LGBTQ-coded in some way. These storyboards made that more overt — the show seemed to already be leaning towards developing the mice’s relationship in this way, but it might have been shown more in future seasons, which we know will never happen now. We did get to see a lot of this played out in “All’s Fair in Love and Door,” as well as other instances during the show’s run, but unfortunately, we’ll never see how it turns out for them. 
I feel as though this season would’ve faired even better than it currently does now if only there had been the promise of another season — that way there would be a chance for loose ends to be tied. Even season 2 felt more complete in that sense than season 3; the second season seemed to have been written with an immediate end in mind, and while the characters’ personalities might not have reached their endpoint, they were alluded to in a way that makes the viewer wish for more, but ultimately must remain content about. Season 3 was much more ambitious on that end, so when it ended, it did so abruptly, and quite literally went out with a bang. It felt incomplete, aggravatingly so. 
In summary, the reboot of "Animaniacs" was fun and nostalgic. It wasn’t particularly revolutionary, and some of the jokes felt forced at times; by no means was it perfect. But I had a good time watching it, and it was what drew me into the "Animaniacs" franchise as a whole, so I consider that a massive win. If you’re a fan of animation at all, I’d say to give it a watch. It might not be everyone’s cup of tea, but hey, they’re not the ones writing this review — and those are the facts.

President Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine this week, arriving in Kyiv amid air raid sirens and lockdowns as the city continues to face frequent bombardment from Russian artillery. He traveled in secret, and his journey is the first an American president has taken to a warzone in which the U.S. did not have an active military presence, and so did not control the skies. While it was risky, there is precedent for American presidents going to war zones, including George Bush in 2003. Early Sunday, the president boarded a Boeing 757 with several journalists and a security detail. First, the plane flew to Ramstein Air Base in Germany, the headquarters for the U.S. Air Forces Europe – Air Forces Africa. Ramstein is a crucial part of American and European defense initiatives on the continent, and often used by the United States when transporting or moving important items into Europe. While the FSB and the Russian government were notified through diplomatic channels, the journey was kept under wraps by the United States. 
The conflict reached its one year anniversary on Feb. 24. The U.S. has been one of Ukraine’s staunchest allies during its time, pledging and donating huge amounts of stockpiled munitions, including American stockpiles of Soviet technology often used to operate in the middle east. As the war has worsened, with both sides stalling due to weather conditions, the influx of weaponry has been essential to any further combat. Biden’s goal was to reiterate American support for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, with promises of new arms deals and weaponry. Biden was met with applause and a warm welcome by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who called the visit historic, timely, and brave.
Biden’s visit comes at a key time for Ukraine, with the high use of artillery and shelling putting a drain both on the military materiel as well as production. 
Artillery shells, like bullets, warp and disfigure weapons bit by bit as more are used. The M777 Howitzer, which Canada sent to Ukraine, an artillery piece built by BAE systems and utilized by a number of nations — including the U.S. and the U.K. — is rated for 2,500 rounds prior to barrel replacement. Accuracy decreases without a barrel replacement, with repeated wear and tear essentially reducing the power of big guns. The M777 can be upgraded to be accurate within 30 meters, but with excessive use, the weaponry would lose the ability to fire with any meaningful accuracy.
The Russians have currently tied themselves up in two major locations: Bakhmut, a conflict that has been raging for nearly half a year, and now Vuhledar. Much like how Bakhmut stalled out, Vuhledar also faces the possibility of failure, with the reporting on the ground from Oryx, a group which catalogs all visually confirmed losses (losses of tanks, armored cars, etc. for which photographic evidence occurs), stating that the Russians have lost over a hundred vehicles in the advance. The Vuhledar offensive has been disastrous for the Russian army, with entrenched Ukrainian fighters reporting that the Russians are employing tactics reminiscent of the early rush to Kyiv. According to Ukrainian officials, Russia lost a brigade at Vuhledar, with an estimation of just under 5,000 killed, captured, or wounded. On top of that, these losses appear to be part of Russia’s 155th Guard Naval Infantry, an elite unit whose numbers will be difficult to replace. This is a pattern in the Ukraine conflict, as elite, well-trained units take heavy damage, forcing the Russians to rely on units with significantly less combat training. 
Following the West’s estimations, Russia isn’t currently capable of breaking through at Vuhledar, or any other point on the front. Wagner Group, a Russian private military company, has currently been forced to recruit directly from prison, with penal levees becoming a large part of the group’s strengths. According to Ukrainian officials, Russia may move to conscript full-time college students in the coming months, which would lead to a new source of Russian manpower, one that would exhaust Russia’s already fleeing intellectual community. While there was fear that the current offensives in Vuhledar and Bakhmut would lead to breakthroughs, the Russian military has failed in making these fears a reality. 
As the war continues, Ukraine continues to hold its ground and has been able to rely on advanced weaponry to keep Russians stalled.

Turkey was hit with more earthquakes this week, as the country recovers from the earthquake that hit on Feb. 6. Early last week, the quakes that shook the country had magnitudes of 6.4 and 5.8, which are both smaller than the intial quake. 
The Feb. 6 earthquake currently has a death toll of about 45,000, with considerable infrastructure cost across Turkey and Syria, affecting, according to some reports, almost 30 million people. The situation has continued to deteriorate for Turkey and Syria, as the aftereffects of these quakes are making the rescue more difficult, damaging infrastructure, and further weakening buildings that had survived prior devastation.
The new quake rocked Antakya in the Hatay province of Turkey, and, according to Turkey’s health minister, a total of 294 were injured, with 18 people being injured seriously. The death toll — around thirteen as of the writing of this article — is low due to the evacuations from the first earthquake. The impacted regions were mostly empty, and while the infrastructure has been hit hard, not many people are left in the region. According to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, 1.6 million people are in temporary housing. However, several people were retrieving their things from the buildings in Antakya, and some were trapped in collapsed from the second quakes. 
With the ongoing civil war in Syria, this second quake is going to only further disrupt any humanitarian aid sent to the country. Consistent conflict, as well as massive displacement from natural disasters, will continue to stress the resources the country has. In some places, civilians were jumping out of buildings during the quakes. Rescues are still occurring.
The area is predicted to get several more magnitude five earthquakes over the next year, and these continuing aftershocks are only going to make rescue and rebuilding processes harder. Erdogan has promised a swift rebuild, with this crisis being weaponized by both coalitions to win the coming elections.
The U.S. has promised $100 million to help Turkey in the coming months.

As of Feb. 20, the Pittsburgh Waterfront will be imposing a new curfew on individuals under 21 years of age. According to their policy document, this change aims to "deter disruptive activity" and promote a "family friendly environment." 
The Waterfront is a large open air shopping mall located on the outskirts of Pittsburgh proper, with its property split between the boroughs of Homestead, West Homestead, and Munhall. The shopping center is managed by BIG Shopping USA, a subsidiary of a multinational corporation that manages shopping large retail centers. BIG USA is headquartered in Arizona and lists the Waterfront as one of the five locations across the country that they operate. Located on the site of the former Homestead Steel Works, this massive shopping center opened in 1999 and currently lists 84 businesses on their directory.
According to the new policy, individuals under the age of 18 will not be allowed in the mall after 6 p.m. unless accompanied by an adult over 21; additionally, individuals under the age of 21 will not be allowed at the mall after midnight. The policy explains that those found in violation of this policy will be asked to leave and may find themselves banned from the Waterfront. Furthermore, those who refuse to leave may be charged with trespassing. It also appears that under the new policy, mall security and law enforcement reserve the right to ask for ID from anybody who appears to be under the age of 18, explaining, "proof of age will be required if age cannot easily be determined." 
According to Emily Wittmer, general manager and director of marketing for The Waterfront, this new policy aims to address large groups of unattended minors causing trouble in public spaces. "We do get large groups, and then there is concern that things may happen when those large groups come through, especially without parental guidance,” Wittmer said in an interview with Pittsburgh's Action News 4. 
This comes shortly after Mayor Gainey announced plans to increase police presence in Downtown Pittsburgh. Local business owners raised concerns that a rise in street violence has been driving away business, pointing to two shootings that occurred this past January. In response, the City of Pittsburgh began supplementing their patrols of Downtown with Allegheny County police officers. Similar concerns were raised by business owners on the South Side, who recently used their time in front of state legislators to demand greater police presence in the bar-heavy neighborhood around E. Carson Street. They allege that unruly crowds of people, predominantly underage teenagers, have been disrupting the peace and causing violence near their businesses. 
Other cities face similar issues. In December, a violent altercation claimed the lives of two children near Atlantic Station, a mall in Atlanta of similar size to The Waterfront. This, followed by a later incident in which a large crowd of unattended children caused significant disorder at the mall, prompted a change in the mall's youth policy, which now includes a 3 p.m. curfew for unattended children and a 9 p.m. curfew for those under 21. This is in addition to an 8 p.m. curfew for children under 16, which is in effect for the entirety of Fulton County.
This January, nearly 7.7 million dollars in state funding was secured from the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency to support efforts to decrease youth violence in Allegheny County. The Waterfront curfew demonstrates an increased desire to address youth crime through law enforcement, as business owners throughout the city raise continue to raise concerns over this issue.

Mayor Ed Gainey met with students on Feb. 23 in an open town hall hosted by CMU Senate and Graduate Student Assembly. Organizers took questions for Mayor Gainey from the students gathered, expressing their comments and concerns for the city.
Gainey assumed the mayoralty in January 2022, beating out the Democratic incumbent in the primaries and defeating the Republican candidate with 71 percent of the popular vote. He is the first Black person to be voted into the position. His administration has centered its efforts on promoting economic and social justice, and building a city with equity and inclusivity for all.
Below are edited selections from last week’s hour-long conversation: students’ questions, and Mayor Gainey’s remarks.
What are your top priorities as Mayor, especially as it relates to students here at Carnegie Mellon?
I want this to be the safest, most welcoming, and thriving city in America. Now, I didn't say it because I thought it was going to be easy. We're coming out of a pandemic, which has changed the course of our lives and had an impact on everybody. More struggling with mental health, more unhoused, more drug usage, more violence. But I tell people I want to make this the safest city because I believe we can. I've had to deal with a lot in trying to make that a reality.
In my first 48 hours after I got elected, we had our first snowstorm, and found out we had no money in the Department of Public Works, our trucks were 10 to 15 years old, and we had 21 percent personnel not at work. But I wanted to let the workers know that I was with them. So, I jumped in the snow truck, and I went out with them. Because I wanted them to know that I don't lead from the back, I lead from the front. I believe that a boss will tell you what to do but won't go with you. A leader will go first and ask permission for you to follow. And I think that's the difference when we talk about leadership styles.
I grew up in a city that was siloed and segregated. I don't want that society. We have to celebrate culture, that's the American way. Because I have the most diverse staff that was ever in the mayor's office — the most diverse administration ever, and it means we can thrive. At the end of the day, if you're not diverse, you're not prepared.
Do you know if the massive chemical spill in East Palestine will at all affect the residents of Pittsburgh, whether the water or the air?
We’re not sure yet. We're trying to gather mayors from all around southwest Pennsylvania to talk about it. I think this is an opportunity for us to really deal with Norfolk Southern, which has been a thorn in all of our sides for a long time. They barely take responsibility for anything if you want to be honest. I'm not sure what five to six months looks like. What I can tell you now, is that state officials say that it doesn't. That's all I know.
You mentioned that you want to create Pittsburgh as a city for all. How would you fit education into that?
I think education is very important. And so that's why I made it a focal point of mine to create a relationship with Pittsburgh Public Schools, because the last administration and the last superintendent did not have a relationship. To improve the quality of education from a city perspective, for one we created a youth Civic Leadership Academy, alongside PPS, Partner4Work, and the Community College of Allegheny County, so high school kids can get paid a stipend while learning and earning college credits.
Growing up I never knew who the mayor was. They never came to my neighborhood. What I want kids to know and understand is the function of not only the mayor but civic government. We’re also creating a Youth Ambassador Program to connect kids with higher learning and give them a voice to talk about what the world looks like to them.
You mentioned Carnegie Mellon as a potential partner in your last answer. I'm wondering more generally what your administration is looking for Carnegie Mellon or Pitt to do, if they can do more for the city of Pittsburgh?
We want to make sure that our infrastructure is good. Our nonprofits own a lot of infrastructure in this city. And we can't grow if we're not together. We can't grow if we're not working to make the city the best place it can be. If our roads, public safety, parks, ecosystem are not good, it’s not good for your university. What we're asking for is cooperation. It’s only together can we make this the best city that we want it to be.
If people don't see their culture reflected in our city, they're not staying. We have a lot of college kids that come in and go to college, but they don't stay. We have a lot of businesspeople who come in and get educated. And they leave because they don't see their culture reflected from our city. We have to change that. Well, that doesn't just come from the city government. We all must play our part.
There’s a saying that first impressions last. Pittsburgh International Airport is the first image many students see when arriving in the city. What is the current plan for expansion of the airport and the timeline for the new terminal?
I'll share something with you. The city doesn't control the airport. That's a county function. I don't even have a seat on the Airport Authority Board. The city has no jurisdiction over the airport authority at all. I don't know all the plans because we're not at the table. The city doesn't control what used to be called Port Authority, or Health and Human Services. It's all controlled by the county.
Now, let me tell you what I'd like to see. I think that in order for a city to be successful, you have to have a world-class airport. But if we build a world-class airport without transportation, getting people from the airport to Oakland, without sitting in traffic for an hour and a half ... then what good is a world-class airport, if it doesn't transport people? If we don't find a way to transport people better, then we'll just have a world-class airport with status-quo transportation.
That's a good question because a lot of people think the city controls all that. But we don't.
As a student, I walk around a lot and sidewalks are important to me. Some sidewalks will be unsalted for long periods of time and get incredibly icy. In some areas, sidewalks are broken or completely absent. Is there a plan to improve them?
Here's the tricky part, right? The city doesn't own all the sidewalks, some of it is privately owned because they're attached to a house. We can't go on private property and salt or fix that sidewalk. The ones that we own, we're doing, starting in Arlington and Homewood with a program connecting Safe Routes to School, the two areas with the most kids walking to school.
The program that we will expand on offers to pay private homeowners a certain percentage of the cost to fix the sidewalk, who may not have the money themselves. We haven't done this yet; we're tinkering with it to make sure it's correct. If private owners are willing to do that, then that will give us permission to go on their sidewalk and fix it. But because we have not invested in our sandbox in a long time, we're lightyears behind, to be honest. It’ll take some years to catch up.
A lot of Carnegie Mellon students who don't live on campus live in South Oakland and many of the landlords there are notoriously terrible. Do you have any plans to crack down on “slumlords” operating across Pittsburgh?
So let me be honest, that was not on our list, with everything going on in the city. That's a great question that I have to take back. We did the rental registry, which was supposed to address that right there, that if you don't have quality housing, it's problematic, and the city will act. We’re in court with that right now. But that was our answer to, not only in South Oakland, but throughout the city, make landlords responsible. I agree, in many areas, it's been a problem. We will continue to fight it. But they will fight back, that's what makes it challenging. When we get the rental registry complete, it won't be immediately —there's no microwave meals in change. But you will definitely see a difference.
Bridges are very important to Pittsburgh. You have a seat on the Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission (SPC), which helps with getting state and federal funds to projects like renovating our bridges in Pittsburgh, essential for revitalizing our infrastructure. From my understanding, in the past several months, you have not been at some of those meetings. There hasn't been a representative from your office at those meetings.
We send a representative every month. The article was about me not being there. I can't be at every meeting, but I have a Director of Economic Development who is at every meeting. We took the SPC to Harrisburg last year, lobbying for our fair share, because Philadelphia was getting more than theirs. And we’ll be back again. The article that you’re referencing was about, to be frank, the fact that I support the workers striking against the Post-Gazette. And I won't waver on it. If you want to put it out there that I don't attend the SPC meetings, I can't say you're incorrect. But it's not the truth. My office is there every month.
I believe in people's right to unionize. And I believe that in today's times, with corporations and everybody else making billions of dollars, that there's a right to be able to pay your workers. You can't keep asking for more and say that your pay is status quo. Status-quo doesn't grow. We've always been a union town. And I think that you see more people starting to stand up and fight for their rights, and I'm for that.
In life, you have to learn how to fall in love with adversity, stay away from controversy. Because adversity will build you. I have nothing but respect for the Post-Gazette. They can say what they want. The reality is my team was there and we will continue to be there. What they didn't say is we must have done something right. They built the bridge quicker than it's ever been built before.
For the long-term residents of Pittsburgh, do you think there’s an issue with increased rents? And if so, how would you address that? Also, do you think it’s important to improve the homeownership rates in the city?
Yes, and yes. Inclusionary zoning allows us to embed inside a project a certain amount of affordability so we can keep the development stable. I believe that to break the chains of poverty, you have to have affordable housing units, to show children something new than what they're used to seeing every single day. I believe that we have to increase the rate of homeownership. We're looking for immediate funding to help us begin our expansion of affordable units.
We've already sent a message to the development community that if you don't have affordability in your housing, we don't do business. Thanks to negotiations with developers, namely Oakland Crossings [a new development plan] close to here, we were able to ensure deep affordability with Section Eight vouchers to get more of a diverse audience in that housing complex.
Those are the things we're doing to move this housing market forward. It’s not that I'm against market rate, but market rate doesn't grow cities. We've lost population as the market rate has grown. We're a second-class city, we’re only 301,000. If we lose too much population, we'll drop to a third-class city [classification], which would hurt us from a funding standpoint of federal and state money. And we can't afford that.
Pittsburgh is known for being quite gentrified. What are your thoughts on how gentrification is impacting the city, and what is being done about it?
I've seen it firsthand. We lost 7,000 people to gentrification, out of the city. It's unhealthy, it hurts the school district and the whole ecosystem. I came in laser-focused, and I've told developers that if you don't have affordability in your housing project, don't come see me. We have to stabilize our communities, our neighborhoods. A lot of the people that were gentrified went out to areas where they have poor transportation, creating islands of poverty, instead of empowerment centers, what housing can be.
You know, out of 15 major metropolitan cities, Pittsburgh's the only city that doesn't have a Black, Latino, or Asian middle-class neighborhood. That's amazing in 2023. But it gives us the ability to advocate for affordability. Because to grow, you have to have affordability. And we will continue to do that until we stabilize the city.
From what you’ve said today, it seems “diversity” is the key word. You want people coming here to stay, not just for school. As mayor, how do you see your administration making Pittsburgh more attractive, competing with bigger cities in the area?
It's our history. We’ve always been a connector between the Midwest and the East Coast. Most cities can't say that. Technology has grown here, for a reason. We’re close to big cities, New York, Chicago, but don’t have the high real estate those areas have. Our parks are beautiful, and our top-tier universities make us attractive. We’re beginning to see diversity in our business climate. We're seeing more enthusiastic youth who just want to see their culture embraced here. For me, as mayor, I see more of an upside to that challenge than a downside.
But what I tell young people is, what this city will look like in 20 years, you know better than me. Your eyes will dictate what this city is really going to be. My generation has to execute the plan to build for a better tomorrow for the youth to advance the way they see fit.
In here, all of you are future leaders, whether you believe it or not, because when I was in your seat, I didn't believe it. But I get it now. Your eyes are deeper than mine. You see what you want the world to be. I got to execute the plan that I saw twenty years ago when I was in your seat. When I'm ready to pass that baton, 15 years from now, you should be ready to lead.

The Waterfront is imposing a curfew now, which is a silly and bad rule I don't like. I wrote a news piece about it this week, so if you want to hear the details go read that (I'm not trying to rewrite it, go flip to A1 and educate yourself.) The short of it is that if you're under 18, no Waterfront after 6 p.m., and if you're under 21, no Waterfront after midnight. That's right underclassmen, we can't just point and laugh at the unlucky Pittsburgh high schoolers who will now be escorted out of the Dave & Busters as soon as the sun sets. If you're planning on seeing a late night movie at the AMC, you better have a damn good fake or you might get into hot water with the Homestead boys in blue. (Author's note: The Tartan does not condone using fake identification. But if you do happen to have one, for the love of God, don't show it to a cop.)
The natural question to ask is, why right now? What's been happening recently with youth at the Waterfront that we have to impose such a strict curfew? None of the articles reporting on it indicate any rampant spike in criminal activity, and their own policy document does little more than allude to a desire to "deter disruptive activity." So we have to make inferences.
I'm reminded of a supposed trend seen by bar owners on the South Side. Earlier this month, a number of business owners on the South Side used an opportunity to speak in front of state legislators to demand that police be "allowed to do their jobs." The author quotes James Hoffman, part owner of Mario's South Side Saloon (owned by the same people who run the Mario's in Oakland and Shadyside). James alleges that a recent drop in their business is caused by "crowds of unruly people, mostly underaged teenagers" who loiter, drink on the street, disrupt the peace, and get into violent altercations.
Furthermore, Mayor Gainey recently announced that Allegheny County Police will be supplementing city cops in patrolling Downtown Pittsburgh, over concerns of increasing crime and street violence. But is crime really increasing? In the article I linked earlier, after quoting the owner of Mario's, they quote Acting Deputy Chief Linda Rosato-Barone. According to her, "violent crime has actually been decreasing in the South Side Flats neighborhood."
I have similar thoughts on this curfew as I do regarding Mayor Gainey's initiative to increase the number of cops Downtown. I think one should be wary of any increase in police action done to protect business interests. Because, when police are primarily concerned with protecting property and businesses, they might not be incentivized to act in the best interests of the people living in a community. 
I also want to talk about the consequences of this curfew, or in other words, won't somebody please think of the children? In sociology, there is a concept called the "third place," referring to a public area where people in a neighborhood can gather and form relationships. For college students, the university center (or student union, as lesser institutions often call it) might be the closest thing you ever have (or ever will) experience that resembles a third place. The term comes from the idea that home is the "first" place and work is the "second" place, but that people still need an additional place to relax and socialize. In European cities this is often a local pub or coffee shop. But unfortunately for Americans, our drinking culture dictates that bars are solely places that adults go to get drunk, and coffee shops are often franchises that want to maximize their sale of expensive drinks. In fact, McDonalds and similar fast-food restaurants pretty frequently serve the function of a third place, which is definitely some sort of powerful metaphor about community prevailing in the face of consumerist capitalism that I'm going to leave as an exercise for the reader. 
Anyways, my point in bringing up this idea is to point out that most American cities don't really have anything that approaches this. As many who grew up in America (particularly the suburbs) will know, sometimes the only way to spend time as a teenager is to drive to various parking lots in your city and commit acts of criminal mischief and/or substance abuse. Most of our cities are designed for the car and lack public spaces for kids to spend their time, so as a child you're essentially on house arrest until you (or one of your friends) turns 16 and gets a driver's license. If I was a teenager in Pittsburgh, I could imagine that loitering in the Target and Dick's followed by some Burgatory would be the ideal way to spend an evening. I spent many evenings of my youth similarly at various strip malls in Westchester, New York, and I can imagine how crushed I would have been if the Arcadian Shopping Center imposed any sort of curfew. 
But let's now address the concerns of these business owners — youth crime and delinquency is certainly a complicated problem, but I think the city is trying to apply a too simple solution. I see this curfew essentially in the same vein as Mayor Gainey's Downtown police surge and the desire of South Side bar owners to have more cops on the street. Several articles on the subject of Downtown crime brought up a shooting this January, the perpetrator of which was an 18-year-old boy. 
Addressing youth crime requires a tremendous amount of time and investment into these children, something our culture and governments seem extremely averse to trying. It's known that juvenile incarceration is extremely counterproductive. The carceral system isn't actually designed to help families in need, it's designed to keep problematic children off the street for as cheaply as possible. So I don't particularly believe that more cops are going to actually address youth delinquency, it's just an easy band-aid to protect business interests and give the impression of solving the problem. 
The issue is also complicated because people's livelihoods do depend on businesses doing well — it would be dishonest to frame the interests of businesses as being entirely separate from the interests of the broader community.  Furthermore, I want to concede that it's easy for me to talk about crime statistics because for me, these things are just numbers. I'm not a restaurant owner dealing with violence on my sidewalk, and I'm not a parent trying to deal with the behavior of a delinquent child. However, I think a strict curfew isn't the solution either. That solution only makes sense from a worldview where more punishment and more cops is our first answer to complicated issues. 
But the greatest issue, I believe, is the fact that the curfew will increase the number of encounters between children and law enforcement, every one of which is an opportunity for police violence to occur. 
Our culture has a very punitive mindset with regards to crime, and our first reaction to violence and disorder is to increase police activity. But these sorts of solutions overlook the tremendous amount of other factors that incentivize crime (and how we can use things that aren't police to disincentivize crime). It's also not impossible to imagine that by criminalizing being a child in public after 6 p.m., you're only going to further incentivize those who are already out to engage in more delinquent activity. I think the curfew is perhaps a short-term solution to appease business owners, but ultimately isn't going to serve the city in the way its proponents hope.

In recent years, the book community has been revitalized by social media. From BookTokers to Bookstagramers: If there’s a platform, someone somewhere is talking about books. The pairing of books and social media sometimes seems contradictory, but with the recent popularity of book content on TikTok, the online book community is finding an eager audience. This sudden influx of new readers, plus the ease of finding and recommending books to lots of people has both benefits and drawbacks, which has shaped the reading community in some unique ways. 
For a long time, books have been avenues of community. In today’s world these communities have transitioned onto the most popular platforms of the time, like YouTube, Instagram, and now TikTok. But the TikTok literary space, also known as BookTok, is markedly different because of its scope and trendiness. BookTok caters itself toward young people who use the app. The most popular content creators feature literary fiction novels, along with some young adult fiction, mystery, fantasy, poetry, and memoirs mixed in. 
Promoting books on TikTok turns out to be so influential that sometimes popularity and support are garnered overnight. For example, one young TikTok user, Marguerite Richards, made a video about her father’s book "Stone Maidens" that was published in 2012 but had not been widely followed. Richards’ 16-second video was enough to propel her father’s novel to the top of Amazon’s bestseller list in merely a few days, surpassing authors Colleen Hoover and Prince Harry. This is just one of the benefits of BookTok’s popularity. BookTok also allows young people to learn about new genres, find new recommendations based on their interests, connect with a community of book lovers, and possibly promote their own writing to a wide audience. 
These positive aspects of BookTok are present in most other book communities on social media, but TikTok is special because its book content reaches such a large audience that it brings in people who may not be avid readers. BookTok offers a welcoming introduction to reading for all TikTok — numbering over one billion users. This is reflected not only in the millions of views on book-related TikTok videos, but also in book sales. Barnes & Noble sales have increased in the past two years, partially due to the increased popularity of reading in young people. Many Barnes & Noble stores now feature displays showing “as seen on TikTok” books, fully embracing their new consumer base.
Apart from the increased interest in reading and the revenue boosts for bookstores, there are also downsides to communities like BookTok. One of these is a lack of variety in books promoted on social media. On the app, creators often recommend the same or similar books over and over again. Novels such as "Circe" by Madeline Miller, "We Were Liars" by E. Lockhart, and "Red, White & Royal Blue" by Casey McQuiston are a few that have fallen into the cycle of book recommendations. While there are always creators recommending new books, TikTok algorithms tend to boost videos with novels that are already popular because there is such a large audience interest in them. These books have gained popularity in quantities that only social media could produce, which is great for their authors. However, this phenomenon generates a feedback loop in which the handful of books that get significantly promoted on TikTok are often repetitive and homogenous.
Further, many authors get left behind in this popularity game — specifically authors of color. In an article from The Cut, independent bookstore owner Leah Koch explained, “I can’t really think of a single book that’s blown up on BookTok that wasn’t written by a white person.” In the same piece, Sanjana Basker, a BookToker (@baskinsuns) elaborated on the problem. “I think it’s a reflection of a structural misunderstanding — the idea that the white woman is the factory model and everything else is a new edition on top of that, a new thing to consider, instead of the conceptualization of whiteness as a racial identity alongside all of the others — and I think that, given how young the BookTok audience skews, there’s not really a level of self-awareness about that yet.” Additionally, many publishing powerhouses now rely on authors and content to market their books within social media platforms. This means more work on the part of the author and also a skew of popularity based on how adept an author is at using social media. 
We are now seeing that books are certainly not immune from the ever-changing global landscape which simultaneously connects and divides us. On the whole, social media has the power to boost a lot of books, reach out to new readers, and create community. However, it is what is done with that power that will define its role in the years to come.

On February 13th, a gunman opened fire at Michigan State University. Three students were killed: Arielle Diamond Anderson, Brian Fraser, and Alexandria Verner. Five others were injured, and the killer later took his own life. It was a tragedy that rocked East Lansing, and just one of the many shootings that have been occurring in the United States. There’s a lot to be said: on gun control, on dealing with these, and trying to prevent more shootings from happening. Much of it has been said over and over again, not just by my colleagues here at The Tartan, but by national news and federal politicians. Not much changes, and that’s a tragedy as well.
Five days later, the Michigan State Spartans played the Michigan Wolverines in Ann Arbor. The Wolverines, welcoming their fellow Michiganders to the Crisler Center, gave tribute. The stadium was lit up in Michigan State’s green and white, partially thanks to LED bracelets handed out to the student section. There was also a banner that read out "Spartan Strong," and the Wolverines' band practiced and played the Spartans’ alma mater, "MSU Shadows." Tom Izzo, Michigan State basketball coach, gave a comment afterwards: “We played the game to try and make many people back in East Lansing and around the world escape for two hours and enjoy the moment. I thought for the most part, we did our part.”
Every shooting carries trauma with it. At Michigan State, there were students who had survived previous shootings. That is an even larger indictment of this culture. How have we just given up on stopping this trauma from continuing and reaching new audiences?
Izzo is right — his squad played that game to help give people an escape. What does that say about us? What does that say about the country where a game of basketball, where candlelight vigils and speeches, inspiring as they are, replace tangible, genuine action? How many times will we hear thoughts and prayers? How many more times will we read the headline that people died because someone who shouldn’t have had access to a gun had one anyway? 
How much longer will we look for an escape and respite when we could be making change?
I applaud the universities who held vigil for Michigan State. It’s important, now more than ever, that they know we’re in their corner. It’s important, now more than ever, that we show solidarity. And it’s important, now more than ever, that something — anything — changes. Sensible gun control policies have over 85 percent support, and simple background checks, mental health screenings, and trainings would go a long way in preventing something like this from happening. Across the country, we need to step up and make it less easy to just get a gun, and put in steps to prevent a tragedy like this from happening again.
Go Green. Go White. Go State.

This past Thursday was Student Press Freedom Day, with the theme of “Bold Journalism and Brave Advocacy.” We, the members of The Tartan, believe that student journalism is a crucial part of any educational institution and that students should have the freedom to express themselves and their beliefs through the rights granted to them by the First Amendment.
In the 1969 ruling “Tinker v. Des Moines,” the Supreme Court stated that “students did not lose their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech when they stepped onto school property.” While this case dealt with students protesting the Vietnam war by wearing black armbands, the ruling protects all forms of student expression. However, it’s important to note that these rights apply to students at public schools, not private schools. 
Still, in 1988, the Supreme Court case “Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier” ruled that “the school had a legitimate interest in preventing the publication of articles that it deemed inappropriate.” Under the Hazelwood standard, public school administrators have the right to censor student publications if the administration deems something “inappropriate.” But what exactly falls under the realm of “inappropriate”? The ruling states that if the material is “inconsistent with the schools’ education mission,” the school has the authority to limit that speech, even if the government can’t. Why should students have less rights the moment they step through school doors?
The rights granted to student journalists vary by institution. As a college newspaper at Carnegie Mellon, The Tartan has the ability to publish content without any form of prior review. However, high school students (and younger) are subject to the Pennsylvania school code, which states: “School officials may require students to submit for prior approval a copy of materials to be displayed, posted or distributed on school property.” This is prior review, the point at which administrators can censor student publications. 
There are a number of barriers created by the Hazelwood ruling for student journalists. Like mentioned, anything administrators deem “inappropriate” can be censored. An example of this comes from the Lancer Ledger, the student newspaper at General McLane High School in Edinboro, Pa. The story covered “mature” topics, including sex trafficking and pornography. Despite how topical these are to teenagers, administrators called the article, “well-written and educational but not appropriate” and censored it from publication.
So should students be denied exposure to the topics of sex trafficking and pornography while in high school? According to a report from Common Sense Media, a nonprofit which provides reviews and ratings for media and technology, 71 percent of teens aged 13 to 17 stated they intentionally viewed pornography in the last week. Additionally, the average age for a person to become involved in sex trafficking is 12 years old. So are these topics really not appropriate for high schoolers? 
Prior review also may encourage student journalists to self-censor. Even if a student journalist wants to write an article, the idea that an administrator might flag it is discouraging, so they may shy away from topics that challenge the administration. This is an unfortunate practice that is intertwined with prior review and can only be resolved with its removal. 
While The Tartan isn’t affected by prior review, we believe that all student journalists, regardless of education level, should be free to express themselves through whatever means they have, including journalism. Additionally, the current Pennsylvania school code fails to protect student media advisers, like teachers, from retaliation when they support the expression of student journalists. The Tartan fully supports protecting student journalists and their advisers, along with a robust and free student press.
Fortunately for student journalists and journalism advisers, there is a movement called “New Voices” that aims to remove prior review from student expression and protect advisers from administrative retaliation. There are currently 16 states that have implemented laws that protect the First Amendment rights of student journalists. A number of states have introduced New Voices bills and many more having strong organized efforts, including Pennsylvania.  
Though legislation has not yet been introduced in 2023, prime sponsors are committed and bill numbers are expected shortly. The Pennsylvania legislature has a two-year session, and legislation can be introduced at any point during the session.
We, the members of The Tartan, fully support all efforts that aim to remove prior review of student expressions. Students shouldn’t be granted less rights solely because they are students, and teachers should not face retaliation for content published by the students they advise. We believe that teaching students proper journalistic practices is how good journalists are made, and that this kind of censorship has no place in student-run publications. There is no reason why student journalists should have less rights, solely because they are students.
