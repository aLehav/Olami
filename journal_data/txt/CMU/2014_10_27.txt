Competitive video gaming, or eSports, is now taking off in places like the United States, attracting thousands of people to major events. But in South Korea, more than anywhere else, it has already oozed into mainstream culture. Gaming competitions are televised as frequently as traditional sporting competitions.
Such excitement was on display in Seoul on Oct. 19. A sold out crowd of more than 40,000 fans filled the Seoul World Cup Stadium to watch the finale of the world championship for League of Legends, the most popular video game in the world, with 67 million monthly players. The match was also aired on the publisher of League of Legends (Riot’s) website, Twitch, and even ESPN 3, the channel’s live streaming service. This contest involved barely any muscular exertion beyond the furious clicking of fingers on a computer mouse and keyboard, but with corporate sponsors and a million-dollar prize to the winner, the championship series had the dramatic feel of any traditional sports title game.
The match featured a Korean team, Samsung White, which was matched up against a Chinese team, Star Horn Royal Club. Having lost only two games during the entire tournament, which consisted of a group stage followed by a bracket, the Korean team Samsung White was the clear favorite of the match. Their opponents, the Chinese team Star Horn Royal Club, included two Korean players alongside three Chinese players. Much like professional sports organizations, teams in one regional gaming league are able to pick up players from other regions. Samsung White went on to win the championship 3–1 and $1 million in prize money.
Unfortunately for Star Horn Royal Club, their defeat marked the second time in a row that they finished second place in the 2014 World Final.
The tournament as a whole saw better performances from North American teams than in previous years, though in the end it was still the top Asian teams who made it all the way to the finals. South Korea, which is widely considered the haven of eSports, is also home to the best League of Legends players in the world. Many often wonder why it is the case that Asian teams are so dominant in many eSports scenes, and most would say that it’s mainly due to a strictly regimented practice culture. Teams from elsewhere in the world are beginning to get more serious about practice, scrimmages, and competitive play in order to narrow the gap in international tournaments.
The World Championship’s record breaking attendance and viewership numbers makes it clear that League of Legend’s popularity is not waning. 
With the distinction of becoming the most popular eSport in the world comes the responsibility to put on a show worthy of the largest gaming event of the year. Thankfully, the crew at Riot Games did not disappoint. From the enormous World Cup Stadium venue to a live performance from Imagine Dragons, who are League of Legends players themselves, the 2014 World Final was a spectacular success.

Volleyball
Over the weekend, the Carnegie Mellon volleyball team traveled to Juniata College for the Wid Guisler Invitational. It was a rough weekend as they dropped all three of their matches, including two against top 20 teams.
On Friday, the Tartans played Stevenson University, taking them all the way to the fifth set before falling 3–2. After dropping the first two sets 23–25 and 20–25, Carnegie Mellon rallied with straight wins 25–22 and 25–14 before finally falling 10–15. Senior right side hitter Ali Celentano set a season high with her 18 kills while sophomore setter Emily Newton had 36 assists and sophomore defensive specialist Molly Higgins helped on defense with 28 digs.  
Saturday wasn’t much better for the Tartans. Against No. 17 Eastern University, they managed to take the first set 25-23 before dropping the next three 16–25, 9–25 and 17–25 to lose 3–1. Celentano led the team blocks with nine while first-year middle blocker Eliza Donohue had two blocks in the loss.  
Next was No. 10 Juniata, where the Tartans lost in straight sets 17–25, 18–25, 22–25. Donohue led the team in kills in the losing effort with 10 with first-year outside hitter Hannah Wooten leading the way on defense with eight digs. Higgins and Celentano each had seven digs.
Carnegie Mellon wraps up its regular season at Allegheny College on Saturday.
Football
The Carnegie Mellon football team traveled to Saint Vincent College on Saturday and came back home with a bad taste in their mouth after surrendering a large second half lead.
After a turnover on Saint Vincent’s opening drive, the Tartans quickly took a 6–0 lead when junior quarterback Andrew Hearon rushed in for the touchdown on the next play. The next pair of drives was roughly the same another turnover followed by a Hearon touchdown pass to first-year running back Sam Benger two plays later. The teams traded scoreless possessions for the rest of the quarter until Saint Vincent gained great field position, given the Tartans’ inability to punt, and quickly brought the score back to 13–7. The teams traded touchdowns midway through the second half, with Hearon completing another touchdown pass, this time to sophomore wide receiver Matt Forjan.
After a quick four-and-out for Saint Vincent, the Tartans extended their lead further with Hearon’s third touchdown pass, with junior wide receiver Chris Herrera on the receiving end.
This was the end of the good news for the Tartans, as they only managed a single field goal in the second half while blowing their 28–13 half time lead.
Carnegie Mellon finishes up PAC play and hosts Thiel College next Saturday.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams opened up their respective seasons on Saturday as they each faced off against Case Western University in a dual-style meet.
The women’s team dominated, ultimately winning 185–115 on the back of 10 event wins. The Tartans started out on the right note when they cruised to an easy victory in the 200-yard medley relay. First–year Anna Wong, first-year Kim Hochstedler, sophomore Gillian Crews, and first-year Tiana Marrese put up a combined time of 1:50.19 and touched the wall more than two seconds before the top Case Western team.The women kept up the pressure with first-year Miranda Ford and sophomore Kimberly Klausing placing 1–2 in the 100-yard freestyle, touching the wall at times of 10:59.09 and 11:10.49, respectively. 
Wong and junior Kira Singhaus matched the feat in the 100-yard backstroke with times of 1:00.97 and 1:02.77. 
Hochstedler helped the Tartans build their lead as she took first place in the 100-yard breaststroke with a time of 1:08.17.
The team seemed to grow more dominant as the day progressed, with Marrese and sophomore Allison Kirkby taking 1–2 in the 100-yard free style with times of 55.55 and 56.14, respectively, while first-year Emma Shi, first-year Brinda Malhotra, and sophomore Paige Sieffert pulled off the 1–2–3 sweep in the 200-yard backstroke with times of 2:12.10, 2:13.46, and 2:14.24, respectively.
Ford and Klausing added the 5th 1–2 finish of the meet for the Tartans in the 500-yard freestyle, touching the wall at the 5:22.37 and 5:24.59 marks, respectively. For swimming, first-year Mary St. John added the final win of the day in the 400-yard individual medley with a time of 4:44.74.
In the two diving competitions, the Tartans were even more dominant, sweeping 1–2–3 in both the 1-meter and 3-meter dives. Sophomore Machika Kaku, senior Winona Li, and senior Andie Azofeifa led the Tartans to victory in the 1-meter with final scores of 263.65, 217.45, and 201.40 and then switched the order in the 3-meter dive with Li taking first, Kaku second, and Azofeifa in third, this time with scores of 241.51, 237.70, and 205.30.
On the men’s side, Carnegie Mellon was even more successful, winning 187–105 behind 11 event wins. 
Matching the women’s style of winning early and often, the men’s team also started off the meet with a victory in the 200-yard medley relay with senior Josh Lucheon, first-year Matt Chu, sophomore Sivan Mehta, and first-year Kevin Steinhouse combining for the winning time of 1:36.41. First–year Josh Taekman kept the momentum up for the Tartans with his win in the 1,000-yard freestyle victory, clocking in at 9:56.08, more than nine seconds faster than second place.
Carnegie Mellon got its first of many 1–2 finishes in the 200 yard freestyle, with senior Andrew Yee and junior Steven Geier taking the top spots with times of 1:45.50 and 1:45.61, respectively. Mehta bridged the gap between top place sweeps with his win in the 100-yard backstroke in 53.30 seconds before the men swept the top three spots in the 100-yard back stroke with Chu, senior Roy Sung and junior Peter Podniesinski finishing with times of 59.29, 1:00.99, and 1:01.24, respectively.
Sophomore Brian Walsh was the next Tartan winner with his 1:55.03 finish in the 200-yard butterfly before Mehta and Steinhouse took 1–2 in the 100-yard freestyle with times of 47.97 and 48.57. Carnegie Mellon then followed up with another 1–2–3 sweep with junior Jay Jin, Taekman, and first-year Michael Dibacco taking the top spots in the 200-yard backstroke with times of 1:57.72, 1:58.21, and 1:58.40, respectively.
Sung and Podniesinski combined for a 1–2 finish in the 200-yard breaststroke, finishing with times of 2:14.07 and 2:15.92, while Yee took the top spot in the 500-yard freestyle, touching the wall at the 4:48.34 mark. Mehta added his fourth win of the day in the 100-yard butterfly as he edged out Case Western with a time of 51.50.
The only major deviation between the men’s and women’s days came on the diving board where juniors Yannos Michailidis and Noah Fatsi looked uncomfortable and well behind the top Case Western competitor.
Both squads will next swim on Saturday when they host Clarion University of Pennsylvania.

Max Levchin, co-founder and former chief technology officer of PayPal, visited Carnegie Mellon on Tuesday. Levchin currently runs HVF, which stands for Hard, Valuable, Fun, and is an umbrella for various big data projects. HVF has spun out two companies, Affirm and Glow, both of which solve innovative problems using big data.
Glow is an app that helps couples, typically in their 30s or 40s, who are trying to have a child. It relies on the power of big data to help women predict the times when they are most likely to conceive. Women who want to conceive use the app to note down their mood and body vitals, including basal body temperature, period cycle, and other metrics. Glow analyzes all this data and uses it to come up with a model that can predict the time period during which a woman is most likely to conceive, down to a few hours. Glow also provides a way for couples to allay the cost of infertility treatment, should they need it after ten months of regularly using the app to try to conceive.
Levchin also spoke about his other venture, Affirm, which looks to redefine consumer credit by allowing users to make payments in fixed monthly installments. The service is consumer-friendly in that it is committed to “clear, upfront pricing,” and doesn’t charge any hidden fees. The amount of each installment is decided at checkout, and the service uses big data to model the consumer credit reliability and decide the fixed fee that each customer must pay for the loan.
Levchin is a supporter for women in technology, and believes that there is a lack of female role models for young women interested in science and technology. He said he hopes to scour Silicon Valley for what he called “women nerds” like Marissa Mayer, the chief executive officer of Yahoo. He hopes that “elevating them to the front page … of TechCrunch” will help provide inspiration for young girls. He noted that young girls need such women to look up to and justified it, saying, “As much as I would love to, I should not be my daughter’s inspiration.”

Every year, six Nobel Prizes are awarded for achievements in medicine and physiology, physics, chemistry, literature, economics, and peace initiatives. These are some of the highest awards that a professional can receive in recognition for their work, documenting projects that often took decades to finish. However, if you were asked to explain why some of these titans in their field received the credit that they did, would you be able to?
Last Monday, the Carnegie Mellon University Lecture Series, the Triple Helix, and the Mellon College of Science hosted a panel discussion in Doherty Hall featuring Carnegie Mellon professors who explained what made the discoveries of the Nobel Prizes from 2014 special.
First, Alison Barth, associate professor in biological sciences at Carnegie Mellon, spoke about the prize for physiology and medicine. This year, the prize was awarded to Edvard Moser, May-Britt Moser, and John O’Keefe, three neuroscientists who got their claim to fame through research in memory and spatial navigation.
According to her explanation, the three scientists received the Prize for their work published in 2005 which described how space is represented in the brain. Working with mice, they were able to track the activity of specific neurons in the mice’s brains. What they saw was that as the mice ran around randomly inside a box, the neurons in the hippocampus, an area highly associated with spatial navigation, would fire in a grid-like formation. No matter how the mouse walked, this grid remained true.
Barth joked that every time a scientist sees something with some semblance of a pattern, they get excited. That was the case here. 
The three scientists used this basis to explain that there are certain cells in our brain, called place cells, that keep track of our physical surroundings by maintaining some sort of grid.
Next, Marcel Bruchez, associate professor of biological sciences and chemistry at Carnegie Mellon, spoke about the prize awarded in the field of chemistry. 
Providing a backstory to the reason this year’s chemistry Prize was awarded, Bruchez explained how an early 20th century scientist named Ernst Abbe declared that the best possible resolution that our microscopes would be able to pick up is 200 nanometers.
Resolution refers to the ability of a microscope to delineate between two points. This limit was called Abbe’s Law of Limiting Resolution. However, in the early 2000s, Eric Betzig, Stefan W. Hell, and William E. Moerner broke this law.
They were interested in solving this problem because a resolution of 200 nanometers is not sufficient for modern research. Since many of the molecules in our cells are on the order of less than 10 nanometers, 200 nanometers simply cannot give enough information. The three professors were able to find a way past this limit, all the way down to a resolution of 48 nanometers.
They did this by exploiting the fact that they could observe very small points of a picture at a very high resolution. Once they worked that out, they propagated the area of observation over the entire sample until the entire piece was observed in the high resolution.
Finally, Randall Feenstra, professor of physics at Carnegie Mellon University, explained the Nobel Prize in physics: The research of Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano, and Shuji Nakamura, which was published around 20 years ago and which was centered on finding a way to make blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
These blue LEDs were an important discovery because they enabled a low-energy source of white light. Also, their work resulted in LEDs that could omit red, green, and blue. This means that they could be used to display any color necessary now.
The problem was that in the past, when people attempted to make a blue LED, they were unable to create one that would last long and wouldn’t deteriorate. On a basic level, an LED is made by taking some element and forming a crystal out of it. In the past, a specific element was used that allowed for kinks to form and errors to be replicated, deteriorating the light. However, the three scientists used the compound gallium nitride (GaN), which filled in the kinks in the crystal to ensure that the light worked.
Turnout for the event was quite large, as the entire lecture hall was filled. The university plans to make these talks an annual event, in order to continue to provide students the opportunity to better understand the science behind these awards.
Editor's note: Rohan Varma is the editor-in-chief of the Triple Helix at Carnegie Mellon.

After keeping them secret for many years, a number of prominent tech companies have recently released diversity statistics for their workforces. Even the companies in question agree that they are disappointing. Only 18 percent of Facebook’s software engineers are female. For Google, 17 percent of tech workers are female. Microsoft, Amazon, and many others report similar numbers. 
As some Pugwash members pointed out, the problem isn’t restricted to computer science either; the statistics are similar in engineering and perhaps even worse in physics and math. Hence, this week Pugwash aimed to determine to what extent this gender ratio is a problem and what, if anything, should be done about it. Since diversity is a complex subject, we focused only on gender in the tech workplace. While we acknowledge that minority races and other groups have also been the subject of unequal treatment, and that the workplace is not the only place where prejudice can be a problem (the Internet and massively multiplayer video games were mentioned as other places), a single hour was not enough to discuss them all.
Before proposing ways to promote diversity in the workplace, it’s important to first understand the impact that society can have on professions chosen by different genders. This question turns out to be remarkably difficult to answer, since it’s unethical to run controled experiments which might profoundly alter a person’s job choices.
First, if it’s not social factors, then what could it be? Biology likely plays some role in professional development. The brains of men and women have measurably different architectures. For example, research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has shown that women have more connections between the two hemispheres of their brains. Furthermore, evolutionary psychology suggests that the different societal roles played by our ancestors based on gender may have influenced innate skills and proclivities.
But does biology explain the differences we’re seeing? Almost certainly not. According to research recently summarized by NPR, up until about 1984, women’s participation in law, physical sciences, medicine, and computer science were all increasing rapidly, and at about the same pace. However, after 1984, women’s participation in computer science started dropping, in stark contrast to the other skilled professions. Biology, which remains roughly constant over time, can hardly explain this shift. Research by UCLA professor Jane Margolis provides a different explanation. In the mid ’80s, computers were marketed toward boys, likely because marketers connected them with toy tools like Tonka trucks. Overall, Pugwash agreed that society’s biases — giving toy tools to boys and dolls to girls — can have profound effects on children. Worse, these effects compound with age, as women feel more isolated in traditionally male-dominated fields like computer science.
There are two reasons that this is a problem. First, inequality is fundamentally unethical. If a woman would be happiest as a computer scientist, then it’s harmful to deny her that opportunity or to somehow degrade her experience in the position relative to a man’s. Second, it’s inefficient. The world is at its most productive when everyone with computer science talent can make use of it.
Pugwash agreed that this is a problem rooted in society and culture. What can be done about it? The idea of affirmative action — in the sense of promoting women even when they are not the most qualified — was endorsed by some and criticized by others. While affirmative action will increase women’s participation in tech in the short term, it may inadvertently decrease women’s confidence in their skills, causing them to leave the field later. Less drastic measures were more popular. For instance, employers should be aware of their own biases and combat them during the hiring process. Parents should also avoid propagating biases through their children’s play activities and ensure that girls have as many opportunities as boys to engineer and solve problems.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a discussion on gender inequality in the technology industry.

The whole world has been gripped by the recent Ebola virus outbreak, with multiple countries attempting to establish effective practices to prevent the spread of the pathogen. In addition to the active battle against the virus, there is a newfound interest in fully understanding the virus to determine why it is so pernicious.
The scientific community has known about the Ebola virus since the first reported outbreak in 1976. The virus is not always around but emerges in outbreaks. The largest previous outbreak occurred in 2000 and affected 425 people with a fatality rate of 53 percent according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Currently, the world is experiencing the largest outbreak to date with recent statistics by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reporting a total of 10,141 cases with 4,922 deaths.
However, when compared to the leading causes of death, the Ebola virus doesn’t even compare to the number of cases and deaths for other diseases such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, or even influenza (the flu). Ebola has garnered a notorious reputation because it can be spread through bodily fluids and has been characterized by the WHO as “a severe, often fatal illness with an average fatality rate of 50 percent.” Additionally, there are currently no approved treatments or vaccines.
A recent survey by the Harvard School of Public Health reported that in the United States alone, 40 percent of Americans believe that there will be a large outbreak of Ebola, and 25 percent believe that someone in their immediate family will be affected. A lot of these fears are far from reality since many experts believe that an Ebola outbreak of that scope in the U.S. is near impossible. Ebola can be prevented with effective practices and a strong medical infrastructure.
One important question scientists are trying to answer is why this outbreak has been the deadliest to date. The origin of the virus this year has been traced back to Guéckédou, a small town that is in the southern corner of Guinea. Its location near the borders of Liberia and Sierra Leone allowed the virus to spread in these countries, which are ranked as three of the poorest in the world. Their lack of medical expertise and corrupt governments without proper infrastructure has caused the death toll to escalate.
Like most viruses, the various strains of the Ebola virus all rely on the host for their survival and replication. Once in the body, the virus inserts its genetic material into our cells and uses our cells’ machinery to replicate itself. Once producing progeny, the virus will cause the infected cell to explode, releasing the newly constructed virus. This cycle continues as the virus spreads to multiple organ systems. As cells die, more complications arise.
The first symptoms are the sudden onset of fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding.Everyday we are exposed to a variety of pathogens such as bacteria and viruses, but our body has a powerful immune system that protects us from getting sick. 
The cells of the immune system that travel through the bloodstream are able to differentiate the proteins on the outer surfaces of foreign particles and the proteins found on normal body cells. While identifying a pathogen, the immune system produces antibodies that can bind to and target the pathogen. The killer cells of the immune system identify this antibody and engulf and destroy the pathogen.
In the case of Ebola, the virus is adept at infecting the cells of the immune system, reducing their count in the bloodstream and thus limiting the immune system’s effectiveness. 
This allows the virus to propagate in the body and overcome the immune system.
Scientists do not lack treatments or vaccines because the Ebola virus is too scientifically complex to treat. The fault can be put on drug companies that ignored developing Ebola drugs because of the small subset of people that were actually being infected. Their priority is to focus on diseases which affect a large population so that, in the end, they make more revenue.
The recent Ebola outbreak has led to a renewed interest in developing a drug. The fundamental tenet of general virus treatments and vaccines is the enhancement of the body’s immune system to be better fitted to kill the disease. A vaccine works by exposing the body to a harmless version of the same virus so that the body recognizes it and creates antibodies against the virus. The body’s immune system has the ability to remember pathogens that have infected it so if the virus ever enters the body, its response will quickly and efficiently destroy the virus before symptoms arise.
Vaccines can only help to prevent a disease but will not be useful for those who are already infected. BioCryst Pharmaceuticals is currently developing a drug that directly targets the virus’s ability to replicate. 
The company has seen success in treating similar symptoms in monkeys. Another company, Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, is developing a treatment using a new technique in biotechnology that involves encapsulating RNA molecules in fats and lipids. The RNA specific for the virus has the ability to enter the infected cells and bind to the virus RNA, preventing it from replicating itself. 
Many of the details of these treatments are kept secret as these companies are competing to develop the most efficient drug. 
After developing a viable treatment plan, it takes an extended period of time to conduct the necessary clinical trials and get FDA approval before the drug can be mass produced and administered. In the case of Ebola, the Food and Drug Administration is trying to speed up trials to get the treatments out into the public. GlaxoSmithKline is already in the first phase of clinical trials and estimate that they will have a drug sometime in 2015.
Still, the only thing medical professionals can currently do is provide Ebola patients with basic supportive care such as maintaining hydration. They must also ensure that their interaction with others is limited to prevent transmission.

Researchers create self-assembling microscale proteins
At the New York University Polytechnic School of Engineering, associate professor Jin Kim Monteclare and a group of collaborators designed nanoscale proteins bound to curcumin, a cancer therapeutic. The outcome was successful, self-assembling nanoscale proteins, which can bind to small molecules through a hydrophobic core.
To the researchers’ surprise, the fibers of the protein grew from a nanoscale to a microscale diameter during incubation with curcumin. The significant jump in size can potentially lead to new opportunities for using engineered protein fibers in the fields of medicine and nanotechnology, such as for scaffolds in tissue engineering or in nanowires for biosensors.
Through fluorescent microscopy, the group was also able to confirm the homogenous distribution of curcumin throughout the fiber.
Their results have been published in the journal Biomacromolecules.

New app solves math equations with phone camera
Photomath is a new smartphone app that allows the user to receive an instant solution to a math expression by simply taking a photo of the printed problem. 
The app also provides detailed instructions for finding the solution.
Earlier last week, PhotoMath was launched at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in London. Free of charge, the app is currently available in the iTunes store.
For the past few years, the company Microblink has been working on developing algorithms that have enhanced the accuracy and speed of its text recognition technology. Through the app, Microblink hopes to promote its machine vision technology to other potentially interested companies.
While the app has its limitations, including the inability to recognize handwritten text or compute problems beyond middle school math, the company is focused on continuing to improve its technologies.

Large sunspot rotates toward and affects Earth
A sunspot facing Earth, called AR2192, has captured the attention of solar observatories and amateur astronauts. With an 80,000-mile diameter that could contain Jupiter, it is the largest observed sunspot since the beginning of the solar cycle in 2008.
Viewed as dark patches in the sun’s photosphere, sunspots cover regions of intense solar magnetism. AR2192 has emitted intense flare activity that resulted in brief, high-frequency radio blackouts around the globe. Blackouts occur when radiation from the solar flares cause ionization effects in the Earth’s upper atmosphere, or ionosphere.
Precautions have been taken to minimize the damaging impacts of the solar flares, including advising aircraft to avoid traveling in certain regions, as well as telling workers at the International Space Station to stay in well-shielded areas. Unfortunately, parts of Sweden have already experienced small power outages.

Nine cases of Ebola have been reported in the U.S.
Last month, Thomas E. Duncan was admitted to the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. He became the first patient in the U.S. to be diagnosed with Ebola, a deadly viral disease.
Since then, more U.S. patients have been diagnosed with Ebola. Nina Pham, one of two nurses that was treating Duncan, became the first person to contract the disease. After being treated in Texas for several days, Pham was transported to a special containment unit at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md.
The other nurse, Amber Vinson, also displayed symptoms of Ebola. She was quickly transported to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Ga. Emory, as well as the Nebraska Medical Center, have played a role in the recoveries of a few other Ebola patients.
Recently, Dr. Craig Spencer, a doctor in New York City became the ninth case of Ebola in the U.S..

Man’s genome from 45,000 years ago is reconstructed
A current paper in Nature showcases the work of a research team that had reconstructed the complete genome of a 45,000-year-old man by using samples from a thighbone. 
Originating from the Irtysh River in Siberia, near the Ust’-Ishim settlement, the bone is the oldest modern human fossil ever found outside of Africa and the Near East.
Svante Pääbo, a Swedish biologist, and his team created the genome by overlapping DNA fragments sampled from the bone. From there, they discovered that the owner belonged to a lineage that gave rise to all non-African humans around 60,000 years ago. Also, by comparing the amount of Neanderthal DNA in the ancient man and in living humans, the scientists estimated the rate at which the Neanderthal DNA had fragmented. In turn, they presented strong evidence that early humans had interbred with Neanderthals.

Space simulation of Mars taking place near a volcano
In mid-October, Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) team members began their space travel simulation in a Mars-like habitat on Earth. For eight months, six crew members and two backups will live in a geodesic dome located on the side of the Hawaiian volcano, Mauna Loa. The basaltic terrain and sparse vegetation near Mauna Loa will mirror environmental conditions on Mars.
Inside the dome are two floors. The 878-square-foot ground floor includes a kitchen, bathroom, laboratory, and exercise room. On the 424-square-foot second floor are six small bedrooms. The aim of the simulation is to study the human factors that contribute to astronaut crew function and performance over time. Funded by NASA, the project will be the longest space travel simulation conducted in the U.S.

Last week, the Helen Wayne Rauh Theater in the Purnell Center came alive with the world premiere of three original works ­— Babylon, Stupid Ghost, and The Recluse — written by Carnegie Mellon School of Drama master’s students performed by acting undergraduates. Known as the School of Drama’s New Works Series, which sees an installment each fall and spring, the shows saw multiple performances between October 22 and 24th.
Babylon
Babylon, written by master’s dramatic writing student Dan Giles and directed by masters directing student Terrence Mosley, started out completely black with noises of wind and wind chimes heightening awareness of sound. The light rose to reveal a bed, a table with four stools, a kitchen cart, and various plants, books, dolls, and shoes to demarcate the different areas in the house (bedroom, kitchen, and outdoor space). It was a rather dingy set with the bed frame vandalized and a bare mattress, along with minimal kitchen supplies.
As the chimes subsided, audience members were introduced to fraternal twins Sam (junior musical theatre major Josh Grosso) and Liza (junior acting major Chante Adams). They stay up until midnight in anticipation of their 17th birthday. Liza climbs into Sam’s bed as they reminisce about the past 17 years. It soon becomes obvious they are orphans; or at least that their parents are no longer in their lives. Their words become a whirlwind as the memories and nostalgia turn into a tornado of conversation. The audience was so immersed in the dialogue when I attended the show, that genuine surprise could be heard in the form of gasps when Liza kissed Sam. (Taboo subjects within the first 20 minutes, check.)
Taken aback and shocked, Liza and Sam go back to sleep while Owen (junior musical theatre major Avery Smith), their older brother, enters the kitchen to start the birthday breakfast. He fiddles with a sign that says “HAPPY BARTHDAY.” (Hmmm…that’s curious, he doesn’t know how to spell birthday?) Owen paces madly through the kitchen as he scrubs the table and readies the area, setting out the plates and utensils. Liza and Sam wake up and the tension is palpable between them. It also doesn’t help that Owen has a favorable disposition toward Liza. So with the sour attitude from Owen and his uncertainty about his relationship with his sister, Sam explodes on Owen, telling him he should have actually killed himself when he had the chance.
At this point I have deduced three things: one, Owen is bipolar or schizophrenic, or both; two, this is probably some apocalyptic future (10 years post-apocalyptic, to be exact), and three, their father was most likely taken by this apocalypse. We also figure out there is an incestuous love triangle amongst Sam, Liza, and Owen: Liza likes Sam, Owen likes Sam, and Sam is just confused.
But it isn’t until Owen has a bad spell and is convinced he is able to fly with angels, that things take a turn for the worst. Persuaded that he must cut pages out of books in order for that to happen, Owen advances toward a book with a knife in hand. Sam wants to keep the books pristine, as they are the only ones that exist as far as he knows. Sam is able to swipe the knife from his hands, but when a lost stranger comes into the house, Sam’s attention is averted. In Sam’s moment of distraction, Owen is able to grab the knife and stabs the stranger straight in the stomach. Intermission falls and the audience is left wondering if the stranger is dead or alive.
A 10 minute intermission becomes six months in the world of Babylon, and the stranger, Mason, is alive. In fact, he has gotten quite close with Liza since the last time we left him. This becomes a point of tension when he reveals to her that he raped a 13 year-old when he was 34. Meanwhile, in a fit of hysteria, Owen storms off into the post-apocalyptic outside just to have Sam run after him. Shortly after Sam returns with shivering Owen (it’s the middle of winter at this point), Mason leaves due to his resurfacing feelings toward much younger girls (read: Liza). As all three siblings lie in bed, Sam discloses to Liza his desire to look for their dad in “the city”, convinced he is still alive. She does not want him to leave her, and Sam says he will stay. But right after Liza falls asleep, Sam escapes. Liza wakes up to find Sam is no longer in the house, and has a good ol’ fashioned freak out a lá The Real Housewives of New Jersey. The play concludes with Liza daydreaming about having a child and naming her Summer — a season she vaguely remembers.
Babylon, being the most dramatic of the three plays, has an extra dimension of thoughtfulness. Giles clearly took the time to consider how three people would live if, for all they know, they were the only three people on the planet. The concept of a secret is useless, and the uncertainty of the future weighs heavily on them. The actors did a phenomenal job encompassing this idea well. Shout out to Smith, whose portrayal of a mentally ill man slowly going over the edge was hypnotizing.
Stupid Ghost
Master’s dramatic writing student Savannah Reich’s hilarious Stupid Ghost, directed by John Wells Directing Fellow Ben Gansky, did not conform to a typical dramatic format. When I first walked in, the actors were already on the stage wearing the stereotypical ghost costume, white sheets with eyeholes cut out. They padded around the littered stage and “OOOOHHH!”-ed like ghosts as the speakers blasted white noise and occasional bursts of music. They each carried around seemingly random objects: a whisk, a red canoe paddle, a scuba mask, a rotary phone, etc.
The dialogue started with the removal of a sheet to reveal a girl (junior musical theatre major Amanda Jerry) with stark white makeup, wearing a sign around her neck, which is invisible to everyone else, labeled “GHOST.” She was joined by another ghost labeled as “Poltergeist” (junior acting major Ryan Avalos) in the program, to explain that ghosts aren’t as terrifying as one thinks; they just want to follow you, no scary business. Cue Veronica “Ronnie” (junior musical theatre major Erika Olson), who walks through the forest with a sign around her neck that says “PRETTY GIRL.” As the Ghost spots her, she instantly becomes infatuated. She follows her around, but restrains herself when it comes to interacting with her. The Poltergeist teases and tempts the Ghost to do more by possessing Ronnie’s mother (Note: Sign around the Poltergeist’s neck now says “MOTHER (POSSESSED)”). As Ronnie’s mother, the Poltergeist is in a position of power to mess with the Ghost.
Later that night, a teenage boy (as noted on his sign) named Jean Pierre (junior musical theatre major Adam Stern-Rand) invites Ronnie to the lake, simultaneously bragging about going off to college while she is stuck back home for one more year. Ronnie declines the invitation as she has homework to do. Ronnie goes back to her books, but becomes distracted when the telephone rings. It is the Ghost. The Ghost is desperate at this point to have some kind of interaction, so she pretends to be Ronnie’s human friend, which, easy to assume, does not go smoothly. When Ronnie exits the room, the Ghost pretends to be Ronnie. The Ghost sits at Ronnie’s desk, does the same expressions as her, and tries on Ronnie’s headband for the rest of the night. The Ghost walks outside where she runs into Jean Pierre. He notices the Ghost; In fact, he thinks she’s Ronnie. The headband the Ghost had put on has made her human and, in a moment of excitement the Ghost agrees to go down to the lake, despite what actual Ronnie had said. At this point, the Poltergeist knows what’s going on in terms of headbands, so he proceeds to lock Ronnie in her room to avoid revealing themselves.
Ronnie has no idea what is going on and goes full angsty-teenager mode. Meanwhile, in a canoe on the lake, the Ghost and Jean Pierre get romantic and decide to go a step further by having sex. Jean Pierre and the Ghost move onto an island where Ronnie, who escaped from her room, spots them. She is able to faintly see Jean Pierre and another girl. She calls out his name, but can’t be heard since the music is turned up too loud. Afterward, Ronnie ends up wandering the streets all night and falling asleep in a ditch. She wakes up the day of a Halloween party: a Halloween party where everyone dresses as a ghost (callback to the beginning). It is at this party where the Ghost and Ronnie take off their sheets to find out they are the same person. This revelation makes Ronnie frantic as the Ghost and Jean Pierre drive off in a car. Jean Pierre is incredibly confused, and the Ghost is incredibly overwhelmed by all the chaos she set off. With all these thoughts in her head the Ghost does not see Ronnie in the middle of the street. She crashes into her, not only killing Ronnie, but also killing Jean Pierre and leaving them in the same place as they were in the beginning: padding around pointlessly in the sound of white noise as ghosts.
Stupid Ghost was an unexpectedly funny play that was still rooted in a larger moral question. Just like Babylon, Stupid Ghost flirted with themes of life and death due to the delightfully on point, and at times self-deprecating, writing of Reich. But the comedy is not just in the writing. This play is for anyone who is a fan of physical comedy. From clueless, clumsy cooking to uninhibited, flailing dance numbers, not one of the actors in the group dragged the lightness of humor down. The audience was a constant chorus of laughter, knowing where to laugh and where to remain silent. This kind of play makes an impact based on how harmoniously the comedic and dramatic elements coexist.
The Recluse; or The Rise and Fall of a Makeshift Pal
The Recluse; or The Rise and Fall of a Makeshift Pal, written by master’s dramatic writing student Stephen Webb and directed by assistant acting professor Andrew Smith, is a dark comedy about a very lonely artist. His name is Herman (junior acting major Colin Whitney). He’s been walking into his art studio (a converted basement in his dead parent’s home) every day, and every day he takes a piece of cardboard and paints a sad face on it. His parents have passed away, and he is an only child without any friends, so Herman decides to build his own friend out of cardboard, paper plates, duct tape, and paint brushes. He names his new friend Hightower. Herman soon realizes that pieces of cardboard stuck together can’t talk, and concludes there is nothing left to live for. He attempts to hang himself before a voice tells him to stop. It’s Hightower (junior acting major Zach Fifer).
Hightower (a large puppet voiced by an actor) is able to talk, walk, and dance with his new pal Herman. Herman’s newfound pal inspires him to draw something different than sad faces — happy faces. Hightower then sings a song with lyrics that include, “If there’s more than two of us, then someone’s gotta go.” The first indicator that this relationship is dangerously close flies over Herman’s head. He’s just happy to have a friend. When Herman proposes to take his happy faces out into the world and sell them, Hightower completely shuts it down. Hightower believed those paintings were just for them, not for anyone else: example number two of a dangerous relationship.
After Hightower goes to sleep, Herman sneaks back down to his art studio to take the paintings out. However, after a little bit, he has a change of heart and returns the paintings; But not before Hightower noticed that they were missing. They get into a big fight with Hightower calling Herman “not faithful,” but ultimately making up after Herman confesses that Hightower saved his life. And after singing their signature song (“If there’s more than two of us, then someone’s gotta go”), in walks someone else, right on cue. It’s a fading art dealer by the 
name of Francesca Del Monte (junior musical theatre major Molly Griggs).
Francesca had spotted Herman outside of an art store and got a “tingling feeling.” She even brought up Leroy (junior musical theatre major Chris Garber), a much older decrepit man who bears a resemblance to Herman. This man scares Herman of what his future will look like and Herman is now eager to impress Francesca, which might jumpstart his career. Sadly, none of his sad faces or happy faces impress her. But Del Monte is still convinced that he has the pièce de résistance hidden away somewhere. She begs him to show her anything new, but if Herman were to show Francesca Hightower, it might separate them.
Francesca and Leroy leave, still suspicious that Herman is hiding something. So they come back later at night and find Hightower. Francesca believes Hightower is a piece of art that will solve all of her gallery troubles. She is ecstatic, but is derailed when Herman is woken up by the commotion. Herman comes downstairs to see that Francesca has found Hightower. In an effort to keep Hightower with him and prove Hightower belongs in the studio, Herman screams with all his might to make Hightower talk. The effort fails but Francesca decides to leave Hightower in the studio; It is clear Herman is way too attached. Francesca leaves the studio and, instantly regretful, Herman slaps the life out of Hightower and goes back to a life of painting sad faces.
If Babylon and Stupid Ghost had a baby, this play would be the outcome. The performance was a perfect mixture of seriousness and levity. It started on a heavy note and ended on a heavy note, but Griggs, as Francesca, was able to lift the middle of the play while still playing an outrageously hilarious character. The color scheme throughout the play was also well executed. In the beginning, Herman practically blended in with his studio filled with cardboard, but when bright red Francesca walks in, she pops in the scene and marks the turning point in the play. It is also worth noting the pleasantly surprising use and excellent execution of puppeteering (a lá Avenue Q).
New Works gave a good range of plays that has me on the look out for next year’s crop of talented actors, directors, playwrights, and production teams.

The first striking thing about the School of Music’s production of Benjamin Britten’s adaptation of John Gay’s The Beggar’s Opera was that it looked put together by beggars — intentionally, of course. The ragged-looking curtains pulled back to reveal a patchwork backdrop and a cast dressed in a mixture of modern and 18th-century clothing in this production, which ran Wednesday through Saturday.
The opera itself focuses on an assortment of motley characters from amongst the seediest members of English society in the 1700s. Polly Peachum is the daughter of Mr. Peachum, a man who works with thieves to sell their goods, and Mrs. Peachum, a prostitute. Polly’s parents are mortified that their daughter, whom they have raised all her life to cheat men out of their money, would of all things marry highwayman Captain Macheath — and for love, not even for money! Seeing that the match would otherwise be unprofitable, they encourage Polly to turn her husband in for money and tell her that if she will not, they will.
This story is not exactly one about star-crossed lovers. Although Macheath pledges his devotion to Polly when in her presence, the moment she is out of earshot, he cavorts with every prostitute in town. We later find that he is also married to jailer Lockit’s daughter Lucy, who is pregnant with his child. And Lucy is none too happy about being forsaken for Polly.
Unfortunately, members of the audience unfamiliar with the story might not have known this if it were not for the synopsis in the program; the weakest point of the production was that it was extremely confusing to follow. As a result of the 18th-century dialogue and the British accents that the performers put on, it was difficult to understand what anyone was saying. This confusion became even worse during the singing parts; operatic singing is already somewhat hard to make out, and with the addition of the two previously listed factors, the performers might as well have been singing in a completely different language, although the opera is in English. Captions, especially during these singing parts, would have been highly appreciated.
The Friday night production starred master’s student in vocal performance Erin Schmura as Polly, senior vocal performance major Zachary Mendez as Macheath, senior vocal performance major Raphael McCorey as Peachum, master’s student in vocal performance Courtney Elvira as Mrs. Peachum, junior vocal performance major Garret Eucker as Lockit, and senior vocal performance major Adrienne Lotto as Lucy. There were a number of hilarious performances: Elvira was comically over the top as Mrs. Peachum, a stereotypical overbearing mother à la Mrs. Bennet if the latter were a prostitute. She played well off McCorey, who was more of the straight man. Another scene which drew fits of laughter from the audience involved Mrs. Trapes, a minor character played by senior vocal performance major Ethan Crystal. To the audience, Mrs. Trapes was obviously a man in drag but this fact seemed to be unnoticed by Lockit and Peachum, who kissed and flirted with her.
Though it may have been difficult to understand, the singing itself was amazing. Just listening to them briefly, it is evident that the songs are difficult pieces to sing, though the performers pulled them off wonderfully. The music is gorgeous: Derived from English folk music, the pieces were clear and lively like a country spring. The flute burst in trills and thrills while the violin sang, with varied percussion throughout.
“All In a Misty Morning,” Captain Macheath’s dance song, and “Fill Every Glass,” a drinking song sung by the thieves, are both lively folksy pieces. “Would You Have a Young Virgin?,” in which Macheath sings about his womanizing, is ironically set to a sweet violin piece. In “Thus When a Good Housewife Sees a Rat,” in which Lucy sings to Macheath about his philandering, we see Lotto having much fun rolling her Rs. Polly’s aria in Act II, Scene 13 is accompanied by the gentle sounds of a harp and chorus. It is a very sweet song, and Schmura was an excellent singer who pulled off Polly’s purity and dedication very convincingly.
When you could understand what was being said, the witty banter and dialogue were the highlight of the show. Gay’s work is a satire of English society at the time. It explores class and gender relations in 18th-century England, which was a much more bawdy time than is often depicted in the popular imagination. There are no ladies curtsying, gentlemen tipping hats at one another, or people sipping tea while conversing with words like “shall” and “indubitably.” Instead, we find a society where parents address their daughters as sluts in casual conversation, drinking and gambling are rampant, and all the men are thieves and all the women are prostitutes.
Some of the funniest scenes are when Polly and her parents discuss her marriage. “Do you think your mother and I should have liv’d comfortably so long together, if ever we had been married?” Peachum exclaims. “What would many a wife give for such an opportunity!” Polly’s mother tells her when she proposes that Polly should kill her own husband. When Polly expresses sadness at the thought of parting with her husband when he is dead, her father proclaims, “Parting with him! Why, this is the whole scheme and intention of all marriage articles!”
Overall, the production offered a unique aesthetic and wonderful music. Hopefully, you made sure to read the Sparknotes beforehand!

“We’re going to play a little game tonight. We’re going to pretend this is Monday night football, and I’m the quarterback,” Jodi Picoult, author of many well-known books including My Sister’s Keeper, said as she took the stage to applause at the Carnegie Music Hall as part of the Literary Evenings’s Monday Night Lecture series.
Picoult, addressing a sold out auditorium on the heels of the release of her new book Leaving Time, spoke to the audience about the research she does for her works of fiction. Doesn’t fiction mean that a story is made up?
While Picoult writes stories that come from the inner machinations of her brain, she often bases them around real-world things that need to be experienced to be properly explained to readers. And boy, were her experiences eye-opening. Although I’ve never read a book by Picoult, she has convinced me to try one out this winter break.
Picoult first related the research she performed for her book Second Glance, published in 2003. In the book, the narrator, Ross Wakeman, comes to Comtosook, Vt. when Abenaki Indian tribe land is being eyed for a shopping mall. If the tribe proves it was a burial ground, the mall cannot be built. Ross, a ghost hunter, comes to the town as its people are being haunted and finds out that the ghost is someone he is falling head over heels for.
To write this book, Picoult not only had to research the Abenaki tribe, but also the Vermont eugenics program, a program in which the Abenaki were forced to disband or go underground as the government sterilized them so that they could not reproduce.
Additionally, Picoult spent some time with real ghost hunters, the Atlantic Paranormal Society in Rhode Island. “If some of you have seen the TV show on the Syfy channel, Ghost Hunters, it was those guys. I knew them before they were famous. They were just ... plumbers doing this on the side,” Picoult said.
“So at the time I was going ghost hunting, my oldest son was about eight/nine years old, and he was terrified of ghosts,” Picoult continued. “So here I am going, ‘Honey, there’s no such thing as a ghost,’ and then packing my bag to go ghost hunting.”
Picoult next related the research she performed for The Storyteller, a book about a woman who is confided in by a former Nazi commander living in America who wants her to help him die.
To understand what she was writing about, Picoult talked to numerous Holocaust survivors, including survivors of concentration camps, death marches, and the ghettos. In one story Picoult told, a boy named Bernie pried a mezuzah from his doorway as he was taken from his home.
Last but not least, Picoult explained the research that went into her latest book, Leaving Time.
The book touches upon elephants’ expression of grief, which the protagonist’s mother studied before she disappeared. “Ultimately, this is a book about how the people who leave us never really do,” Picoult said. “And I began to dive into the world of elephants, knowing I was going to use it as a metaphor, so tonight what I’m going to be telling you about is everything you wanted to know about elephants and more.”
Picoult explained that she worked with a neurobiologist to understand the human brain and then learned how it was similar to and different from elephant brains. She then went to The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee, as well as Botswana, to work with researchers who track elephant migration patterns. Picoult said that elephants are recognizable by voice, tusks, hair, and ears. No two elephants have the same ears. She also explained that elephants have complex brains capable of remembering, feeling pain and loss, and learning. Elephants also won’t leave each other behind, according to Picoult. Picoult culminated her talk about elephants by relating the importance of ending poaching.
Picoult doesn’t just live in the world; she experiences it. From her talk, it is apparent that she’s not afraid to ask someone for help in order to understand what they are an expert on. What better way is there to learn than to ask someone who is itching to share what they know? Picoult seems to have mastered the art of delving wholeheartedly into another person’s story to understand where they come from or why what they do is so important to them. And what better outlet to relate what she learns from her ability to immerse herself than in a book?
But why does Picoult write fiction about such controversial issues when she could write nonfiction to give her readers the cold, hard facts about a topic she has researched? Certainly, nonfiction wouldn’t mesh the facts with fiction by its very nature. Picoult explained as she finished her lecture:
“There’s something that fiction can do that nonfiction cannot,” Picoult said. “A lot people will not address a controversial subject in nonfiction, but they pick up a novel, and they think they’re being entertained, and almost by accident, by the time they close that last page, they realize they are being forced to re-evaluate whatever opinions they have when they started the book.... Where I believe that nonfiction has the obligation to chronicle the past and what has happened, fiction has the opportunity to change minds, change the future, and change the course of what will happen.”
Here, here.

There’s an old saying that when you assume, you make a donkey out of you and me. However, there is one assumption that is probably very safe to make, and that is that every child, and thus every adult, loves the movie Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. While there are a number of reasons the film has a special place in all of our hearts — from the colorful candy room, to Gene Wilder’s iconic performance — the music is certainly a key ingredient. Who hasn’t skipped across the Cut after a successful exam, gleefully humming “I’ve got a golden ticket! I’ve got a golden twinkle in my eye!”? The songs are all happy and bright, and are inexorably linked to a period of innocence and comfort in our lives. They’re so beloved, in fact, that it’s hard to imagine any of those tunes eliciting an emotion other than happiness in a listener. Well, guess what? Thanks to American experimental rock group Primus, some of them may now give you nightmares.
Last Tuesday, Primus — known for being extremely weird — made one of the weirdest moves of their incredibly weird career, and released an album that covered the entire soundtrack to the 1971 family classic. The project, which is an extension of a specialty New Years Eve concert the group performed last year, reimagines the songs in Primus’s unique style, with varying degrees of success. Basically, they make every song sound as creepy as the part in the movie where they’re all in the boat in the dark tunnel, which is an incredibly intriguing, but repulsive concept.
Primus, for lack of a better description, sounds like a rickshaw gypsy band. Their sound is almost indescribable. It’s so unique, and the fact that they have taken on such a project is so undoubtedly them. Only Primus would think to cover the Willy Wonka soundtrack, and they’re probably the only artists weird enough to conceivably pull it off. The album takes multiple listens to sink in, because, at first, it’s so jarring. Creative force Les Claypool, who plays the upright bass and sings vocals in the band and is also well known for penning the South Park theme song, takes each song and makes them sound as if they’re being howled from a dark cavern.
“Candy Man” takes on a sinister snarl, placing the jolly tune in more of a “Goosebumps” vibe than the family-friendly classic initially conjures. The pounding drums in the chorus will match your heartbeat, and when the singer lets “He makes the world taste pretty dang good” slip through his lips, your skin will undoubtedly crawl. Braying guitars laid over thumping drums and other discordant instruments heighten the feeling of dread that permeates the song.
“Golden Ticket” starts off quiet and menacing, before exploding into a triumphant and pounding chorus. Les dances around on the bassline as Larry makes interesting sounds with his guitar. The whole group sounds like they’re having a lot of fun on this one. This song in particular sounds as if it may have been the genesis for the entire project; Primus’s unique sound fits so well with the song’s sing-song rhythm and overall gleeful and child-like atmosphere.
The group’s sound dynamic shines no brighter than on the “Oompa Loompa” tracks. These are songs that perfectly fit Primus; sound, attitude, and all. The bouncing bass lines of the dancing Oompa Loompas give the group a great platform from which to experiment.
The album’s absolute highlight and climax comes in Veruca Salt’s ode to greed, “I Want It Now.” The song’s register works well for the vocals, and it is probably the closest the group comes to a complete and successful rework of the song.
The group never expands beyond the bass, guitar, drums, marimba, and cello. It’s rather amazing the diversity of sounds they are able to produce and how rich the album sounds given the limited resources. These are clearly incredibly talented musicians who have found their niche and are digging as deep as possible into it.
The songs both repel and attract at the same time. They don’t necessarily sound good, but there’s something about them — some charm — that hooks you in and doesn’t let you go. Perhaps it’s because these are songs you’ve grown up with, known and loved your entire life, and to hear them performed in such a bizarre and interesting way is so shocking that you simply can’t get enough. It’s so hard to imagine “Pure Imagination” sounding like this, that when you do hear it, you’re instantly intrigued.
If “Semi-Wondrous Boat Ride” scared you as a kid, give this version a listen. I dare you.

Although it has officially been fall for a while now, temperatures have not dropped until recently, and the time to transition our wardrobes from summer clothes to items more suitable for colder weather is now quickly approaching.
At the same time, it is frustrating to leave your house in the morning wearing a sweater, fully prepared to brave the cold, only for the weather to suddenly become warmer in the middle of the day. As a result, the transition period between fall and winter that generally occurs from October through November can be difficult to handle. However, being aware of what’s in style this fall can really help. How do you figure out what’s in style, you ask? Most of the stuff seen on runways isn’t really wearable in a practical sense. What’s important is knowing how to translate those styles into your wardrobe to make them your own.
In Vogue Paris’ article, “20 trends for Fall/Winter 2014–2015,” the runways were full of clothing inspired by styles of the ’60s, including trapeze dresses and pastel colors, which is especially surprising considering the season. Try this style out with a trapeze or babydoll-fit dress. A personal favorite is the “Free People Sundown Babydoll Dress.” Although the dress is quite summery, it can still be worn in the fall with a pair of simple black tights, short heeled boots, and a cardigan. As simple as putting together this outfit is, it gives off the appearance that you put a lot of effort into pairing the pieces and are keeping up with trends. If you really feel like going all out that day, add a simple necklace to tie everything together.
Another one of Vogue’s 20 mentioned trends is described as “all over knits,” and that’s the only way to describe it. Pictures featuring clothing by Marc Jacobs and Céline show models dressed head-to-toe in the same color and texture of knit, meaning that they’re wearing sweater pants to match the sweater that they’re wearing. Sweaters are a normal thing to wear, but the sweater pants look a little crazy. Luckily, there’s another option that you can take which still follows the same theme, but looks more normal. Stores such as Modcloth and Free People have recently been featuring what they’ve been calling “sweater leggings,” which sound strange but actually look really cool. The leggings I found on Modcloth’s website have a Fair Isle design, while the ones at Free People are available in a variety of designs, including floral print. Pair them with a neutral colored sweater, and maybe a green anorak jacket (which has been in style since last fall), and short black boots.
Yet another one of the trends mentioned by Vogue was “eccentric furs,” which I not only found entertaining but also saw as a potential source of fashion inspiration. While I’m not asking you to wear the black and white fur coat seen at Alexander McQueen’s show (it’s pretty scary; you should look it up), this look is commonly reinterpreted with a fur vest. This trend is something I wouldn’t incorporate into my wardrobe on a daily basis, but it might be nice for events for which you need to look a little nicer or slightly trendier. Just throw one of these on over a simple neutral-toned sweater, dark-wash jeans, and tall boots or short heeled booties.
Ponchos made a comeback this fall as well, which is interesting since the last time I remember them being in style was when I was in the fifth grade. They can be tough to pull off, and you’d definitely have to go all out with the bohemian look if you’re going to try wearing a poncho. As a result, I would check Free People for some great bohemian ponchos. Though it’s on the pricy side, my favorite one is the “Starlight Shadow Poncho Cardi.” As its name suggests, this item of clothing is half-sweater, half-poncho. Pair it with a pair of simple black leggings and short brown boots.
Taking trends you see on the runway and making them your own is a great way to get inspired when choosing your wardrobe for the cooling fall weather. Generally, wear one of these statement pieces with other simple pieces. Doing this also makes it easier for you; if you want to try one or more of these trends, you won’t have to splurge on buying things that match it since most likely you have those items already.

In April 1945, the last month of World War II in the European Theatre, the Nazis make a last-ditch effort to uphold their resistance against the Allied troops marching into Germany. As a fictional account, Fury is a gritty and visceral depiction of the horrors of war that minimizes the glamour and overt chauvinism that most war movies tend to amplify. At least, it minimizes at much as it can — come on, Brad Pitt stars as the film’s heroic Sergeant Don “Wardaddy” Collier. Star power aside, Fury fearlessly displays the damage of the battlefield as being more tragic than it is heroic. Writer and director David Ayer (Training Day, End of Watch) is a master of the craft of filmmaking. He possesses and builds upon the power of making the audience feel the essence of a story. In this case, the essence lies in the internal devastation that the soldiers feel in every moment of the war, although they must quash their emotions in order to continue doing their job.
The film has a bevy of strong actors who play distinct characters inevitably torn down to shreds of who they once were. Wardaddy is the head of his regiment, and serves as the commander of his army tank, Fury. He’s strong-headed and tough, always determined to move onto the next mission. He commandeers a five-man crew that’s been with him since their North Africa Campaign: Boyd “Bible” Swan (Shia LaBeouf), a gunner who finds peace in Christianity; Trini “Gordo” Garcia (Michael Peña) a likable tank driver with a somewhat cheerful personality; and Grady “Coon-Ass” Travis (Jon Bernthal), a loader with a primal anger constantly lurking and ready to snap.
The crew has a synergistic bond that operates to a furiously mechanical rhythm. However, the crew is thrown off beat when they lose their second tank driver, and newcomer Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) is thrown into the regiment to take his place. Norman is the baby-faced, doe-eyed reluctant soldier who was originally a clerk trained to type 60 words a minute, not operate a 30-ton army tank. His empathy and reluctance to kill Nazis seriously irritate Wardaddy and the rest of the group, as they know that this is a serious impediment to their mission. They heckle him and mentally toss him into the trenches in order to prepare Norman for the ugly horror to come.
There’s a stubborn mentality that develops amongst these soldiers that can only come from the devastation of war. The soldiers are gritty: covered in dirt with desperate fatigue dragging onto their faces. It’s the mask they bear to face the war and, therefore, the only mask they feel they can handle in their lives anymore. It’s their grasp of manliness. There’s a scene in which Wardaddy and Norman intrude upon the home of two German women, and Wardaddy finally gets to have a clean shave. He dons off his shirt for a seemingly objectifying purpose, as the camera seems to take its time staying on his body, in all of Brad Pitt’s age-defying muscly glory. However, in the turn of a frame, the scars of war are revealed in the form of burn scars covering his back.
The war is forever embedded in their lives, superficially hidden under thinly sheathed surfaces. But it isn’t a 
truth that the rest of the soldiers have fully processed yet. Again, they identify with the trauma of war with more apparent evidence, like the mask of war that they don on their faces. When Wardaddy puts on a crisply clean shirt and now has a freshly washed face, he can be human again. He isn’t Wardaddy in this moment; he’s back to Don Collier. He eats lunch peacefully with his German hosts and with Norman — his respite from the everyday horror that clings to him. His crew bursts in on their lunch, insulted that Wardaddy didn’t invite them, but probably more so that his first real re-entrance into civility is with the enemy. They taunt him and the German women mercilessly and, for the first time, Wardaddy has no control over his soldiers because he’s in the bubble of civility and they’re still trapped in the realm of war. The scene goes to show that a civilian who hasn’t shared their journey can never fully understand the complexity of pain and horror from the battlefield.
It’s been nearly 70 years since World War II has ended and our memories of it have expanded into many branches of legacy. Fury climbs onto the branch that’s serves as the most honest and, hence, the most brutal. It isn’t so much a war film as it is a horror film, where people are so far displaced from their usual lives and are forced to deal with the hopelessness of such displacement. But through the desolation, the film invokes honor and humanity that can’t be found anywhere else.

On Saturday, in my eternal quest to eat at every restaurant worth eating at in Pittsburgh, I ventured off the beaten path to Cafe Zinho, a small, quirky Shadyside restaurant.
On a small side street off of Ellsworth Avenue, Cafe Zinho is about as hipster as Pittsburgh Mediterranean cafés come: it doesn’t take credit cards, it’s BYOB, and it’s totally underrated.
Walking into the cafe feels like walking into the place where bohemianism was born: the chandeliers are colorful splashes of glass, the cash register looks like it dates back to the days of Bonnie and Clyde, and the walls are decked out with the weirdest, coolest, most grandma-became-a-hipster decorations I’ve ever seen. The atmosphere, quiet before 6:30 p.m., is intimate and energetic, which pairs perfectly with the food. However, I was disappointed to be seated not only right inside the door but also right beside the counter at which the hosts and waiters seemed to gather, making it feel like our dinner was being monitored by the restaurant staff.
In any other case, this would have prevented me from discussing my food aloud, but the food at Cafe Zinho was so satisfyingly delicious that there was nothing I had to worry about saying too loudly.
Like many others, the restaurant drops bread on the table. Instead of the tired French loaf, it’s a warm, crisp on the outside, soft on the inside cornbread — a perfectly quirky start to your meal. I was afraid that the Mediterranean platter appetizer would be cliché and played out: some pita, hummus, olives, tomatoes, red peppers, and cheese do not make a five-star plate. 
However, my worries were unnecessary. Everything was seasoned so expertly that I felt that this dish was the best of its kind and a generous serving to boot.
For my dinner, I selected the only vegetarian option on the menu: the butternut squash ravioli with pumpkin coulis. (I must add that it was both a let-down and a surprise that this was my only option, especially at such a seemingly ‘hip’ restaurant where I would expect many vegetarians to dine.) When our waitress set my bowl down in front of me, I was sad to see such a small serving size. However, after several of these raviolis, I understood the thought behind the modest servings. The ravioli were incredibly filling, and by far the most autumnally appropriate dish I’ve had this fall. The butternut squash filling was light and sweet, with a hint of mint to finish them. They were perfectly paired with the pumpkin coulis, which was lightly spiced with cumin, ginger, garlic, and a little something else to make a pleasing marriage of sweet and spicy. The roasted vegetables that came with the dish seemed random but actually proved a nice addition. It gave the chance to taste the sauce on its own with something less flavorful.
The dessert was a beautiful, again modestly-sized, Portugese cornbread pudding. I was afraid that the dish would be too savory and overload the meal, but I was wrong again. In fact, the beautifully moist pudding was very sweet, and I was thankful that the sauce that came with it was creamy enough to mute the sugar a bit.
Everything was perfectly presented, and it is easy to see that the staff here truly cares about the food that they are serving, and the experience that the diners have. My biggest complaint was that for such modest servings, the prices were very high. The quality of the food was absolutely amazing, but even small portions of amazing shouldn’t cost $25 to $30. I wish the prices were more reasonable so I could justify eating that delicious ravioli again.
It’s easy to walk past Cafe Zinho, tucked away in a small house on Spahr Street, but this is one ex-garage that you want to make sure to try at least once.
Cafe Zinho is located at 238 Spahr Street in Shadyside. It is cash only and BYOB.

Deliver Us From Evil
Friday, Oct. 31
7,9:30,12
Halloween: the only time of the year I find watching horror movies acceptable. If you watch them all year round, I question your taste in movies. Sorry. But, not really. Anyway, come down to McConomy Auditorium and watch Deliver Us From Evil instead of going trolling for candy — you’re in college now. The movie features Eric Bana as rough-and-tumble NYPD sergeant Ralph Sarchie, and Joel McHale as his high-octane partner, Butler. Together they are unstoppable and completely cliché. As if that weren’t enough, enter hard-drinking and perpetually smoking Catholic priest Joe Mendoza. This is just the inner dialogue that I imagine happened. Guy #1: I want to make a horror movie with two cops. Guy #2: Okay, but we have a lot of those. Throw in a Catholic Priest and we have a deal. Guy #1: Deal. They hug and become best friends forever. Without giving away any plot — but come on, you probably already know what happens — this movie includes religion, exorcisms, demons, post-traumatic stress disorder, and bad New York accents. It also includes an example of Hollywood ageism at it’s finest: Olivia Munn plays Sarchie’s wife Jen (that’s a 12-year age difference).
The Wolverine
Saturday, Nov. 1 — 8, 11
Sunday, Nov. 2 — 8
Some may say Australia is most known for kangaroos, koalas, and Vegemite, but I say it’s Hugh Jackman. Seriously, they should put him on the flag. This is Jackman’s sixth appearance as Wolverine/Logan, first arriving on the big screen in 2000’s X-Men — and luckily, this movie makes up for the atrocity that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. It starts out with Logan traveling to Japan to meet with the scientist that made him “The Wolverine.” He offers to take away his knuckle swords because that is what Logan has always wanted. But — spoiler — he doesn’t go through because, one, Logan realizes he will always be Wolverine, and two, Hollywood loves sequels. The following action scenes are pretty awesome as well. Keep your eyes out for the fighting sequence on top of the moving train. From the trailer, the movie looks very cheesy, but it is actually quite engrossing.

Dear Evan,
I only ever eat at McDonald’s during its Monopoly-themed promotion season. I know, it’s pretty shameful, but I’m not a hardcore McDonald’s Monopoly player: I don’t collect the colored stamps (streets like Park Place, Utilities, Railroads, etc.), which, while they’re pretty difficult to get, yield awesome prizes (gas from Shell for a year!). I harden my stomach and eat there for the immediate prizes — but this year, I won a one-month subscription for Hulu Plus, and I have no idea what to do with it. I can watch all the shows I want for free somewhere else, so why should I take the time to put in some code to get free TV for a month, then have to endure endless emails from Hulu pleading to have me back?
Grumpily,
Pretty Rattled by Operose Jape, was Expecting Chocolate Truffles or Free Rectal Exams, Even TJ’s Vouchers
Dear PROJECT FREE TV,
You can just unsubscribe from the emails. There should be a link at the bottom of … yes, there it is. Good job. Gold star.
I’m sure there are many rational ethical, moral, and economic reasons to pay for your television — should we even call it television anymore? — but I’m pretty sure most people under 25 are perfectly fine with enjoying whatever shows they want, whenever they want, free of charge. Setting up a Netflix (or Amazon Prime, or Hulu Plus, or whatever) account sounds like a pretty good 25th birthday present to yourself.
I’m looking at the McDonald’s Monopoly prizes webpage here, and it looks like soon-to-be-obsolete companies are trying to achieve a semblance of relevance with this contest. Remember Shutterfly? Maybe not? You could’ve gotten a free mug, magnet, or 8x8 photo book from them (with whose photos inside?). And I thought Redbox went out of business!
It’s unsurprising you’re nonplussed with the prizes, considering that upper-middle-class Carnegie Mellon students — assuming you are one, which is a safe assumption — lie outside of the McDonald’s prime demographic (think older and below the United States’ proverbial belt). But hey, at least this gets rid of your last reason to ever step foot inside a McDonald’s again.
Still upset Pittsburgh doesn’t have Panda Express,
Evan Kahn

On Wednesday, AB Concerts announced the booking for the fall concert. On Nov. 15, Walk the Moon with special guest PUBLIC, will perform in Wiegand Gymnasium. The indie rock band is primarily known for their catchy song “Anna Sun,” which reached the top 10 charts in 2012. A new single, “Shut Up and Dance,” and an accompanying music video were released on Oct. 23. According to radio.com, the band has long been on its way to becoming a “full-on pop and alt-rock explosion” and “If any song will catapult them there, it’s their recent single.” Walk the Moon is expected to release another album, titled Talking is Hard in December.
PUBLIC, the band that will accompany Walk the Moon, is a pop rock indie band based in Cincinnati. The band has toured with Walk the Moon, Neon Trees, and Twenty One Pilots, according to their website.
The AB Concerts co-chairs promoted the release by posting clues and hints on their Facebook page leading up to Wednesday’s announcement, which took place at the Fence with a giant banner and on the organization’s Facebook page.
“[To book a performer], we work with a middle agent, someone who manages communication between us and an agency. They provide us with a list of artists available at that time and within our budget, and then we offer a bid. Walk the Moon was actually our first choice,” said Samantha Landen, the AB Concerts co-chair and senior information systems and human-computer interaction double major.
Landen and her co-chair, junior information systems major Jenny Yang, are excited for the concert, saying that they have gotten a lot of positive feedback from the student body.
Sarah Duncan, a sophomore logic and computation major is one such excited student. “I think it’s fantastic. I’m really excited that they booked a great band that lots of people are into. It’s a band that is well-known enough that there’s a following at CMU of people who listen regularly. But people are still excited to see them because not a ton of people have seen them already,” Duncan said.
“This worked out really well for us,” Yang said. “I’m a big fan.”
Landen shares Yang’s excitement, saying that she has heard that it’s a fun show and that students who have already seen them are excited to see them again. The two have been involved in AB since their first years here, and started working with smaller venues, such as the Underground and Skibo.
“I’ve loved planning events and meeting the artists. I’m a concert junkie, so it’s perfect,” Yang said.
Landen said that this position is just as rewarding, but on a larger scale. “It’s really fun, because you get to reach such a wide audience with these events,” Landen said.
Students will be able to acquire tickets two weeks in advance of the show at the Information Desk, as per usual. They will be free with a valid Carnegie Mellon student ID.
The show will begin at 7 p.m., and more information will be released on the AB Concerts Facebook page.

Weeks after the Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC) and the Employment Opportunities Conference (EOC), students checked in outside of Rangos Auditorium for a different kind of career fair. Spark, which took place last Thursday and held its first career fair four years ago, is meant specifically for smaller companies and startups, and caters to students who are interested in working for such companies.
One of the appeals of Spark, Assistant Director at the Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC), and one of the organizers of the event Ray Mizgorski said, is that Spark costs less for companies to attend than the TOC or EOC.
Spark also offers a more intimate atmosphere for students and recruiters. According to Associate Dean for the CPDC Kevin Monahan, over 300 companies and 3,000 students attended the TOC across all three days, while only 32 companies and about 300 students attended Spark.
Recruiters at Spark, Mizgorski said, are looking for students across majors. “It’s really nice because we don’t say startups in tech, or startups in this, or that. It really cuts across all disciplines,” he said.
The companies are also not limited to California’s Bay Area, known as the traditional home of startup culture. “Some of [the companies] are in Pittsburgh, some of them are in Chicago or the Midwest, a good handful or so are coming from the West Coast. So it really is expanding.”
Lucky Ramsey, director of recruitment for Waypaver, said that she appreciated the open dialogue that she could have with students at Spark. Waypaver, which Ramsey described as “the internal recruiting arm for a venture capital company,” is based in Chattanooga, Tenn., and was looking for computer scientists and product designers at Spark.
“[The fair is] really good because the students have a certain expectation,” Ramsey said. “Because they want to work for a startup, and they’re ready for it. Some students at larger job fairs are just like ‘Oh, startups, nothing to see here.’”
Kevin Collins, senior assistant director for the CPDC and another organizer of Spark, also noted that startups get lost in the crowd at larger job fairs. 
“Startups and smaller companies, at a lot of different events, feel like they get lost between the larger companies,” Collins said. “So this is really a very informal, intimate setting, so they can talk to students. It’s a lot less crowded; there’s more room for dialogue.”
Some Carnegie Mellon students are looking specifically for internships at startups. 
Rucha Patil, a master’s student in Heinz College’s School of Information Systems and Management, said that, although she went to the TOC, she is specifically looking to work for a startup. “I would love to work with one of these companies,” Patil said.
Mizgorski also emphasized how valuable it can be to work or intern at a startup. “The experiences that the students can get for internships [at startups] can be priceless,” Mizgorski said, “because typically in a smaller company you’re asked to do a lot more. 
It’s not like a typical corporate situation where you’re stuck doing one thing all summer.”
Spark included more established companies like Pinterest, as well as companies like Branding Brand, a mobile commerce company founded by three Carnegie Mellon alumni in 2008, and Leanplum, an optimization solution for mobile apps founded in 2012.
Spark, Mizgorski said, aligns with Carnegie Mellon’s ever-growing entrepreneurial spirit. “With the entrepreneurial spirit that the students have here they always sought out startups, either companies that they started themselves or ones that other students were starting,” he said. “So we realized that was a definite niche that needed to be addressed.”

Carnegie Mellon has protocols in place in the unlikely event that a case of Ebola is identified on campus, according to Director of University Health Services (UHS) Anita Barkin. On Wednesday, Barkin emailed the campus community to provide updates about actions the university is taking against Ebola.
In the email, Barkin said that the university is working with local health care agencies, which primarily include the Allegheny County Health Department and UPMC Emergency Medicine, and is following guidelines provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to prevent the spread of Ebola should a case appear. Health Services has also been in conversation with the University of Pittsburgh Student Health Service.
Barkin said that the university has not had to screen any members of the campus community thus far. Additionally, the university has not received any calls from campus community members returning from affected areas such as Liberia, Guinea, or Sierra Leone, although the university has received calls from individuals asking about precautions prior to travelling to places not in West Africa.
“One of the questions I ask ... international travelers is whether they’ve gotten a flu shot,” Barkin said. “Because your chances of getting the flu are a lot greater than coming into contact with Ebola, and more people die of the flu every year than of Ebola.”
The university also has an Emergency Response Plan with a planning team that reviews and updates the plan. This team includes members from across various campus bodies, such as members of Student Affairs, Facilities Management Services, University Police, and Environmental Health and Safety, among others. In light of the Ebola outbreak, the team revised the emergency protocol for responding to infectious diseases. Barkin said that Linda Gentile, the director of the Office of International Education at Carnegie Mellon, was involved in discussion related to Ebola. Michael Murphy, the vice president of campus affairs, leads the emergency planning team as the Executive Policy representative.
CMU EMS and University Police are trained to screen students in the case that they must respond to a possible case of Ebola, according to Barkin. They are trained to first ask “Do you have a fever?” and, if given a response of “yes,” they ask “Have you traveled to West Africa or been exposed to anyone who has traveled to West Africa and is ill?” If given another response of “yes,” the members summon the 9-1-1 dispatcher.
University staff were trained by Environmental Health and Safety on how to correctly use personal protective equipment, consisting of a waterproof gown, foot coverings, gloves, and a face shield, according to Barkin. The university secured equipment for health services, as well as CMU EMS in the “very unusual circumstance where they would be in a situation where they would need [the equipment],” Barkin said.
Nurses and clinical staff at the university were trained to triage Ebola cases and secure a space where a suspected case is treated, and to disinfect that space before resuming public use.
“The chances of our having to deal with that situation are pretty low,” Barkin said of the possibility of an Ebola case at Carnegie Mellon. “Here [at] Carnegie Mellon we’ve been really smart about this. We were on it in August, already thinking about this before students arrived.”
The recent email update to the campus community states that members are expected to call UHS before returning to campus after visiting places affected by the virus. Members are then expected to monitor themselves for up to 21 days after their return.
Barkin first emailed the campus community about the university’s response to Ebola on Aug. 8, after two U.S. citizens were transferred from Liberia to Atlanta’s Emory University Hospital earlier in the month. The ninth person to be treated for Ebola in the United States was diagosed on Oct. 23 in New York City when doctor Craig Spencer reported symptoms a week after returning from Guinea.
The virus, which was first discovered in 1976, is known to only spread through direct contact with blood or bodily fluids of individuals already exhibiting symptoms.

Carnegie Mellon English professors Jim Daniels and Andreea Ritivoi on Friday gave a joint reading from their recently published works, Eight Mile High and Intimate Strangers: Arendt, Marcuse, Solzhenitsyn, and Said in American Political Discourse, respectively, in the university bookstore.
Daniels, who is a professor of creative writing at Carnegie Mellon, began the event with a reading from his new book of fiction. Eight Mile High is comprised of linked short stories written in a flash fiction format — often referred to as “prose poems” — meaning they are relatively short and use lyrical language. The book’s stories center around characters living near the famed Eight Mile road in Detroit, which is both a physical and symbolic borderline between the predominantly white and working class suburbs and the African-American urban center.
Daniels chose to read a story that comes at the end of the book, titled “The Tall Tale and Cowboy Mattress,” which focuses on a main character of the book, whom it follows from childhood. In the story, the character reflects on his own child, who is grown and attending the fictitious Eight Mile High from which the book draws its title. The piece’s narrator focuses on a mattress spotted with images of cowboys and recalls both his son’s and his own happy period of innocence.
Andreea Ritivoi, who is a professor of rhetoric focusing on narrative and identity among other subjects, followed with a reading from her book, Intimate Strangers. She introduced the selection by explaining the Leo Tolstoy short story “Kholstomer,” which tells a typical love story between a farmer and his wife, but is told from the perspective of their horse. In this manner, everything the reader sees is filtered through the horse’s perspective, with the goal of making normal things take on a new shine. For example, the horse refers to everything, whether it be the farm or the farmer, as “his,” which goes against a normal human view of property ownership in a farm environment.
Ritivoi explained that this technique is known as “defamiliarization,” and Tolstoy uses it to allow the reader to re-examine the most basic aspects of life. Ritivoi went on to explain that she sees foreigners, whom she defined as anyone identified by Americans as foreigners, as key agents of defamiliariaztion in the American political discussion, a role they are often scrutinized for. 
The four subjects of Intimate Strangers — Hannah Arendt, Herbert Marcuse, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and Edward Said — were all foreigners with varying degrees of legal citizenship, but all came under great attack for criticizing the American political system. Ritivoi explained that all of her subjects were extremely vilified, with some even receiving death threats, for having the gall to criticize America as a foreigner; even though individuals considered to be “native” Americans echoed their criticisms.
Through a study of their writings, Ritivoi dissected the rhetorical voice of the foreigner and how to establish the concept of defamiliariaztion through careful use of language, and concluded that the voice of a foreigner could be adopted in writing to give a unique perspective on issues.
Attendance was sparse, consisting mainly of the professors’ students and colleagues. Those in attendance responded warmly to the reading, especially given their departmental connection to the two professors. Fifth year scholar and professional writing and creative writing double major Josh Claudio said, “It’s cool seeing Jim outside of an academic environment and speaking on things that personally interest him.”
After Ritivoi concluded her segment, Daniels made a point that the two works are not quite as different as they appear. Daniels explained that within Detroit, which has become somewhat of the poster child of a failed America, one must “earn the right to criticize Detroit by being from there.” He spoke of a team of French photographers who photographed the ruins and abandoned buildings of Detroit, and how the citizens felt violated and exploited. 
Daniels said, however, that if the same photos had been run in a local newspaper, there would likely have been little to no controversy. “Who has the authority to criticize?” was thus a central theme of the afternoon.

Society has long fixated on stars and celebrities — ordinary people who become cultural icons, whether by talent or by sheer infamy.
But David Shumway, a Carnegie Mellon professor of English and literary and cultural studies, wants to know, What is stardom? What makes a “star,” and how do individuals attain star status?
Shumway addressed these questions in his talk “Rock Star and Listening,” delivered on Thursday in the Adamson Wing of Baker Hall. “How did we get from Cary Grant to Mick Jagger?” he asked. “How is it that popular music went from ... something that people considered trivial, light entertainment ... to central to cultural identity?”
Shumway offered a summary of his book Rock Star: The Making of Musical Icons from Elvis to Springsteen, which examines the concept of the “rock star” — its origins, its defining qualities, and its impact on music listening over the past century.
According to Shumway, the original rock star equivalents were movie stars like Humphrey Bogart and Cary Grant — actors who adopted culturally iconic personas in their work, “distinct packages of attractive traits that might inspire imitation.”
Their legacies gave way to more politicized stars like John Wayne, Marilyn Monroe, and James Dean and ultimately to Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, and James Brown, who became increasingly influential and transformed the way people experience music.
Unlike celebrity, defined as “someone who is known for their well-knownness,” stardom requires skill and talent. “All stars are celebrities, but not all celebrities are stars,” Shumway explained.
Stardom requires some level of attractiveness, Shumway said: People “want to either have the star or be the star.” The star’s persona must transcend the individual, existing symbolically or iconically in the public’s imagining. In this way, the persona is not only accessible, but to a degree attainable by ordinary people. Shumway focused his talk on three 20th-century rock stars. Elvis Presley is described by Shumway as a blend of rebelliousness and vulnerability. 
Presley’s accessibility on network TV meant that “fun could be experienced in living rooms of most American homes,” and as a cultural icon he challenged a number of social norms: paying homage to African American music, performing as a working-class man, and “bumping and grinding” against gender norms that prescribed that only women display their bodies as sexual objects.
Presley’s stardom gave way to Bob Dylan, initially a protest songwriter who gained attention as a full rock-’n’-roll musician with hit single “Like a Rolling Stone.” 
Dylan embodied “the individual freedom of the bohemian,” styling himself as a societal outsider. Later, “godfather of soul” James Brown came to fame as a traditional American success story, overcoming poverty and race barriers to attain stardom and using his status to influence politics and cultural trends.
Due to time constraints, Shumway cut his summary short, offering brief overviews of influential stars Joni Mitchell, who represented a shift to the personal songwriter, and Bruce Springsteen, who continued Dylan’s legacy as a politically engaged musician and hoped for a transformation in American government.
Shumway described the phenomenon of “listening through rock stardom,” when consumers of music feel an emotional connection to any recording by a particular star: Songs become significant because a star produced it, not because of any stand-alone musical merit. 
Although we still see this phenomenon today, Shumway argues that stardom is necessarily dwindling: Stars simply don’t have the same reach they did decades ago.
Shumway concluded with his assessment of the decline of rock stardom in recent years. 
According to Shumway, we have entered an era of “distracted listening,” characterized by ubiquitous music and listening while multitasking, in contrast to a previous time when music listening was an absorbing, attention-consuming experience. 
In this way, Shumway argued, popular music is becoming essentially trivial, just as it was before the era of rock stardom.

Fiscal policy presentation
Junior economics and decision science double major Landon He gave a presentation regarding changes to Student Senate fiscal policies, beginning with a discussion of reevaluating Senate funding for unrecognized student organizations. 
Roughly 25 percent of allocations made over the past six years have been to unrecognized organizations, many of whom do not have the luxury of previous budgeting. The impact of an event or an initiative which could be funded is evaluated with respect to the breadth of its impact, its administration, and its value to students. It was concluded that the events which are funded should align with Senate’s funding philosophy, the language of which is to be clarified by these changes. 
Some of the issues discussed were that there is no clause prohibiting funding for individuals, that special allocation funds are permitted to fund the operational costs of initiatives that donate any portion of their proceeds to charity, and that events that are purposed for a specific group or major would be discriminatory.
Upcoming Senate events
Senate will hold a vacancy election in the coming week, and will address the topics of the Healthy U survey and financial allocations. Additionally, bylaw changes will be presented for discussion and voting on Nov. 2.

On Oct. 18, the Catholic church ended its assembly of bishops in Vatican City with results that proved underwhelming after the optimistic interim report. 
This assembly, known as The Synod of Bishops on the Family, was called one year ago by Pope Francis with the intent to broaden the accepted idea of family. This gathering, however, only reaffirmed the archaic attitude toward homosexuality and non-traditional families, which an unfortunate majority of conservative church leaders maintain.
Almost a week prior to the meeting’s adjournment, a statement had been released consisting of a draft of the language contained in the final report. This draft, while qualifying that same-sex unions cannot be valued the same as marriage between a man and a woman, openly discussed the positives in same-sex relationships and the need for parishes to accept them, as well as their children. There was mention of the current inefficiency in the annulment process and encouragement for divorced people to receive Holy Communion.
Also contained in the mid-assembly release was the acceptance of common-law marriage in the face of poverty or in other parts of the world where matrimony is considered lavish. This draft gave the impression that the Catholic church was taking action on many modern issues faced by marginalized groups, and in a positive direction. The final report, however, did not affirm such hopes.
Any mention of same-sex relationships, divorced people, or common-law marriage was removed from the final document. The vote of almost 200 bishops present fell short of the required two-thirds majority, and the entire section would have gone unmentioned had Pope Francis not insisted it be discussed in preparation for the next Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015.
It seems, at this point, the only hope of these progressive social ideas being accepted in the church falls on the Pope’s shoulders, especially since bishops from within the assembly have publicly stated that nowhere can same-sex unions be considered equal to heterosexual matrimony. This is a dark note to close the discussion on.
While many liberal Catholics have placed their hopes for a more accepting church in the current Pope, there is still much being said in opposition to the modernizations the church needs, and still refuses, to take a stance on. 
It is disheartening that even with mounting pressure from faithful members and leaders, the Catholic church is constantly qualifying and backtracking any definitive statements intended for the entirety of its followers, despite Pope Francis making his opinions plainly clear since his appointment. 
There is still hope that progress can be made in next year’s assembly with an even larger congregation in attendance, but few positives can be found in the wavering indecision of the largest and one of the most powerful religions in the world.

At the start of October, the state-owned power company of Saskatchewan, Canada, began operating a new state-of-the-art power plant. It’s the first of its kind: a coal burning plant that manages to drastically cut its CO2 emissions by capturing up to 90 percent of the greenhouse gas produced, then pumping it deep underground, below what geologists assure is a nonpermeable layer of stone.
I believe them, although I’m sure that, as this technology is used on more and more plants, we’ll see failures on occasion, and fixing them will prove costly. Plus, the sequestration technology is being touted as equivalent to taking 250,000 cars off the road, which is something I have no complaints with. However, what I do have a problem with is the fact that this plant will still be adding 27,777 cars to the road with just the 10 percent of CO2 that will be escaping into the atmosphere.
In the meantime, all of the other coal- and fossil fuel-fired plants currently in use are releasing more than their fair share of CO2 (not to mention toxic radioactive ash). There are ways to clean up the fossil fuel-based power generation and, as retrofits to existing plants, sequestration technology is a worthwhile pursuit. But it’s like switching from cigars to filtered cigarettes: At the end of the day, you’re still addicted to something that is actively harming you.
The companies that stand to profit the most from our current global reliance on fossil fuels are attempting to do what tobacco companies did in the 1950s and ’60s, when the scientific evidence proving the link between cancer and cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and chewing tobacco, became almost universally accepted. Those companies were able to use their massive pools of capital to slow the implementation of regulations to promote the health of the population, which had the side benefit of decreasing the environmentally-taxing cultivation of tobacco.
Then, as now, opposition came from politicians taking money from a powerful economic block. They were backed by right-wing commentators who valued the “personal” liberty of major corporations and their owners to make a profit at the expense of both individuals and the health of the greater public. The current capacity of right-wing pundits to deny, misinterpret, and outright lie about the overwhelming scientific data about climate change was alive and well then too.
Consider Ayn Rand, the intellectual godmother to the libertarian movement, and a habitual smoker. Rand decried the “anti-smoking lobby” her entire life, even after having a cancerous lung removed in 1974. The most prominent floral arrangement at her funeral was a 6-foot-tall dollar sign.
Oil companies and the right wing both continue to point to “clean coal” technologies and talk about the financial costs associated with developing and installing alternative energy sources, as well as the loss of jobs in the mining sector. They’re right that it won’t be a simple matter to move away from traditional fossil fuels: They’re relatively easy to get, and cheap compared to the alternatives.
Quitting smoking, like kicking the fossil fuel habit, isn’t easy. But despite the urgings of groups like Greenpeace, it doesn’t have to be cold turkey. Nuclear energy has the potential to be our Nicorette. It has its drawbacks in the form of long-lasting waste, but it’s comparatively easy to collect and control, and there’s a lot less of it to capture and store. Carbon sequestration solves one problem of fossil fuels, but produces another.
We need to accept the fact fossil fuels are a dangerous base for our society that might prove one day to be an existential threat. We’ve already had warning signs in the form of higher tides, bigger storms, and dryer droughts. As a society, we need to suck it up and kick the habit.

Besides the flyers asking you to join a research study or encouraging you to be a part of Greek life, have you noticed the number of flyers trying to promote awareness? Or have you noticed the chalking all over campus aimed at supporting good causes? 
Think about how many tables you walk by in front of Doherty Hall where students call you out and ask, “Do you want to help fight cancer?” We live in a society that is constantly promoting awareness. We live in a culture of ribbons. Is there anything wrong with that?
The classic pink breast cancer ribbon is very common in today’s culture. This is not surprising considering the fact that Susan G. Komen, the organization responsible for originating the symbol, has 105 corporate partners. Many of these corporate partners use the pink ribbon as a way of bringing in more consumers. Adding the pink ribbon to a company’s logo or slogan creates an attractive image for consumers who wish to support good causes. But is “pink-ribbon-ing” acceptable as a business?
I admit, when I see the pink ribbon, it makes me smile because it reminds me of the global efforts to fundraise for breast cancer research and awareness, a goal of the ribbon culture. The ribbon itself acts a reminder to people of the success that Susan G. Komen and similar organizations have achieved. When we see a sea of pink, making its way around the world, it is a giant step toward supporting those whose lives have been affected by breast cancer. The pink ribbon has become a universally-recognized symbol of hope and progress.
“Pink-ribbon-ing” is not tainting the message of Susan G. Komen and similar companies. Yes, it is an advantageous business strategy for companies, but it also lets us know that another helping hand is contributing to support breast cancer. This is simple collaboration.
If Susan G. Komen did not have many corporate partners, because it refused to allow “pink-ribbon-ing,” the organization would not have achieved the same level of success. Collaboration is a crucial means of advancing business interests, and it has proved to be one of the most effective methods of raising awareness.
Think about the number of Carnegie Mellon organizations that collaborate with each other to promote awareness of their goals. For example, a small service organization may decide to co-host an event with a larger, more prominent student organization. Even though they may not share the exact same goals, collaboration brings in more participants and helps all involved.
We live in a ribbon culture, where raising awareness is a significant step toward greater goals. Whether fundraising to build homes for refugees, collecting food for the hungry, or even sharing a cultural event with the entire campus, if the goal is to raise awareness, collaboration is an incredibly useful tool.

The Carnegie Mellon community received an email from President Subrah Suresh on Oct. 16 detailing the Carnegie Mellon Strategic Planning process. This is an initiative that includes examining how the university presents itself to the public and sets “the course for the university’s future in a changing global landscape.” 
The email presents a three-pronged approach, and announces upcoming efforts such as the national search for a Vice President of Marketing and Communications. Among these efforts is a partnership with global branding and communications firm Edelman to aid in the launch of the “Brand Development Project.”
As Suresh’s email emphasized, “the Brand Development project is not about changing our culture, creating new logos or launching advertising campaigns. Rather, it will be about taking our existing unique culture and strengths, and articulating them more powerfully and coherently to an increasingly global audience.”
The Brand Development Project is an important and necessary initiative at this juncture, especially considering that the school’s current logo is the three words, “Carnegie Mellon University.” The rhetoric surrounding messages about Carnegie Mellon’s brand are often populated with heavily used buzzwords such as “interdisciplinary” and “innovation” — ideals that are important to Carnegie Mellon’s identity, but are often left unaccompanied by substantive messages about who we are as a university.
The Tartan agrees that the branding process should not be a reassessment, but a revamping of existing values and messages about our community. Even further, The Tartan hopes that the rebranding effort will not only reiterate these values, but also pair them with substantive messages about the university.

Last week, Michael Dunn was sentenced to life in prison for the first-degree murder of Jordan Davis, an African American 17-year-old who was fired at ten times by Dunn for playing loud music in an SUV outside a Jacksonville, Fla. convenience store. The sentence follows Dunn’s initial February trial in which the jury hung, and may serve as a precedent in similar violent crimes which are clearly racially motivated.  
From Trayvon Martin to Michael Brown to countless less-publicized incidents, the United States has shown itself to be a country largely indifferent to justice for young black men — at least at the level of infrastructure, and surely in the hearts of millions of individuals. George Zimmerman was acquitted of all charges last year, and today he is a murderer who walks free. 
Meanwhile, the dust in Ferguson is hardly settled, even as mainstream media attention and public attention wane. Michael Brown’s killer, the white cop Darren Wilson, far from being convicted of a crime, has not been charged and is awaiting a grand jury decision on paid administrative leave. 
As militarized cops continue to beat down protestors, racists across America have raised over $200,000 in Wilson’s name online, apparently as a sort of extra reward for the murder of a black teenager. 
Dunn is the first high-profile case in recent memory that has closed in favor of the black victim. The ruling is especially encouraging considering Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” law, which has often been evoked in such cases, including Zimmerman’s. 
The Tartan can only hope that Dunn is the first in a new wave of justified convictions for the murder of young black men which has long been a contentious issue in this country. However, we know too well the short lifespan of the public’s anger over injustice. 
The public’s sympathies are limited, since to care deeply and continuously about any important, complicated issue is exhausting to the point of impossibility. Nevertheless, the next Jordan Davis will blast through the papers sooner or later. Detangling the threads of long-held racism in American society requires endurance.

In a world where millions of users’ information can be compromised in a matter of seconds, it is hard to believe that Americans still continue to stand by their half-century-old magnetic stripe cards. This outdated technology, in which users must reveal their full name, credit card payment number, and security code, as well as other sensitive information, has seen tens of millions of security compromises in the last year alone.
Target, the Home Depot, and most recently, Staples, have seen just how easy it is to have information compromised when they are essentially storing what is a goldmine of tens of millions of credit cards.
Apple Pay and other wireless NFC payment systems may finally be the solution to this issue. With Apple Pay, the retailer is presented with no personal information from the person on the other side of the payment; the only thing received on their end is a one-time payment code in order to carry out the transaction.
Apple Pay represents the innovation that credit card companies should have brought years ago. After testing Apple Pay at the Craig Street Subway, I can conclude that it is as simple and easy to use as advertised. One simply walks up to the register, points their phone at the payment device, and holds their fingerprint down for verification. It’s that simple. Perhaps the most exciting part about it is that while using it, the customer does not have to worry about who they are handing their credit card to and where the information is being stored.
Apply Pay has had a few glitches since its launch, such as Bank of America customers being double charged for some purchases, but with a technology this new, it may take a bit of time to wire out all of the glitches and issues. However, once perfected, removed of issues, and accepted at a wider range of retailers, Apple Pay has the opportunity to revolutionize the way people make purchases.
The potential for success associated with Apple Pay is due to the fact that Apple does not wish to be the middleman. None of the transaction activity from Apple Pay is stored on Apple’s servers, and Apple is taking a fee-free, hands-off approach to mobile payments. Its goal is not to profit off of single purchases; it is to sell more iDevices and become the new standard for mobile payments.
The most disappointing thing about Apple Pay is that PNC and many other major banks were not included with the initial release. While Apple Pay will support most banks and cards in the future, it only supports a handful at launch.
In addition, the speedy convenience of Apple Pay is entirely in the hands of the retailer. If the retailer spends thirty seconds telling you about their rewards card each time you make a purchase, the experience is ruined. Because of this, Apple should incorporate rewards and loyalty cards into its Passbook application and add a feature that automatically sends rewards information upon making a purchase. In addition, Apple should create an Apple Pay policy that retailers cannot ask about loyalty cards, but Passbook displays available loyalty cards to the user upon request.
Because of Apple’s success in getting support from all of the major banks and credit card companies, it has the potential to revolutionize the mobile payment market. Magnetic stripe cards are a completely outdated technology that put all users at risk. It is time that a major company like Apple comes along and sets a new standard for the way we pay. While only time will tell the success of Apple Pay, I will be surprised if a significant portion of Americans are still attached to their magnetic stripe cards in a decade.
