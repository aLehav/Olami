On Wednesday, March 22, Carnegie Mellon University announced the intention to add softball as the school’s newest intercollegiate sport. The softball team will begin competing in the University Athletic Association (UAA) in the 2019 season.
“The addition of softball as an intercollegiate sport is historic for our university, and I am grateful to our administration for making it a reality,” said Director of Athletics Josh Centor in a press release. “Our student-athletes have made a significant impact on the culture of Carnegie Mellon University, and it is a tribute to the Tartans of past and present for helping provide this opportunity for our program to expand.”
Softball will become the 19th varsity sport at Carnegie Mellon, and second intercollegiate program added in the past four years. The women’s golf team began intercollegiate play in Fall 2014, and has excelled in its first three seasons at the intercollegiate level. The women’s golf program is currently ranked 26th nationally.
“It is an exciting time to be at Carnegie Mellon as we build on our outstanding intercollegiate athletic program,” said Vice President of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno in the same release. “This expansion offers the opportunity to recruit a new profile of students who are eager to study at an institution of Carnegie Mellon’s caliber while bringing their talent and love for softball to the university experience.”
Student-athletes have made a significant impact on the university community, as they have excelled athletically and academically across rigorous disciplines. During the 2015-16 academic year, varsity athletes posted a cumulative QPA of 3.37, and 77 student-athletes had 4.0s during this past semester. Athletically, the program has made its mark on a national level, as each fall and winter program was represented in postseason competition this year.
“I am exceptionally proud of what our student-athletes accomplish in their sports and through their contributions to the life of the campus,” Casalegno said. “Adding softball to Carnegie Mellon expands that contribution and creates meaningful experiences for our students as they represent the university in a well-established softball program among our UAA peers.”
Carnegie Mellon will begin a national search for the first head coach of its softball program this spring. The 2017-18 academic year will be spent recruiting the first class of players.
“We believe we have the infrastructure in place that will allow us to be successful in softball at a national level,” Centor said. “We expect to be competitive quickly.”

Moore’s law has accurately predicted trends in computer transistors for decades. It demonstrates the accelerating progress and change of computer science and technology, and gives us a glimpse into our technological capabilities of tomorrow. What is Moore’s law, and will it be accurate forever?
Moore’s law states that the number of transistors per square inch on a computer circuit doubles every 18 months. It predicts that this current trend will continue on well into the unforeseeable future. It was introduced by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 in an article for Electronics magazine titled “Cramming more components onto integrated circuits.”
The law begins with a critical invention — the integrated circuit. Before then, computers amplified electronic signals using vacuum tubes, which were quite large and had the tendency to overheat and break down over time. These vacuum tubes made improvements to the power and efficiency of computers difficult. This prompted researchers at Bell Laboratories to search for alternative methods for controlling electric signals in a computer. Out of this drive for improvement came the semi-conductor.
The semi-conductor is a material, such as silicon, that can insulate and conduct electricity, depending on conditions it is placed under. Engineers started packing transistors onto silicon chips, spurring the computer revolution of the 1960s and 1970s.
Moore noticed that engineers managed to double the number of transistors on a single silicon chip almost every two years. With more computing power came faster, smaller computers that could fit on desks in the home.
Moore’s law is not a fundamental law in any way. It only holds true because of the actions of humans. What really keeps it true is market competition among computer chip manufacturers. These companies are aware that if they do not double the number of transistors on their chips every two years, their competitors will. To stay ahead, companies adhere strictly to Moore’s law.
However, this cannot realistically continue forever without dramatic changes to current technology. Manufacturers have pushed the limits of Moore’s law; their integrated circuits now measure at the nanometer length scale. This leaves little room for more transistors to be crammed on.
Yet, the demand for faster computers is still present. Self-driven cars, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and more efficient data centers are forcing companies to look to nanotechnology that will uphold Moore’s law and keep them at the top of the market.

Last week, at the Society of Toxicology’s annual meeting in Baltimore, MD, several companies joined the folds to improve chemical analysis to determine effects on human health without relying on animal testing.
Animal testing is and always will be a very controversial issue. Often, debate surrounds the morality, necessity, and application of animal testing.
There are many strict regulations with regard to animal testing, and different regulatory bodies, including Europe’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation & Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) program. One of the more prominent topics at the meeting was discussing how to manage regulatory assessment and review changes made to regulatory documents. As a part of the changes made to the United States’ Toxic Substance Control Act last year, one of the requirements is more data collection and reporting.
UL (formerly Underwriter Laboratories), a testing and certification company, made moves to reduce the need for animal testing with their new software called REACHAcross. According to UL, REACHAcross relies on machine learning to look at a chemical’s behavior by continually enhancing the software with data, thus reducing the need for animal testing.
Especially in recent years, one organization that promotes methods for reducing animal testing is Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM), which is a nonprofit organization. At the meeting this year, PCRM hosted a seminar that encouraged organizations to utilize “read-across” data management in order to predict the toxicity of a chemical. “Read-across” data management involves applying data of a known, tested chemical to an untested chemical of similar makeup.
Other nonprofit groups are looking into communicating directly with laboratories to secure the release of animals used for testing. One such organization, the Beagle Freedom Project, a nonprofit run by Animal Rescue, Media, and Education (ARME), has awarded $200,000 to scientists for developing alternative methods to animal testing.
In addition to providing methods to reduce animal testing at the meeting, a number of organizations are now sharing data, including Eli Lilly & Co., Dow AgroSciences, and the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute.

This week, Pugwash discussed President Donald Trump and his effect on the future of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Trump’s budget violently slashes the EPA by 31 percent, eliminating things such as climate change research and other scientific endeavors housed in the department.
Similar to other discussions we’ve had this year, Pugwash’s aim was to figure out what could be done to build the bridges between the EPA and parts of the population who have come to see it as emblematic of the Washington swamp.
Many in the coal industry blame former President Barack Obama’s regulations for the rapid decline of coal. This blame is misplaced, as it is natural gas that has undercut the market for coal. Furthermore, workers have been largely replaced by automation, making it harder for lifelong coal miners to find work. Many people in coal country who lost their jobs over the last eight years turned to Trump in an effort to hit back at Washington elites and revitalize the industry. This endangers the scientific research being done in an agency like the EPA that has been used to enforce the regulations. Since the energy and agriculture sectors, the industries most often associated with climate change, are such large employers in the United States, this turns vast swaths of the population against the EPA. Political polarization in the United States has led people to turn against the very existence of the EPA, not just the regulations that affect them.
One Pugwash member posited that this problem is made worse by the amount of money in industries associated with climate change. They spend much money on lobbying and campaign donations, so politicians oppose scientific research to keep their seats.
It’s difficult to convince the public that something like the EPA is important. Its mission can seem removed from a lot of people’s lives, and the major political lightning rod associated with the EPA, climate change, is seen by many people as a distant, abstract notion despite the real damage it has already caused. 
People prefer to hear about things that will affect them immediately, like the economy. Arguments about scientific consensus have little persuasive power. Trying to convince people with facts often has the opposite effect. This makes defending issues based on science a difficult proposition.
Trump’s budget almost certainly will not pass in its current form, but the hit to the EPA, along with the gag orders, poses a significant threat to scientific research and its communication. With little ability to change people’s minds through fact finding and increasingly hostile representation in government, scientists have found themselves in the political cross-hairs. This problem could represent a danger to the future of science in the United States.

New and cheaper vaccine developed to fight rotavirus
A heat-stable, cheap vaccine for rotavirus has been developed by Médecins Sans Frontiéres (MSF), or Doctors Without Borders, in Niger. The trial’s results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday, March 23. The new vaccine is “a game changer” according to Dr. Micaela Serafini, an MSF medical doctor.
The new vaccine could save hundreds of children per day. Rotavirus infection is the leading cause of severe diarrhea, and causes up to 1,300 child deaths per day around the world — primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. Lack of access to clean water is a strong driver of rotavirus’ spread.
Current vaccines for the virus exist, but they must be kept refrigerated at all times. This greatly limits the scope of communities the original vaccine could be delivered to. The new vaccine, named BRV-PV, is heat-stable, so it does not have to be kept in a fridge. BRV-PV is cheaper than previous versions of the vaccine, selling at $2.50.
The vaccine’s next hurdle is to be prequalified by the World Health Organization. Once this is done, it will be delivered to thousands of communities, preventing hundreds of children from dying per day around the world.

Arianespace rocket launch delayed due to worker strikes
A rocket launch from the French Guiana space center was postponed due to a strike. The employees of two companies and a local hospital protested at the space center over salary negotiations, stopping the launch of the Ariane 5 rocket. The rocket is carrying two telecommunication satellites from South Korea and the Brazilian government. Arianespace pushed the launch to Thursday, March 22, saying a “social movement” is the cause of the delay.
Employees of Endel, a transportation company for the space center, and EDF, an energy company, set up roadblocks around the space center, halting usual operations. Endel’s management reached an agreement with employees; however, the roadblocks still remain. Surrounding schools were closed as a result, and employees had to be flown into work to access the space center. The medical employees on strike come from the medical center in Kourou.
Arianespace said in a statement, “The evolution of the situation does not permit the restart of operations for the Ariane 5 launch scheduled for today.” These companies will have to come to new agreements with their employees.

Comcast gains rights to launch a streaming service
Telecommunications conglomerate Comcast is considering joining the live TV streaming market. It has received nation-wide TV channel rights to stream some networks. However, online video does not seem to be a top priority for Comcast.
“There is significantly more upside and profitability in going deeper and deeper into our base versus following a video-only offering OTT,” said Comcast VP Matt Strauss.
The online streaming market is growing rapidly, with AT&T’s DirecTV, Amazon Prime, and Netflix making large revenue from their services. If Comcast enters the market late, this may be detrimental to their returns.
Online streaming enables users to watch their favorite shows and movies on demand. It has already changed how many people watch TV, and is projected to continue to grow as a market in the coming years. It is even a major aspect of the smart TV, which enables you to surf the internet and stream content right to your TV display.
Before Comcast can launch a more competitive streaming product, it will need to acquire the rights to many more TV channels like CBS and ESPN. This would likely take a few more months.

For new Green Day fans, the Revolution Radio tour is an exciting experience — their energetic music and on-stage antics create a memorable experience. But, since the band has been successful for 30-plus years, many Green Day fans have already seen them play. For those concert-goers, the performance will seem like a rerun, with lead singer and guitarist Billy Joe Armstrong recycling many of the hype-up techniques that he has been using for years. 
The repetitiveness is clear even before the band takes the stage. The show opens with someone in a bunny costume frenetically dancing to The Ramone’s “Blitzkrieg Bop” before being dragged offstage by their ankles. Then the theme music from the film “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly” kicks in before they dive into their first song. This was amusing on the 99 Revolutions Tour when they did the exact same thing, but it feels worn out this time around. 
The staleness is most apparent when the band plays a string of pre-*American Idiot* tracks in the middle of the concert: “2000 Light Years Away,” “Hitchin’ a Ride,” “When I Come Around,” “Burnout,” “Waiting,” “Scattered,” and "Minority.” These short and raucous songs would be fun at a small venue but don’t translate well to a large arena. Also, their earlier work features a pretty straightforward and simple sound and structure compared to the more diverse musicality of their last several albums. This quickly becomes monotonous and would have stood out more had there been fewer of the old songs and had they been spread out over the concert. 
But these songs would have seemed less redundant had the band tore through them in three minutes each. Instead, these songs are also hurt by Armstrong’s tired schtick in which he chants “ay-oh” and then prompts the crowd to repeat after him. Not only has Armstrong been doing this for years, but he does it at least once every song. This routine quickly becomes annoying, and these short peppy songs start to drag. 
The first half of the concert did have some highlights. During “Holiday,” Armstrong launched into a moving and passionate speech that is a response to the new president and his talk on unity and love brought the crowd together. (Later in the show he also shouts “F*** you, Donald Trump!”) He also brings several fans onstage to sing, play guitar, and go crowd surfing — something he has done in the past but is always enjoyable because each person reacts differently. Finally, the Revolution Radio tour makes heavy use of pyrotechnics, with dazzling sparks showering down behind the band during a couple of songs and powerful explosions that were sometimes even coordinated with the music throughout the concert. These detonations sent shock waves to even the worst seats, and caught the audience by surprise every time. 
Two-thirds of the way through the concert, Green Day finally captures the energy that blasts listeners away on their albums. At the tail end of the string of early songs, with “Basket Case” and “She,” Armstrong ditched the “ay-oh,” preventing the songs from dawdling as they blew through the songs at a blistering pace. Green Day then mixed it up with the jaunty, saxophone-driven “King For A Day” which revved up the crowd, especially when they went into a bizarre medley of covers which included the Isley Brothers rhythm and blues tune “Shout” (best known from Animal House) as well as Monty Python’s silly “Always Look On The Bright Side of Life” and rock classics “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” and “Hey Jude.” While Green Day has done this in the past, the saxophone in “King For A Day” and the sultry and blaring solo played during the medley is a nice break from the guitar-heavy concert. For the final two songs of the main set, they played two stand-out songs from Revolution Radio: the hopeful, melodic “Still Breathing” and anthemic and layered “Forever Now.” (The band should have played more Revolution Radio tracks, like “Say Goodbye” or “Troubled Times,” in place of the earlier songs.)
The four song encore, however, was by far the show’s peak. After playing fan-favorite “American Idiot,” Green Day launched into the operatic, nine-minute “Jesus of Suburbia,” which was played with vigor and enthusiasm. Finally, Billy Joe Armstrong closed it out with two acoustic tunes. He started with his new song “Ordinary World” and finished with the popular “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life).” With just Armstrong and his guitar, the songs sounded pure, and his expressive voice rang clear through the arena as confetti fluttered through the air. While Armstrong’s tired schtick and the repetitiveness of the early songs created a doldrums during the middle of the show, it finished on the strong note.
The band took the stage this Saturday at the Peterson Event Center, and brought all their energy form Brooklyn with them. With a college-student heavy audience, the repetition was not as evident, and the hype was just as it would have been years ago. How the band has managed to endure this long is apparent, and they've managed to hold on to the vibes that came to life in their earlier work. If you haven't seen the eyeliner clad trio yet, go for it while you have the chance. It's bound to be the time of your life.

Future Tenant is a small gallery downtown that is home to exhibitions of emerging artists, and since opening last Friday it is now home to a small exhibition entitled Walk on By on homelessness in Pittsburgh. The show is curated by Jay Poliziani of Northside Common Ministiries, and it brings together a variety of artist from various disciplines, each taking their own approach to homelessness using mediums from theater to cartoon to sculpture. The work is a collaboration of volunteers connected to the ministry with more artist who joined in as the project grew. Walking through the exhibition space, you will see portrait line drawings and a documentary on a theater group working with homeless individuals. In the back is a collection of paintings and drawings from children talking about their experience growing up without a stable home. This piece is both bright and beautiful in color, but heart wrenchingly matter of fact. Political cartoons’ quip about the current government reveal frustration with the lack of resources and action to help individuals down on their luck. The show considers the diversity of individuals experiencing homelessness, considering children, people of color, women, and LGBTQ individuals as especially vulnerable groups.
Poliziani describes the idea of the show as a way of asking the viewers to simply engage with homeless individuals. He talks about how easy it is to walk by someone on the street, how uncomfortable it makes most of us and the way we avoid having to confront that. But, through the power of art and narrative, this show honors the fundamental humanity of these individuals. He says a simple “hi” or smile is enough, but it is not good for society to ignore the existence of people just because they reflect some difficult truths about economic security and poverty. Calling for compassion and understanding, each of these artists work in their own way with bring the unique stories of each of these people to the privileged consumers of art. 
Walk on By features Carnegie Mellon’s own Daniel See, a sophomore BHA Decision Science and Art major. His piece at first glance are these interesting, lumpy cylindrical forms, but upon closer inspection it is clear that they are actually hand prints grasping a cup. In each, there is a small card with the title of the project and a quote from the man whose hand marks the ceramic object. These mugs are beautiful and complex, a contradiction of intimacy and anonymity. The handprint is individual and a marker of a personal activity, taking a drink from a mug, but the whiteness of the mugs and the repetition of shapes gives a sense of homogeneity. Holding the mug allows you to get to know the individual, but at the same time you never see his face or really learn his story.
The project began when See approached Northside Common MInistries about volunteering with homeless shelters and how art can connect people. At the time, he was taking a sculpture class where he had to make multiple versions of the same object and he wanted to look outward to make the art about other people. One of these cultural shocks of moving to the US, especially a city like Pittsburgh, was the huge presence of homelessness and the ingrained way we ignore it at all cost. He felt deeply dissatisfied with just walking by and ignoring people on the streets and so, like any good artist, he decided to do something about it. The process, therefore, became essential to understanding the piece. Bringing clay mugs to the shelter where he volunteers, See had the men living there press their hands around the mug. At the end of the day, he brought these mugs back and baked them in a kiln. Each of these mugs then carried the stories and wisdom the men shared with See, and hand reaching out for connection and understanding.
Another notable piece in the show is a documentary short by University of Pittsburgh graduate Mark Janavel called It Should Feel Like Home. This film follows LGBTQ individuals and talks about their experiences and difficulties with shelters in Pittsburgh. The documentary was created to spotlight and potentially motivate shelters to change policy and the way they treat LGBTQ youth.  Recruited by fellow Pitt alumni Alexander McCarthy, who was the president of the Rainbow Alliance and working with Jay Poliziani, Janavel spent four days recruiting and ended up with twelve subjects to work with for the topic. This film will also be playing at the Pitt Undergraduate Film Symposium on March 30 at 6:00 pm.
These stories, often of young people, recount being rejected from shelters because issues with bathrooms or worrying about their safety because of their sexual orientation. The shelter becomes, for many people, synonymous with returning to the closet as the shared living space makes life uncomfortable and unsafe for trans and queer individuals. It makes clear not only the lack of resources and education, but also hope for changes in the system. This film is incredibly important because homelessness for LGBTQ youth is disproportionately higher and we as a society do not talk enough about difficulties faced by this community. Our faces of queer representation are far and few between, but those that exist tend to be wealthy Hollywood stars or tech moguls. The importance of having visuals and stories to connect issues with people is therefore vital because it validates their existence and urgency of their needs. 
The entirety of show reflects this drive for validation of humanity and compassion. Art and social change is a difficult field to enter because often times art points at social issues without providing solutions or really making a difference. Each time there is an opening from an organization that has set out to do good through art, this is a concern the viewer and the artist has to address. Walk on By is about awareness, but it is also about connection. The exhibition as a whole certainly has interesting curation because collectively these pieces do not have a target solution to a specific issue. Rather, each project moves in its own way — taking advantage of its own medium and audience — to connect with their subject and tell their story. These projects are still small, and by no means do they solve homelessness or economic inequality. Rather, the specificity of goals of each one and the diversity of action, when brought together, is a reminder to the viewer of the huge number of ways just one person can make a small difference. As much as the show is about homelessness, it is about kindness and breaking out of the urban isolation effect that happens when we get used to spending most of our time focused on our own worlds. That is what makes Walk on By special and a show that is definitely worth checking out.

Dear Ruth,
I HATE group projects — I always have. There is usually one person who completely pulls their weight. Two or so people try enough to scrape by, they're annoying but at least they do some work. Then there's that one person who's life mission is to reverse any progress made by the other group members. But, since my grades and well-being have depended on doing so, I've learned to just let it go and moved on. My new method of group work is just trying to do as much of the assignments as possible and then just send email updates to keep everyone on the same page. But now I've encountered a new problem. Nobody responds to my emails! No matter how many follow ups I send out or how nice I am or how many funny GIFs I attach, I still get nothing. It doesn't even make a difference when I switch from the formal "Hello" to the causal "Hey" and then to the passive aggressive "Hi!" I'm running out of ideas! Texts seem too informal to handle these pressing matters. I do NOT want more GroupMe notifications. I'll only go back to Facebook Messenger when they get rid of the dumb stickers. And what? Am I supposed to call them? On the phone? What is this... 2007? 
Sincerely, 
I Need Direct, Immediate Answers. Please Respond. I Can't Even.
Dear INDIA PRICE,
I'm going to be honest for a second here — I don't understand why professors assign group projects. I mean, okay, I get why (because it's practice for real projects at a real job in the real world... ugh), but it seems like there ought to be a better solution that doesn't put your grade in jeopardy just because your group member's girlfriend broke up with him three weeks ago and he's still inconsolable and unmotivated. (Like seriously? It's been a month! You only dated a month!)
But my moral, emotional, and spiritual qualms aren't going to help you if you're in the middle of a group project right now, because no professor is going to let you talk your way out of a group project due in a week. (You should talk to your professor, but we'll get to that.)
So, a three-step plan to get ahold of your good-for-not-nothing-but-very-little group-mates:
First, absolutely 100 percent text them. I know I'm much more likely to respond to a text than an email (and not entirely because I have a 600 unread email backlog...), and the fact is that a response should be your first priority. Who cares about how formal or informal the means is — you don't care if these people think you're a little weird, at least definitely not more than you care about that passing grade. (And I have to put in a good word for Facebook Messenger here: nothing like read receipts to let you know if they're actively ignoring you or not.) 
If texts don't work, then the second step requires some face-to-face time. If you have a project together, you have a class together. Corner them. Before or after class, either works, just make it so they have to stop and pay attention to you. It's easy to ignore someone over text — it's much more difficult to ignore them when they're blocking all of the viable exits.
The third step, which can happen at any point in this process, is that you should talk to your professor about your situation. Explain that your group-mates aren't responding and that you're doing your best to complete the project but you're having difficulty. Most professors are pretty understanding, especially if you can provide a log of google doc edits or something to prove your problems, but even if they aren't then the worst thing that happens is you tried.
So good luck, godspeed, and I hope your group-mates pull their heads out of their a**es and get over their girlfriends or whatever their problems are.
Ruth

Marvel’s newest show on Netflix, Iron Fist, focuses on Danny Rand, sole survivor of a plane crash that killed his incredibly wealthy parents, the founders of Rand Industries. He was presumed dead in New York but taken in by monks in the city of K’un-Lun, a mystical city near the plane crash, only to return home 15 years later. When Danny discovers sinister plots within his company, he hopes to weed them out and return Rand Industries to its glory with the help of his martial arts training from K’un-Lun and the power of a mystical force known as the Iron Fist.
But doesn’t this just sound a lot like Arrow, where playboy Oliver Queen was the sole survivor of a shipwreck and kept himself alive by training in martial arts before returning to his hometown five years later? A little bit. But all of Marvel’s other Netflix shows — Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage — have been great, so this show should be good too. Right?
Well, let me reel my criticisms back a bit. The show is incredibly mindless, meaning it’s a passable show if you just want to completely shut your brain off and have some noise running in the background. Iron Fist does improve over each episode, especially during the second half of the season. It expands the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) in a huge way by connecting each of the other Netflix shows together, mentioning the names of the other Netflix heroes and tying the characters and events of those series to form a history behind Marvel’s Netflix-based narratives. This nearly establishes a different world from the Marvel movies.
But from the first scene of the first episode, where a homeless-looking Danny Rand walks around New York to the tune of OutKast’s “So Fresh, So Clean,” you are left just as confused and lost as Danny is. In fact, the first three episodes of the series have little relevance to the overall plot of the show. Seeing Danny return to society from K’un-Lun was incredibly boring and set the show off on a bad foot, setting up an unnatural and bland vibe for the rest of the episodes moving forward. The characters are painted as extremely childish, often getting into verbal fights rather than actually resolving any character action. Additionally, the show was poorly written to an astounding degree, filled with banter and arguments that stick out as cliché and tiring. The show’s writing also comes off as slightly racist, making it just uncomfortable to watch. Combined with the show’s boring pace, Iron Fist constantly left me disheartened and exhausted.
The only clear point that Iron Fist makes in its beginning is of the show’s plan for a martial-arts centered story – which would be great if the fighting sequences were as exciting as hinted. The fourth episode of the series shows the huge faults of these fighting sequences, moving at what feels like a sluggish pace. The use of slow motion during most of the fight sequences adds to the slow pace of the show, and seems unnecessary to each scene as a whole. While the motion and pace pick up halfway around the series, the other film techniques that the show uses, such as a shaky camera, are still utilized poorly.
What also contributed to the show’s discouraging potential and vibe was Finn Jones, the former Game of Thrones actor who plays the lead role of Rand. Since the announcement of the show, fans petitioned for Marvel to hire an Asian-American actor to play the role of Rand. The original comic property, created in the 70s, played to outdated racist stereotypes of Asians. Fans argued that casting an Asian-American actor, rather than staying true to the comics’ “white savior” trope and casting a white actor, would not only update the property for the modern day, but also introduce new and interesting storytelling elements to the character. However, defenders of Jones argued that casting an Asian as a kung-fu master pushes that racial stereotype forward and would put the media focus of the show solely on Danny rather than the entire show. After Jones was cast, the controversy only solidified in its place and was subsequently made worse by Jones’ overtly-childlike characterization of Rand from the writers. Jones’ performance only amplified his annoyingly youthful characteristics, coming across as infuriatingly stubborn and arrogant. Coupled with the show’s poor timing of its release two weeks prior to the release of the equally controversial Ghost in the Shell and as the next entry into the MCU after the controversial Doctor Strange, its controversy has now become a permanent fixture in the show’s history and discussion.
Despite the initially childish writing, the supporting characters of the show eventually became intriguing to watch. The dynamic of siblings Joy and Ward Meachum, Danny’s family friends, became interesting to see throughout the show. Actress Jessica Stroup’s portrayal of Joy is heartfelt yet fierce, while seeing Ward’s character devolve was fascinating and ultimately heartbreaking to see.  
However, Jessica Henwick’s performance as Colleen Wing, a martial arts teacher who befriends Danny in the first episode, was one of the biggest highlights of the show for me. Henwick portrays Colleen as multidimensional and makes her initially aloof personality charming. Seeing Henwick on screen always filled me with excitement, and I saw parts of myself in Wing, an Asian-American New Yorker, filling me with pride. Despite this, her character towards the end of the season ended up falling into the clichéd role of a love interest that left me confused and let down, and the decision seemed uncharacteristic of her. While Henwick’s performance was the breakout of the show and amazing to see, her overall character unfortunately left me a little disappointed.
I had few motivators to drive me to watch this show: I’m writing a review on it for this paper, it’s a Marvel property, and it’s incredibly integral to the upcoming Marvel Netflix show The Defenders. Apart from that, even thinking about the show just lets me down. Additionally, the show’s reception has also begun to set up a divisive front between defenders, who appreciate the surface value of fun of the show, and attackers, disappointed by the show’s greater potential, which is the most disheartening result of Iron Fist’s release.

After Ariel rudely referred to my stand-in last week as being “prettier” than me, I probably shouldn’t have been so kind as to go out with her again this week. Alas, I decided to let my truly kind heart prevail over my better judgment and forgave her for this transgression. This week, we headed to South Highland’s Shadyside Hideaway.
The location: Shadyside Hideaway is nestled in between Mad Mex and Millie’s Homemade Ice Cream on South Highland Street. While this is a prime location, Mad Mex’s kitchen closes at midnight and Millie’s closes at ten, so this bar doesn’t work out for things like midnight munchies. That is something to keep in mind lest you find yourself hungry at 1 a.m. leaving Shadyside Hideaway.
The drinks: I ordered an "Iron City" and Ariel grabbed a whiskey ginger. It seemed this would be the best use of our ability to get drinks at this stop, but I also watched the bartender make a tequila sunrise for someone. A tequila sunrise is not a complex beverage, but maybe we did not take advantage of the options to the point necessary to evaluate the drinks. The bar has a neighborhood feel to it, so ordering anything more ostentatious seemed out of place at this establishment.
The vibe: They were playing The LEGO Movie on the big screen when we walked in. No one seemed to notice. They were once playing March Madness on the television and never bothered to change it for at least two hours once the games were over resulting in a bar for adults playing this children’s movie.
Other than that, the vibe was a lot like any other neighborhood bar. The bartender spoke to the patrons as if they were close friends, and they very well might have been. There’s a small outdoor area that we decided to stay by, and there are plenty of couches, tables, and stools inside for the number of people who were there. We stayed outside, which gave us a bit of separation from the rest of the patrons and therefore a spot to sit and talk. The bar is not particularly spacious, but unless we went on a down night, the space is good to just sit and hang out with a friend.
Lit or Nah: Nah, since this isn’t really the type of bar to go and get lit. It’s a neighborhood bar that seems to be actively avoiding college students who might prefer the nearby Urban Tap. This is the place to take a buddy for a drink and catch up, not the place for a night out making ruckus and other activities that you youths enjoy. In fact, if “lit” is the adjective you would use for a good night out, it seems Shadyside Hideaway never wanted you there in the first place.

Rhythm and Blues and music by black artists have taken on various contingents throughout the years, including the still familiar styles of smooth soul ballads and energetic funk and disco produced by artists like Teddy Pendergrass, P-Funk, and Donna Summer in the 1970s and early '80s.  Such sounds, so familiar to Western audiences, also happened to make their way to Japan, where they were distilled into an unusual form of R&B that incorporated the stylings of Japanese pop and traditional music. The scene for such music burgeoned as the nation’s postwar economic boom led to an era of glitz and glamour among the decadent youth who inhabited the then new phenomenon of discotheques that started popping up in the country. Ace Records subsidiary Beat Goes Public has just released Lovin’ Mighty Fire: Nippon Funk Soul Disco 1973-1983, the first compilation to be released in the West that specifically examines the fascinating Japanese R&B music of the 1970s to the early '80s. 
The compilation was assembled by Howard Williams, an expert on Western-tinged Japanese music who has also worked on compilations of Japanese surf guitarist Takeshi Terauchi, Rock n Roller Masaaki Hirao, and Japanese girl group '60s pop. Throughout the album, American musical influence is evident; however, much of the music is more reminiscent of the electronic, synth-laden Euro-Disco of producers like Giorgio Moroder and Cerrone or of the sultry, breathy girl vocals on songs like “Yes Sir, I Can Boogie” by Baccara.
Lovin’ Mighty Fire draws in its Western listeners by opening with a rapid, funky take on something close to the stereotypical “Asian riff” in the 1973 song “By By Session Band,” by Lily, a Japanese American singer whose backing band at the time gave the song its title. The song features some jazz lines on electric keyboard along with break-beat drums. Being that the song is from the earlier part of the '70s it certainly falls within the categorization of funk, but might also be better understood as jazz fusion, similar to music recorded contemporaneously by artists like Reuben Wilson for labels like Groove Merchant. Jazz fusion was often just jazz fused with rock so “By By Session Band” might also legitimately fit on a compilation of progressive rock. Worth noting is another “Asian style” riff on Masayoshi Takanaka’s pleasant 1981 instrumental (minus brief electronic vocals) “Rainbow Paradise.”  
Another track from 1973 is Japanese journeyman musician Haruomi Hosono’s “Barato Yajuu”. It is pulled off an album that marked a somewhat revolutionary divergence from the norm of Japanese record production at the time. Hosono recorded 1973’s Hosono House at his home when typically record companies had total control over the recording process for musicians and required them to record on booked studio dates. The unique way the song was recorded gives it a somewhat ghostly ambience as Hosono’s calm vocals pour over a laid back hi-hat driven slow funk. Keeping with the laid back funk, Mari Natsuki’s “Uragiri” from 1976 is what the “soul” in the compilation’s title is referring to as a keyboard styling similar to the one from “Use Me” by Bill Withers provides the backdrop for Natsuki’s sensual, breathy vocal.  
There are a few moments of English on Lovin’ Mighty Fire, with the irresistible cover of Roberta Flack’s “Why Don’t You Move In With Me” by Yasuko Agawa from 1980 perhaps being the brightest. Agawa’s sweet, high vocals in semi-broken English juxtapose the eponymous question with the catchy phrase “we could be so happy,” as the two simple lines work like a fishing hook to the listener’s consciousness. The song is upbeat disco, complete with thumping elastic bass and bass drum complemented by slick guitar riffs and horns. While thoroughly of its time, the song is timeless in its simplicity and hook, if not necessarily the most cerebral piece.
The album also features a few moments of intense disco inferno. Pink Lady’s “Jiken Ga Okitara Bel Ga Naru” from 1979 reaches an urgent pace as a fast, funky riff spurs the flamboyant, sexy girl duo’s fluid, in fact almost rapped, Japanese brings to mind sirens and car chases. Another particularly intense moment is the impressive electro-funk representing the end of the album’s chronology in 1983, “Dancin’” by Junko Ohashi, another English language song. The song kicks off with about 10 seconds of synthesizer orchestration before the beat kicks in — and boy does it ever — with a quintessential early '80s funk bass line like those of Rick James, filled with synth punches as the bass rests. The compilation’s title track “Lovin’ Mighty Fire” by Naoya Matsuoka and Minako Yoshida from 1979 is another English language disco rager that, as its name suggests, catches fire. The song begins with a slow funk that builds to mid-tempo as sultry female vocals glide over before coming to a sudden solo guitar riff joined by a synthesizer crescendo that leads into an upbeat disco groove with synthesizer key strikes that jump out like the sonic equivalent of lasers in addition to the punch of slick horns.  
In the '70s a number of American acts played Japan including momentous tours by R&B artists like James Brown and The Commodores. An obscure black band called Ebonee Webb that was signed to the legendary Hi Records in Memphis, home of Al Green, also sought success in the land of the rising sun. After a successful club tour, the band linked up with a local Japanese producer in 1979 to record an album of soul styled Japanese folk songs in Japanese. “Yashow Macashow” is a real oddity in that it provides an inverse to the rest of Lovin’ Mighty Fire as it is what a “genuine” American R&B act sounds like singing in Japanese, rather than Japanese acts trying to sound like an American R&B act. 
The lines between funk, soul, and disco are often blurred to say the least. We often think of different cultures as isolated or as developing in some kind of vacuum, but Lovin’ Mighty Fire makes it crystal clear that the transition that occurs between cultures blurs the lines of these genres even further. Frequently, in funk and R&B, West goes East, but with the release of this album East goes back West. This album provides just a taste, and hopefully it will not be the last we hear, of funky Japan in the West.

“The black person seeking soul rejuvenation and renewal.
We are tired, we are sick and tired of being sick and tired.
Rejuvenation is key, in the age of self-preservation. 
Our bodies are fragile, but our souls are full of a thousand songs, poems, books, the rejuvenation library.
We are asking for a year of relaxation, reflection, safety. 
The spa year for the black soul, self-love, safety and tranquility in reminder that you are not alone in the struggle for black liberation. 
Rest your body in the warm words and songs of Solange, Nina Simone, James Baldwin, caressed by Audre Lorde. 
Full soul massage, free of charge, supplied by the black love and black blood in our veins.
We are, in love with ourselves, and each other. 
Purely refreshed, the rejuvenated body/soul, pure honey.
New body, celebration of blackness. 
We are, in love with ourselves, and each other.”
This is the manifesto of junior art student Kasem Kydd’s ongoing project The Black Soul Rejuvenation Library, opening its first show at the Frame Gallery. This all began October of last year, in response to rhetoric and coverage of violence against people of color in the United States. With both the activist Black Lives Matter movement and the white supremacist alt-right movement gaining momentum through social media and online platforms, the sharing of information began to play a central role in his conception of this project. “This information overload is unhealthy,” he says, referring specifically to the psychological toll that sensationalized violence and inescapable reports of bigotry takes on black individuals. He describes the impact to be akin to PTSD, anxiety which sticks with you in day-to-day life. 
This constant fear for one’s safety and well being that Kydd describes, is a topic that researchers are still working to understand in minority groups. Researchers have found that rates of clinically assessed PTSD symptoms in urban communities touched by violence are comparable to those in returning veterans from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Vietnam [http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/3/ptsd-mental-healthgunviolencetrauma.html], but this goes beyond individuals living in inner cities. The impact of discrimination and systemic violence Kydd describes reaches so many people because of way people respond to sustained threat. 
Sustained threat is best described through a famous analogy involving a glass of water. A psychologist supposedly asked her class “How heavy is this glass of water?” After hearing guesses of the weight, she replied saying that the absolute weight does not matter. Rather, the significant factor is how long she was holding the glass. Holding the water for a minute might not be so bad, but if she held the glass of water every day for years her arm would become excruciatingly fatigued. For Kydd, the water glass is the stress of questioning, "am I being treated this way because I am black? Is my safety in jeopardy because of my race?" When worrying about one’s safety and those like you becomes highly regular, it translates into a kind of hypervigilance which is emotionally exhausting and ultimately unhealthy. 
From this issue was The Black Soul Rejuvenation Library born. Kydd describes this project as an act of healing for those who are fighting for justice. Intended to have both an online and real-life presence, it is a place for people to pause to feel — as the title suggests — rejuvenated through the celebration of self and identity. Activism is a marathon, not a sprint. Kydd’s work points to the importance of staying physically, emotionally, and spiritually healthy throughout the process, and the need for spaces to exist where one can do so. Through online platforms [http://blacksoullibrary.tumblr.com/ https://www.instagram.com/blacksoulrejuvenation/], Kydd has collected samples of black culture and the work of black artists. The website undoubtedly still displays calls for action, but it does so through introspection and self-love. To be clear, this is not about avoidance and complacency, but about countering a dangerous and prejudiced world with spaces where people of color can focus on self-care and the good there is to fight for. 
The exhibition at the Frame Gallery is Kydd’s first move to bring this offline and marks the halfway point of this project. The show is a mix of art objects, including an installation called "When the Squad Links up and Smashes the Militarized Police" and a public library of books where viewers can take and place literature on the subject of blackness. His own work is also placed in the exhibition, dealing with topics of black masculinity and shrines, with pieces that invite the viewer to interact with the topic.
He talks about cultural alchemy, exemplified in "Spilled My Wave Cream but Im [NO APOSTROPHE] still 360" where he takes everyday objects such as wave cream and transforms them into holy relics through the shrine-like sculpture, where they stand in suspended state. Alchemy is also a present theme in his work that deals with self portraiture. Through the use of gold and chiaroscuro lighting, traditional to Italian religious painting, the sculptural presentation of his self portrait photography has a similar effect of the exultation in self. Socialization in this society often dehumanizes black individuals, making black males out to be inherently predatory, criminal, and less than. The spiritual love of the self in such a society is perhaps one of the most powerful acts of rebellion to counter this kind of messaging. Self portraiture and cultural icons have a long history in art activism for this reason.
And thus, the viewer is asked to follow in his footsteps. To reflect on culture and history, to find pride in who you are and where you’ve come from. It creates this beautiful dialogue between creator and viewer, subverting their roles and the distance between pieces. The exhibition at the Frame is a start. It shows the incredible potential of The Black Soul Rejuvenation Library. He is hoping to receive more submissions from people of color in the CMU and Pittsburgh community, to fully embrace the collaborative nature of this project. He is also planning to move outside of the University, working around Pittsburgh in community spaces and restaurants to tackled projects involving self love and economic stability. Healing of a broken society and healing of the self; if there was ever any question of whether art can be healing, Kydd’s work is a force to look out for that will remove any doubts from your mind.

In light of the recent wave of bomb threats that have been phoned into Jewish community centers, Carnegie Mellon hosted Shabbat 1000, a service and dinner open to the public, with several Pittsburgh government and university officials in attendance in a show of solidarity.
Shabbat is the Jewish day of rest, observed from sundown on Friday night to nightfall on Saturday evening. For the Jewish community, it is a time to take a break from work or school at the end of a week for religious observance, which usually consists of gathering in a synagogue or home for festive meals.
Dignitaries in attendance included Carnegie Mellon President Subra Suresh, Pennsylvania state representative Dan Frankel, Pittsburgh mayor William Peduto, and county executive Rich Fitzgerald, among others. Many attendees wore maroon T-shirts saying Shabbat 1000 and matching maroon kippot.
There was already a palpable party atmosphere in the air even before the commencement of the main program. Visitors greeted friends with enthusiasm and smiles, and there was rarely a shortage of people who wanted to talk to the dignitaries. Cameras were busily snapping group pictures of those in attendance.
The main event started with an announcer greeting everyone with “Shabbat Shalom”, Hebrew for “Sabbath of Peace”. The evening’s themes encompassed unity, family, community, and togetherness.
Since electronics are not used on Shabbat, the speeches were projected by the speakers from the podium at one end of the room. One of the announcers, whose day job is being a psychiatrist, said that Shabbat 1000 was the “largest group that’s ever come together for group therapy.”
The seven Pittsburgh-area schools that were represented at the dinner were then recognized publicly as the announcer read their names and some distinguishing facts about the school. The announcer had hidden a Scottish highland dress under his long overcoat, and revealed the dress to the cheering crowd as he recognized Carnegie Mellon as the host.
The next speaker was county executive Rich Fitzgerald, who welcomed the attendees and remarked that he was proud of the community for being able to come together during a time when the country often seems more polarized than ever.
Mayor Peduto spoke next on the theme of unity. He said that even though there is so much in our discourse today about what divides us, “in Pittsburgh, we build bridges, not walls,” in a not-so-subtle jab at the pledge by President Trump to build a border wall. He also emphasized that nothing is more powerful than compassion. Carnegie Mellon’s President Suresh also touched on a similar theme, noting that the Shabbat dinner celebrates peace and unity.
The speeches were followed by group singing and blessing rituals, after which dinner commenced. There was another short speech from one of the announcers about a certain section of the Torah, the Jewish holy text, that discusses the process of temple building. He then extended the metaphor to say that we ourselves are like temples in that we all have unique qualities and should make temples in our body by being peaceful, loving, and caring.
While discussing unity and solidarity — and having a dinner in honor of those themes — sounds good, meaningful action is necessary to bring the themes into the real world. In an interview with The Tartan, Mayor Peduto discussed the Welcoming Pittsburgh initiative started in 2015. This particular initiative reaches out to immigrants and refugees in the Pittsburgh area. More recently, it has become more focused on reaching out to the Latino and Muslim communities. He assured that Pittsburgh police will not act as immigration enforcement agents and will not work with ICE unless there is a criminal arrest warrant for a person. Mayor Peduto wants minority communities to know that Pittsburgh is here to help them.

One of Carnegie Mellon’s greatest strengths has come from its role in attracting female students to STEM fields — areas of study that have been heavily skewed towards men for decades. On March 8, Carnegie Mellon University’s Leadership and Negotiation Academy for Women was recognized as the top program for continued education for organizational development and leadership by HR.com’s 2017 Leadership Excellence Awards. This honor recognized the university’s involvement as a leading institution for teaching female leaders critical negotiation skills for decades.
“This award is a great honor for the academy, its participants, and all of those who have worked so hard to make it the premier program that it is today,” Leanne Meyer, the director of the Academy, states in a university press release. “It is wonderful to be recognized among our distinguished colleagues from Cornell, Stanford, Harvard, and many other leading universities.” Meyer is also the director of leadership development at Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business.
The Carnegie Mellon Leadership and Negotiation Academy for Women is a collaboration between the Program for Research and Outreach on Gender Equity in Society, Carnegie Mellon’s Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy, and the Tepper School of Business. Its mission is to teach female leaders critical negotiation skills that they need to succeed in the workplace. At five years old, the program develops skills in female executives who are preparing to assume significant leadership roles and the responsibilities that come along with them. Participants master techniques in important areas of knowledge like negotiation, leadership brand, communicating with impact, conflict management within teams, and financial decision-making.
Carnegie Mellon’s Leadership and Negotiation Academy for Women was founded by Linda Babcock, the James Walton Professor of Economics and head of the Department of Social and Decision Sciences, as well as the late MJ Tocci. Babcock also holds an appointment in the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy.
“The Leadership and Negotiation Academy has made a tremendous impact on both my professional and personal life,” said Kathryn Heidemann, who holds the position of Carnegie Mellon’s assistant dean for arts and entertainment. “I was able to apply negotiation strategies to my life with a near-immediate ‘return on my investment’, and also make lifelong friends that will likely be champions for my whole career and beyond.”
People who participate in this program receive more than 100 hours of instruction from experts in both academia and the industry. They are also eligible for one-on-one coaching following an assessment which identifies areas of need and provides insight into leadership and negotiation strategies.
As a senior director of event strategy at Merkle Inc., Erin Hutchinson reflected on how the academy helped her become more valuable as a worker. “The academy has provided me with leadership insights that have had a meaningful impact on my relationships and on my approach to business,” she said. “With a strong and unique focus on executive skills, the academy has helped me hone those that I already had and has helped me develop and grow others so that I’m now able to add more value to my organization and create more impact than ever before.”
Meyer adds that “since its inception, the Leadership and Negotiation Academy for Women has helped women build valuable skills that can be immediately translated into their professional and personal lives. We look forward to expanding our portfolio of opportunities for professional women in the future, as we have with the recent addition of our Women on the Rise program.”
In addition to the Women on the Rise program, which seeks to help emerging leaders, in 2016, the Tepper School has incorporated leadership and networking workshops, custom programs for corporations, and professional conferences into its opportunities for women.

Materials Science and Engineering and Engineering and Public Policy Professor Jay Whitacre will be made director of the Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation. Whitacre will officially take over the position on May 1 from Jared Cohon, the president emeritus and Professor of Engineering and Public Policy and Civil and Environmental Engineering.
Whitacre has been part of the Carnegie Mellon community since 2007, when he left the Jet Propulsion Laboratory after investigating how materials and devices could be utilized for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Once at Carnegie Mellon, Whitacre created a new kind of battery chemistry and model that contained both non-flammable and non-toxic chemicals. This battery became the central point for the energy storage company Aquion Energy that Whitacre started in 2009.
Additionally, Whitacre has been a member of numerous boards of energy technology companies and has been part of committees for the National Academics of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Whitacre was also honored with the Lemelson-MIT Prize in 2015 for creating the environmentally friendly battery that was the first of its kind.
“In today’s energy-constrained world, it is more important than ever for Carnegie Mellon to remain on the cutting-edge of research, education, and innovation in energy technology and policy,” Provost Farnam Jahanian said in a university press release. “Bringing Jay’s wealth of experience in energy research and business development to the Scott Institute will ensure Carnegie Mellon continues to play a leadership role in this key strategic area.”
In 2012, the Scott Institute was founded with the intention of facilitating and encouraging scientific research that would increase energy efficiency, make improvements in energy policies and technologies, and search for possible energy sources. By adding Whitacre as the director of the Institute, the Scott Institute hopes to have a greater relationship with corporations that will ensure the University’s contribution to the area.
“I decided that this was a good time to pass the directorship of the Scott Institute to the next generation of emerging faculty leaders,” Jared Cohon said. “We have created a firm foundation of programs and staff on which real progress and growth can be built, and I think Professor Whitacre is an outstanding choice to lead the institute into its exciting future.”
Cohon became the director of the Scott Institute after taking over the position from M. Granger Morgan, its first director. Morgan’s vision for the institute was to relate Carnegie Mellon’s research to public policy.
“There are over 130 professors now listed as affiliates of the institute, either by research, academic or other energy-related activities at Carnegie Mellon,” Whitacre said. “Generating new bodies of collaborators that are creating top-notch results, and bringing in funding as free-standing entities — that is a large part of the institute’s mission: To be a hub for that kind of initial collaboration.”
Under Cohon’s watch, the Scott Institute became the impactful research center that Whitacre will be taking over.
“On behalf of the campus community and stakeholders affiliated with the Scott Institute, I would like to thank Jared Cohon for his invaluable contributions and tireless work toward putting the institute on the path to a bright future,” Dean of Carnegie Mellon’s College of Engineering James H. Garrett Jr. said. “We wish him the best as he returns to focusing all of his attention on his faculty duties.”

Hosted by the Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, and featuring over 130 energy experts, Carnegie Mellon’s annual Energy Week will take place from March 27 to 31. Each day of Energy Week will focus on a theme: The Future of Energy, Innovation, Research, Policy, and Education.
Monday: Future of Energy Day
Monday will include multiple Energy, Environment, and Equity (E3) Technology Innovator Conference discussions as well as an Energy Science, Technology and Policy Energy Symposium (EST&P) student competition and panel.
Sponsored by the Energy Innovation Center and Carnegie Mellon’s Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, E3 panels will focus on networking, the future of clean technology, and the future of grid modernization.
EST&P’s student competition will allow students to present novel ideas in low-carbon energy innovation, which includes advancements in both renewable and conventional energy. Finalists will eventually have to present their ideas to a panel of judges. There will also be a panel in the afternoon where guests and university faculty members will discuss the future of low-carbon energy and the associated career opportunities in energy.
Tuesday: Innovation Day
Tuesday will include two keynote speeches. Paul Browning, President and CEO of Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, will start off the day by delivering a talk titled “The Next Gigawatt.” Later on, JB Straubel, Chief Technology Officer of Tesla Motors, will discuss opportunities for students in building a sustainable future.
Collegiate teams from Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and Maryland will also be delivering pitches for the Allegheny Cleantech Collegiate University Prize Competition, sponsored by the Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). Winners will receive cash prizes, mentoring, and services to advance their technology and company.
Wednesday: Research Day
Wednesday will include multiple 20-minute “Andy Talks” on innovative research by Carnegie Mellon faculty members. Topics include understanding the social and economic costs of transporting crude oil, how our job, energy, and national security depend on who makes what, and a multi-stakeholder approach to sustainable behavior change.
There will also be an energy-themed dramatic monologue competition performed by Carnegie Mellon drama students. The three pieces are: “Power to the Potato,” written by Annie Pulsipher and performed by Amanda Fallon Smith; “In the Dark,” written by Daniel Hirsch and performed by Aubyn Heglie; and “Mother Nature has Gas,” written by Seanan Palmero and performed by Lea DiMarchi. The audience will vote on which performances they like best.
Thursday: Policy Day
Thursday will include a roundtable on regional energy workforce and development. The roundtable’s purpose is to “better understand the current and potential future status of the region’s energy workforce, looking broadly at energy efficiency, renewables, shale and coal, and what workforce and development analysis and policies would enhance its development,” as stated on the official Carnegie Mellon Energy Week website.
In an additional panel, film scholars and historians will consider the local, global, and racial implications of the emergence of Pittsburgh as an “Energy Capital.” This conversation will be framed through the films Gasland, a documentary that follows director Josh Fox as he investigates the environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing, and Promised Land, a story of two corporate salespeople who visit a rural town in an attempt to buy drilling rights from the local residents.
Friday: Education Day
Friday will include a keynote address titled “The Outlook for Electricity Supply and Demand, Transportation Energy Use, and Hydrocarbon Production in the United States,” presented by Howard Gruenspecht, the deputy administrator of the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Friday will also include several contesting energy panels which will focus on topics such as the promise and peril of petroleum work in America, understanding the risks of energy production, and the temporality of energy landscapes.
“Making energy more efficient, affordable, and sustainable is one of the biggest challenges of this century, and the Scott Institute and Carnegie Mellon have a lot to contribute. We’re looking forward to the conversations and interactions during Energy Week,” said Jared L. Cohon, president emeritus and director of the Scott Institute in a university press release. .
A full list of events can be found at cmuenergyweek.org.

If you log in on Thursday, March 30 to vote in student government election then you might notice something different: Single Transferable Vote (STV) is being brought to campus!
Up until last year, Carnegie Mellon employed the First Past the Post voting system, which elects the candidate with the most votes. Ryan LaPré, cabinet member, constitution advisor to Student Government, and the person who’s been working on this idea for the past year and a half, states “by switching to STV, we are trying to implement a system by which every position or seat is most preferred by the voting body. STV is a representative system, so it attempts to satisfy the largest number of people by accounting for their preferences in the election.”
This coming Thursday, you will be able to numerically rank your candidates of choice by whom you’d most like to see in a particular position. Enlisting someone as your no. 2 choice means that if your first choice didn’t run, they would be your new no. 1. Are there four candidates but you only want to vote for one? List that person as your no. 1 choice, and select “No Confidence” for choices 2–4.
STV is especially influential in Senate voting. In the 2015 spring election, there were 12 candidates vying for eight seats as representatives of Dietrich in the Undergraduate Student Senate. After the votes are in with STV, the person with the least amount of first-choice votes gets eliminated from the race. The ballots that listed this person as their first choice are now reanalyzed and the votes that were distributed to the now-eliminated candidate are reallocated to their second-choice. After reallocation, whoever has the most top-choice votes is ensured a seat. This process of elimination of the lowest-polling and redistribution of votes to voter’s next top choice continues until all eight seats are filled.
The 2015 spring election was actually determined by selecting the eight candidates with the highest voting percentages. What if that ninth candidate was actually a majority of people’s no. 2 choice? The STV system, in this case, would have elected this candidate, facilitating a student Senate where Senators selected are more fully representative of the actual wishes of the student body.
If this is in any way confusing, a tutorial will be accessible on the StuGov elections website to walk students through our new voting system. In addition, I definitely recommend CGP Grey’s video on STV Voting on YouTube (which I relied heavily on to understand the intricacies of this system, despite Ryan’s excellent communication about what STV voting actually was).
As someone who daydreams about accurately representative democracies, I am so excited about this change! And of course, remember to vote on March 30!

Carnegie Mellon professor Carol Frieze wins 2017 A. Nico Habermann Award
Carol Frieze was selected to receive the 2017 A. Nico Habermann Award from the Computing Research Association (CRA) as recognition for her successful efforts to increase the achievements of under-represented groups in computer science.
Frieze directs two campus initiatives which aim to promote diversity in the field of computer science: Women@SCS, which promotes opportunities for women among students and faculty, and SCS4ALL, which lets students take the lead in working to expand the participation of minorities at Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science (SCS).
SCS consistently enrolls a number of women far above the national average, thanks in part to Frieze's work. Just last fall, the number of women in SCS's freshman class — which amounted to almost half the class — set a school record.
"Carol's nomination letters attest that she played an important role in creating an inclusive environment at Carnegie Mellon, and her research can help others learn best practices and insights to help spread this type of progress beyond her home institution to the entire community," the CRA said, quoted in a university press release.
In addition to the programs she directs, Frieze organizes "roadshows" to introduce students in grades K-12 to computer science, summer workshops where high school teachers can learn more about the field, and workshops to encourage undergraduate women to consider computer science careers.
Frieze also received the Mark Gelfand Award for Educational Outreach, also for her work promoting women and minorities, in 2015. In 2016 she received the AccessComputing Capacity Building Award, along with Human-Computer Interaction Institute associate professor Jeff Bingham, for her work advancing students with disabilities in computing.
Creative Chaos builds on Entertainment Technology Center’s focus on innovation
Creative Chaos, a new book from Carnegie Mellon's Entertainment Technology Center (ETC), focuses on teaching interdisciplinary groups to collaborate creatively and effectively.
The ETC, founded jointly by the School of Computer Science and the College of Fine Arts, has a wide range of students with backgrounds in everything from computer science and engineering to graphics or visual effects, and even theater, creative writing, business, and music. In the program, students work in interdisciplinary teams to complete semester-long game development projects, robotics projects, animation pieces, location-based installations and more.
Creative Chaos came out of a study performed by Laurie Weingart, senior associate dean in the Tepper School of Business, and two doctoral students focusing on how these interdisciplinary teams affect innovative work. The study found that "teams with more expertise diversity had more conflict about the tasks in the form of disagreements and debates," but that final products that arose from such teams were "more innovative, useful, usable and desirable," a university press release reported.
Weingart believes that the ETC offers an environment where these kinds of teams can succeed. The book is intended to help other groups and organizations create a similar culture themselves.
Thanks to the training the program offers, ETC alumni have found careers in many companies throughout the entertainment industry, including Schell Games, a Pittsburgh game design and development company founded by Carnegie Mellon alumnus Jesse Schell and Naughty Dog, a video game developer. An increased understanding of how to work with others and build on their strengths makes these students sought after by many such companies.

Hundreds of black and Latina teenage girls have been disappearing in staggering numbers in the D.C. area, and nobody seemed to notice until recently. 
Since January, over 500 children and teenagers were reported missing and, as of March 22, twenty-two are still yet to be found. 
This lack of attention may not be completely surprising with the media's wall-to-wall coverage of our current president's political antics. Still, we know the media is not shy about providing extensive coverage surrounding cases of missing women, so why haven't these girls been given the same treatment?
This might make more sense when looking at the description of some of the girls. 
One 15-year-old who was last seen Jan. 10 in the 700 block of M Street SE was black. Another 14-year-old who was last seen Feb. 2 in the 1300 block of Saratoga Avenue NE was also black. Just this past week, a 14 year-old was last seen on the 4000 block of 6th Street, Southeast. She was also black. 
Derrica Wilson, co-founder and chief executive of the Black and Missing Foundation, says that though black people make up 13.2 percent of America's population, people of color account for 40 percent of all missing persons cases in the country. Journalist Gwen Ifill is said to have originated the phrase "missing white women syndrome," which describes the extensive media coverage that often surrounds the disappearances of young, upper-middle-class white girls. This is why you probably remember the names Natalie Holloway, Elizabeth Smart, and Jon Benet Ramsey, but have never heard of Relisha Rudd.
In light of the disparate coverage of missing black and Latina girls, Rudd's story has once again been brought to light. In 2014, Rudd lived with her mother at a homeless shelter at the old D.C. General Hospital. She was eight years old. Rudd was reportedly last seen spending time with the shelter's janitor, Kahlil Tatum, who shot his wife and then himself not long after. It was later suspected that Tatum abducted Rudd and killed her. 
As this investigation was unfolding, The Washington Post was the only major news outlet that made an effort to keep track of the story. Rudd's body was never found and her story disappeared along with her. 
On the other hand, news sites such as The Washington Times, CBS News, Fox News, and NBC Washington, all released stories about 46-year-old Tricia McCauley, a D.C. yoga instructor who went missing last Christmas and was found soon after in the car of her alleged attacker. There have also been several  in-depth stories released this past week on the mystery surrounding Tom Brady's missing jersey — a jersey. While this may be of extreme importance to the sports community, it is shocking that there wasn't a similar, widely reported manhunt being undertaken for actual human beings that have gone missing.
D.C. police officials also stated that they have not seen an increase in the number of missing people in their jurisdiction. "We've just been posting them on social media more often," department spokesperson Rachel Reid explained. Chanel Dickerson, commander of the D.C. police’s Youth and Family Services Division, says that these recently reported cases could also be due to better reporting by family members. 
Earlier this month, the Metropolitan Police Department stepped up efforts to find these "critically missing" girls by sending out a series of tweets with the names, photos, times, and locations these girls were last seen. Twitter users, such as @BlackMarvelGirl, have also joined in to increase efforts to help spread the word and gather support for the families of the girls. 
On March 23, The Associated Press obtained a letter sent by Congressional Black Caucus chairman Cedric Richmond and Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the D.C. in Congress. In the letter, Richmond and Norton urge Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director James Comey to “devote the resources necessary to determine whether these developments are an anomaly or whether they are indicative of an underlying trend that must be addressed.” 
Sessions was briefed on the issue last Friday and is reportedly looking into it.
Though efforts have increased to help find these missing girls, there is still the mystery surrounding the cause of these disappearances. 
D.C. police believe that many of these girls have just run away from home, though they are not certain this applies to all the missing persons cases that have been reported. The National Runway Safeline cites family dynamics, peer and social issues, and abuse as reasons why teens usually run away from home.  
"When children of color go missing, authorities often assume they are runaways rather than victims of abduction," added Richmond and Norton in their letter. But assuming that these girls have acted of their own agency, rather than being kidnapped by someone else who wishes to harm them, leads to a lack of urgency that can be the difference between life or death if their cases do turn out to be abductions. If the people meant to keep them safe assume the girls are simply rebelling, they may not take the immediate, appropriate steps to return them to their families. Furthermore, the continuous lack of attention and downplaying of the situation in the media may even prolong the problem, as public awareness can be an important source of pressure in finding missing persons.
Apart from running away from home, Sharece Crawford, a member of an Advisory Neighborhood Commission in Southeast Washington, believes that these girls could also be victims of sex trafficking, a practice which has a dark history in D.C.
In 2016, around 70 defendants were prosecuted in federal and D.C. courts for charges of conducting human trafficking, including abducting or enticing a child into prostitution, over the span of eight years. Many of the defendants were convicted, but this still remains a major issue in the area. 
Police have denied that human trafficking is to blame for the cases though many people following these disappearances have not ruled it out entirely.
Girls disappearing is a serious problem going on in D.C., and there are still young girls missing whose families are longing to see them again. D.C. police are now urging people to share missing person fliers to raise more awareness for these girls, but the initial inequality in media representation prevented the world from noticing and responding to the situation sooner. Now, the most important thing is that these girls are acknowledged and found — they are no less worth saving, or talking about, as missing white women and football jerseys. They have been ignored long enough.

Imagine seven billion apples. It’s an odd request, I know, but stick with me. What can you tell someone about those apples?
Well, probably that they’re all fruits, that most of them have stems, and that they pretty much all have seeds. But what do they taste like? Aside from the obvious answer (they taste like apples), it’s difficult to really describe what each apple is like. But you can probably say that Granny Smith apples are sourer, that gala apples are sweeter, and that red delicious apples taste like dust and regret.
The human brain is very bad at conceptualizing really large numbers. When we have to think about large numbers of objects and then describe these objects, we usually do so by grouping them. Grouping allows us to deal with smaller numbers, and we tend to believe that, if something has one trait in common with another, then there’s a higher likelihood of those things having another trait in common; sweet apples are better for eating, sour apples are better for cooking, and so on.
The same applies to how we think about other people. There are, after all, over seven billion people on this planet, and the likelihood that you personally know more than a couple hundred of them is fairly small. So, in our eternal quest to understand everyone around us, we often assign general characteristics to groups of similar people. One of the most common ways of grouping people in this manner is by race.
In the last issue of The Tartan, staffwriter Brandon Schmuck wrote about the racism — or lack thereof — in sexual and romantic racial preferences. He argued that these racial preferences may or may not be racist, but that it depends on the person, as “the reasons for an individual’s [race-based] sexual preferences are as diverse as the communities they make up.” While it is true that there are as many motivations behind personal inclinations as there are people, it is wrong to claim that racial preferences are not inherently racist.
This is not to say that anyone in an interracial relationship is viewing their partner through a racist lens. But an individual relationship is an entirely different thing from a generalized preference, because racial preferences aren’t about individual people. They’re explicitly about a group. When someone says they prefer one racial group, it’s usually because of some trait that they believe the vast majority of the members of that group have in common. If someone is attracted to the group defined as “Asian women,” that person is implying that their attraction is to some trait correlated to race. It implies that almost everyone of that race has that characteristic or trait.
This is a generalization based off of race — the definition of a racial stereotype. It’s the “why” behind “I prefer Asian women.” It doesn’t matter if it’s a bad “why” (because they’re more submissive, maybe) or a good “why” (because they’re smarter or cleverer or something similar). Schmuck decries “the unjust generalization of an entire population’s preferences,” but the real unjust generalization is the one we as a culture have been complicit in for a very long time; it’s assuming things about people just because of their race. It’s racism.
Schmuck makes another argument in his article, namely that the aforementioned reality of racial preferences being racist should be open to debate. He writes that comments explaining that racial preferences are a product of and contribute to systematic bias and thus are part of systemic racism “oversimplify the issue, assume the thoughts of others, [and] provide the same destructive type of thinking as the mentioned so-called systematic racism.”
In no way do I believe that just pointing out the racism in racial preferences will end racism or change anyone’s internal thoughts. But sharing a racist thought or opinion in a public forum with the expectation people will respect your “right” to share that thought doesn’t engender discussion or spark debate — all it does is reinforce the systemic racism that probably caused the thought in the first place. And it’s that reinforcing of marginalization, not anyone’s personal bigotry, that is the problem. Wanting respect for the idea that racial preferences aren’t racist is like wanting respect for the belief that the earth is flat; it’s asking respect for being wrong.
Schmuck’s argument is that people should have the ability to state whatever opinion they have on a public forum without having to worry about any explosive repercussions to that opinion. That everyone has a right to say what they want on Overheard, and that the people who contradict any “unpopular” opinion are trying to silence discussion.
Carnegie Mellon is a private institution. Overheard, on top of that, is a privately operated group affiliated with, but not run by, that institution. No one is trying to censure the right to free speech on Overheard — because no one actually has that right in this forum of conversation. Overheard at Carnegie Mellon is not the federal government. There is no right to free speech on Overheard. The legal right to share an opinion is equally as valid as the right to ignore it or shut it down.
But what about moral rights?
We should, after all, try our best to be open-minded. To close ourselves off to opinions we disagree with is to isolate ourselves from the realities of society and culture. If we frame ourselves as people who value the input and voices of others, are we not hypocritical if we shun any voice, even those we believe are probably wrong?
In his article, Schmuck quotes Ayn Rand: “Love is the expression of one’s values.” If Rand is to be believed, then who and what we love is based on the parts of them or it that we value. The valuing of a trait linked with race causes a racial preference. What value causes a wish for a “political bubble” free world?
Perhaps it is caused by the valuing of an idealized world where any and all opinions and thoughts can be shared freely and openly, no matter who they offend or affect.The valuing of a world where people can share opinions without having to care if they hurt or offend someone; a world where the empowerment and protection of marginalized people is less important than one person’s right to make a Facebook post.
Consider this: if your voice has to be shut down by an individual person, it is because society deemed your voice worthy of listening to in the first place. Why are so many possibly racist opinions being shunned now? Because racism has had a vocal, ardent, and even lauded voice for over a century. It is only recently that a voice strong enough to oppose that has been able to exist.
At the end of his article, Schmuck expresses discontent with the fact that “the university — a symbol of free thought and discovery — has become a political bubble, where people are so afraid of breaking political correctness that they are now afraid to speak their minds.” Whether or not this university is in a political bubble doesn’t matter, because a place where degrading and offensive opinion have free reign is a political bubble.
A place without “political correctness” is a place where people can make statements that offend people without having to contend with that offense, where one person’s opinion on a matter of fact must be taken as seriously as that fact itself. That world is a political bubble — it’s just the patriarchal, racist bubble that we are only now starting to replace with a “bubble” built on basic human respect.
The belief that racial preferences aren’t inherently racist is not a “voice less heard.” It’s just another bad apple in the usual bigoted bunch.

One of the biggest stories of the 2016 Presidential Election was the “white working class voter”. Though part of the Democratic Party’s historic coalition, this block of voters has migrated away from Democrats towards Republicans over the past several decades, and they turned hard for Donald Trump in 2016. In the three most surprising states that Trump won — Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania — a dramatic surge of support among the white working class helped propel Trump to victory nationwide. Over spring break, I spoke with voters in neighboring Westmoreland County to better understand why voters in Western PA sided with Trump, and what Democrats need to do to win them back. 
The story of Westmoreland County’s morphing political affiliation is the story of changing politics across the “Rust Belt” writ large. Over the past fifty years, Westmoreland County has shifted from total Democratic domination to a Republican stronghold. Westmoreland voters sided with Lydon B. Johnson by a stunning margin of seventy-two percent to twenty-eight percent in 1964. During the ‘80s and ‘90s, elections were much closer, but the county still leaned reliably blue. Even in 1984, when Ronald Reagan won 525 Electoral College votes and won the popular vote by nearly twenty percent, Westmoreland County voters favored Walter Mondale by six points. But Westmoreland County has voted for every Republican presidential candidate since 2000, with an increasing margin in each election. In 2016, Trump bested Hillary Clinton by more than thirty points, the largest margin of victory in the county since Johnson in 1964. 
So what prompted such a dramatic change? Looking at the county’s election returns, one important inflection point appears to be the tenure of President Bill Clinton. In 1992, Clinton won in Westmoreland County by nearly fifteen points. But in 1996, Clinton won by a razor-thin margin: just one point. Notably, no Democratic candidate has won Westmoreland County since. Though Clinton’s tenure was good to Westmoreland County residents — unemployment there was 9.3% when Clinton took office in 1993 and just 5.1% when he was re-elected in 1996 — voters were repelled by his policies on free trade, entitlement reform, and social issues. 
When I spoke to voters in Westmoreland County, they frequently named three factors that explain why so many historic Democrats have jumped ship since the Clinton days. These factors were jobs, a perception that the Democratic party is “elite” and “out of touch” with working people, and a widening gulf between the values of Westmoreland County residents and the Democratic party. 
It’s not surprising that so many voters pointed to jobs as a major reason for Trump’s success and the Republican Party’s growing dominance in Westmoreland County. After all, this was a narrative repeated across the country in 2016. Voters didn’t necessarily like all of the things Trump stood for, but they trusted him to bring back jobs. I pointed out to several voters that Democrats have had a better record of creating jobs than Republicans, both nationwide and in Westmoreland County. They responded by saying that the jobs Democrats were creating weren’t the right kind of jobs. On the one hand, they were creating low-paying jobs without benefits, such as part-time jobs in the service industry that pay minimum wage. On the other hand, they were focusing on jobs that required a college education or even an advanced degree. Neither is right for Westmoreland County, voters insisted, where jobs in manufacturing, steel, and other heavy industries were once the lifeblood of the economy, but have since all but dried up.
“Trump,” one voter said, “is a businessman who knows how to get things done, and that includes creating good jobs.” Bill, a Clinton voter, put it more bluntly: "Twenty-five years ago there were over 40 thousand mill jobs in the community, and now there’s less than four hundred. Those jobs aren’t coming back because of automation. But a person like Donald Trump is going to promise you everything and the moon. And voters in this area bought it.” 
Beyond factors like job creation, Westmoreland County voters tended to say that Democrats were out-of-touch with working people. One man I spoke too, a Trump voter, said that Clinton did so poorly in Westmoreland County, first and foremost, because she never campaigned there. “In this election,” he said, “Democrats didn’t even pretend to care about workers in Westmoreland County, so why would they vote for her?” Bob, another Trump voter who used to vote for Democrats but switched in 1996, said Democrats have lost voters in Westmoreland County because “Democrats put themselves above everyone else, saying, 'we’re gonna run everything, you take it or leave it.'” Even Democrats said that their party’s candidates struggled with elitism and didn’t do enough to relate to people. Until they do, voters on both sides of the aisle said, Westmoreland County workers aren’t coming back into the Democratic fold. 
While jobs and the economy were far-and-away the dominant reason that voters cited for Trump’s appeal in Westmoreland County, social issues like immigration and abortion loomed heavily in the discussion as well. One woman, an accountant who voted for Donald Trump, said that her vote ultimately came down to abortion. She said she plans to vote for Senator Bob Casey in 2018, a pro-life Democrat. I also spoke to several retirees who said that the last Democrat they voted for was John F. Kennedy in 1960, but they never even considered voting for Democrats since Roe. v. Wade. Trump voters also cited illegal immigration, often saying that his emphasis on building a wall along the southern border and deporting undocumented residents was one of the first promises that attracted them to his campaign during the Republican primary. 
While many who I spoke to — Trump and Clinton voters — said that a populist Democrat with a strong economic message like Bernie Sanders would have done better with Westmoreland County voters, it wasn’t clear whether economic policies that were further to the left would actually increase support in the county. Though many voters signaled that they voted against Clinton because they didn’t trust her or feel that she had their best interests at heart, they often said that liberal economic policies, such as stricter regulations, generous welfare plans, and high taxes, were among the factors that had turned area residents away from the Democratic Party in general. Donna, a Trump voter and registered Democrat, said, “Democrats are losing their base because so many people who are going out to work are sitting back and looking at the entitlement programs and saying ‘We’re paying for this?’ and ‘It’s not working, we need to try something different.’”
So what kind of candidate or platform do Democrats need to run to win back voters in Westmoreland County and across the rust belt? Nearly every Trump voter with whom I spoke said that they’ve voted for Democrats before and would do so again for the right candidate. Voters agreed that the only Democrat that can win in the area is one who emphasizes jobs and the economy and makes a real effort to connect with voters at a personal level. Democratic social issues were a non-starter, but if a candidate focused on how they could create jobs, most voters were willing to listen, even if that candidate didn’t share all of their social values. Most importantly, the Democratic candidate that can beat Trump and other Republicans will have to be authentic, probably an outsider with working class honesty, a strong leader, and a fresh, independent thinker who’s willing to buck party norms to serve the people. A change agent. A leader after the worker’s own heart.

You’re walking to a beach with crystal clear water and white sands, when you look over to your best friend and say, “I can’t wait to sit on the beach and code.” This sounds like something straight out of a cartoon parodying the little to no work-life balance at a university like Carnegie Mellon, but sadly, this was one of many posts that involved coding, working, or anything far from a conventional spring break.
Because of Spring Break, the majority of students were away from Overheard at Carnegie Mellon for the week, partying with friends, relaxing on the beach, or coding their hearts away. This resulted in little to no controversies this week, so instead, I look to address a cultural issue that is prevalent in the posts of those that did spend their Spring Break on Overheard.
It’s a common misconception that the more hours we work, the more that we get done. By this logic, if one is looking to maximize their semester, it would make sense to work through the entire Spring Break and progress ahead of peers that are wasting time on a sunny beach. However, numerous studies have concluded that taking time for relaxation and vacation actually increases the amount of work that we can get done. In 2006, Ernst & Young, a multinational professional services firm, found that for each additional 10 hours of vacation time that their employees took, those employees actually performed better at work and supervisor ratings increased 8 percent. These vacation days keep employees happy, less burnt-out, and rested up for their return. In the same ways that they improved the employees’ performance, Spring Break relaxation can improve the performance of burnt-out Carnegie Mellon students.
This misconception that more work equals more productivity has an economic cost on the nation as a whole. According to an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development study, despite having more than 30 mandated vacation days per year, employees in both Germany and France are more productive than their American counterparts. In other words, they are working fewer days and getting more done. America is infamous for the lack of vacation days taken by its citizens, but utilizing more of their vacation days for relaxation and outside experiences would actually result in an increase in the country’s happiness and result in more productive work hours.
Extending beyond the productivity argument, several research studies, including one from San Francisco State University, have concluded that people were happier when they spent money on experiences rather than material possessions. One’s happiness is arguably one of the most important things in life. In addition to making them more productive, happiness results in a more fulfilling, meaningful life with purpose. If you spend more time traveling, having meaningful experiences, and just enjoying life outside of work, you’ll have an all-around more enjoyable life than if you are striving to maximize the money you make every day and your material profits.
During Spring Break, you should leave that computer in the room and replace your interactions with it with interactions with other people. Whether an introvert or extrovert, there are clear health benefits to human interaction. As psychologist Susan Pinker states, “If you see people face to face, there’s a biological cascade of events that happens, and we’re finding out that these biological events, such as hormones that are released, help to protect your health.” She argues that there are clear health benefits from social interactions, such as the fact that men with intimate relationships “are better protected by their social relationships than they are by medication after a heart attack or stroke,” and that spending more time with others can actually increase one’s lifespan. By nature, humans are social beings. Close relationships with others are one of the most fulfilling and beneficial things that can be achieved in life and can even extend one’s lifespan.
As a self-proclaimed workaholic, I’m not saying that you should not work. Work is important and leads to achieving goals that can impact those around you and leave you with fulfillment that you could not find anywhere else. However, experiences, social interactions, and vacations are important to self-fulfillment and living happy lives. Your productivity is not a function of the hours that you work, and you may find that by giving a few days (or even just a few hours) to yourself, you’ll come out happier, more productive, and more ready to tackle your next challenge.

Dear Fellow White Person,
You are racist. Maybe you are a perfectly nice person. Maybe you have twenty friends of color. Maybe you treat people of color the same way you treat white people. Maybe your life is terrible and difficult on a daily basis. But you are racist, I am racist, we are all racist.
This is not name-calling or a judgment of your character. You probably didn’t choose to be racist — you were probably born into it — yet, here you are, and you contribute to racial oppression. Racial oppression is not just composed of obvious individual acts. Rather, it is primarily a system of small, subtle interactions that we, as white people, might not notice contribute to a greater picture unless we are really paying attention. Whether we realize it or not, we all play a role in these systems, and it is high time that we started paying attention.
It’s not about what you do — it’s about how your actions are received. A white person with a “thing for Asian chicks" may ostensibly be attracted to Asian women because of their physical characteristics, but the why of it doesn’t change the fact that this type of fetishism adds to the oppression of Asian women. We, as white Americans, treat Asian women like exotic foreigners, denying them the status of "real Americans" even if they and their families have lived in the United States for generations. Additionally, as Rachel Kuo describes in her article "5 Ways 'Asian Woman Fetishes' Put Asian Women in Serious Danger," the media perpetuates a stereotype that Asian women are more sexually submissive than other women. This the stereotype is not just limited to movies and TV shows  — Kuo suggests that a common reason white Americans often find Asian women attractive is due to a subconscious internalization of the stereotype. She argues that the stereotype is dangerous, as Americans expect Asian women to be submissive even in the face of abuse and mentions that up to a whopping 61 percent of Asian women in the U.S. experience intimate partner abuse at some point in their lifetimes.
No matter how well-meaning you may think you are, you can't prove the exact reason for something as subconscious as a sexual preference. And even if you could, singling out Asian women as more attractive because of their race is still racist, because doing so has the same effects as other individuals doing so and goes right along with a system that fetishizes Asian women to less innocent ends. At best, fetishizing Asian women makes them feel othered and objectified, and at worst, it complies with a culture that violently abuses them at higher rates than women of other races.
We have created an environment that is hostile and alienating to people of color. Now that we have finally started to improve the system with socialist programs, such as welfare, that are disproportionately needed by people of color and affirmative action programs so that people of color can (at least sometimes) hope to actually achieve something when they work hard, we still refuse to acknowledge that people of color face extra barriers to success and deny that socialist and affirmative action programs are still necessary for achieving fairness. Instead, when people of color succeed, we attribute their success solely to these programs and tell them they are less smart, less hardworking, and generally less deserving of resources and success than white people are.
It is not a surprise that black people feel like they must constantly work to impress white people just to appear “normal”. The Atlantic recently published a video in which then-President Barack Obama explains how he was able to break through the race barrier and become president of the United States. Obama notes that he is unique as a black person in that he was raised by white people who loved him. This positive personal history with white people allowed him to trust us. Obama argues that most black people struggle with gaining power and prestige in America in a way that he didn’t have to because, for most black people (including his wife, Michelle), walking into a room full of white people inevitably requires the extra work of having to prove oneself that a white person walking into the same room would never be expected to do. The idea that black people have to do an unequal amount of work to achieve success can discourage them from pursuing their dreams as vigorously as Obama was able to. White people don’t even have to do anything to be contributing to racism — if we are not actively validating the talents of people of color, we are forces for oppression in their lives.
Above all, we have the privilege to remain ignorant. If you or I hear a racist joke, we get to decide whether or not to be hurt because the joke doesn’t directly insult our personhood. We’re fortunate enough to have civil debates with truly dangerous people and leave with only our worldview offended. People of color are not so lucky. They don’t get to just opt in and out of oppression. The opposition to racist language is about more than preventing hurt feelings — it’s about opening up the debate to marginalized people whose voices are not traditionally heard and allowing them the same level of comfort in spaces of power that we allow ourselves. It is easy for us to dismiss people of color and their allies as “special snowflakes” when it is not our freedoms up for debate and we are unable to experience firsthand how deeply racism really affects people of color, but we can and must challenge ourselves to do better. When we think that a person of color is overreacting to something we’ve said, we need to realize it means that we aren’t seeing their full perspective and need to educate ourselves more.
In calling out your racism, I am not blaming or insulting you. Rather, the word “racist” is a call to action. We need to recognize the privilege we hold and the power we have to make a difference. As one of the wealthiest and most powerful segments of the country, we are in the best position to dismantle systems of racial oppression, and that starts by making changes in our everyday lives.
We must invite people of color into white spaces of authority with open arms. We need to smile more and initiate more conversations and friendships with people of color, make them feel cared about. We must appreciate everything that people of color do for us and for themselves. We must listen to and believe their stories and elevate their voices. It is our job as white people to call each other out and educate each other on how our actions contribute to systemic oppression as well as recognizing our own problematic behaviors. We can only begin to change these extensive systems if we act together.
Good luck,
Lydia

“Fun comes to die at Carnegie Mellon.” These words are thrown around casually on a pretty regular basis on campus, yet the significance may run far deeper. Whether one takes this statement with a grain of salt or regards it with deep sincerity or anywhere in between, there is no way a student can graduate from Carnegie Mellon University without hearing that phrase — or something to that effect — at least once.
Throughout campus, Carnegie Mellon has sparked conversation by placing posters in various parts that allow students to anonymously respond to a topic pertaining to stress culture. The poster on the first floor of Hunt Library has “CMU Stress Culture Doesn’t Exist. Thoughts?” written in bold capital letters, and responses have been generally negative, ranging from “alternative facts” to “then why does everyone have crippling anxiety?”
Two more posters hung up on the sixth floor of the Gates Hillman Complex opened up dialogue. One asks students for their “thoughts on CMU’s recent mental health initiatives,” which also has an overwhelming number of cynical comments that can be summarized by one response: “what initiatives?”
In no way is mental health an ongoing topic exclusively held here at Carnegie Mellon University. Suicide claims over 1,000 college students' lives annually, and the number of students who have struggled with mental health at least once in their college experience is about forty percent as of 2013,although this may be an underestimate because of barriers such as continued stigma attached to mental health.
Furthermore, that number has more than likely increased since then. Organizations such as Active Minds ravel across the nation stressing to students that seeking help for mental health is a sign of strength. They also work to inform college students about the statistics on student mental health, and potential signs of someone struggling.
Many college campuses have also taken initiative in alleviating this epidemic. Carnegie Mellon has taken a handful of strides such as providing on-campus resources through Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS), making the Mindfulness Room available for students, and hosting Paws to Relax every Wednesday.
Even then, the stress culture on campus has undeniably negatively affected a significant proportion of the student population, and the effects of such actions are not felt as strongly as one would hope.
I am not the first person to say this, nor will I be the last: there is no cure to stress culture.
Stress itself is not inherently bad. The Yerkes-Dodson Law shows that having either too little stress or having excessive amounts of stress diminishes one’s performance and a moderate amount of stress — the “sweet spot” — can actually lead to optimal performance. Stress gives us the incentive to reach our full potential and to accomplish what we do.
However, when students turn this stress into a competition where they try to reach a status based on minimal hours of sleep and amount of credits per semester, we reach the polar opposite end of the spectrum. Students stop taking care of their physical and mental well-being, thus diminishing their potential performance. Their heart is no longer in the work; their heart is solely in wanting to outperform others.
Unfortunately, self-care is not sunshine and rainbows like it is often made out to be. Neither does it stop at making short-term on-campus treatment more accessible by extending CaPS’ operating hours and opening an additional location, although that is undeniably a big step in the right direction. However, the new move for open dialogue around mental health is an effort worth noting and one that may lead us closer to finding a better environment that can challenge students but ensure that they put their physical and mental well-being as their top priorities.
