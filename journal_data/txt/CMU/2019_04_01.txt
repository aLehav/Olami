This is Penalty Shouts, The Tartan’s sports column inspired by the The New Yorker’s column Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled column will focus on anything and everything funny in the sports world that is deserving of our comedic attention.
In light of the controversy surrounding Super Smash Bros Melee not being included at Evo 2019, it's time to bring up one of the biggest failures of Nintendo’s smash hit series: not having Waluigi participate. Many fans were heartbroken when news broke that Waluigi was merely an assist character, not an actual playable character, in the most recent installment of the series, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. This resulted in a flurry of memes criticizing this crime against humanity. A classic, a legend like Waluigi was excluded from the list of playable characters, but the purposefully tepid Wii Fit trainer gets in?
As someone who began to understand the glory of Waluigi after leaving the Bible Belt in 2016 and consequently became Waluigious once entering college, I quickly realized the great extents to which our true savior, Waluigi, is not recognized for his great contributions to mankind. He singlehandedly put Milo Yiannopoulos, a journalist who rose to the public eye in great thanks to the Gamergate controversy that rose in 2014, more than $2 billion in debt. When was the last time you shouted "Hallelujah!" after your program finally ran smoothly? Now, when's the last time you've exclaimed "Wah-llelujah?" Thought so myself.
It is time that we appreciate Waluigi with the same great zeal and energy that we do for our favorite athletes or sports teams. The memes regarding the injustice of his availability in Ultimate is not enough. Those ran its course, and the problem has been ignored as memes come and go. However, the injustice continues. Vice News has yet to come forward with an apology for insulting Waluigi, claiming he is a "terrible character that’s become a garbage internet meme and he is creatively and morally bankrupt" in a boldly titled article, "Counterpoint: F**k Waluigi, He Doesn’t Deserve to Be in the New ‘Smash Bros.’"
"Garbage internet meme" and "morally bankrupt" my butt cheek. Think of how many scandals or wrongdoings that Waluigi has had: none. Racist or sexist tweets since 2009? None. Sexual assault allegations? None. Ready to defeat fascism and advocate for social justice? Yes and yes. Look at how he overthrew Yiannopoulos; he demonstrated that there are consequences for wrongdoings and being a needless edgelord who is the human equivalent of a cheap jump scare in a "horror" film. Who else, other than Waluigi, could help unite people regardless of the political spectrum and lead people by putting morals over political parties? I think you know the answer by now.
Waluigi is a god among men. An unsung hero. As Smash continues to be popular in the realm of Esports, let us take a moment to acknowledge the need for change. The people don't want to support a franchise that allows a tax-evading dinosaur or a grey-area libertarian when the counterpart of the latter is not allowed as a playable character. It's really quite simple. The people don't even want the cliche "world peace" or "cure to my crippling depression."
Only wah.

When I started springboard diving eight years ago, I had the same attitude about the sport as any beginner would: I just wanted to get better. I wanted to do more flips, make smaller splashes on my entries, improve my toe-point, deepen my hamstring flexibility, and, in general, be a more graceful person. I stretched at home, did ab workouts, and even attended ballet classes for a few months, imagining my future self gliding down the diving board with elegant, hyperextended legs and perfect posture. 
Over the years I made nearly all of those improvements, except for the elegant legs. I’ve competed at the national level in high school and college, and have been around thousands of other divers, both in the pool and out. It’s a sport based on aesthetics, so you tend to notice the visuals.
I gradually saw other divers who just looked better than me in the air, and at some point accepted that my physiology was such that I would never look that good. I never questioned what exactly it was that separated them from me, or why it mattered. I just knew we were different, and that they had better diving bodies.
The ugly details of this mindset and the tradition that allowed it to happen didn’t become apparent until a year ago, at a pre-championship practice. My teammate absolutely crushed a dive much better than he usually does, and my coach responded by saying “Great dive! Probably a seven.” She didn’t offer any criticism because it was so much better than his previous attempts at the same dive that night. I congratulated him when he got out of the water, but he was frustrated by the fact that she hadn’t given him any feedback.
“If it’s not a ten, I want to know what I can do to make it a ten,” he said as if that were obvious. I realized at that moment that I had become too passive in my relationship to diving scoring. The fact that it wasn’t obvious to me just goes to show how deeply ingrained my assumptions behind scoring had become. Without realizing it, I had allowed a dichotomy to form in my brain among divers: those who looked, walked, and moved like “real divers,” and those who didn’t. There were no specific criteria for these labels, but I unconsciously categorized people after watching them dive three or four times. 
In my mind, it went without saying that my teammate and I were among the latter group, for similar but not the same reasons. For the rest of practice, I thought about what might help him get a ten. Some of those things were innocent enough — albeit long-term investments — like better toe-point and more “flourish” during transitional parts of the dive. Both of those apply to me as well. 
Other things were more problematic: while he wasn’t overweight by any measure, perhaps if his belly was smaller, or his butt didn’t stick out so much, he could get higher scores. Finally, based on years of being scored and watching other divers be scored, I realized that his hair — his awesome, nonwhite, kinky hair which he hadn’t cut since the seventh grade — might have been preventing him from getting that perfect ten.
What does hair have to do with how well somebody is able to perform a dive? It doesn’t. It has to do with anglo-centric beauty norms and the way those norms sneak into judging criteria.
Competitive springboard diving is regulated by FINA, the world’s largest aquatic sports governing body. Nearly every national diving organization across the globe derives its rulebook in some way or another from the FINA diving manual, which devotes an entire section to judging bias. The organization makes its values clear in this section: 
“Biased judging is an offense against the concept of sportsmanship and fair competition.”  In this section, FINA thoroughly addresses both conscious and subconscious bias, concluding by urging judges to ask themselves “Am I judging the dive or the diver? Am I judging what I see or what I expect to see?”
The same manual also stipulates that judges should award a dive based on their “overall impression” of it, and uses phrases like “aesthetically pleasing,” “ungraceful,” and “awkward” to detail point deductions. Given the 10-second timeframe in which judges are expected to score a dive, vague terms like these become subject to the viewer’s instincts. And if, as it appears, many judges associate “aesthetically pleasing” with short hair and more slender features, they will probably deduct some points simply for looking different.
I’ve been in diving long enough to know that subjectivity is a part of it and that, in some cases, it allows people with truly unique styles to be rewarded for their artistry. But the language of judging needs to change to either eliminate the vagueness or explicitly prohibit judging based on cosmetics. There shouldn’t be systematic barriers to getting that perfect ten.

As the hockey season winds down and the baseball season heats up, the Penguins find themselves in a playoff battle and the Pirates find themselves battling the weather. The professional sports teams in Pittsburgh are at some of the most fun points in their seasons, with the playoffs coming up and Opening Day just finishing, so there's plenty to discuss.
After Friday night's loss to the Nashville Predators, the Pittsburgh Penguins are two points ahead of the Carolina Hurricanes in the Metropolitan Division. On Sunday night, the Penguins face off against the Hurricanes in an important playoff battle. Both teams have yet to clinch a playoff spot as the season winds down into its last few games, and the Hurricanes are just two points away from missing the Stanley Cup playoffs, while the Penguins are only four points away. If the Penguins lose two in a row, they could find themselves on the outside looking in. 
Alternatively, the game is also a battle for seeding in the Cup. As it stands, neither team will play the Tampa Bay Lightning in the first round, but with the little bit of seeding fluctuation that will go down in the last few games, the Penguins could find themselves up against the best team in the NHL in the first round. Going up against the Lightning, who have a chance to break the record for most wins in a single season, is not a place any team wants to find themselves. 
In good news for the Penguins, Evgeni Malkin has returned to practice with contact restrictions. Malkin is unlikely to return to the lineup for the rest of the season after suffering an injury to his upper body from a cross-check by former teammate Robert Bortuzzo. Malkin has been sidelined since March 16. Coach Mike Sullivan hopes that Malkin will return soon according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
Since the hit, Malkin has remained fairly silent, but recently, the Post-Gazette reported that Malkin said it should have been a penalty. He was surprised there wasn't discipline waiting for Bortuzzo, saying it was "a little bit of a dirty play." 
The final four games of the Penguins season begin tonight with the Hurricanes. Afterward, they play the Detroit Red Wings twice in reversed fixtures on Tuesday and Thursday. They end the season on Saturday against the New York Rangers. 
In baseball news, Opening Day has come and gone. The Pittsburgh Pirates' first game was played in Cincinnati last Thursday against the Reds, where the game came down to the wire with a score of 5-3. Pitcher Jameson Taillon earned the Opening Day start but found himself on the losing end of the game after giving up four earned runs on six hits and two walks. However, Taillon was pulled at the beginning of the seventh with two runners on base that scored on a home run allowed by reliever Richard Rodriguez. 
Some of the few bright spots in the game included closer Nick Burdi who struck out the side on 14 pitches, 12 of which were strikes. Jung Ho Kang went one for three at the plate, with the hit scoring two with two outs in the inning. Also, Corey Dickerson hit his first home run of the season in the eighth inning off Raisel Iglesias. 
All of this isn't to say that the Pirates' struggles in the game are going to continue into the season. The third string right fielder, Melky Cabrera, started the game as Gregory Polanco and Lonnie Chisenhall are on the 10-day injury list with shoulder and finger injuries, respectively. The core lineup of Dickerson, Josh Bell, and Francisco Cervelli all had a base hit and scored a run, and the end of the lineup all showed potential. They were just unable to string their walks and hits together into runs coming across the plate. 
Ultimately, the game could have gone either way if a pitch or two hit a spot or a batted ball landed in the right place, but it didn't fall that way for the Pirates. 
The next game for the Pirates was postponed due to rain in Cincinnati, but the end of their road series against the Reds comes on Sunday. On Monday, the Pirates open at home against the Cardinals, who have lost twice already this season and won once from Paul Goldschmidt's three-home-run game. The game begins at 1:10 p.m., and the weather is looking like it will be cold, but sunny. After their short two-game stand against the Cardinals, the Reds come to Pittsburgh for a four-game series. It will be the first long term test for the Pirates against a team that has the talent to fight for first place in the NL Central.

Another wild week of basketball has passed, which means there is plenty to catch up on. We’re now preparing ourselves emotionally and physically as the Elite Eight wraps up and the Final Four starts this week. If you missed this past week of dancing, The Tartan is here once again to fill you in.
The quality of this tournament has been superb. No first-seeded teams have had an easy time; Gonzaga has fallen, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was thrashed by Auburn in a 17 point victory. Both Auburn and Texas Tech, who beat Gonzaga, have been able to upset their way to where they are now. Texas Tech is already in the Final Four, and fifth-seeded Auburn plays second seed Kentucky for their spot in the Final Four on Sunday.
Duke has surprisingly had very difficult and close games, and yet, continues to survive them all. It seems that near three minutes before the end of each game, Duke will surely lose, but each time they survive by a missed tip in. This was the case with Virginia Tech’s valiant effort, which ended in the same disappointment as University of Central Florida’s bid last week. For all the Duke haters, including me, it almost feels as if Duke is undeserving of their wins, only coming away on top due to luck. It’ll be Michigan State’s turn to try their hand at stopping Duke.
Purdue and Carsen Edward’s brilliant string of performances finally ended to the University of Virginia. Edwards scored 42 points in their final game and has dropped 29, 42, and 26 points going back to the first game of this tournament. Among his significant achievements is the record for most three-pointers made in the tournament with 28, and the most points in four games, beating previous record-holder Stephen Curry. 
The Virginia game itself was a classic, with a buzzer beater at the end of regulation to send the game into overtime. Virginia closed the game out for the win: a great accomplishment and rebound for a team that lost to the sixteenth seed in the first round last year. 
If more games go down as they have so far, this will continue to be an excellent tournament, so stay on top of it, and we’ll keep you updated too.

You spend hours carefully polishing your resume, cramming in as many action words as you possibly can without going over one page. You get your dress shirt ironed and your suit jacket dry-cleaned, so you look as sharp as possible during the interview. You attend every single possible job fair — even those unrelated to your major — so you can meet as many recruiters as possible. You comb through Glassdoor reviews to see which companies are the best to work for.
And after all that effort, you still have no idea which internship to apply for.
If that sounds like you, then good news! Artificial intelligence and neural networks can now make those daunting, life-changing career decisions for you. Researchers at Universitas Pendidikan Ganesha in Indonesia have recently developed an AI-based recommendation system that can assign students to internship placements that best match their skills and aspirations. To use the system, students must submit information about their skills, grades, aspirations and interests, as well as a personal survey to gauge some of their more subjective traits. With this information, the system can then generate placements, currently with a 95 percent accuracy in test runs comparing predictions to actual placements.
The motivation behind the study is a problem that college students have faced since time immemorial: where do you go work after graduation? With today’s increasingly competitive job market and shortage of available jobs in certain areas, it can be hard for even the most qualified candidates to make it into their preferred profession. The researchers hope that this system will help students find their purpose in life rather than being perpetually mired in a state of unemployment.  
As exciting as this new system is, it is still in development, so you probably won’t be getting advice from a computer any time soon. In the meantime, if you’re having trouble figuring out what your direction in life is, you should check out Carnegie Mellon’s Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC) which is an excellent resource for career assistance. A fulfilling career may be a lot closer than you think, so don’t lose hope!

Sugar is in everything, from fountain drinks to pastries. While sugar might taste sweet, its effects on the human body certainly aren’t. A new study from the Baylor College of Medicine and Weill Cornell Medicine finds that high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), a common sweetener, is directly linked to tumor growth. The study found that consuming a marginal amount of high-fructose corn syrup daily stimulated the growth of intestinal tumors in mice, independent of obesity.
Dr. Jihye Yun, an assistant professor of molecular and human genetics at Baylor University, explained the premise of the study in a press release: “An increasing number of observational studies have raised awareness of the association between consuming sugary drinks, obesity and the risk of colorectal cancer. The current thought is that sugar is harmful to our health mainly because consuming too much can lead to obesity. We know that obesity increases the risk of many types of cancer including colorectal cancer; however, we were uncertain whether a direct and causal link existed between sugar consumption and cancer.”
The researchers began with a special strain of mouse with early-stage colorectal cancer, where the gene that encodes the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein was deleted. Yun explained that “APC is a gatekeeper in colorectal cancer. Deleting this protein is like removing the breaks of a car. Without it, normal intestinal cells neither stop growing nor die, forming early-stage tumors called polyps. More than 90 percent of colorectal cancer patients have this type of APC mutation.”
In order to simulate human consumption of sugary beverages containing HFCS, scientists used sweetened water that contained 25 percent HFCS, the equivalent of a can of soda. They provided the liquid in a water bottle for the mice to drink voluntarily, and the mice quickly gained weight. However, the researchers were aiming to study the effects of the sugar-sweetened beverage independently of obesity. So they transitioned to using a customized syringe to orally feed the mice a small amount of sugary water each day. After just two months, the mice developed tumors that were larger and more dangerous than mice who were treated with unsweetened water.
These results show that when mice have early-stage intestinal tumors, consuming even modest quantities of liquid-form high-fructose corn syrup can seriously accelerate tumor growth regardless of whether the subject is obese. Alarmingly, young adult humans develop early-stage tumors in their intestines randomly and without symptoms. “Further research is needed to translate these discoveries to people,” Yun cautioned. “However, our findings in animal models suggest that chronic consumption of sugary drinks can shorten the time it takes cancer to develop. In humans, it usually takes 20 to 30 years for colorectal cancer to grow from early stage benign tumors to aggressive cancers.”
According to Dr. Lewis Cantley at Weill Cornell Medicine, the findings explain the rise of colorectal cancers in the United States among 25 to 50-year-olds that coincides with increased consumption of sugary beverages and other foods that contain high-fructose corn syrup.
But what actually causes sugar to promote tumor growth? The team observed that sugary drinks increased the levels of fructose in the mice’s colons and glucose in their blood, which are efficiently absorbed by tumors. In particular, fructose was traced through tumor tissues, as it was chemically altered to enhance the production of fatty acids, which contribute to tumor growth.
While previous research used either fructose or glucose alone to study the link between sugar and cancer, they did not consider how they affect the body in concert. Drinks and foods contain both fructose and glucose in matching amounts; fructose amplifies the role of glucose during the synthesis of fatty acids in tumors. That is the real breakthrough here: the discovery of a direct molecular mechanism that explains the correlation between sugar and colorectal cancers.
On the positive side, Yun says that this research might allow the creation of treatments in the future. Fructose is not essential for the survival of regular cells, so she suggests that “therapies targeting fructose metabolism are worth exploring.” But as always, “avoiding consuming sugary drinks as much as possible instead of relying on drugs would significantly reduce the availability of sugar in the colon.”

The internet has changed many things about how we live our lives. It has altered news, academia, and even social interactions. But, possibly most of all, the internet changed how we consume media. It became faster, easier, and (more importantly) cheaper than ever to find and download the content you were looking for.
That change was due, in part, to the rise of online piracy applications like Napster, Limewire, and sites like Pirate Bay. These file-sharing platforms gave users the opportunity to disseminate free copies of digital media, with little technical knowledge required.
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), combined with numerous lawsuits by content producers, eventually led to the demise of certain sharing services (e.g. Napster and Limewire). Additionally, many institutions and corporations have their own internal procedures for dealing with piracy on their networks. For example, Carnegie Mellon informs students that if they are found pirating following a DMCA notice, said student could have their network access revoked. 
Although such measures, both private and federal, might have curbed piracy somewhat, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), copyright holders, and the government are still fighting that battle. Even with the advent of streaming services, the rise in platform-exclusive content is thought to be responsible for a rise in piracy this past year. 
But there is more to the piracy debate than whether people are pirating or not. In the past week, music labels have turned to blaming ISPs for failing to stop pirates. On March 23, Charter Communications, reportedly the second-largest cable operator in the US, was sued by Sony, Universal, and Warner for failing to disconnect users for alleged copyright infringement violations between March 24, 2013, and May 17, 2016. 
Additionally, the lawsuit states that “Charter's customers are motivated to subscribe to Charter's service because it allows them to download music and other copyrighted content — including unauthorized content — as efficiently as possible.” In other words, it appears that the music labels believe that Charter is enabling piracy by providing faster internet speeds as part of their package tiers.
Now, under DMCA rules, an ISP cannot be held responsible for a customer’s actions. This statement, however, comes with a condition: ISPs are expected to investigate any DMCA notice filed with them, and terminate any user accounts found to be guilty of copyright infringement (or have a similar such policy, where the punishment could include fines instead of outright termination). This is part of why Carnegie Mellon suspends network privileges in response to a DMCA notice. 
The problem comes when an ISP does not pursue a DMCA request and terminate user accounts, as required by the individual label’s copyrights.  And here is where things get dicey for Charter. The lawsuit claims that they have “gone out of [their] way not to take action against subscribers engaging in repeated copyright infringements.” 
If Charter Communications can prove that they “reasonably implemented” a policy to handle repeat infringements, then they might be in the clear. But in the past, music labels have sued other ISPs (including Cox and Grande Communications) for similar reasons — some of which either settled or were ruled in favor of the music labels. But for now, it is up to Charter to prove that they have adhered to their infringement policies.

"Hit you with that ddu du ddu du du!"
The voices of K-pop girl group Blackpink blasted through the speakers in the Tepper Simmons Auditorium, blanketing the venue with an upbeat and vibrant energy. Girls in soft pink Lolita fashion-inspired dresses floated among the many tables, intermingling with the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate tournament players. Filled to the brim with convention and video game enthusiasts, ScottyCon 2019 was a smashing success.
ScottyCon, the first of its kind at Carnegie Mellon, was a multi-organization collaboration: Cosplay@CMU, Artists Alley Club, CMU E-Sports, Game Creation Society, and Vermillion Anime Club all worked together to create an anime and video game convention reminiscent of other conventions like AnimeExpo. Each organization had their own space within the auditorium featuring crafts, trivia games, multiple setups for video game tournaments, and anime screenings, providing a wide variety of fun activities to explore.
Cosplay@CMU hosted a series of activity tables where con-goers could sew their own mini-Scotty dog or sakura flower plushies, or create their own charms using acrylic and markers. Spreading the spirit of cosplay through these fun handmade activities, many a con-goer left with a smile on their face and a plushie in their hand. Nearby was a photobooth setup, complete with an Instagram frame and a collection of colorful props and costumes, where cosplayers could pose for a ScottyCon photo.
Artists Alley Club had set up an alley that featured seven tables of artists: Lauren Zhang, Alyssa, Lexin & Dina, Fenkko + Jaesti, Sophia & Xiang, and Grace + Eileen. Con-goers were able to support their fellow Carnegie Mellon student artists by purchasing fun stickers, beautiful prints, cute charms, and commissions. It was incredibly cool to see the artwork that students here are creating, and to support them directly by buying their art!
CMU E-Sports dominated much of the event space with a variety of video game tournaments. With some table set up for friendly, non-competitive players and others designated specifically for tournament players, the CMU E-Sports tables were crowded with energetic onlookers and players. While Smash Ultimate was the main tournament of the day, players could participate in other competitive video games like Dragon Ball FighterZ, Street Fighter V AE, Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2, and Tekken 7.
Alongside CMU E-Sports’ collection of AAA games was CMU’s Game Creation Society’s collection of impressive student-made video games. The Game Creation Society (GCS) occupied the far end of the auditorium, showcasing video games and current projects made by Carnegie Mellon students that con-goers could help playtest. The biggest draws were the GCS-built upright arcade machine, where con-goers could play a student-made game with classic arcade controls and aesthetics, and a VR area.
Just left from the GCS zone was Vermillion Anime Club’s zone, where they featured a variety of episodic anime screenings throughout the event, as well as a variety of trivia events. If con-goers needed a break from the high-energy tournaments or from simply walking around, they could enjoy episodes of anime like Cowboy Bebop, One Punch Man, Nichijou, or Asobi Asobase.
And if all this wasn’t enough, ScottyCon also hosted smaller competitions, like “Guess the Anime OP” and “K-Pop Random Play Dances.” If attendees got hungry, they could stop by a small snacks table complete with Calpico drinks, Pocky, and Hi-Chews — classic anime and video game convention food. Con-goers also received a small stamp card. If they collected all the stamps from all of the various zones in the convention, they could enter raffles co-hosted with Tekko 2019: mini ones for small prizes, and one with a grand prize of two tickets to Tekkoshocon 2019, Pittsburgh’s premiere Anime, Gaming, Music, Fashion and Japanese Pop Culture Convention (courtesy of Tekko 2019).
All in all, ScottyCon 2019 was an incredibly successful event. All the attendees seemed to really enjoy the smaller-scale AnimeExpo, thanks to the impressive organizational work from the various student organizations involved. Folks from the University of Pittsburgh and the general Pittsburgh area all came to enjoy Carnegie Mellon’s first anime/video game convention, and will hopefully continue to do so in the years to come.

Adventurous. Brave. Daring. Bold. All words describing one man: Arthur Curry, otherwise known as Aquaman. Born as the heir to Atlantis, an underwater kingdom, Arthur (Jason Momoa) must prevent the war between the land and sea.
He grew up with his human father Thomas Curry (Temuera Morrison) after his mother Atlanna, the queen of Atlantis (Nicole Kidman) had to return to the sea for an arranged marriage. After training for years with Nuidis Vulko (Willem Dafoe), he is finally ready to take on the
challenges that await him in the ocean.
Directed by James Wan, this fantastic movie is thrilling in its entirety. From the set design and cinematography to its hair and makeup, this movie has everything. Since its release on Jan. 1, it has since been nominated for a whopping 16 awards.
With all my love for films, I have never been particularly fond of action or fantasy movies. However, this movie caught my attention. With its talented cast and crew, this is truly a fantastic production!
The costume design has to be one of my favorite parts of the production. Bringing the characters to life, these pieces were designed with exact character traits in mind. Many designs were form-fitting, staying true to the superhero realm, but designed in a manner that was spot-on for the type of film. As the characters were primarily underwater, the costume designs
incorporated various elements of the underwater universe; for example, the use of scales or colors similar to that of sea creatures. I found it very impressive.
The cinematography was equally as impressive. The first aspect of this movie that will catch people’s attention is the fact that it is almost entirely underwater. The most amazing thing is, none of it was shot underwater, but the actors were actually attached to wires, leaving audiences thoroughly impressed by the skills and editing process of the movie makers. The vivid colors, landscapes and HD quality of every scene provided a realistic experience for the audience, unlike any other. The creators of the world of Aquaman are truly incredible designers and imagineers, bringing realistic and imaginary animals to life as well as creating a fascinating place far beyond our imaginations.
This movie, with its exciting design elements, thrilling plot, and overall immersive experience is not one to miss! So grab your popcorn, a cozy blanket, some friends, and experience the world that is Aquaman.

This past Saturday, TEDxCMU took place in the Cohon University Center. This year’s theme was Ripple Effect, inspired by Apple CEO Tim Cook’s words, “you want to be the pebble in the pond that creates the ripple for change.” From 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., the seven speakers, 10 TED talks, performances, and Innovation Expo collectively interpreted the theme in diverse ways, allowing the audiences to each take away their unique piece of the ripple to be part of its effect.
The speakers’ topics varied from post-prison rehabilitation to critical design for the minority. Through an app developed specifically for this year’s TEDxCMU, audiences were able to directly post questions to the speaker and receive personalized answers. I posted questions to two speakers and received my answers before the end of the event. Their responses not only helped me umderstand, but also invited me to be part of the event through this interactive experience and be part of the ripple, responsible for reflecting and seeking ways to change the future.
My favorite talk was “Pushing for Consent Education” delivered by Micah Rabin, a senior undergraduate student majoring in Decision Science and International Relations and Politics. Rabin started her talk by breaking our stereotypical association between “consent” and “sex.” She made a clear point that “consent” should be associated with “respect.” Its scope goes far beyond sex or romantic relationships because mutual respect and consent should be applied to all aspects of life. After breaking the taboo around the definition of “consent,” Rabin proposed that consent education should be integrated into early-stage education and even kindergarten curricula. “Kids should grow up with these core values,” she explained, arguing values such as mutual respect, mutual appreciation, and many more are derived from the fundamental comprehension of the concept of mutual consent.
When confronting the issue of sexual harassment, we often argue that instead of teaching our girls how to protect themselves, we should teach our boys how to respect women. Although breaking the status quo is always easier said than done, Rabin’s proposal of regarding consent as a core value in order to let kids understand their autonomy over their own bodies could change the mindset of the next generation. They would start with rejecting their aunts’ request of kissing their cheeks as six-year-olds, then after they grow up, respecting the line drawn by mutual consent would be instinctual.
Another interesting aspect of this year’s TEDxCMU was that it presented talks with core beliefs almost conflicting with each other. Rana Sen gave a talk titled “How Smart Cities are Technology for the People, by the People,” in which he focused on explaining the positive impact of innovation and cutting-edge technology on the lives of urbanized residences. Even considering the practical accessibility of a technological solution, we can easily recognize that not everyone in the city population would be able to receive its benefit; Sen chose to focus on the influence it would bring to the fortunate group who would be able to attain access.
However, a few talks afterward, Deepa Butoliya delivered the talk “Design Through the Lens of Jugaad.” Jugaad is a Hindi word that means quick-fix, which she closely associated with the impoverished people’s struggle to get by. She stated that classic design would never target the people with severely limited resources, so the people themselves utilized the concept of jugaad to find cheap and quick-fixes for their problems. Butoliya then proposed that designers should “design through the lens of jugaad,” creating less market-oriented products, but real ones that present solutions for problems of those in need. If we place Sen and Butoliya on a spectrum, they would definitely be standing at the opposite ends — Sen pushing the frontend, Butoliya pulling the backend. Although contrasting, both presented eye-opening ways to push the society forward, and both were “ideas worth sharing.”
Leaving the event, I wonder how many people would take away a piece of it, internalizing at least one idea. After years, maybe one of these people would reference back to this day, to this event and say, “That was where I got my inspiration.”
And the ripple continues on.

Thursday should be author Ned Vizzini’s 38th birthday. He should be celebrating with his wife, Sabra Embury, and his seven-year-old son, Felix. Perhaps he would have written more books depicting the hardships of coming-of-age. He definitely would be celebrating his first novel, Be More Chill, hitting Broadway and his most well-known novel, It’s Kind of a Funny Story, entering the process of becoming a musical.
Unfortunately, Vizzini died by suicide in late 2013 at age 32. From a complete outsider’s perspective, he had everything going for him. His professional career as a writer was taking off. All but the final number for the musical adaptation for Be More Chill was completed. In addition to his musicals, he was also writing for TV shows like Teen Wolf. However, scratch beneath the surface and you see that, as Embury recalled, “everything was clicking, he’s getting everything he wanted, then at some point, things shifted.”
Even to those who knew about his struggles with mental health, his death came as a surprise. Novelist and Scholastic vice president Dave Levithan, who had been friends with Vizzini since 2004, expressed the disbelief he felt, saying “it was just something we did not see coming ... we were always in awe, because he started writing in his teens, and we thought he was going to be writing into his 80s.”
Edison Price Vizzini, known as Ned Vizzini, was a young adult author who effectively captured the struggles of adolescence. His first novel, Be More Chill, follows Jeremy Heere, a socially awkward high schooler, who tries to get the attention of theatre-fanatic Christine with the help of a magic pill that helps him say and do all the right things. In 2015, the book became an off-Broadway musical written by composers Joe Tracz and Joe Iconis. Just this March, the musical hit Broadway’s Lyceum Theater. Additionally, the book is also having a film adaptation in the works.
Although Vizzini was excited about the thought that Be More Chill would become a musical, he, unfortunately, never got to listen to any part of it. “He never heard anything from the show, which is the weirdest, saddest thing,” Iconis states. The final number, “Voices in My Head,” was the only one that had not been started prior to Vizzini’s death. After learning this, it seems impossible to not hear this song almost as a tribute to Vizzini. Iconis stated that he and Tracz wanted something that “feels reflective and a little bit more human.” “Voices in My Head” is acoustic, contrasting a bit from the more synthetic poppy beats from the other numbers, yet it meshes well with the rest of the musical.
The musical also left a subtle yet powerful tribute to Embury that did not go unnoticed. In the scene where Jeremy picks up the pill in a Payless store, he gets it in a box labeled “SABRAS by Pinkerton.” “Sabras,” is a reference to Sabra Embury; “Pinkerton” references Weezer’s Pinkerton, an album that the couple enjoyed.
Vizzini’s most notable novel is perhaps It’s Kind of a Funny Story. In the novel, Vizzini tells his five-day experience in a psychiatric hospital through the character of Craig Gilner, whose experience of the pressure of a prestigious high school pushes him to suicidal ideation. Even for those not struggling with mental illness, many readers will find at least some component of the novel relatable. Vizzini truly was a talented author. Despite writing about such a grave topic, he manages to do so in a way that doesn’t feel heavy. He infuses the story with hope while accurately capturing mental illness, and hooks the reader in without romanticizing the realities of living with depression.
The movie adaptation that was released in 2010 failed to capture Vizzini’s unique voice. However, the novel’s musical adaptation is currently in the works, something I doubt that Vizzini could have ever imagined. He was surprised when Iconis and Tracz called him to discuss Be More Chill’s theatrical potential; having another novel become a musical probably would have been within reach. Tony nominee Alex Brightman and composer Drew Gasparini signed a deal with Universal Studios to do just that. The musical was performed in Feinstein’s/54 Below in New York City in 2017.
It’s heartbreaking that someone so brilliant and clever left the world too soon. However, his life left an indelible impact on many. He taught his readers that it’s okay to not be okay; that life is filled with hardships, but also joy worth fighting for. He vocalized the feelings of hopelessness and awkwardness for those who couldn’t find the words to express these frustrations. Even when writing about the darkest parts of life, he could still find a way to make a reader laugh. He never got to see two of his books come to life on the stage, but I’m sure that he would be more than proud.

This week, a small, Japanese film named Shoplifters will be screening in McConomy Auditorium. 
The film follows a family of petty thieves who take in a little girl they find outside in the cold. This was one of the very best films to come out last year and was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars this year. Everything about this film is near perfection. The performances from everyone are stellar, with the child actors even delivering performances on the level of seasoned actors. The cinematography was gorgeous. The story itself is so deep and nuanced. Each character has a complicated profile and their relationships are all portrayed so honestly. It felt like I was following a real family, watching their relationships develop and be tested. And it was a treat to watch. The direction from Hirokazu Kore-eda, who is one of Japan’s best directors, is sublime and subtle, and every choice he makes is apt for the story he is telling. It’s a breathtakingly intimate film that sucks you into the world and never lets you go, with great commentary about the struggles of the lower class in Japan. I highly recommend this film to everyone. It’s an excellent small film that deserves all the viewers it can get.

Welcome to Maddy's Monthly Meme Madness, where we take a look at the Top 5 most-liked memes on Carnegie Mellon Memes for Spicy Teens posted in a month.
This was technically posted in Feb. 28, but because it was posted after the publication of the previous Monthly Meme Madness roundup, I'll let this slide. This is too painfully accurate and a spicy use of the "let me in" meme. It almost makes hunting for internships bearable. Almost.
Oh yes, Hoverboard 2: Electric Boogaloo... I mean the electric longboard. I thought that "hoverboards" phasing out meant that we as a society evolved. Apparently not if we have electric longboards in 2019. Lightning McQueen is tastefully cropped into the meme. He isn't perfectly photoshopped into the sidewalk in front of Doherty Hall; there are rough edges from the race track of the original meme. This adds to the imperfect beauty of memes. Much like life, memes are imperfect, messy, and lack rhyme or reason. However, it pains me to see that this meme is not cropped. Even if life is a chaotic mess, crop your memes.
Congrats Yordnoff for yet again being featured in our Monthly Meme Madness. This is another strong meme that virtually any Carnegie Mellon student can relate to. Imposter syndrome seems to be a mandatory component of the Carnegie Mellon experience, as this meme effectively captures. The lil' Scotty adds a fantastic finishing touch.
Punny. Very punny. May this meme give us the prestigious internships at places like SpaceX that we so yearn for.
'Tis that time of year: massacring the grass on the CFA lawn for the purpose of Carnival festivities. Even without Carnival, the lawn resembles more of a mudslide than an actual lawn; I'm surprised that there are any blades of grass left to destroy.

In 11 years, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has become more than just a series of films — it’s a brand, a culture, a movement, and a trailblazing force within the entertainment industry. It has transformed the careers of downtrodden has-beens or turned unknowns into international superstars. It instigated all of the many attempted cinematic universes, from the moderately successful DC Extended Universe to Universal’s done-after-one-film Dark Universe. It has inspired an extremely loyal fanbase that seems to grow every year, and the B-characters from the comics are now household names. The next movie in the MCU is Captain Marvel.
Last year, Black Panther was not only a successful film that made over a $1 billion and was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars, but it also became something more, a symbol and inspiration for representation and telling different kinds of stories. And now, finally, 11 years after Iron Man kicked off the universe in 2008, we finally have the 22nd film of the franchise, a solo film about a female superhero.
Captain Marvel is about Carol Danvers (Brie Larson), a human from Earth who finds herself on the planet Kree at the start of the film, with no memory and mysterious powers. On Kree, she is a member of the Starforce, a special ops group. The Kree, an advanced species ruled by an AI, the Supreme Intelligence, is in constant conflict with the Skrulls, a shapeshifting species.
This extended prologue of her on Kree could be shorter, as the action really only kicks off when she crash lands in a Blockbuster store in Los Angeles. Her appearance prompts S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to arrive, introducing Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) to the story, both de-aged through special effects, and bringing Captain Marvel into the MCU world on screen.
The premise is pretty simple: She is on a mission to find out who she is. There are other characters and plot threads at play, but at its core, this film is her journey to discover who Carol Danvers was and is, but more than that, how she landed on Kree, and where she got her powers. Some critics have said that the character is boring and dull and that the premise drags along. But what are we supposed to expect? The character is a soldier, both in her past on Earth and in the Starforce, trained to be a machine. Her mentor, played by the always charismatic Jude Law, repeatedly tells her to forgo emotion, as it makes her a liability. As for the story itself, there is nothing more interesting than a character figuring out who she is, and who she wants to be.
She is human, she has emotions, and Larson portrays this amnesiac character wonderfully. In the scenes where she begins to learn more about her past, Larson fills the screen with her powerful presence, making the audience feel her conflict, confusion, and loss. Jackson is also great in his biggest role in an MCU film yet. Larson and Jackson have instant chemistry and give the film a buddy-comedy type feel. Ben Mendelsohn as the Skrull Talos also subverts the typical one-note MCU villain trope and gives the character depth.
Marvel hired directing duo Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck to direct Captain Marvel. They are known for their indie dramas like Half Nelson and Mississippi Grind, which have almost a neorealistic tone and quiet character depth. In the characters, Boden and Fleck ably bring Captain Marvel to life, but I was quite disappointed in the action. It’s a superhero film. We come for the characters, but also for great set pieces and standout scenes that we remember years later. Perhaps the film suffers from comparisons to great MCU action scenes in previous movies, but I can’t tell you any of the action in Captain Marvel stands out.
For audience members who grew up in the 90s, this film is for them. I confess some of the music references and culture callbacks either fell flat for me or went completely over my head, but I’m sure another demographic of the general population can appreciate these moments.
Captain Marvel is Marvel’s first solo female film, and it’s a good film. It’s not the franchise’s best film, but it doesn’t have to be. It’s not a culture-changing awards winner like Black Panther, but it wasn’t designed to be. The film juggles so many moving parts: Carol’s backstory and her transformation into Captain Marvel, fleshing out the Kree people (who were introduced in Guardians of the Galaxy) as well as the Skrulls, setting up a lot of connections to the rest of the franchise, particularly the origins of the Avengers, and building threads that will lead straight into Avengers: Endgame, Marvel’s most anticipated film yet, out later this month. Captain Marvel achieves all of this, while delivering a crowd-pleasing film.

“How old was he?” “17!” shouted the crowd gathered on South Highland Avenue, outside of chain restaurant Mad Mex. On the night of March 22, hundreds marched through the streets of East Liberty to protest the acquittal of Michael Rosfeld, a police officer who in June 2018 shot and killed Antwon Rose II, a 17-year-old Woodland Hills high school student.
“Antwon Rose was not a threat!” shouted the crowd as they marched down South Highland Avenue. Chanting “Hands up, don’t shoot!” the group walked down Penn Avenue, a busy four- lane street, with their hands raised. Police blocked traffic and three helicopters circled overhead, echoing.
On June 19, 2018, Officer Michael Rosfeld pulled over a gold Chevy Cruze in East Pittsburgh that matched the description of a vehicle involved in a North Braddock drive-by shooting 13 minutes earlier. As Rosfeld began to arrest the driver of the vehicle, the two passengers exited the back seats and fled. Rosfeld shot Rose three times, hitting him in his face, elbow, and back. Rose was unarmed. Later, authorities found two handguns in the car. Cell phone footage showing the incident was widely shared on social media.
Rosfeld was sworn in to the East Pittsburgh Police Department less than two hours before the shooting occurred. Before that, Rosfeld served as a University of Pittsburgh police officer from Oct. 10, 2012 to Jan. 18, 2018, University of Pittsburgh spokesperson Joe Miksch told PittNews. Rosfeld left the University of Pittsburgh Police Department after controversy following his account of a Dec. 2017 arrest at the Garage Door Salon that did not align with evidence, as reported by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
Rosfeld was charged with first-degree murder, third-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter. The trial began on March 18 and concluded on March 22. The jury deliberated for less than four hours, acquitting Rosfeld of all charges.
In his testimony, Mr. Rosfeld said he believed Rose and the others in the car could have been a danger to the community. He says he fired because he believed one of them had pointed a handgun at him.
When deadly force is used against a fleeing suspected felon, Pennsylvania law justifies law enforcement’s actions if the officer believes it was necessary to prevent death or injury to themselves or others. David A. Harris, a professor of law at the University of Pittsburgh, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that “[police] don’t have to be correct about the presence of the gun,” which he states is “a standard that favors police.”
The night of the acquittal, protestors in East Liberty called for “the laws that justified this murder to be changed.” The leaders of the protest called out, “Is Pittsburgh stronger than hate?” and marchers responded “Hell no!”
Protests and demonstrations have continued to be held throughout Pittsburgh in the weeks since the March 22 acquittal. The following Saturday, students marched through Oakland, blocking traffic on Bigelow Boulevard. They entered restaurants like The Porch and Hello Bistro, protesting Pittsburgh’s gentrification, as documented by Post-Gazette reporter Courtney Linder.
On Sunday, nearly 200 gathered for a vigil at the Hawkins Village housing complex where Rose resided. Flowers and candles were places in the center of the basketball court where Rose hung out. Tim Stevens, a longtime social activist, told the Post-Gazette that “One of [his] concerns is that African American kids will get the message that our lives don’t mean anything.”
On Monday, nearly 1000 high school and college students walked out of class. Marching through the streets of downtown, they chanted “Three shots in the back, how do you justify that?” as reported by 90.5 WESA.
Shortly before midnight on March 22, President Jahanian sent an email to the Carnegie Mellon community addressing the acquittal. He said, “no matter our individual opinions about the outcome or the broader societal questions surrounding the trial, we can certainly empathize with the immense pain of a life lost too soon.” Jahanian encouraged students to prioritize their safety if they decide to protest.
Plastered in neighborhoods throughout the city and on the Carnegie Mellon campus are posters of Antwon Rose II, often with the phrase “say my name” or with his poem titled “I am not what you think I am.” In the poem, Rose repeated “I am confused and afraid” and addresses the fear he experienced growing up black in the United States.
On Thursday the University of Pittsburgh Black Action Society staged a die-in on the steps of the William Penn Union. Nearly 120 students, mostly dressed in black, sat on the steps for around 40 minutes in complete silence, as reported by Pitt News.
University of Pittsburgh students are working to plan a protest this coming week, but plans are not confirmed. “Activism on Pitt campus is a little tough,” said Jordan Fields, a junior at the University of Pittsburgh who is involved in social justice work. Field said that some organizations are reluctant to participate in demonstrations because the “administration steps on student’s toes” for demonstrations that are not “sit-ins or die-ins.” She added that “students are frustrated by the pushback that comes with student activism.”
Fields told The Tartan that the Black Men’s Collective has written a list of demands aiming to “make the Pitt experience more comfortable for students of color.”
“I think a lot of black students realize that that could have been any of us,” said Fields. She continued, “Especially since the police officer that killed [Rose] literally worked on campus. And thats even more scary because you wonder now, are there people on this campus [hired] by the university who are capable of killing one us?”

This past week, students may have noticed various conference rooms and hallways clogged with the important-looking attendees of Energy Week. But Carnegie Mellon hosted a far larger conference that those wandering campus could not stumble upon: the annual Women in Cybersecurity conference that was centered in the Wyndham Grand in downtown Pittsburgh.
Women in Cybersecurity, or WiCys as it is frequently abbreviated, was founded in 2013 by Dr. Ambareen Siraj with a National Science Foundation grant at Tennessee Tech. It now has over 4,000 members according to its website and is supported by mostly corporate sponsors such as Cisco, Facebook, and Fidelity.
These sponsors were featured prominently at the conference, with logos found on various meal provisions or sponsored swag. Many of the speakers were prominent women within these companies, with mealtime keynote addresses given by Michele Schochet, Security Director at Facebook; Wendy Nather, Head of Advisory CISOs and Duo Security at Cisco; Patricia Denno, VP Global Intelligence Operations at Fidelity Investments; and Dr. Dawn Beyer, Senior Fellow at Lockheed Martin.
The other presences at the conference were academic presenters, with students presenting posters of their security research, faculty presenters from Carnegie Mellon and other universities, and a small group of military attendees, some in uniform, whose cybersecurity work might have a more national security focus than the corporate cybersecurity that seemed to dominate the conference.
There was a mixture of members of WiCys who were already in the professional world, and student attendees, many of whom applied for the 500 student scholarships available. This meant that the conference largely aimed to cater to the needs of these two groups of attendees.
The conference suggested four different focuses for attendees: Today’s Technology Challenges, which focused on updating people on the state-of-the-art in cybersecurity; Looking Ahead, focused on R&D in the industry; Best Practices, which looked at current industry behavior; and Career Development, aimed at students and younger attendees. These paths manifested themselves through several breakout sessions that allowed conference-goers to choose a schedule that catered to their particular interests.
This produced some moments of juxtaposition in the subject matter attendees consumed at the conference. At one Friday breakout session, a talk titled “We Can Do It! Becoming a 21st Century Rosie the Riveter” ran alongside one titled “Security and Privacy Challenges for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles.”
Though the talks of empowerment might seem like hollow “lean in” advice in a field that experiences a gender disparity as extreme as only 20 percent female representation, according to one 2017 study by Cybersecurity Ventures, it is worth noting that this number has almost doubled the 2013 estimate, which is partially attributed to the support of professional networks like WiCyS.
The keynote speakers, who had all achieved success in their cybersecurity careers, often noted times at which this low number of women in the field affected their path. Nather noted that at one meeting, she realized that she was the only woman in the room not working as a waitress. Dr. Lorie Faith Cranor, head of Carnegie Mellon’s CyLab, shared that her path to working in the field of usable privacy and security started accidentally, after not liking her high school computer science class because there were “hardly any girls.”
The student attendees seemed to be more diverse than either the speakers at the conference or the Carnegie Mellon computer science program as a whole, which could perhaps signal some future improvement in diversity within the field of cybersecurity.

On Saturday, homemade beats filled the Old Mill room of Google’s Bakery Square office as people from all over Pittsburgh convened for the first-ever TripTech hip-hop hackathon. Carnegie Mellon graduate students, Pittsburgh Public School students, educators, and community leaders worked in the 5th-floor gathering space where teams developed code solutions to musical challenges.
Organized by Ayana Ledford, the director of diversity and inclusion for Dietrich and Heinz Colleges, and associate professors of English Richard Purcell and Stephen Wittek, TripTech took place over three days and culminated in Saturday’s hackathon. The event was free and open to the public. Thursday and Friday featured panels on tech, education, and arts in the Pittsburgh community and beyond, with an emphasis on collaboration across groups.
“I am not a coder,” said LaTrenda Leonard Sherill of Remake Learning in Pittsburgh, at Friday night’s panel. “I am a collaborator, a convener, and a coalition builder. And that’s what we’re working on.” Last year in Pennsylvania, of the 4,000 students who took the AP Computer Science Exam, only 300 were Latinx or Black. “And most of them were in Philadelphia,” Leonard Sherill added.
Though much of Saturday’s activities focused on Python-based code and concepts, the educational theme among panelists was teaching students ways of thinking, not just hard skills like coding. “In school, you’re told what to do, to follow the rules,” said Nina Barbuto, director of Assemble, speaking about the importance of art in technology education.
Saturday’s events kicked off with a talk by journalist, activist, educator, and producer Manny Faces on innovation and hacking in hip-hop. Later, Chenits Pettigrew and John Robinson of Rapport Studios led the group in a condensed lesson on algorithms from their forthcoming project codeSCTY (“Code Society”), which teaches coding basics through rap and hip-hop.
Rapport released an album for the project where every song corresponds to a lesson plan, featuring lyrics like “Be your own boss, we gotta switch the mode / put your soul in the flow that’s controlling the code,” and “recipe for success / a blueprint for building / some moves to live by / steps for solutions.”
Pettigrew previously had success using hip hop and other musical elements to teach US history and English. After crossing paths with a few tech education advocates (including Richard Achee, who works on Google Cloud’s strategic partnerships) and living through the “tech revolution,” he saw a chance to expand the reach of Rapport. “These concepts of computational thinking have a lot more application beyond computer science, but we need to contextualize it all for the kids we’re working with.” So he paired up with John Robinson (formerly Lil’ Sci), who has been performing, educating, and writing rap music for over 20 years, to develop a culturally responsive computer science curriculum for middle and high school students.
Participants in the hackathon also got to demo Python MC, a collaboration between Google employee Richard Achee and Rapport Studios. Think of a blend between GarageBand and Python. The platform allows educators and students to explore variables, loops, and functions in the context of music-making, all coded in Python and free of charge.
Bakery Square, where the Google offices are located, was redeveloped by Walnut Capital between 2007 and 2010, and is now home to nearly 20 businesses, as well as offices for UPMC and Carnegie Mellon’s Software Engineering Institute. The development has been criticized as a gentrification project that excludes longtime East End residents; however, on Saturday the doors to Google were open for anybody interested to come in.
“I see Carnegie Mellon as a convener and a partner sharing our resources, and I also see the Pittsburgh community as a convener and a partner sharing its resources,” said Ayana Ledford, reflecting on the role of each in helping the city move forward. “There’s a lot of community talent that will help make the tools we make in the university much more accessible.”
This year’s event was smaller than she and the other organizers anticipated, partially due to Carnegie Mellon’s Energy Week and the continued demonstrations against the Rosfeld verdict across the city. “I see a lot of value and missed opportunity for those who weren’t able to attend,” she said, hoping that next year, with strategic planning and some momentum from this year’s events, TripTech will be bigger.

Carnegie Mellon Dining Services employees have a rich history of coalition and bonding — from summer picnics to vacations, university-hosted Christmas parties, and more — that goes far beyond workplace small talk. Liz Stanton, the cashier at Hamburg Hall’s Heinz Café, proudly told me that she has every employee’s number. So basically, they’re family.
Yes, some of them are actually family. Many of the dining staff are members of a collection of Pittsburgh families making up the 118 workers of Chartwells Higher Education, the current management company of around half of Carnegie Mellon University’s 34 dining locations. The new dining services provider on campus, Chartwells, started here July 1 of last year.
Stanton, who has worked here at Carnegie Mellon alongside many of her siblings and nieces over the past 14 years, sat down with The Tartan to go over the history of Carnegie Mellon dining, and address the dynamics of family involvement and the various management companies that she has seen over the years.
When Stanton first came to Carnegie Mellon, the management company overseeing dining was Parkhurst, but their contract soon ended, putting CulinArt in charge. Stanton informed us that things got progressively worse over CulinArts contract with Carnegie Mellon, in terms of both communication and performance. Bidding for a new contract went up, and Chartwells has taken over since.
Chartwells’s recent role at Carnegie Mellon has not been without controversy, such as its recent firing of five full-time workers — down from an initially proposed 18 — in violation of a union contract with 32BJ SEIU, the workers’ union. Multiple workers came back from their Christmas break to a part-time downgrade, temporarily losing the benefits that come with full-time status.
Article 8 of the contract between the SEIU and Chartwells promises job priority for full-time union employees over part-time employees, and, after a complicated dispute involving workers, students, dining services, and the union, the workers got their jobs and benefits back.
The downgrade the workers faced was, as detailed by Stanton, undoubtedly distressing: the full-time hourly rate of $15.00 to a part-time $9.50, the loss of health insurance, and the corresponding inability to provide for the family, prospect of sicknesses that can’t be covered out of pocket, and bills on top of it all.
Stanton, in the context of the dilemma, emphasized the importance of family: “If one’s hurting, I’m hurting. We all helped each other out when they brought about this change. We all stuck together until everyone could get back on their feet.”
And while the recent incident with Chartwells was tough, Stanton is keeping her head up. “Change is good; there’s always something good in change,” she said. “We’re working together with Chartwells to make everything better for everyone.”
Stanton explained, “We know students down here on a first name basis. I’ve met so many great people, and we take care of one another down here. The students are a part of our family because we feed them and see them every day. We’re all family-oriented that way,” and reflected on students who have brought her souvenirs from their trips to places like Madrid or London.
With the tight bonds between workers and students, it makes sense that students played an important role in the recent Chartwells dispute. During the period that workers either lost jobs or faced downgrades, a delegation of students took things up with Pascal Petter, the Director of Dining Services, and Jeff Sinciline, Chartwells Resident District Manager, asking Chartwells to comply with the aforementioned SEIU Article 8 via a petition.
Stanton said, “They did a wonderful job,” also noting that the union, whose members include almost everyone working for Carnegie Mellon Dining Services, participated in a similar petition.
Traci Benjamin, SEIU Communications Specialist, was happy with the outcome. “Because of student support and union support, we were able to reach an amicable decision. The students proved to be an extension of the food service family. You can’t put a price tag on that," she said.
As it stands, the current union contract with Chartwells is set to finish in 2020. Workers are looking forward to reaching an agreement with the contractor that will allow them to continue supporting their families and the communities in which they live.

If you’ve ever played Monopoly, you know how it can tear friendships apart. One second you’re cheerfully bickering over who gets to be the car and who has to be the thimble. Two hours later, your friend has a hotel on the boardwalk and you’re praying you land in jail so you don’t have to pay them anything else. 
But while the game Monopoly is frustrating, real life monopolies are worse. For those who don’t know the word outside the context of a mustachioed cartoon in a top hat, a monopoly is when a company has exclusive control of the supply or trade in a commodity or service. In other words, they are the only ones who are able to provide their product to the consumer. Since the consumer can’t get what they need anywhere else, the company can hike up prices or lower the quality of their product without going out of business. 
This might sound familiar, seeing as you probably learned about monopolies in history class. You also probably learned about anti-trust laws. These laws restrict mergers that could decimate competition and prohibit the creation and abuse of monopolies. 
But while these laws were enough to break up Standard Oil, they’re not as effective against modern tech companies such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon.  Facebook purchased two of its prior main social media competitors, Instagram and WhatsApp. Google purchased Waze, a navigating app that once competed against Google Maps. Amazon acquired Whole Foods, among dozens of other startups.  And during every single one of these purchases, the government stayed silent.  
Nowadays, these tech giants seem inescapable. Life becomes much more difficult if you try to function without them. School events have Facebook pages, and Facebook Messenger is a popular choice for chatting about group projects. Countless teachers have told students that they can find the required textbook on Amazon. And when searching for sources for an essay — or making any search in general — more often than not students turn to Google.
The ubiquity of these technology companies can have serious consequences. As previously mentioned, it allows companies to set whatever price they want for their goods while also granting them more leeway to produce inferior products. The lack of competition can lead to stagnation as well. If there aren’t any products you need to be better than, why bother making your products better at all? 
Monopolies also can hinder justice and progress. According to Elizabeth Warren, tech companies have become so large that “they can bully cities and states into showering them with massive taxpayer handouts in exchange for doing business,” and, in doing so, “act more like a government than a traditional company.” 
These issues extend into the world of journalism as well. U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says, “Healthy democracy requires high-quality journalism. Without a range of independent outlets and the revenue to sustain them, our democracy will continue to crumble." You may have seen the uproar over Facebook’s role in spreading false information during the 2016 election; if there were competing popular social media sites with higher standards of information, would Facebook have worked harder to maintain informational integrity?  
In an attempt to combat the tech monopolies, Senator Elizabeth Warren proposed a regulatory plan that would break up some of America’s largest tech companies, including Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple. At a rally in Long Island City, she laid out the elements of her proposal, including undoing past mergers, rolling back on acquisitions, and barring companies from sharing users’ data with third parties.
While her speech drew applause, there are still some who oppose the plan. Some people believe that using anti-trust laws to break up companies is a slippery slope, eventually leading to the laws being used as a weapon against companies politicians don’t like. Others claim that the laws weren’t created to break up “innocent monopolies,” or monopolies that gained control by simply being better than their competitors.
The question of monopolies is an ongoing debate, and it’s particularly significant to Carnegie Mellon University. In 2018, the undergraduate computer science department sent 27 students to Facebook and 21 to Google. In 2017, it sent 18 students to Facebook and 32 to Google. The class sizes average to about 157 students, so this is not an insignificant percentage. And this only refers to students with bachelor degrees in computer science; if you took into account other majors and higher-level degrees, the number only climbs higher. 
Of course, we don’t mean to blame individual people for taking a good job out of college. But it’s important to be aware of how your actions contribute to larger phenomena. Whatever your opinion of the companies in question, it’s undeniable that they have incredible amounts of power in their field. And with incredible power comes incredible opportunity to abuse it. 
Right now, it’s hard to tell whether Warren’s plan to break up the tech companies will work. But whatever happens, the fact that people are considering the plan is important. We need to have honest conversations about the power that companies have, and if that conversation leads to the decision to curtail that power, so be it.
Yes, the amount of money and social capital may seem intimidating, but Standard Oil was intimidating as well.  These companies were created by humans, they were strengthened by humans, and they can be weakened by humans as well. It’s been done before, and if necessary, it can be done again.

The shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school on Feb. 14, 2018, was a shocking reminder that in the 21st century, the American public is constantly faced with the threat of gun violence, be it in our schools, public spaces, or places of worship. It seems that every time we look at the news or turn on the television we learn of another gunman, another location, and another slew of victims, deaths that tear communities apart.
Rather than accepting our terrifying new status quo, survivors of the Parkland shooting banded together and demanded change, focusing their rage and grief into political activism that manifested into marches, protests, and rallies. Similarly, teenagers across the country, inspired by their zeal for gun reform, staged walkouts as a show of unity, keeping the topic alive in the national conversation.
But beyond the demonstrations, the core message was simple: those in power, by way of being passive, allowed this tragedy to happen, and they must be voted out of office if there is going to be any change.
To millennials who are frustrated with the current political system, exercising the right to vote is offered as the panacea. If you don’t like something, just vote to change it, and if enough people feel the same way you do, then that change will happen. This method of majority rule is the cornerstone of our democracy, with each citizen given the ability to voice their opinion via the ballot box and representatives respecting and serving the will of the people.
As fair and just as the system sounds on paper, we know that that’s not how things really work because those in power seem keen to suppress dissident votes, maintaining their status through questionable methods that seek to disenfranchise the opposition. We see this in the past through our history with racially-motivated gerrymandering and ludicrously difficult voter exams aimed at discouraging minority voters, and more recently in Georgia’s gubernatorial race between Brian Kemp and Stacey Abrams. Now, according to a study conducted by Daniel A. Smith, chairman of the political science department at the University of Florida, voter suppression has also affected the votes of Parkland teens in the November midterm elections, with 15 percent of ballots submitted by Parkland residents between the ages of 18 to 21 being rejected.
While it is true that portions of ballots were rejected since they were submitted past the voting deadline, it does not change the fact that the rate of rejection was higher than the state average, strongly implying that there was voter suppression. Then again, this is an unsurprising finding, as the Republicans of Florida, backed by the National Rifle Association (NRA), will do everything within their power to ensure that guns continue to sell. To them, the answer is never fewer guns.
Simply voting, it seems, is no longer good enough because our ballots can be invalidated for any number of contrived reasons. While in the case of Florida, Republicans are to blame for voter suppression, the problem is not confined to one political party either: Democrats are also responsible for voter suppression, with states like New York having abysmal voter turnout rates due to convoluted laws and regulations. Although Republicans are the ones who are frequently blamed for voter suppression, it’s important to see that neither party is fully intent on playing fair. For them, doing what is best for the people appears a secondary concern to maintaining power and control.
That’s not to say that nothing is being said or done about voter suppression. As we approach the 2020 elections, Democratic presidential candidates like Senator Elizabeth Warren have honed in on the issue. While Warren focuses more on presidential elections and eliminating antiquated processes like the Electoral College, her passion for national voting and ensuring that every vote counts is refreshing to see.
Another approach towards combatting voter suppression — though it has largely been discredited and abandoned — is to use electronic voting, whereby individuals cast their ballots digitally rather than having to report to polling locations. A few states already have such a system in place, but it is only accessible to those under extenuating circumstances. It’s not hard to see why electronic voting is such an unpopular idea: for something as sensitive as political elections, our cybersecurity would have to be impregnable, which it clearly is not, as all the recent Facebook scandals have shown. In order to implement electronic voting, we would have to have incredibly high-level infrastructure that would be immune to hacking or influence by foreign powers, a goal many see as impossible. Yet with the current rate of technological development, it is not inconceivable to one day have secure digital voting. Furthermore, voting electronically has one key advantage, being that technology is the great equalizer. Nowadays, most people either own or have access to a smartphone or a computer with internet access, eliminating the current barriers to voting. While such a reality is likely in the future, we should not outright discredit the possibility.
With this foundational American institution under assault from across the political spectrum, voting reform and accountability should become the highest priority. After all, how can we reasonably expect to solve problems like climate change, healthcare, and gun control if we cannot vote the representatives into power that best align with the values of the voting-age population? Those in power should represent the views of the majority and act accordingly since a government should be based on the consent of the governed. Fixing the voting system will help us return to this social contract, which in turn will allow us to move forward in tackling the grand challenges that stand in our way.

As everyone has probably heard, a brief synopsis of the Mueller report was released this past Monday. The report itself is still classified, but the attorney general, William Barr, reviewed the report and released a summary which disturbed the political climate. The four-page document was hailed by supporters of President Trump as a complete exoneration of the president in terms of collusion and conspiracy. The summary quotes the actual Mueller report in this statement: “As the report states: ‘[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.’” 
You might be asking what qualifies as Russia’s “election interference activities,” and the answer is twofold.
First, the campaign of disseminating misinformation which was waged by the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian “troll farm,” to increase polarization and cause national anger. Platforms like Facebook have become notorious for the quantity of verifiably false and inflammatory propaganda that rose to the surface during the election cycle. I’m sure we’ve all seen memes that portray Hillary Clinton as an evil, baby-eating demon.  The Barr summary stated, “the Special Counsel did not find that any U.S. person or Trump campaign official or associate conspired or knowingly coordinated with the IRA in its efforts.” 
Second, the Russian government actively coordinated a computer hacking campaign which aimed to gather and release the personal emails of key Democrats. This is what gave us the Podesta emails. Again, “the Special Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts, despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.”
At a now-famous campaign rally, Trump asked Russians to release the emails that were still not available to the public. He said, “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.” Apparently, this does not constitute conspiring or coordinating, but it is easy to see how the narrative of collusion gained so much traction.
The report goes on to engage with the topic of obstruction of justice. Angry voices began calling for charges of obstruction when Trump fired Director of the FBI, James Comey. In regard to this, the Barr summary says, “Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.” 
So there we have it: President Trump did not collude with Russia, and he did not commit obstruction of justice. Anyone who was betting on impeachment before 2020 is now looking at grim odds. I, for one, am happy that Trump didn’t commit treason, but not committing treason is really the lowest bar to get over for a president.
The narrative of Trump’s treason gained national prominence, especially among leftist, sensationalist news organizations which milked the story at every possible turn. The story of a compromised president excites readers and can be applied to almost every decision the president makes. Because of the constant reporting, compelling narrative, and extreme polarization, echo chambers supporting the story of treason formed quickly and captured a significant number of people. This system is stabilized and radicalized by a feedback process where increased membership means harsher moderation and the centrists slowly become indoctrinated or banned.
Getting opinions and news from an echo chamber is a very dangerous thing. Not only does it create the feeling of truth in false narratives, but it also creates cognitive dissonance by combining ideology with identity. Members of these circles do not listen to news or experts that promote conflicting narratives while supporting each other by creating a community of like-minded individuals. This is where the ideas become solidified into identity. No amount of logical argumentation can sway the whole community, a threat for democracy. Further, leaders of these communities gain power and reputation by being prominent members of the community. These leaders can never be swayed from their ideology because they would lose their positions in the community, all the while spreading their ideas. We all live in these bubbles. Carnegie Mellon is its own bubble, with its own feedbacks, promoting a worldview that benefits its members. Furthermore, we all have our own media consumption bubbles. Algorithms on YouTube, Netflix, and Google follow a bubble creating maxim, “If you liked that, you'll love this.” It's impossible and exhausting to try and see things from every possible perspective.
The revelation of Trump’s innocence shook the liberal world, especially on forum-style social media platforms like Reddit. Many people believed in the narrative of Trump’s treason because it fits their preconceived notions. Since methods of “liking” or “upvoting” on forums promote articles that the majority of members agree with, and because the majority of people only read headlines, powerful bubbles formed.
On Monday, the bubbles popped. 
Now, the narratives have changed, the goalposts have been moved. A significant amount of people accepted the news, saying that it was always a fringe notion that nobody really fully believed. However, another large, dangerous portion is too invested in the narrative to change their ways. These folks have been beginning to spread ideas that look eerily like conspiracy theories.
A common one is that since Barr is a Trump appointee, he must have whitewashed the report and therefore Trump could have still committed treason. Another is a common narrative of the uselessness of self-investigation, stating that since the FBI is under the direction of the president, they would never admit to finding any incriminating evidence. Another is that this is all another disinformation campaign and that no source can be trusted to accurately report the facts. These retreats into conspiracy, skepticism, and paranoia are extremely dangerous for democracy and further exacerbate polarization.
Instead of these reactions, I suggest that we all take the time to reflect and evaluate our reactions to the news. If you were seriously convinced of Trump’s guilt, it is worthwhile to evaluate your news sources and internet communities. What kind of biases exist in your media consumption? Do you read articles that make you uncomfortable or angry? Do you disregard information and sources that don't conform to your preexisting ideas? Now is an amazing time for people on the left to evaluate their echo chambers. The film of the bubble is temporarily weak, and this is the time to push against the sides and see if you are where you want to be.

With the never-ending list of Democratic presidential candidates for the upcoming 2020 election, it is almost too easy to lose track of who’s who and what they believe in. I have found my Twitter feed drowning in news about Bernie Sanders, Beto O’Rourke, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Cory Booker, all candidates who have made quite the name for themselves. Despite my refusal to endorse any candidate officially (for now), I cannot help but notice the underdog of all these names and campaigns: Mayor of South Bend, IN, Pete Buttigieg. 
Buttigieg, age 37, emphasizes his life experiences in his exploratory committee campaign, “Pete for America.” He plays the role of the bridge between the left and the right, often talking about his identity as a veteran of the Afghanistan war, as a gay man, a member of the Episcopal Church, and a millennial who, simply put, gets it. As a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford and a Harvard graduate, no one can claim Mayor Pete lacks credentials or is not qualified; he was even labeled as the future of the Democratic Party by former President Barack Obama. On top of all of that, Buttigieg has recently made headlines for a video that went viral, showing him casually speaking to reporters in Norwegian, which happens to be one of the seven languages he can speak. 
Pete Buttigieg presents himself to the nation in a way that I admire and respect. He is eloquent in his responses, possessing a charisma that is neither aggressive or insincere, and even had the guts to go on Fox News to talk about his role as a progressive aiming to look beyond ideological labels. Buttigieg stands out from the official candidates from the Democratic party by making small changes in how he presents his ideas. He acknowledges, yet does not emphasize, his sexuality in town halls or meetings. In discussions, he avoids mentioning President Donald Trump. He embraces his Midwestern roots and has recognition for their struggles, rather than disregarding them completely. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, while not an official presidential candidate, comes off as highly presidential, in that there is at least one piece of him and his identity that you can relate to. 
With the conversation of Buttigieg’s role as the Democratic middle-ground, I feel the need to expand on the opinion of moderate politics. In a world where children have lead in their bodies from contaminated water, where black people are systematically oppressed and persecuted, where brown children are held in detention centers away from their parents, where people are paying thousands for insulin, and so on, I often feel that moderate politics is the least effective way to move forward. Why be friends with the oppressor for a few more votes? Why go out of your way to benefit from systematically corrupt political institutions? In a more identity-based light, why should I vote for another white man to become president? And why should I expect him to dismantle the very system he benefits from?
However, I find myself asking if Pete Buttigieg is really a moderate. He explicitly identifies as a progressive Democrat, and his policy points mostly match that label. So why are more center-left and moderate voters more respectful of his campaign? I believe Buttigieg has mastered a balance between politically progressive policies and the moderate facade he wears (with the good intentions of criticizing the Democratic party for often ignoring the Midwest during election season). I personally find this approach genius. Politically speaking, it can propel him in the polls in the long run–whether this is the real him, or a persona he crafted for the nation to see.
All in all, Pete Buttigieg is a captivating person who should no longer be ignored by the mainstream media. Following his CNN Town Hall, Buttigieg has actually gained support and national recognition. With the growing list of Democratic candidates, it is hard to truly tell if Buttigieg will stand out on the national scale to the likes of Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders; however, being the unique, enthralling candidate that he is, I definitely foresee an official candidacy announcement and the earth-shattering aftermath of it soon.

In the span of one week, two survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting died by suicide. Sydney Aiello, Class of 2018, suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and survivor’s guilt. She dreamed of entering the medical field, but classrooms gave her anxiety. She was close friends with Meadow Pollack, one of the 17 killed in the massacre. The impact of the shooting scarred her and led to her death from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the age of 19. Just days later, Calvin Desir, 16, died. As a result, Parkland, Florida finds itself in crisis mode yet again.
Parkland is not the only city that had a loss of life following a mass shooting; Newtown, Connecticut also faced a tragic loss. Not too long after the two deaths in Parkland, the father of one of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School, Jeremy Richman, 49, died by suicide. He was a neuroscientist and had created the Avielle Foundation in memory of his daughter, Avielle, who was one of the 26 who died.
It appears that every time that the news of another mass shooting in the U.S. occurs, someone brings up the topic of mental health. “It’s not guns; it’s mental health!” opponents of gun control love to claim, as if having both a gun problem and a mental health problem are mutually exclusive. Yes, mass shootings and mental health go hand in hand. In the cases of Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Sandy Hook, the perpetrators received inadequate treatment for their mental health. Of course, that shows that there is a shortcoming in how the U.S. handles mental healthcare, and should spark discussion of how to mend its flaws. However, the relationship between mental health and guns is not limited to the mental health of the perpetrator. The discussion of mental health in the context of gun violence is lacking in one critical area: the aftermath of gun violence for survivors.
Currently, mental health resources are inaccessible for many. Kyra Parrow, a survivor of the Parkland shooting, wrote in Vox that “students and teachers were expected to return to the campus and the crime scene. The mental health professionals made available were largely inaccessible and insufficient for the more than 3,000 students and staff navigating their trauma and grief.” Even in the school where you would hope the students and faculty could come together with their shared trauma and pain, there was an expectation to return to normalcy as if nothing happened and to box up the pain. There were therapeutic activities such as “therapy dogs, painting rocks, and hugs,” but they were merely “a bandage to deep mental wounds that needed stitches.”
It’s disheartening to see too many people who chant “it’s mental health!” diverting the topic away from gun control and not proposing any policy change to improve our mental healthcare system. Healthcare costs in general often bar people from seeking professional help. High schools across the nation are facing a shortage of school counselors. Well-meaning people often don’t know how to help someone in crisis. Suicide hotlines often require a wait before one can access a trained responder. Many police departments in our country are not trained for crisis intervention and fewer have specialized crisis response teams. These are just a handful of places that policymakers can start to improve how we approach mental health, but progress appears to be stagnant despite our empty “thoughts and prayers.” As Pope Francis said best, “You pray for the hungry. Then you feed them. This is how prayer works.” It’s time that we move past simply posting our wish for change and make that change happen.
Gun violence extends beyond mass shootings that we see on the news. Approximately two-thirds of gun deaths are from suicides, yet this appears to be the aspect of gun violence that doesn’t get talked about. If we want to talk about how guns and mental health interact, it’s time that we continue the dialogue past mass shootings and ask “how can we improve access to resources for mental health?” Until then, we are simply throwing empty thoughts that do not enact change.
