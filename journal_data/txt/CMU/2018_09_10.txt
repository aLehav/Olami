The Carnegie Mellon University volleyball team welcomed Washington & Jefferson College in its home opener, beating the Presidents in straight sets. With its victory, the 24th-ranked Tartans moved to a 2–2 overall record on the season.
The Presidents started the first set hot, winning a long opening rally. They outscored the Tartans 5–1, but the home team fought back throughout the set, trading shots with the visitors. The Tartans tied the score at 17–17. A service ace by junior Maia So-Holloway gave the Tartans their first lead of the match. After some back-and-forth points, the Tartans took the set 27–25.
Like in the first set, the Presidents kicked off the scoring, 3–0. This time, however, the Tartans quickly took control, going on a 6–0 run to make the score 6–3. The Presidents fought back to cut their deficit to one point, 8–7, but were unable to match the Tartans’ dominant attack. The Tartans led by as much as 14 points during the set and won 25–12.
The third set began with a long rally that covered all corners of the court, the point ultimately going to the Tartans with a kill by senior Sarah Jurgens. After a Tartan service error, they fired off seven straight points to lead 8–1. After leading 16–9 later in the set, the Tartans are held from scoring by the Presidents, who scored seven straight points of their own to tie 16–16. The Presidents took their first lead of the set 20–19, but the Tartans surged at the end to win the set 25–21 and put the match away three sets to zero.
Overall, the teams’ final stat lines were similar. The Tartans finished with a .138 hitting average, 68 digs, six blocks, and eight aces, while the Presidents put up a .063 hitting average, 65 digs, six blocks, and three aces. Nine Tartans recorded kills, Jurgens leading the way with 11. Of the team’s 36 assists, So-Holloway recorded 33 of them, while senior Lauren Mueller registered a match-high four service aces. Junior libero Kayla Yew also led both teams with a season-high 23 digs, followed by 13 from senior Sydney Bauer and 10 from Mueller for the Tartans.
After three losses at the Juniata Asics Invitational over the weekend to third-ranked Wittenberg University, Christopher Newport University, and Juniata College, the Tartans look to bounce back at Saint Vincent College on Tuesday, Sept. 8 at 7 p.m.

After a week of temperatures consistently climbing into the nineties, the Carnegie Mellon University men’s soccer team took to the field on a cool night to face off against the Lycoming College Warriors. Clouds were rolling in as a rousing rendition of the national anthem was performed by the Carnegie Mellon University public address system. The threat of rain was persistent throughout the night, but it held off for the entire game. The Tartans were also able to just hold off the Warriors in a 2-1 victory, putting their record at 2-0-1 for the season, after two double overtime games against Kenyon and Denison Colleges.
The first seconds after kickoff were indicative of the game to come, with Lycoming launching the ball over the top only to have it headed away by a Tartan defender. The Tartans controlled possession back up the field, where an awkward call by the referee led to a Tartan free kick that was punched away by the opposing keeper. As the game began to settle down around the fifteenth minute, the Tartans’ ability to outpossess the Warriors became evident, but the Warriors used their size and strength to stay in the game.
Coaches love to use the cliche, “Let the other team make mistakes,” but there is some truth to every cliche: teams need to play safe but capitalize on opponent’s weaknesses and errors. For the first half, each team played safe. The Tartans and Warriors played to their own strengths to outweigh each other, but each team’s strength in scrappy, physical soccer led to an increasingly chippy game. There were 17 fouls by each team, but only one yellow card was given. The referees were allowing the teams to play, but a handful of missed calls and wrong calls pushed the teams to get into the faces of their opponents and the refs. The first half ended in tepid fashion with the ball at midfield, but immediately after a handful of players were in the referee’s face.
The second half started with a bang. Lycoming was pushing hard against the Tartan’s possession in the back field, but were opened up to some quick switches up the field by the Tartans leading to a cross by senior forward Anthony Gulli landing on senior forward Zack Masciopinto’s forehead at the penalty mark for a snap finish into the far upper corner of the side netting. The Tartans were able to keep up the pressure on Lycoming just after the goal, forcing a corner moments later. A perfect ball was played into the box, but a head bounced it out to the opposite side for Gulli to play a cross towards the back post, where the Lycoming keeper fumbled the ball allowing it to drop and roll just across the line for a goal.
By the sixtieth minute, the score was 2-0 for the Tartans, and they started to slide into a more defensive game to help retain some control, until the last five minutes. Lycoming started pushing their attacking midfielders up to the line of the Tartan defense; the Tartans could only clear Lycoming attacks as far as their defenders, who just played the ball back over the top. Eventually the ball went out for a Lycoming corner that dropped to the ground between the Tartans’ senior keeper Alec Lam, and an attacking player who crashed into Lam. A foul was called, and the attack quelled for a minute.
Later, a Lycoming cross was played to the far side of the box and headed just over the Tartan defenders. Lam rushed out to prevent a goal, and the Lycoming attacker crashed into Lam, with both hitting the ground hard and the ball careening out to the opposite side of the box, where a Tartan defender tackled a Lycoming attacker from behind. A penalty was called, taken, and then finished by Lycoming to make the score 2-1. The players on the field rushed into the net, and a scuffle ensued. The referee had no control for the last three minutes of the game, but the Tartans were able to fight off a physically strong Lycoming Warriors team. In classic Tartan fashion, their heart was in the work, but their brains won them the game.
After a commanding win at La Roche College on Sunday night, the Tartans will next face Westminster College on Friday, Sept. 14 at 7:30 p.m.

You’ve seen it by now, right? The big close-up of the former quarterback’s face, overlaid with the words “Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything.” It’s another controversial marketing decision by Nike, but what does Nike’s support truly mean for Colin Kaepernick’s message?
The ad came out just a few days after it was announced that Kaepernick, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback and pioneer of the divisive anti-police-brutality protests during the national anthem of NFL football games, was to become the face of Nike’s newest ad campaign. You know the story by now. Kaepernick began the protests back in 2016, sitting on the bench during the Star-Spangled Banner in the first few preseason games. Kaepernick, in talking to U.S. military veterans, decided to switch to kneeling during the anthem proceedings, as it was seen as more respectful to the flag than simply sitting.
Kaepernick’s teammate, Eric Reid, joined the quarterback in kneeling during the anthem in solidarity, and soon players from around the league were kneeling left and right, hoping that their position as entertainment figureheads would help their protests against wrongful police brutality and poor prison conditions gain traction.
Boy, did they. Just not in the way they expected.
The protests were met with a vehement backlash. With the election of President Trump, more and more NFL players started to kneel or sit for the anthem, showing their displeasure with the president. He took to Twitter, calling out the athletes for a lack of patriotism and disrespect for America. Many of his supporters agreed with him, saying that the protests were ridiculous. Trump’s tweets showed a complete lack of understanding for what the players’ message really was. To him, the kneeling was an attack on America and, by extension, an attack on him. Support rang out from middle America, with football fans defaming and boycotting the league. Many former fans went so far as to burn their team’s apparel, which, you know, didn’t really do anything except waste money that they had already spent.
The NFL season went on as scheduled in the 2017 season, with flare ups coming and going as people remembered to be angry about something that they didn’t care or try to understand the point of. In the offseason this past year, the NFL owners attempted to make it fineable and suspendable to protest during the playing of the national anthem. The NFL Players Association took grievance with the movement, saying that it was unconstitutional and just generally messed up. These talks are still ongoing, and the anthem protest ban has been halted at this point.
Nike’s role in all of this is a curious one; it seems that executives are banking on young liberals who support the protests to love that a big corporation backed up a controversial subject. It’s a marketing scheme. Nike has sweatshops all over Asia. They’re not a beacon of moral good by any stretch of the imagination, but riding the coattails of someone who put his career on the line to stand against injustice is good for business. Still, Nike has a unique position, as they hold the exclusive uniform contracts for all 32 NFL teams, and they’re a gigantic sponsor of the NFL and anything football related.
Kaepernick remains out of a job and is fighting the NFL owners in a collusion lawsuit, arguing that the NFL teams collectively decided not to offer him a place on a team because of his outspoken political beliefs and actions. With some of the quarterbacks starting this week’s opening games, it’s clear to see that it’s likely true (looking at you, Nathan Peterman).
Now, the problem is that the same former NFL fans who burned jerseys and memorabilia are doing the same to their Nike gear. Again, this doesn’t make any sense and is just a waste of perfectly good clothing, but go off, I guess? Fans are simply outraged for the sake of being outraged. The First Amendment of the Constitution is about freedom of speech, assembly, and press. There’s no good reason Kaepernick should be out of a job at the NFL level for expressing his beliefs.
There’s absolutely no reason that NFL fans should be boycotting Nike’s products. People who are upset about this have things backward. Regardless of your views on things like police brutality and for-profit prisons, Kaepernick, and all the NFL players, have a right as citizens of the United States to use their platform as famous athletes to protest racism in this country, without fear of losing their jobs.
It’s 2018, folks. It’s time to wake up.

On The Athletic’s home page, a heavy font proclaims it loudly as: “The New Standard of Sports Journalism.” Above it are the topics you can explore: from the USA to Canada, the site boasts exclusive hockey, football, baseball, and college sports coverage. Even just glancing at the contributors, there are plenty of instantly recognizable names for even casual purveyors of sports media. For all intents and purposes, it seems like a sports fan’s dream.
Except that it costs $60 a year.
So what is the new standard of sports journalism exactly? And why are the founders so confident they can convince sports fans across North America to reach into their wallets?
Part of this confidence draws directly from the entire reason The Athletic is able to boast such an impressive roster. In mid-2017, sports writers across the country were laid off as some of the bigger networks, like ESPN and Fox Sports, started the process of pivoting to mostly video content. These writers, left without anywhere to go, immediately latched onto The Athletic, founded in Jan. 2016. Although the site began in Chicago, it has since spread to 38 markets, covering nearly every major sports team in the country.
By all accounts, the writing at The Athletic is strong. There are almost 150 writers on staff, and nearly all are well established in their field. A limited selection of articles are released free to the public, but these often show a high level of journalism that is thought provoking, if not worth the investment.
Especially within Pittsburgh, the idea of a subscription sports website is nothing new. Sports writer Dejan Kovacevic launched DK Pittsburgh Sports in 2014, marketed as a subscription-based website providing sports coverage for the greater Pittsburgh area. For a while, this was a revolutionary business plan, and he received much of the same criticism now directed toward The Athletic. According to Kovacevic, The Athletic promised not to start a Pittsburgh site. However, the site premiered their Pittsburgh coverage earlier this year, and currently employs two previous employees of Kovacevic.
The problem is, The Athletic doesn’t challenge any of the conventional tropes of mainstream sports journalism. They do not offer their subscribers anything that cannot be provided from local papers. And yet in a 2017 interview for The New York Times, co-founder Alex Mather stated, “We will wait every local paper out and let them continuously bleed until we are the last ones standing. We will suck them dry of their best talent at every moment.” This predatory mindset has become a rallying point for critics of the subscription site. While writers across the board continue to insist The Athletic is merely meant to be another option of finding sports coverage, the attitudes of the founders and the site itself are extremely aggressive.
But when perusing The Athletic web pages, the coverage looks incredibly similar to those of corresponding local paper sites. Also noteworthy, The Athletic does not provide any different or diverse voices. The website employs primarily white men, something pointed out time and time again by critics. Writers for the site tend to respond in the same way — that they realize this is an issue, and are looking into fixing it. However, a year into their big boom, nothing has changed. In fact, a new hire was announced recently: a man to run and improve their fantasy sports coverage. And yet The Athletic still has no writers or mechanisms in place to cover women’s sports.
The lack of women on staff continues to be a concern for critics. In a Slate article published this month, Aaron Gordon puts it well: “It’s difficult to square the Athletic’s claim that it’s providing stories that readers cannot find elsewhere with the fact that almost all of its writers and editors come from that most conventional of elsewheres...At a time when sports and sports coverage are getting more diverse, the Athletic is harkening back to an era almost entirely devoid of diversity.”
So why, then, can The Athletic claim to be the future of sports writing? The only revolutionary piece of their formula is charging people to read the same content they had been reading for years. There is no new perspective, as they continue to give jobs to those already established in the industry. In fact, thanks to The Athletic, you are more likely to find new, fresh voices at your local papers as they replace those who have moved on.
For sports that are not as heavily in the mainstream, such as hockey or MLS, The Athletic is certainly something new with its more focused, specific content. Perhaps that is why the site has done particularly well among fans of the NHL, with nearly every premier hockey writer transitioning to The Athletic in the past year and a half, with multiple websites now focused on every Canadian market. But for old standards, industry veterans continue to carry the flag, leaving new, promising journalists in the dust.
There are many avenues a site like The Athletic could take. They could pioneer a focused method for writing on women’s sports, something that right now is mostly supported by espnW. They could give new writers a chance to excel in a format that prioritizes emotional and novel stories. They could use their now influence to try something new.
Until then, The Athletic will continue with the same trite formulas established for years by sports pages across the globe. Sure, the writing is good, but does that matter when it’s stale?

Reading, PA is about an hour outside of Philadelphia. Lafayette College in Easton, PA is also about an hour outside of Philly. For the first 19 years of my life, it’s taken more time to get to and from a game at Citizens Bank Park — the Philadelphia Phillies stadium — than I’ve ever spent actually at the game. The experiences have been fun, sitting in a car with my brothers or friends bonding over the shared Hell that is sitting in sports event traffic at 1 a.m., but it was time for a change. I’m over the suburbs.
I transferred to Carnegie Mellon after a year at Lafayette, and I now live in Oakland. Oakland is about 15 minutes outside of downtown Pittsburgh, and it’s another 10 minute walk across the bridge to reach PNC Park, home of the Pittsburgh Pirates. There are no more car rides with rocking tunes or intense bonding experiences in an encapsulated space with people you already intensely trust, but the city offers a different viewing experience of baseball. Baseball is always more than just the game. Every third think piece about baseball analyzes the sights and sounds and smells of the game, but the experience begins by deciding to actually go to a game.
I chose Labor Day, Sept. 3 this year, to see an afternoon game at the park, and it took me all of thirty minutes to reach the stadium, in spite of Labor Day parades rerouting the buses. Walking across the Roberto Clemente Bridge with a multitude of other fans as the water sparkles from the sun in the heat of the day is a uniquely Pittsburghian experience that every baseball fan should enjoy some day. PNC Park itself is a beautiful stadium, with an outfield porch under tree cover that looks with an unimpeded view on the river and city, and has one of the best views in baseball for those sitting behind home plate, with downtown Pittsburgh gracefully rising behind the center field wall.
As for the game, it was hot. There was little resistance to the beating rays of the sun, and there was little resistance from the Reds in the game. With a final score of 5-1, the Pirates handily defeated the Cincinnati Reds to put another win under their belt, inching back towards .500. Adam Frazier went four for four with two runs scored and three runs batted in, and Gregory Polanco was two for four with one run scored and two batted in. The star of the game, however, was Pirates pitcher Trevor Williams, who threw six-and-two-thirds innings, giving up only five hits and one walk. Earning himself a quality start, Williams gave up no runs in the innings he pitched, and a gracious Pirates crowd gave him a standing ovation on his way off the mound. Most contacts that Reds hitters made against Williams stayed close to the infield, save a surprising Billy Hamilton fly ball to center field. For a first experience at PNC Park, I’m glad the Pirates won, but the game is just another of the long list of statistics in the annals of baseball history.
Something important happened at the game, though, that I’m sure happens across America, but is the reason why people will always come back to baseball. My seat was right under the left field foul pole, about one hundred paces away from left fielder Corey Dickerson, but the heat was too much for me in that seat. I moved under cover, and there, in the first row of the outfield seats, was a little boy wearing a Dickerson jersey. Around the seventh inning the boy’s mother said it was time to go, that the sun was too much, but the little boy convinced her to stay a while longer: “What if the Pirates hit thirteen home runs in a row?”
This is why so many Americans love baseball. It’s a working man’s sport that requires effort day in and day out, every day of the summer, but you never know what you’re going to find at the park. There could be a once in a lifetime opportunity — a perfect game — or a banal experience that hits the right mark and leaves a lasting memory. Perhaps, something like a little kid wearing his favorite ball player’s jersey whose just twenty feet away.

Two centuries of time and effort, engulfed in a fiery blaze. 20 million priceless historical and scientific artifacts - gone.
On Sept. 2, the National Museum of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro burned to the ground, a national and international tragedy so great that David Reich, a Harvard Medical School geneticist, said “It’s as if the Metropolitan Museum of Art burned down.” The museum was a place where families could enjoy a fun and educational day, students could visit during school trips, and world-renowned paleontologists, anthropologists, and biologists could conduct research in the museum’s extensive archives. 
The building that burned housed 90 percent of the museum’s complete collection, with some artifacts dating back millions of years, and provided a space for researchers to learn and discover new ancient species and look back to put the present in context.
The museum specialized in Egyptian mummies, dinosaur fossils, and artifacts local to the region. With the fire, these irreplaceable figments of history and science have been suddenly taken away. The disaster's impact on research will begin to be realized in the coming years as this wealth of knowledge is no longer available.
In an article for The Washington Post, Antonio Carlos de Souza Lima, professor of ethnology at the National Museum, wrote that “the destruction of the museum and its collections threatens Brazil’s ethnic minorities.” The museum provided a space to cultivate and protect the indigenous and black cultural history in Brazil and more broadly, South America. It worked with indigenous groups to document their cultural practices, music, and maps, and used affirmative action policies to ensure that native and minority Brazilians would have a hand in recording their own history.
The museum is already planning to rebuild, so that it can continue its mission to preserve and promote cultural and scientific research. But that costs money - as does digital archiving, which would provide “backup” to mitigate any future tragedies. While the cause of the fire has not yet been determined, this event is a clear sign that we need better methods for conservation and digitization.
As for the academics who worked in the museum, their life’s work has been lost. “It is very difficult to react to reality and try to return to life,” said linguist Bruna Franchetta, whose office was destroyed, in a statement to WIRED.
Before the fire, the museum was having funding difficulties, fighting with different governments and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro for resources. The museum had previously resorted to crowdfunding to repair the termite-infested base of a mounted dinosaur. Museum communities around the world, and national and international institutions for art, history, and science must work to support the future of the museum, and the futures of all museums.
Those that criticize museums say they are stuck in the past, constantly mired by the beliefs, values, and perspectives of different eras. But they are essential to our history, and to our human understanding of ourselves and the world we live in.
It’s a hackneyed phrase, but that doesn’t make it any less true: if we do not acknowledge the past and seek to understand it, we are destined to repeat it.

A $3.8 million grant from the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH) has been awarded to Carnegie Mellon's Marcel Just and the University of Pittsburgh's David A. Brent, who will be using the grant to expand on their innovative research on how images of the brain can identify individuals with suicidal thoughts.
Their research, known as the Predicting Risk Imaging Suicidal Minds (PRISM) project, made headlines in 2017 when their initial findings were published. In the study, they examined brain activity in suicidal and non-suicidal participants by comparing images of the brain's response when participants heard positive words, negative words, and words related to suicide. They identified five areas of the brain that were identifiably different between suicidal participants and non-suicidal participants.
Brent and Just then trained a machine learning algorithm on the brain data, and tested it to see how well it could correctly categorize brain images as either suicidal or non-suicidal; it returned results with 91 percent accuracy. When the algorithm was trained only on the data from suicidal brains, it identified images with 94 percent accuracy.
The NIMH grant will fund the research for a further five years.
"The cornerstone of this project is our recent ability to identify what concept a person is thinking about based on its accompanying brain activation pattern or neural signature," said Just, the D.O. Hebb University Professor of Psychology in Dietrich College, in a statement. "We were previously able to obtain consistent neural signatures to determine whether someone was thinking about objects like a banana or a hammer by examining their fMR brain activation patterns. But now we are able to tell whether someone is thinking about 'trouble' or 'death' in an unusual way.”
One limitation of Just's and Brent's past research — as with many psychology studies — is their small sample size (34 participants). While this number was enough to provide valid results, in future work the greater number of participants allowed by the NIMH funding will grant additional confirmation and further insight, and allow them to compare imaging from patients with a greater range of different mental states to broaden the way they are able to interpret the images.
While it's generally agreed that a way to track biological predictors of suicide is needed, some think the PRISM project isn't the best solution. 
Some experts cautioned against placing too much confidence, too soon, in the machine learning approach. “They used a method called ‘cross validation’ to both train and test their machine learning algorithm on the same small data set," explained Derek Hill, a professor of medical imaging science at University College London. "While this is a widely used approach, it is not a true replication study, so it isn’t yet clear whether their algorithm would work on another separate group of patients.”
The largest point of criticism, however, was the method's applicability in a clinical setting.
Brain imaging is expensive, and suicide is an extremely frequent problem. It's unrealistic to expect a switch to this advanced method from simple screening surveys in the doctor's office. “In terms of predicting suicide risk, it is unlikely to move the field forward," said psychiatrist Seena Fazel of the University of Oxford, in response to the 2017 study.
However, if the PRISM method is implemented in a clinical setting, it could potentially help reduce the high number of false positives produced by standard screening surveys — as well as increase the accuracy of screenings.
"Suicide is the second leading cause of death among young adults in the U.S., and current assessment methods rely entirely on patients self reporting and doctors' observations," said Brent. "Any new inroads to better diagnosis and treatment have the potential to save lives."

Living in space can be tough sometimes. You’re millions of miles from home. You’re stuck with your coworkers for long stretches of time. All of your food is suction-wrapped and rationed. And sometimes, you wake up to find out that your home is slowly leaking air. 
On Aug. 30, the astronauts aboard the International Space Station found out that they had been losing air all night. According to cnet.com, flight controllers had been monitoring the drop in pressure and chose to let the astronauts sleep because the leak presented no danger at the time. 
Once awake, the astronauts began searching for the source of the leak; the team consisted of commander Drew Feustel, flight engineers Ricky Arnold and Serena Auñón-Chancellor, as well as Alexander Gerst, Oleg Artemyev, and Sergey Prokopyev. They eventually found a 2 millimeter wide hole in a spacecraft attached to the Russian side of the station. 
According to The Telegraph, Astronaut Alexander Gerst proceeded to plug the hole with something almost every person on this planet has access to—his own thumb. 
It was effective, but perhaps not the “best remedy”, admits NASA’s ground control. The astronauts later used Kapton tape and epoxy to seal the hole more permanently. Flight controllers continued to monitor the cabin and search for a long-term solution.
They also searched for the answer to another question—how did the hole get there?
The first theory blamed either a micrometeorite or a piece of space debris. Although space debris has never caused any significant damage before, experts have warned for years that it is only a matter of time. The sheer amount of junk makes such a collision inevitable; since 1957, over 5,000 launches have resulted in more than 23,000 objects in orbit around earth.
Additionally, many abandoned spacecraft have exploded or broken up, sending their pieces flying into space. Scientists estimate that there are 166 million pieces larger than 1 millimeter shooting through space at speeds of up to 30,000 mph. Of those pieces, 750,000 are estimated to be larger than 1 centimeter. At those speeds, space debris are capable of tearing through spacecraft like a bullet through human flesh, lending this theory credibility. 
More conspiratorial theories have also emerged. According to Smithsonian Magazine, the small hole could have been drilled. The head of Russia’s space agency, Dmitry Rogozin, was the first to make this claim.  
“It is too early to say definitely what happened,” he told the TASS news agency. “But, it seems to be done by a faltering hand…it is a technological error by a specialist. It was done by a human hand—there are traces of a drill sliding along the surface.” 
So is there a saboteur aboard the ISS, biding their time and waiting for the opportune time to strike again? Possibly... but probably not. 
It’s extremely difficult to drill a hole in zero gravity—nearly impossible, in fact. It’s much more likely that a worker on Earth accidentally created the hole during production. One unnamed source suggests that the craft was damaged during testing at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, and someone hastily covered up the mistake. 
Still, even if an astronaut somehow drilled the hole, their intentions were most likely not malicious. Russian politician Maxim Surayev says it is possible an astronaut became homesick and resorted to extreme measures in an attempt to get back to earth.
“We’re all human and anyone might want to go home,” Surayev said. “But this method is really low…I wish to God that this is a production defect, although that’s very sad too—there’s been nothing like this in the history of Soyuz ships.”
The investigation is still ongoing, but for now the astronauts are in no danger. They will continue their duties, and those of us on Earth can continue being grateful that we can't lose our oxygen to holes smaller than the widths of our thumbs.

Dear Michelle, 
I’m a mess. I already have so many assignments due, and we’re only going into the THIRD WEEK OF SCHOOL. I’ve been given exam reviews (for which exams and when!?) and several big homework assignments due this week have been popping up on Canvas out of nowhere! I can’t even look at them!! This is crazy, and the worst part is that I’m terrible at time management! I’ve never been good at it, but somehow I was able to get by in high school. It’s basically habitual for me to leave any assignment to the last minute, but I mean…isn’t that normal for students? I also feel like everyone around me is terrible at time management too, even the upperclassmen! What I don’t get is, how do they do it? How are they able to manage everything? Like, I guess a lot of people pull all-nighters to finish their work, but I really don’t feel like doing that. And yet, how else am I supposed to finish all the work I have this week? Ugh, procrastination is going to kill me! 
I really did play myself,
Cannot Remember Any Motivation
Dear CRAM, 
I understand everything may feel overwhelming at the moment, but I suggest you first just take a deep breath and try to calm down. You definitely don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do (like pull an all-nighter). I know it might be hard to believe, but you can still manage to finish all your work at reasonable times this week. It just requires you putting in a bit of effort to find good times to complete your work.
First, you should log back into Canvas and actually look at and write down all the dates of your upcoming assignments. At least then, you’ll know how much time you have left to work on each assignment. Then, after you read this advice column, figure out when during the week you have time to work on your assignments. Having your own personal calendar that includes all your extracurriculars, classes, leisure times and such is really helpful for planning this kind of stuff out! If you haven’t made one yet, definitely find time to do so (after you’ve finished all your work this week). You might also want to consider how you’re going to finish each of your assignments. Does one homework require using some weird program that you don’t have easy access to? Will you need to collaborate with others on another assignment?
Last thing is to make a list for yourself of each day this week. Grab a piece of paper, and write down all of the things you want to accomplish (for both academics and social activities) in each day. This will also help you prioritize your assignments, along with the other stuff you have to get done in the week. It’s also really satisfying to check things off your list when you’re done. Getting into these organizational habits can, at least in my experience, reduce some of your stress and make getting work done during the week easier. I hope this helps!

Full disclosure: tThe majority of The Tartan staff is under 21, so bars, unfortunately, aren't an option for us to continue with Bar Buddies. For the first edition of the new year and semester, we decided to start exploring other cool restaurants and places in Pittsburgh that offer not just drinks but also some pretty good food. For our first newly regular Brunch Buddies, we decided to break away from some traditional brunch conventions and head down to Bangkok Balcony, a solid Squirrel Hill favorite.
The location: As previously mentioned, Bangkok Balcony is located in Squirrel Hill, right in the middle of the upper Forbes Avenue addresses. There are a lot of Asian restaurants in Squirrel Hill, but Bangkok Balcony stands out because of its setup; as befitting its name, Bangkok Balcony's front door opens to a flight of stairs that lead you to the restaurant, located above an Asian supermarket. Its neon lights and signs make the restaurant look cool and trendy, yet approachable and easy to walk into if you're simply strolling down Forbes Avenue looking for a place to eat.
The food: We both ordered some of Bangkok Balcony's lunch specials, and I (Izzy) also ordered an appetizer: steamed pork and shrimp dumplings. The dumplings were hot, fresh, and had a bit of a homey flavor to them that was surprisingly comforting. It stayed even after the dumplings had dried out after a few minutes as we were talking during brunch. The Pad See Ew lunch special looked kind of small when I first got it, but its flavor made up for its size. Additionally, you could also adjust the spice level of the food: while we both ordered our food at the lowest spice level possible, it did not seem to change the flavor that much at all for the Pad See Ew, and when I was nearly finished I was tempted to order another small portion to take home.
I (Michelle) ordered the green curry with rice, and to be honest, it's one of my favorite things on the menu. I went to Bangkok Balcony for the first time this summer, and my friend had me try the curry when she ordered that time. The flavor of the curry was just so unique, where you can taste the sweetness of the coconut milk with a little bit of spice. The chicken was very tender, and that helped contrast with the crunchiness of the snow peas, broccoli, and green beans. Although both our main dishes took a while to come, I think the wait was definitely worth it. 
The lunch specials each come with a soup, salad, and a spring roll.
The vibe: The restaurant was surprisingly not very crowded when we went, which was around 1 p.m. on a Saturday. The waiters basically seated all the customers by the huge window, so half of the restaurant had people sitting and eating and the other half was pretty much empty. Overall, the vibe of the place was very relaxed because there weren't many people, which was great for brunch/lunch time. 
Lit or nah: I don't think you'll find a very upbeat and lively environment by going to Bangkok Balcony for lunch on a weekend. Even though there's a nice bar, most of the customers around this time were having very casual conversations over lunch, with a nice glass of wine on the side for some. Maybe around dinnertime there's more of a night life, but for the most part, Bangkok Balcony gave off more classy vibes than anything else.

Everything Is Terrible! is the video collective known for discovering some of the most campy, wild, and just plain weird VHS footage. They upload these found footage clips, sometimes edited for comedic effect, to the internet every weekday and have produced several viral hits like “DUANE!!!” and “So Your Cat Wants A Massage?” They are also known for extravagant live shows and for their ongoing effort to construct a giant pyramid out of VHS copies of the movie Jerry Maguire. They were recently in Pittsburgh touring their show “The Great Satan” for the second time. I got the chance to catch up with one of the members of the collective, Commodore Gilgamesh.
Brooke Ley: How has the tour been going so far?
Commodore Gilgamesh:  We’re just starting it, but we have done this show before. We did a tour with it and it was great which is why it is back by popular demand.
BL: Nice! Yeah, I actually went to see you guys whenever you were in Pittsburgh before. Now you’re at a different location. Instead of at the Carnegie Stage you’re at Row House Cinema in Lawrenceville.
CG: Yeah, which is why we’re really happy to come back because we kind of felt like a lot of people didn’t want to go out to the ‘burbs to the community theater out there, so I think a lot of people are happy that we’re coming to the city proper.
BL: Definitely. So, did you decide to revive the show because of demand or were you looking to, I guess, do more stuff? Is there anything we can expect to be different this time around?
CG: Yeah, it is slightly different. It is always evolving, but it is basically the same show which we just brought back because we sold out so many shows. People were just begging us to bring it back, so we caved. Pittsburgh is one of those place where we were turning people away.
BL: Why do you guys decide to tour this movie? Instead of it being just this film it’s this sort of live performance, I suppose, that goes along with it.  What was the inspiration for that?
CG: We’ve been doing this for, you know, the actual shows 8 or 9 years now. In the very beginning, we were asked to do film festivals to screen our movies, and they would fly you out to talk, and we always thought that that was pretty boring. We always laughed whenever film makers started to talk. We just pretty much decided to start building universes around the features that we made and create a much more robust experience for our viewers. It has just grown from there, and now, I mean, if we didn’t come people would be pissed. They’d be confused and pissed, so we have no choice but to keep making it crazier and bigger as we go. 
BL: Definitely.
CG: We love it. I mean, we love building stuff, we love performing, so it’s just like each thing feeds into the other thing.  
BL: Yeah! The shows are great. They’re big and crazy, and one of my favorite parts is the costumes of it and the characters behind it. What were some of the inspirations for the costumes and is that something that people within Everything Is Terrible! work to design or is that something that you have another artist help you guys out to do.
CG: No, we do everything. It’s all us. I designed and built those costumes with a few others of the collective. It’s so fun. It’s basically stuff that we’ve just experiment with and taught ourselves how to do. Most of us don’t really have any, like, formal training on like editing video and we don’t have any formal performance or costuming or anything else so we just have sort of made everything up as we’ve gone. It's just been a fun universe that we can experiment within. Whenever we just come up with some dumb new thing that we want to try to do we just push it into the world that we’re making, and people accept it which is insane! We’re always expecting people to be like “that’s too much you guys need to stop,” but our fans are always down which is amazing.
BL: Yeah, speaking of wild projects that might not have stuck but your fans have got into, you guys have the “*Jerry Maguire*” pyramid going up and are working to collect all of the Jerry Maguire VHS tapes. How’s that project going?
CG: I mean, that is our life’s work. It is a for-real thing. We are going to build a pyramid. We’re still collecting Jerrys. Still collecting bricks for it.  The last “The Great Satan” tour that we did, we received almost 7,000 Jerrys. In this two weeks, we’re expecting to get at least 2,000. You know, there’s a lot of legwork we’re expecting everyone to do, to go out there and get them and bring them to us. That is just an ongoing project that we demand that our followers provide us with building materials. As far as like the boring bones of the project, we’re still looking for land in Arizona to find the right site to purchase and then to move forward with the construction. We’re really keeping it very open and being like this pyramid will rise in the next decade.
BL: It’s funny that there’s a part of this project that you consider to be “boring bones” considering that it’s this Jerry Maguire pyramid.  What’s that interaction like? Whenever you call and you’re talking about purchasing land do you have to explain what it is?
CG: Yeah, absolutely. And it is a big roadblock and that’s why it’s taking us a long time to find the right site. I mean you can assume any time somebody builds like another god-forsaken CVS or whatever else on any corner, it take a lot of crap to do that and to do a three-story pyramid covered in Jerry Maguires in the middle of nowhere is even harder. There is a lot of pretty dumb red tape we need to sort through. We want it to live forever.  We hope that we’re all rotting in the ground for generations while the pyramid is still growing.
BL: Something that I was introduced to your group through - and correct me if I’m wrong but I believe this is sort of your first thing - are doing these short clips from old, wild VHS tapes and other sources and posting them on Youtube. These produced some really good viral content like Duane and the Milwaukee cops vs knives. My first question is if there’s an underrated favorite that you have, one that might’ve not gone viral but you find yourself kind of in love with.
CG: Yeah, it’s so interesting. We’ve done that part of the project for almost 11 years now and that’s obviously the roots of the whole thing and where we’ve gotten all of our inspiration and groundwork for the entire universe that we’ve built. It’s really weird to have posted a video onto the internet every single day for that long. Just to try to organize it in your brain and make sense of it is overwhelming. I have favorites like every month that will not do well at all and I’ll just be so confused, and then there’s ones I won’t think are going to do well at all and they’ll just blow up. The internet is a weird, fickle place like the real world, and nothing makes sense and everything is just truly terrible at the same moment. But yeah, there’s so many ones that I love, like going way, way back to some of the hits I have made that I love is like there’s a public dyeing video that teaches you about a place that dyes pubic hair in various ways. It’s like really insane. I’m a big fan of all the kids’ stuff. I always find that stuff particularly insane.  Just anytime someone thinks they’ve made something for a child and they’re just failing epically and in every way.
BL: Gerbert is a particular favorite of mine.
CG: Yeah, Gerbert is a huge part of our world. I mean, we’ve actually build our own Gerbert puppet that we use for live shows and stuff.  Someone actually asked us one time after a show how we got Gerbert. We’re like “You know we just built that right? Gerbert’s not real. He’s not a real boy.”
BL: With that being the origin, what inspired you to start posting these weird VHS tapes? Were you finding them and decided this is content we need to show people or did you just sort of happen upon it?
CG: It was a lot more personal. We were fans of a lot of found footage work and a lot of video collage stuff and had been in that world for a little while as just viewers and had also just been kids who grew up with VHS tapes. I mean I had two VCRs and a converter when I was really young and I was copying every single tape I rented from the video store.  I would copy pornographic films and sell them to the younger kids.  I’ve been up to the same thing since forever so it only made sense to end up here.  We’re also the perfect age where torrenting and all of that kind of happened right when we were in like late high school and college so we just kind of came into the adulthood of media thinking that we could gather everything and use it however we wanted which is a more extreme interpretation of fair-use than I think a lot of people have.  I think that being our condition combined with being the right age to start on Blogger and Youtube when those things blew up, or as like the more wild-west of the internet blew up, it just kind of gave us a real upper-hand in reaching people 10 years ago.  As far as the project goes, it was personal.  We wanted to make a feature edit. We lived across country from each other we were just sending each other clips on Youtube and people started catching on.
BL: So you guys currently have a lot of projects going on. You have videos going up on Youtube. That’s daily correct?
CG: Yeah, that is daily.  It’s Monday through Friday.
BL: Making thousands of videos. You have the tour up and coming again.  You have Jerry Maguire always. Are there any new projects coming out that you guys are working on or any new areas you’re looking to explore?
CG: Absolutely! Memory Hole, which I’m not sure you’re familiar with, it’s all home video based human horror.  We’re working on a new feature with that and collaborating with some pretty awesome people.  So, I think that’s going to be pretty terrifying and great.  We’re doing a handful of physical installations the next coming while.  We’ve been working with Meow Wolf in Santa Fe quite a bit.  They’re opening a new permanent installation in Denver we’re going to have a room in.  It’s going to be pretty insane.  And other stuff too that I can’t talk about.
BL: Sounds great.  I’m looking forward to it!
CG: Yeah. Busy, busy, busy.
BL: Any final comments?
CG: Yeah, be sure to tell everybody to bring out their Jerrys to the shows.

“He would never give up trying. He would take an impossible situation and make everything possible,” wrote Kevin Kwan in his bestselling novel, Crazy Rich Asians. To many, it may have seemed impossible for Crazy Rich Asians to be adapted to film at all, much less become a blockbuster this summer. But director Jon M. Chu and author Kevin Kwan were determined to have this film in theaters, no matter the cost, even turning down a huge offer from Netflix to guarantee that the film got the audience it deserved. And it paid off, with several consecutive weeks at #1.
Crazy Rich Asians tells the story of Rachel Chu (Constance Wu), an Asian-American economics professor who is invited by her boyfriend, Nick Young (Henry Golding), to his friend’s wedding in Singapore. Unbeknownst to Rachel, Nick is somewhat of a celebrity in Singapore and across the Asian continent due to his family’s wealth and illustrious company. So when Rachel goes to Singapore with Nick, she has no clue what she is about to be thrown into when she arrives.
When I first entered the theater, I honestly had no idea what I was about to experience. I knew it was going to be good, but the minute the theater went dark, I was immediately hooked. The movie opens with child Nick and the rest of the Young family trying to check into their hotel after a long day of travel and getting caught in the rain. However, their hotel staff is extremely rude and disrespectful to the family, even kicking them out and not allowing Nick’s mother, Eleanor (Michelle Yeoh), to use their telephone. Very quickly, however, Eleanor pulls some strings and completely turns the hotel upside down when her husband completely buys out the hotel. That moment, while not a major plot point, was a powerful start to the movie. To see Eleanor exert her influence—instead of being submissive like many people may expect Asians to be—was really incredible to see.
Almost instantly I found myself tearing up. Between Eleanor’s show of strength and oddly enough, simply being introduced to Nick’s quirky family, I felt so empowered and inspired. Even in this brief montage of footage about each of the characters, there was already so much more nuance to them than I had ever seen in any other movies. Whereas films in the past have rarely bothered to flesh out the Asian side characters, all the characters in Crazy Rich Asians, no matter how large or small their role, felt palpable.
As the story progressed and I got to see Rachel struggle to deal with the hardships of disapproval, alienation, and scrutiny, I could feel even more of a connection with her and the rest of the characters. Rachel’s story gave me that raw and authentic feeling of not being good enough or Asian enough to satisfy everyone who was watching her. While I may not have ever had to experience crazy ex-girlfriends and their minions leaving dead fish in my bed, that feeling of being shut out to some capacity is definitely one that people can universally relate to.
Despite all this pain and criticism she faces, Rachel remains strong. She is one of the bravest and most selfless characters I have ever seen on screen. She keeps her head up high and stands up for herself through it all, and finds even the tiniest of victories in the worst situations. Most importantly, she stays true to herself and her heart, even when faced with tough decisions. Watching her journey was an emotional experience, and I’m surprised I managed to survive the experience without a box of tissues by my side (I definitely could have used it).
Although there were some very sad moments in the film, the movie was still a romantic comedy at heart. Interwoven through it all was fantastic comic relief from Rachel’s best friend Peik Lin (Awkwafina) and her family, as well as some of Nick’s weird relatives. I found myself laughing hysterically at the crazy antics of these characters, and swooning over Rachel and Nick’s romance. Their relationship definitely had its ups and downs like any other, but it was so clear even during the worst of it all how much they cared for and loved each other.
I very rarely cry in happiness but I was almost sobbing from the pure, unadulterated feelings. It was the Cinderella story I didn’t realize how desperately I needed. Needless to say, I was a puddle of emotions by the end of the film. Never have I ever fallen so passionately in love with a movie.
At this point, everyone’s probably heard about how groundbreaking it is to have a movie with an all-Asian cast hit the big screen. I just hope that this trend continues, and that we not only see more movies with Asian casts, but that we have realistic representations of all minorities in all movies. It’s hard to truly understand that feeling until you still find yourself crying hours after the movie ended because you finally feel represented. That was me after seeing Crazy Rich Asians, and I hope that everyone can feel that way too someday.

Based on the YA novel of the same name, To All The Boys I've Loved Before follows Lara Jean (Lana Condor), a young girl in her junior year of high school. When Lara Jean has a crush so intense that she doesn’t know what to do, she writes a letter; but when her letters mysteriously get out, all her crushes find out how she felt about them - all at once. One of her past crushes, Peter, suggests that they pretend to date to make his ex jealous and to help cover up Lara Jean's longtime crush for her older sister's boyfriend, and she accepts. As they spend more and more time together, Lara Jean gets more confused about her feelings and realizes that she has real feelings for Peter. The story follows Lara Jean as she tries to set all her relationships straight while navigating the teetering balance between her real feelings and her fake relationship.
To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before is a play on the popular “fake dating” trope, and while there are cliché elements to the movie, it’s overall an incredibly charming story. The movie adhered to many typical romcom conventions, my favorite of which was the freeze-frame character introduction. An easy, simple way to introduce new characters, the freeze-frame allowed the audience to get insight on the characters surrounding Lara Jean from Lara Jean herself. Although it is a common trope, and maybe a little cliché, it worked surprisingly well in this context. And, while we may not all write letters to our crushes, we can all relate to Lara Jean’s embarrassments and heartbreaks, which helps prevent the movie from getting too campy or cheesy. In all, this movie knows what it is – it isn’t striving to be the most innovative romcom or the most inventive; it’s simply trying to tell a heartwarming story with fun characters.
One of the biggest positives of the movie was its diversity. Author Jenny Han, who is Korean American, had expressed the necessity that her main character be Asian American. With so many romcoms being released every year, few actually showcase a diverse leading actor or cast, but that is something that this movie does incredibly well. Condor is herself Vietnamese and visibly Asian. Many Asian Americans, myself included, can often be white-passing, so it’s refreshing to see someone undeniably Asian in a leading role. The best part, though, is that Lara Jean isn’t reduced to any of the typical Hollywood stereotypes – there are no neon streaks of hair, overly quirky traits, or katanas in sight. She is simply a high school girl who happens to be Asian, which is so relieving. It’s strange to be grateful for seeing a culture portrayed normally and without exaggeration, but it is an unfortunate side of Hollywood that has gotten all too common.
However, in an opinion for The New York Times, Han said, “I ended up deciding to work with the only production company that agreed the main character would be played by an Asian actress. No one else was willing to do it. Still, I was holding my breath all the way up until shooting began because I was scared they would change their minds. They didn’t.” Even in a day and age where production companies can be found by the thousands, it’s unsurprising that only one wanted to highlight the original book’s diversity. Adaptations don’t necessarily need to be an exact carbon copy of their source material, but certain aspects – like, for example, a main character who’s a person of color or female – should be respected, especially in the case of female Asian American representation - which is itself few and far between. As an Asian American girl who grew up in California, this is an issue I’m all too familiar with. Every single romcom I saw starred a handsome, classic-Hollywood-looking white man and an equally beautiful white woman. I had never seen people who looked like me in these fantastically romantic movies, and it had a hugely negative effect on me – seeing only other people fall in love and be happy in relationships had created a warped concept of who was allowed to have these cheesy, heartwarming stories and who wasn’t. I wouldn’t call To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before revolutionary, but it’s an important movie showcasing the necessity of diverse characters. 
To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before is the romcom I wish I had growing up and is a sweet portrayal of what it means to be young, innocent, and in love. Representation is a powerful thing, because when you see someone who looks like you, you can imagine being in their shoes. Hopefully, for young Asian American girls, they can look at Lara Jean and realize they too can not only be actresses, but leading women on screen and off.

I had bought my tickets for Wednesday’s Fall Out Boy concert in PPG Paints Arena on Jan. 22 at around 10:15 a.m. My best friend and I sat at a table in Au Bon Pain with both our laptops open to Ticketmaster so we could buy the best tickets possible. For context, tickets for this show had gone on sale on Jan. 22 at 10 a.m.
The Chicago, IL-based emo pop punk band had made a huge impact on both of our lives. It’s a band that’s always been there at small, seemingly insignificant points in my life before building up to become a band that has helped me to define myself and my own identity during my junior year of high school. It’s a band whose lyrics spoke to some of the deepest parts of myself and whose music provided me happiness and guidance when I’d needed it the most.
On their MANIA Tour, Fall Out Boy brought two openers with them: metalcore band Every Time I Die and Machine Gun Kelly. I had known Every Time I Die from the time I tried listening to more punk pop punk music, but I had not expected the level of energy they had brought to the stage. Their music was a bit jarring from what I was used to, but they still made for a fun set and at times their songs were surprisingly heartfelt. The biggest problem, however, was after the set. My friend and I had floor seats, right next to a runway portion of the stage and right next to speakers. Our ears felt blown out, and I was doubting if I would be able to even hear Fall Out Boy perform after Machine Gun Kelly.
Hot off the heels of a feud with Eminem, Machine Gun Kelly did not disappoint at all. The Cleveland, OH-based rapper’s set brought the energy up to new heights after Every Time I Die’s performance, performing crowdpleasers and hits like “Bad Things” and “Rehab.” Machine Gun Kelly threw in a diss at said opponent and walked into the crowd interacting with fans who were holding up “Rap Devil” signs, while performing the diss track of the same name. Putting that fight aside, Machine Gun Kelly was a surprisingly great fit to the tour, and charmed the crowd with his fire, energy, and unwavering confidence and fearlessness.
This was my third Fall Out Boy concert, but from Fall Out Boy’s opener “Disloyal Order of the Water Buffaloes” I remained hooked, pumped, and possibly more excited than I’d been the last two times I had seen them. After seventeen years of performing, the band knows their hits and what really gets the crowd going: nearly everyone in the crowd screamed out the first lyrics to “Sugar, We’re Going Down,” clapped along to “Uma Thurman,” and swayed along to one of the band’s only ballads “Save Rock & Roll.” However, they weren’t afraid to play newer songs as well from their latest album MANIA such as “Stay Frosty Royal Milk Tea,” a stripped-down version of “Young & Menace,” a song that flirts with dubstep; and “Lake Effect Kid,” a song they had written in 2008 and then re-released in a special EP late August.
A lot of the elements of the concert still felt the same. “I Don’t Care” was still the action-packed, unabashed, refreshing banger that kicks off the band’s third phase of songs, complete with middle fingers all over the screen behind them. While no one stood for the band’s national anthem, or “Grand Theft Autumn/Where is Your Boy,” fans who knew the song stood in spirit and sung along to the song’s opening lyrics. Drummer Andy Hurley exercised his superior talent in a drum solo over songs like Kendrick Lamar’s “HUMBLE.” And of course, the band closed off with “Saturday,” one of the band’s first hits that still encapsulates the band’s spirit 17 years later.
Throughout the band’s seven albums, their sound has changed drastically. And it’s pushed some people away, but for a lot of people, Fall Out Boy dominates a realm of nostalgia that’s absolutely infectious and keeps fans, both new and old, coming back for more. When my friend and I arrived and gotten off the 67 bus, we immediately saw two of our friends from orientation who also had floor seats. I had seen a girl who had lived in my freshman dorm with her boyfriend ten minutes later. During the entire night, I’d seen at least ten Snapchat or Instagram stories of Fall Out Boy performing at the concert and gotten a few texts from friends I hadn’t talked to in months trying to find out where I was in PPG Paints Arena. My friend and I ended up taking the bus ride home with a girl who lived two doors down from me my freshman year, and the little sister of one of my first friends at Carnegie Mellon.
And because of that nostalgia, Fall Out Boy brings people together across time and space. Yes, often they get called “Sellout Boy” more times than not. But that nostalgia kicks up some youthful, rebellious joy and energy that unleashes itself anywhere. And that joy and energy was in full force tonight. No matter what, at its core Fall Out Boy remains a band that refuses to be put in a box and constantly breaks the conventions and images that society has created for them.

Kiron Skinner, the founding director of the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Politics and Strategy and Taube Professor of International Relations and Politics, started her new role as a senior policy adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sept. 4. Skinner was additionally appointed as the State Department’s new Director of Policy Planning.
According to the State Department website, the Policy Planning office is responsible for “striking a fine line between [the] day-to-day requirements of diplomacy and the development of long term, strategic plans.” This role, therefore, makes Skinner one of the people shaping United States foreign policy, and includes the power to “bring constructive, dissenting, or alternate views on... foreign policy issues to the Secretary of State.” The power of Skinner’s new role was acknowledged by Carnegie Mellon president Farnam Jahanian, who said of Skinner's appointment that “being called to serve the nation...exemplifies the growing role CMU faculty play in shaping the policy and research agenda at the national level.”
The final shape of that policy and research agenda remains to be seen, however. According to the right-wing blog Breitbart News, “a person close to Skinner described her as a ‘Trump loyalist’ who is not going to deviate from Trump’s ‘America First’ agenda,” while in a statement given to Breitbart News, Skinner said that “[effectively implementing] President Trump’s America First vision means thinking through the President’s ideas and good instincts with the seriousness that they deserve.” These ideas range from the separation and detention of families seeking asylum to an expansive wall on the southern border of the United States.
Skinner has worked with conservative politicians in the past, serving on various boards and political campaigns for George W. Bush, Newt Gingrich, and Mitt Romney, as well as President Trump’s transition team in 2016. Skinner’s new role in Washington, D.C. follows those of former Carnegie Mellon Chief Technology Officer Jeff Boleng, who left Carnegie Mellon in April 2018, and Robert Behler, former Chief Operating Officer and deputy director of the Software Engineering Institute, who left in Dec. 2017, both for positions in the Department of Defense.
Students in the Institute for Politics and Strategy had their own takes on Skinner’s appointment. Eoin Wilson-Manion, a second-year International Relations and Politics major, said that it is “hard for me to get behind anything about the Trump administration,” but that he “[does] think, on a surface level at least, that it is good for CMU to have people [representing it] in the real world.” This is especially true given the enormous Department of Defense contracts, such as a $732 million dollar, 5 year award to the Software Engineering Institute in 2017, or an $80 million dollar award to the Advanced Robotics Manufacturing Group, an initiative led by Carnegie Mellon. According to the Carnegie Mellon’s 2016 annual financial report, sponsored projects like these account for 33.3 percent of the operating revenue, totaling almost 400 million dollars.
Trevor Lazar, a second-year International Relations and Politics major who worked as a research associate for Skinner’s International Relations department, said he “greatly respect[s] her knack for quality research and the strength of her convictions.” When asked about Carnegie Mellon President Farnam Jahanian’s comments about the growing influence of Carnegie Mellon faculty over national policy, Lazar said that he thinks “CMU faculty bring a unique perspective to policy grounded in research and science that is unique to the field. I believe this will be an important, fresh perspective on the national level.” Lazar and Wilson-Manion both commented on how important diverse ideological perspectives are in the International Relations and Politics department, and it will be interesting to see the impact such an experienced, competent person like Kiron Skinner can make in such an influential role.

Carnegie Mellon University’s Andrew Moore, Dean of the School of Computer Science (SCS), announced that he would be stepping down from his position on Aug. 28, after serving as Dean since 2014. Dean Moore will pursue “a new professional opportunity,” as told in a Carnegie Mellon University press release, after finishing the calendar year as Dean.
Carnegie Mellon President Farnam Jahanian spoke high praises of Moore’s tenure, saying “Andrew Moore has been passionate about the impact of technology on society and a leader in the way technology enhances people’s lives. At this pivotal time for both the School of Computer Science and Carnegie Mellon, we will make sure the momentum he built will continue.”
Moore has been with Carnegie Mellon University since 1993, when he joined the faculty as a professor of computer science and robotics. In 2006, he took over as director of Google Pittsburgh for the opening of their Pittsburgh campus. His last four years have been spent as the fifth Dean of SCS.
In an interview with The Tartan, Dean Moore expressed his satisfaction at the increased diversity of the department, saying “SCS has the capability of moving the needle on increased participation in computer science undergrad degree by underrepresented minorities from around the U.S.”
Under Moore’s tenure, the School of Computer Science’s incoming classes reached gender parity for the last three years in a row, as well as growing to 211 students this year from just 139 students in 2014.
On the issue of things he wished he could have seen achieved, Moore said that the department “worked on a bunch of things but I never really got started on the central issues of [the] ultra-important question of the quality of life for our graduate students. Many useful steps forward happened, but we never got around to making it a major annual focus for SCS as it deserves to be.”
That being said, since Moore took over as dean, the graduate and undergraduate computer science programs have remained some of the very top ranked in the world.
In response to the new “President’s Task Force on Campus Climate,” established in the wake of two SCS faculty resigning this August after alledging professional harassment and sexism Moore told The Tartan that “campus climate issues around gender harassment, bullying, and unintentional-but-damaging unconscious bias are a really serious issue.”
He went on to specify that this goes beyond sexual harassment, for which “well defined protocols are in place,” to something known as “professional sexism — one example is the phenomenon described in the title of the Atlantic article: ‘Pushy Is Used to Describe Women Twice as Often as Men.’”
As for whether Carnegie Mellon is better or worse than other places in this regard, Moore is unsure, but he does state that he knows “everyone on campus wants us to be significantly better, not middle of the pack.”
Dean Moore’s career has been an interesting mix of both academic and private sector work, with professorship at Carnegie Mellon University, directing Google Pittsburgh, being the Vice President of Engineering at Google Commerce, to his current position of dean.
Moore told The Tartan that he learned a lot working in industry, specifically a heightened sense of urgency, but he also adds that “one of the biggest things in my role as Dean is getting to know my students and realizing that the middle of the century is probably in good hands.”
Referring to his future employment opportunity, Moore quipped to The Tartan that if he “dropped even the slightest hint, there would be black helicopters circling the campus within minutes.”
At the risk of being overly speculative, The New York Times, in an article on the future Amazon headquarters, raised the question “could the dean of Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science be resigning to run a Pittsburgh HQ2?” The Tartan has no further information on this connection, but regardless, Moore’s future likely sees a salient assignment.
In the Carnegie Mellon press release on his resignation, Moore stated “I want to express my deepest thanks to the amazing students, faculty and staff of SCS,” continuing, “this school is extremely strong and remains a thought-leader in computer science and robotics. With the technological changes now facing mankind, the world has never needed a strong SCS more than it does today.”

On last Wednesday afternoon, the Activities Fair, this year renamed “THE FAIR,” was held in the Cohon Center. Tables of student-run organizations filled the Wiegand Gymnasium, the Connan Room, and Rangos Ballroom from wall to wall. It was quite a testament to the diverse array of interests that make up Carnegie Mellon. Students, mostly first years, rushed in to explore all that Carnegie Mellon has to offer. THE FAIR, held inside this year due to construction on The Cut, lasted a couple of hours.
Club leaders competed for students' attention, hollering jingles at passersby as they handed out stickers and candy. Highlight reels played on laptops, and pop music blasted from portable speakers.
There was a constant refrain of “sign up for our list and take a sticker," or “I see you looking at our poster!”
One voice resounded above all the hoopla. “If you got a face, you got a place! CMU Rowing Club!” shouted Nethani Bryant, senior, with all his might. No one else was putting in as much effort to be heard. One of his teammates held a 12 foot long oar straight in the air, and two others handed out flyers advertising an info session directly after THE FAIR.
“Around 10 percent of the people who sign up for the email blast come to the first meeting, at least for our club,” explained Ashwati Kristan, a postdoctoral student who has been running the Shotokan Karate Club for nine years. Kristan and three other members stood fully cloaked in white karate uniforms, emanating a commanding presence. The club has been at Carnegie Mellon since 1973.
“Take a Unix cheat sheet so you’ll never be alone at CMU not knowing what command to use!” exclaimed Ford Spiegel, a graduate student. The Carnegie Mellon University Computer Club offers students access to a wide array of antique and modern “machines,” as well as some they can't afford. “We do weird things with computers.” The stack of cheat sheets was shrinking quickly.
Over a blaring boom-bap instrumental, Ryan Harty, President of CMU Cyphers, rhymed the names of people interested in the Freestyle rap club. At the table for the Jazz Club, founded just last year, students shuffled through a vinyl collection full of classics; Coltrane, Rollins, and Davis amongst them. SPIRIT was handing out flyers for their annual fashion show. “We are also a haven for people who support black people,” explained Mecca Parker, a senior who is the chair of the SPIRIT fashion show.
“Quidditch has become a combination of many sports; rugby, lacrosse, dodgeball, and baseball,” said Dominique Brych, senior and Captain of the Quidditch team, with excitement. “It’s a fun thing to try at least once!”
There were so many clubs that some even spilled out into the hallways.  At the Kirr Commons, commonly referred to as the Black Chairs, students could register to vote.
Some students seemed to find the array of options overwhelming. “It was packed, a lot of options,” said Medhane Ollushoda, a fifth year who signed up for the Muslim Student Association.
“I think it’s a lot of people, and it's hard to find the club you're interested in,” shrugged Emmanuel Gama, graduate student.

On May 15, Carnegie Mellon students received an email from Dean of Students Gina Casalegno, announcing the school’s new primary dining vendor: Chartwells Higher Education. This change came at the end of a nine-year contract with CulinArt Group, a name that had become as familiar to upperclassmen as the Cut or the Black Chairs. 
In addition to the new vendor, the announcement promised renovations at numerous dining locations, more flexible meal plans, two new dining locations in the Tepper Quadrangle, and further investments in sustainability. On July 1, just six weeks after the email was sent, the contract officially began.
With class in session and dining locations full, the changes are apparent. Pure, a new dining concept located in the Tepper Quandrangle, offers a variety of meals free of growth hormones, artificial flavoring, and antibiotics. The focus, said Director of Dining Services Pascal Petter, is on health and wellness. “Our strategic plan, and the university strategic plan,” he said, “is to provide facilities that are engaging, social, and provide healthy options for students.”
The redesigned La Prima Espresso in Wean lobby and The Underground in Morewood Gardens embody the kind of thinking Petter expressed. The Underground features an entirely new floor plan with more space, an open kitchen environment, and improved lighting. Though the stage and the dingy lighting of yesteryear are gone, classic menu items such as the PB Banana Crunch are still available. 
The La Prima stand in the Wean Lobby has been updated to a full counter with walled seating and line space that doesn’t interfere with foot traffic in the highly-congested area. The popular vendor is currently trying to secure a local contract to provide vegan and vegetarian Grab n’ Go options.
Stephanie’s in the Mellon Institute has been converted to an autonomous 24-hour snack bar named Market C. “Knowing the graduate students who work in Mellon, we wanted to provide a convenient location that also has fresh food,” said Petter, noting the challenging hours required of those students and the difficulties of staffing a location to accommodate those hours. Market C is located on the 4th floor of the Mellon Institute, and is completely automated; customers check out at a kiosk. 
The Cohon Center dining cluster has been given a sleek gray paint scheme, with new concepts Bibimbap (serving Korean rice bowls), Bowl Life (a noodle bar), and Realwich (a sandwich bar serving meats free of nitrates). 
The vegetarian and vegan Evgefstos has been rebranded as Roots, serving an updated menu of grain bowls, superfood bowls, and hot entrees. The City Grill is now the Back Bar Grill, serving familiar burgers and fries as well as new vegetarian options.
Also new in the Cohon Center are feedback kiosks, featuring touchscreen interfaces where students and visitors can quickly rate their dining experience. These stations are subtle, but they indicate an important shift in the culture of Dining Services. “We’re looking to have students be engaged with our dining program,” said Mr. Petter, “and to have input, quite honestly.”
In a proactive effort to improve the dining experience at Carnegie Mellon (Niche.com gave campus food a C+), Dining Services is opening its doors to students, offering a number of ways to get involved.
One exciting proposal penned by Chartwells is a rotating retail concept in which students get to vote on a particular cuisine for each semester. In this proposal, Chartwells chooses the most popular choice and develops a menu, to be offered for the duration of a semester.
Teaching Kitchen, another new project, will be starting this fall, offering chef-led student cooking classes in Schatz dining room. Dining Marketing Coordinator, Nutrition Educator and Dietitian Jessica Tones said that for these classes, simpler is better. “Most people want to learn to cook something that they would actually make again,.. ” explained the veteran cooking instructor. “Teaching someone how to make a vinaigrette can launch them into being able to make a wide variety of dishes.” Teaching Kitchen will happen on a pop-up basis, posted on Dining’s new events page AndyEATS, and will also be available for student organizations and group events.
In addition to student input on food, Dining Services plans to team up with students to take on sustainability issues in the near future. There are currently four locations on campus with composting capabilities; Dining Services and Chartwells hope to collaborate with student group CMU Sustainable Earth to increase that number and convert as much plastic packaging as possible to compostable materials, starting with the Resnik servery.
The issue of waste isn’t a simple procurement shift, however. “It’s one thing to put a compost bin out,” says Petter. “It’s another to communicate to our community what exactly goes in it.”
For more information on dining locations, engagement opportunities, grand openings, and samplings, visit the Dining Services website at www.cmu.edu/dining.

Student Senate will be holding vacancy elections on Sept. 13 at 5 p.m. in the the Cohon Center Danforth room. The Senate is a great way to get involved in student government and have a positive impact on your college as well as the university as a whole.
The different committees that senators can serve on impact academics, campus life, business, and many other important areas at Carnegie Mellon. As a senator, you represent your college, and every senator gets an equal say and equal vote at weekly Senate meetings. The colleges that currently have vacancies are the College of Fine Arts (1), Dietrich College (2), Tepper School of Business (1), and Mellon College of Science (2).
If you are interested in running for senator, you need to have a petition of 25 signatures from members of your own college. For vacancy elections, you will need a signed physical petition, instead of the online petitions for standard elections. The PDF for the petition can be found at: https://www.cmu.edu/stugov/senate/student-senate-vacancy-election-petition.pdf. Once you fill out the petition, you may submit it to mailbox number 46 at the Cohon Center, or to any member of the Senate Executive Committee.
For candidates who have submitted petitions by Sept. 13, they can come before the senate and give a speech detailing why they want to be on Senate, as well as their suitability for representing their college. Following these speeches, the existing senators will vote for the candidates they feel fit best in the vacant seats. For those who don’t get elected into these vacancies, the senate also offers the position of Member At Large (MAL). MALs receive the same amount of influence and speaking power during Senate meetings, but have more flexibility in terms of attendance policy and required hours than regular senators. Those running for a MAL position will have to submit a filled petition and follow the same procedures as those running for senator.

Within the walls of Harvard, a storm begins to brew, threatening to dismantle the previously elusive admissions process the elite Ivy League university has been using for years. As one of the country’s most prestigious universities faces allegations of discrimination against Asian American students, a great threat forms against the future of affirmative action in America. The trial, set to begin mid-October, will ultimately inform the way in which education policy — particularly policy in place to combat forms of discrimination — will consider factors such as race in their application process.
It is common practice in many colleges and universities to include race as one of many factors in a “holistic” consideration of an applicant. While this vague language has been criticized by these students as unfairly subjective, Harvard profusely asserts that this approach is in no way discriminatory for any group but rather assessed in consideration of selecting a diverse pool of students. This search for “diversity” has become the rationale for why those coveted spots are not offered to more Asian American students, pushing them to believe such process stems from discrimination. However, affirmative action may be less involved with those decisions than we believe.
When considering who is to blame in this discussion, the policy that takes the brunt of the argument is not actually part of the problem when it comes to anti-Asian bias. Harvard’s “holistic” admissions process may follow a model calling for higher numbers of all minorities influenced by affirmative action, but its use of other subjective measures bring on problems of their own that make it difficult for students of marginalized groups to overcome. Factors like sociability, charisma, and personality are a few of the non-quantitative methods of measuring students that have been said to be a part of this process. The abolishment of affirmative action does little to help students have more space, but rather enables a more pointed focus on biased and elusive means of judgement.
The complexity of the case is reflected once more in the divisive responses from groups within the Asian American community itself. The National Council of Asian Pacific Americans (NCAPA) issued a statement rejecting the notion that they stood opposed to affirmative action, making a point to highlight the ways in which such policy played a crucial role in aiding Asian American and Pacific Islander students. In their statement, the NCAPA commends universities attempting to apply those policies in their admissions process and stands in solidarity with their efforts. In the eyes of the NCAPA, the goal is not to rid the system of affirmative action, but offer methods of reform that result in the opportunity for more minority students in a system that has historically held a consistent majority through other methods of recruitment.
Universities have obscured the slippage of far more consequential factors affecting admissions by working in smoke and mirrors. Selective admissions that favor room for athletes, children of donors, and legacy applicants are an upheld university tradition that has long been in place with little rebuttal. In Harvard specifically, this preference has proven to put all non-white applicants at a disadvantage, an issue rarely confronted in cases such as these. Top tier universities also seem to often prefer a diverse ethnic makeup rather than taking into account socioeconomic factors, forcing the range of diversity to be limited by those selections. However, universities hide these issues by masquerading their consequences as a result of affirmative action. Regardless of how policy reforms, these untouched allocations set aside by schools for preferred students will continue to create pressure amongst applicants as they leave only a small quota to be filled by disadvantaged students each year.
As things are now, we find ourselves standing at a precipice.  It is a great practice to hold institutions responsible for their ethics, creating equal opportunity for those who have worked to reach these spaces, collectively. The history is available and ever-present, and with its effects laying the foundation for these very conversations to occur, we must choose where we go from here. To all of the Asian American students that feel they suffer from an obsolete system, your experiences are certainly real and your feelings justified. However, the target you choose to confront on the stand should be considered thoroughly if you truly argue for equal opportunity. It is a disservice to your own fight to ignore the historical precedent of the policy that has enabled us the immense progress we’ve made thus far.

John McCain — war hero, Arizona Senator, conservative, and patriot — died on Aug. 25, 2018, just four days before what would have been his 82nd birthday. His passing has brought with it an extended mourning of a self-described maverick; some remark that he was the last of his kind. Moreover, his public battle with brain cancer since his diagnosis last year added a heightened sense of drama and urgency to his final months in the Senate. Indeed, his no-vote that sunk, perhaps for good, Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act will be remembered as one of the most important single votes of this decade. In an era that has left a malleable path for Republicans to pass far-right laws, McCain was a vocal Trump critic who will be remembered for his singular, active resistance in support of a progressive healthcare law enacted by his greatest political adversary. His character and commitment to country shone brighter than his political ideology in the end, and his good actions overshadowed his mistakes in the final chapter of his life.
As an Arizona resident, a progressive Democrat, and a frequent conservative critic (going far beyond Trump), I hold a complicated view of Senator McCain. I disagreed with him on most major policy issues. I particularly took issue with his close ties to the NRA.
However, now, I cannot help but feel grateful. Dissertations could be written by liberals like me over the merits of McCain's tenure in the Senate. If I wrote pages upon pages, covering every vote and decision in John McCain's lifetime, I still would be conflicted. Our politics, as they stand, are not in a state of normalcy. They are rife with vitriol and horrific bigotry and discrimination, coupled with a series of startling breaks with precedent in our political institutions and procedures. I associate people like John McCain with a degree of normalcy. Not stability or even political function, but normalcy.
This distinction is important. The Senate's efficiency has been exponentially slowed by gridlock and hyper-partisanship over the course of the last few decades, and to an extent, McCain played a role in this. Yet, so did all members of the Senate who served and have served during that time. McCain was a politician, no doubt, but he was responsive to his constituents, and respectful of those whose opinions differed.
It speaks great volumes that of the key speakers at McCain's various funeral services, both former President Obama and Vice President Biden delivered eulogies. That speaks to the legacy of an era in American politics that is now just behind us. I find it hard to believe that Barack Obama's recent speech eviscerating the Trump administration only coincidentally lined up with John McCain's passing.
Many — liberals, especially — have criticized President Obama for his relative lack of presence in the public sphere since his departure from office. Whether that criticism is warranted is another conversation altogether. Nonetheless, I believe Obama looked to McCain's vocal critique of the current administration and decided to honor that legacy.
Now, as John McCain is laid to rest, Barack Obama has said goodbye to his respected opponent, Joe Biden has said goodbye to his friend, and our country must say goodbye. In bidding the late Senator from Arizona farewell, we Americans must hold ourselves and our representatives to the standard that John McCain set.
"Ten years ago, I had the privilege to concede defeat in the election for president. I want to end my farewell to you with the heartfelt faith in Americans that I felt so powerfully that evening.
I feel it powerfully still.
Do not despair of our present difficulties but believe always in the promise and greatness of America, because nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history."
Godspeed, Senator McCain.

Donald Trump was right. Wednesday evening, The New York Times released an op-ed validating Trump’s paranoia. The op-ed was anonymously written by a senior-level official in the Trump White House, confirming a strategy of containment for the man inhabiting the oval. This unidentified senior official in the Trump White House has made it clear that they are not a part of the popular left resistance, but a resistance to Trump’s amoral and anti-democratic behaviors.
For the past two days, news organizations around the world have proudly argued that this op-ed will lead to a blue tsunami come November. While the anonymous op-ed is certainly damning, the impact it will have on the midterm elections is questionable. The midterms are only a few short months away, but it is likely that voters will forget this incident given the chaos ensuing within the Trump administration on a weekly basis. By November, this op-ed will surely be masked by other Trump-related scandals.
Not only will the anonymous op-ed be old news by November, it will actually strengthen Donald Trump’s base. For the past two years, his base has listened to him spout endless lies. They defend his mistruths and “alternative facts” as if they have been hypnotized to do so. This shocking op-ed only supports what he has been telling his base all along: there are people working for him in the White House who are trying to undermine his presidency. He was not wrong. There are people working around the clock to keep the President’s impulsive mind at bay.
Although this op-ed from within the administration will strengthen Trump’s main base, there is a very real possibility that it will push people towards the Democrats. There are an increasing number of Republicans ready to cut ties with Trump, which may lead some moderate Republicans to vote for Democrats in the midterms. Surely, this op-ed could push some frustrated voters to the left, but it may come as a sign of reassurance and relief for Republicans that do not support Trump, but support a conservative agenda.
While the motives of this op-ed are quite questionable, the piece tells the American public what we already knew: Donald Trump does not and will not put the country first. Because our nation is so divided, it is likely that this op-ed will be perceived in a variety of ways. Democrats will take this article and run with it, exclaiming that Trump is unfit for office. On the other hand, Republicans may read the op-ed and take comfort in knowing that there are “adults in the room” who will support true conservatism. We should question the underlying motives of this anonymous author, as he or she may be hinting at Republicans who have lost their faith to vote for Republicans in the fall. Either way, this op-ed creates more space in the ever-growing political divide currently taking place in the country.
Many have gone so far as to call this unnamed author a hero, which is a huge stretch. Yes, it is incredible that a senior White House official worked with the so-called “enemy of the people” to release an op-ed confirming what most of the American public already knew, but it is not enough to be called an “unsung hero.” If these people working in the White House were real heroes, they would not have just “whispered” about invoking the 25th amendment to remove the President, they would have actually invoked it. If this unnamed author were a hero, they would have included their name and dealt with the consequences. Apparently, that is all too much to ask.

Over brunch on Saturday, I was discussing with a friend how it is difficult to define and determine “popularity” in college. The concept of “popularity” hadn’t even crossed my mind during my three years at Carnegie Mellon, partly because popularity is so heavily broken down and circumstantial. Popularity mostly concerned people within organizations – they’d won the most awards, participated the most, devoted a lot of time to said organization, or were just likable and friendly people. There weren’t many people whose popularity extended outside of the organization; if anything, their organization was more of a tool to help people remember who they were and what they do. Unlike high school, there was no list nor guidebook as to who was popular or how to be popular in college; in fact, individuality was respected the most more than anything.
There are a lot of problems with the inclusion of a “Popular Oscar,” formally known as the “Outstanding Achievement in Popular Film” category, at the Academy Awards. It put all eligible and already released movies in a weird place and a hot spotlight when it was first announced, creating a singled out and very clear division as to what a “Best Picture” contender and what a “Best Popular Film” contender were. It exposed the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as an organization struggling to remain relevant, announcing other changes that month, such as a shortened broadcast time in order to appeal to viewers. It took some class out of the Academy, making next year’s Oscars feel more like the Kids’ Choice Awards and reminding us that, above all else, the Oscars will always be a production more than an award show. 
There are two big problems that arising from the new “Outstanding Achievement in Popular Film” award, the first being: what is a  "popular film"? More specifically, what is popular? Is it measured by a film’s news coverage, and how much buzz it builds up before awards season? Is it measured by a film’s financial performance, or by how much it makes during its opening weekend and its drop rate thereafter? Is it measured by a film’s critical acclaim, and its stellar reviews from audiences, and is that not already how the Academy voters determine the “Best Picture?”
Academy President John Bailey and Academy CEO Dawn Hudson noted that they were still working on defining what constitutes a “popular film,” and it is perhaps that uncertainty that made the reception to the category worse. If “popular film” were defined by news coverage, then winners would be fairly easy to identify and the actual content of the film could be overlooked. If “popular film” were defined by financial performance, then a range or a benchmark would need to be set in place. However, that also vastly limits the field of nominees and puts more pressure and emphasis on the dollar in Hollywood, the latter which is a larger problem throughout the film industry. If “popular film” is defined by critical reviews, whether from audience or from journalists, then this category really isn’t necessary.
The second problem is that the category devalues and delegitimizes “blockbuster movies.” While eligible, genre movies like science fiction and fantasy that mostly are regulated to the Best Visual Effects categories, comedies of any kind on a small scale, surprise horror hits, or movies from larger franchises such as Marvel, DC, or Harry Potter rarely receive nominations for categories like Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Original Screenplay, or Best Picture. Bailey and Hudson recognized that when creating this new category. In an article from The Hollywood Reporter, Bailey said that the category “wasn’t some knee-jerk reaction to falling ratings or to ABC or to anything like that. It was real[ly] clear on the part of the board and the Academy that we needed somehow to make certain kinds of films eligible for new awards.”
However, putting films like Mission Impossible: Fallout, Crazy Rich Asians, A Quiet Place, or Black Panther into a playground of their own feels more like an insult to each film’s directors, cast, and crew. It makes the word “popular” feel like a stigma. It only furthers the belief that blockbuster, franchise films can’t tell an actual story and are just cash grabs, when in reality the storytelling and thematic possibilities that some of these larger budget movies can convey and tell are endless, rich, and mind-blowing. The “popular Oscar” takes out the diversity that the Best Picture Oscar desperately needs, and neglects attributes of film that make it meaningful and impactful to audience members.
Despite being the least-watched show in the history of the Academy, the 90th Academy Awards actually made some progress in breaking the barrier between “Oscar bait” movies and “popular film.” Horror film Get Out was nominated for four awards, winning one for Best Original Screenplay. In that same category, Amazon romantic comedy The Big Sick also received a nomination. The most landmark of all, superhero western Logan received a nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, becoming the first superhero movie to receive an Academy Award nomination outside of a technical category.
Even though the Academy postponed the category for this year’s awards ceremony last Thursday, their proposed ideas to help bridge this gap are still alarming. Whether they decide to reintroduce the idea in the future or quietly push it off to the side, the Academy should take the perspective of the people in mind to see what constitutes “popular” and apply it to their broadcast, not in their film classification.

From Sept. 24-26, the Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC) will take place in the Cohon Center, and the long history of close collaboration between Carnegie Mellon and the defense industry will almost certainly continue.
The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is the wealthiest and most powerful customer of past TOC corporate attendees such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and General Dynamics. DoD is also a major funder of off-campus Carnegie Mellon research institutions such as the Software Engineering Institute in Oakland (currently on year three of a five-year, $1.73 billion DoD contract), the National Robotics Engineering Center in Lawrenceville (selected in 2016 for four DoD-funded projects totaling $10.6 million), and the soon-to-be-built Advanced Robotics Manufacturing Institute in Hazelwood (earned $80 million in DoD startup funding in 2017). In addition, the DoD awards about $135 million each year (p. 16) in grants to individual CMU researchers in departments like the Robotics Institute, the Institute for Software Research, Psychology, and Social and Decision Sciences. Most recently, in April, the DoD’s Army Research Laboratory established a partnership with our engineering college, CIT, to give its engineers access to the military’s “real-world, challenging problems and data sets, as well as access to ARL facilities, infrastructure, and equipment,” with the ultimate goal of providing “increased capabilities for national security and defense,” according to CIT’s Dean James H. Garrett, Jr.
This relationship goes back until at least 1987, when the university received $103 million from the DoD to fund research in “weapons targeting and tracking.” By 2004, the radio program, Democracy Now!, had run a segment about our school entitled “Carnegie Military University.” And this past May, PublicSource reported on the university’s current connections to the military-industrial complex. In short, Carnegie Mellon’s role in U.S. imperialism and corporate greed are a continuing stain on the university’s public image and a failure of leadership on the part of our administrators.
This failure is epitomized by the companies privileged to attend our most prestigious yearly career fair. The TOC, which is sponsored by CIT and run by the Society of Women Engineers, has hosted numerous companies that profit off of deadly conflict and nuclear proliferation – from Northrup Grumman and Leidos, to Boeing and Bechtel. Their products, such as laser-guided munitions, fighter jets, drones, and surveillance systems, are used in bombing campaigns in Yemen, Syria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Millions of people have fled their homes or died as a result, all while the shareholders of TOC-attending companies rake in billions.
The situation with the TOC is a microcosm of a broader political crisis in the United States since the mid-20th century. As Howard Zinn writes in A People’s History of the United States:
“[After World War II], U.S. business leaders were so pleased with how the war stimulated industry that the president of General Electric [which regularly attends the TOC], Charles E. Wilson, suggested a continuing alliance between business and the military for ‘a permanent war economy.’ (p. 397)”
This war economy has expanded despite the trend of Western governments increasingly turning to neoliberal “austerity” policies, especially since the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. As a result, national military budgets keep increasing while vital social services, infrastructure spending, and environmental protections are slashed. Meanwhile, the companies, institutions, and politicians responsible for this corruption face no consequences. 
Recently, a representative from our group, Students for a Democratic Society, sat down with CIT Dean James Garrett to ask whether the TOC facilitators might consider disinviting war profiteers this year. The Dean said that the companies that attend the conference simply respond to an open call from the university, and that the facilitators refuse to ban particular firms – as doing so would deprive students of the freedom to seek employment where they wish.
But this argument is a dodge, in that it offloads responsibility for the Dean’s own decision to students. It isn’t as though every company in the world attends the TOC, offering students unlimited options. Rather, military contractors and weapons manufacturers are over-represented. Let’s be clear: in addition to its own wars in countries like Afghanistan and Iraq, the U.S. military is indirectly responsible for the violence meted out by the 73% of the world’s dictatorships it supports. Saudi Arabia, one such ally, has already killed tens of thousands of civilians in Yemen, in a war that has led to “the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with more than 22 million people – three-quarters of the population – in desperate need of aid and protection, according to the UN.” In the past, the Saudi royal family also looked the other way as wealthy figures connected to its regime sent money and arms to al-Qaeda and ISIS. 
So, to recap: companies welcomed with open arms to our campus each year are doing business with the U.S. and Saudi militaries, who in turn are supporting dictatorships and terrorist groups, respectively. If Carnegie Mellon higher-ups agree with this business model, they should say so directly and explain why – instead of blaming students for jumping at lucrative opportunities dangled in front of their faces.
Ironically, our university’s founder, Andrew Carnegie, was a staunch anti-war advocate. In 1910, Carnegie created the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think-tank committed to “the abolition of international war.” Carnegie believed that war was “the foulest blot upon our civilization.” What Carnegie failed to see then – and what our college and university administrators fail to see now – was the essential connection between war and big business. War is immensely profitable, especially when it results in the toppling of governments that are unfriendly to U.S. business interests. But regardless of its outcome, war is an economic end in itself. It makes money for those building the weapons, those financing the weapons-makers, those broadcasting the violence in the media, and, increasingly, for the private militias actually fighting on the ground. 
It isn’t surprising that Andrew Carnegie overlooked these economic factors. As a robber baron who mistreated workers and busted their unions, Carnegie wanted to abolish war without addressing its connections to an economic system he was personally profiting from. Dean Garrett refuses to address one of those connections on our campus nowadays, and through his inaction, he is drafting Carnegie Mellon students into the wars of the future.
The good news is that there is still time to say “no” to defense contractors. Were the TOC facilitators to do so, they would not find themselves in a lonely position in the world of tech. Earlier this year, more than 3,000 Google employees joined the successful call to end the company’s contract with the DoD, Project Maven, which would use AI to improve drone targeting. More than 100 at Amazon signed a letter protesting the company’s sale of facial recognition software to police departments as well as its work for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which is right now keeping more than 2,000 children in detention camps. This followed over 100 Microsoft employees’ protest of their company’s cloud computing contract with ICE. 
These brave and principled workers already have the sorts of jobs that students at Carnegie Mellon are right now studying and striving to obtain. However, too many of us end up recruited to build tools for bombings, surveillance, and deportations. The ultimate blame for this lies with our administrators and their laissez-faire policies. But it’s on us, the student body, to tell them that we see them, that we object to their decisions, and that we refuse to enable war without even debating it.
