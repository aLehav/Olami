At the annual Carnegie Mellon Quad Meet last Saturday, both Carnegie Mellon women’s and men’s track and field teams placed first in a field that included Penn State Behrend, Westminster College, and Denison University.
On the women’s side, the Tartans scored 203 points with 11 first-place finishes, far ahead of second place finisher Penn State Behrend’s 131 points. Junior Debarati Bhanja led the Tartans with her record-breaking win in the 100-meter dash. Bhanja’s time of 12.48 seconds set a new school record after 23 years. The junior also won the 200-meter dash, in 26.15 seconds, and the long jump, with a 4.91 meters.
After placing second behind Bhanja in the long jump, junior Autumn Hair jumped 10.80 meters, a career-best, to win the triple jump. Senior Sarah Cook and junior Rose Ciriello placed first and second, respectively, in the 800-meter run, while senior Aparna Alavill clocked in a time of 10:22.77 to win the 3,000-meter run, followed by sophomore Abigail Levine in second place. Sophomore Emmalyn Lindsey added to the Tartan’s points total with a top-place finish in the 3,000-meter steeplechase in 12:07.20.
In the 4x400 relay, the team of Bhanja, sophomores Leah Kendrick and Joanna Baranowski, and first-year Valerie Reiling won with a time of 4:06.24. in the 100-meter hurdles. Kendrick and Baranowski finished 1-2 with times of 15.93 and 16.27, respectively.
Senior Kiersten Chuc and junior Alexa Barriero placed first and third in the hammer throw, respectively. In the javelin, Barriero made a career-best throw of 36.46 meters to win the javelin and finish the meet with a victory for the Tartans.
On the men’s side, the Tartans scored 221 points ahead of Penn State Behrend’s 177 with 10 first-place finishes. Junior Andrew Harter led the Tartans in a sweep of the 3,000-meter run in 8:38.39, a new school record. Juniors Will Mitchell and Jared Moore finished second and third with times of 8:40.63 and 8:41.11, respectively.
With a new school record of 47.55 meters, senior Jacob Schofel won the discus competition, followed by first-year Bram Miller in second place with a throw of 47.06 meters. Shofel had a productive competition, also winning the hammer throw with a toss of 55.82 meters and taking second in the shot put with 13.67 meters, after Miller, who won the event with exactly 15.00 meters.
In the 3,000-meter steeplechase, the Tartans had another sweep, with sophomore Harry Branch-Shaw finishing first in 9:44.87, sophomore Hunter Hartshorne taking second in 9:50.08, and senior Ryan Auld rounding out third in 10:05.64.
In the 1,500-meter run, the Tartans took first and second place, with sophomore Evan Yukevich winning in 4:00.80 and fellow sophomore Liam Walsh following him in 4:01.68.
In another sweep for the Tartans, first-year Arthur Dzieniszewski, junior Mark Moody, and senior Evan Larrick claimed the top three spots in the 800-meter run. Dzieniszewski crossed the line in 1:57.03, Moody followed behind him in 1:57.52, and Larrick finished with a mark of 1:57.92. The Tartans also won the 4x400 relay. Larrick, junior Isaac Mills, graduate student Tanguy Dauphin, and first-year Grant Johnson crossed in 3:26.03.
The team’s fourth and final sweep of the meet was in the triple jump. Senior Eloy Fernandez jumped 13.72 meters, sophomore Fred Dauphin jumped 12.98 meters and junior Reed Farber jumped 12.69 meters for the 1-2-3 finish, respectively. In the pole vault, senior Tommy Mansfield cleared 4.38 meters to win the event.
The women’s and men’s track and field teams will travel to the Dave Labor Invitational on Saturday, April 7 hosted by Slippery Rock University.

This year at the NCAA Championships, the Carnegie Mellon University women’s Swimming and Diving Team placed 15th overall — the highest team finish in the school’s history. Leading this charge was senior Kim Hochstedler, who broke a school record with a fifth-place finish in the 200-yard breaststroke. A competitive swimmer since the age of nine, Hochstedler collected an All-American Honor and an All-American Honorable Mention at the meet two weeks ago, adding to her two other All-American Honorable Mentions throughout her career.
“I knew I wanted to swim in college, and I found that I really clicked with the team here at Carnegie Mellon on my recruiting trip,” said Hochstedler in an interview with The Tartan. “I felt like I immediately belonged on the team and that is what made me decide to commit to the program.”
This year’s NCAA Championships in Indianapolis, IN, held a special significance for Hochstedler, who was born in Indiana.
“This year, the meet was held in Indianapolis, at a pool I swam at many times a year growing up. It was really special to end my swimming career at a pool I spent so much time at before college.” 
She was able to shave more than a second off of her previous career-best 200-yard breaststroke time at this year’s championships, breaking a record at Carnegie Mellon set by herself merely a year ago.
As a senior, this was the last season for Hochstedler, who said, “I am proud that I was able to drop time and improve in all of my events during my college swimming career. Our conference and national competition has gotten faster every year, and I am proud that I was able to make an impact on my team’s success at this level through my four years.”
The team as a whole had a strong showing at the NCAA tournament,  with first-year Jessica Chau debuting at the tournament with a 13th place finish in the 200-yard backstroke, while sophomore Emma Nicklas-Morris finished 13th overall in the 200-yard individual medley.
As the swimming and diving team look forward to the next season, Hochstedler reflects back on her time here at Carnegie Mellon.
“The camaraderie of the team is definitely something I will miss after college. Being a part of the team means that you have immediately made 70 friends among your teammates on campus,” commented Hochstedler. “We hang out together, practice together, and live together, so my teammates have had a large impact on my Carnegie Mellon experience. It really is a great group of people to be with, so I will miss getting to be a part of the team and swimming community after graduation.”

A daily pill has been shown to safely suppress men’s reproductive hormones, making it a strong candidate for a male birth control pill.
The pill, called dimethandrolone undecanoate, or DMAU, works by regulating the body’s hormone levels in order to trick it into thinking it’s already producing enough reproductive hormones. One way to do this is to provide the body with testosterone, which suppresses the production of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormones, the hormones responsible for creating sperm. However, too much extra testosterone can damage the liver. DMAU is designed to suppress sperm production while keeping the liver safe.
At an endocrinology conference this week, researchers presented a study that appears to prove DMAU as safe for regular use. Of the 83 participants, none experienced dangerous or health-threatening side effects and only a few experienced milder side effects (like acne). “DMAU shows great promise,” said Monica Laronda, a reproductive endocrinologist at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago, to online news outlet Science News.
Reliable hormonal contraception for women has been available for half a century, and its development is often celebrated as a milestone for women’s agency over their bodies. However, it also set a cultural precedent that placed the burden of providing reliable contraception mainly on women. Why is no equivalent available for men?
“Scientists have been working on a male contraceptive for decades,” said Laronda. However, trials for male birth control methods are often halted due to adverse side effects. A 2016 trial of a birth control injection for men was ended early because participants reported side effects like “muscle pain, increased libido, and acne,” as well as possible links to depression, according to CNN.
These symptoms will be familiar to many women who use hormonal contraception, as they are some of the most common side effects of the female birth control pill, along with many others, including migraines and nausea. One study published in 2016, with more than one million women over 18 years, found that up to 15 percent of women on hormonal birth control needed to be prescribed antidepressants.
While undeniably a manifestation of inequality, the different ways that clinical trials handle side effects for male and female hormonal birth control is also tied to the time frame of the pills’ development. 
“The female contraceptive pill was associated with significant side effects during its first few years of use, including some fatalities. The [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)] of 1960 is not the FDA of today,” said John Amory, associate professor of medicine at the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle.
The frequent failure of clinical trials has made male contraceptives a tough sell to the pharmaceutical industry. “To some extent, why we haven’t seen involvement with pharma companies is that they’ve been disappointed in the past with failed products,” said Aaron Hamlin, executive director of advocacy group Male Contraception Initiative.
Most scientists and researchers, however, still vehemently support research into a viable hormonal birth control for men, and studies have shown that men want long-term reliable contraceptive options other than just a vasectomy.
Now that DMAU has been proven a safe candidate, the researchers will run a three-month study to measure the sperm counts of men on the pill. After that, the next step is a clinical trial for its effectiveness as a contraceptive.
Many are hopeful that DMAU will finally bring men’s hormonal contraception up to par with the options that have been available to women for decades. 
“It’s hard to solve a problem when you essentially exclude half the world’s population from doing anything about it,” said endocrinologist Arthi Thirumalai, a co-author of the safety study.

On March 23, social media site Tumblr confirmed that it had linked at least 84 accounts on the website to 13 agents of the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian propaganda outfit that sought to sow political discord on social media prior to the 2016 election.
Tumblr deactivated the identified IRA blogs and emailed a list of their handles to any users who had either followed the accounts themselves or interacted with the content that they posted. 
However, Tumblr did not delete the posts from IRA blogs that users had “reblogged” (shared to their own blog). 
In an email with the subject line “Update on Russian-linked activity on Tumblr,” the site informed its users of the actions it had taken, and what it meant for users who had interacted with posts from the IRA-run accounts, as well as Tumblr’s stance on the issue. 
“You aren’t in trouble, and you don’t need to take any action if you don’t want to,” the email read. “We deleted the accounts but decided to leave up any reblog chains so that you can curate your own Tumblr to reflect your own personal views and perspectives.
“Democracy requires transparency and an informed electorate and we take our disclosure responsibility very seriously. We’ll be aggressively watching for disinformation campaigns in the future, take the appropriate action, and make sure you know about it.” 
In a piece for The New Yorker, Adrian Chen, who wrote one of the earliest and most detailed articles on the IRA back in 2015 for The New York Times, described many of the IRA efforts to influence the election on Facebook and Twitter as disproportionately conservative and anti-Clinton.
As it stands, many news outlets have noted that the troll blogs on Tumblr had a left-leaning political bend and some posted innocuous content, usually ripped from Twitter, about social issues. 
Back in early February, Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism stated that the effort on Tumblr was one of the largest to specifically target left-leaning, African-American youth.
Many IRA blogs were staggeringly popular among Tumblr users. According to New York, one such account, under the username nevaehtyler, re-posted a two-minute documentary about street harassment from a Twitter account, and it amassed over 600,000 notes (or reblogs and likes, total). Another, with the username lagonegirl, posted a joke about having anxiety disorder that garnered over 300,000 notes.
The content on these blogs often combined such widely appealing posts with ones that played on emotions in order to manipulate feelings about certain presidential candidates. For example, lagonegirl also made a post slamming Hillary Clinton’s apparent position against free college for all Americans, while failing to mention the fact that the candidate did believe that college should be free for any American who could otherwise not afford tuition without taking out loans.
The blogs also worked together to boost each others’ content. One of the most popular IRA accounts, 4mysquad, reblogged a post from lagonegirl about an apparent sex trafficking scheme that gained over 300,000 notes.
In a more recent New Yorker piece, Chen stated that he believes that the influence of these efforts are overstated by the media. 
After receiving an email from Tumblr, Ryan Broderick, Buzzfeed’s Deputy Global News Director, stated that he believes that the reach of Russian trolls on Tumblr is probably limited. 
At the time of posting, Albright has not measured how many Tumblr users were exposed to IRA posts, but he estimates that about 150 million Americans have been exposed to Russian propaganda on Facebook.
The influence of Russian propaganda on the election results themselves is indeterminable, because we can’t accurately measure how many individuals who shared the content would have voted for Clinton otherwise.  However, because Tumblr chose to leave flagged IRA posts on its users’ blogs, the public now has an opportunity to analyze and reflect on how the IRA’s attempts to spread influence on social media worked.

A unique light formation in the aurora borealis, discovered last year and named "STEVE," is beginning to be understood by scientists as it is studied more.
STEVE is a violet-mauve arc of light with touches of green. While auroras usually resemble large folds of light that move horizontally across the sky, STEVE is a vertical streak that appears at much lower latitudes than the northern lights usually do.
STEVE works differently from the auroras that we usually picture when we think of the northern lights. These auroras form when charged particles from the sun accumulate at Earth's magnetic poles. The charged particles interact with neutral particles in Earth's atmosphere to produce colors. Scientists once thought streaklike phenomena like STEVE were caused by proton activity and called them "proton arcs," but the auroras created by proton activity are invisible to the human eye. They now say that STEVE is caused by a very hot, fast-flowing stream of ions, in a study published in March.
The name STEVE is a "backronym" — it now stands for "Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement," a name given by the scientists that studied it, which didn't originally stand for anything. STEVE's discoverers, citizen scientists in Alberta, Canada, were inspired by the animated movie Over the Hedge, in which forest animals discover a hedge and decide to call it "Steve," never having seen it before or knowing what it is.
Thanks to coordinated photography efforts from citizen scientists in a Facebook group called “Alberta Aurora Chasers,” as well as data from scientific instruments, scientists have been able to document and study this phenomenon with a thoroughness not possible until very recently.
"In 1997, we had just one all-sky imager in North America to observe the aurora borealis from the ground," said Eric Donovan, a researcher at the University of Calgary in Canada. 
"Back then, we would be lucky if we got one photograph a night of the aurora taken from the ground that coincides with an observation from a satellite. Now, we have many more all-sky imagers and satellite missions like Swarm, so we get more than 100 [observations] a night."
Phenomena like STEVE are neither new nor rare, but the ability to investigate them so thoroughly from all fronts is only possible with the information age. 
“[The research was possible] thanks to ground-based observations, satellites, today's explosion of access to data, and an army of citizen scientists joining forces to document it,” said Donovan. “We really are in a truly new era.”

Disappearing frog populations may be recovering
Frog species that have been disappearing due to an aggressive skin fungus may be starting to come back.
In recent years, the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, or Bd, has been killing large numbers of frogs around the world. Species like variable harlequin frogs from Panama disappeared entirely, leaving many scientists fearful of mass extinctions. But, researchers from the University of Nevada, Reno have started seeing certain frogs returning to their habitats.
Researchers aren’t sure what’s causing the rebound. Some think a type of skin secretion that contains pathogen-killing molecules is keeping the frogs healthy. In a lab setting, the secretion has slowed the growth of Bd. 
Others aren’t convinced that frogs could evolve quickly enough to save themselves like this. They think that new habitats and warming global temperatures may be temporarily holding the fungus at bay, as Bd can only grow at cool temperatures, and in cases where frogs move to lower altitudes, or are located in regions where temperatures have gone up, frogs could be benefiting from the limitations of the fungus.
Either way, this isn’t a miracle solution to the problem — many species are still declining or at risk. But it is a glimmer of hope that we haven’t seen the last of these amphibians.

Frozen umbilical cord blood may be useful later
The umbilical cord keeps a baby alive in the womb, sending nutrients and oxygen from the mother to her child. But many are excited about the health benefits the umbilical cord can have later in life — which has led to the phenomenon of banking the umbilical cord, or harvesting blood from it and the placenta and freezing it for later use.
Fetal blood contains many cells and molecules that aren’t really found anywhere else in the body (at least not abundantly). Most importantly, it contains stem cells, which have the potential to become several different kinds of blood cells depending on where they are needed. Umbilical cord blood cells could be used to cure rare anemia, to repopulate blood after treatment for leukemia. The effects may be similar to a bone marrow transplant, but the process of harvesting is far less invasive. Stem cells from umbilical cord blood also don’t have to be matched as closely between donor and recipient. 
Because of these benefits, doctors of new moms are offering them the opportunity to save this blood, and all of its therapeutic capabilities. Though some of the possibilities may not live up to their potential down the road, this is certainly an option many parents aren’t ruling out by throwing away the umbilical cord and placenta, and the blood they contain.

Are coffee beans carcinogenic? California says yes
A court in California has ruled that retailers must label coffee with a warning to consumers that coffee contains a carcinogen. The judge’s ruling came after an eight-year legal battle over whether drinking coffee is good for your health - or whether it could raise your chances of getting cancer.
Roasting coffee beans creates the compound acrylamide as a byproduct. This compound is found in many carbohydrates after cooking, as well as in cigarette smoke and some kinds of adhesives. In one study, rats and mice that were fed acrylamide showed an increased cancer risk. However, the rats in the study were dosed with between 1,000 and 10,000 times the acrylamide than the amount people are exposed to in food. There haven’t been any studies that show strong evidence that acrylamide is carcinogenic to humans. While some research has linked the compound to kidney, endometrial, and ovarian cancer, the results have been mixed, according to the American Cancer Society, and the study data may not be accurate.
“Most experts are going to look at the risk of acrylamide in coffee and conclude that this is not something that’s going to have a meaningful impact on human health,” says Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society.

Bill Burr, one of the most lauded comedic voices of his generation, is coming to Pittsburgh’s Benedum Center on April 6. Featured in shows like Chappelle’s Show and Breaking Bad, the comedian boasts a large screen presence in addition to his stand-up specials.
The Tartan sat down with Burr to discuss his upcoming performance. In the interview, writers Rohit Harlalka and Natalie Schmidt are “R” and “N,” respectively, and Bill Burr is “B.”
R: I’m looking forward to seeing you live on Friday in Pittsburgh. I’ve been following you, since I was a teenager, so I’m really excited!
B: Oh, that’s awesome! I’m ready to go! I’ve written a whole new 90 minutes, and it’s been a minute since I’ve been in Pittsburgh. I’m flying in a day early, 'cause Randy Baumann from WDVE has been putting me on since 2006 or 2007, and he’s one of the major reasons that I was able to finally start selling some tickets in Pittsburgh. I love those guys.
R: I love your “City Tour” videos. Do you think you’ll have time to do one here?
B: I should do one! Since I’ve had my daughter, traveling’s been a little different than the way I used to do it. I don’t want to miss her being a little girl, so I just fly in the day of. I don’t have much time in cities the way I used to, but it’s a sacrifice I’m willing to make because she’s awesome.
N: Has it gotten any easier balancing touring since the start?
B: Sometimes after shows, you’re like, oh man, I’m missing something [my daughter's] doing! But, that’s where FaceTime comes in, thank God. It’s one of those deals where, if I was a plumber, I’d still have to go out and fix things. But, I’m home a lot. I work two weekends a month, most of the stuff local. I just build the schedule around her, which is a fun thing to do.
R: What would you say is the most satisfying part about your job?
B: It’s the dream of mine to be a comedian, to go around the country and sell tickets. I have to work at living a dream! (laughs) When I had other jobs, my motivation was getting the hell out of there. I’m not gonna lie to you, there were definitely a lot of tough years and tough gigs. Even then, I get to do what I love.
R: Do you remember the worst you ever bombed?
B:  I don’t think about them, but I could sit here for hours and tell you all kinds of stories of getting stuff thrown at me, getting fired, people writing letters. I was never the flavor of the month, so I had to do all the gigs, so I have the stories! (laughs) I do have a lot of empathy for people who get shot up the ladder. They have to figure out all of this stuff when they’re in their twenties, and it’s not an easy thing. Life is all about getting knocked down and learning how to come back up even harder. Not being stupid about it and keep running into the same wall the same way, you adjust and try to get over it. That was a skill I didn’t have early on, and I used to get eaten up by a lot of things. It’s gotten to the point now that when I do get knocked down, I get this adrenaline rush. It’s weird, it’s just like, “Alright, you just watch this. I’ll come back f***ing harder.” (laughs) They’re not telling young people things like that. They’re telling them, “You can do whatever you want blah blah,” but they’re leaving out how hard you have to work and how you gotta develop that skill of getting punched in your face, falling on your ass, and then getting back up again and learning how to stop your brain from sending you negative messages and that you can’t do it. You gotta be cognizant of those thoughts and beat the shit out of them so they don’t take your dream away! 
N: A lot of people have a lot of different reactions to your comedy, and I think it’s because you have a really different outlook. What’s your process writing new material?
B: It’s a combination of saying what I’m thinking and trying to annoy people before I go somewhere. (laughs) Sometimes, if a crowd is being overly sensitive, I will deliberately say things that make ‘em groan, and then I go even harder in that direction until they start laughing because it’s so ridiculous! If someone’s being malicious and hateful, and that’s all they’re doing, I understand that. The amount of people that waste all this energy getting offended for another group of people that won’t even get offended by the joke is ridiculous. There’s a couple of bits that I’ve actually done in front of the group of people — and this isn’t a race or religion thing, it’s more like a branch of the government — and they love them. I think comics get in trouble because it’s lazy journalism. A lot of people that should be getting s**t don’t because they’re advertising these on news channels. But when we do a gender-neutral joke or something like that, all of a sudden it becomes like this big thing. And it’s just a giant pile of nothing.
N: Do you find it harder being a comedian nowadays?
B: No. Absolutely not, I find it way more fun because it’s bulls**t! A majority of people don’t go to a comedy show to get offended. You do a show in front of 500 people and 499 enjoy it, and one person complains, that’s what people focus on. If you had that approval rating as a president, you’d be the most popular president of all time! And if Donald Trump taught me anything, I couldn’t believe the lack of follow-up with the press when he ran for president. They would call him out on stuff and he’d be like, “I never said that!” and they’d go, “Yeah you did!” and he’d say, “Eh, you’re probably right!” And then nothing after that. I guess they were so used to people trying to dodge questions, and not owning up to it. And it’s just like, “Now what do we do?” The first person I ever saw do that was Madonna. They found nude pictures of her. She goes, “Oh you found those? I got better ones.” And it was supposed to be a huge scandal, but she just completely didn’t give a shit. The whole thing just died. Which is cool to see a pop star do that!  And this isn’t some kind of liberal rant, I didn’t like either one of ‘em.
N: F is for Family got picked up for a third season. What’s it like writing for that show now that you’re a father yourself?
B: The only difference was I tried to get out of the writer’s room a little earlier (laughs). ‘Cause I spend time with my daughter in the morning and then I’d go to work. I’d miss her, and she’d nap, and then she has the afternoon when she’s up and then she’d nap again. So I’d miss the afternoon thing. But once a week my wife would come in for lunch and she’d bring her. That’s all. I’m not gonna do this thing where I’m a dad now and I’m gonna pretend like I’m not a crap moron, you know? That is what I am, and that’s what got me here, I’m not gonna sit there all of a sudden with this “holier than thou” schtick.
R: Do you think you’re gonna focus more on shows like F is for Family now, or continue doing stand-up for the foreseeable future?
B: Oh God no. No way! This business is a hustle. If you have any sort of hustle in this business that you have control of, you can’t let that go. My stand-up and my podcast are my number one things because I can’t fire me. I love doing F is for Family, but that show ends the second Netflix decides they don’t want to do it anymore.
R: It’s good to hear that you’re sticking with the stuff you like to do!
B: Yeah! I love doing F is for Family and I love the people I work with. It’s great, their notes are unbelievably supportive. At the end of the day, it’s their show. Plus, I love doing standup, I love doing my podcast, but it would be too unsettling to be in a position like that with anybody where they could fire me. And I think that for anybody who’s ever worked with themselves, to go back into that situation would be a little scary. 
N: Was it a big change writing standup as opposed to writing an animated Netflix show?
B: Jokes are jokes. I didn’t know how to write a script, really. My writer’s room is wall-to-wall killer, I learn from them every day. The great Mike Price, the co-creator of the show from The Simpsons, just watching how he runs the room. I could get too focused on a conversation or bit, and he’s the guy that keeps the story moving. I didn’t get it at first, I was like, “Aw man, you cut out this whole chunk, blah blah blah,” and I didn’t realize that it was spinning off into this whole tangent, I wasn’t staying on story. With each season, I feel like I’m getting a little bit better at that. There’s definitely days when the script isn’t working and I think, “how the hell did I sign myself up for this?” But the days when it is – which are most days – it’s worth it.
R: I’ve always wanted to ask you — if you were God for a day, what would be the first thing you would do? 
B: I’m trying to think of the one thing that would fix the most things. I would somehow restructure corporations, so that they actually function in a human way. I think that would eliminate a lot of wars. I don’t think that people who work in corporations are evil, I think the way the game is set up is. I would like to think that people wouldn’t want to kill other people so they could make a profit. But I don’t understand [why] war is still legal. They talk about the economy, but they don’t say the real thing: you have dead bodies on your conscience. It’s so funny to me to see Hollywood people going, “I’m gonna run for President!” It’s like, “Dude, you’re gonna have to make decisions where to drop bombs and they’re gonna land on somebody’s baby and you’re gonna to go to bed justifying that.” You wanna be that guy that makes that f**king decision? I have learned though, that we gotta stop blaming each other and we have to just sit down and try to figure out how to get out of this thing.
R: Is there anything you want to say to people who are going to your shows this weekend?
B: I want to say thank you so much for buying tickets and allowing me to continue to live my dream! I plan on giving you more than your money’s worth! And Go Bruins! (laughs) That’s for the Penguin fans out there!

If you visited The Underground last Thursday at around 8 p.m., then you would’ve heard the sweet voices of Carnegie Mellon’s award-winning co-ed a capella group, the Treblemakers. The group, known for their upbeat energy and energetic covers, hosted their very first members-focused cabaret, featuring music from various genres and an original song from music director Andrew Abrahamson, a senior music composition major. Abrahamson and tenor Connor Maggio, a junior mechanical engineering major, played accompaniment and guitar respectively, for several of the individual acts. Even though the cabaret was delayed (turns out rain and electronic mics do not mix well!), the Treblemakers did not disappoint. They showed off their individual skills, proving that they are each as talented as the group is all together.
The show opened with sophomore vocal performance major and assistant music director Krishna Raman and junior mechanical engineering and engineering and public policy major Elizabeth Elrod performing a cover of “You Don’t Do It for Me Anymore” by Demi Lovato. The duo’s voices blended wonderfully together, adding power and emotion. Raman’s smooth riffs and Elrod’s strong head voice combined to create tenderness within the song, showing the audience their vocal range.
Next up, with the entirety of the Treblemakers in attendance, was their high-spirited rendition of Duffy’s “Mercy.” President Julia Napolitano, a senior chemical and biomedical engineering major, shone as the song’s soloist, proving her chops as a talented soprano. The group was clearly having fun, a mood that transferred to the audience as they jived and danced with each other onstage. Complete with impressive beatboxing and a surprising rap, this cover showcased the Treblemakers’ abilities as performers.
First-year business major Amy Liu performed a solo cover of Begonia’s “Out of My Head.” Don’t be fooled by her new member status; Liu’s powerful voice and rich low notes gave her an air of professionalism and a tenderness to her cover. Performing with a similar sense of vocal style was mathematics junior and secretary Drew Moses with his cover of Scott Hoying’s cover of “At Last” by Etta James. His strong vibrato and fluid riffs displayed real confidence and style in this song.
The second duo of the evening was sopranos Taylor Kay Baer, a first-year vocal performance major, and Napolitano, with their rendition of Halsey’s “Sorry.” Their beautiful voices worked really well with each other as they switched between low and high harmonies, showing off their vocal versatility. It was soft, sweet, and filled with emotion. 
Performing next was Vice President Ambika Chetal, a junior chemistry student, belting Beyoncé’s “If I Were a Boy.” This ballad-y version was softer than the original but still powerful and vulnerable, showing off Chetal’s belt and lower notes.
Switching to a more country vibe, sophomore business major Lauren Wholey performed “Mary’s Song” by Tayor Swift. Like Abrahamson and Maggio, Wholey showed off her skill as a multi-talented musician by singing and playing acoustic guitar, making her cover an awesome tribute to Taylor Swift herself. Also playing acoustic guitar was Maggio, performing “Emoji of a Wave” by John Mayer. His skill as a guitarist was apparent, and his soft voice fit the aesthetic of the song well.
A shining moment was first-year Baer’s cover of Kelly Clarkson’s “Piece by Piece.” Choosing to perform a song that was near and dear to her, her performance made it clear how this song hits home emotionally. Even with Abrahamson on piano and Raman providing backup vocals, all of the focus was on her and her beautiful voice. Her cover was sweet and tender, and incredibly impressive.
Maggio then returned for his second performance of the night, a short cover of “Untitled” by Rex Orange County. Busting out his cream-colored electric guitar, Maggio sang, whistled, and played a wonderful cover. His lilting voice paid a strong tribute to the original artist, doing the song justice.
Also a strong tribute to the original artist was Raman’s powerful cover of Sia’s “Elastic Heart.” Not only known for his smooth riffs but also his ability to belt pop power ballads, Raman delivered yet again with this cover of Sia. It was both energetic and warm, truly showing off Raman’s abilities as a soloist.
To close off the show was an original song written by the Treblemakers’ music director Andrew Abrahamson. Titled “Hydroplane,” the song was gentle and bittersweet, featuring a protagonist who is “trying not to lose” his lover and is “sick of waking up alone.” It showed off Abrahamson’s abilities as both a performer and a songwriter, clearly showing the audience that he is the right man for the position of music director. Accompanied by Maggio on acoustic guitar, the two gave a fantastic performance to end their first cabaret.
The Treblemakers all gave an impressive performance at a very successful first cabaret. For more information on the group and their performances (past and future), check out their Facebook page or visit their website at cmutreblemakers.com.

Nelson Mandela, former South African president and renowned anti-apartheid protestor, once said “it always seems impossible until it’s done." Carrying a similar message to Mandela's quote, Wonder, directed by Stephen Chbosky, is an inspirational tale of bravery, independence, confidence, and daring to dream big. The film is about August Pullman, a young boy born with genetic differences causing his face to contrast with those of his peers. The story is inspirational and incredible in its nature and based on a novel written by R.J. Palacio with the same name. 
As August, or Auggie, is starting fifth grade and attending school for the first time, it seems like he has an impossible task ahead of him: making friends, doing well in school, and attempting to grasp how judgmental people can really be. One of the morals of the film is to embrace who you are and to not let people judge you from the outside, emphasizing what’s on the inside. It sounds like a cheesy motto to live by, but if everyone took time to establish who they want to be as a person, rather than thinking about how others will perceive them, we would be better off. Easier said than done, learning who you are as a person is valuable. 
Friendship is another theme of the film. Auggie experiences the harsh reality that, sometimes, the people you thought were your closest friends can turn into those who judge and look down on you. However, something I thought was particularly powerful was how Auggie composed himself after hearing firsthand the negative words said by his so-called “best friend” Jack. He was able to accept that Jack had made a mistake and that moving forward in their friendship would be the best option. This is an incredible idea to witness as an audience member. The fact that a young boy is able to be forgiving to this extent is so empowering to those watching. It displays that, even when you feel that the friendship will never be the same, forgiveness is important. Even though it is only a film, it is quite fascinating that a boy of Auggie’s age is able to comprehend such an important life lesson already. 
Finally, family is another important theme. Having a place to belong and people who love and support you is critical. Also, surrounding yourself with the right people who have your best interests at heart is special. Auggie's family demonstrates that the people that love and take care of Auggie are the most influential in his success.
Overall, I felt that this film was very well constructed. It was nice to be exposed to something outside the “normal” film boundaries. I highly recommend it for all ages, but especially to younger children, for I feel there is a lot to learn from it. Although it has taken a while, the film industry is progressing slowly into an age of cinema in which the emphasis of films does not have to be on a white man, with a female love interest. Though audiences have stayed the same, themes are impactful: main characters are not restricted by gender, and films are beginning to place emphasis on important issues and topics applicable to current events. Indeed, Auggie Pullman is an inspirational boy with a wonderful story that everyone should experience.

Jack White is definitely not a normal person. His weirdness has been clear ever since his days as frontman for The White Stripes in the early 2000s, when he and his drummer ex-wife Meg White would dress in outlandish red, white, and black outfits and bill themselves as a brother-sister duo. But White’s latest record Boarding House Reach — his third solo effort since The White Stripes parted ways in the late 2000s — takes the strangeness to a whole new level, producing an over-the-top, self-indulgent project that, despite a few bright spots, is difficult to listen to. 
While White’s work with The White Stripes had a raw garage rock sound and revolved mainly around scrappy guitar playing and unrefined drums, he has branched out in his solo career. His first two solo albums, Blunderbuss and Lazaretto, introduced the heavy use of piano and violins and an overall more polished, produced sound. Despite being more cleanly recorded, White retained the bristling energy from his White Stripes days, as well as continuing to write wacky yet interesting lyrics. White also began to experiment more, such as with “High Ball Stepper,” a raucous instrumental track featuring a shrieking guitar solo. 
In Boarding House Reach, White opts for a more electronic sound. While he has long been a believer in old-school recording techniques — Blunderbuss was recorded on analogue tape and he prefers to mix without using automation — his new project represents his first foray into Pro Tools, a digital sound recording and production system. The more modern, electronic sound is evident immediately, the first track, “Connected By Love,” beginning with an oscillating effect that sounds like a lightsaber being waved back and forth. While the song later adds piano and drums, the effect continues underneath throughout. The melody and vocal style are reminiscent of Blunderbuss, while a solo that combines guitar and keyboard echoes the sound of Lazaretto. While hints of his previous work remain, the final notes return to a higher-pitched wavering noise that reminds listeners of White’s new direction. 
However, White’s first experience with Pro Tools is like a kid in a candy store. White throws in random sounds with reckless abandon and many of his songs are devoid of structure, just following whatever musical path popped into White’s mind next. For example, the funky “Corporation,” which actually opens with a solid riff, jumps so often between sounds that it feels all over the place. “Ice Station Zebra” starts with a muddy drum beat, then shifts to a hushed piano and a funky rhythm. It also features White attempting to rap (or do spoken word) — something we’ve seen before on “Rag and Bone” from The White Stripes’ Icky Thump — but while the Stripes song features a stomping beat, hard, energetic guitar melody set up by a playful riff, the music in “Ice Station Zebra” is discombobulated and overdone. 
Other times, White just goes too far with the electronic sound effects. On “Hypermisophoniac,” the title of which is derived from a condition where negative emotions and reactions are set off by specific sounds, White attempts to create something beautiful out of irritating sounds, such as his son’s toys. However, the end result is a jarring jumble of clashing sounds. 
Some tracks even deviate from being true “songs.” “Abulia and Akrasia” features a poem being read over pianos and violin, “Everything You’ve Ever Learned” is built around muted drums and White shouting angrily, and “Ezmerelda Steals the Show” has White reciting a magical-sounding story over repetitive guitar picking. While perhaps intriguing for one listen, these tracks just make the album into an even more confounding and disjointed project. 
There are a few bright spots, such as “Connected By Love.” Others include “Over and Over and Over,” which features a boisterous, bouncy guitar riff and smart but odd lyrics that would feel at home on Lazaretto. “Respect Commander,” although a bit messy, is bolstered by moody, raw blues guitar, and the country tune “What’s Done is Done” thrives due to its simplicity. The final track, “Humoresque,” is a calming close to the album, despite its unorthodox origins; White based it around lyrics written by 1920s gangster Al Capone while in prison and music from a 19th-century tune by Czech composer Antonín Dvořák. 
Overall, however, Boarding House Reach is too unfocused and bizarre to work as a cohesion and enjoyable piece of music. Perhaps, it is better viewed as a boundary breaking piece of art, not necessarily meant to be enjoyed but rather studied and analyzed. However, after the two excellent solo albums Blunderbuss and Lazaretto, Boarding House Reach feels like a let down, and a downright mess.

I’ve been doing my best to seek out more unique eateries in Pittsburgh. And, when I say “unique,” I’m referring to a restaurant’s food and atmosphere. I feel like these are the coolest kinds of places to casually meet up with friends and hang out. As of right now, one of my favorite unique restaurants to eat at in Pittsburgh is Love Ramen. It’s located on Atwood Street in Oakland and, like the name suggests, it serves ramen. 
What makes Love Ramen so special, however, is its frozen yogurt backstory. All I know is that Love Ramen used to be named Love Yogurt, and its specialty used to be frozen yogurt. I’m not actually sure when the restaurant’s name was changed, but inside you’ll still find a frozen yogurt toppings bar. I think they still do sell yogurt, but the majority of their customers come for the ramen. 
I discovered this place last summer when one of my friends brought me for lunch. My initial thoughts of the restaurant were “how unusual” and “that’s interesting, a yogurt place that’s known for their ramen.” Once I sat down and finally had a bowl of their ramen, I realized then how cool and unique it was to be eating there. First of all, the ramen is pretty good. There are various options for broths, noodles, proteins, and toppings from which you choose and check off from their laminated menus. The portions are quite filling, so be sure to arrive on an empty stomach. The presentation of the food is also very cute, where you receive your steaming ramen in a large black bowl on a bright red tray, with a large spoon and chopsticks.
My favorite aspect of Love Ramen, however, is its fun atmosphere. The walls are painted very bright and whimsical colors like lime green, orange, and pink. Under all the tables, you’ll find a variety of board games from your childhood that you can play with your friends. And at different sections in the store, you’ll see the remnants of their original “just frozen yogurt” business, which is cool and a bit random. Being in the restaurant definitely makes me feel like a young kid again, and it’s now a favorite spot for me and my friends mainly because of its fun and relaxed setting. Another great thing is that it’s never too crowded when we go and the service is pretty quick. If you’re looking for a nice place to eat with a low-key atmosphere and good ramen, be sure to check out Love Ramen.

There are two things in my life I have discovered in college that have helped me to find solace and a greater sense of knowledge after growing up in Greenwich, CT, out of touch with my Asian roots: Anna Akana’s YouTube videos and Kevin Kwan’s Crazy Rich Asians. Incredibly smart and descriptive, along with being hilarious and relatable, Kwan’s Crazy Rich Asians is set to become a movie this summer with an all-star cast of various Asian-American stars. And, after devouring Kwan’s novel on my nine-hour plane ride back to New York, I personally hope Crazy Rich Asians will be to people like me what Black Panther has become for African-Americans.
Kwan’s 2013 satirical novel tells the story of Rachel Chu, a New York University economics professor who decides to go spend her summer with her boyfriend Nick Young in Singapore along with attending the wedding of one of Nick’s best friends. However, before leaving, Nick neglected to mention his family’s astounding wealth (up in the trillions, most likely) and prestigious lineage (including being in-laws to Thai royalty) to Rachel. As soon as she arrives in Singapore, she is swept up into a world of the exceedingly and extravagantly rich and must navigate Nick’s nosy relatives and the judgment of those within Nick’s social circle, all while continuously trying to stick her ground and maintain her own identity.
Not only does the book fabulously showcase various types of Asians — Chinese, Chinese mainlanders, Singaporeans, Hong Kongese, even Filipinos — Crazy Rich Asians’ rich narration and language helped to perfectly recreate the lavishness, extravagance, and elegance that Kwan associates the Asian upper-class life with. When describing Singapore’s food culture and picturesque surroundings, it was incredibly easy to picture the food in front of you and marvel at the beauty of Nick Young’s home. Kwan immediately immerses you into Nick’s affluent lifestyle, making you feel like you are also Rachel Chu — an outsider walking into a new mysterious world for the first time in a place where its beauty makes you feel so much at home despite very much not being so. Throughout Crazy Rich Asians, Kwan masterfully describes all of his surroundings with vivid description and sharp wit.
However, perhaps his greatest achievement is the dynamic that he has established between the characters, and the accuracy at which he satirizes the upper-class Asian lifestyle. His humor instantly felt relatable and his subtle satire only emphasized that relatability; never had I felt so connected to a singular novel because of the faith I had in him (that I had found very early in the novel) to tell a perspective of a woman stuck in the diaspora, who suddenly realized how out of touch she was with her home continent, and how desperately singled out and lonely she felt. Never had I felt so connected to the generational divide he establishes with Nick’s mother and her friends and relatives to Nick and his cousins, amazed at how he made every single one of Nick’s family members feel like their own unique character separated by their different views, personalities, and interests. Never had I smiled so much at all the Asian references that Kwan makes, the snide side remarks that play at Asian social lives, and at the journey that Kwan took his lead characters on to help them discover their own identities apart from their families, imbuing me with a great sense of pride to be an Asian-American.
The uniquely ridiculous and heartwarming book known as Crazy Rich Asians is as colorful, vivid, hilarious, and fantastic as people say it is, but it does an amazing job at highlighting much more than that. In its own great way, it tells the story of a woman trying to grab a hold of her identity in a divided world, and goes extremely in-depth into questions about identity, family, and love that make Kwan’s novel even more of a treasure. I highly recommend Kevin Kwan’s Crazy Rich Asians not just to people looking for a hilarious beach read to take them out of the tension of academics but to people also searching for their own places in the world and for their own racial definition of themselves.

Dear Izzy, 
I’m heading out to visit my friend at another college, and I’m really excited but really terrified. She goes to a university that’s a lot farther and a lot more different from here, where the campus is a lot bigger and the culture is really different. Basically it’ll be a completely new environment and she’s taking me to all these parties and places and I won’t know anyone there but her. I wanna get the chance to meet new people and talk to all her cool friends, but I’m struggling with how to adapt to this new place quickly and how to open up to people in order to form a connection in a short amount of time. And she’s been like hyping me up to all her friends back home, and I’m worried they’re gonna expect this super cool Pittsburgh gal with a bunch of weird stories and they’ll end up with just an average Pittsburgh gal who is really just an introvert that got adopted by a wacky extroverted friend. Any advice?
[Name]
Dear [Name],
In terms of the new environment, the internet is your best friend. Research more about her college and her city online, and maybe learn a little bit more about the area. It’s also totally fine to go into this new city completely blind; sometimes the most fun can come from discovering things spontaneously, or the unexpected joy and accomplishment of learning that “Yes, I CAN read a map correctly and not get completely lost.” Having a healthy balance of both sides I think will make you the most comfortable.
In my opinion, you’ve already won half the battle; you’ve already established that you genuinely want to go out and meet new people. Enthusiasm takes you a long way, and people will see that charm, excitement, and happiness in you and it’ll radiate off into everyone you meet. And who knows, their positive energy might just radiate back on you, and before you know it...you’ve got a conversation going! Achievement Unlocked! Often what gets in the way of taking that leap into a new, unexpected territory are nerves, but it’s truly our excited anticipation that helps us to overcome them.
Most importantly, don't forget to be yourself. That’s what your friends’ friends are going to be most excited for. If she actually is hyping you up, there must be a reason why: maybe she sees some of you in her friends at college, and wants you to get to know more people who are just as wonderful as you! That's a sign that she truly cares for you as a friend. Just relax and have fun. Everything will turn out just fine! 
Good luck out there!
Izzy

This week, my gals and I decided to mingle with some yuppies in a small Lawrenceville nook called Apteka. The place has garnered quite a good reputation for its 1) unique menu (Polish vegan), and 2) amazing cocktails. I had never been there before, so I decided to book a large party there for a friend’s birthday dinner. Apteka was definitely the highlight of my week, but there were both pros and cons. Let’s start with the pros.
The Vibe: Apteka is a very young, hoppy place with a great mood. A majority of the patrons were young professionals, and the space was open and playful. The lighting is dim and warm, perfect for a dinner-then-drinks agenda. It’s definitely a more upscale, millennial drinking scene, and the prices on the menu prove just that. 
The Food: Polish vegan food never tasted better. Apteka had a sprawling menu with authentic-sounding dishes, from your classic pierogi to the homely borscht. I ordered the Baba Jaga sandwich with a side of pierogies, and I’m pretty sure those were the tastiest vegan dishes I’ve had in Pittsburgh. There was plenty of flavor and texture in the sandwich, and the pierogies did not lose their familiar hearty, creamy taste despite being dairy-free. The drinks were amazing as well. There’s a certain quality to the juices and flavors added that don’t make the cocktails cloyingly sweet, or hard to sip on. Every single one I tried was refreshing, and they had a great selection of wines.
The Location: Here’s where the restaurant falls a little flat. Apteka is a little out of the way from usual Carnegie Mellon routes; It sits right near Bloomfield down the street from the UPMC Children’s Hospital. To get that far down Penn Ave. with a bus, you’d need to somehow get on the 88. Ubering there would probably be the best bet. Additionally, Apteka isn’t a convenient stop from other popular student bar scenes, as central Lawrenceville and the lit part of East Liberty are equidistant 20 minute walks away. 
Lit or Nah: There were some hiccups during our experience there. Luckily, my party made it to the restaurant earlier than our reservation time, because the system is set up for you to wait in line and order before you sit down. So in addition to my wait to order, I had to get to the front of the line to flag down a waitress and check in on my reservation. Once you’re seated, they bring the food over, but to get a second batch of drinks, you’ll have to go back up to the front and order at the bar. It’s a strange system, and the way the room was set up involved getting in other people’s way because of the small space. That alone affected my lit-ness, but good company fixes everything. I enjoyed the atmosphere, and the staff was accommodating. The other groups in the restaurant seemed like they were having fun too, so it’s overall a really good time.

Newt Gingrich, Fox News contributor and former Speaker of the House, made a little-publicized visit to Carnegie Mellon University this week. He was invited by Director Kiron Skinner, the director of the Washington Semester Program, the Institute for Politics and Strategy, and the Institute for Strategic Analysis at Carnegie Mellon. Director Skinner worked with Gingrich on his 2012 presidential campaign and, in Dec. 2017, began working as a foreign policy contributor for Fox News.
According to a press release by the Institute for Strategic Analysis, “[Gingrich] spent a full afternoon being briefed by a lineup of distinguished [Carnegie Mellon] faculty on artificial intelligence (AI) and participated in roundtable discussions on how to bring together policy and technology.”
Gingrich published a column about his experience titled “Newt Gingrich: The future is amazing — Here’s an incredible glimpse of what awaits us,” mentioning technologies such as “a robotic assistant [to] reduce the invasiveness of heart surgery” and new medical analysis tools.
He also discussed the societal changes that could be brought about by new technologies, emphasizing the service jobs that could be displaced by AI and the need to assist workers in learning the new skills facilitated by technological advancements.
Additionally, Gingrich called for caution but optimism for future technological progress, writing that what he saw at Carnegie Mellon could constitute “‘glimmerings of the future,” which he describes as “ideas, events, or developments that...might evolve into something important.” Gingrich wrote that his experiences working with computing pioneer Pete Jensen and reading the books Future Shock and The Third Wave trained him to be on the lookout for potential “glimmerings,” such as nanotechnology and fracking, the latter of which inspired him to make a documentary and write a book.
Gingrich concludes that the development of AI at Carnegie Mellon could be one of such “glimmerings,” with the potential to “give us new capabilities and new insights in ways we have never imagined.” That being said, Gingrich does echo the aforementioned fear many hold that “artificial intelligence will displace many traditional service jobs,” a societal shift that will necessitate a “rethink [of] adult education.”
Gingrich’s visit and subsequent opinion piece for Fox News shows that he not only sees the future as something bright due to some of the innovative work being done here at Carnegie Mellon University, but also recognizes that these innovations will come at a cost.
One cost he does not mention is the disputed negatives of shale fracking for natural gas, a technology that has allowed the United States to be more energy efficient, but one that has had major growing pains including improper waste management, increased seismic activity in areas of drilling, and well water contamination — although he compared fracking’s benefits to the benefits of the technologies being developed here at Carnegie Mellon.
His equating of fracking technology to the work being done in nanotechnology or AI here at Carnegie Mellon University is a somewhat dubious claim, as fracking has certainly not been as flawless as the portrait he paints, especially as he uses these points to bolster the claim that former President Barack Obama was “of course... totally wrong” in regard to the technology, simultaneously advertising his past documentary on the subject matter.
All this being said, it is important to have influential personalities like Gingrich aware of the work being done in places like Carnegie Mellon University. Regardless of political affiliation, an understanding of breakthrough technologies and the future of the workforce and economy are vital for all to understand. Gingrich’s visit, his working relationship with Dr. Kiron Skinner, and his writing for Fox News all contribute to the vital discussion of how technological advancements and public policy considerations can and must intersect.

One of Carnegie Mellon University’s most exciting and most critically acclaimed events, the Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival, is underway. Beginning March 22 and running until April 8, the festival will include a vast array of films from across the world, as well as moderated discussions, a short film competition, and even Q&As with directors.
The Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival is a unique event in Pittsburgh, bringing together films from all over the world to convey a cohesive theme and paint a fascinating picture of the world of film.
The Tartan interviewed Jolanta Lion, the director of the festival and the assistant director of the Humanities Center, who also mentioned that this festival is the only international film festival in the world “where students are behind coordinating and bringing premieres of world-class cinema to its festival lineup.”
The various events that comprise this distinct festival aren’t just held here at Carnegie Mellon University, but also across Pittsburgh at Carlow University and at the Carnegie Museum of Art Theatre. That being said, receptions and the majority of screenings take place right here on campus, in McConomy Auditorium.
This year’s festival has the theme and title “Faces of (In)equality.” Lion describes that themes are chosen “based on how globally relevant [they are] and if people all over the world are currently telling stories that relate to the theme.”
In the wake of the Donald Trump’s 2016 election, the “current social and political climate regarding race, gender, nationality” has changed, Lion explains. Situations like the “Muslim ban, the Women’s March, and Charlottesville [have] heightened our awareness of the concept of equality,” she continues.
The festival does its very best to look at these potent societal issues, like that of inequality, and see how they are being represented across the world in film. This is a tall order for those who select the films.
In order to be included in the festival, films need to have “not yet been screened in Pittsburgh,” be connected to the theme, and are reviewed with careful scrutiny by the festival’s programming team, Lion explained.
The selected films for this year certainly fit into this, with films subjects including the effects of the Charlottesville alt-right protests, how an Indian doctor broke into the world of medicine, the marginalization of people of color in the United States, how mass migration changes the world, and countless others.
Some past years’ festival themes have been “Faces of Work” in 2015, “Faces of Migration” in 2011, and “Faces of Mechanization” in 2008. Looking forward, Lion stresses the importance of “forming new relationships with [Carnegie Mellon] schools and departments, other schools and universities, and local organizations,” thereby connecting to the Pittsburgh community and being able to “provoke conversation across a more diversified audience.”
Such an interesting event does not go by without attracting praise from throughout the community. Barry Paris, film critic for the Pittsburgh Post Gazette calls the festival his “annual favorite, due to the excellence of the choices by its director, Jolanta Lion, who deserves an Oscar in general.”
Likewise, Michael Machosky of the Pittsburgh Tribune Review describes it as “one of Pittsburgh’s most unusual and consistently interesting film festivals.” Such praise and acclaim comes at the cost of the tireless work done by director Jolanta Lion and many student volunteers who work to provide the community such a well-run event.
If you’ve not been able to attend any of the screenings, Q&As, or discussions in these past few weeks, the festival will continue to run until Sunday, April 8. Tickets for regular admission screenings are $10, and $5 for students with appropriate identification.
Some forthcoming events include a screening of Risk, a Laura Poitras film on Julian Assange on April 4, and the next day, a screening of Mali Blues, a Lutz Gregor film on Malian musicians, among other films as well.
The festival will conclude on Sunday, April 8, with a screening of Human Flow, a film directed by renowned Chinese protest artist Ai Weiwei, as well as a panel discussion of the film and a closing night reception.
These films, stylistically and topically diverse, combine in the festival setting to create a fascinating picture of the world in which we live, and do so with emphasis on both equality and inequality. This focus allows attendees to “observe, discuss, and experience international cultures,” the festival website states.
In the continuously globalizing world we occupy, understanding and experiencing other cultures can be imperative to our society as a whole. Though not the only means to improving and connecting the world, events like the Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival certainly help. We are lucky to have it here in Pittsburgh.

Closing in on the six-month anniversary of Hurricane Maria’s landfall in Puerto Rico, a group of Carnegie Mellon students led by Tiffany Taulton, a graduate student in Heinz College majoring in public policy, visited the island on an “alternative spring break.” The group, besides bringing donations to help the island, spent the week helping some of the most vulnerable segments of the Puerto Rican population and learning about the fragile nature of the island’s natural ecosystems. In an interview with The Tartan, Taulton gave a summary of the trip’s activities and her reflections on the island’s current condition.
Taulton, who spent part of her childhood in Puerto Rico when her father was stationed there, immediately noticed improvements as her flight approached the island. “Flying over San Juan, I noticed there did not seem to be quite as many blue tarps [temporary roofs for homes damaged by the hurricane] as there had been when I’d last come in November [with Carnegie Mellon student Rosana Guernica],” she recalled, which made her feel that “there had been some progress” on the island. “Even the trees seemed to be trying to leaf out,” she said. But, it was evident that the recovery was still in progress because she still saw many blue tarps and broken branches on the roads once she had landed.
On their first full day, the group visited Caño Martín Peña, a tidal channel that connects San Juan Bay to Laguna San Jose and Laguna Los Corozos, where they learned about its history, ecological significance, and the many issues plaguing the area and its residents. According to the Environmental Protection Agency’s website, this tidal channel is heavily polluted from waste material and sewage that gets discharged directly into it. Residents near the channel are exposed to these harmful chemicals due to flooding from the lack of adequate drainage, causing everything from skin lesions to asthma to cancer. One part of the channel — which in the past had been over 200 feet wide — was so heavily damaged that it was now only two feet wide and about one foot deep, and it even hosted a mini-forest of small trees.
“It was heartbreaking to see all the turtles swimming in the stagnant, smelly water that bubbled from all the organic material that filled it,” said Taulton. She remembered that “one student asked why they didn’t just cut down the trees [in the mini-forest] and unblock the stream. The guide said that the area was so toxic that you had to wear a hazmat suit to work in it, and no one could touch it until the Army Corps of Engineers finished their study and Congress released the funds to begin the dredging.” The combination of government red tape and the island’s financial woes meant that the residents were hoping that the restoration of the channel would be done by 2029.
As government assistance to improve the channel’s condition and install sewage infrastructure has been practically nonexistent, the eight communities there — known as “G-8” — have formed their own group, the Caño Martín Peña Land Trust, to improve the environment and prevent gentrification of the neighborhoods in the midst of Puerto Rico’s economic crisis. The trust was awarded the 2015 U.N. Habitat Award for its work.
Taulton said that the Carnegie Mellon students went on a bicycle tour, “learning about the solar panels and computers that were donated to community centers that the G-8 volunteers used to help the largely illiterate residents complete their FEMA forms and charge their phones so they could check on their family members after the hurricane.” While the larger-scale restoration plans dragged on, the community has been making its own efforts to improve the landscape, such as by planting flowers along the water to beautify the area and keep people from dumping trash there. However, the group didn’t see the flowers because the hurricane had stripped them away. “There was just bare ground and an algae-filled stream when we arrived,” she said.
However, it was not all bad news. A success story from the Martin Pena communities was their recycling enterprise. It was so successful that the government of San Juan contracted it to reduce the waste output of other communities.
The next location they visited was Utuado, a municipality located in the mountains where Hurricane Maria left the island. It sustained some of the worst damage from the hurricane — bridges and roads were destroyed, and many of the residents did not yet have electricity restored when the Carnegie Mellon group arrived. 
There, the students learned about ecotourism on a tour with Jorge Perez, who runs Batey Zip-line Adventures. They hiked on coffee plantations and across a suspension bridge built by Perez, zip-lined, and rappelled down a cliff to a riverbed where they swam and kayaked into a cave. 
“Sadly, the cave exit was blocked by debris that had been swept down by the swollen river, so we couldn’t go all the way through. But, that gave us more time to appreciate the spooky darkness and the sounds. We heard the familiar coqui, the island’s signature special frog — smaller than your pinky nail but with a voice that would make you swear it was 20 feet tall,” Taulton recalled. However, something that was noticeably absent were the bats — many of which were likely either killed during the storm or flew away.
The next day they helped Perez on his farm. She explained in the interview that not only was Perez’s farm produce entirely organic and chemical free, Perez had developed a system of raised beds to get around the rocky soil, keep plants watered, and prevent rains from washing the farm away. He also raised worms for the soil and his wife used the vegetables in the cafe they owned. He worried that with the next hurricane season approaching, the island could plunge into deeper crisis with so many still recovering from Maria. The students helped build four new raised beds on his farm.
After that, they helped a farmer in Arecibo, Jaime Jordan, clear his field of invasive weeds that took root after Maria. “His family lost their house as a result of the hurricane, and they have since been living in his toolshed. He and his wife were embarrassed by their condition and did not want to have us help them at first, but then they decided that as students, we were mentally prepared for what we would see and would want to learn,” Taulton remembered. Yet, when asked what more the students could do to help him, Jordan only answered that others needed help more than he did. “[Jordan] felt the most important thing we could do was to tell others about what we saw, and to teach people about the importance of protecting the islands’ water system...[he] wants people to come back to the mountains and care for the land,” Taulton stated.
The group also met with faculty and students from the University of Puerto Rico in Mayaguez (UPRM), where both the Carnegie Mellon group and the UPRM group presented their research on sustainability. The faculty at UPRM also took them to three communities in Anasco, where they helped clear a community garden of debris and weeds and donated their clothing to help those in need. “The teachers were so grateful for our decision to come to Puerto Rico to help after the hurricane that they insisted that we cancel our reservations at the university dorm and stay in their luxury apartments in the famous beach town of Cabo Rojo!” Taulton said.
The students helped repaint a school to convert it to a community center in Humacao, where Maria had entered the island and where many residents still had no electricity. “Painting the school may not have felt as sexy as farming, but it was a nice change to be out of the hot sun for a while!” Taulton said. A small subset of the group also went to meet with Puerto Rico Off Grid Solar Relief, a group led by Alberto Casas that aimed to restore power using solar panels and bought freezers for those who needed it. “Many of the cables and connectors for the panels...are very expensive to get in Puerto Rico, so we brought a suitcase full of them that I had bought online using funds that were donated to us. [Casas] was so shocked and happy to see them, that he completely stopped talking for a few minutes while he opened up all the boxes,” Taulton said.
The group was amazed by the resilience and accomplishments of the Puerto Ricans they met, despite the lack of federal aid some areas have received. “People in communities were rallying together, but with another hurricane season just a few months away, and no large-scale federal government response on the horizon, they will continue to need help from ordinary people like us,” she said. The campus community can learn more about Puerto Rico’s situation and help out in a variety of ways. San Juan mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz will be attending Energy Week and will be present at a fundraiser event for Rosana Guernica’s work to help the island. Besides these, there are already plans for another trip to Puerto Rico next year.

Earlier in March, the Board of Trustees voted unanimously to make Farnam Jahanian the 10th President of Carnegie Mellon University. After a long and combined effort between student leaders and the board, then Interim President Jahanian remained the favorite for the job, as he has served as the interim president for the past semester. Before serving as the 10th president, he served as the Provost and Chief Academic Officer.
He started his path to leadership by serving as National Science Foundation Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering. In this position, he managed a massive budget and pushed to increase access and innovation in technology and science. Though his alma mater is the University of Texas at Austin, he has been devoted to Carnegie Mellon for decades and made great efforts to increase the quality and consistency of education for all students on campus.
Many students view him as a genuine and charismatic person that cares deeply about the issues surrounding the students and faculty and staff. John Solomon, a sophomore in chemical engineering, said "I've talked with Jahanian once, and he has a genuine commitment to the school."
Some of these issues concern campus life as well as financial aid. A student, who wished to remain anonymous, found that "it would be great if he could contribute more funds towards reducing student tuition costs." However, there is reason to believe that President Jahanian will be able to tackle those issues directly. 
For many sophomores and freshmen, President Jahanian is the only president they really know. When asked about what they remembered about former President Subra Suresh, an anonymous sophomore said that "the only thing I remember about president Subra Suresh are the memes." However, perhaps, this is an indictment of the transparency of the office of president and the responsibilities of the president. Pavi Bhatter, a freshman in information systems, believes that "[President] Jahanian will help to foster positive relations between the administration and [the student body]."
Thought students may not feel a daily impact from the decisions of the office of the president, he has the support of a student body eager to see his plans for the university.

The third and final event of the Undergraduate Student Senate’s First Lectures Series is being held on April 26, 2018 from 8 to 9 p.m. in the Connan room. The First Lectures Series is run by the Campus Life Committee of the Student Senate to capture the life lessons, experiences, and perspectives of the graduating senior class as a parallel to Randy Pausch’s Last Lecture.
So far this semester, we have heard from Justis Hibshman, Kevin Wainczak, Gaby Cach, and Shreya Desikan. This final event will feature Tara Stentz and Apeksha Atal, two seniors with truly exceptional and inspiring stories.
Tara Stentz is an electrical and computer engineering major who is planning on working for the Uber Advanced Technology Group on their self-driving cars after graduation. She will be talking about how she had always loved math since she was a little girl, but didn’t feel like a good fit for Carnegie Mellon’s Electrical and Chemical Engineering major, because she was also a theater girl and no one in her major shared her interests. She will be emphasizing the importance of embracing uniqueness and refusing to hide parts of herself, even when she feels like she doesn’t belong.
Apeksha Atal is a biology and english major who is planning on spending the summer traveling and working on business analytics and content development at her mom’s company and working on publishing the novella she is writing for her senior thesis. She will be talking about her experiences with the concept of permanence, through the lens of her process of choosing a tattoo. She will be exploring the role of certainty and the lack thereof in her emotional, social, occupational, and academic life, as well as how she has come to embrace growth and the fact that the past cannot be changed.
Come support these speakers and learn from their experiences by coming to the event on April 26! Any questions may be directed to Rohini Sinha (rsinha1@andrew.cmu.edu). If you would like to be notified when speaker nominations and events are open next semester, follow our Facebook page, Carnegie Mellon Student Senate.

Today, it seems that acts of violence are so commonplace in our lives that we have almost become accustomed to them. Acts of terror, specifically, have become such typical parts of our lives that — while they still raise questions of “why?”, “how?”, and “when will this end?” — they are now unsurprising stories on our news broadcasts and Twitter feeds. But what about how these events are covered? How has media coverage impacted what we see, what we know, and how we perceive what has happened?
In March 2018, Austin, TX was terrorized by suspected bomber Mark Conditt who killed himself in the seventh and final bombing on March 21. Coverage of these attacks has been widespread in the media from The New York Times to The Atlantic. However, the amount of coverage has been nowhere near that of the bombings in Paris, Brussels, the Boston Marathon, or the shooting in the Orlando nightclub, Pulse. The language and methods used to cover the bombings and Conditt himself have also been markedly different than others. Discussion about how coverage differs has also been ignited by the fact that the two victims of the bombings are African Americans.
Conditt has been described as a white Christian, a “nerdy” man from a “godly family.” While all these terms may be accurate, a New York Times tweet highlighted these facts — a distinct difference from how the media covers acts of terror by Muslims or victims of color.
According to a 2017 study from Georgia State University, an attack by a Muslim perpetrator receives four and a half times more coverage than an attack by a non-Muslim perpetrator. The study analyzed the coverage of 89 attacks and found that, while only 12 percent of the attacks were by Muslims, those attacks by Muslims received 44 percent of the total coverage of all 89 attacks. Coverage was also much more widespread if the perpetrator was Muslim and foreign-born.
After the Boston Marathon bombing on April 13, 2013, The New York Post published its April 18 issue with an image of two young men with the large headline “Bag Men,” claiming they were the perpetrators of the bombing ostensibly because of their outward appearance. The real bombers, brothers Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, were discovered, and the two men falsely accused eventually settled a defamation suit with the paper.
Rarely does anyone call a white perpetrator a terrorist. Since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, the terms “terrorist” and “terrorism” have become part of American lexicon, but are associated with Muslims. The fact that labeling an otherwise innocent Muslim a terrorist is easier than rightfully calling a white person a terrorist speaks volumes about the stereotypes and views America has about Muslims.
This racist coverage also extends to shooters and African Americans. White shooters are considered lone wolves, called mentally ill and given layered backstories, in an attempt to understand and humanize them. While these profiles may have some validity by seeking to understand the psychology of these men, this sympathy is not given to Muslim or black shooters. They are immediately called terrorists and thugs, indicted on malicious intent rather than outside forces out of their control. 
Even black victims receive more negative coverage than white shooters. Young teenage African Americans victims are called men and given part of the blame. The most widely circulated photo of Trayvon Martin is black and white, of him looking blankly at the camera in a white hoodie. What if instead of this image we saw another photograph of Martin in a red Hollister t-shirt and smiling? Would that have altered our perception of him? We’ll never know. 
Three months after the Boston Marathon bombing, bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the brother who survived and stood trial, was on the cover of Rolling Stone. The headline called him the bomber and a monster, but the photograph itself was more positive — it was well lit and relatively flattering, with Tsarnaev’s hair flowing in curling tresses. While Tsarnaev is Muslim, he is of Chechen descent — the original Caucasians. The question of whether he was white or not was debated as his trial began. The simple fact that he was featured on the cover of a prestigious cultural magazine like a celebrity has enough implications of slanted coverage.
After the shooting of nine African Americans in a Charleston, SC church in June 2015, The Washington Post made the argument about the inequality of how the media covers mass violence, pointing out the coverage of shooter Dylann Roof. However, almost three years later, media coverage has not changed. In a press conference after Austin bomber Conditt’s death, the Austin Police Chief called him a “challenged young man.” Only eight days later, after extensive criticism, did the police chief call Conditt a domestic terrorist.
This needs to change. The way the media covers perpetrators of mass violence is directly connected to how we view them as a society. These immediate racist connections we make by equating Muslims to terrorists and black people to criminals are ingrained in our minds. The idea that America is past racism is not a moot point. It remains an immutable part of our society. The media directly impacts how we think — it’s how we get our news, how we learn about what’s going on in the world. The information we receive influences how we perceive the world. In order to become a more equal society, we must move towards more equal media coverage of atrocious attacks.

Thirteen Korean beauty products have been taken off the shelves after high levels of antimony were found. At first glance, this may appear to be just another recall. However, when looking at the recalled products, one can see that a significant portion of them came from brands that perform animal testing. Animal testing is performed in hopes to ensure the safety of different products, whether it be new medicines or cleaning supplies or, in this case, cosmetics. However, the fact that brands that tested on animals appeared to have the same proportion of products recalled in comparison to their non-tested counterparts raises the question: how effective is animal testing?
The brand Amorepacific produced about half of the recalled products, yet it tests on animals "if animal testing is required or bound by local governments or laws." Similarly, many other brands on the list, such as Black Monster and Etude House, are pressured by laws to test their finished products on animals. The purpose of such laws is to protect people from potentially harmful products, yet somehow animal testing was not enough to stop these products from ending up on the list more than their cruelty-free counterparts.
Animal testing involves taking live animals and putting them under harsh circumstances. For testing the efficacy of a new drug, animals, many of which are genetically modified, may be deliberately placed under distressful situations or otherwise harmed in hopes that the researchers can learn something about the drug. In the realm of soaps and detergents, animals' fur will be ripped off and the bare skin will be exposed to potentially harsh chemicals. The list of ways animals are tested on goes on, but nearly all of them end with the researcher euthanizing the tested animals.
In 2016, India's government banned animal testing for Indian companies that produce soap, cosmetics, and detergents. However, there have been no adverse effects on the people in this regard. Furthermore, the European Union banned animal testing in 2013. This includes a testing band and a marketing ban, which prohibits the testing or selling of animal-tested finished products and their respective ingredients. Again, we fail to see a rise in recalls or any sign of concern pertaining to safety.
Animal testing isn't even the cost-friendly way to go when it comes to testing the safety of products. As of 2013, it was estimated that the U.S. spends anywhere between $12 billion to $14.5 billion on animal testing. While safety should come before monetary cost, it is important to remember that the accuracy of animal testing may not be the best. In vitro testing is up to twelve times more cost efficient in comparison to animal testing and does not involve an invasive procedure that infringes on a sentient being's life.
Alternatively, testing using paid human clients is another alternative. At first, testing on humans may seem to be less ethical than testing on an animal, but this level of heightened caution that researchers feel about testing on humans may provide heightened incentive to be more cautious about testing. On the participants' end, participants must give consent to be a part of the procedure and may withdraw at any point they choose, a freedom that animal subjects do not have. Additionally, humans can hold the researchers accountable. Should any ethical guideline be broken, they can take the researchers to court; such justice is much harder to do for animals.
What we learn from such studies is nothing to scoff at. Participant-based studies have allowed cosmetic brands to test out new products that consumers can enjoy. Case studies involving human participants allow us to learn more about the efficacies of new medicines and treatments. The world of possibilities exceeds what we can imagine, but we are confined by the mentality that animal testing is the best testing method.
With all these cons, why do we continue to test on animals? Many brands and companies are able to skip the animal cruelty at a hefty price: cutting mainland China's population out of their consumer population. Currently, China (excluding Hong Kong) is the only nation that mandates animal testing. Part of the reason lies in their attempt to combat counterfeit products that may be circulating the market. Many of these counterfeit products are not held to the same safety standard that reputable brands must undergo, thus being potentially hazardous to consumers.
However, as mentioned previously, animal testing is not the most efficient or ethical method of ensuring product safety. Instead of requiring reputable brands to test on animals, perhaps a good step towards countering the damage of counterfeit products is to have tighter copyright laws that protect brands.
China is projected to be the largest cosmetics market. Denying a market that is currently $29 billion is a significant loss that cruelty-free brands must accept in order to avoid testing on animals. However, there is room for hope. In 2014, The Chinese Food and Drug Administration claimed it would begin to be more open to alternative testing methods and waived animal testing for some non-special-use cosmetics, such as nail care and perfumes. In Sept. 2016, China’s Zhejiang Institute for Food and Drug Control opened a lab in collaboration with the Institute for In Vitro Sciences, a U.S. non-profit. Together, Chinese scientists have been trained to test using reconstructed skin cells. If this progress continues and China lifts its animal testing policy, companies will greatly lose any incentive to test on animals.
Scientific discoveries allow us to find new solutions to problems and improve the future. Animal testing may have, at one point, been the most ethical way to ensure the public's safety. However, that is not the case anymore. Just as our technology is evolving, so should our methods of testing.

About a year ago, I wrote an article in The Tartan about race and privilege. In the piece, I argued that all white people are inherently privileged and systemically racist. The article seemed to be mostly positively received, but I found that I had to explain and defend my argument to some of my friends — ones who strike me as good people who genuinely care about correcting systems of oppression — more than I had expected to, before they could get it. It seemed that the words “racist” and “privileged” meant something different to them than what I had intended.
After thinking more about activist language, I have come to the conclusion that the word “privilege” does not effectively communicate what activists want it to. In the word’s normal usage, a “privilege” is something extra that must be earned. Privileges are different from rights in that they are unnecessary benefits. For instance, access to clean water is a right, while access to designer handbags is a privilege. When liberal activists describe “white privilege” or “male privilege,” however, we use the word “privilege,” but we are actually talking about things that are really more akin to human rights.
In Peggy McIntosh’s 1988 essay “White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack,” which helped originally popularize the term “white privilege,” McIntosh lists some of the everyday “privileges” she experiences as a white person: “I can turn on the television or open to the front page of the paper and see people of my race widely represented…I can go into a music shop and count on finding the music of my race represented, into a supermarket and find the staple foods that fit with my cultural traditions, into a hairdresser’s shop and find someone who can cut my hair...I can be sure that if I need legal or medical help, my race will not work against me.”
For the most part, McIntosh’s list consists of things that every American deserves and every person needs to live a happy, healthy, fulfilling life — that is, rights — but McIntosh refers to them as “privileges.” Calling these sorts of things “privileges” makes it sound like not everyone deserves them. The point of activism like McIntosh’s is to expand access to these necessary benefits, not to take away access from the people who already have them, so it would intuitively make more sense to refer to these benefits as rights, which are universally deserved and should be freely given, rather than privileges, which are not deserved by anyone and must be earned.
Often times, when we talk about “privileges,” we really mean to be talking about a marginalized group’s disadvantages. For instance, a popular tweet from tech entrepreneur William LeGate about the recent Austin bombings, which primarily focuses on people of color, mentions white privilege but is actually discussing minority disadvantages. In his tweet, LeGate writes, "White privilege is when a single dog dying on a plane gets 10x the media coverage of [five] targetted [sic] bombings of minorities in America via domestic terrorist(s).” The main message of this tweet is that minorities are disadvantaged in America because the media seems to care less about their lives than those of animals. Many people who read the tweet were confused, though, because LeGate uses the term “white privilege,” but there were no white people explicitly mentioned in the tweet to have that privilege. One person even jokingly replied, “The dog was white?” This confusion is caused by the fact that LeGate is thinking of a disadvantage but using the word “privilege.” LeGate’s tweet is not an isolated instance, though. In this tweet, as well as in many other instances, it would be clearer to frame the discussion in terms of minority disadvantages or human rights violations rather than privileges.
While calling crucial benefits “privileges” is intuitively contradictory to the aims of liberal activism, doing so fits neatly with the narrative of white supremacists and white nationalists. These groups believe that the white race is under attack and must be violently defended. An example of this narrative in action is the phrase that has been circulating these communities lately, “It’s okay to be white,” which has been recently appearing on fliers at college and university campuses all over the U.S. This phrase shows what these white power groups think their opponents are arguing — “It’s okay to be white” has the underlying implication that someone has said that it’s not okay to be white, since, otherwise, “It’s okay to be white” would not be a worthwhile statement to make. White power groups justify themselves with the idea that liberals hate white people and want to oppress them. When we use the term “white privilege” to describe the human rights currently not granted to people of color, we support this white power narrative because the word “privilege” inherently implies undeservedness.
Having these human rights that we call “privileges” respected by society is a good thing: it’s great that men can walk down a street without feeling afraid; it’s great that white children grow up with access to strong education; it’s great that straight couples can show affection in public without fearing violent repercussions. What’s not great, what liberal activism focuses on, is that marginalized groups do not have access to these same freedoms. We must shape our language to reflect this purpose by calling these benefits “rights” rather than “privileges.”
With widespread systems of oppression still deeply pervasive in the world, liberal activists need widespread support and can’t afford to lose any of that support because of ineffective communication.

Have you liked Carnegie Mellon Memes for Spicy Teens? If so, Facebook knows about it. Facebook collects data from all of your activity, from likes to personal information to events you attend. Only recently, however, did we find out the extent to which this data is used to manipulate us. A recent scandal involving Facebook has revealed an unprecedented invasion of privacy that is raising a serious question of how we, as a society, are going to deal with data privacy. 
According to The New York Times, it all started with Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American psychology professor at Cambridge University. Kogan received permission from Facebook to collect data for academic research. He created an app, thisisyourdigitallife, that paid Facebook users to answer a survey. However, the app didn’t only collect the data of users who consented to the survey; it scraped data from every user’s network of friends, expanding the data set from 270,000 profiles to 50 million. 
Enter Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm. Cambridge Analytica bought the data from Kogan and started categorizing the users with a complex technique developed at Cambridge University. They used the data to build highly specific personality profiles. With an unprecedented understanding of their target audience, Cambridge Analytica crafted advertisements and political campaign materials that delved into the heart of each user’s fears and beliefs, allegedly influencing the Brexit decision and swinging the election in Donald Trump’s favor. 
According to The Guardian, Facebook’s policy “allowed only a collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising.” Cambridge Analytica and Kogan clearly violated these terms, and Facebook removed the app from the site in 2015. They also requested that everyone with access to the user data to delete it immediately. 
Facebook’s actions may seem reassuring, but they were only the bare minimum. There were several steps Facebook could’ve taken to ensure user security, but they failed to do so. For example, they did not warn their users that their data may have been collected, even though a majority of American states have laws requiring notification in cases of data breach. Facebook may have escaped this regulation through their insistent claims that it was not a breach, but quibbling about terminology brings very little comfort to compromised users. 
Furthermore, Facebook failed to certify that the data was deleted. According to Christopher Wylie, the former Director of Research at Cambridge Analytica, Facebook only sent a letter asking him to destroy the data. The Guardian reports that Wylie did not answer the letter for weeks, and Facebook did nothing to pursue an answer. When Wylie agreed to destroy the data, Facebook took him at his word, failing to follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage. 
“That to me was the most astonishing thing,” Wylie said. “They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”
Tensions about data privacy have been simmering for years, and now they are bursting into the spotlight. News of the scandal recently found its way through dozens of reputable news sites. Senators and public figures weighed in to voice their concerns. Facebook’s shares plummeted. According to The New York Times, the British Information Commissioner’s Office is doing an inquiry into the relationship between Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. 
Now, we have an important decision to make about data privacy. We can hand wave the scandal away, claiming that it’s just part of using social media. Several people I know are tempted to do so, saying things like, “I already figured stuff like that was happening behind the scenes. It’s not that big of a deal.”
But, it is a big deal. Our current state of politics can attest to that. 
The problem isn’t that ads have a target audience, it’s that the ads are meticulously crafted using ill-gained information. It’s not that our decisions are influenced, it’s that millions of decisions are influenced to sway the course of politics and history. It’s not that Facebook has our information, it’s that they treat it carelessly and let it fall into unscrupulous hands. It’s not that Facebook made a mistake, it’s that the company was careless, skirting laws and turning a blind eye in the pursuit of power and profits.
Of course, some responsibility lies on the shoulders of the users. We have to be discerning when dealing with advertisements and political propaganda, critically engaging with the material that finds its way onto our Facebook feed. But, we also should be able to browse social media without worrying that liking a page about curly fries will result in an onslaught of hyper specific campaign ads.  
So yes, we could dismiss the scandal. Or we could fight for higher levels of transparency, increased protections of privacy, and data use regulations. It is within our rights to demand a higher quality product from a company that serves our needs, and it is practically our duty to engage with a tech giant that wields real influence over the state of our world. If Facebook agrees, then I’ll happily scroll down my feed. If not, then there are other ways to know what my friends are up to. 
I’ve made my decision. Now I’m just waiting for Facebook to make theirs.
