The Carnegie Mellon women's volleyball team hosted the Crossover Tournament last weekend, competing against Trine University, John Carroll University, Allegheny College, and Johns Hopkins University. The Tartans finished with a record of 3–1, defeating Trine, Allegheny, and Johns Hopkins, and moved to 7–5 overall.
The Tartans began their Friday night by topping Trine 3–1, with scores of 25–23, 25–19, 21–25, and 25–14. The second and the fourth games of this series were especially exciting to see. Seniors Aislinn McCloskey (12 kills and four blocks) and Caroline Size (10 kills and five digs) led the team. Fellow senior Cameron Griffin managed 18 digs on the defensive side. First-year Rachel Miller also made a huge contribution with 10 kills, seven digs, and one block assist. First-year Olivia Mora added four block assists while junior Maddie Rosnick made three. First-year Emily Wright and sophomore Kasey LaMothe made 27 and 16 assists, respectively.
The second game of Friday evening was against John Carroll, where Carnegie Mellon lost 3–0, with games of 26–24, 25–19, and 25–19. The ladies had some success, with Size making eight kills and Wright tallying 18 assists and 10 digs. Griffin also picked up 18 digs. At the end of the day, however, the Tartans couldn't break through to overcome John Carroll.
On Saturday, the Tartans' luck turned around as Carnegie Mellon won both matches against Allegheny and Hopkins. The 3–1 victory over Allegheny was aided by Miller, who contributed 17 kills, followed by Rosnick with 11. Wright picked up 42 assists and three service aces. On the defensive side, Griffin seized 14 digs. First-year Ali Nichols and junior Kristen Castellano both contributed 13 digs, and Rosnick made four block assists. While the first two games were close, at 23–25 and 25–21, the Tartans had more stamina and finished strong with two victories of 25–17 and 25–12.
After the match against Allegheny, the Tartans continued their winning streak by crushing Johns Hopkins in a 3–0 victory, with matches of 25–21, 25–9, and 25–16. McCloskey added 13 kills, followed by Miller with 12. Wright and Griffin picked up 14 and 20 digs, respectively, while Nichols added 13 more. First-year Senna Parsa made five blocks, while Rosnick and Mora made four each.
Great teamwork is what pushed the Tartans ahead at the end of the day. Every kill and block was met with a loud cheer and a round of high fives from encouraging teammates.
With the success of the Crossover Tournament, the Tartans' record now stands at 7–5. Look for the women's volleyball team later this week as Carnegie Mellon takes on Point Park University on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in Skibo Gymnasium.

Seven games into the season, the men’s soccer team has been able to come up with a win each time. The last time the Tartans started off 7–0 was back in 2003 under the realm of former head coach Nick Gaudioso. The team’s exceptional start to the season has put them at an imposing third in the NSCAA/*HendrickCars.com* Division III rankings, the highest in the school’s history.
This past week, the Tartans traveled to Colorado for a two-day tournament held at Colorado College. Friday, the Tartans played the hosts of the tournament in what ended as another convincing win for Carnegie Mellon Junior forward Kyle Young set the tone of the match by scoring an early goal. Midway through the first half, the first-year duo of Joey Paladino and Max Tassano struck in back-to-back minutes to give the Tartans a 3–0 lead. 
The Tigers of Colorado College remained rather quiet in their attack, as their main threat, sophomore forward Matt Fechter, was shut down by Carnegie Mellon’s center backs sophomore Moni Sallam and junior Nick Gianopoulos. The Tigers went on to net a consolation goal in the second half, but Carnegie Mellon prevailed in the end with a 3–1 victory.
The next day, Carnegie Mellon faced Wheaton College in what turned out to be a much tougher match. Ninety minutes wasn’t enough to determine the winner of the match, and the game fell into overtime where junior midfielder Carmen Minella became the hero of the day, scoring early and getting the Tartans the 1–0 victory.
The trip to Colorado turned out to be another confidence builder for Carnegie Mellon. The Tartans are now halfway done with their tough six-game road schedule, and will be eyeing the No. 1 spot in NSCAA/*HendrickCars.com* Division III rankings in the upcoming weeks. The Colorado tournament also proved to be a challenging fitness test for the men’s team, as there was a 7,000-foot increase in altitude.
“The experience was pretty interesting. We had to be quick to adjust to the climate,” sophomore forward Alex Abedian said. “After the first couple of laps around the field, coach [Arron Lujan] said he saw it in our eyes that the altitude was taking a toll on us. But once we found our feet and began playing, it got a bit easier.”
The Tartans look to continue their great start as they face Grove City College this upcoming Saturday.

The Carnegie Mellon University football team finished their first home game with a loss last Saturday at Gesling Stadium. The Tartans fell to the Hobart College Statesmen in a 35–21 contest, which drops them to 1–2 while the Statesmen improve to 2–0.
The Tartans won the coin toss, electing to receive the ball. Sophomore Dave Birsen returned the ball 30 yards to the Carnegie Mellon 47-yard line. From there, the Tartans orchestrated an 11-play, 53-yard drive culminating in a 10-yard touchdown pass from first-year Rob Kalkstein to junior Chris Garcia. The drive gave Hobart the ball with 9:08 left in the quarter.
The Statesmen responded with their own eight-play, 80-yard drive, which took 3:14 off the clock. Running back Steven Webb rushed for a 2-yard touchdown. The Tartans got the ball back at the Hobart 48 after a 38-yard return by Birsen with 5:41 left. After a holding foul negated a first down and added yardage, the Tartans went three and out and gave the ball back to the Statesmen. Hobart began a 15-play, 76-yard drive that took them into the second quarter. When forced with a four and eight, quarterback Doug Vella rushed for 10 to keep the drive alive, and the drive ended with a rushing touchdown by Webb.
With 13:27 until the half, Hobart decided to kick on-sides, which was touched by the Tartans but was ultimately recovered by Hobart at the CMU 49. Vella threw a 49-yard touchdown pass to Garth Muratori, putting the Statesmen up 21–7. The Tartans received the ball at their 33, and ran three before the Statesmen forced a punt. The next drives by both teams were unsuccessful, as Vella was intercepted once and both team's defenses forced punts.
To start the third quarter, Hobart had a penalty called against them, which pushed their starting position. The Tartans forced a three and out, giving Carnegie Mellon the ball back at their own 38, but the Tartans were unable to get anything and chose to punt. The Statesmen received the ball at their 22, where Webb rushed for a 73-yard touchdown, putting Hobart up 28–7.
The Tartans went three and out again after amassing another penalty. The only points scored in the third quarter were Webb’s touchdown. The Statesmen had the ball to begin the fourth quarter, but were unable to do anything and punted.
The Tartans’ first drive picked up a first down but then stalled after Kalkstein was sacked for a four-yard loss; on third and long his pass was incomplete. Hobart’s next drive would put the Statesmen up 35-7, when Vella completed a 23-yard pass to Mike Lazore. The drive was five plays for 79 yards and gave the ball back to the Tartans at their 49 after a 44-yard return by sophomore Patrick Blanks.
The Tartans then staged a rally that began with sophomore Jared Delello’s 1-yard rushing touchdown on their next drive. Hobart’s next drive culminated with a blocked punt recovered by Hobart. The Tartans' next drive ended with their final score of the game, as Delello rushed for another 1-yard touchdown. They scored two unanswered touchdowns but were unable to overcome the deficit.
The Tartans were outgained 469–267 on offense, as Kalkstein finished the game five for 12 with 50 yards and one touchdown. Delello led the team in rushing for 82 yards and two touchdowns. Junior Ray Johnson led the team with nine tackles.
Carnegie Mellon is set to take on Kenyon College on Saturday. Kickoff is set for noon at Gesling Stadium.

Nearly a month into the season, it seems the women’s soccer team is a new force to be reckoned with. The Tartans traveled to Oberlin College last Saturday and came away with a decisive 6–2 win, putting their winning streak at four games and their overall record at 4–2. Sophomores Lissie Arndt and Mitra Ebrahimi led the team this game, collectively scoring five of the six goals. Junior Elsa Wu also had five shots on goal.
“I think the only difference between this game and previous ones was the score,” Arndt said. “We have had multiple scoring opportunities in previous games, and the fact that we capitalized on those in this game doesn’t reflect anything on our ability, or inability, to do the same in previous games. In truth, however, we did spend a large amount of time on attacking the end line with offensive support in practice this week.”
The action started eight minutes into the game, when Wu’s shot on the goal was saved  by Oberlin goalie Rachel Bandeira. Within seconds, Wu reclaimed the ball and assisted sophomore Brianna Magill’s first goal of the game to put the Tartans at 1–0. But the Yeomen only let the Tartans savor their lead for 27 seconds before they tied the score at 1–1. Both the Tartans and Yeomen kept a strong defense for the remainder of the period.
Carnegie Mellon turned up the heat in the second half of the game, blowing the Yeomen out of the water by scoring an additional five goals. Arndt tallied her first goal in the 53rd minute, putting the Tartans ahead 2–1. Seven minutes later, Ebrahimi headed in her first goal of the game with a corner kick assist from first-year Alex Venegas. Arndt kept the Tartans’ steamroller running, recording both her second and third goals during the 64th minute and setting the score at 5–1. After five substitutions, the Yeomen managed to respond to the three-goal gap with a point in the 76th minute. The Tartans took notice, and Ebrahimi scored her second goal of the game to make the final score 6–2. Strong defense kept Oberlin from closing the gap, and Carnegie Mellon walked off the field with a landslide victory.
“I am extremely hopeful for our season,” Arndt said. “Our team is talented, fit, and, most importantly, close. I believe that this family of mine can win [the UAA] conference and go far in the NCAAs.”
The Tartans will go head-to-head against the University of Mount Union at home tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.

Baseball season is almost over.
Welcome to the home stretch, folks. In merely two weeks, the regular season will be over and the postseason will begin. Which teams we will see playing October baseball will be decided in the next two weeks; not for a long time, though, have these next two weeks mattered so much for so many teams.
In 2007, the Mets seemingly gave their two weeks’ notice and played like a team resigned, losing a once-insurmountable division lead and missed the playoffs to the Phillies on the last day of the season. Meanwhile, in the National League (NL) West, Arizona, Colorado, and San Diego were all in a dogfight for both the division title and — with both the fading Mets and the fading Brewers — the NL wild card. Until those last two weeks, Colorado hadn’t even been a postseason afterthought, but with a remarkable 13–1 record down the stretch, the Rockies stormed into a one-game wild card showdown with the Padres, with Arizona barely eking out the division title. It was in that one-game, all-the-marbles playoff that the Rockies did what they’d done that season: They fell behind, seemingly doomed after losing the lead in the last inning, but rallied and won, sending themselves to the playoffs on a winning streak that wouldn’t end until the World Series.
How much crazier could that wild card have been? Consider this: Had the Mets won their last game of the season, they would have tied the Phillies with an 89–73 record. That, coincidentally, was the same record that the Padres and Rockies both finished with, which would’ve set up this scenario: a Mets-Phils one-game playoff, the winner of which went to the postseason as division champion, the loser of which would have played the winner of a one-game playoff between the Pads and Rox, and whoever won that final match would have been wild card champions. Two years ago, it was the American League (AL) Central that joined the NL wild card for the two-week drama. The White Sox tied the Twins for the division lead on Sept. 28, and the two went to a one-game playoff that the White Sox eventually won in dramatic fashion, sending them to the playoffs and sending the Twins home to prep themselves for a similar 2009. In the NL wild card race, the Mets, who had once again faded to cede the division lead to Philadelphia, were on pace to hit a playoff with the Brewers for the wild card title. But, again, the Mets lost to Florida on the final game of the season and Milwaukee won, avoiding what could have been another one-game wild card bonanza. Colorado, the comeback story of the year before, was nowhere to be seen; they’re certainly back this year, though.
The final weeks of 2009 saw only one truly tight race, as the Twins once again found themselves in a one-game playoff for the division title. This time they faced off against Detroit. After an intense game that remained tied from the eighth through the 12th, the Twins did what they couldn’t do the year before, winning the game and catapulting themselves into the postseason. The Rockies were once again wild card champions, though they didn’t take it in nearly as dramatic a fashion as they had two years prior.
Cue 2010. Once more, Colorado is ready to take baseball’s two weeks’ notice and show the world that they’d very much like to play on past September. Already the winners of 10 in a row, the Rockies entered Sunday’s action having won 13 of 17 games this month and trail the Padres by merely one game in the division and the Braves by 2.5 games in the wild card. They are riding on the back of shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, whose two-homer game on Saturday gave him a monstrous 14 home runs in 15 games. With San Diego finally floundering and the San Francisco Giants on-again, off-again, the Rockies look like they’re going to make this one even more memorable than 2007.
Atlanta, on the other hand, has its own battle to face. Similar to the Padres, the Braves enjoyed a comfortable division lead for most of the past few months before derailing in recent weeks. The Phillies have played their usual good September baseball and sat in first place by three games entering Sunday. Even though the Braves lead the wild card, the Rockies are certainly not making it easy, and the Braves seemingly have two uphill battles on their hands.
Strangely enough, the American League has no significant battles going into the last weeks of September. The only tight race is that between the Yankees and Rays for first place in the AL East; it doesn’t really matter, though, as whoever ends up in second will undoubtedly be the wild card champion.
So, regular season, your two weeks’ notice has been received. We look forward to what you can bring to the table in your final days, and expect nothing but good things when you are rehired come April.

After a disappointing third-place finish at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, it was clear that the rest of the world had caught up with Team USA’s basketball prowess. The “Redeem Team” re-established the United States’ success by taking gold in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. One week ago, USA Basketball completed a full comeback by winning the 2010 FIBA (International Basketball Federation) World Basketball Championship in Turkey. It was the first FIBA World Championship won by the U.S. since 1994. Even with an entirely different group of players from the Beijing ’08 team, Team USA shined in Turkey, winning many of their games in blowout fashion. With the championship, USA Basketball clearly asserted itself as the best international team and a powerful favorite for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.
The story from this year’s FIBA World Championship was that of domination from a youthful Team USA. Team USA had seven players on its roster under 24, and no players on the team were part of the 2008 Olympic gold medal-winning squad. The U.S. was led by 21-year-old Oklahoma City Thunder player Kevin Durant, who averaged a team-high 22.8 points per game. Other young stars included Durant’s Thunder teammate Russell Westbrook, Eric Gordon of the Los Angeles Clippers, and the Chicago Bulls’ Derrick Rose — all 21-year-olds who were third, fourth, and fifth on the team in scoring, respectively. The U.S. got its veteran leadership from the Denver Nuggets’ Chauncey Billups (age 33) and Los Angeles Lakers’ Lamar Odom (30). Billups was second on the team in scoring, with 9.8 points per game, and Odom led the team in rebounds with 7.7 per game. With its good leaders and blooming young crop of players, Team USA surpassed most expectations.
The U.S. went undefeated in pool play at the FIBA Championship, and then moved through the tournament of 16 to win the title. They won almost every game in a commanding way, with only two games closer than 10 points at the finish. They defeated host country Turkey, led by the Phoenix Suns’ Hedo Turkoglu, by 17 points in the championship game. Once again in the championship game, the U.S. was led by their young stars, who showed that Team USA will be a powerhouse for years to come. According to ESPN.com, President of USA Basketball Jerry Colangelo said about the championship, “It’s a great tribute to a young group of guys and some veteran leadership who really stepped up … and a great thing for USA Basketball because it got us over the hump.”
Durant was the player showing the most promise for the future of USA Basketball. He led the NBA in scoring this season with 30.1 points per game and almost took his Oklahoma City Thunder team past eventual champion L.A. Lakers in the playoffs. It is no longer fitting to categorize Durant as a budding young star, as he has established himself as one of the best players in the NBA and in the world. He had 28 points (including seven three-pointers) in the FIBA Championship game and won MVP of the tournament. This led ESPN.com writer Chris Sheridan to describe him as, “one of the most unstoppable forces on the planet.” Durant, however, could not have done it without his fellow teammates, many of whom, including Westbrook, Gordon, and Rose, are young enough to participate in two or three more Olympics and FIBA Championships.
Team USA’s 2010 world championship team was initially described as a ‘B’-grade team because of lack of international experience and star power. But this young group of players proved everyone wrong and played to itspotential in the FIBA tournament, becoming stars in the process. These players will still have to fight for spots on the 2012 Olympic Team with the likes of Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, but this summer they were able to regain USA Basketball’s international excellence and show that Team USA will be dominant for years to come.for years to come.

Seasoned senior inside linebacker and football team captain Mike Shedlosky is taking this season by storm. Shedlosky has been playing football for 14 years and is this week’s University Athletic Association (UAA) Football Defensive Athlete of the Week. Currently, he is ranked first in the UAA and second nationally for tackles. Shedlosky also tallied a career-best 19 tackles against Allegheny College and contributed to a Tartan win over Grove City College earlier this month.
Shedlosky is   a civil engineering major from Bridgewater, N.J. Civil engineering was always a field he wanted to pursue, so he was naturally drawn to Carnegie Mellon’s excellent program. Although not intending to factor football into his college decision process, he joined the team after head football coach Rich Lackner asked him to play. He was surprised by the quality of education Carnegie Mellon offered him, and he has particularly enjoyed studying under civil and environmental engineering professor Larry Cartwright. He also enjoys taking advantage of the resources the program offers, such as the high-tech facilities of the civil engineering computer clusters. As for the future, Shedlosky hopes to stay for another year to get his master’s degree or find a job at a consulting or design firm. “I definitely do not want to sit behind a desk the whole day,” he said.
Shedlosky is a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers, and, when not studying or playing football, he enjoys many recreational sports such as basketball, golf, and even rugby. He is also a brother of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. “I wouldn’t have had the same experiences if I didn’t join Beta,” Shedlosky said. He attributes his balanced routine to football season; since he has less free time during the season, he manages his time better. Although he is not a fan of the varying weather here in Pittsburgh, he is excited to hopefully get a job offer. Job offer aside, one of his long-term goals is to one day finish an Ironman.
With seven games left, Shedlosky has high hopes for the season. “Considering we are 1–2, we are one or two changes away from becoming a great team. The team is young, but I wouldn’t be surprised if we ended up 7–3 with a UAA conference title under our belt.”

Phone numbers, credit card numbers, passwords, and mailing addresses: These are all numbers that we deal with on a daily basis. As we grow from children to adults, how do we actually learn to remember these numbers? A recent study published in Psychological Science suggests that it’s more complex than simple memorization.
Robert Siegler, a professor of cognitive psychology at Carnegie Mellon, recently co-authored a study that describes how young children think about numbers. A better understanding of how numbers are represented in children’s minds will improve methods for teaching mathematics to young children and helping children with math-related learning disabilities.
“We found in previous experiments that the sense of magnitudes that children and adults have is strongly correlated with many aspects of their ability to work with numbers,” Siegler said, commenting on his motivation to conduct the study. Essentially, he wanted to know how children “see” and process numbers in their heads.
The study was conducted by asking preschoolers and second graders from Pittsburgh-area schools to perform certain tasks involving numbers. For instance, some children were given a sheet of paper with a line drawn on it; the left end of the line was labeled “0” and the right end of the line was labeled “20.” The children were then presented with the numbers one through 19 in random order and asked to guess the position of each number on the number line. Next, the children listened to several short audio scenes involving numbers and were tested on their ability to recall certain numbers from the scenes. Lastly, the children were tested on their ability to count and identify numbers.
The results showed that children generally visualized the number line in two different ways: one in which smaller numbers were more spaced out and larger numbers were closer together, and one in which the numbers were equally spaced apart. Researchers labeled these “logarithmic” and “linear,” respectively.
Interestingly, the children whose number lines were linear were able to better recall the numbers from the audio scenes than the children whose number lines were logarithmic. Large numbers were most accurately recalled by the children with a linear number line, but small numbers were recalled equally well by children with both kinds of number lines.
It was also found that the children’s ability to count and identify numbers did not affect their ability to recall numbers.
Overall, children who have a linear representation of numbers are able to remember numbers better than children who have a logarithmic representation. This is most likely because large numbers, when represented logarithmically, are less discernible, while a linear representation has all numbers equally spaced apart regardless of how large or small they are.
The authors noted that their findings needed closer examination; despite the fact children might remember small numbers more easily because they’ve been exposed to them more, it does not explain the relationship between the children’s number lines and their ability to recall small or large numbers.
“The kids who used the linear representation are only a little bit better at remembering the small numbers than kids who use the logarithmic representation, but they are much better at remembering the large numbers,” Siegler explained.
The results of this research can be used to help children with numbers and mathematics at an early age by emphasizing the importance of the size of numbers, helping to develop a more accurate number line.
Siegler suggests various ways of communicating this information to benefit children. “We’ve done experiments that provide quite strong evidence that teaching kids through playing a numerical board game how to think about numerical magnitudes helps them in a lot of different ways — it improves their ability to compare the sizes of the numbers, helps them recognize which number they’re dealing with, and it helps them learn novel arithmetic problems,” he said.

The Mellon College of Science hosted speaker Art Benjamin, who gave a talk last Monday titled “The Art of Mental Calculation” that explored the mechanics behind complex mental math techniques.
Benjamin is an alumnus of the Carnegie Mellon math department class of 1983, and he currently works as a math professor and guest speaker. His talks have been featured on The Today Show, National Public Radio, and TED. The TED talk he gave in 2005 has over 200,000 hits on YouTube.
In a mix of showmanship and mathematical prowess, Benjamin began the presentation by returning to his roots as an amateur magician. He called up a volunteer to participate in a card trick, and he afterward invited several students with their calculators to challenge him in mental calculations. The audience, consisting of primarily MCS students across all fields of study, called out random digits that became two numbers that would be multiplied together. Within five seconds, every time, Benjamin provided the correct answer.
Taking questions from the audience, Benjamin delved into his mental math techniques. Using pi as an example, he demonstrated a simple mnemonic device in which one could memorize digits. He assigned each of the 10 digits from zero to nine a consonant (or, in some cases, several different consonants). Zero, for example, became the “z” or “s” sound. He then was able to formulate different words using the sequence of pi. For example, the string of digits assigned the letters “MTTR” could be formed into the word “matter.” Using this method, Benjamin could memorize the first 100 digits of pi in a few sentences.
Some of the methods followed a more traditional form of math. Benjamin revealed his ability to square three- or four-digit numbers. By finding a number that is a multiple of 10 close to the value in question, Benjamin could use a combination of addition, multiplication, and finding the squares of smaller numbers to calculate the answer. None of the calculations took him more than about a minute to explain and demonstrate.
Though he was covering a very complicated topic, Benjamin successfully kept the speech from becoming too dry. When discussing pi, for example, he recalled his time as a writer of the musicals put on by the Scotch’n’Soda theater group. He even composed a song for pi, put to the tune of Don McLean’s “American Pie,” and happily gave the audience a demonstration. During the question and answer session, he willingly answered questions about his personal life. He divulged his favorite number, along with his preference for Macs versus PCs.
Benjamin combined all of his math techniques together in the finale, where he squared a five-digit number. Although he warned the audience that a few digits might be inaccurate, he successfully computed the answer amid a whirl of numbers and nonsensical words — and all mentally. The audience was impressed enough to give him a standing ovation.

The Centers for Disease Control report that, in 2006, 16 million adults in the United States were diagnosed with some form of heart disease. Although heart disease is a major problem in this country, it can be prevented by simple changes in one’s eating habits and general lifestyle. One such lifestyle change that is rapidly gaining popularity is avoiding foods containing large amounts of trans fats.
According to the Mayo Clinic, foods such as margarine, crackers, some types of cookies, and shortenings contain substances called trans fats, which significantly increase the risk of heart disease. Trans fats are produced by hydrogenating other oils. In this process, hydrogen is added to liquid oils, converting them into solid fatty substances. In general, trans fats act as a preservative and enhance the flavor of food. According to the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) website, starting January 2006, all nutrient labels were required to state the quantity of trans fats in the food product. The FDA’s reasoning behind this move was that consumers would now be able to pick and choose their foods carefully and avoid foods with large amounts of trans fats.
The most important factor that makes trans fats so unhealthy is that they increase the body’s levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and decrease levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Both LDL and HDL are carriers of cholesterol, but while high HDL levels can be healthy, high LDL levels increase the chances of heart disease.
Cholesterol is a fatty substance found in the body that has a number of uses — it is an integral component of the cell membrane and a precursor for making vitamin D and some hormones. However, despite of its beneficial properties, excess cholesterol in the bloodstream can be harmful. It is often deposited on the walls of blood vessels, making them narrow and brittle. This causes a condition known as atherosclerosis. It is difficult for blood to pass through such narrow vessels, and as a result, organs of the body might receive less blood and less oxygen, leading to a variety of problems. The clogging of the coronary arteries in this way can lead to a heart attack.
As explained on www.heart.org, cholesterol is not soluble in the blood and has to be transported across the bloodstream through specialized packages called lipoproteins. As described earlier, the lipoproteins can be of two types: LDL and HDL. While LDL tends to carry cholesterol throughout the bloodstream to different parts of the body, HDL carries excess cholesterol to the liver, from where it can be properly passed out of the body. Thus, high LDL levels indicate a large amount of cholesterol in the bloodstream that causes plaques and atherosclerosis. By increasing LDL levels in the body, trans fats increase the chances of artherosclerosis and, eventually, heart disease. Although the major side effect of trans fats is the increase in LDL levels, trans fats also have a number of other side effects. For example, trans fats can also increase the amount of triglycerides, another type of fat that can contribute to atherosclerosis. According to the Mayo Clinic, trans fats may also damage the layer of cells that line the blood vessels, causing inflammation. Such inflammation can also play a role in the hardening and narrowing of blood vessels.
Since knowledge regarding the ill effects of trans fats has increased, fewer foods contain large amounts of trans fats. The FDA’s 2006 policies that require trans fats to be listed in nutrient labels have also helped increase awareness regarding the kinds of foods that still have trans fats. Along with avoiding foods that contain trans fats, people should also avoid foods with large amounts of saturated fats, such as coconut oil and palm oil. Like trans fats, saturated oils increase the LDL levels in the body. In addition to decreasing the consumption of trans fats, consumers are encouraged to replace oils high in saturated and trans fats with healthier oils, like olive and canola oils.

Stars have been an object of human wonder ever since the beginning of civilization, spurring the creation of monolithic monuments to track their movements and countless mythologies to explain their existence. But what exactly are stars, and how do they form?
Stars, commonly thought of as bright, hot celestial bodies, are composed of plasma, the fourth state of matter. The three more familiar states of matter are solids, liquids, and gases. Plasma is the most common state of matter in our universe.
Any gas is made of individual atoms. Atoms are composed of a positively charged nucleus and negatively charged electrons surrounding the nucleus. According to www.jlab.org, plasma is an ionized gas, which means it has enough energy to separate the electrons from their nucleus. Our sun, for example, is a star composed mainly of ionized hydrogen and helium.
A star’s life can be represented as a timeline, with changes occurring to a star over a period of time. Stars are born from molecular clouds, which are giant accumulations of molecules, usually hydrogen, in space. These are also known as interstellar clouds or nebulae. According to an article on www.universetoday.com, these clouds can collapse if they are disturbed by a collision with another cloud, or because of changes in pressure such as the shockwave from a supernova.
After collapsing, the molecules in the cloud start to move inward because of gravitational attraction between all of the particles in the cloud. This also generates a large amount of heat within the cloud. Over time, the cloud will condense into a flattened, rotating disc, and heat will continue to increase. This process may take around 1 million years, and the continual rotation will result in the formation of a core known as a protostar, according to www.howstuffworks.com. The cloud’s original material will continue to be pulled inward toward the core, gradually increasing its mass.
When certain conditions are met, including the core reaching a temperature of around 7 million Kelvin, the elements of the cloud will begin to fuse. In the case of the sun, hydrogen atoms are fusing with other hydrogen atoms to create helium atoms. This releases energy from the star. Over time, this outward energy will balance the gravitational energy of the star that is pulling the cloud’s material inward, forming a sphere. The equilibrium that is established will continue to exist until the star has used up its resources and can no longer release energy. This will not happen for another few billion years with our sun.
What happens to the star next depends on its original size. A star that has a similar size to our sun will eventually collapse under its own gravity, since there is no more outward energy being created. This inward force will cause the core of the star to increase in temperature, and the outer layers will also become hotter, causing them to expand. This will form what is known as a red giant. In time, the sun will become a red giant; its outermost layer will extend past the Earth’s orbit.
Fusion in a red giant will continue to occur, but this time with the products formed from previous fusion events in the star. Usually, a young star will first fuse hydrogen to create helium. When it becomes a red giant, it will use the helium to create an even heavier atom, carbon. However, fuel for this fusion will also eventually run out, and the outer layers of the star will be ejected into space, forming a new nebula. The core of the star will begin to cool, forming a white dwarf. Once the white dwarf has cooled enough that it no longer emits light, it will be known as a black dwarf.
Stars larger than our sun will follow a similar path, but the sheer mass of the star will allow the creation of atoms heavier than carbon, forming an iron core. However, this core is not stable under its own gravity, and it will eventually compress into a much smaller core with about a six-mile radius. This generates billions of degrees of heat, and the core will explode outward in a brilliant supernova. Remnants of the core may become black holes or neutron stars, both of which are incredibly dense objects.
With pressure created by the supernova that can cause molecular clouds to form new stars, the circle of life of a star is complete.

Atmosphere determines flu viability
High humidity and temperatures can decrease the amount of time that flu virus pathogens are infectious, according to a study by the Environmental Protection Agency. At low temperatures (below room temperature) and humidity from 15 to 46 percent, avian flu viruses remained infectious for two weeks on many common surfaces like glass, metal, and soil. In contrast, the virus lasted only a day in contrasting high conditions. High humidity is defined as consisting of 90 percent saturation or greater. Exposure to UV rays can also decrease the period of infectiousness, though it can be difficult for sunlight to reach viruses in crevices or soil. Another study simulated the effects of having a humidifier in the room: Virus counts decreased by 20 to 30 percent.
A possible health issue from overuse of humidifiers is mold growth, due to the moist conditions. However, according to one of the researchers, killing viruses with high humidity outweighs that risk. For an infectious outbreak to sustain itself, each ill person must affect more than one other person. Decreasing virus presence by just 20 percent could bring the infection rate to less than one per person, which would stem any outbreak.

Carnivorous dinosaur reconstructed
Archaeologists in Las Hoyas, Spain, have constructed the skeleton of a humpbacked, carnivorous dinosaur. The specimen, named Concavenator corcovatus, belongs to the theropod suborder, whose most famous member is the Tyrannosaurus rex. Characteristics common to theropods are three-toed feet, air-filled bones, and, in some cases, the presence of feathers. The most remarkable aspect of the new fossil is its hump, a physical feature never before seen in a dinosaur.
Scientists theorize that the hump resembled a cow’s and that Concavenator could have been winged. The fossil had bony protuberances on its limbs that could have been feathers. The nature of the dinosaur’s hump has not been determined yet, though it could have been composed of fleshy tissue or fat, and it might have served only as ornamentation. The fossil was unearthed in 2003, but full construction of the skeleton and its analysis were only recently completed. It is now on display at the Museum of Science in Castilla-La Mancha, Spain.

New quantum theory model developed
Physicists have begun using mathematical models of black holes derived from string theory and applying them to systems in quantum entanglement, using them to predict experimental results. String theory seeks to describe all physical phenomena using a few simple models, creating a “unified theory of everything.” The hypothesis is that all matter consists of vibrating strings, whose vibration frequencies determine physical properties like mass and charge.
Quantum entanglement occurs when two or more objects or quantum systems (qubits, short for quantum bits) become irrevocably linked with each other. When two qubits become entangled, a change in the state of one will cause the other to change instantaneously. For example, two electrons in one orbital can have opposite spins. When separated, if one of the electron reverses its spin, the other will suddenly flip its spin also, no matter how far apart the electrons are. Hence, the information is transferred instantaneously.
The recent development in physics involves using the mathematical models for “stringy black holes” in applications to entangled systems. The results of these predictions can be seen through experimentation, whereas all other predictions of string theory so far cannot be lab-tested because they involve observation of higher dimensions.

Do you ever feel that each time you re-visit a city, it has a new charm — a new look or a completely different feel? You get the feeling that something has changed. You keep asking yourself, “Why doesn’t this feel or look exactly like the last time I came here?” Well, as cities keep developing, something has to constantly change. But despite those changes, our beloved city of Pittsburgh countinues to welcome its visitors with a warm heart. This city, a muse of sorts, has been the guiding light to many people, famous and ordinary.
When thinking of Pittsburgh as an inspiring city, the first instinct of many people would be to ask, “Are we talking about the same Pittsburgh, the location of Carnegie Mellon?” It may be possible to name a place or two in Pittsburgh that is inspiring, but many newcomers feel  that the city doesn’t get much better than that. As it turns out, this first instinct is less correct than you’d think.
Before exploring the places in Pittsburgh that are inspirational today, one should know a few things about the city in the past and how it has has always been strongly influential. We can start by looking at the time in history when Pittsburgh was a steel city, colored in somber tones and factory fumes. At this time, Andrew Carnegie realized the potential of the city and what it had to offer. He built an institution in 1896 that was dedicated to discoveries in the arts. Today, over 300 works of art are on display at the Carnegie Museum of Art. These include famous works such as Winslow Homer’s The Wreck and James A. McNeil’s Whistler’s Arrangement in Black.
Pittsburgh is a city of history — a history that has not and will not lose its importance over the years. While this city thrives on the arts, it is also a city of advancements; after all, Carnegie Mellon and UPMC are situated here.
Pittsburgh is a city full of outstanding geographical locations we often forget to appreciate, but they never fail to inspire young and old minds across the world, even today. Without sounding too cliché, the city seems like the most beautiful painting on a calm day — rivers, hills, valleys, bridges, tunnels, and tall buildings —  it is one of the most magnificent skylines that still maintains an aged feel.
There are two inclines — Monongahela and Duquesne. The Monongahela Incline is a popular tourist spot, but if you want to reach the heart of Pittsburgh and let it be your muse, travel up the Duquesne Incline. It features one of the best and most breathtaking views — truly a picturesque spot.
Several photographers, musicians, filmmakers, and painters have been inspired by Pittsburgh in the past. This is probably why the city was ranked No. 3 among mid-sized cities by AmericanStyle magazine as a top art destination. Pittsburgh is not only home to creative venues like the Phipps Conservatory and the Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History, but also the Andy Warhol Museum. Other unique inspirational spots include the Nationality Rooms of the Cathedral of Learning and the crazed yet thrilling Mattress Factory art museum. The cultural district of Pittsburgh is located downtown and is considered a hub for musical inspiration. Pittsburgh is home to five theaters, and the city even has a cabaret. A city with such a rich history and intense art and culture presence is undeniably inspiring.
The architecture and structure of Pittsburgh can also be inspirational. Being a beautiful mid-sized, hilly city at the confluence of two rivers makes the city a great place for architectural exploration. Pittsburgh also has more bridges than any other city in the world. Have you ever noticed that some of the bridges in the city are golden yellow? This is because the city’s colors are black and gold.
Another outstanding source of inspiration to several artists is the Fallingwater house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, located just outside of Pittsburgh. As Spanish artist Felix de la Concha said, “It is one of the most photographed buildings in the world — it’s an icon.” Fallingwater is special because of the harmonious compositions of the landscape, which are very important to the mysterious nature of the building itself. There have been several artists who have made magnificent pieces of work on this beautiful structure: Kitty Spangler’s painterly “Bear Run Rocks”; Bill Zarvis’ untitled whimsical glass, wood, and stone sculpture; Adrienne Heinrich’s “Art Lives,” formed of moss, copper, and soil; Tiffany Whitfield’s macro-photograph of “Just Another Plant on the Wall”; and Ruthanne Bauerie’s altered photograph “From the Path.” The art speaks to us, bringing out different details.
Another famous artist is Akiko Kotani, who is popularly known for her work on organza (using silk markings) and dark upon light. Kotani has done a beautiful piece of work on the relationship of positive and negative spaces of Fallingwater. David Sparks’ photograph, “Reflecting Pool,” and Benjamin Thomas’ painting “Guest Pool Reflections,” are both inspired by the house and the guest pool. Wright’s design elements inspired Jay Ressler’s staircase photograph “Cantilevered Shadows.” Cynthia Cooley’s paintings “Spring Green” and “Spring Shadows,” one of which is shown in the house, suggest the location’s integration into the environment.
Pittsburgh does not only inspire works of art and creativity but is also home to famous sports teams like the Steelers, Pirates, and Penguins. These teams are historically strong and have become extremely influential in the sporting world. The Steelers have won six Super Bowl championships, and the Penguins were winners of the 2009 Stanley Cup. At any time, Pittsburgh residents can take a trip down to Heinz Field for some sporting inspiration.
Furthermore, Pittsburgh is home to state-of-the-art research and development. Not only are the incredible resources of Carnegie Mellon’s technology and computer science departments located in this city, but it is also home to one of the country’s best children’s hospitals. Discoveries in the field of medicine in Pittsburgh have been truly far-reaching.
We can see that works in all fields — medicine, the arts, sports, music, and more — have been inspired by Pittsburgh. The places listed above are suggestions of places that have truly moved people, famous and not, over time in this city. However, there is no fixed list of places which can serve to be your muse; you can find inspiration whereever and whenever you want. Pittsburgh has been the guiding light to many people, and it may become yours as well.

On Sept. 30, the 1920s comedy The Royal Family will open at the O’Reilly Theater downtown, and it will include two members of Carnegie Mellon’s own family in the cast. Lindsay Kyler and Evan Alex Cole, both of whom graduated from the School of Drama in 2008, will take the stage as Gwen Cavendish, a member of the famous family of actors, and Perry Stewart, Gwen’s fiancé, respectively. Between sushi trips and new plays, both actors talked about the play, the significance of the Cavendishes, and their experiences as actors.  
Kyler’s interest in acting was sparked early in life when her fourth-grade class performed a rendition of Rumpelstiltskin. Soon after, Kyler started to take acting classes, and she eventually attended a performing arts middle school. While at Carnegie Mellon, she starred in several independent films in addition to her theater roles.
Kyler moved to Queens, N.Y. after she graduated, but now lives in New York City’s Upper West Side, and has appeared in plays such as Anne and Emmett, the world premiere of Legacy of Light, and Le Grand Meaulnes. She met Ted Pappas, the director of The Royal Family, when she played the role of Hermia in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, which Pappas directed for the Pittsburgh Public Theater last December. When Pappas offered her the opportunity to return to Pittsburgh to work on The Royal Family, Kyler jumped at the chance.  
Kyler spoke highly of her fellow actors and their influence on her experience in the play. “The cast is wonderful.  Alex Cole and I are the youngest people in the cast, and it’s so rewarding to learn by working with such wonderful people we are sharing the stage with, people who are so much more seasoned than we are,” she said. Last Wednesday, the cast spent the day blocking the play. “We did a table read for two days, and now we are doing blocking direction. Starting next Friday, we go into the theater space and start doing a technical rehearsal,” she said. Kyler matter-of-factly described her busy schedule. “We’ve been going from 10 to 6, usually with an hour lunch break.”
Kyler could instantly pick her favorite part of her experience at Carnegie Mellon. “Definitely the sense of community we had at Purnell — we spent all of our time there. The creative community there is such a collaborative environment. It was a very supportive network of friends and teachers,” she said.
Cole’s interest in acting began when he played Shakespeare in his middle school’s performance of Dogg’s Hamlet. After being discovered in a restaurant in his hometown of Marietta, Ga., he flew to Los Angeles to shoot the 2004 movie Back When We Were Grownups, starring Faye Dunaway and Blythe Danner. “That whole experience was great,” he said, referencing his time shooting for the movie, “but it made me realize that, in order to really do this, I was going to need actual training.”  Cole returned to the East Coast to attend Pre-College at Carnegie Mellon before being accepted to the School of Drama. He now lives in Queens, where he has been working in both film and television as well as stage performance, appearing in Adventureland and She’s Out of My League. He is also a musician and recently released a single on iTunes about his experience on the show As the World Turns, appropriately called “World Turns.” 
When asked how he got involved with The Royal Family, Cole went all the way back to his time in Pre-College. “I met Ted Pappas for the first time when I saw a play down at the Pittsburgh Public about six years ago,” he said. “I never thought I’d get asked to work here — it was one of those pinnacle experiences.”
“A month and a half ago I got a call from Ted, and he said, ‘What’s up, what’s going on,’ and at the end of the conversation, he was like: ‘You wanna come down and do a play with us?’” Cole said, “And I was like, ‘Duh!’” 
Both Kyler and Cole rejected the description of The Royal Family as a parody. The play centers on the Cavendishes, a family of actors who are said to be caricatures of the famous Barrymore family. Helena Ruoti stars as the glamorous actress Julie Cavendish, and David Whalen as her equally celebrated brother, Tony. Kyler plays Julie’s daughter, Gwen, who is conflicted between following in her famous mother’s footsteps as an actress and pursuing a life away from the stage with her stockbroker fiancé, Perry Stewart, who is played by Cole.
“It’s just a glimpse into a family of actors, not a parody,” Cole argued. “It’s just a backstage view of what this family of incredibly successful actors is like. I’m a stockbroker, Lindsay’s suitor, so I’m an outsider, contrasting the larger-than-life-ness of the Cavendishes. These are characters who want to have as normal an experience as possible, but can’t live without the stage. I’ve experienced this myself — it really has a lot of relevance for Pittsburgh audiences who’ve seen Helena Ruoti and David Whalen and know them as daily faces around Pittsburgh.”
Kyler agreed. “It’s a family drama,” she said. “The way Ted has it, it’s more character-driven than plot-driven. It’s all about these characters and their individual journeys, and how they affect one another — the matriarchs Fanny and Julie, and daughter Gwen, and how their relationship is affected by the future legacy of the family name. Will the young daughter follow in the footsteps of her family, or is she looking for something different?”  
“It’s very voyeuristic, because the audience is watching actors in their own home,” she continued. “Usually they see these people in their element, putting up this front. All of a sudden you’re seeing a family of actors not acting, getting inside the mindset of who they are as people and artists, so it’s not a parody at all, but a very humanistic play.”  
Both also had advice for students currently studying acting at Carnegie Mellon. “I had a very type-A personality in school,” Kyler confessed. “Don’t be afraid to fail. Take advantage of the safety net you have at school — you have people there to guide you. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes, take a leap of faith.  If you want to try it, do it now.”
“Take advantage of Pittsburgh!” Cole said, listing the number of theater venues available in the ’Burgh. “There’s the Public, City Theater, and, because of Pennsylvania’s tax incentive, there are loads of movies filmed here every year. Students should take advantage of the fact that Pittsburgh is a thriving arts town, and go get experience at professional auditions as soon as possible.”
Spend an evening at the O’Reilly for the chance to see a couple of Carnegie Mellon alumni living their dreams on stage, and for a unique play about the bonds between family and the passion inherent in all those involved in the performing arts.
Tickets are available for purchase now for *The Royal Family. The show runs from Sept. 30 through Oct. 31.*

The average Carnegie Mellon student has probably never heard of the Milkshake Factory, but for over 30 years the Milkshake Factory has been located on East Carson Street in the South Side, enticing customers with its 1930s chic décor and sweet aromas.
From the outside, the store has an antique storefront with a red and tan striped awning. Inside is a wall of chocolates, candies, and ice cream, elegantly displayed and waiting to be consumed.
Edward Marc Chocolatier supplies the store with high-quality chocolate — with no trans fat — in a large variety of flavors and nutty or fruity combinations. Underneath the chocolate display are shelves of candy, with the ice cream bars not too far away — all reminiscent of a mom-and-pop shop.
Customers can choose between over 50 milkshakes while they browse the beautiful and intricate chocolate displays. There are bouquets of chocolate flowers, candied apples, chocolates in the shapes of leaves, hearts, and even a beautiful, chocolate-molded scene of Pittsburgh. 
The milkshakes — made with milk, ice cream, and your choice of syrup — are served old fashioned: in a malt glass with the leftover shake in a silver canister. Take a seat at one of the stylish marble tables and sip your treat as you decide how many boxes of candy to take home or which chocolate you should try next.
Think this experience is a pricey one? Wrong. On Wednesdays, the Milkshake Factory offers a happy hour where all 55 of their milkshake creations are only $2 and a brick of chocolate is on sale for half off the usual price. The owners are hoping the promotion brings in more customers from Carnegie Mellon.
“Most of the students who come in are from Duquesne or [University of] Pittsburgh,” said Mara Wertz, who works in marketing and operations for the Milkshake Factory but started off over a year ago behind the chocolate counter.
The milkshake menu is a recent addition — recent being within the last 36 years — but just this year a new milkshake flavor was added to the menu: peanut butter and jelly.
“We advertised through Facebook and Twitter and encouraged people to send in submissions for what our new milkshake flavor should be. After narrowing it down, the flavor peanut butter and jelly won,” Wertz said. This customer creation of flavors is not uncommon at the Milkshake Factory. One of the flavors is called “Inspiration,” which means you get to decide whatever combination of ice cream, syrups, and fruit or topping goes into your milkshake.
During the fall, the Milkshake Factory offers a seasonal flavor of ice cream — pumpkin — which is a favorite among the staff. “Whenever we get the pumpkin ice cream I always try to keep it in the store as long as I can. It’s so good,” Wertz said.
“It sounds like such a great store,” said Lexus Beaman, a junior psychology major and resident assistant. “I’ve never been there, but after hearing about it I definitely want to go and take some residents with me. I love chocolate, too.”
With its attractive candy and chocolate display and milkshake bar, the fashionable store makes dessert an experience. A television screen over the chocolate display shows programs from the ’30s, ’40s, and ’50s, such as I Love Lucy episodes or Shirley Temple movies. They also serve tasty hot chocolate — the kind that has real chocolate in it, not just powder and water.
“I think if it were closer to campus, a lot more students from Carnegie Mellon would go visit the Milkshake Factory,” said Dan Chow, a junior design major. “Ever since Dozen [Bake Shop] moved to Craig Street, I’ve seen students eating [their cupcakes] all the time. Now that I know where this place is, I really want to spread the word and get people there. [The] South Side’s a great place to explore for students anyways.”

I didn’t want to take another Spanish grammar class. While I certainly didn’t feel like I was fluent in the language, I wanted to stop reading books, watching movies, and completing grammar workbooks. I wanted to get out and experience real-life Spanish. So I found a volunteer abroad program and decided to become a medicine and health care volunteer in Argentina.  Fortunately, I was able to obtain a Gilman Scholarship, covering some of the costs of the program. During my time there, I worked in a small clinic outside of Córdoba and later at a maternity hospital downtown. Córdoba is located in the heart of Argentina and, with a population of about 1.3 million people, is the country’s second-largest city. It is near the Sierras Chicas mountain range and the Suquía River, about eight hours to the northwest of Argentina’s capital, Buenos Aires. It was awesome to interact with doctors, nurses, and patients in the clinic and hospital, which really gave me a firsthand view of what life as a doctor would be like, and at the same time exploring Argentina.
My top 10 things to see and do in Argentina
1. Go to Buenos Aires. The capital of Argentina is full of historical buildings, an active nightlife, and plenty of sports, outdoor activities, and art. It is an easy bus ride to this huge, interesting city.
2. See a tango show. The tango shows in Argentina are fantastic and really depict a story (if you can understand the Spanish singing). Interestingly, the music is just as important to a tango performance as the actual dancing. The professional, world-famous dancers and musicians at a high-quality tango show, say in Buenos Aires, are definitely worth the few extra pesos.
3. Have a home-cooked asado. This is similar to an American barbeque and is typically eaten on Sundays and special occasions. It usually consists of pork sausage, blood sausage, ribs, other cuts of beef, and chicken, all of which are grilled outside in a brick oven. Typical sides include potato salad, lettuce, and bread. Argentina is known for its meat, and at asados, there is a  lot of this delicious food, cooked to perfection!
4. Watch a fútbol game with the locals. Whether you actually go to a game or just watch it at a local restaurant or bar, the Argentinians’ passion and pride for fútbol is contagious and exhilarating. Who knew a 0–0 game could be so exciting? The World Cup games took place this summer, and whenever Argentina played, it was almost considered a national holiday. If you thought Pittsburgh was crazy after winning the Super Bowl, the whole country rushed into the streets cheering and celebrating when Argentina won its games. The country was blanketed in a cloud of white and light blue.
5. Go to an outdoor market. Enjoy a leisurely stroll through an outdoor market, where you can buy just about anything, including tasty food, cheap souvenirs, antiques, and many types of art by local artists. Whether you are looking for something special for Mom or a funky accessory for yourself, there are lots of trinkets to choose from in the many markets throughout all of Argentina.
6. Drink yerba mate, a traditional Argentinean herbal tea. You drink the mate from a communal mug with a tea leaf strainer built right into the straw. It is very common to get together for mate like getting together for an afternoon coffee in the U.S., but many people also carry around their thermos and mug and enjoy their mate throughout the day. Drink it with a small snack such as bread and dulce de leche — a caramel spread — in the late afternoon, and you will look like a typical Argentinean. It will tide you over until dinner at 10 p.m.!
7. Get acquainted with the Argentinean vos. In Argentina this pronoun for “you” is used instead of tú, and while this makes understanding the language a bit tricky, it is easy to get used to. I learned many Spanish words unique to Argentina and even ended up coming home with an accent. 
8. Meet a gaucho. I used to think gauchos were Argentinean cowboys. They are, but they are nothing like typical American cowboys. Their dress is very European, specifically French and Italian, with berets, loose cotton pants, and neck bandanas or cravats. Today, gauchos are often seen on ranches and in gaucho competitions with horses.
9. Walk from Plaza San Colon to Plaza San Martin. Explore this downtown grid of Córdoba that is full of stores, restaurants, and beautiful old buildings. After getting lost a few times, I learned this area by heart and ended up loving the bustling city atmosphere.
10. Get up close and personal with the mountains and the stars. The landscape of Argentina is gorgeous. For me, being from the Midwest, it was so different to have mountains right in my town and to be able see the Milky Way on a clear night in my backyard. There are many opportunities to go hiking, paragliding, horseback riding, and many other activities to enjoy the Argentinean outdoors. If you are extremely daring, Iguazú Falls, one of South America’s largest waterfalls, is about a day’s bus ride away.
This trip taught me how little I actually know. Sometimes I learned how little vocabulary I actually knew in Spanish, or learned that I really am not familiar with American or European geography. I learned that I know hardly anything about averages in America: salary, car price, school costs, and others. This trip really stretched me to learn more about myself and my culture, while at the same time learning more about another culture, making new friends from other completely different cultures, and learning about medicine. Most importantly, I learned that there is so much out there in the world to learn and explore. I can’t wait to plan my next trip, maybe to a place in Europe or in a different Spanish-speaking country.

The Irish pop rock group The Script is a late bloomer when it comes to mainstream success. The group released its first album just over two years ago in August 2008, but it wasn’t until the summer of 2010 that the musicians got what they had been working toward. Their second single, “The Man Who Can’t Be Moved,” got significant attention over the airwaves, but it was their follow-up, “Breakeven,” that dominated radio stations for quite some time. Now, with the band’s sophomore release, Science and Faith, The Script is back with more to say.
The leadoff track, “You Won’t Feel a Thing,” is a great way to kick-start the album. Though listeners don’t hear words for the first minute of the song, when things get going, the lyrics really take off. An energetic drum beat complements the fast-paced verses, and suddenly we’re in the thick of the music. The next track, “For the First Time,” has a toughness in the verses, and its lyrics serve as a political commentary. “Nothing” is a song of confession. Throughout the song, lead singer Danny O’Donoghue asks, “Am I better off dead? Am I better off a quitter? They say I’m better off now than I ever was with her.” O’Donoghue’s signature voice, a sugar-coated strain, is fragile and captivating. It’s almost as if he could sing the phone book and evoke an emotion within listeners.
Just based on its name alone, the title track would seem like a boring criticism on the endless debate between religion and science, but The Script gives an interesting answer as to which the band prefers: neither. The song talks about how the kind of love they’re feeling is indescribable, as the U2-esque chorus proclaims: “You won’t find faith or hope down a telescope; you won’t find heart and soul in the stars. You can break everything down to chemicals, but you can’t explain a love like ours.” Next on the track lineup is “If You Ever Come Back,” which relies on verses that depart from the expected musicality. Instead, the verses are made up of freestyle, quick-paced spoken lines about how the narrator has lost a lover but still goes on with life as if planning on making a return trip in the near future.
“Dead Man Walking” maintains a typical Script musical score, but becomes a bit experimental when it comes to the vocals. The chorus surprises us with some high notes that sound as if they were sung by Adam Levine of Maroon 5. The lyrics are repeated a lot throughout the tune, so the song feels surprisingly short.
“This=Love” sounds a bit like the boys got caught up in the energy and forgot how to pull back. The verses are pretty calm and vocally monotonous, but during the chorus, everything starts happening. There’s a bunch of cymbal crashes that don’t really fit a rhythm, and the word “love” is said a bit too much in that short amount of time. Then, all of a sudden, there’s an amateur rap tossed in before the song’s final verse.
“Walk Away” is another confession song, but an atypical one. For this tune, O’Donoghue begs his lover to leave rather than stay. It’s a warning to his lady friend: “’Cause I’ll never let you leave, never let you breathe; ’cause if you’re looking for heaven, baby it sure as hell ain’t me.”
Science and Faith caps out at just 10 songs, and the finale, “Exit Wounds,” doesn’t let us down gently, as some albums do. Instead, the band maintains their pop-rock persona, with O’Donoghue baring his soul. The lyrics echo the narrator’s last few moments, and the accompanying music fades out gently as if his breathing slowed to nothing.
Listen up: “You Won’t Feel a Thing,” “Science and Faith,” “Exit Wounds” 
The verdict: With a gently produced sound and a lead singer with a charming and layered voice, The Script returns with a second album that, although not entirely a home run, is far from a sophomore slump.

There is a great difference between cost and worth — designer brand names such as Chanel, Ralph Lauren, Vera Wang, or Marc Jacobs might be worth everything to you; however, the trick is to find these wonderful pieces of art at extremely cheap prices. After all, just because you want to dress well doesn’t mean that you have to pay as well.
Clothes are the ultimate form of expression, from Lady Gaga’s meat dress at the Video Music Awards to Michelle Obama’s latest wardrobe change. Fashion is also a societal convention — you will not get very far in life if you do not look respectable. So yes, fashion and appearances are everything today. However, the economic downturn is also something that must be taken into consideration. As college students, it is often hard to keep up with the latest fashions while remaining within a budget.
Avalon 
This shop in Squirrel Hill is always a great place to start — you can always find some of the latest fashions if you are willing to dig through massive piles of clothing. It is definitely worth investing some time sorting through pile after pile until you find your perfect match: the perfect pair of blue jeans or an olive-green jacket. You can always try them on to see if they look as good as you thought they would. Yet, also keep in mind that Avalon sells second-hand clothing, and therefore you must beware of rips, tears, stains, and missing buttons, so be sure to inspect all clothes before purchasing them. Hygiene is also always important — always wash the clothes that you have purchased from Avalon or any other second-hand store before wearing them, since you never know where they might have been before you purchased them!
Goodwill 
However, for those seasoned Avalon shoppers who are looking for more amazing deals and cheap prices, consider this: Goodwill stores. What are the advantages of Goodwill? There are multiple Goodwill stores in Pittsburgh, so if one store does not suit your clothing cravings, another store just might have those designer clothes that you have been dreaming about. The key to Goodwill shopping is to just go out and try various stores in the areas closest to Carnegie Mellon. It is also possible to procure completely unused pieces of designer clothing from these Goodwill stores — you simply have to be willing to search and search and search.
Thrift stores
If the Goodwill stores do not suit your fancy, there are also other great thrift stores in the Pittsburgh area — Hey Betty at 5890 Ellsworth Ave. is another conveniently close-by thrift store available to Carnegie Mellon students. With hot vintage fashion and collectibles, Hey Betty caters to college students with a taste for vintage clothing.
For those who are wondering if all the time and effort that goes into clothes shopping is worth those designer brand names and stylish clothes, the short answer is that it is up to you to decide. Just remember the difference between cost and worth. If those brand names are worth the time and effort to you, then you should definitely be on the prowl for the best thrift stores and second-hand stores in the area.

From the late 17th century up to the present, our everyday objects have evolved in response to the ongoing struggle to balance beauty and function.
Chairs, for example, take us back to the basics, and in the Past Meets Present: Decorative Arts and Design exhibition in the Carnegie Museum of Art’s Bruce Galleries, it’s all about redefining what we only thought we knew.
The display goes beyond the conventional — beyond the furniture we might find in our dorm rooms or even in our own homes. By opening our eyes to new designs, we can observe chairs that fool us with geometry, intrigue us with shape, comfort us with upholstery, and impress us with strategically carved details.
Upon entry, the visitor can immediately observe Nicolas Petit’s “Fall-Front Desk,” originating from 1780. Don’t roll your eyes: This isn’t just any desk. This impressive piece of work goes beyond the function of being a place to store office supplies; it gives the visitor a visual history lesson. Through intricate patterns and decorations, the facade is a scene portraying the leisurely life within dreamy landscapes of classical and Renaissance architecture. More than anything else, the desk is said to illustrate an important value of the 18th century: antiquity. Once again, we find that art can often take us to places that time simply cannot.
Throughout this series of galleries, portraits and scenic artwork complement the furniture, giving context to various time periods and bringing us back to the fundamental reason of art: to express one’s values.
William Alexander’s “Sideboard” (circa 1840) shows how a static object can imply movement. Through detailing, craftsmanship, and a selection of grain so fluid that it catches the eye, the visitor rediscovers the countless decisions that make up the design process.
Louis Comfort Tiffany, an American designer, captivates the visitor with a subtly different interpretation of mosaic art. His leaded glass window panels, dating back to the early 1900s, prove that cathedrals aren’t the only places we can find this kind of beauty. Here, the pieces display original stained glass windows from a Tudor-style mansion once located at 6500 Fifth Ave. in nearby Shadyside. In explorations typical of the Art Nouveau era, Tiffany experimented with form, color, and light through three corresponding mediums: glass, paint, and light. His work reminds us that sometimes art tells a story better than any textbook could.
On a journey through time, this exhibition guides visitors through various time periods, from neoclassicism and historicism to modernism. It also invokes the realization that these words are not just some artsy jargon; they’re something much more. Encompassing the evolution of design over the past few centuries tells us a story of how we’ve used art to express our values both as individuals and as a society. Architects and artists alike have wondered throughout the ages: “How do I design both physically for the human figure and psychologically for the human mind?” If you want to see what kinds of things they’ve come up with, then Past Meets Present: Decorative Arts and Design gives you the perfect opportunity to do so.
The Past Meets Present: Decorative Arts and Design Exhibition is ongoing in the Ailsa Mellon Bruce Galleries at the Carnegie Museum of Art.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I was walking through Oakland the other day and found myself being taunted by Pitt kids. Some of them yelled out insults at me, and someone even threw an egg at me! What the hell? What can I do to stop their jackassery?
Sincerely, 
Pittjoke
Dear PJ,
Stop being a nerd. The end.
Okay, you probably need to know more than that. You’re a Carnegie Mellon student, so you don’t know how to be cool. You know that nerdy shirt you have? The black one with the white text and the computer pun? Don’t wear that. Might as well be a bullseye. I’m guessing you were talking about math at the time. Stop that. Try to blend in. That means acting drunk, even in the middle of the day.
Pitt kids are jocks, and you’re a geek. You are mortal enemies. 
Just accept this fact. Eventually, you’ll be making a lot of money at some fancy job, and they’ll be your doctor, charging you a ton of money because your company insurance doesn’t cover that life-saving procedure.
**In summary, support Obamacare! **
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
Yom Kippur has come and gone, and my Jewish friends have not given me the apologies I deserve. I demand satisfaction! Tell me how I can force them to atone for all their wrongdoings against me.
Sincerely, 
Jew at Carnegie Mellon
Dear JCM,
Whatever you do, don’t confront them about your feelings. Instead, ask them pointed questions about what they did. Ask if they repented completely for their High Holy Days, and then scoff at whatever answer they give. 
Be incredibly passive-aggressive. Complain about them all the time behind their backs. Hold this grudge tight. Expect them to figure out what they did on their own, and resent them more and more when they don’t. In short, be a woman.
No one knows passive aggressive, hateful actions better than women. I mean, have you seen Mean Girls? After enough tormenting, eventually your friends will crack and apologize for everything they’ve done. Once that’s happened, you can lord your moral superiority over them until the next Yom Kippur.
Women are crazy, 
Brian Hoskins

City of God
Thursday, Sept. 23
7:30 10 12:30
This 2002 Brazilian film depicts the rise of organized crime in Rio de Janeiro between the 1960s and 1980s. Thought by many critics to be one of the top films of the year, City of God received four Academy Award nominations and won 55 awards worldwide. The movie follows the lives of two boys who take drastically different paths while growing up in a violent neighborhood. The timeline jumps around a bit, with the lives of multiple men, innocent and not, featured in relation to the violent environment. Fun fact: On the American version of the DVD cover, the guns being held by the gang were digitally removed.
Get Him to the Greek
Friday, Sept. 24

Russell Brand reprises his role from 2008’s Forgetting Sarah Marshall as Aldous Snow, a well-known rock star who is in the midst of some tough personal times. Consistent hit-maker Judd Apatow acts as producer on this film, which chronicles the attempts of a young talent scout, played by Apatow favorite Jonah Hill, to get Aldous to a famous theater for a performance. The movie features cameos by a wide number of famous pop and rock stars including Christina Aguilera, Pink, and Dee Snider. Fun fact: This is actually a spin-off of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, with numerous references to the film included within.
Raging Bull
Saturday, Sept. 25
7:30 10 12:30
Arguably Robert DeNiro’s greatest acting performance, Raging Bull is a biographical film that explores the life of Jake LaMotta, a middleweight boxer whose inner demons ultimately destroy his personal relationships. Directed by the legendary Martin Scorsese, Raging Bull is currently regarded as a classic piece of American cinema, with DeNiro’s Academy Award-winning performance held in especially high regard. The film’s violent content led to mixed reviews and an average box-office performance when it first came out. Show everyone that Carnegie Mellon is better than the people from the 1980s and go see this classic flick.
Exam
Sunday, Sept. 26
8 10 12
Exam is a British film with a cast you probably won’t recognize at all. You will, however, see that this smart psychological thriller is a prime example of a well-made independent movie. In it, eight candidates are competing for a job at a prestigious company. They are brought into a room and given 80 minutes to answer an unknown question. If they talk to the guard or the host, leave the room, or spoil their sheets of paper, they are rejected. The candidates soon begin to lose it, going to any length in order to ensure they are chosen for the position. Basically, it’s The Apprentice on crack... which actually sounds quite appealing.

Pittsburgh is one weird city when it comes to live music. In early August, I went to Howlers in Bloomfield for a concert. There were two local openers, and the headliner that night was Dead Rabbits, a group from Georgia.
I was expecting nothing more than a regular bar gig. As per usual, I was blindsided. After getting on stage, the two-man Dead Rabbits ripped the carpet out from beneath us and started assaulting the blues mid-show. There was nothing more than a guitar, an amp, and a set of drums, and I’ll let you know that these whippersnappers’ performance would surely have the Black Keys thinking twice about playing the 12-bar blues again. The guitars, lush and with bass distortion, left no need for a bassist. Needless to say that this was a show that you walked out of buzzing with the high of testosterone and grinning like an over-sexed chimpanzee.
Well, what’s the point of my telling you about a show you missed, right? Check it.
Designer Drugs is coming to the Rex Theater this Thursday. You have no excuse not to be there: Tickets are only $10.50, and it’s a 17+ show, meaning even your kid sister can go.
Like with most DJs, with Designer Drugs it’s all about their live show. They’ve been through Pittsburgh two times in the past year and a half, so they must like something about the city, seeing as how most musicians find Pittsburgh to be one hell of a tough crowd. (More on that in a future Paperhouse.) The music, you ask? Electro. Hard electro.
Something that’s consistent throughout most Designer Drugs songs is a spooky “Dracula’s coming to town” synth such as the one found in “ZOMBIES!” Additionally, you can expect a show replete with fat synth bass blasts. Like most contemporary dance, the tempos are within the 128–132 bpm range, so it’s a blistering electro banger show.
I’ll be there. Hopefully you will be, too.

A Carnegie Mellon student picks up a copy of The Tartan and reads his horoscope in Pillbox. Stop me if you’ve heard this one before.
Do something nice for someone today. Close your mouth.
The hot girl you made out with at the party last Friday wants to... Oops. Wrong newspaper.
The world is your stage, and your daily life is a performance. Sadly, I have been hearing bad reviews.
The Ginger’s/Exchange specials set the tone for your days this week. Watch out for Wednesday.
Avoid walking past the Mall as much as possible. You are not giggly and super-happy because you are having a good day; you’re high off the fertilizer fumes.
Walk from the UC to Gates. Take the elevator to the third floor and exit, passing by the CIC. Take the bus to Forbes and Morewood. Once you’re back on the Cut, you will find that you have wasted about 10 minutes of your time. Amazing!
It’s okay; I understand. Facebook made you do it.
You are a leader on campus; it is your job to demand that Monday be mandatory crazy-shirts-only day. The fate of everyone’s happiness is in your hands. Don’t let us down.
When you get dressed in the morning, make sure that you are wearing pants. Leggings don’t count!
Trust yourself a little more this week. You don’t need the bus to splash you with water to let you know it’s been raining.
You have worked hard and deserve a reward. So, this weekend, put your feet up, put on some relaxing music, and clean out your inbox.

Racial targeting in incarceration is an issue that has taken a backseat over the past decade ever since terrorism took the forefront in the court of public opinion. However, it will once again be a hot topic when two new films with opposing views on the infamous trial of Mumia Abu-Jamal debut simultaneously.
Abu-Jamal has been described by The New York Times as “perhaps the best known death row prisoner in the world,” and the question of his innocence and whether his trial and treatment were just has received plenty of international attention over the past three decades. The case is often cited in the debate on whether the death penalty should be used as a means of justice. During his imprisonment, Jamal published several books and commentaries, notably Live from Death Row, which has contributed to his status as a controversial cultural icon.
Professor Johanna Fernandez, who used to teach at Carnegie Mellon as a visiting professor and now teaches at Baruch College, teamed up with filmmaker Kouross Esmaeli to produce a film about the workings of the criminal justice system and, more specifically, the nearly 30-year-old Abu-Jamal case. The film, aptly titled Justice on Trial, follows the sentencing and subsequent appeals of the case while exposing the numerous violations of the standards of fair trial conducted by those involved in the criminal justice system. Filmmaker Tigre Hill produced the other competitor in this controversial film duel. Titled The Barrel of a Gun, Hill’s narrative portrays Abu-Jamal as a cold-blooded cop killer.
“We decided to confront Tigre’s film with a more thoughtful exploration of the case after we saw the series of initial trailers that he released six months ago,” Fernandez said in an interview with PhillyIMC. “Contrary to his claim of having found ‘rare new insight’ into the case, the trailers pointed to a rehashing of the basic arguments put forth by Assistant District Attorney Joe McGill, who wanted to win a death sentence by any means necessary. We want to elevate the dialogue at a time when reasoned voices are needed.”
Justice on Trial challenges Hill’s account of events by reviewing 29 years of judicial records, facts, and historical insight, and the film revealing new and possibly exculpatory evidence. Many consider the crisis of the American judicial system as one of the most pressing civil rights problems of our time, and this film addresses these issues. It challenges its audience to think about the issues of racism and the flaws in the American criminal justice system.
According to a recent press release from media communications company BgConnex, the film “features lawyers and criminal justice experts, young Mumia supporters, citizens across the racial spectrum, and both police officers who defend and those who doubt the official trial records.”
Fernandez revealed that, during its research, the team discovered cases of judicial bias, prosecutorial misconduct, and discrimination in jury selection, as well as police corruption and the tampering of evidence to obtain a conviction. “Some of the violations shocked the conscience. Too many people think that judges are honest and the system is fair,” Fernandez said. “Politicians are doing things to get votes. Criminals are often the politicians and the police are the court system. They are getting away with murder. The other film argues that Mumia killed Faulkner in a pre-meditated fashion, and we thought it would be too damaging to Mumia and decided to finish our film.”
Fernandez also disclosed that her passion for the case and the issue was born here at Carnegie Mellon.
“I arrived at CMU in 1995. I was at a speech by Ellaine Brown. She gave a phenomenal talk. I made a comment, and a professor by the name David Demarest told me that Mumia was not far from Pittsburgh and that I should visit him. His persistence eventually prevailed and I did. I even taught a class at CMU and had a live conversation with Mumia in class. I have been doing it ever since, but nothing will come close to that first conversation with CMU students that we had with Mumia. It stretched us intellectually and it stretched us humanely. My students at CMU had a very strong ethical core. The students realized that the man has been wrongfully demonized by the press in Philadelphia,” Fernandez said.
Addressing students at Carnegie Mellon, Fernandez went on to say that it is “important to keep in mind that students have the luxury of being in an environment that fosters critical thinking. The object of the environment is to ask questions. In this instance, students should scrutinize the case and ask whether justice has been served. Sometimes students do not realize that they have the power to change society.”
Justice on Trial will have two screenings tomorrow. A press preview begins at 2 p.m. at the National Constitution Center. This screening will be followed by “In the Interest of Justice,” a public panel discussion of the constitutional questions central to the controversy surrounding the Abu-Jamal death sentence. Both events are free but public seating is limited. A second screening will take place at the Ritz East Theater at 8 p.m.
Abu-Jamal currently is being held on death row at Waynesburg State Correctional Institute.

The Fine Foundation and Carnegie Mellon have announced a conference, the first of its kind, aimed to study and discuss gigapixel technology in all scientific fields. But what exactly is a gigapixel?
Often, when people watch an LCD or plasma TV, they assume they’re seeing one full picture when, in fact, they are actually seeing the summation of many small ones called pixels. These extremely small units are the increments of a complete image seen on a television, computer screen, digital photograph, and elsewhere. Separate, they look like nothing more than tiny dots, but when they merge together, they have the ability to form clear, pristine images that can greatly increase viewing satisfaction. A general rule of thumb is the more pixels, the better the picture quality. In recent years, the megapixel, one million pixels, has been the unit most common unit of measurement. Now, researchers are pushing further. Gigapixels (units containing one billion pixels) are the new zenith of clear imagery and are also being developed here at Carnegie Mellon.
Gigapixel images are used in many professional arenas: Visual entertainment designers take advantage of gigapixel-size images to capture the essence of life-like environments, while museum curators use them to better analyze classic paintings and other antique works. Medical professionals will be able to gain a better view of the microscopic aspects of the human body, and physicists will be able to conduct experiments on supercomputers with much greater efficiency. However, despite potential utility, research has failed to fully explore the gigapixel. The Fine International Conference on Gigapixel Imaging for Science aims to discuss more on this topic. It will take place on Nov. 11–13, primarily in the University Center and the Gates Hillman Complex. Events will also take place at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History.
The conference will include daily events such as talks, lectures, workshops, and panel discussions. Members of all corners of the scientific community, from geologists and primatologists, to paleontologists and ecologists, will share information and knowledge about the emerging gigapixel field. A keynote lecture will be given by Pete Worden, the director of the NASA Ames Research Center, one of the country’s leaders on satellite missions and the overseer of an $800 million budget in the NASA research department. His lecture will address how gigapixel technology can be used to more effectively educate the public about science. Prominent members of the business community will speak at the conference as well. Keynote lectures from Alan Eustace, senior vice president of engineering at Google, and Mark Bauman, executive vice president of National Geographic Television, will discuss the relevance gigapixels will have in the future of science and innovation.
Carnegie Mellon’s prominent role in organizing this conference regarding innovation is no surprise to many. Golan Levin, an associate professor of art and an organizer of the event, fully believes the university is taking the lead as usual. “Carnegie Mellon’s commitment to interdisciplinary studies takes a lot of forms. What we understand is that technology and culture exist in mutual feedback. By applying our research energies to emerging media, such as gigapixel imaging, we produce dividends in both areas. This conference is one of many outcomes which have sprung from our investment in hybrid disciplines,” said Levin.
Students are also enthusiastic about the upcoming conference and the learning opportunities it will provide to the entire campus community. Students can attend the conference for a reduced price of $100 — a discount of more than half of the general admission price of $250.
“I’m really looking forward to this conference. I think gigapixel imaging is an interesting field and am glad that Carnegie Mellon tries to promote innovation in so many ways,” said Jayanth Muthya, a first-year economics major.
Omer Zach, a first-year computer science major, agreed, highlighting the importance of large-scall imaging as an emerging field. “Gigapixel imaging is the future of digital entertainment. Pretty soon, what we’ll see on TV screens won’t look much different than what we see around us every day. I’m glad CMU is playing a role in this exciting new field,” Zach said.
Those interested in attending the conference are encouraged to register before Oct. 28.

Heather Knight has always been fascinated by robots. As a first-year at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she worked at the Personal Robotics Group and discovered a love for everyday robots with artificial personalities and character. Currently a Ph.D. student in Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute, Knight is interested in making interactive theater productions featuring people and acting robots, in which an audience can teach robots how to be more like humans. Thus, it comes as no surprise that, while the U.S. government is holding a 2010 census, Knight is launching the Carnegie Mellon 2010 Robot Census — the first attempt to count every robot at Carnegie Mellon.
The idea was inspired by recent faculty presentations, typically the way graduate students choose which advisers to work with based on common interests. Knight thought such decisions might be aided by an understanding of what robots were on campus. “It’s like, how can you choose your adviser if you don’t know what robots they have?” she said, laughing.
After sending out hundreds of Robot Census forms, Knight compiled a list of approximately 460 robots (“and counting,” she’s quick to add, because the census is ongoing) with about a hundred different types of robots. The robots span all forms and applications. A few examples: Thomas Gordon, a senior multimedia designer at the Robotics Institute, submitted a form for the Gyrover­ — a single spinning wheel that can traverse rough terrain. There are also artbots, like artist Golan Levin’s interactive eye, and snakebots from associate professor of robotics Howie Choset’s lab, some of which can climb tree trunks. Others, from the Quality of Life Technology Center, could someday help the elderly with mobility or memory problems. And of course, there’s the robot we’re probably most familiar with: Marion “Tank” LeFleur, roboceptionist of Newell-Simon Hall. Professor Manuela Veloso in the computer science department submitted 116 robots to the census — the most so far — and the robots ranged “from small-wheeled soccer robots to companion CoBot robots and NAO humanoids.” The census, despite being in its beginning stages, reveals the diversity of the robot population on campus.
As the days go by, more and more robots are added to the census. What began as a fun project has now become an unprecedented effort. As Matt Mason, professor of computer science and robotics and director of the Robotics Institute, said, “The robot census is fun, but I really might use the results. People do sometimes want to know how many robots we have. It would be nice to have a real answer.”
All students, staff, and faculty at Carnegie Mellon can get involved with carrying out the 2010 Robot Census. Census forms were officially due Sept. 8, but Knight recognizes that the census will require much more data collecting than the initial forms. “I suspect it will require a fair amount of door-to-door footwork to get this finished,” she said in a university press release. Interested volunteers or people who know of robots to add to the census may send information to heatherbot@cmu.edu. Census forms can also be downloaded at www.cmu.edu/news/multimedia/cmurobotcenus01_interactive.pdf.  For more information, please visit the Robot Census Twitter account at twitter.com/robotcensus.

Since 1959, Barbie has assumed over 100 careers, ranging from flight attendant  and peace keeper to lifeguard and surgeon. Later this autumn, however, she will confront an issue more significant than her past concerns of: “will we ever have enough clothes?”
The figurine’s 126th and latest occupation — determined by an open poll by manufacturer Mattel, Inc. — came ahead of anchorwoman, architect, environmentalist, and surgeon by popular vote. With the impetus of a majority of 600,000 cast votes, Barbie will move for the first time into the unfamiliar field of the technical sciences as a computer engineer.
Barbie has customarily been recognized as a character of unlikely proportions and unsubstantial remarks, but Computer Engineering Barbie seems to be a step away from stereotypes that have been previously associated with the famous doll.
“She’s always a secretary. They’re all secretaries,” said Andrew Audibert, a first-year computer science major.
A one-sixth scale figurine, when scaled up Barbie would be roughly 5'10" and 110 pounds with a bust of 36 inches and a waist of 18 inches. 
Her previous occupations have adhered to notions of compartmentalized roles of women. Together, her unrealistic proportions and history of one-dimensional professions have significantly influenced the perceptions of young girls throughout the world regarding what women can and cannot do.
Barbie’s new career realizes the sentiments felt by students, as well as the  the director of Carnegie Mellon’s Information Networking Institute, Dena Tsamitis. 
“There is little awareness that young girls don’t have the opportunity to interact with people in this field very much,” she said. According to her, it is important to show girls that they can do what they want. “There is no limitation to their career path,” she said.
To recognize the significance and ramifications of Computer Engineering Barbie, the organization Women at the INI will be hosting a media event later this month featuring Erin Fitzgerald, an alumna of the program who majored in electrical and computer engineering. Fitzgerald was approached by the National Academy of Engineers as a consultant for the doll’s design, which will carry over characteristics akin to those of past Barbie dolls while incorporating a pink laptop computer, a shirt with binary code spelling out “Barbie,” and other accessories.
Computer Engineering Barbie has all the makings of a watershed moment in the movement to neutralize the antagonistic image of women in the field of engineering. With the transcendence of the dolls in the lives of adolescent girls, the Barbie stands to offer a lasting impact on a young society of girls.
“I love seeing any effort that can help young girls see how a career in engineering is both accessible and exciting. It’s good for the girls, good for the engineering profession, and good for the nation,” said Jon Peha, a professor in the engineering public policy and electrical and computer engineering departments.

Student research explores how doctors rationalize gifts
Although the medical community agrees that accepting gifts from pharmaceutical companies is wrong, a recent study demonstrates that doctors unconsciously rationalize such gifts as a reward for their hard work and sacrifice. Sunita Sah, a Ph.D. student in the Tepper School of Business, and George Loewenstein, the Herbert A. Simon professor of economics and psychology, co-authored the case study to further explain how doctors rationalize industry gifts.
The study consisted of 301 pediatric and family medicine residents who were split into three groups and then asked to complete a survey about the acceptability of different pharmaceutical gifts. Doctors in the first group were primed with questions about their personal sacrifices in obtaining their medical degrees before the survey began. Doctors in the second group were primed with similar questions, and further asked if their sacrifices could ever justify the acceptance of gifts prior to the survey. The final group was a control for the other two groups’ responses. The results of the study were clear: Doctors cued to think about their hard work and sacrifice more than doubled their willingness to accept gifts, while those who were further cued on the justification of such gifts tripled their overall willingness.
These findings will open the door for others to offer a solution to the issue of pharmaceutical bribes.
Conflict Kitchen fundraises for next phase, new culture
Combining food, culture, and politics, Conflict Kitchen promotes awareness and understanding of countries in conflict with America. Every four months of this year-long project, a new country will be showcased. Since May, the project’s incarnation has been an Iranian takeout restaurant, dubbed “Kubideh Kitchen.” 
The traditional kubideh is served in a custom wrapper that contains printed interviews with Iranians on a variety of topics.
However, a new country is due to be highlighted this month. According to a university press release, Carnegie Mellon School of Art professor Jon Rubin, assistant professor of art John Peña, and Waffle Shop assistant Dawn Weleski hope to raise $4,000 by the end of September to fund an Afghan-themed takeout restaurant.
The planned kitchen will be called “Bolani Pazi” and will be the only Afghan restaurant in Pittsburgh. Discussions and daily interactions, like those included in “Kubideh Kitchen,” will promote communication and understanding of international cultures and societies in addition to furthering Pittsburgh’s culinary diversity. A new series of events is planned that will bring together the two cultures in unusual and interesting new ways, according to the official Conflict Kitchen blog.

Since seizing control of the island after his brother “humbly” stepped down a couple of years ago, Raul Castro has vowed to make Cuba’s government-controlled public economy more efficient by opening up opportunities for privatization. The government has been lifting restrictions on the agricultural market so farmers can obtain the tools they need more easily. More of them are being granted tens of thousands of acres of workable farmland in hopes that they will begin producing with a more private, sustainable approach. Just in the last few years, Cubans were allowed to own cell phones and other electronics for the first time. The government has also begun opening up more areas in the private sector, granting licenses to private taxi drivers and allowing small operations like barber shops to form cooperatives.
Now that Raul Castro has announced the cut of 500,000 government employees by March 2011, hundreds of thousands of Cubans who have only known a lifetime of government support are simply supposed to go out and fend for themselves. The road ahead seems long and challenging for the Cubans; hundreds of thousands who have been denied self-reliance for a lifetime are suddenly expected to be fully independent.
Yet Fidel has not left the Cuban stage. Over a relaxed meeting complete with lunch and wine — well-fitted for a comandante like Fidel — The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg asked the dictator whether he still believed the Cuban model was worth exporting as an example for other countries. Castro replied, “The Cuban model doesn’t even work for us anymore.” After 50 years of the longest-standing dictatorship in existence, Cuban society might be taking its first steps in a game of catch-up with the world. Amid all this change, one thing rests assured: Half a century is a lot of catching up to do.
Julia Sweig, a Cuba specialist at the Council of Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C., accompanied Goldberg on the trip and was able to confirm the comment. “[Castro] wasn’t joking and when I heard him saying that, I took him to mean the economic model doesn’t work anymore — not the revolution, not the socialist ethos, not the independence spirit, not, you know, the revolution — just the model,” she said. But Sweig left out the essential detail: that the Cuban economic model, forced on the Cubans for five decades, came precisely from the revolution and socialist ideals.
Shortly after, the notoriously paradoxical comandante seized an opportunity at the University of Havana. In the speech for the introduction of the second volume of his autobiography and discussion of the revolution, titled Strategic Counteroffensive, Castro said he had been misinterpreted by Goldberg and that he had actually stated exactly the opposite: “My idea, as the whole world knows, is that the capitalist system no longer works for the United States or the world,” he said. “How could such a system work for a socialist country like Cuba?”
Cut the chief some slack. “Cuban model” and “capitalism” could very well be the same word. Both have the same number of syllables, as well as four letters in common.
Fidel could have possibly wriggled out of this one as he has done before. He could have excused himself for the misunderstanding by “forgiving” the journalist for misinterpreting the subtle ironies in his — ahem — highly evolved rhetoric, which he actually did try to do in the same speech in which he corrected himself at the University of Havana.
“Jeffrey Goldberg is a great journalist,” he said. “He does not invent phrases; he transfers them and interprets them. I await with interest his extensive article.... I expressed it to him without bitterness or worry. It’s funny to me now how he interpreted it, word for word, and how he consulted with Julia Sweig, who accompanied him and gave a theory,” Castro told those at the university. “The reality is, my answer meant the opposite of what both American journalists interpreted about the Cuban model.”
He concluded by adding that even though he had not actually been misquoted, his words at the time did not capture the meaning, and that what he meant is not what he said.
In Brent C. Kice’s 2008 dissertation at Louisiana State University, “From the Mountains to the Podium: The Rhetoric of Fidel Castro,” he discusses how Castro has learned to master his rhetorical strategy and used it to successfully maintain himself in the spotlight as a seemingly permanent influence.
“Since 1959, Fidel Castro has maintained a prominent position of power within Cuba, whether labeled as Prime Minister or President. Some consider the man a dictator; others, like Nelson Mandela, call him a source of inspiration. Regardless of these descriptions, Castro maintained a rhetorical hold on the Cuban people for his entire tenure.... After removing himself from public sight in 2006 due to illness, Castro allowed his brother, Raul Castro, to become President on February 24, 2008. Despite his withdrawal as the official leader of Cuba, Castro still maintains his image of prominence as the leader of the Communist Party of Cuba and through his column, ‘Reflections of Fidel,’ in the state-run newspaper, Granma.”
By including the Cubans in his narrative of the mission of Cuba within the context of the world and current situation, says Kice, Castro constructed a new identity that situated all those rejected by other classes and allowed them to manifest themselves.
Castro’s choice of words when offering the corrections for his statement on the Cuban model was merely strategic; it separates the idea of capitalism from the Cuban people and their “society” — as if the idea of it were too generic for the particular needs of the Cuban population. This same mentality applies to Julia Sweig’s choice of words when describing what Fidel “actually” meant when he intended to describe the economic model Cuba is aspiring to adopt: a “hybrid model that is evolving”; it could seem capitalist in theory, but never actually capitalist — that’s the gringos’ thing, of course.
The same rhetoric applies to an article that was published on Sept. 17 by Granma that so very poetically describes the university speech for Castro’s autobiography.
“A group of university students were waiting for him almost at the Aula Magna exit and it was their turn for Fidel’s greeting. The Comandante did not disappoint them. He was extremely happy to see them,” the paper said. “He asked them about the conditions of the legendary Aula Magna, talked to them of the atrocities taking place in the world, the massacre of Palestinians, children dying, the holocaust. He admired their enthusiasm and their youth.
“And so he left, with that elation produced by these meetings with friends, brothers and sisters, with the good Cubans of always, with those of today,” the article concluded in its last paragraph. “Certainly the road has been a long and hard one, but the effort has been worthwhile.”
Despite Castro’s contradictory statements, his words suggest the Cuban society’s economic engine might finally be starting to warm up. Yet there is an implicit irony in the fact that the Castro brothers are now admitting the failure of the model they have so despotically forced on the Cubans for so long. It begs the question: Will the wakeup call leave Cubans feeling thankful or betrayed? Is it just another act in the show?

France came to a standstill last week as a 24-hour strike shut down schools, offices, and even public transportation throughout the country. Nearly 1.1 million angry French citizens took to the streets. The reason for this discontent was a proposed government plan that would raise the retirement age by two years and change the current pension system. 
Earlier this year, when the French government proposed a ban on face coverings, including the full Islamic veil, there was hardly any internal protest. The only form of protest apparent through news reports was when a small group of veil-wearing French women spoke to reporters about their views. Clearly, living a luxurious old age is more important than freedom of expression. Or at least a significant fraction of the French think so.
To us, the veil ban is a much more important issue than a slight increase in retirement age. The proposed veil ban angered a number of Muslims and non-Muslims across the world. While members of the Persian Gulf countries felt that the French policy regarding veils showed hostility towards Muslims, countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States also opposed the ban for its religious ramifications. Given the large-scale global disapproval of the veil ban, and the fact that France has the largest Muslim population in Western Europe, it is surprising that the French did not consider the ban important enough to protest about it.
Historically, the French have always been quick to raise their voice against unpopular government policies — protests in 1986 prevented the implementation of a university reform, those in 1993 prevented the restructuring of Air France’s staff, and those in 2005 prevented the school system from being reformed. In most previous cases, the opinion of the French people played a significant role in shaping the government’s final decisions. Now, as well, the large-scale French protests will probably cause the French government to reconsider its pension and retirement schemes. Had the French demonstrated against the veil ban, it probably would have had some impact on the final government decision. However, the law banning veils has now been passed in France, thought it still needs to be signed by President Sarkozy.
While the people of a democracy have the right to raise their voices against what they deem unjust, it is equally important for them to choose issues that are pertinent to the welfare of all the country’s people. But in this case, we believe that France has taken “welfare” too literally. France already has one of the lowest retirement ages in the world. Raising this limit from 60 to 62 will hardly destroy France’s history and culture. We wish that Americans were as publicly active as the French are, but not for the same trivial causes.

What’s that? You want to see the code yourself? Absolutely not. It’s a secret.
It sounds naive and ridiculous to us, too. But that is what Austin Heap and his associates at the Censorship Research Center claimed to achieve over the last year. They created a protocol, named Haystack, that would allow dissidents to avoid government tracking and filtering software. They distributed it insecurely (either by flash drive or a shared Gmail account; there are conflicting stories) to testers in Iran. The media loved them — Newsweek covered Heap in depth on Aug. 6. Congress loved them — Senator John McCain (R–Ariz.) met with Heap as well. The Treasury Department authorized Haystack for international distribution. Heap was an American superhero, fighting oppressive regimes around the world.
There was only one problem with this magical technology that would bring Iran and North Korea to their knees. A month after the Newsweek feature, security researchers discovered that it didn’t work. Flaws in Haystack could allow governments to expose and track individual users. Furthermore, Heap lost control of his network. When asked, he was unsure how many users he had or how to protect them. These flaws are not typically qualities one wants in anonymizing software or its authors.
There are several lessons that we can take away from this event, which was an embarrassment for Heap and his associates and a potential crisis for his testers in Iran and elsewhere. The first is that open access to circumvention technologies is essential during testing. Haystack’s source code was not released, so it was not until after it had been deployed that its flaws were discovered. The second is that members of the media and the government have a responsibility to make sure they investigate before celebrating a new magical technology. If these figures lack the technical expertise to test it themselves (which is likely), they should go to a third party with access to the source code for confirmation. In our zeal for freedom, we cannot forget the importance of caution.

It has been known for years that voter turnout in the United States has been disappointing and is decreasing. However, it is hard to know just how bad voter turnout is without a good point of reference. On Saturday, the recently established democratic nation of Afghanistan held elections to determine the new composition of its lower house of parliament, called the Wolesi Jirga, or House of the People. This body consists of 249 members elected directly by the people for terms of five years.
This election was rocked by violence. According to the BBC, the Taliban had warned voters to boycott the polls and “stick to jihad.” The Taliban also threatened that it had “chalked out measures” to “frustrate this American process” and would implement them on election day. Nor were these threats empty. At least 14 people have died during the polling period as of Saturday evening, and more are known to be injured.
Despite the threats from the radical factions still active in Afghanistan, voter turnout was thought Saturday evening to be over 40 percent. Though absolute numbers are not comparable since the United States has a much larger population than Afghanistan, it is still valuable to compare the turnout percentage. The turnout percentage of the last election in the United States was 56.8 percent, according to George Mason University’s United States Election Project. This is the highest it has been since 1968. It is also important to keep in mind that this election was a presidential election. When inspecting elections similar to the Afghan elections — namely U.S. midterm elections for Senate and House seats — the voter turnout in 2006 was an abysmal 37.1 percent. The last time our turnout for elections of this type was higher than Saturday’s Afghan elections was 1970, when 46.6 percent of the voting-age population voted. These statistics are shocking, especially when you note that the 1996 presidential election had a turnout of only 49.1 percent, meaning that less than half of the eligible population voted for the highest office in our country. All of this is in spite of the fact that there has been no systematic oppression of persons attempting to vote since the Jim Crow laws of the early 1900s.
Now, it is valid to note that Afghanistan is a country whose people recently gained the ability to democratically elect leaders. It is less valid, but still noteworthy, to attribute this greater voter turnout to the newness of democratic elections. In order to address this, consider the statistics from the United Kingdom’s previous elections. Since 1945, aggregate voter turnout has never been less than 59.4 percent, a low noted in 2001. In fact, when inspecting turnout by geographical area, the lowest turnout was 56.9 percent in Northern Ireland during the 2010 elections. By contrast, when examining a much smaller period, only 1980–2008, our winner for the most politically apathetic state is Mississippi in 1990 with an appalling turnout of 19.9 percent. The story is similar looking at maximum turnout rates. Wales wins that honor for the UK with a turnout of 84.8 percent in 1950, while Minnesota wins the United States competition with a turnout of 73.9 percent in 2004. In fact, Minnesota also takes second place with 73.1 percent in 2008. Our minimums are much lower, and our maximums are also lower. With Mississippi’s abysmal turnout, one begins to wonder if the population of Mississippi was informed of the elections at all.
The drop in voter turnout in the United States comes at a crucial time, when radical sections of the population are getting increased news coverage and are building momentum toward a major disruption of the national political system. Though our system may not be ideal, the disruption by these radical segments threatens to throw off the balance of American politics. Earlier this month, Tea Party candidate Christine O’Donnell upset Representative Mike Castle, a member of the House of Representatives since 1993 and a former governor of Delaware, for the Republican Party’s Senate nomination. Fortunately for the collective sanity of the United States government, it is widely believed that she will be unable to win in November. However, her ability to win the primary in the state shows that radical groups like the Tea Party can motivate voters to the polls in numbers that threaten incumbent favorites in races they largely expect to win. As long as voter turnout remains so low in midterm and even presidential elections, radical groups can feed off voter apathy and grow in their political power.

This past week, Harrisburg University of Science and Technology declared a week-long ban on social media sites, including Facebook and Twitter. According to a report on National Public Radio (NPR), the provost of the university, Eric Darr, felt strongly that his students needed to consider the ways in which their lives would change if they no longer had access to social networking. “Often there are behaviors, habits, ways we use technology that we may ourselves not even be able to articulate because we’re not aware of them,” Darr told NPR reporters.
Being a college student myself, I am often overwhelmed by the amount of time we spend on these social networking sites. I certainly applaud Darr’s intention of encouraging students to spend less time online. However, I’m skeptical that a university-wide ban is really the most effective means of adjusting Internet consumption habits.
Considering that the administration can only block social networking sites on university-owned computers, a ban only ensures that students are not using social media while on campus. This does nothing for their social media use off campus. Furthermore, Harrisburg University of Science and Technology, similarly to Carnegie Mellon, is a technology-focused school whose students likely have the capabilities to access banned sites regardless of the technology set up by the administration. In fact, in an update published after the story was originally broadcast on NPR, Harrisburg University student Nathaniel Clarke commented, “I know of at least 10 people who have bypassed it and, you can say, hacked into Facebook.”
These issues are relatively minor in comparison to the real question brought up by Harrisburg University’s actions: What sorts of issues do colleges and universities have the right to weigh in on, and with what force? The use of social media sites is an opinion-based issue. And while arguments can be made for social media resulting in falling grades, less meaningful social interactions, or increased narcissism, the choice to use social media is generally one made on the basis of individual preference. My concern with Harrisburg University’s decision is primarily based on the fact that an individual’s choice to use Facebook or Twitter is not directly affecting the university as an institution and has relatively little effect on academic interests. The idea that a university can make a claim that its students should not use a website because of the provost’s own subjective judgment is ridiculous. Students should be able to interact with their peers using whatever means they desire, regardless of the opinions of their administration.

Seeing hundreds of students in formal attire means only one thing on the Carnegie Mellon campus in mid-September — the annual Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC) and Business Opportunities Conference (BOC).
These two conferences have become premier events in the annual process of finding summer employment or, eventually, a full-time job. Their occurrence early in the school year provides a first chance for students to network with representatives from local, national, and even international companies, pass out résumés, and schedule first-round interviews with recruiters long before the job search gets underway at many other universities. In addition to the job fairs themselves, the TOC and BOC bring to campus a wide array of associated technical talks, company mixers, and information sessions that broaden students’ exposure to potential career opportunities.
Those with longer memories of Carnegie Mellon can attest to the notable growth the TOC and BOC have experienced over the years. Recently expanded to a second day, this year’s TOC filled Wiegand Gym last Tuesday and Wednesday with more than 200 company booths, giving students an impressive 14 hours to attend the event. Also in Wiegand, the 2010 BOC welcomed representatives from 36 companies, who met with students all day Thursday. Securing such recruiter participation at large-scale events in the middle of an economic recession speaks to the high profile of these job fairs.
Further, the interest that the professional world has in the TOC and BOC is more than skin-deep. Last week, Carnegie Mellon earned the No. 10 spot on The Wall Street Journal’s list of schools whose graduates were most sought by corporate recruiters. On a list dominated by much larger state schools offering candidate pools five to eight times larger, Carnegie Mellon was singled out for especially strong graduates in computer science (ranked No. 1) and finance (No. 4).
In the current high-competition environment for the top jobs — or any jobs at all — we are fortunate to have such comprehensive job search opportunities right on our own campus. We congratulate the members of the Society of Women Engineers and the TOC and BOC student committees on organizing this year’s sizeable conferences, and we look forward to further successful events in the future.
Editor’s Note: Kristen Severson is a co-chair of the 2010 TOC.
