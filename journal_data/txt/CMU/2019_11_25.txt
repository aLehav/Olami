Carnegie Mellon's football team was doomed by their limited offense as Brevard College ran all over them on Saturday to win 42-28 in the ECAC Scotty Whitelaw Bowl.
Carnegie Mellon was unable to keep up with Brevard's scoring after a helmet-to-helmet hit led to starting quarterback, junior JD Dayhuff, leaving the game in the second quarter. The Brevard player who hit Dayhuff was ejected for a personal foul, but the Carnegie Mellon passing offense finished with just 16 completions out of 39 attempts and was intercepted twice. Dayhuff's backup, senior Matthew O'Hea, played well with two touchdowns to one interception and going 16 out of 34, but it was not enough to make the game competitive. Additionally, Dayhuff went a dreadful zero for five on pass attempts, including one pass intercepted and returned for a touchdown before he left the game.
This contributed to Carnegie Mellon managing just 193 yards of total offense compared to Brevard's 390. Carnegie Mellon could not sustain a passing or rushing attack, as they finished with a net 25 rushing yards gained. The offense of the day was slow, and they could not generate many opportunities to score. Brevard's defense also terrorized Carnegie Mellon with nine sacks to make it even harder on the offense. Even with Brevard getting flagged for nine penalties, Carnegie Mellon could not capitalize and score.
Carnegie Mellon's struggles did not stop at their offense. The Tartan defense struggled to stop Brevard's offense, so they could not set up the offense as usual. The Carnegie Mellon defense was also demoralized after allowing two long touchdown runs of 81 and 46 yards, as well as a passing touchdown in the third quarter. Carnegie Mellon's defense did generate three turnovers, but two of these came in the last five minutes when the game was sealed. Even the special teams struggled as Brevard blocked a punt in the second quarter and returned it for a touchdown.
Carnegie Mellon's struggles in every part of their game made them look outmatched against Brevard. However, the Tartans still improved from last year overall, and had some big wins carried by their stout defense. 
The Tartans now drop to 8-3 after their final game of the season.

This is Penalty Shouts, The Tartan’s sports column inspired by the The New Yorker’s column Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled column will focus on anything and everything funny in the sports world that is deserving of our comedic attention.
Imagine walking around campus on a cold November Saturday. Maybe you’re going to the Cohon University Center to get some homework done, or you’re on your way to Hunt Library or the Gates-Hillman Center for a group project meeting. Say you pass the Cohon University Center and hear some commotion outside. It’s the football field, also known as (but rarely referred to as) Gesling Stadium. A group of students have taken to the field with banners demanding that Carnegie Mellon divest from fossil fuels, that the university must do this to combat climate change.
The football players are along the sidelines, helmets off, confused about whether half-time is over and wondering when the student protestors will leave the field. The small crowd, mostly players’ family members, a couple friends, and some athletes from other sports teams, is also confused about what is going on. Perhaps one dad yells out that he wants football, and for the students to get off the field. Perhaps a mom is explaining to her younger child what the students are protesting about.
The students are ushered off the field, and the football game resumes after a 48-minute delay. Was the protest successful? Well, at a school like Carnegie Mellon, who knows if a majority of the student body will even know this happened.
Now, this is all hypothetical — this did not occur this past Saturday at the Tartans’ final game of the season. It actually did happen at the historical Harvard-Yale football game on Saturday. Students from both Harvard and Yale took to the field at half-time to protest the schools’ continuing investment in fossil fuels and to call the schools to begin divestment. Climate change protests are all well and good, but the real genius of this plan was that it happened at this particular game. The protests invaded the only popular Ivy League football game of the year and "divested" the focus from football.
In the immediate aftermath, the protest seems successful. The Harvard-Yale game is the most prominent football game in the Ivy League and regularly has sold-out crowds wherever it is played (which, this year, was in New Haven). The game was broadcast on cable television and the protest was featured on ESPN. Yale was trending on Twitter, which I guarantee is the only time the school will ever trend for anything related to sports. The response ranged from complete support to conservatives blasting the students for being "elitist fake news nuisances" to a vast majority of people confused as to why an Ivy League football game was showing up on ESPN and their socail media timelines.
I can only imagine what something like this would look like at Carnegie Mellon. We don’t have a storied Harvard-Yale game, and we definitely aren’t ever going to be on television. The closest team we have to a rival is Case Western, but only people like sports writers for the school paper and actual football players know that. And unlike the Ivy League, which is Division I, we’re Division III, with no athletic scholarships and little chances of players making it to the NFL. You would have a better chance of reaching people for a protest at the black chairs on a given weekday than the small number of people who show up to football games on Saturdays.
Carnegie Mellon is a relatively apolitical university — indeed, I’ve had many friends wonder why there isn’t anything going on prominently on campus related to climate change or military investment in research. There have been some protests and political messaging on campus this semester, such as protests against Palantir and ICE in Gates and the China-Hong Kong discourse at the Fence, but overall, this activity is minuscule when compared with any liberal arts school you can think of.
Let’s go back to the opening scene, to a hypothetical protest at a football game at Gesling Stadium. Perhaps the Tartans are playing their biggest rival, Case Western, or maybe it’s Grove City or Geneva. Students on campus might look over to Gesling Stadium to see what’s going on, but will continue walking to their destinations. Such is the nature of a relatively apolitical university student body. If it were me, I’d just laugh at the absurd choice to do it at a Tartan football game.

When Jay-Z first partnered with the NFL in Aug. of this year, the backlash to his association with such a damaged brand (in terms of social justice), was furious, and partially justified. Why would such a venerated mogul and legend of hip hop even think about working with the devil incarnate of sports leagues? What does he expect to achieve and how does he expect to achieve it? With the rather discordant nature that his partnership with the NFL appeared to possess, it seemed that Mr. Carter was living up to the famous lyric he once spat around 14 years ago, “I’m not a businessman, I’m a Business, man!” A partnership with the NFL would make hip hop’s first billionaire much, much richer and amplify his influence to a level that is almost inconceivable. A mere two months ago, Jay-Z seemed like a traitor to the progressive policies that he has espoused, and thus have been expected of him. Jay-Z was a sellout like the rest of them, and I, the plebian fan, had no reason to expect any better of him.
Then this week, news came in that broke the entire ecosystem of the NFL, crashing into the landscape like an extraterrestrial asteroid signaling an extinction event. A name that few people have expected to hear again was uttered, and once it was, the entire league would never be the same again. Kaepernick was back, and boy, nobody was ready for it.
It was shocking that the league seemed interested in him again, but once a workout was announced for Nov. 16, the entire sports media world, and the regular media world for that matter, seemed ecstatic. People were quick to pontificate on what teams were the best fit for him, on what teams refused to even look his way, and on what current quarterbacks should or should not be replaced by him. However, an interesting counter-narrative had begun its development as well, one that if even uttered a couple of months ago would have brought down upon itself universal consternation. According to noted NFL insider Ian Rapaport, “I’m also told that Jay-Z, who is working with the NFL on some social justice initiatives, was involved in this and pushed this idea to some extent.” Thus, the narrative began: “Jay-Z was a hero, he finally got Kaepernick back in the league, he is finally doing what we want him to do.” Jay-Z was playing chess and not checkers, and I was no longer correct to protest his move.
Then, one more wrinkle showed up within the story, and it has left me in an even further state of confusion than where I was before. Kaepernick complained that he had requested a delay in his training camp, but was refused by the NFL. Now, it seems curious why someone who has 11 teams supposedly chomping at the bit to see him practice would want to delay them, but who am I to judge? Who am I to say that this seems to be the NFL putting one more stake within the heart of Kaepernick, claiming to give him an objective workout while banning outside press so that whatever verdicts come out of the entire process are of the volition and control of the NFL, while giving them an out to finally rid themselves of this Kaepernick problem once and for all. Who am I to, once I heard that Jay-Z pressured the NFL to give Kaepernick the workout in the first place as he took a so-called ‘reputational bullet’ once he joined them, question whether or not his motives are pure or impure? Who am I to judge Eric Reid, Kaepernick’s so-called acolyte in the NFL, calling Kaepernick's workout a publicity stunt by the NFL? I am unsure what to think. That is the point. The NFL can pay penance for its sins, Jay-Z could be the league’s Jesus, and I, the sports fan, will go back to church on Sunday to worship.

A study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine showed that any running is correlated to a significantly lower risk of general death. Researchers pooled evidence from relevant published research, conference presentations, and doctoral dissertations via various academic databases. The data focuses particularly on running and jogging to decrease the risk of death from any cause, cardiovascular disease, or cancer. They concluded that if more people took up running, regardless of their speed or stamina, there would likely be substantial improvements in population health and longevity.
The review included data from 14 prior studies totaling 232,149 people, whose health had been tracked for between 5.5 and 35 years. During this interval, 25,951 of the study participants died.
Overall, any amount of running was associated with a 27 percent lower risk of death in general for both sexes. It was also associated with a 30 percent lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 23 percent lower risk of death from cancer.
Even for participants who ran once a week or less for less than 50 minutes per session at below six miles per hour, the activity appeared to be linked with significant health and longevity benefits. This makes running a potentially good option for those whose main obstacle to doing enough exercise is lack of time, suggest the researchers.
Despite the benefits, increasing the amount of jogging surprisingly did not seem to show any further decrease in the risk from any cause. With the paper being observational, the researchers in charge warn that they used a relatively small sample size with variances in their methods, which may have led to inconsistent results.
It remains to be seen how running specifically impacts the risk of death from causes such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, in contrast to any cause. It is also unknown how frequency, duration, and pace are related to the positive effects of running.
Nevertheless, experts agree that any amount of running is better than none. The study concludes, “Increased rates of participation in running, regardless of its dose, would probably lead to substantial improvements in population health and longevity.”

By using innovative computational methods to synthesize missing pixels from low-quality images or videos, computational biologists at Carnegie Mellon University have discovered missing information related to how DNA is organized in a cell.
“Filling in this missing information will make it possible to more readily study the 3D structure of chromosomes and, in particular, subcompartments that may play a crucial role in both disease formation and determining cell functions,” said Associate Professor of Computational Biology Jian Ma in a press release.
In a research paper published on Nov. 7 in the journal Nature Communications, Ma and Kyle Xiong, a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon currently enrolled in a joint Ph.D. program for computational biology with the University of Pittsburgh, explained how they were able to use a unique method involving machine learning on nine different cell lines. Applying their method to these cell lines allowed them to analyze the differences in spatial organization between the subcompartments of these lines. Before this method was developed, researchers could only see subcompartments in one cell type of lymphoblastoid cells, a line known as GM12878. This line has been sequenced extensively, and quite expensively, by researchers who used Hi-C technology, which analyzes spatial interactivity in all genome regions. 
“We now know a lot about the linear composition of DNA in chromosomes, but in the nuclei of human cells, DNA isn’t linear. Chromosomes in the cell nucleus are folded and packaged into 3D shapes. That 3D structure is critical to understanding the cellular functions in development and diseases,” remarked Xiong. 
To Ma, Xiong, and other researchers researching this topic, subcompartments are particularly interesting due to the fact that they are reflections of the spatial segregation of regions of chromosomes that are highly interactive. 
According to Ma, scientists would currently like to learn more about how subcompartments are juxtaposed and how this juxtaposition impacts cell function. Before Ma and Xiong’s discovery, however, researchers were only able to calculate subcompartments’ patterns if their Hi-C datasets were of extremely high coverage. In other words, they could only calculate these patterns if DNA has already been sequenced in an extremely detailed manner. This is only true of GM12878 and is untrue of other cell lines. 
Ma and Xiong utilized a denoising autoencoder — a neural network — to aid in the filling in of gaps found in incomplete Hi-C datasets. This autoencoder is used in computer vision applications to compute what a missing pixel may be through learning what types of pixels are frequently bunched together and guessing what the missing pixel may be based on this information. Xiong decided to use this autoencoder in high-throughput genomics. He used the dataset for GM12878 to train the autoencoder, which eventually allowed it to recognize sequences of DNA pairs arising from differing chromosomes that could be interacting with other DNA pairs in the nucleus of the cell. 
Ma and Xiong have named this computational method SNIPER. It has been successful in the identification of subcompartments in eight cell lines. The Hi-C datasets of these subcompartments were incomplete. For a control, SNIPER was used on the GM12878 data. According to Xiong, the researchers working on this method do not yet know if this tool is able to be used on every other cell type. Xiong and Ma are working on this method even further to allow it to be used under many cellular conditions and in other organisms. 
“We need to understand how subcompartment patterns are involved in the basic functions of cells, as well as how mutations can affect these 3D structures. Thus far, in the few cell lines we’ve been able to study, we see that some subcompartments are consistent across cell types, while others vary,” remarked Ma. “Much remains to be learned.”

Thanks to 21st-century technological developments, astronomy is undergoing a golden age, as astronomers are increasingly able to prove theoretical conjectures. The latest proof of this concept came when the McWilliams Center for Cosmology at Carnegie Mellon's Professor Sergey Koposov discovered a high-velocity star escaping the Milky Way for the first time.
The star, S5-HVS1, was discovered tangentially as a part of the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (S5). S5-HVS1 was originally part of a binary star system that drifted too close to the black hole at our galactic center: Sagittarius A*.
“We know pretty much for sure that it was ejected from the galactic center, which is the first time ever that we have a confident association between a star and the galactic center,” Koposov said in an interview with The Tartan.
The observation of a high-velocity star emanating from a black hole appears to be a proof of concept of Hills Mechanism, stating that when a binary star system is disrupted by a supermassive black hole, one will orbit around the black hole while the other is flung outward at high-velocity: essentially a gravitational trebuchet.
“It’s a three-body mechanism similar to what people use to launch satellites to distant planets. They have gravitational encounters with Jupiter and the sun that cause it to move much faster, like the Voyager Missions [which used Saturn] ... When three bodies interact, you can produce chaotic outcomes where one object is ejected at high speed,” Koposov said.
But S5-HVS1 is only a small part of a huge puzzle when it comes to the gravimetric interactions that occur near a black hole. Of interest to Koposov is an accretion of stars in a disc around Sagittarius A* that is not parallel to the plane of our galaxy. 
“It turns out that around the black hole there are young stars, and we don’t quite know why… It also turns out that some of the stars near the black hole form into a disc rotating in one plane, and we don’t know how that happened. And, surprisingly, [S5-HVS1] is actually flying in a direction that is within that disc of young stars. So, it could be a coincidence, but it could indicate that the process that ejected it is the same that led to the creation of this disc,” Koposov added.
Another mystery that S5-HVS1 may provide a clue toward is dark matter. Scientists have known for some time that the amount of observable matter in the galaxy does not correspond to the gravimetric interactions observed in the outermost regions of the spiral arms of the Milky Way; thus, there must be some extra matter.
“When you have one star and you know it was ejected from one point in the galaxy, if you see that the vector doesn’t quite point to the center, you know the trajectory was deflected by something, and it was likely deflected by the presence of dark matter in the galaxy. With one star, you cannot quite do this measurement, but with more stars, we might be able to model them together and say ‘oh, the Milky Way must have this amount of dark matter and it is distributed in this way,’” Koposov said.
S5-HVS1 is not a particularly old star. It is a blue star, which tends to live much shorter lifespans than yellow or red suns, a bit over twice the size of our sun. “It’s not older than maybe 100 million years old, and it was ejected five million years ago, and the stars in the galactic center are about five million years old which is surprisingly coincidental with the flight time of [S5-HVS1], which is another reason to believe that they are connected,” Koposov said.
Since this is the first observance of a high-velocity star being ejected by a black hole, there is no way to know the frequency of such events. However, Koposov estimates that it may happen to 10s or 100s of stars in each galaxy, so it is quite a rare occurrence considering that galaxies have hundreds of billions of stars.

"Are Dreams Ambrosia"
Are dreams ambrosia or just poison sweet,
Designed to lull the unsuspecting mind
To nothing while time runs blithe and fleet
And leaves the dormant human race behind?
For oft I find my soul in wistful ire
That night holds such dominion o’er my years;
Alas, though I may struggle I still tire
And can do naught but shed those poignant tears.
For why should I surrender every day
To darkness when the moon and stars arise?
And why should I let hours slip away
Whilst I watch on with closed and bittered eyes?
I try to flee the looming storm and still
The shadows inundate my restless will.
"Fire in the Sky"
I raised my head and saw a fire
Burning in the sky
Like sparkling amber sprinkled onto
Golden fields of rye;
It seemed to me a gateway calling
Us to journey through
Into a world so close — so close — to
That of me and you
Except, perhaps, the people there chose
Different paths to take:
Forgiving friends and sparing foes for
Naught but kindness’ sake.
Perhaps we bade goodbye — at last! — to
All that we regret,
And you and I weren’t doomed to wonder
Whom we never met.

Welcome to Maddy's Monthly Meme Madness, where we take a look at the Top 5 most-liked memes on the Facebook group, Carnegie Mellon Memes for Spicy Teens, posted in the past month.
1) "Kosbie humor" by ‎Jose Garcia (10/10)
This would’ve been a solid 9/10 meme... until I saw the “made with sadness” in the bottom-left corner. Instant 10/10 for the play on “made with [meme generator]” trademark we see infiltrating memes that are cheaply mass-produced without any heart or soul.
2) "Sexy Halloween" by Reneé Nikolov (9/10)
Finally, some non-controversial yet hilarious Halloween costumes! The only good part of Halloween 2019’s abysmal weather conditions was that my eyes were protected from witnessing the fabled Sexy Mister Rogers costume.
3) "OG CMU" by Alexander Chen (9/10)
Chen captioned this meme: “i’m gonna tell my kids that this was carnegie mellon university.” The meme format inherently makes a bold assumption that climate change won’t corrupt our children’s future before we can corrupt them with fake news, and this meme specifically makes the bold assumption that we’re a ripoff of MIT.
4) "Press F" by Jose Garcia (9/10)
‘Tis the season for cozy sweaters, holiday drinks, prematurely played Christmas music... and course registration. Deepest condolences to all our fellow memers who are still on the waitlist.
5) "Mental health @ CMU" by ‎Anne He (10/10)
Although He downplayed her own meme by calling it “stolen,” she managed to create a meme that unfortunately too many students relate to. Through this humorous format, she highlights a problem we have on campus: inaccessibility of resources. The Tartan is proud of any student who is struggling and recognizes the strength it takes to continue this conversation.

The holidays are approaching. The temperature is plummeting, Christmas music is prematurely blaring in stores, students are frantically wrapping up the end of the semester ... and the controversial Starbucks cups have come out.
Wait, has there been an uproar over the cups this year?
The last controversy I can remember over Starbucks holiday cups was in 2017, when two women's hands were displayed on the cup. This was clear evidence of Starbucks fanning the flames of the War on Christmas. First, it was "Happy Holidays" printed on cups; next, plain red cups. What's next, keeping the classic white cup design all throughout Christmas? How am I supposed to keep the Christmas spirit without reindeer, which have nothing to do with my faith, grazing my cup?
I've come to accept controversy over disposable coffee cups as a Christmas tradition, much like putting up Christmas trees or making gingerbread houses. But this year, it's been too damn quiet. I don't like this. How can we have the holidays in the 21st century without an uproar over the cups?
Folks, I present to you possibly the greatest idea: the War on the War on Christmas.
Simply having a war is not enough. Seeing radical conservatives getting worked up over secular cups and seeing the secular response is not enough. We're about to welcome a new decade, friends. We must break the fourth wall that corporate America has constructed to see two major consumer demographics fight over. The large corporations hope to gain traction and revenue by having uproar, and what better way than to ruffle some feathers over the War on Christmas?
Yes, you're hearing that right: the War on War on Christmas is fighting the forces that threw us into the war in the first place.
How I will go without my peppermint mocha skillfully made by an underpaid barista is beyond me. I can barely assemble a peanut butter sandwich, never mind assemble a specialty drink. But, hey — this generation is full of young and overzealous souls who think they can overhaul society but are too terrified to order pizza on the phone. Maybe my incompetence will be overridden by a cumulation of anxiety-riddled young adults. Maybe they can converge into at least one functional entity that can lead the war against the war that's been phasing in and out for decades.

Last Sunday, the Pittsburgh Pet Expo brought pet owners and enthusiasts to the David A. Lawrence Convention Center. The gathering, which billed itself as “the largest pet expo on the East Coast,” featured vendors selling exotic reptiles, a dog grooming contest, and other exciting pet-related events.
Sunday’s biggest spectacle by far was the pet costume contest, where pet owners vied for gift baskets and the title of best in their category. As a huge proponent of animals wearing clothing, I was in heaven.
Dogs, cats, a rabbit, and a snake graced my eyes in their perfect combination of uncanny and cute costumes. Standouts included Lilly, a hound mix disguised as a Port Authority Bus, three dogs dressed as crayons in a Crayola box stroller, and Lena, the great-dane-turned-flower-garden.
The star of the show, and winner of the small dogs category, was Girlfriend. The long haired chihuahua was dressed as a spider, with eight fuzzy legs secured on her harness that seemed to move with her.
During the finals round, I abandoned my previous decision to remain neutral and screamed when Girlfriend was called back to the stage. All hail Girlfriend, the chihuahua-spider mix, the canine cryptid of my dreams.

After a long hiatus, Marika’s Menu is back! This week, we’re making a hearty and healthy dish stuffed with fall ingredients: ratatouille!
Most people have heard of this delicious garden dish because of the Pixar film of the same name, but the dish itself only comes up at the end of the film, when Remy makes it for the harsh critic. But have you actually had the dish itself? With many different kinds of vegetables arranged in a beautiful spiral, ratatouille is surprisingly easy to make.
Pro tip: if you can, or if it’s the right season, I highly recommend going to your local farmers' market for your ingredients. Fresh vegetables go a long way to make a dish that much better.
Ingredients
The vegetables
- 1 yellow squash
- 1 zucchini
- 1 eggplant (Chinese eggplant recommended for shape)
- 3 Roma tomatoes
The tomato sauce
- 3 tomatoes (any kind)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 1 bell pepper (red or orange), diced
- 3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 6-8 leaves of basil, chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste
The herb dressing
- 3-4 leaves of basil, chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 4 tbsp olive oil
- Assorted herbs by preference (e.g., thyme, parsley, etc.)
- Salt and pepper to taste
Directions
1) Preheat oven to 375 °F.
2) Thinly slice the yellow squash, zucchini, eggplant, and roma tomatoes into 1/16 inch (1 mm) rounds. Set aside.
3) Cut a shallow “x” at the bottom of the three tomatoes. Steam tomatoes for 3 minutes, or until the skin peels right off. After peeling, dice the tomatoes, making sure to keep all the juices.
4) In an oven-safe pan,* heat the olive oil, dump in the diced onions and bell pepper, and stir fry on high heat for 5 minutes, until the onion begins to grow translucent. Stir continuously to prevent too much browning. Add in the minced garlic, diced tomatoes, and tomato paste and stir for 1-2 minutes until the tomatoes are incorporated with the onion and pepper into a thick sauce. Season with salt and pepper and top with chopped basil.
5) Take your sliced vegetables from step 2 and organize into an alternating pattern (such as a slice of yellow squash, zucchini, eggplant, tomato, and repeat). Carefully arrange in the pan over the tomato sauce, beginning from the edge and making your way to the center. The rounds would be overlapping and layered (see photo).
6) In a bowl, combine chopped basil, minced garlic, olive oil, assorted herbs, and salt and pepper to make the herb dressing. Spoon about half of the dressing liberally over the vegetables.
7) Cover the pan with aluminum foil and put it in the heated oven. Bake for 30 minutes, remove the foil and bake for another 20 minutes.
8) After baking, spoon the rest of the herb seasoning over the dish. Serve warm. Bon Appétit! 
*If you do not have an oven-safe pan, no worries — simply transfer the finished sauce into a round baking dish.

Young adults across college campuses are suffering from chronic loneliness, a hidden and often misunderstood condition. A growing body of research has found loneliness to contribute to premature death, one study suggesting loneliness being eqivilent to smoking smoking 15 cigarettes a day. It impairs people’s cognition, creativity, sleep, mental health, and even their immune systems.
The Life@CMU Project, which concluded this year, found that loneliness rates at Carnegie Mellon were at levels similar to other schools, with students showing consistently high levels of loneliness that remained unchanged throughout the study.
Last month, on an anonymous Facebook confession page a Carnegie Mellon student posted, “I’m an upperclassman. Despite all the time I’ve spent here, I still feel completely alone... My grades are good, I’m on the ‘track’ to a great job, but I’m miserable and I feel that my life and my energy has been sucked up entirely by CMU and by my classes. All I want is to talk with someone, to get close to the few people I find interesting, but somehow I never do.”
Loneliness is an experience and a feeling that can be described as being unseen, unloved, or disconnected. Carnegie Mellon Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) executive director Shane Chaplin described it as “one of the most terrible things that can happen to a human being.”
There are various ways to describe how we think about social connections. Last year, at a forum on the loneliness epidemic, former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy described the ways we can address loneliness as strengthening our connections in three “bins”. The first bin is about connections to the people we know closely and love; the second bin is about connections with the people we interact with in the world such as classmates, coworkers, or strangers; the third bin is about connection with ourselves and our self-worth.
Research David Creswell, Associate Professor of Psychology, published earlier this year, found that among his study’s participants, mindfulness training reduced loneliness and increased social interactions. “When we are practicing mindfulness we can become aware of instances where we feel disconnected or we feel alone … and then to be able to reconnect with, ‘What do I need in this moment’, and, ‘What do I need in this space?,’” says Angela Lusk, Program Director for Wellness Initiatives at Carnegie Mellon.
Lusk hopes that offering students access to services such as the Headspace meditation app will create scaffolding for students to begin utilizing mindfulness, and then offer them deeper ways to connect with campus resources.
When speaking on how CaPS can help students struggling with social connections, Chaplin said, “a lot of the challenges we see in students have to do with interpersonal relationships … when you work with other students in a safe environment, then you’re learning how you appear in front of other people, and you’re able to get that immediate feedback.” CaPS has recently been increasing the number of group workshops and therapy options.
CaPS will also be starting a program called Let’s Talk to go out onto the campus and counsel students in a more accessible way. “We are trying to find different ways to reach out to the community to make ourselves more visible,” Chaplin said.
Student organizations dedicated to supporting mental health are also springing up on campus. Here For You is a new student group that focuses on the lack of mental health support in campus culture by holding discussion meetings on mental health topics, holding campus-wide events, and helping students access support resources. A chapter of Active Minds, a national organization seeking to spread mental health awareness, is also expected to start up at Carnegie Mellon in the spring.
Efforts are happening within specific colleges as well. Dietrich College will begin teaching a course called “Hack Your Life” next year. The Mellon College of Science (MCS) will continue to run their first-year required course, “EUREKA! Discovery and Its Impact.” MCS Associate Dean Maggie Braun explains that the course works “as a way to help students transition to Carnegie Mellon with a big focus of the course on the habits of successful scientists and mathematicians…. We have topics related to wellness and mindfulness … and we talk about sense of belonging.” Braun says that MCS also provides students with wellness courses that they take during their upperclassmen years.
There are also non-curricular differences between colleges. The School of Drama has a mentor program of senior “Bigs” guiding freshmen “Littles.” “My Big is one of my closest confidants here. She’s wonderful, and I think that could be really helpful because it’s like an automatic friend who can guide you through everything … to have a peer who’s been through exactly what you have is a blessing,” said Lucy Hall. a first-year in the School of Drama. The school also has a Wellness Advocates group that Associate Head Dick Block described as “serving as an information resource within the School of Drama and as a liaison between the students and all of those aforementioned [student support] resources.”
The beginning of one’s first year is a key time to form relationships. As Chaplin says, “you have people coming in separating from one of their biggest sources of connection ... those first few days and weeks we know are key for connection; if that fails and you don’t find a home or group to connect with, that is when you begin to risk that chronic isolation.”
Amy Yearwood is the Director of Summer Studies and Strategic Initiatives, and has led the (re)CHARGE Program, which offers first-years and sophomores the opportunity to connect with the Carnegie Mellon community over a summer session. From her experience with students coming to (re)CHARGE, “for the first time in our lives we’re meeting people who come from very different situations from us, and that’s exciting … but it also is a little terrifying and it can be hard to make those initial relationships.”
Yearwood said “a lot of students I met were so involved in high school. Maybe played three varsity sports, they come here as a [first-year], but they didn’t choose to be an athlete so all of a sudden that part of their life that’s been huge since they were five years old is gone … these things have been consuming your life for years and all of a sudden you come here and you’re just a student.”
There’s also a sense that Carnegie Mellon’s work culture might be influencing student loneliness, causing students to opt for transactional relationships over deeper emotional ones. Brandon Bohrer, a computer science student in the Here For You student organization stated that many students have “trained themselves into this regimen of ‘I’m just going to destroy myself until I have all the degrees and then real life is something that starts later and I’ll just punish myself until then’. No, you’re already living real life.”
Some say that the amount of work in students’ lives is hindering them from forming deeper social connections. Former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy described today’s omnipresence of work as keeping us from forming the deeper connections we crave. Creswell said his perception is that “we’re in this achievement culture here — ‘All it should be about is the work’ — and I think we’re needing to find better ways to engage each other.”
The anonymous student who posted on the confession page also seemed to speak to how the Carnegie Mellon work culture affects students’ connections. “A lot of this is my own fault, but much of it isn’t. If I had less busywork, if I was under less pressure to keep up my GPA, if people wanted to talk about things other than classwork and exams, perhaps things would be different. Maybe if I had the courage to just talk to people, things would be different.”

A week before an important contract between Palantir, a California software company, and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is set to end, college communities across the U.S. have come together to protest the company’s relationship with ICE and their university’s relationship with Palantir. At Carnegie Mellon, campus organizers planned a day of action at the beginning of last week to protest the university’s connections to Palantir, whose technologies are in the processes of investigation and detention of undocumented immigrants. The protest comes as part of a national effort against the tech company’s role in immigration enforcement.
Palantir’s contract in question revolves around a system they call FALCON. FALCON is an intelligence system that is part of a larger database system handling the case management for a variety of government organizations. Homeland Security Investigative agents, or HSI’s, have access to the database system, and with the help of the technology, they are able to detain somewhere between 10 and 40 people per week in Pittsburgh alone, according to Casa San Jose, a local organization that participated in the campus action.
Casa San Jose, CAIR (Center for American Islamic Relations), Students for a Democratic Society, and Mijente all had a presence at the protest, which took place outside the Cohon University Center and later moved inside due to the cold. Opening statements were read by Bonnie Fan, a main organizer of the protest and masters student in public policy and data analytics, who introduced the relationship between Palantir and ICE: “FALCON is used in mass workplace raids, including one that took place in Mississippi that took in several hundred workers.” The workplace raid Fan cited took place in early Aug. of this year, where 680 undocumented workers were arrested.
Laura Perkins, the emergency response organizer for Casa San Jose, also spoke at the protest. Day to day, Perkins is responsible for emergency services provided by Casa San Jose to undocumented families affected by ICE, like finding a lawyer or providing family care services if a parent is arrested. Speaking to the crowd gathered outside the Cohon University Center, Perkins referenced the number of people detained each week in Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon’s role in this issue. “This is happening in our backyard, so CMU is a part of that,” Perkins said, “and they [local police] have a database that ICE could access.”
Later, Fan explained how Carnegie Mellon affects the technology pipeline that has fed into the technology used by ICE: “There’s Palantir technology that was originally tested on international communities, which is tech affecting us on a global scale, but it extends all the way down to Carnegie Mellon doing research on predictive policing.”
The protesters point out that Carnegie Mellon has an established relationship with Palantir beyond partaking in an abstract technology pipeline. Carnegie Mellon invited Palantir to campus to give a talk at the beginning of Oct. Palantir has made numerous appearances at job fairs across campus including the Technical Opportunities Conference, Encompass, and the Creative Arts Opportunities Conference. Protesters noted that graduates of Carnegie Mellon go on to work for Palantir, taking their knowledge and research with them.
In response to the protest, Carnegie Mellon spokesman Jason Maderer reaffirmed the free speech rights of students on campus. Maderer wrote in a statement, “We support the rights of students protesting and firmly believe CMU must be a place where ideas are expressed freely, provided that discourse respects the rights of the university community.” 
No comment was provided about Carnegie Mellon’s stance on the contract between ICE and Palantir.

In a campus-wide email on Friday, Nov. 8, President Farnam Jahanian shared recommendations from the more-than-a-year-long inquiry from the Task Force on Campus Climate, which was tasked last year with finding ways to improve inclusion, diversity and equity at Carnegie Mellon.
Jahanian announced the task force in an Aug. 2018 campus-wide email. The task force was to be led by three co-chairs, David Danks, L.L. Thurstone Professor of Philosophy and Psychology and Department Head in Philosophy, Jodi Forlizzi, Professor and Geschke Director of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, and Michelle Piekutowski, associate vice president and chief human resources officer.
This announcement followed the resignation of Lenore and Manuel Blum, professors of computer science at Carnegie Mellon. In a memo explaining her exit, Lenore Blum cited what she saw as “sexist management” and “professional harassment.”
“We are committed to thoroughly investigating those concerns, and to acting upon the findings,” said Jahanian in the announcement of the task force, addressing the Blums’ resignation. He also noted that the task force represented an opportunity for broader investigation into the campus climate, “That inquiry notwithstanding, the senior leadership of the university, including the provost and the deans, recognize that this is an opportunity to check in with our community.”
Danks, Forlizzi, and Piekutowski divided the task force into five subcommittees after hearing what the faculty, students and staff on the task force wanted to address. Figuring out what the subcommittees would examine, said Piekutowski, was “a really nice brainstorming activity.”
Danks was the liaison to the Empowerment and Structures subcommittee, as well as the subcommittee meant to look into issues on the Qatar campus. Forlizzi was the co-chair liaison to the Research and Discovery subcommittee, which was set with discussing the empirical methods to use to identify problems and working solutions. Piekutowski was the liaison to the Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity and the Respect and Relationships subcommittee.
The task force embarked on an over 75-session listening tour. “The nice thing that we did see was so many correlations between, you know, what the task force subcommittee groups were providing, as well as what we were hearing from the listening tours that we went on,” said Piekutowski.
“One piece of feedback that we received a lot was there’s not one area on campus responsible for diversity, inclusion and equity,” said Piekutowski. While attendees reinforced that changes to support diversity and inclusion should happen campus-wide, many recommended the creation of a specific office, like the student-facing Center for Diversity and Inclusion, that would reach out to everyone on campus.
During the tour, said Piekutowski, faculty and staff tended to bring up issues with transparency and clarity in processes on campus. Graduate students often talked about implementing family leave programs, and international students tended to ask for financial support and programs aimed at promoting a sense of belonging.
Jahanian, in the official charge, asked the task force to analyze the “Campus Climate” by identifying what programs are in place to promote diversity, inclusion, and equity on campus, figuring out how best to promote them and recommending new programs. He gave them the same tasks when it came to the “Campus Response,” asking them to identify and recommend new channels to report incidents that violate these specific principles.
Jahanian’s campus-wide email on Friday, Nov. 8 outlined some of the key issues that the task force encountered: “There have been accounts of ‘divisive, hostile, and generally non-inclusive behavior by individuals in positions of structural power,’ most notably affecting staff and graduate students. Furthermore, they found that women and underrepresented minorities also were unduly affected by these incidents and by climate issues across the board.” Jahanian also linked to two reports from the task force, a 53-page outline of recommendations and a five-page summary of findings.
The report outlines five recommendations from the task force, highlighting long- and short-term components for implementation. With these recommendations, says Piekutowski, “the task force work is actually complete,” but the co-chairs will continue to work with the Implementation Steering Committee, which also includes the provost, chief human resources officer, vice president for student affairs and dean of students, and vice president of marketing and communications. The recommendations are targeted at the Steering Committee, but some are also geared towards implementation through the college-level diversity initiatives.
The first recommendation centers on developing programs that promote a sense of belonging for students, faculty, and staff. The report recommends looking at the role of affinity groups and community organizations in promoting belonging, as well as assessing university initiatives supporting policies like accessibility, parental leave, childcare, and gender-neutral restrooms. The task force also recommends creating working groups to examine the experiences of those in the community who have disabilities, and international students.
The second recommendation focused on promoting awareness and understanding of professional ethics and the values of diversity and inclusion through professional development and training programs. Some training would be targeted at supervisors and managers, focusing on things like professional ethics, while other training programs would focus on creating pipelines to leadership positions for underrepresented groups. The task force also recommends the implementation of new channels for reporting violations, as well as establishing advocate programs for diversity and inclusion at different levels of the university.
The task force addressed hiring and retention processes with their third recommendation, asking that the university develop specific plans to hire, retain, and reward underrepresented groups, as well as increase transparency and consistency when it comes to hiring leaders.
The remaining points focus on communication and oversight of programs for diversity and inclusion on campus. The fourth recommendation suggests that a working group develop and maintain a dashboard with different diversity metrics, and the fifth recommendation asks that the university improve communications about the programs that are developed and the reporting tools. The importance of communications to the task force’s recommendations, said Piekutowski, led to the inclusion of the vice president of marketing and communications on the final steering committee.
The task force recommendations represent the end of a process that took more than a year, but the beginning of the process of implementation by the steering committee. In an emailed statement, Piekutowski said, “given all of the feedback that the Task Force on Campus Climate received, CMU has work to do across all campuses and across all community members to improve climate and CMU’s leadership is committed to and focused on making sustainable improvements. Some of these improvements will be immediate and others will take longer. We all have a role in improving climate at CMU. We encourage all members of the campus community to read President Jahanian’s email and the attached task force reports.”

Finals week is looming, and many students are stressing over their last shots at achieving the best possible grades. For students around the country, that might mean aiming to boost their scores by a few points to reach an A- or B+. However, Carnegie Mellon doesn’t offer those options: if you don’t earn an A, you wind up with a B, and if you can’t reach a B, you fall to a C.
In recent decades, several universities have switched to the plus/minus grading system, but Carnegie Mellon remains old school. While other universities have decided that a plus/minus system provides more accuracy in grading and increases motivation, a sentiment echoed by some Carnegie Mellon professors, some students here have a different take.
A survey conducted this Oct. by the Carnegie Mellon Undergraduate Student Senate revealed that 85 percent of students, worried about their QPA and graduate school futures, preferred their A/B/C system. The Senate voted 27-1 against endorsing a change. One Carnegie Mellon professor might have a solution that could give the university the pluses of a more precise system without the minuses.
Among the schools that have implemented the shift to a plus/minus system in the last decade is the University of Maryland. Elizabeth Jane Beise, Associate Provost for Academic Planning & Programs, said her school switched to plus/minus grading back in 2012 because “it provides a more nuanced evaluation” while, according to their investigation, having “very little impact on the overall GPA” across the student body.
Carnegie Mellon’s system has been in place for at least four decades, but Vice Provost of Education Amy Burkert told The Tartan that changing to plus/minus has been floated before, most recently in the 90s. No consensus was reached then for the undergraduate system, so a plus/minus approach was approved only for graduate students and midterm grades.
However, many Carnegie Mellon professors would welcome the switch. Assistant Professor of Teaching for Psychology, Kody Manke, emphasized that plus/minus systems provide more precise grades. “I think it’s suboptimal to have larger bins,” he said. “If you have any accuracy in your measurement instrument, it seems silly to just make it less accurate by blunting it.”
The current system essentially says, “the difference between a 79.6 and an 89.4 is less of a difference between an 89.4 and an 89.6,” said Manke. Instead, a plus/minus system would mean that “that consequence will be a third of a QPA point” difference rather than a whole point.
“Even though I try to be more precise with rubrics and numbers, when I come down to somebody right on the line, I feel like it’s very hard to know [what grade they deserve],” said John Soluri, Associate Professor in the Department of History.
History lecturer Mark Hauser, who graduated with a Ph.D. in History from Carnegie Mellon in the spring, said pluses and minuses act as “a motivational tool.” Currently a student with an 81 at midterm, which would be a B- under a different system, has little incentive to work harder as it’s likely they won’t exceed a B by semester’s end.
“If a student is able to see a more nuanced final grade it can be more rewarding for that student,” argued Hauser, and this means a plus/minus system “can inspire a student who might otherwise be reluctant to follow through on the final essays.”
David Kosbie, Associate Teaching Professor in the Computer Science Department, said the less exact grading “creates undue pressure on students.”
Many students, however, reject that argument, focusing instead on their desires for As over A-minuses. First-year Electrical and Computer Engineering major Arvin Wu said he prefers the current system “because it reduces the time students take to achieve perfect grades.” In a plus/minus system, Wu suggested, “students will have to put in more time and resources in studying when they have already nearly mastered the material” to get from an A- to an A+.
Added stress was a major reason listed by students in the Senate’s investigation into the plus/minus grading system. Student senator Teddy Warner, a junior majoring in chemistry, explained that in programs where QPA is crucial because you have to apply to graduate school, they’re aiming for an A, so they’d have to aim for a 94 instead of a 90 in a plus/minus system.
Burkert noted that the Provost’s Office is “open to further discussion and investigation on this matter.” One Carnegie Mellon professor has a compromise plan that could increase accuracy without disrupting the critical A-range. Mark Stehlik, Teaching Professor in the Computer Science Department, said that while he thinks “plus/minus grades are a good thing in the main” because of improved accuracy, he understands why students fret about losing out.
“The biggest sticking point for students is an A-,” he explained, “because A+’s at Carnegie Mellon would be rarer than hen’s teeth, so if you get an A- you have lost your potential 4.0 and it will never be reclaimed because you will not get a corresponding A+ to offset it.”
With this in mind, Stehlik is proposing a modified plus/minus system which will “not give plus and minus grades in the A range,” with the grades going A, then B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, and so on. This would prevent added stress for students aiming to maintain a 4.0 GPA while also giving a B+ student the grade they deserve and helping to motivate a B- student at midterm to put in the work to improve their grade.
“I respect the students’ angst in this space,” said Stehlik, referring to the concerns over stress, “But I also want to be respectful of faculty’s desire to be more accurate.”

On Thursday, a group of students played dead in the center of campus to raise awareness about climate change. They lay on their backs and stayed still for hours while surrounded by a set of faux-grave stones, painted with foreboding messages. “We acted too late,” read one. “Business as usual = death,” read another.
The students belonged to Sustainable Earth, a small student organization aiming to encourage living sustainable. Nicole Shi, the president of Sustainable Earth, called the form of protest a “die-in.” Shi laid down and started the die-in at 8 a.m., before any classes began. “It was 28 degrees,” said Shi. “I was definitely bundled up. I wore like 8 layers plus a blanket.” She participated for nine hours, with a few breaks, until 5 p.m.
Sustainable Earth used to focus on personal forms of sustainable living, but in recent years they’ve become more politically active. “Politics was no longer something that we could ignore,” Shi said, “we realized that we really had to ramp up our political efforts.” Shi continued, “especially with the 2020 elections coming up, and also how Trump has been drawing back on a lot of environmental policies.”
Sustainable Earth has adopted a more intense tone in response to the political climate. The organization’s die-in was part of their campus takeover week, during which they tabled to advocate for political participation, and painted the fence with a quote from Greta Thunberg’s address to the United Nations: “Our house is on fire.” They also co-hosted a watch party for the democratic debate with The Roosevelt Institute, Students for Warren, Tartans for Bernie, and Swing Left.
Shi believes that we’re already seeing the effects of climate change, and researchers agree. One team of health and climate scientists from the University of Wisconsin and the World Health Organization calculated that global warming is responsible for nearly 150,000 deaths annually.  that global warming is responsible for nearly 150,000 deaths annually. Their findings were published in Nature, a reputable science journal, in 2008.
“Climate change is not putting a trigger to your head. It’s not that direct,” said Shi. “It’s a slow build up of effects, but I think we’re definitely going in a direction that is very depressing, and it’s scary.”
In the 2016 election, nearly half of the voting population did not cast a ballot. Shi is concerned that if that turnout continues to be low, environmental issues will end up on the back burner.
Sustainable Earth has been working to advocate for political participation, but they aren’t planning to endorse any candidates. Sustainable Earth recently made cards that blindly show the environmental policies of the top-polling presidential candidates. The front of the cards show the policies, and the candidates’ names are only visible on back side.
Shi thinks that it is important to live sustainably, but that advocating for environmentally-friendly policy is the most effective way to combat climate change.
“For example, in Pennsylvania, a lot of bills are being passed for more cracker plants, and that will essentially make Pennsylvania a cancer alley. That’s something that’s being voted on now, but it’s something that’s going to affect you if you’re still living here in five years,” Shi said.
“I think that people find climate change so impossible to solve that its almost debilitating,” said Shi. “But I think that we need as many people as possible advocating for it because... even if the effects by 2030 are going to be irreversible... we still have time and we still need to remain hopeful.”

Last week, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette published no bylines in their paper. Their byline strike against the owners of the paper, Block Communications, Inc. (BCI), the editorializing and megalomaniacal owners of the paper, targets the numerous and repeated behaviors that have degraded public trust in the journalistic standards of the Post-Gazette.
On a Friday night in February, J.R. Block, the publisher of the Post-Gazette, burst into the newsroom in a tizzy. That night, people in the newsroom made four incident reports. These reports suggested that Block came into the newsroom acting erratically, not only making the staffers uncomfortable but also his own daughter cry. Block forced his daughter to take a photo in front of a sign on the workers’ union board that read “Shame on the Blocks!” and was reported by another staffer to have said, “Do you want to be high class or low class? You’re a Block; you’re one of us! You have to learn how to lead!” 
Even before this, Block’s hand had begun to creep into the editorial processes of the paper. In Jan. 2018, Keith Burris, the former editorial page director, wrote an infamous opinion piece titled, “Reason as Racism,” which begins with the line, “Calling someone a racist is the new McCarthyism.” Burris appears to be the right-hand man of J.R. BCI considering his quick progression up the corporate ladder at BCI, where he went from an editorial director at the Toledo Blade to the VP/Editorial Director of all Block Newspapers. 
Burris is a central figure in this strike, with the union for the Post-Gazette voting no confidence in his and J.R. Block’s leadership of the newspaper. A press release from the Newspaper Guild specifically cites Burris and the Blocks for their complicity in pushing out or firing multiple newsroom managers since Burris’ rise to control at the paper. The two of them are responsible for forcing out cartoonist and former executive editor Rob Rogers and recent Carnegie Mellon hire, David Shribman, executive editor and former Vice President of the Post-Gazette. Burris now holds both positions. In addition, the press release states that 16 journalists and three newsroom managers, unnamed in the release, left or were fired as a result of the Block-Burris teaming. 
For these reasons and more, The Tartan Editorial Board supports the Post-Gazette’s staff's decision to strike. The union workers at the Post-Gazette have not seen a pay increase in a decade. Their insurance premiums keep rising. No contract between the Guild and the Blocks has been in place for three years. Their workplace is an increasingly toxic environment. And most worryingly, the journalistic goals of the newsroom are in danger. For these reasons, we support the staff of the Post-Gazette.
The goal of journalism — prioritizing facts over ideology or profit — is in danger, and J.R. Block personifies that danger. The Blocks do not care about journalism, only the bottom line. While it’s a necessary evil to make sure the books are in the black, the Blocks have taken the monetization of the Post-Gazette too far.
Since the early 90s, when Block Communications bought out the Pittsburgh Press, then the larger paper, and folded it into the Post-Gazette, they have spent every minute "trimming the fat" of the paper. They’ve eliminated journalistic staff and cut their pay. They’ve cut the days of print publication down to three per week from a daily publication. This byline strike is the latest action by the workers, not only to retain their freedom but to retain some semblance of journalistic ethics, in spite of the overwhelming forces of monetization that Block has pushed onto his asset. 
The byline strike is also the last gasp of the regional, daily newspaper. Pittsburgh has seen its newspapers steadily close since its heyday. The city is not alone, as regional newspapers close across the country. With that said, other newspapers and other models of monetization will have to pick up the slack. College newspapers, weekly news, and online subscription news services are now responsible for the work that was, until recently, dedicated to the print news services like the Post-Gazette. 
At The Tartan, we recognize our responsibility to report on the news in our community, and we will continue to do whatever it takes to fulfill our mission. Newspapers may be disappearing across the country, but the job of journalism is still necessary. Without it, valuable information at the local and regional levels will be lost, and the readers of news will be without local political coverage and personal stories about economic and social change.
Newspapers are often called the first line of history, as they are where we go to understand the way the world works in our regions. Without local news, we, as readers, are cast adrift in the national milieu, wondering what any of this means at home. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette is not just an important asset to J.R. Block, but an asset to the city of Pittsburgh. We cannot lose the voice that the Post-Gazette provides.

When I talked to Carnegie Mellon University alumnus and Waitress star Drew Gehling, I asked him what advice he would give to incoming and newly-admitted acting and musical theatre majors.
“The hardest part about being a first-year and a second-year at Carnegie Mellon University for me,” he mused, “was not being able to be on stage.”
Gehling referenced the fact that first-year and sophomore acting and musical theatre majors are not allowed to act in Carnegie Mellon School of Drama productions: on the main stage or otherwise. From an outsider’s perspective, this limitation seemed a little strange.
“It seems barbaric and counterproductive for a training program to not allow its performing arts students to get on stage and do the thing that they came to school to do,” Gehling said, “And it’s only been time away that I’ve realized the utter brilliance of that tenet of the school curriculum.”
“It all comes down to the motto of the school,” he continued. “Andrew Carnegie said, ‘my heart is in the work.’ And what I think is that everyone who’s coming here is a gifted performer. They’re good on stage. That has become clear over the 18-or-so plus years of your life up until this point.” Here, he shifts briefly to the School of Drama’s perspective. “What we’re gonna train you to do when you get here is to look beyond the glory of being on stage and find — in your work — something to be passionate about other than the prestige and applause that come with performance. Because if there’s nothing else about the profession besides the prestige and the applause that you’re aspiring to, you’ll never be fulfilled in your work.”
“The most important part of your work is loving the work itself,” he said. “And if you love the work itself, then everything else will just be like the gravy — and that’ll be just the goodies. Because the show that you’re in will not always be great; the TV shows you’re on will not always be renewed; the films that you devote large chunks of your life, and personal sacrifices for and to, might not be successful. But, if you love going to work each day and striving to become better at what you do, then every day will be rewarded.”
“To spend two years not being on stage forces you to come ... to come to terms with what else about the profession that you love. And so,” he concludes, “my only advice would be to stick through the two years. It’s for a reason that may not seem immediately clear — and it might not even be clear for several years after that — but it does exist for a reason and it is tested and true in time and time again, which is why it’s the oldest degree-granting [drama] program in the country … it’s difficult, but it’s worth it.’
I wanted to get some input from current drama students. Senior Georgia Mendes, who recently starred in the School of Drama’s production of Or,, shared her thoughts on the policy.
“I actually think it is invaluable that we wait two years to perform,” she stated. “Freshman and sophomore year is solely focused on the training and the individual. And by the time performing comes around we are ready to perform. It also eliminates competition amongst classmates. By the time everyone is a junior or [a] senior, the talent pool is small enough that everyone is guaranteed large roles at least three times. We have plenty of opportunities to perform between Playground and Dancelight.”
Though it may appear that not casting first-years and sophomores is tedious and detrimental to their development, it appears to be, in fact, vital. This process allows acting and musical theatre students to develop a more rounded perspective on their chosen path, and helps prepare them to confront industry challenges they may face in the future.

The past Thursday, Howard County, MD voted to approve a measure that would redraw their school districts to make it less segregated. The county is home to hundreds of thousands of people with a mix of socioeconomic backgrounds that are not well-integrated across the various towns. The issue of desegregation is not exclusive to just one county in Maryland. Northern states, such as Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York, all face the same issue of school segregation with links to historic geographical inequities.
The Howard County measure focuses on two high schools: River Hill and Wilde Lake. Less than five percent of River Hill’s students are from low-income families, while 46 percent of Wilde Lake’s students are from low-income families, many of whom are Black or Hispanic. Contrary to the beliefs and statements from detractors of the redraw, Wilde Lake is a good school. Wilde Lake students excel, even if their standardized test scores, useless indicators of how well a school does, are lower than River Hill’s. 
Howard County’s decision is a great idea. Economic and racial diversity is important for students, and diversity makes for a better learning experience. It creates students who are more aware, and it lessens the subconscious — in many cases, overt, racist, and classist — biases that people from privileged backgrounds often hold. It is also just a good policy for the district, addressing the historical mistakes of redlining and white flight that segregated the county, while tackling the issue of overcrowding. 
Some common arguments against the redistricting measure involve the ideas of inconvenience, students being separated from friend groups, and school choice. They completely miss the point. While the first two points are just individual concerns that don’t outweigh the benefits of redistricting at all, the third argument is incredibly troubling. There is no real choice for many in the first place. The low-income families whose children go to Wilde Lake can’t afford to live in the same places many of the detractors of the desegregating policy live. With the argument of school choice, the anti-desegregation movement correlates the value of the school to the price of housing. But if that’s the case, the only people with any choice are the privileged, anti-desegregation crowd. 
This issue hits home for me in two different ways. The first reason is that I come from a suburb where the majority of the people are of the same demographic as a lot of the anti-desegregation movement’s proponents: privileged white “liberals” who are for social justice on paper, but would be uncomfortable seeing black people in the neighborhood. But the second reason, and what really prompted me to write this, is that one of the main figures in the anti-desegregation movement in Howard County is Indian — Dr. Hemant Sharma. It was just another reminder of the racism that plagues the Asian community.
Dr. Sharma’s main reason for advocating against the policy is that he thinks that it will harm those the policy is trying to help. He wants to make it clear that the people against anti-desegregation are certainly not racist, and that he acknowledges the concerns shared by black people. So, if he really cares about the plight of low income, non-Asian minorities, why is he against the redistricting measure? Many in the county's Asian community are against the policy. It’s not because they care about what it means or who it impacts. They just don’t want to send their kids to school with black or Hispanic kids, especially if those kids come from a less affluent background. 
I can’t speak for this statistically, but I can talk anecdotally. My general experience with Asians when talking about race is infuriating. For example, I know many of my own Asian family friends were completely for the affirmative action lawsuit led by Asians against Harvard. Instead of focusing on how Harvard regularly accepts rich, white legacy students, they cited underrepresented minorities as the reason it’s hard for Asians to get into Harvard. It’s not like every Asian tiger parent in the world wants their kid to apply to Harvard, one of the reasons why the acceptance rate of Asians at Harvard would be lower. These Asian parents attack the black students because they think they’re inferior, whether they want to admit it overtly or not. 
The same philosophy applies to the fake white liberals that a lot of the Asian community try to emulate. They want to keep their privilege as much as they can. Whether or not they want to admit it, that same feeling of superiority Asians have over black people is there. They are all for being white saviors and desegregating other school districts, but as soon as it’s their own, they’ll be up in arms. It’s been happening since Brown v. Board, and it’s depressing to see history repeating itself. 
The worst part is how cognizant the fake white liberals are about the historical parallels between past segregationists and their movement. The website for the anti-desegregation movement tried hard to make sure it looks different from past anti-desegregation movements. Don’t say use the term “forced bussing,” but say that you don’t want longer bus rides. Say that you love your school, rather than not wanting to go to some other school. They try to make such an effort to superficially separate from themselves from racists of the past, but they’re still racist, no matter how hard they try. 
Howard County made a good decision with this vote. There is not enough real action at any systemic level to deal with racism in the U.S. If you’re going to be against something that addresses this, at least own up to the fact that racism is affecting your decision. If you at least do that, we can have better discussions to effectively address the issues of systemic racism in the U.S.

Editor's note: this is a satirical piece intended to poke fun at the Royal Family.
Queen Elizabeth II announced in an interview with the BBC last Friday that, upon careful, thoughtful, and deliberate consideration, she had decided that it would be in the interest of the Crown for the Royal family to part ways with Prince Andrew. 
“I am sad to announce this decision. I did not truly understand the consequences of [Prince Andrew’s] actions until everyone started abandoning him.” 
The Queen said her original stance was influenced by Lady Colin Campbell, an advanced robot created in a Versace factory who is one of the last of her kind. The Queen frequently trusts the robot for advice. 
“[Lady Campbell] has been letting me down quite often very recently. She told me that there was a distinction between what Andrew did and the crime he was accused of, and I truly believed her. It’s sad to see that she got this situation so wrong. She had already gotten so many things wrong very recently, like letting Meghan into the family.”
The Queen commented that part of her decision was influenced by Prince Andrew’s interview, where he cited his inability to sweat as a reason for why the allegations against him were false. The Queen said that was “hogwash,'' saying that Prince Andrew is “the sweatiest of all of us, even me.” She also said Pizza Express is “the worst place on Earth” and that “not even Andrew liked going there.” 
The Royal family has given controversy a code name: "Pizzagate 2.0: Electric Boogaloo." Queen Elizabeth has turned over the redacted records of the Pizzagate 2.0 plan to members of the media. In the documents, the plan details a complete buyout of Pizza Express, with Prince Andrew as the manager for the full enterprise. He will also be sent to a private manor in Scotland, which will serve as the headquarters for Pizza Express. 
The previous member to be exiled by the Royal family was Princess Diana, who died in an untimely car accident. The Queen said she will take extra steps to ensure the safety of Prince Andrew during his exile. 
“It is a sad day for all of us. But he must face consequences. Frankly, if anything, Andrew has dug his own grave,” she said.
