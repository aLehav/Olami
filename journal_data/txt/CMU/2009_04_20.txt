As its season draws to a close, the 15th-ranked Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team geared up for the University Athletic Association (UAA) championship hosted by the University of Rochester this past weekend. Right before heading out to New York, the Tartans made a quick stop at Grove City College and won 9–0. 
At UAAs, the team came out strong, beating down New York University 7–2 and 18th-ranked University of Chicago 7–2. The Tartans fought a disappointing 8–1 loss to second-ranked Washington University in St. Louis during a long week of competitive play. Carnegie Mellon now has a shot at the regional NCAA championships held in a few weeks, and moves to a season record of 19–7.
“This was a pretty good weekend and everyone played very well,” junior Nikola Ljuboja said. “Our match against Wash. U. was a bit disappointing, but they are a strong team and we knew the competition was tough from the start.”
Against Grove City, the Tartans established their dominance quickly, taking all three doubles and dropping only four games for all three matches. The teams of junior Jon Spero and sophomore Bobby MacTaggart and Ljuboja and junior James Muliawan each won their doubles 8–0, while sophomore Alex Nemerov and junior Ravi Raghavan won 8–4. In singles, the Tartans steamrolled over Grove City, with each player losing no more than seven games each.
In the first day of play at UAAs, the Tartans easily put down NYU 7–2, taking two of three doubles and all but one singles match. At first doubles, Nemerov and senior Yiran Liu won 8–5, followed by a decisive 8–2 win by Muliawan and first-year Jeremy King at second doubles. The Tartans were able to keep their momentum going and took five more wins from NYU. MacTaggart won in a close  4–6, 6–4, 7–6 (10–6). Nemerov also won a tight match 7–6 (7–4), 6–1. King, Liu, and Spero added their respective singles points to the total.
The semifinal match against top-ranked Wash. U. proved to be more than the Tartans could handle, and they were defeated 8–1 after giving up all three doubles and the remaining singles matches. Liu showed an incredible display of mental endurance during his match, after coming back from being down 0–6, 0–3 to win 7–5 (10–8) in the third-set tiebreak. Raghavan put out a commendable effort, barely losing 6–7, 6–3, 10–3 in the third, while Spero had a close first set but lost 7–5, 6–1 in the end.
“After losing nine games in a row, I started playing a bit better and got a lucky break in the second set,” said Liu of his comeback. “I saw an opportunity and just went for it.”
The Tartans were able to regroup for the next round and defeated Chicago 7–2 to take third place. Nemerov and Spero won easily at second and fourth singles 6–3, 6–1 and 6–2, 6–2, respectively, but MacTaggart had a close match, winning 6–2, 4–6, 10–8 in the end. At last singles, Liu only dropped a single game to win 6–1, 6–0, while Raghavan pulled out a win in a close three-set match, 6–4, 3–6, 10–8.
“We really came out focused today and had one of our best matches of the year. The team did what we needed to do this weekend to put ourselves in a good position to make NCAAs,” said coach Andy Girard. “Now we have to wait and see what happens with other teams over the next two weekends.” NCAA selections are announced on May 4.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track and field teams hosted the Tri-Meet with Seton Hill University and Franciscan University in attendance at Gesling Stadium this past Wednesday. Although the meet was unscored, the Tartans did not allow that to detract from their outstanding performances. Both teams showed readiness for the upcoming University Athletic Association (UAA) meet that will be held next weekend at home.
Senior Ashley Rothwell took first in both the hammer throw and shot put with distances of 36.66 meters and 11.08 meters, respectively. 
The Tartans posted a number of second-place finishes, including sophomore Courtney Baker’s 4:55.12 time in the 1500 meters. First-year Luci Laffitte finished second in the 100-meter hurdles with a time of 16.02, and the 4x100 relay team of Laffitte, Baker, senior Emily Giacomarra, and first-year Ivana Moses set a new school record with a time of 51.72. 
Also claiming second place was first-year Cecily Sunday, who cleared 2.74 meters in the pole vault.
Moses placed in three events prior to the 4x100 relay, finishing strong in the long jump, the triple jump and the 100-meter dash. She posted 5.08 meters in the long jump and 10.96 meters in the triple, both good enough for second place. In the 100-meters dash, she came in third with a time of 13.43.
Finishing strong for the Tartans was the 4x400 relay team of Laffitte, junior Crystal LeePow, Baker, and junior Diane Mattingly, who finished first with a time of 4:04.26.
The men’s team was strong in all events, and a number of its athletes placed this past weekend. Junior Chris Rizzo took first place in the steeplechase, finishing with a season-best time of 9:58.49. A number of Tartans posted season-best times, including sophomore Justin Kurp, who finished first in the 800 meters with a time of 1:55.56; he was followed by classmate Dan Addis, who also posted a season best of 1:57.04.
The Tartans’ distance runners swept the 1500-meter race. Senior Brian Harvey led the pack with a time of 3:55.70, followed by senior Ryan Anderson (3:55.95) and first-year Rob Morhard (4:00.44).
In the 3000-meter race, sophomore J.P. Allera took first in 9:03.09, followed by teammate Morhard (9:08.06) and sophomore Josh Eickmeier, who finished third in 9:34.51.
On the field, first-year Ryan Kissel posted a career-best jump of 6.68 meters and finished first in the event. Also on the field, sophomore Dan Melamed tied his career-best 3.96 meters, a strong enough jump to place second. Junior James Hulley set two new school records in the shot put and the discus. In the shot put, he threw 15.38 meters, and in the discus, 45.56 meters. First-year Anthony Hernandez, senior Chris Fornataro, and Hulley swept the hammer throw with Hernandez throwing a season best of 49.17 meters, followed by Fornataro (47.48 meters) and Hulley (45.82 meters).
The Tartans will next compete in the UAA Championships hosted this upcoming Saturday and Sunday at Gesling Stadium.

The Fred B. Kravetz Invitational pulled the Carnegie Mellon men’s golf team away from the Spring Carnival festivities and onto the links, giving the Tartans a third place finish with a two-day total of 608 (310, 298), just behind Huntingdon College and Skidmore College. Senior Alex Timmons also received a fourth University Athletics Association (UAA) Athlete of the Week honor. 
‘The Tartans finished the first day of competition at the Oak Hill Country Club in second place with a team total of 298. The team then went on to grab a 310 at the Irondequoit Country Club on the second day. Carnegie Mellon surpassed the host University of Rochester by three strokes.
Timmons led the way for the Cardinal and Gray, recording a one-over-par 72 that landed him a third place standing for the first day. He went on to card a 77 on Saturday, which put him in a tie for fourth. 
Following Timmons, first-years Terence Einhorn and Michael Cheng tied for the fourth position, both carding a 75 on Friday. Einhorn and Cheng recorded 81 and 84 on the final day. Senior Joshua Chen shot a five-over-par 76 and junior Christopher Lee carded a 78. Chen went on to record a team-low 75 on Saturday to finish ninth overall at the tournament with a 151. Lee shot a final round of 77 to finish with a two-day total of 155.
The Fred. B. Kravetz Invitational marked the final competition for Carnegie Mellon before the team enters the University Athletic Association championships to be held this weekend in Atlanta, Ga. The event will be held Sunday through Monday.

With the sun finally coming out of hiding, dresses and sleeveless tees are once again making their appearance on campus. No longer must we hide under North Face fleeces and layers of sweatpants; instead, Carnegie Mellon students are free to play Frisbee on the Cut and go for walks along Forbes Avenue. The temperatures are rising and students are being lured into the sunshine. But little do they know just how sunny of a decision they are really making.
It has been proven time and time again that exercise is good for one's health, and, fortunately, our campus is a relatively active one. What is not as commonly known, however, are the benefits of being active outdoors. The website exerciseoutdoor.com preaches the many positive outcomes of getting sweaty under the sun. It also lists common outdoor activities that are not only enjoyable, but also very healthy, such as kayaking, skiing, jogging, beach volleyball, and tennis. But why bother making it a point to skip the gym and hit the sidewalk? The list of answers to this question seems to be endless.
First of all, the sun can be man's best friend. While it is obviously true that one can get too much of the sun, therefore reversing the benefits, by keeping your exposure to a moderate level and avoiding any burns, you can treat your body to a heavy dose of a commonly lacking nutrient, Vitamin D. Vitamin D has been shown to help prevent cancer, bone disease and depression, and it lowers and controls a person's insulin levels, helping in weight control. The sun can also aid in treating seasonal affective disorder, in which a person's mood decreases with cold or dreary weather. 
But the health benefits of outdoor fun do not end there. Simply breathing in outdoor air can be good for your body. Think about it: the average person spends over 90 percent of his or her time indoors. All of this time inside means breathing in an unhealthy amount of dust and recirculated air, along with being exposed to unnatural fluorescent light. Getting outside means being closer to nature, and closer to the sources of freshness on this Earth. Many have reported feeling better spiritually as a result of exercising outside. Even more have reported an increase in balance and flexibility. Running or walking on uneven pavement can strengthen the ligaments, tendons, and stabilizers we often do not use during regular activity. This can lead to a decrease in injury and/or strain. A study by the National Recreation and Parks Association shows that people with better access to outdoor parks and those who participate in outdoor recreation have fewer trips to the doctor. 
Aside from the direct health benefits, with the nation having serious concerns for the fate of our planet and our piggy banks, outdoor activities may just be the solution to our biggest problems. Working out outdoors is as simple as walking out of the house. You can do this anywhere and virtually anytime, somewhat dependent on weather. Since there is no need to drive to a gym, you may be reducing your carbon footprint. And with no need for a gym membership, you can save a lot of cash. All of that green is looking pretty good right now. Pair those advantages with the numerous improvements you may feel inside your body, and it seems almost ridiculous to spend a whole day inside. So next time you realize that the most light you are getting is from a computer or TV screen, take that homework outside and enjoy some fresh air. Maybe take a break and go for a little bike ride or stroll down to Shadyside. Try it. Your body will thank you later.

Junior James Hulley is making a big name for himself on the Carnegie Mellon track and field team that matches his physical stature. Hulley set school records in the shot put and discus events this past Wednesday in the home tri-meet with Seton Hill University, Franciscan University, and Duquesne University. This is continuing a pattern of success from earlier this year, as Hulley and senior runner Brian Harvey represented the Tartans at  the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships. When asked what he was most looking forward to upon coming to Carnegie Mellon, Hulley replied, "I was looking forward to being a collegiate athlete when I came to CMU. I really enjoy being on the track team. I know athletics are not really idolized here at this school, but I really enjoy being a part of something bigger than myself."
With backgrounds in engineering from his father and art from his mother, Hulley had a penchant for building and taking things apart as a child. Hulley maintains this inclination by pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering. He hopes to stay athletically active throughout his life, while also pursuing a career in mechanical engineering and having a family. Hulley sees himself volunteering as a high school throwing coach, with the possibility of competing in the masters division of track and field. 
Hulley is a native of Northhampton, Mass., and is the youngest of seven children, with two of his sisters adopted from Russia. His close-knit home ties have kept him motivated to perform in athletics and academics. He will be spending most of this upcoming summer in Pittsburgh preparing for his final season of competition, but will be making visits to family and friends back in New England. While on campus, Hulley is involved with his fraternity, Sigma Phi Epsilon, and participates in its activities and efforts, most recently with Spring Carnival Booth and Buggy.
Unfortunately for Hulley, his parents discouraged him from playing football, which is what he would loved to have played if he had not been participating in throwing events. However, he is excelling in the sport that throwers like himself prefer to call "Field and Track," and is looking to continue his success as the season comes to a close in the next few weeks.  
The Tartans will be hosting the University Athletic Association outdoor track and field championships this coming weekend, April 25 and 26, where they look to defend their conference championship title from last season. The action will begin at 10 a.m. and continue throughout the day in Gesling Stadium.

Rooting for a losing team is a mighty tricky business. As sports fans, we initially sign up to follow a team through the championship years and the no-chance-at-playoffs years; just as you can’t truly appreciate the good until you’ve had the bad, you can’t truly feel the pure joy of finally bringing home the championship trophy unless you’ve endured many seasons of almosts. But what if you wait and wait, yet see no signs of change? No signs of improvement? What if your team can’t even reach the “almost” mark?
Take, for example, the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Pirates have played 12 games as of today and, as expected, they are hovering about the .500 mark in the win percentage column. Given the recent history of the franchise, I doubt many are surprised. The banner on the Pirates’ website boasts: “Pride. Passion. Pittsburgh Pirates.” Ironic, for a team that averaged 52.4 percent of full attendance capacity last season. Yes, I see the Pirates, but where’s the pride and the passion? I stepped into PNC Park last week, but sensed only nonchalance and heard “oh well” sighs. After 16 seasons of sub-.500, can fans throw in the towel without guilt of disloyalty?
The way I see it, you have two options: hang on to that last barely visible thin thread of hope, or just relax.
I’m with option A. As a New York Mets fan, it’s quite a challenge to try to make sense of the last two season-ending collapses. This off-season, the world champion Philadelphia Phillies’ ace Cole Hamels called the division rival Mets “choke artists.” Such a public insult really isn’t going to help Hamels’ chances of becoming my favorite pitcher, but at the current time, I can’t much dispute his claim. The Mets have to do better in September and October, but whether or not they do, I’ll still follow the team next season. Not everyone is cut out for sticking through such a ridiculous way to lose a division pennant or long stretches of being ordinary. However, it takes a lot of character, you know?
In all seriousness, while the sports fan in me would never admit to this in public, there’s no shame in option B. At the end of the day, sports is just entertainment. If you’re tired of your team choking or not investing in improving, then pick another team or enjoy the game with no strings attached. For the baseball fans out there, whether you’re a Pirates fan or not, PNC Park is still a beautiful stadium and baseball is still baseball. Do you remember when you were a kid and just being at the game was enough? You got your tickets at the box office, ate hot dogs like you’d never tasted anything better, and watched in awe as the athletes played ball under the stadium lights. When did we stop appreciating such an idyllic game?
Just remember, if the Pirates don’t make the playoffs this season and October 4 is the last game, the sun will still rise October 5. 
Now if the Mets don’t make the playoffs, that’s a whole other story....

We’ve all seen it — the white line snaking its way down the steep ramps past Doherty and Wean Halls. However, not many students know that it’s actually there for a reason, unlike the snowman statue outside the aforementioned building. The white painted line is an integral part of Mobot races, a less popular though still important Carnival tradition that has been going on for 15 years now.
Mobot races center on an autonomous, student–or–staff built (depending on the division) mobile robot, which must follow the white line down the hills and through the gates. Many robots fail to make it through the first few gates; however, this year, some Mobots did make it through the course, or at least fairly far through, and were awarded prizes.
In the undergraduate division, the first, second, and third place teams were awarded prizes, and in the open division, the award went to the top team. The undergraduate awards were given to Team Zoidberg, Team REWIND, and Team 108, respectively, and the open-class award went to Team Mike and Jeff, who also set a new course record, breaking their own previous record from the year before. The first-place winner received $1000, the second $500, and the third $250, with the open-class team receiving $250 in addition to another $250 prize for setting a course record. 
All Mobot winners, in addition to the cash prizes, have their names inscribed on a Mobot plaque in the Engineering and Science Library. The Mobots’ designs, while all different, are all similar in their use of some type of line-detection algorithm. This allows the Mobot to go through the course by using the algorithm to sense whether the Mobot is able to “see” the painted line, and thus whether  it is going on the right path. And this algorithm is made more complicated by the fact that, at one point in the course, the painted line splits into two separate curves, which together form figure eights, and the Mobot must decide which path to take and keep following the correct path to the finish line. 
First-place team Zoidberg consisted of Mark Hahnenberg and Jake Poznanski, both sophomore computer science majors. Poznanski explained that the key to their design was the mobot’s ability to be easily taken apart and put back together. This year was the team’s first year at the Mobot races, and they plan to come back next year with some improvements to the design. “We didn’t get to make the decision-making part of the algorithm working, so we’d like to fix that for next year,” Poznanski said. 
Members of Team REWIND were Daniel Benjamin, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major; Wil Hamilton, a sophomore mechanical engineering major; Clarissa Hann, a first-year mechanical engineering major; and Richard Hong, a junior computer science major. Hamilton explained that his team’s design went through changes throughout the design process. “We started out with a totally different design, and changed it a little bit at a time. We also had to completely change the motors.” Hamilton also stated that the motors were something that his team would like to change for next year’s race, to make the mobot go faster. Team 108 had teammates Rentaro Matsukata, a first-year electrical and computer engineering major, and David Soamchand, a first-year business administration major. 
Matsukata explained that the team’s mobot had drive wheels in the back, and front wheels that rotated with the motor, along with two sensors to allow the Mobot to stay on the line. The team wrote the software as they went along, and wasn’t even sure it would work because they didn’t get to test it at all, finishing only about 15 minutes before the races began. In the open class, the winning team was made up of Robotics Institute staff members Michael Licitra and Jeff McMahill. Their design used four-wheel steering, 16 infrared sensors, a suspension system, and a filtering system that helped the mobot detect one or two of the white lines and pick the center, left, or white line. “Our design was based on an RC car, which is fairly fast and gives you lots of parts for pretty cheap. It’s also easy to stack components on top of the model,” McMahill said. The team would like to compete in future Mobot races and increase the speed of their mobot again, though they’re not sure how to do so at this time.

Technology has come a long way in a short amount of time. In the 1980s, a movie was produced that warned us about the dangers of robotics: The Terminator. According to the movie, robots from the future were agile, powerful, almost indestructible, and bent on destroying the human race.
Luckily, robotics is not at that stage yet. However, researchers are developing suits that would enable humans to mimic these robots in terms of physical capabilities. These so-called “powered exoskeletons” are exactly as they sound; they are skeletal frames worn by humans that have some power supply for movement. This would enable the wearer to lift objects many times heavier than he or she would be able to without the suit, or they could assist the wearer in other forms of movements. A powered exoskeleton is a simple concept: meld man with machine. 
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has outlined five structural challenges to overcome in order to build a useful exoskeleton. It will need to be strong, lightweight, and flexible. A long-lasting power source is necessary for the suit to run; ideally, the power source would be nearly silent. The user must be able to control the suit freely and naturally. Movement of the suit is powered by actuators, which are devices that transform an electrical signal into movement. The movement of the actuators must be smooth and quiet. Finally, the suit must be able to move like a human would. All of these would be requirements for a human to be able to interact with the natural environment.
An article in The Independent describes the first powered exoskeleton, Hardiman, developed in the 1960s by General Electric and the United States military. However, it weighed 1500 pounds, which was much too heavy and bulky for any practical use. Another significant advancement was initiated in 1986 by a U.S. Army Ranger, Monty Reed, who had suffered from a broken back as a result of parachuting. An article on seattlepi.com describes how Reed later submitted ideas for the LIFESUIT, a powered exoskeleton that mimicked a human walking motion. It was completed in 2001, and since then different, more advanced versions have been built. Other current models of the powered exoskeleton include the XOS Exoskeleton, built by Sarcos, which mimics human movement and allows the wearer to lift enormous amounts of weight while moving fluidly and quickly, and the ExoHiker suit, which allows wearers to carry heavy weights on their backs while regenerating power through every step the user takes, much like hybrid vehicles regenerate electrical power when driving. A video of the Sarcos-powered exoskeleton can be viewed on engadet.com.
The primary use of an exoskeleton is to enhance the physical abilities of the user. If it were to be used in the military, soldiers would be able to move heavy objects in their paths, carry heavier loads, and wear heavier protective clothing, all without feeling the strain of the additional weight. In addition, walking speed could be increased; carrying over a hundred pounds of supplies would slow the best-conditioned soldiers, but with a powered exoskeleton, researchers are looking at speeds greater than 10 m.p.h. even with heavy loads. 
Furthermore, other physical abilities, like jumping, could be improved, all to help soldiers maneuver around their environment more quickly and easily. Of course, these suits would have more functions than just military purposes. This technology is being considered for improved movement for the elderly and rehabilitation purposes. They would also be helpful for rescue work, allowing people to clear heavy debris or protecting them from a dangerous environment. Researchers in Japan are designing suits for nurses to help lift and carry patients.

Possibly one of the most devastating genetic disorders, Tay-Sachs disease is fatal, and children who are diagnosed with the disease rarely live beyond four years. Children with Tay-Sachs disease appear normal at birth, but when they are around 3 to 6 months old, they develop symptoms ranging from deafness and blindness to seizures and dementia, which eventually results in death. The Mayo Clinic elaborates on certain other symptoms of the disease that include decreased eye contact in infants, lack of crawling or smiling, and exhibiting slow body growth. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, those suffering from this disorder also have a characteristic “cherry-red spot” in their eyes. In fact, it was this cherry-red spot that first led to the characterization of the disease by British ophthalmologist Warren Tay in 1881.
Considering the debilitating effects of the disorder, it is hard not to wonder what causes the disease. The Genetics Home Reference website describes Tay-Sachs as a disease caused by the build-up of a fatty substance called GM2 ganglioside in the brain. The buildup of the ganglioside is caused by disrupted activity of the enzyme beta-hexosaminidase A, which is present in the lysosomes of cells and is normally responsible for degrading GM2 ganglioside. If beta-hexosaminidase A malfunctions, GM2 ganglioside builds up inside the cells to toxic levels. This buildup is particularly prominent in neurons in the brain and spinal cord, and hence the disease affects the nervous system. The hereditary component of the disease is due to the fact that individuals with the disease have a mutation in the HEX A gene, which is responsible for creating the beta-hexosaminidase A enzyme. A mutation in the HEX A gene causes defects in the formation of the enzyme, which prevents the enzyme from being able to degrade GM2 ganglioside.
In spite of the diseases being fatal, according to the National Genome Research Institute, one in 250 people possesses the mutated version of HEX A. With such a high rate of occurrence, it would seem that the disease is fairly common and should affect a large number of people. To understand why this is not the case, we need to go back to the basics of genetics, which state that genes always come in pairs; hence, there is a pair of HEX A genes in the body. If only one of these genes is mutated, the person is perfectly normal and shows no symptoms of the disease. People with just one copy of the gene are called carriers of the disease. The disease manifests itself only when a person contains two mutated copies of the gene. Children receive one of gene of the pair from one parent and the other from the other parent. Thus a child of one carrier parent and one parent without the mutated gene will be perfectly normal; children of two carriers, however have a 25 percent chance of contracting the disease. As stated on www.tay-sachs.org, the disease is fairly common in those of Eastern European Jewish descent, with one in 27 of them being carriers. Currently, there is no cure for the disease, and the disease is fatal for anyone with two defective copies of the HEX A gene. Tests for detecting whether one is a carrier of the gene do exist. The tests are simple blood tests and can easily help couples decide whether they want to have children if both parents turn out to be carriers.
Although the form of Tay-Sachs described here is the most common form seen, a rarer form also exists which affects those of an older age group. Juvenile Tay-Sachs occurs due to a deficiency, rather than a complete lack, of the functioning beta-hexosaminidase A enzyme. Symptoms for juvenile Tay-Sachs usually develop between the ages two to five years and such children usually live up to around 15 years of age. Another even milder form of Tay-Sachs affects children and adults alike, from anywhere between the ages of 5 to 30 years. The symptoms of this version of the disease are also milder and include slurred speech, an unsteady gait, and sometimes mental disorders.

Mice produce eggs later in life 
Earlier this week Chinese scientists Kang Zhou and Ji Wu of Shanghai Jiao Tong University detected, in young and old mice, germ-line cells that produce unfertilized eggs. This defies the long-held assumption that women cannot produce eggs after birth. The researchers scanned the mouse cells for a protein called vasa homolog that is found only in the germ-lines in a mouse’s ovaries. The germ-line cells generate all the eggs a woman has in her lifetime.
After the researchers detected the vasa-producing cells, the cells were removed and tagged with a fluorescent protein. When these fluorescent germ-line cells were injected inside mice, the mice produced some offspring that were green. This indicates that the offspring were produced from eggs made by the injected germ-line cells.

Epilepsy drug harms newborns
A new study has shown that the children of mothers who took the epilepsy drug Valproate during pregnancy have been shown to have lower IQs than children whose mothers took other anti-seizure medication. It has been known for a while that this drug may be linked to other birth defects, such as spina bifida. However this study is the biggest one to prove a connection between Valproate and lower IQ.
The study followed women in United States and the United Kingdom and found that toddlers of mothers who took Valporate had IQs of 92, while toddlers whose mothers took Lamotrigine or phenytoin had IQs between 98 and 101.

Broccoli helps prevent  cancer
A study in Japan has found that eating two and a half ounces of baby broccoli for two months may protect people against a common stomach bug linked to gastritis, ulcers, and stomach cancers. Broccoli contains sulforaphane, a biochemical that seems to trigger that production of enzymes that protects the gut from oxygen radicals, DNA-damaging chemicals, and inflammation. 
In this study, researchers gave 25 people in Japan infected with the bacteria 70 grams of broccoli sprouts per day for two months. Another 25 infected people got alfalfa sprouts (that do not have sulforaphane). Those eating broccoli sprouts showed reduced levels of infection and inflammation.

Diabetes may give rise to dementia
Kaiser Permanente researchers tracked the health records of more than 16,000 people with diabetes type II and studied episodes of severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). They then followed patients to track diagnoses of dementia. 
The patients with one severe hypoglycemia episode had a 26 percent increased risk of dementia as compared to those without hypoglycemia, while those with two episodes had an 80 percent increased risk. 
The reasons for this increased risk are still not clear, but researchers think that diabetes drugs that induce hypoglycemia may cause grain-cell death in older people.

Study indicates rapid sea-level rise
After studying the fossils of corals in Mexico, scientists have concluded that 121,000 years ago, there was a 6.5- to 10-foot rise in the sea level within a period of 50 to 100 years. This period marked the last warm gap between the two ice ages.
Scientists believe that this proves the instability of seas and the potential for rapid sea-level rise due to melting of ice in the future. 
The study, published in the journal Nature, was done by measuring the ages of the coral reefs by studying the levels of isotopic thorium in the coral. 
The scientists discovered that at specific levels in the reef, the coral died very rapidly, indicating a sudden rise in sea level; the corals then grew again, but at a point nearly 10 feet higher in elevation, indicating a rise in sea level.

Emergency shuttle ready for launch
The space shuttle Endeavour was rolled to the launch pad last Friday as an emergency back-up for the shuttle Atlantis. Atlantis is scheduled to lift off on May 12 with the mission of undertaking the last servicing call for the Hubble Telescope. 
The Endeavour will be launched to bring the crew of Atlantis back in case of an emergency.
After the death of seven astronauts in the space shuttle Columbia in 2003, NASA has been taking extra precautions to ensure the safety of the astronauts. The International Space Station served as a refuge for astronauts in case of emergencies. However, since the Hubble telescope orbits the earth at a different altitude than the space station, astronauts in the Atlantis would not be able to reach the space station. 
This prompted NASA to have the shuttle Endeavour ready in case of an emergency to bring the astronauts aboard Atlantis back home.

Scientists find ancient bacteria 
A team of researchers from Harvard university and Dartmouth university have discovered a group of bacteria living in isolation under an Antarctic glacier. 
The species are similar to modern species living in marine environments. Scientists believe that this suggests that the newly found microbes were once part of a larger group that lived in an open sea and then got segregated.
These microbes live by breathing iron that seeps through the rock using a sulfur catalyst.

EPA declares six gases as hazardous
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declared six heat-trapping gases as potential health hazards last Friday. The gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
This announcement was made after the culmination of a study conducted by the EPA on the concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere and their effects on global warming and human health. The report published by the EPA on this study is titled “Assessment of the Impacts of Global Change on Regional U.S. Air Quality: A Synthesis of Climate Change Impacts on Ground-Level Ozone.”

Carnival at Carnegie Mellon is not just any other carnival — it’s the epitome of creativity, innovation, and excitement, made possible by the campus community. But one of the most important elements of Carnival that reflects the creativity of the campus is Booth. Every year, the members of fraternities, sororities, and a range of cultural, academic, and service organizations build and design booths according to a common theme.
Booth is not just a display of design and architectural expertise; it is also a competition. Organizations not participating in the main competition build blitz booths instead.
This year’s theme for Carnival was “Epic Adventures,” and Carnival-goers were overwhelmed by a sense of nostalgia when seeing the different booths, as many of them evoked recollections of some of everyone’s favorite childhood stories.
From the entrance, Delta Delta Delta’s “Jack and the Bean Stalk” booth was eye-catching and intriguing. The booth was complete with a little flower garden and sparkling green leaves that gave a welcoming feel. Although small, the castle at the top was glittery and fairytale-like, and the booth stayed to true to its purpose and was in the shape of a giant beanstalk. A walk through the inside really felt like an experience of the events of the tale, and the signs telling the story with their storybook-font cutouts on a life-size page really set this booth apart. The colorful decorations and designs were bound to be exciting for children.
In contrast, but still rather captivating, was Kappa Delta Rho’s booth titled “KDR Journeys to the Center of the Earth.” KDR’s booth took its visitors on an actual adventure down through the different layers of the earth’s surface. A passage through the booth was a mark of having survived a perilous feat. 
One of the features of the booth that was quite amusing was an electronic walkway depicting a stream with pebbles that sensed the impact of feet stepping on it, and as a result produced ripples on its smooth surface. The environment was truly epic and the inner Earth-like feel was very realistic. Also fascinating was a large moving drill hanging from the ceiling, and the overall rush of accomplishment felt before exiting the booth.
Moving along on Midway led go Stever House’s Finding Nemo blitz booth. The Stever House community is dedicated to biologically and environmentally friendly practices, and a look inside their booth revealed that they held true to their mission. Even the shells of the tiny sea turtles on display were made by cutting out the ends of green plastic bottles. Laura Filliger, a first-year biological sciences major, explained how working on the booth for Stever House gave her and the team a chance to really get hands-on and work on a major project as first-year students. “[With other booths], a lot of the upperclassmen are doing the really important jobs, while with Stever you are a freshman and you are doing all the important jobs,” she said. The team put together a fun booth and gave visitors a chance to take pictures of their faces in Nemo and Dory cutouts.
Next up was Fringe’s “Fringe: Where the Wild Things Are” booth. Mike Niedzwiecki, a senior chemical engineering major, highlighted their choice of a timeless tale. “We’ve had a lot of people, three generations deep, come in and say ‘Oh, this was my favorite book as a kid,’ and it’s nice to see people’s faces light up,” he said. The detailed paintings of mysterious creatures and lights on the ceiling intended to give the effect of a twinkling sky, making visitors feel as if they were working through a life-size storybook.
Of course, epic adventures can also be portrayed as treasure hunts, and the “Sig Ep presents The Goonies” booth by Sigma Phi Epsilon did just this. What’s more is that the Goonies story is a parallel to SigEp’s story of creating it. Billy Snow, a sophomore architecture major, explained the situation. “[In the movie The Goonies], there is a group of kids completely different from each other, same as our house, who came together to accomplish their mission. In the end, we all came together to this one final design, which is an amazing feat because our house is so diverse,” he said. A look both inside and outside the booth showed the hard work of the entire team that had produced the final product.
On the other side was the Taiwanese Student Association’s “2043 AD” booth — a terrifying look into the future coupled with a caution for environmental conservation. A step into the TSA booth certainly felt like a step into the future. The organization was very accurate in creating props like mailboxes and a fire hydrant. Upon descending on the escalator-like stairs, an announcer with a robotic voice cautioned against environmental hazards and informed listeners of the time the next train was departing. Posters, subway signs, a model of a train compartment, and the overall subway feel were rather eerie and gripping. Very much in line with the theme was the save-the-world game situated at the end of the booth. The concept was meant to stand out as a unique epic adventure.
Also meant to stand out with its bright hot air balloon and cheery clouds was the “Around the World in 80 Days” booth next door by MayurSASA and the International Student Union. Paintings of monuments such as Paris’s Eiffel Tower, London’s Big Ben, the Egyptian Sphinx, and the Indian Taj Mahal, coupled with a rocking boat, made this booth attractive and fun. Also notable were the intricate models of Paris and Egypt. The most interesting part, as Yasaswi Raparla, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major, pointed out, was the making of the hot air balloon. “The hot air balloon is actually made from the fabric used in commercial hot air balloons,” he said. The hot air balloon also made for an enjoyable photo backdrop for many visitors.
From the corner of the eye, it was easy to spot the dome-like structure that was Kappa Kappa Gamma’s “James and the KKGiant Peach.” The choice of story drew people of all ages to the booth, and the three-dimensional pictures of the story were a nice touch and were easy to follow. To top it off, this booth even smelled like peach. The dome was a testament to the team aim of straying from the standard rectangular booth design and using the structure to fit the story. The dome was geodesic — a spherical structure made up of a pattern of self-bracing triangles, which gives a maximum structural advantage. And for those who are still wondering: Yes, the dome was supposed to be a peach.
Overall, all the booths at Carnival were amusing to see, and the hard work put into making them made this year’s Carnival a major success and a memorable event.

On Friday morning, U-Hauls, mechanics, drivers, and fans overtook Tech and Frew Streets as Buggy madness began. After months of early hours for the 13 organizations involved, the buggies were finally revealed and put to the ultimate test.
Participating groups included Alpha Epsilon Pi (AEPi), Beta Theta Pi (Beta), the Carnegie Involvement Association (CIA), Fringe, Kappa Delta Rho (KDR), Phi Kappa Theta (PhiKap), Pi Kappa Alpha (PiKA), Pioneers, Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE), Sigma Nu (SigNu), Sigma Phi Epsilon (SigEp), Spirit, and Student Dormitory Council (SDC).
This year’s race was on a day with amazing weather, had large crowds, and had a clear sense of anticipation lurking in the air.
“I had never seen Buggy and I was just really amazed at how intense everything was, especially at the end,” said Karisa Williams, a first-year materials science and biomedical engineering double major and pusher for Fringe's Women's B team.
Williams noted the excitement of the crowd, saying that many of her friends were already talking about plans to push or drive for organizations next year. This year was not without some major surprises, however. Despite a seven-year record of winning the men’s race, PiKA could not pull it off again.
Friday’s events left PiKA Men's A Team's buggy Chimera in sixth place with a time of 2:10.50, dramatically slower than PiKA’s all-time record from the year before, 2:04.35. This disappointment came with a 2:30.20 for the Men's C team and a disqualification for the Men's B team when the buggy spun out and hit hay bales in the Chute (the fastest point on the course), and had to cross the finish line dragged by a truck.
PiKA was not the only organization's buggy to get disqualified on the first day — there were multiple disqualifications. Beta’s Problem Child was disqualified for a fire safety violation in the team’s truck, one of KDR’s teams was disqualified for a missing pusher, and Fringe’s Men’s D team was disqualified for not having the buggy, Brazen, at the start line ten seconds before the start of the race.
“This was the year of upsets,” said Amanda Sturges, a senior business administration and social and decision sciences major. Sturges said that she could feel the surprise in the air and see it on people’s faces.
PiKA's Men's A Team did step it up in the second day of competition, however — but it was not enough. The team finished with a final time of 2:07.58 after a re-roll caused by interference with SigNu flags in the chute, putting them in third place.
Second place in the men’s competition went to Fringe's A Team, who finished the course at 2:07.25, just barely beating out PiKA's Men's A Team. Fringe's Men's A Team improved their time with a re-roll caused by a broken gun that had given the team two false starts and traumatized the pushers and drivers.
Before both men's re-rolls, PiKA had been in second place with Fringe in third place. Although both teams improved their times with their re-rolls, they switched the order.
“It’s really weird that there were two re-rolls on the second day of competition,” Williams said.
Williams said that re-rolls on the second day are very hard to get and the fact that two organizations got them was a big surprise.
SDC's Men's A Team was the clear winner of the men’s race, setting a new course record of 2:03.26. Their new buggy, Malice, was painted solid black and was driven by three-time driver Michelle Mirabella, a junior professional writing major and voice minor.
While SDC's Men's A Team placed first, two of SDC’s other men’s teams — B and C — also made it to the finals round with times of 2:08.28 and 2:15.34, respectively.
SDC was the leader in an extremely fast finals round with even the slowest finals team, SigNu A, coming in at 2:16.90.
SDC’s domination was echoed in the women’s races, which happened earlier in the day. Mirabella drove SDC’s Malice to claim the women’s title. Coming in at 2:25.76, the buggy shattered last year’s course record of 2:28.84. 
The top three teams in the women’s races were rounded out with PiKA's Women's A Team's Chimera at 2:31.17 and SigEp Women's A Team's Barracuda at 2:33.89. Chimera was driven by Melissa Lee, a senior biological sciences major, who has been driving for PiKA since her first year at Carnegie Mellon.
“I think that the records’ being broken with such amazing times was definitely surprising to a lot of people,” Williams said.
This year’s races included SAE, who has not raced Buggy since 2003, and Beta, who took a year off last year to push for Fringe's Men's A Team.
Among the older participating organizations, some showed great improvement.
“There were a bunch of teams that all of a sudden had risen out and had good drivers and pushers,” said Dana Weinstein, a sophomore business administration major and driver for Fringe's Women's B and Men's D teams. “Everyone was competing this year and racing for first place.”
SigEp in particular showed great strides. They improved their Men’s A time from 2:15.19 to an impressive 2:08.61, less than a second slower than PiKA's Men's A team, putting them in fifth place. In breaking through the sub-2:10 line, SigEp really showed itself as a Buggy force. It proved itself even more in the women’s race, bettering its A time from 3:10.95 to 2:33.89, giving it its third-place finish. Both teams drove the new blue buggy Barracuda, which placed third in the design competition.
KDR also showed itself quite well. It performed solidly in both the men’s and women’s races, making it to the finals and coming in at seventh and ninth, respectively. Its new bright blue buggy, Polaris, followed in the “P” naming trend of all their buggies and placed second in the design competition.
Fringe took first place in the design competition with Bedlam, its new black-with-blue-stripes buggy.
The rest of the buggy awards included Chairman’s Choice, awarded to AEPi; People’s Design Choice to KDR’s Polaris; Spirit of Buggy to Pioneers; the T-shirt award to Spirit; and King and Queen of the Hill to Spirit A and PiKA A, respectively.
“Getting up at night and going to rolls can be tiring,” Williams said. “But on race day, everything comes together, and it’s well worth it.”
This year’s Buggy competition was the first one that was run with the help of the Carnegie Mellon Buggy Alumni Association, a group started in the summer of 2008 to preserve the history of Buggy, connect with alumni, and further promote undergraduate participation.
The association provided race day guides with pictures of all the buggies and a schedule of events, and invited an alumnus to serve as a commentator on the cmuTV webcast. They plan to continue to work with Alumni Relations as well as reach out to first-years in explaining Buggy and telling them how to get involved.
This year’s competition included 34 buggies. Preparation has already begun for next year.

Scotch’n’Soda’s Spring Carnival performance this year was, in one word, incredible. Me and My Girl is a British musical comedy, complete with laugh-out-loud humor, energetic dances, and a fantastic musical score, and Saturday night, S’n’S managed to pull the whole show together without a glitch.
The plot of the show was fairly simple, and centered on the Hareford family, bringing out the contrast between the British aristocracy and the British commoners. Bill Snibson, played by Scott Wasserman, a junior musical composition major, and Sally Smith, played by Caity Pitts, a first-year musical  composition major, are a happy, very-much-in-love, middle-class couple until Bill finds out that his father was actually the earl of Hareford and Bill, being the sole heir to the entire estate, is the new earl. At this point, we come to a standard situation seen in many stories in which the crass and uncouth commoner appalls and offends his noble relatives in a comedic manner while he attempts to fit in.
To add to the mix, Bill’s relatives all have conflicting opinions about him. Bill’s aunt, Maria, the Duchess of Dene, played by Gillian Hassert, a first-year voice major, has complete faith in Bill and his blue blood, and is convinced that she can stamp out his cockney ways and bring out his nobility. Their close family friend, Sir John Tremayne, played by Steven Das, a junior music and electrical and computer engineering double major, thinks otherwise and continuously tries to dissuade the duchess from encouraging the idea that Bill can ever fit into their world. The duchess’s daughter, Jacqueline, played by Michelle Stewart, a junior biological sciences major, is a seductive vixen out to get Bill’s affections so that she can gain all his wealth in the process.
In the midst of all this confusion, the great divide between the different classes starts taking a toll on Bill and Sally’s relationship. Sally finds herself left out of Bill’s new life, and despite continuous reassurances from Bill, she begins to see the light in the duchess’s words that she and Bill should part ways and decides to break off their relationship for Bill’s own good. But Bill is adamant, convinced that “me and my girl” were made for each other, and as a result, Bill threatens to follow Sally wherever she runs. Empathizing with Sally’s predicament, Tremayne comes up with a brilliant solution. If the duchess wouldn’t accept Sally as she was, Sally would just have to become more refined and ladylike. With humorous references to the musical My Fair Lady, Sally turns from an unruly and loud woman to a sleek and composed lady, and the play ends with a typical “happily ever after.”
Although the plot may not have had much substance or suspense, the acting, dancing, and singing completely overtook any shortcomings that the storyline might have had. The acting was commendable, especially the performance of the leading pair, Wasserman and Pitts. Both were very convincing as a love-struck and later distraught couple, and at the same time were excellent singers and dancers too. They entranced the audience with their tap-dancing and duets, as well as with their sorrowful solo performances.
Hassert was also excellent in her portrayal of the duchess. With a caustic temperament and a streak of humor, Hassert stayed within her character at all times and delivered her lines with great energy. Another performance worth mentioning was Stewart as Jacqueline. Playing a sexy and sassy English lady, Stewart impressed audiences with her clear voice and quick dance moves. Piers Portfolio, a first-year voice major, played the family solicitor, Herbert Parchester, and was a source of much laughter for the audience because of his hilarious antics.
There were also a great many excellent supporting actors that interchanged between different roles — the house help, Bill and Sally’s friends, Bill’s ancestors, the nobles — and they smoothly filled in transitions, as well as performed great song-and-dance numbers, choreographed by Dan Wetzel, a sophomore chemical engineering major. 
The musical score by Matt Aument, a junior musical composition major, was excellent, the highlight being the song “The Lambeth Walk,” a foot-tapping number that got the audience humming along and wishing for an encore. The set design and costumes were elaborately done, making the play resemble its period very effectively. A special mention can be made of the lamp that was set up during Bill’s “Leaning on a Lamppost,” as it was very realistic and set the tone of the stage with its magical yellow light.
On the whole, this was yet another excellent S’n’S production. The show was co-directed by Shannon Deep, a junior humanities and arts major, and Alex DiClaudio, a senior economics major, both of whom did an excellent job getting the cast together and bringing out the energy and hilarity of this play. “The most enjoyable part for me was watching our cast, most of whom did not know each other before, become not only a cohesive team, but also a group of friends,” DiClaudio said.
Scotch’n’Soda’s next performance is* Chugging Scotch*, a 24-hour play festival, on May 2 in McKenna/Peter/Wright in the University Center.

I Love You, Man puts a quirky new spin on the average clichéd chick flick, turning it into a fresh comedy about a man who has everything in the world except a friend to share it with. While most movies about weddings focus on the bride, this movie turns the focus on the groom and his unique struggles before the wedding.
I Love You, Man follows Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd), a real estate agent, who just got engaged to Zooey Rice (Rashida Jones) and suddenly realizes that he doesn’t have anyone special to share the exciting news with. His parents call him a “girlfriend guy,” referring to the fact that his male friends just don’t seem to stick by him for very long. 
After overhearing his fiancée’s friends worry that he won’t have any groomsmen, Peter decides to ask his gay brother Robbie (Andy Samberg) for advice. After a series of unsuccessful “man-dates” (including one that ends in a very awkward tongue kiss), Peter decides to give up on finding a male friend and, consequently, a best man.
But then he finds “love” at an open house at Lou Ferrigno’s in Sydney Fife (Jason Segel). Sydney impresses Peter with his honesty and ability to judge people and they consequently exchange business cards, giving Peter the opportunity for one last man-date. Peter calls Sydney and leaves an embarrassingly bad voice message, but still sets up a date for drinks. It is there where Sydney gets Peter to open up more about himself and his private life.
After a good evening together — and a new nickname for Peter, “Pistol Pete” — Sydney and Peter share another lunch before Sydney brings Peter to his “man cave.” In the “man cave” Peter discovers Sydney’s collection of rock instruments and Rush — a Canadian rock band — paraphernalia and they bond by playing instruments to Rush music. Peter falls in love with “slap[pin] the bass [guitar]” with Sydney, but continues to be uneasy around Sydney and comes up with random nicknames that don’t make sense — including “Totes Magotes.”
It is with Sydney that Peter finds his inner rock star and allows himself to become more free-spirited and loose. Peter then invites Sydney to his engagement party where Sydney finally meets Zooey. Peter later takes Zooey to a Rush concert with Sydney instead of the couple’s tradition of staying at home to watch HBO. At the concert, Zooey realizes that Peter has so much more fun with Sydney and fears that she’s losing him.
Later, Peter goes tuxedo shopping with Sydney and gets convinced to buy a blue suit and get out of his normal boring routine. Sydney also asks Peter to loan him $8000, which Peter does after confiding in Sydney the whole story of finding a male friend and finally asking him to be his best man.
From this point on, as expected, troubles in Peter and Sydney’s and Peter and Zooey’s relationship crop up, creating the required drama in the movie and pulling together the climax.
Overall, I Love You, Man is a heartwarming comedy that explores that true awkwardness of male platonic relationships. Segel fits his place as the outrageous but ever-so-loving best man and Rudd perfects his role as an uptight but child-at-heart groom.
Peter and Sydney make quite the duo in this hilarious comedy. Their vulgar jokes combined with their love for one another provide a light-hearted, endearing movie for anyone’s enjoyment.

You’d think it would be impossible to make it big with a band name like that. And yet The New Pornographers, an exuberant Canadian rock band, have done just that. 
Their mix of pop songwriting and punkish energy has won over critics in mainstream and alternative music circles alike. They have reached commercial success too, touring everywhere from the nearby states within the U.S. to faraway Australia. On Friday night, the group gave its first performance of 2009 at Carnegie Mellon.  
The CFA lawn was packed with students and energy as the group took the stage. They’re a band that, at first glance, is unassuming; they dress in not-that-skinny jeans and modest-toned collared shirts. Lead singer, guitarist, and principal songwriter Carl Newman speaks — and sings — with a thick lisp. Kurt Dahle, the group’s ferocious drummer, glugs beer and smokes as he plays. You’d think this is a pretty ragtag bunch, but there’s plenty of polish underneath the shaggy first impression. 
Newman tightly structures his music around vocal melodies, using drums and guitars as rhythmic ammunition to support his songwriting. On “My Rights Versus Yours,” the opening number of the show, Newman exercised a fierce howl, where he imagined a “new empire in rags.”  
This is the first single off of Challengers, the group’s 2007 release. Though the tune’s energy and imagery are provocative, the album as a whole lacked the precision in songwriting and originality that the group had been lauded for in the past. In fact, it was 2005’s Twin Cinema where Newman flexed his mastery in composition and the ability to build a group dynamic around his music.  
It’s no surprise, therefore, that most of the concert on Friday night was devoted to music from this release — much to the pleasure of the crowd. “Use It,” one of the first tunes of the evening, is a lightning bolt of energy. The hook goes like this: “If you’ve got something that sheds some light, use it tonight.”  
It’s a mantra that Newman sticks to himself. His musical strength lies in the ability to stretch and challenge the expected duration of the “pop” song, which is now decades — if not centuries — old. 
Though most of his tunes only have a couple of minutes’ worth of strong melodic material, Newman uses his powerhouse group of musicians to yank out all of the potential energy and life that each tune holds. “Stacked Crooked,” from Twin Cinema, opened with easy guitar strums and cymbal splashes that tread into a subdued vocal phrase. There’s a continuous momentum build that takes over four minutes to reach fruition. There’s a couple of verses and choruses — standard form for a pop tune — that get louder, faster, and heavier with each pass. By the last pass of the chorus, there’s a drumbeat so fast and raucous, you’d think the group had started a different tune altogether. 
Patience and pacing, therefore, are important concepts in the group’s music, and there were plenty of both at Friday night’s performance. “The Bleeding Heart Show,” much like “Stacked Crooked,” began with a rubato — an adjustment in tempo — figure from guitarist Todd Fancey and Newman himself. 
There was over a minute of singing and guitar playing before any other instruments came in. Even after the drums, bass, and keyboards entered, the angular melody of the verse still persisted. It was not until the two-minute mark that the “ooh ooh” refrain entered. Then, the tune exploded into the line, “We have arrived!” By the end, the song was almost five minutes in length — a long way from the two-minute anthems of Chuck Berry and the Beatles.  
The group delivers such a strong balance of arranging and composition that the democratic process of constructing a song is integral. Newman writes most of the melodies and gives the band free rein to design parts around them. 
“A lot of times [Newman] and I will play, just the two of us” to get the parts right, said Dahle backstage after the show. “Sometimes he’ll say, ‘Yeah, do that beat you just tried,’ but a lot of times I just make the parts myself.” 
Though Twin Cinema was the focal point of the evening, the New Pornographers made sure its older fans didn’t go home disappointed. The group plummeted into “Electric Version,” a recklessly joyful tune from their 2003 album of the same name. Polish may be a defining concept in the more commercially successful portion of the group’s output, but here it’s unnecessary; the unpredictability of the drum pounding and guitar thwacks keep you listening.  
It’s this attitude of rough-around-the-edges that made the opening band, Ted Leo & The Pharmacists, so entertaining. Leo — who, like his bandmates, hails from New Jersey — doesn’t have the soaring vocal capabilities of Newman, nor do his songs flex the same meticulousness, but what the Pharmacists lacks in mainstream configuration they make up for in energy, stage presence, and an old-fashioned sense of punk rock testosterone.  
Still, the spotlight was on the New Pornographers. In their last few tunes, they made sure to deal out their strongest cards. “Sing Me Spanish Techno” is a cheery, relatable tune that confesses to “listening too long to one song.” The final song of the set is an old tune entitled “My Slow Descent Into Alcoholism,” an appropriate tune about college life. 
The audience was elated to have one of the finest bands at Carnegie Mellon to celebrate, and when Newman approached the microphone and asked, “Is school almost over?” everyone gave a billowing cheer. 
There are still a couple of weeks of classes left, and the always-crippling finals period lurks in the shadows, but the vigilance of the crowd and the spirit of the moment makes it feel like the end is just days away.

Last Thursday, in the midst of yet another thrilling Carnegie Mellon Carnival, AB Comedy showcased a man who has reached a new level of comedic genius in today’s world: Zach Galifianakis. But before talking about the show itself, let’s talk a little bit about the man behind the beard.
Galifianakis, 40, has been acting in films and television shows for the last decade, including a leading role in the upcoming film The Hangover, in which he plays one of three groomsmen who wake up in a Las Vegas hotel room with no memory of the previous night and a missing groom. The trailer of the movie was played before he took the stage Thursday night to raucous applause from the audience.
Galifianakis was born in Wilkesboro, N.C., where he remained through his college days at North Carolina State University pursuing a degree in communication and film. In 1992, he left for New York City, where he still resides in a “hip” section of Brooklyn, a place that he asserts would not enjoy his new catchphrase: “Look everyone, here comes the Choo-Choo!” After toiling in the dregs of NYC for four years, Galifianakis got his big break on a short-lived sitcom called Boston Common, and in 2001 appeared in three mainstream movies and one smaller film in which he had a leading role. Since then, he’s also had roles in the Academy Award-nominated Into the Wild and What Happens in Vegas, as well as the upcoming films G-Force and Youth in Revolt. Galifianakis also splits his time between two other residences, one in Venice Beach, Calif. and the other, a 60-acre farm in North Carolina, that he hopes to someday turn into a “writer’s retreat.”
But most of Galifianakis’ notoriety came from his performance on an episode of Comedy Central Presents that first aired in Sept. 2001 in which he did stand-up, played the piano, danced, and lip-synched while making jokes with a pad of paper. Stand-up has been his calling in life. He combines elements of absurdity, not-so-subtle one-liners, political incorrectness, and much more to make his act an absolute laugh riot. While some of his jokes contain somewhat obscure references, he’s one of few comedians today who still assume his audiences are smart enough to just get his jokes and move on. He doesn’t linger on the hits or the misses, but breezes through his act, delivering punch line after punch line, with nearly all of them hitting right on the mark.
The little charades mentioned earlier from his first on-air special are still incorporated into his act to this day, and last Thursday was no different. After a short delay, AB Comedy chairman Danny Schoenfelder, a senior civil and environmental engineering major, went on stage to plug the AB elections and introduce the man of the hour. 
Beginning with some of his quality stand-up, including a slight ribbing of Carnegie Mellon’s most phallic landmark and all the hallmarks that come with performing at a carnival, Galifianakis got into a nice groove with the crowd before moving to his piano to play some quality tunes. He delivered some of his best one-liners, like why he plays the opening riff to “Turning Japanese” whenever his Asian roommate entered the room — because he doesn’t have a gong, of course. Later, Galifianakis “freestyled” while getting to know the audience a little. He made fun of a few people’s inability to elaborate on any question asked of them.
Before his finale, Galifianakis did some more stand-up and played a little more piano, and also delivered one of his best jokes of the night. For the grand finale, Galifianakis talked about how newly elected president Obama made him feel he could change to be a better person in life, so he changed into a neon-lit jumpsuit and started tearing jokes off of a large notepad as a video montage played multiples of him lip-synching to the tune of Michael Jackson’s “Man in the Mirror.” It was truly a sight to behold.
After the show, Galifianakis was kind enough to share his thoughts on the realm of comedy and how he gets the ideas for his own brand.
“Some people, their minds work mathematically, some socially, and others’ minds work dramatically,” he said. “And some people just have this thing in them where they have comedy in this part of their brain. And if you nurture that, then it just comes from you, but you need people in your background to make it all happen.” This just goes to show you that people with the “professor on meth” and “vice president of ultimate Frisbee” look may be more than their beards make them out to be.
Galifianakis is currently touring the country doing stand-up in pubs and on college campuses with statues walking upward from Nowheresville, Pa. to Bigtimetown, Calif. To find out where he’ll be next, go online to zachgalifianakis.com.

There’s something about greasy carbohydrates that draws everyone to them, from fast food like Kentucky Fried Chicken to gourmet delicacies like Vodka Tempura batter by Chef Nobu Matsuhisa — yes, they use vodka instead of water because the high alcohol content generates no steam when the tempuras are fried.
But at Carnegie Mellon University’s Spring Carnival 2009, there’s nothing complicated or fancy about funnel cakes and fried Oreos, as they are simple, straightforward, and delicious.
Every year during Carnival, the brothers (and sisters) of Alpha Phi Omega build the concession booth, selling carnival staples like funnel cake, nachos, hot dogs, and deep-fried Oreos. Students campus-wide look forward to Carnival, not only for Booth and Buggy, but also for some funnel cake.
“I can feel my arteries clogging, but these fried Oreos are so delicious,” said Christine Chen, a sophomore psychology major who served up fried Oreos and funnel cake from the frying station in Alpha Phi Omega booth. For those who are not familiar with them, fried Oreos are Oreos dipped in funnel cake batter and deep fried at 400ºF until golden brown.
Funnel cake batter is made from funnel cake mix, stacked up high in the back of the booth, combined with water in an industrial-size electric mixer. The batter is made throughout the day as the funnel cakes are prepared so that no excess batter is left behind.
The kitchen also has a restaurant-quality electric mixer, three professional shallow fryers for the funnel cake, one deep fryer for the fried Oreos, two ovens — one for soft pretzels and one for pizza — a pretzel heater, a pizza warmer, and four to five steamers for hot dogs, buns, hot sausages, and cheese sauce, in addition to a popcorn machine, three coffee heaters, three registers, and three beverage fridges. At the back of the booth, there’s a running tap with a sink for cleaning, and the brothers install all the electric wire that runs through the booth.
Aside from large appliances, there are stacks of paper plates, napkins, foam cups, and kitchen utensils like tongs and strainers. There’s a three-speaker sound system and a radio for entertainment. This is a serious mobile kitchen.
For a closed space with four fryers, the air inside the concession stand is not as stuffy as expected. With the two register openings and exits, there is plenty of room for air circulation. On one side of the booth, where all the fryers are stationed, it tends to get warmer and more humid as the water from the batter evaporates, but as lovely as the sunny weather is outside, it is rather nice that this kitchen is under a roof, protecting the chefs from sunburns.
Ellen Tworkoski, a sophomore materials science and engineering major, said that Alpha Phi Omega “owns everything in the kitchen, except for the beverage fridges that Pepsi lends them.” Apart from selling funnel cake and fried Oreos at Carnival, Alpha Phi Omega also sells them at university football games throughout the year.
For some brothers of Alpha Phi Omega, the day starts at 8 a.m. They have to come and open the booth, prepare the batter, and fill the fridge with drinks to start selling at 10 a.m. and continue non-stop until 11 p.m.
Earlier in the day, when there isn’t a long line of customers waiting, each funnel cake is fried to order. Around one o’clock, with more people walking around the Carnival, the line grows longer and all three shallow fryers are working at the same time, each of them frying two funnel cakes simultaneously while the deep fryer constantly fries Oreos.
Each funnel cake is unique. Aside from its circular shape, the texture and the color of the funnel cake depends on the batter and the person who cooks them. The thickness of the batter differs depending on the funnels used. The lighter the batter, the thinner each swirl is, and the cake ends up crisper. Thicker batter means thicker swirls with a softer, more cake-like texture inside the crisp surface. Some cakes take on a pale gold color while the other might become a deep golden brown. As Michael Klipper, a graduate student in mathematical sciences, who guarded the register on Friday morning, said, “You have to appreciate the swirl of funnel cake.”
Last year, a little girl who attended Carnival asked for an ice cream, and began to cry when she found out that Alpha Phi Omega did not have any ice cream for sale. Today, they sell ice cream, too.
One of the strangest orders they have ever received is for a “slightly uncooked” funnel cake — a funnel cake that just starts to set in the fryer and doesn’t catch on any color yet, tasting slightly like cake dough.
With soundtracks from Jason Mraz, Cobie Caillat, and Coldplay in the background, the mood in the booth was quite relaxed. Instead of running around like headless chickens trying to get everything in order, the brothers are unexpectedly calm, even dancing along with Coldplay’s “Viva La Vida” while serving up delicious, fun food.

Carnival is a time for Carnegie Mellon students to leave their books in their rooms and enjoy a four-day weekend filled with oddly coincidental sunny weather. However, students were not the only ones seen enjoying Carnival. A glimpse of Midway last weekend would show young and old walking around, examining the booths, playing the different games, and going on the many different rides. The booths were quite a hit with local Pittsburghers. A young girl from Pittsburgh, Lavendar Woolstrum, mentioned, “The Siege on PhiKap Castle is the best booth.” Woolstrum seemed to be having a lot of fun as she kept flitting from one booth to the next while her parents looked on. 
Carnival provides an opportunity for schoolgirls like Woolstrum to experience a Carnegie Mellon tradition. But apart from children, elderly couples also find this event entertaining; many of them were spotted strolling around leisurely and enjoying the good weather. High school students, with their respective groups of friends, could also be seen exploring the booths and enjoying the extreme rides. Families with young children were utilizing Carnival as a way to spend some time. Each family member had great fun pulling the others along to his or her favorite part of Carnival.
Woolstrum seemed to want to go all over the place, and her family tagged along with her wherever she wanted to explore. Many others also had the same idea as Woolstrum and were exploring the Carnival as much as they could, while others were leisurely walking around and taking their time to see only what they were interested in.
Carnival was a huge hit not only among Carnegie Mellon students, but also among locals who are a part of the Pittsburgh community. This four-day weekend proved to be a de-stresser for everyone who could take a night off and just go out and enjoy Carnival.

Rent is not your average musical, at least not in the sense that the word “musical” typically implies. While there were costumes, the clothes were ones that you would expect to see on someone stuck in the ’90s. The orchestra for the show was placed on the stage for the whole performance, and the main instruments that could be heard throughout the songs were the electric guitar and drums — definitely not typical for a musical score. And yet the energy on stage — and in the audience — was palpable. The cheering frenzy began as soon as the first cast member stepped on stage, before any words were either sung or spoken.
Rent follows the stories of a group of friends whose lives are completely intertwined. There’s Mark (Anthony Rapp), the filmmaker, who is friends with Roger (Adam Pascal), the songwriter and ex-drug addict, who dates Mimi (Lexi Lawson), a dancer and sometimes addict, who dated Benny (Jacques C. Smith), who was friends with Mark and Roger but then married a society woman and bought the land they live on. Maureen, played on Tuesday by understudy Caren Tackett, who used to date Mark, broke up with him to date Joanne (Trisha Jeffrey), a perfectionist lawyer. Collins (Michael McElroy), who is another of Mark and Roger’s friends, is in love with the cross-dressing Angel (Justin Johnston).
The plot of the show, however, was not written to cover the sometimes-superficial stories that musicals tend to follow. Rent was written to discuss real issues — every character in the show is in some way affected by AIDS, and the story follows a year in the lives of these friends to show the impact that the disease can — and does — have. And yet you don’t feel like you’re being preached at. Each and every cast member is into the show as much as the audience is, and you feel like you’re watching snippets of real people’s lives.
The enthusiasm of the cast members is vital to the believability of their characters, and the actors and actresses did not disappoint. Many of them have been in previous productions of Rent — as part of the original Broadway cast and the movie version of the show, like Pascal, Rapp, and Gwen Stewart, who played the bag lady and soloist in “Seasons of Love,” or as part of the replacement Broadway cast — and they were able to effortlessly slip back into their characters. Their passion and emotion was something that couldn’t be faked, and it helped draw the audience into the performance.
“The great thing about touring is that you get to see how much [the show] means to people, and how they value and appreciate it. Seeing how much it means to people makes it an honor,” commented McElroy, a Carnegie Mellon alum.
While there was certainly chemistry among all the cast members, that between Rapp and Pascal could not be ignored. After working together on Rent multiple times, the two seemed completely at ease with each other on stage, simply two friends talking — or singing — to each other. The chemistry was also apparent between McElroy and Johnston. The two acted together flawlessly, showing just the right amount of emotion without making the role cheesy, and also blended together perfectly on their songs.
“[Johnston] was my favorite person to act with, since our storylines had us together the most. We had a great camaraderie,” said McElroy.
The way the stage was set up for the show was something that is not usually seen in musicals, but worked perfectly with the style of the show. The orchestra was completely on the stage, more or less hidden but not in the respect that the audience couldn’t see them. The scenery on stage never changed, and the changing locations and orientation of small props like tables and chairs, along with the moving around that the actors and actresses did, dictated where the scene was taking place — but it worked perfectly for the show, keeping with the bohemian vibe. The music fit with the vibe as well: the more rock-based songs perfectly portray the story. The music flows right into the dialogue without seeming out of place or unnecessary — every song says exactly what it’s supposed to.
While Rent is certainly not a newcomer to the stage, a touring production is always different from a Broadway production or the film version. McElroy, who also performed his role on Broadway, discussed the differences of touring.
“When you’re touring, you get to see lots of the country, and it brings together a great group of people, a culmination of people from many different performances of the show,” he said.
The tour also allowed the audience to see that the show is more than just a show to the cast members — they haven’t forgotten what the show is about, that it is a cause, and not just a story. On Tuesday night, the cast auctioned off the chance to be backstage for a performance of the show, and the proceeds for the auction would be given toward AIDS awareness. In addition, autographed Playbills and posters were on sale after the show, as they were in every city, and proceeds from those sales went to AIDS awareness as well.
Though Rent may not be a traditional musical, there is no questioning that the show was a hit, and that the audience was able to connect to the show and the characters.

Theater is not always about entertainment. The legendary German writer Bertolt Brecht, known for his provocative plays, operas, and poems, strongly believed in the power of theater to produce social change and did not want his audiences to attend his works for sheer entertainment. The School of Drama production Tough Nut Cabaret is a tremendous blend of well-known and lesser-known poems and songs by this famous writer and social critic. Tough Nut Cabaret, devised and directed by Robyn Archer, will run through April 25 in the intimate Helen Wayne Rauh Studio Theater inside the Purnell Center for the Arts. The production is part of Carnegie Mellon’s Bite of Brecht festival that celebrates the excellence of Brecht and his pivotal works.
Bertolt Brecht lived a life of criticism and exile while he served as a medical orderly in World War I and survived Nazism in World War II. In the 1930s, Brecht’s German citizenship was taken away due to the Nazis’ anxiety over the communist messages in his works. Fleeing to the U.S. in ’47, Brecht was forced to confront Joseph McCarthy, a U.S. Senator, on charges of communism. Released by McCarthy without conviction, Brecht did not feel welcome in America either and decided to return to Europe in 1948 before finally returning to Berlin in 1949. Brecht died in 1956, and assistant dramaturgs and first-year drama majors Mary Margaret Kunze and Alexander Miller noted that, during that time he was “under a banner of controversy which he would have undoubtedly delighted in. His work has been outlawed and slandered and celebrated, much like the man himself.” 
Tough Nut Cabaret features Brecht’s lesser-known poetry, which Archer describes as “dry, succinct, packed with twists and turns on the ethical and observational axis; they bristle with the touchstones of his particular take on humanity — that there is good in the bad [and] bad in the good.” The format of this show is challenging and rewarding for the actors, as it often depends on their ability to express the Brecht poems and songs within a span of a few minutes. Only a single actor of a very capable and convincing cast, Tristan Farmer, a senior drama major, delivered his poetic monologues with ease and subtlety. Roberta Burke, a senior drama major who often delivered critical and harsh opinions on love and lust, was a powerful presence on the stage, grabbing the audience’s attention with her strong and forceful entrance. The meaningful acting in this cabaret only clarifies its messages about what it means to be human.
The cabaret does not follow a consistent story, but is, rather, a larger commentary on humanity, its successes, and its flaws. One scene that profoundly refuses to be ignored comes from Brecht’s poem, “The Late Lamented Fame of the Giant City of New York.” In this full ensemble piece, the actors follow the success of New York in the booming ’20s before hitting rock bottom when the stock market crashed in October 1929. In the beginning of the poem, the lights behind the actors in the smoky and compact Rauh Theater increasingly brighten, before dimming and extinguishing after the description of life during and after the Wall Street crash. Brecht utilizes this poem to demonstrate how even large communal life in New York can ultimately fall victim to the same flaws that can be apparent in a single human being.
Brecht was influenced by and aware of his audience. As dramaturg Brianna Allen, a senior creative enterprise management and drama double major, remarked, “In order to make his audience think, [Brecht] used techniques of alienation or ... Verfremdungseffekt ... ‘to make strange.’” Allen goes on to explain that this form allows the audience to recognize a situation because it is realistic while, at the same time, there is something in the scene that seems out of place, “allow[ing] [the audience] to explore and question topics they had not thought about before.” This Brecht technique was made clear in a sequence where actor Will Brill, a senior drama major, acts out the story of a drunkard who lives on city benches until he sees the light of God and decides to mend his ways. Brill effectively expresses the poem with humor and confusion, a clear case of Verfremdungseffekt. The actors do a tremendous job in this challenging cabaret setting, while Crystal Lee, a graduate student in drama, uses fiery and smoky lighting design to set a dramatic scene that lends itself to soul searching. Gerry Dantry, a drama accompanist, does a terrific job on an upright piano, often having to play stylistic Kurt Weill themes. At times, the woodwinds of the band overplayed and made it difficult to understand what a solo singer was enunciating, but the choreography of the ensemble when singing and talking was effective and unified.
Tough Nut Cabaret is a show of human tendencies and hope. As repeated in Brecht’s powerful poem, “Everything Changes”: “You can make a fresh start with your last breath.” Theater may not only be for entertainment, but Brecht, along with Archer’s direction and Carnegie Mellon’s talented actors, manages to artistically entertain while provoking thought and interpretation.
The show continues to run April 16-24 at 8 p.m., at the Rauh Studio Theater in the Purnell Center of the Arts.

Amid all of the games and excitement, Mustache Required took the side stage at this year’s Carnival. Mustache Required is a two-member hip-hop/punk/pop band from Pittsburgh. During the performance, the lead singer, MC Mystery, wore a Girl Talk t-shirt and superhero glasses. The band ran into some technical difficulties when the singer couldn’t hear his own music from the stage, but then everything came together and the show became enjoyable.
“When I heat up a Pop Tart, I eat it with cereal,” was the classic line MC Mystery used to open his first song. His music was basically a mix of rapping and talking. He performed a song entitled “Test Wall,” which got a great reaction from the audience, although the audience was only 20 people at the time.
Some might find parts of the performance and content of the band’s music funny and others may find it offensive. MC Mystery displayed his wild streak when he sang a song about wanting to kiss a guy. He jumped into the audience and sat on the lap of — no, straddled — two male audience members and pretended to kiss them.
What took the cake in terms of controversy was the song “Pizza by the Slice,” in which MC Mystery sang about an 11-year-old getting an abortion because he thinks abortions are hilarious. These are all jokes, but the content of the songs was definitely shocking.
MC Mystery offered the audience the choice of hearing about sexual obscenity or 9/11, and the audience, consisting of mostly teenagers by this time, chose sexual obscenity. He advised the listeners to do some pretty intense sexual activities and then “smack a ho.”
After his wild stunt of jumping into the audience, flailing arms, and knocking over chairs, pretty much the entire audience had had enough and decided to leave. Clearly, the band did not get a great response. Mustache Required released Bottom Half Swimmer this January. The CD may be better entertainment than the live concert since it is just music and no performance.
On a brighter note, the next performance was entertaining from the start. Inside the tent, surrounded by people, was a man in gold sneakers and gold tights walking around the crowd, banging a tambourine. Another man, wearing a cape and a helmet, was standing on stage holding a microphone. The guitarist was in a dress, the drummer was wearing a bowtie with no shirt, and the bass guitarist wore a Fred Flintstone outfit with a thick black mustache and muscle sleeves — and that’s not all — the man on the bongos wore a pajama suit with slippers and a matching hat. These are the members of The Hood Gang.
The band calls itself the “undisputed No. 1 Most Partyingest Band” on its MySpace page. Needless to say, the band gives off the air of being able to easily entertain. The progressive/glam/crunk band from Pittsburgh, no doubt, was prepared to show the audience why they were the “most partyingest band” in Pittsburgh.
The music was pretty thrilling and the performance was very exciting. Although there was some jumping into the audience and rolling on the floor, none of the audience members were seen getting up and running away from the performance. In fact, the more they performed, the more of an audience they drew in. Bystanders and carnival-goers stopped to listen to music and look at the show. The performance was more of an engaging one, but it did not last very long. The band played for 20 minutes and then the performance was over.
The crowd was clearly entertained and wanted more, but the band was finished. The band did start back up after stopping three times though, tricking the audience into thinking they were going to continue their performance, only to be fooled by the cessation of the music.
The Hood Gang appeared to be a hit with the crowd as audience members walked away singing “partaayyyy, parrttaayyyy,” a line from one of the band’s songs.

“Kree-sten! Kree-stenn!” I heard the yelling and groggily forced myself out of bed. Opening the door, Florence announced, “*Il est deux heures et demi.*”
Huh? I thought. She repeated, “*deux heures et demi.*” Seeing me still looking confused, she slowly explained, “two thirty.” Finally my mind started to put it together and slight panic hit me. Right, I thought while collecting myself, I’m in France and it is 2:30? Oh great, that means I just slept for 18 hours. Not exactly how I had hoped to start my first day studying abroad.
In my mind, it was never a question about whether I would study abroad in France; it was only a question of when. So when I started to consider how I should spend the summer after my first year at college, studying in France seemed like a natural choice. I did the research and settled on a program in Avignon, a pretty large town on the Rhone River in the south of France. I would spend six weeks there studying theater at the turn of the 20th century and the architecture and archaeology of the south of France. Then I planned to head north to Paris to spend a week on vacation with my mother. 
I was incredibly excited to go, but as my departure date approached, I realized how nervous I was, too. I would be going thousands of miles away to live with a family that I had never met and live in a city that didn’t speak English. Being rational, I knew I was a strong enough French speaker to get by and the program wouldn’t place me in a house with crazy people, but the whole thing still seemed intimidating.
After my late start on my first day, I finally collected myself. Florence — my host mother — and I headed into the city. While crossing the bridge over the Rhone, I realized Avignon was beautiful. In the south of France, the sky is always a crisp blue and the rock walls that surround the old city are striking against this background. We drove past Avignon’s famous bridge, parked the car, and walked up the main road toward the medieval papal palace. The square in front of the palace was the most beautiful scene yet. Café umbrellas dotted the cobblestone courtyard with the palace and church in the background. I couldn’t believe I would be spending the next six weeks here.
As amazed as I was with my new surroundings, I was still intimidated. I found trying to communicate in another language all day exhausting. My brain actually felt tired at the end of the day. There were so many new things to learn. I memorized the path to my school and then spent lunches wandering around trying to figure out where everything was. Unlike the gridded cities I was used to, Avignon had streets that crisscrossed throughout the whole city; due to my lack of a good sense of direction, I got lost consistently.
But soon, getting lost became infrequent, and I realized that a lot of things weren’t too different. I easily understood the bus system, which worked the same as in Pittsburgh. I found great sandwich and crepe stands for lunch. My classes fell into step, too. We read plays weekly for my theater class and had history lessons for the other. Then we would go on field trips and see the places we learned about. I really felt as though I was starting to absorb what was going on around me.
Time passed quickly and before I knew it, I was getting ready to head north. I had learned a lot during my stay and had made amazing new friends. I would miss spending time in cafés with them and discovering new parts of the city. I knew the part I would miss the most, however, was dinnertime.
My favorite part of the day was always dinner. Each night Florence and Michel — my host father — and I would set the table outside and eat together. Sometimes, one of their three sons would stop by with his girlfriend as well. Dinner was eaten in courses and always included desert. 
The food wasn’t drastically different than what I would eat at home, but it wasn’t the same either. I found that I loved radishes and couldn’t get enough quiche. During dinner, we would sit and talk about anything and everything, from the weather to sports to how French people reacted to the euro to the teacher strikes in Paris. I enjoyed hearing their opinions on everything and realizing how alike and different our lives were.
While I’ve learned a lot about France in the classroom, living there was a whole new story. French people are consistently stereotyped in the U.S. in many ways. We all hear the grumbles of the smelly French people who hate Americans. Or maybe we picture the chic Parisian who spends all her time in a café drinking black coffee and smoking cigarettes. 
Whatever image of France I could have possibly had in my head, “Avignonites” did not fit it. People there had an almost hippie vibe that is known locally as “baba-cool.” Lots of young people wore their hair in dreadlocks. The community included many immigrants from North Africa and had a strong Arabic influence. 
Some things, of course, did fit my expectations. We watched soccer, played pétanque, and ate ratatouille. But, in the end, I had discovered that to really know a place was to meet the people.

At last, Carnival kicks off with a bang as it unofficially marks the start to the end of the semester. The weather, which is unusually consecutively sunny, the booths — just as exciting as the year before — and the assortment of Carnival food — fried Oreos, anyone? — provides Carnegie Mellon students with a much-needed and enjoyable break from work overload and sleep deficit.
There is always so much excitement surrounding Carnival that it is inevitably reflected in the fresh wardrobes of the students and the event’s attendees. Spring echoes a new start with many breaking out of drab library-chic wear and embracing easy-going, comfortable, bright pieces.
Jonnelle Saunders, a sophomore science and humanities scholar, immediately catches the eye with her ultra-feminine yellow frock, the ruffles of which are downplayed by a structured white blazer, pulling together a fantastic summery piece. The colors complement her skin tone, and the rest of her look isn’t unnecessarily cluttered.
All regular fashion magazine readers have had the next big look ingrained into their heads for many months now — the jumpsuit is purported to be a great in-between piece, wedged between the sleek dress and slim suit categories. It comes in all varieties, from slick silk to utilitarian thick jersey to playful floral, and advocates boast its surprising wearability and the wonders it can do for the silhouette. While the trend has been somewhat slow to catch on, a Carnival attendee, Camly Tran, a senior chemistry major, stepped into the festivities with an adorable variation of the jumpsuit. A floral print is splashed against a white canvas, and its springy material and shorts make it exceptionally appropriate for daywear.
A popular piece last summer, the maxi dress seems to have finally found a place in women’s closets as a classic piece that’s easy to throw on and even easier to accessorize. Amun Bashir, a senior business major, shows one off in electric blue that is perfectly flowing. To keep the elegance of the dress, Bashir accessorizes with only a long, simple necklace and strappy sandals, basic pieces that are great to keep around.
From comedy shows to indie concerts, there are countless activities in which to partake during Carnival — and, just as excitingly, there are so many great opportunities to dress for a whole array of occasions. With Carnival marking the countdown to the end of the school year, celebrate by indulging in spring and all the new trends it has to offer.

Indie rock group Peter Bjorn and John’s whistle-heavy “Young Folks” track is primarily the reason why people started listening to the band. It makes sense: An easy rhythmic beat sparkled with an addictive whistle section felt just right for the summer of 2006. 
While no one had ever heard of the band before, “Young Folks” was a track from its third album, Writer’s Block. Now, PB&J are back with their fourth album. Titled Living Thing, the album attempts to reach the masses with a new sound by replacing the band’s previously frequent guitar sprawls with electronic beats and sounds instead.
Electric claps and bass spread throughout the aptly-titled first track, “The Feeling,” as the new feeling of these new tracks is incredibly different from the previous three albums. It feels as if the guitar has taken a complete backseat to these synthesizers and other electronic instruments. 
Some would consider this new album a compliment to Kanye West’s release of 808s and Heartbreak, as they heavily depend on synthesizers. 
However, this move could also be considered markedly different. West decided to try a completely different genre, while PB&J are seemingly making a bigger step in the ultimate direction of their career. Their hipster-like status is more attuned to Radiohead’s The Bends release, which brought Radiohead into a completely different direction than their previous “Creep” status.
While it would seem that PB&J’s release of this synthesizer-heavy fourth album is closer to The Bends than 808s and Heartbreak, Living Thing is as good as either album. 
Synthesizer-heavy albums like 808s and Heartbreak and PB&J’s Living Thing require lyrics that are both interesting and catchy. While 808s flashed moments of beauty and simplicity in West’s singing debut, PB&J simply put very few beautiful or deep lyrics within the album. 
Living Thing is a barren wasteland lyrically as it sings with heavy strokes of vague imagery that never quite desire the listener to project or think hard. It feels as if the band wasn’t able to come up with anything else to sing about, so lines and phrases are endlessly repeated throughout the entire album.
PB&J has an album that features some decent tracks, but around these tracks are dull pieces of electronic music with uninteresting lyrics that simply bore the listener. 
“Lay It Down” is a catchy track that features an awkward mix of catchy music. The title track is the best upbeat song on the entire album, as it features a memorable chorus and interesting soundscape of plucking guitars, snare drum, and some background synthesizer work. 
While “Living Thing” is a great track, the slower “4 out of 5” is the true gem of the album. Both the singer and the synthesizers work in tandem to create the type of song that this style of music demands. A lazy-sounding singer backed by repeating fuzzy guitar plucks and a nice and sparse beat offer up a hazy four minutes of heaven as the second to last track on the album.
PB&J may have hit the big time with their song “Young Folks,” but the band fumbled its moment in the spotlight by offering up an album that doesn’t quite lyrically and musically hold the listeners’ attention. 
While Living Thing seemed to follow the trend of many of the big names in the music world by adapting more electronic instruments to their typical sound, a la West and Radiohead, PB&J does not attempt to change its way of creating record as both West and Radiohead had done with 808s and The Bends. 
While there are some very good songs on Living Thing, Peter Bjorn and John’s fourth album is a dud, which will hopefully make the band realize that simply changing instruments without changing its approach to making music does not quite work. At least Living Thing won’t be as bad as this summer’s release of Lil Wayne’s rock album, although that isn’t saying too much.

What is your favorite part of Carnival?
Boooooth! —AY
NO SCHOOL! —CM
Deep-fried Oreos. —HT
FERRIS WHEEEEEEL! —HS
How do you think this year’s theme compared to last year’s theme of “Extra! Extra! Read all about it!”?
Much better! A lot of the groups did some really creative things this year, from board games to books to adaptations. —AY
I think this year’s theme somehow motivated people to be more innovative with the booths. —HS
“Epic Adventures” is much more Carnegie Mellon then last year’s theme. —KS
Which booth was a “true adventure”? Which one was just didn’t live up?
POKÉMON all the way, although I’m Asian. —CM
Sig Tau’s Tron booth was a snore, but AEPi’s Wall-E booth was incredible. —DM
As for the true adventure, I’d be torn between the PokéBooth and the Goonies one. —HS
Back to the Future. —KS
Which is cooler: Mobot or Buggy?
Buggy is less nerdy compared to Mobot, therefore it’s cooler? —CM
Buggy! Hands down. —HT
Without a doubt, the mobots —DM
Hmm. I don’t know. Both are oh-so-very-Carnegie Mellon. —HS
Would you rather be squished into a buggy and be pushed down a hill or eat three funnel cakes without a break?
Definitely pushed in a buggy! It would be pretty intense, but I’d really love to learn how to steer one of those. Also, their names are all wicked cool. Malice! Firebird! —AY
You can never, ever have enough funnel cake. —HT
Be squished into a buggy. —HS
Buggy... there’s less of a chance I’ll throw up. —YL
Three funnel cakes, of course. —CL
Did anything funny happen to you over Carnival?
My biceps started aching from cooking so much funnel cake and fried Oreos. —AY
Nothing particular this year, but last year I saw fried Oreos for the first time in my life. I thought those were pretty funny. WHY would anyone want to do that? WHY? WHY? WHY?!?! I couldn’t stop asking. —HS
My face was dyed purple all of Saturday. I got stopped and asked if I would mind having my picture taken. —KS
What are you going to do now that Carnival weekend has passed?
Finishing a project, doing my homework, studying for my exam. Do I have choice? —CM
Editing. Lots and lots of editing. —DM
Write papers. Give presentations. Then write some more papers. —HS
Study... because we’re at Carnegie Mellon and that’s all I do anymore. —YL

Red Bull might not have existed 50 years ago, but it might as well have. An advertisement for NoDoz awakeners shows a caffeinated fox, “bright eyed and bushy tailed,” looking prepared to write a 50-page paper overnight. Lauded for being as “safe as coffee,” NoDoz tablets offer a perfect way to stay awake during the next Glen Miller concert your girlfriend drags you to.

Carnegie Mellon will be hosting a national fencing tournament at the main gym. Over five Carnegie Mellon students have qualified for the tournament, which covers Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, and New Jersey. As part of the celebration, fencers have taken the Fence. For the façade, fencers fenced the Fence. After fencing the Fence, fencers faced felony for fouling the Fence.

Plans are being made to build a new residence hall in the grassy area between Donner, Margaret Morrison, and Resnik. While nothing has been finalized yet, it is projected that building will begin in January 2000 and end sometime around June 2001. “There is nothing set in stone yet,” says a first-year student who happens to be in the Student Dormitory Council and Student Life Committee. The residence was never actually constructed, but SDC claims it wasn’t their fault, as they finished their macaroni and glue plate building miniatures well before their deadline.

In the “Crime and Incident” section, an unknown male attacks Buggy participants on the Frew Street race track. After realizing that the person was not a student, the perpetrator was escorted off campus. Due to his violent nature, no teams offered him a buggy ride back home. Also, no one believed the man when he claimed that his house was the Titanic booth on Midway.

Dear Joe,
I love being a chemistry major because of the wealth of information it offers about our physical world. Unfortunately, whenever I head back to my rural hometown, no one wants to listen to me ramble on about orbitals. It’s no fair that I have to listen to hours of Zac Efron commentary, but my meaningful thoughts are put aside. How do I make others interested in what I do?
—Reactionary in Resnik
Dear Reactionary,
It always helps to put yourself in someone else’s shoes. Think of yourself as a Zac Efron major, specializing in High School Musical analysis with applications to appearances on Summerland.
You know everything Efron, from his favorite food — waffles — to his biggest TV guilty pleasure — Survivor. You read Seventeen to gain pertinent information on recent Efron developments and have even published several scholarly articles — blog posts — about his cohabitation with Disney.
Unfortunately, when you come home, all people want to talk about is quantum field theory and the existence of ethics in a post-modernist society. 
What a shame, too, because you have posters of Efron which would make even an icicle melt. I hope you understand my message. 
When you go home, deal with it. We’re not all interested in chemistry.
Get on the Efron right track,
—Joe
Dear Joe,
I have a good friend who smells awful. Sometimes we’ll be in a conversation, and he’ll lift his arms: I almost collapse from the reek. How do I tell him about this, or how do I at least learn to ignore it?
—Smelly in Scobell
Dear Smelly,
You can’t let your good friend go on in this world without telling him about his problem. First off, you should know that he probably can’t smell the odor himself. It’s hard to detect your own scent. Second, know that you aren’t the only one who is offended. Your friend’s waft of misery is costing him friendships, dates, and jobs. Somebody has to break the bad news. It may as well be you.
It’s natural if you’re nervous about telling the truth. That’s why I have an ingenious plan. Fight fire with fire, Smelly. If you really want to get your message across, skip hygiene for a few days. 
When your friend (hopefully) calls you out on it, bring it back to him. That way, it’ll be a problem you can tackle together. Note that this kind of solution generally doesn’t work with other problems, like drugs and World of Warcraft. 
If that method of attack doesn’t work, then I guess you’re out of luck. Maybe then it would be time to find more pleasant-smelling friends, like clove-smoking creative writing majors or Glade plug-ins.
Just plug it in, plug it in, 
—Joe

Dear Prince,
It’s me again. I know that you have yet to return any of my letters, but I do not hold it against you, as I know that you are extremely busy. I also know that in a little bit, when you release another glorious video of you doing your thing surrounded by gorgeous women, you will have been thinking of me when you made it and that you have not forgotten our love.
I hope that I am not being too forward, as only our souls have been acquainted and our eyes have yet to graze each others’ longingly. I tried to stow away in the storage compartment of your tour van once, back in 1993, but your security guards found me and told me not to take it so hard as they pried me from your steaming guitar case. Trouble is, I can’t get you out of my heart. I have bought several wigs to practice caressing your silky curls on. I brush my hand tenderly through your bangs each night.
I have tried to find a partner who is even half the man that you are, but there is no comparison. I have practiced 23 positions in all of my one-night stands: in the shower, holding on to the railing, in the kitchen. But baby, nothing comes close.
There is a dream that I keep having. We are standing at the edge of a lake. You have brought me here on your purple stallion, and you tease me with your half-smile. The twinkle in your eye is made even more brilliant by the glowing sun. The water reflects streaks of light across your sweet face. We are alone, at the crystalline waters of Lake Minnetonka. You do not fool me as you once fooled Apollonia. There are sturgeon fish all around, old as time. You tell me you will love me until the last sturgeon fish dies. I melt into your arms. There is a sunset.
Baby, don’t run from me. I know you are my soul mate and that we are meant to be together. Forever. I have never been so sure of anything in my life. My love for you is a river that follows you forever.
Please don’t throw away my letter. More importantly, please don’t throw away my love. I would die for you. 
Tenderly, with all my heart,
Callen

Few compilations of short stories pack a punch like AIDS Sutra does. Sutra — the Sanskrit word for “doctrine” or “narrative” — has been most popularly recognized as a part of the phrase Kama Sutra, an ancient Indian doctrine on sex, and while the usage of sutra in the title of this book is not intended to bring up this linkage, the association is fitting considering the discussions of sexual matters that the book elaborates on.  
Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, AIDS Sutra consists of real, raw, moving stories written by some of India’s finest writers, both those living in India and those of Indian descent living elsewhere in the world. Such authors as Man Booker prize-winning Salman Rushdie and Kiran Desai have contributed to this collection. The book also has an interesting foreword written by Amartya Sen, an Indian economist who won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1998, that provides an insight into the economic impact that AIDS can have on a country, a perspective that is hardly ever written about. 
The book approaches all the repercussions AIDS can cause: issues of ethics and secrecy for the patient, spouses unknowingly contracting the disease from their infected partners, orphaned and HIV-positive children, the consequences for the gay population, and many more. The stories are set in Indian society, one that is bound by a multitude of social constraints and stigmata attached to the idea of AIDS. All the writers describe personal experiences that they have gone through in coming in contact with the disease and being inspired to write something moving about it.
Desai’s story, “Night Claims the Godavari,” explores the world of sex workers in India and describes intimate details of their lives. She succeeds in invoking pity in the reader, even making the sex worker’s profession seem justified. These women have difficult lives that are bound by poverty and desperation, and the risk of contracting AIDS makes their situation even harder. 
Siddharth Dhanvant Shanghvi relates the story of a gay actor and how he tries to run away from the disease when it begins to take over his life. His words describe many HIV-positive people’s situation: a life plagued by constant fear — fear of being discovered, fear of the disease, fear of death. In the midst of all this fear, people tend to lose themselves and their identities. 
Rushdie’s story, “The Half-woman God,” is one of the most moving stories of all. He describes how AIDS affects the hijra population in India. Hijras are castrated men that, due to their situation, are ostracized from the community and are forced to spend their lives as prostitutes and beggars. Due to prostitution, they are constantly at risk of contracting AIDS. Rushdie gives readers a view into the lives of these hijras and thus strings together the connection between AIDS and yet another community in the Indian society.
Prostitutes, the gay population, and hijras all encapsulate different facets of the impact that AIDS has. But perhaps the most pitiable impact is that on the children of AIDS patients. Most of these children are also HIV positive, having inherited the disease since birth, and will live short and brutal lives. Many of them are orphaned as well, making life all the more hard. In his story, “*Bhoot ki Kahaanian*” — meaning “ghost stories” — Jaspreet Singh retells his experience spending time with HIV-positive children in an orphanage, describing many heart-rending stories about the lives some of these children lead.
All 16 stories contained in the book are unique. They evoke a wide range of emotions in the reader — sorrow, pity, shock, and anger. It is appalling that the number of HIV-positive people in India is growing so rapidly, but the Indian government refuses to acknowledge it. It is pitiable that AIDS patients are not granted the same rights and given the same status in Indian society as other individuals.

This Thursday April 23, beats will be dropped in the UC as several Carnegie Mellon student organizations pool their talents to put on a benefit concert called “Rebirth.” SPIRIT, CMU Turntable Club, WRCT, IMPACT, and the Black Business Association have all worked together to bring the spirit of rebirth in hip-hop to the Carnegie Mellon community and support arts education in the Pittsburgh area.
“The goal of the event is threefold,” said Gemma Easterling, a senior electrical and computer engineering major and organizer for the event. “We primarily want to raise funds to support the Arts Greenhouse hip-hop program, provide exposure of the program and what it offers to the Pittsburgh community, and involve the Carnegie Mellon community, giving them the opportunity to see positive hip-hop that is not often played on the radio.”
The concert will feature two internationally renowned female hip-hop artists who create powerful music with positive content. “I’m most excited for the female MCs,” Easterling commented. “The media often portrays female hip-hop artists in one light, but these women bring a strong positive, political message.”
MC Invincible hails from Detroit and uses her music as an outlet to combine hip-hop with social action. She empowers her community through art by spearheading projects that include youth-led media and a collectively held music label.
Similarly, Brooklyn-based MC, vocalist, poet, and playwright Queen GodIs moves crowds with her thought-provoking lyrics. 
Her diverse background includes working as an education consultant, being a youth mentor, and leading a New York City teen poetry slam team to a national championship.
Chrystal Miller, a sophomore biology major, believes the concert will help “people get exposed to a  different side of what hip-hop is about.” She said, “A lot of what gets played on the radio or at parties is not representative of all of hip-hop music, so I was really excited when I heard that our campus was hosting this event and bringing in artists who have something more to offer than music about guns, women, and money.” 
Local artists Formula 412, Pittsburgh’s hip-hop band; Jasiri X, a Pittsburgh-based political lyricist; and the International Freestylers, a Pittsburgh based b-boy crew, will join the headliners on stage. 
In addition to the musical acts, the venue will highlight local clothing designers, entrepreneurs, and graffiti artists, with refreshments provided by local restaurants. While the event aims to raise community awareness of positive hip-hop culture, it will also serve as a fundraiser for the Arts Greenhouse, a project of Carnegie Mellon’s Center for the Arts in Society. 
The Arts Greenhouse project is in danger of fading due to lack of funding in the current harsh economic climate, and 100 percent of the proceeds from the concert will benefit the program.
“I really wish I could be a part of this concert, but the project is one of the many reasons why I want to attend Carnegie Mellon,” said Imani Palmer, a high school student who worked with Easterling for one of her school projects.
Through a series of workshops, the Arts Greenhouse teaches Pittsburgh high school students real-world skills to help them pursue musical careers, from writing and producing music to distributing and marketing it. 
Participants are given the opportunity to work with local hip-hop artists and CMU’s state-of-the-art recording equipment, and perform publicly.
“I wish projects like [the Arts Greenhouse] were everywhere because they help kids like me find what we are interested in. I know I want to be involved with music for the rest of my life,” Palmer said.
Easterling said that the program is important because “lots of kids in Pittsburgh are interested in music but don’t have access to the resources to produce their own. We give them the opportunity to interact with local hip-hop artists and Carnegie Mellon students, maybe even inspiring them to pursue higher education.”
The event takes place Thursday from 6 to 9 p.m. in Rangos.

This year at Carnival, waiting in lines turned into a main event. Get In Line, a student-sponsored project out of Carnegie Mellon’s Entertainment Technology Center, used Carnival to test a series of gameplay experiences for people waiting in last weekend’s most daunting lines and crowds. 
Using what people like most about playing video games — stories and a sense of accomplishment — a team developed a set of easy activities that aimed to keep people optimistic about their queue.
With locations at Midway, the University Center, and Tech Street, Get In Line positioned their stations intentionally to target traditional Carnival experiences like getting a funnel cake, waiting for buggies to roll, and waiting for the comedian to begin.
The project’s sponsors, masters of entertainment technology students Tracy Brown, Josh Jeffery, and Natasha Kelkar, tried out the concept of using video games to make lines more entertaining in the University Center’s Wean Commons last semester for the ETC’s Building Virtual Worlds show, but decided to re-pitch their idea this semester in order to test their concept on the captive and diverse Carnival crowds.
While waiting in lines may seem fairly innocuous, Brown and her team know that there are quite a few industries where too much line-waiting can result in a drop in revenue.
“Excessive waiting causes negative brand affinity,” Brown said. “People tend to blame the person that created the line for their wait.”
The team found two positive things about waiting in lines: anticipation for the event itself and the ability to develop a sense of camaraderie between individuals waiting together a phenomenon Brown calls “queue-munity.”
Their biggest hit this year was the jumbotron at the corner of Tech and Frew Streets, which allowed people waiting for Buggy heats to text-message in their vote on which team they thought would win, and also showed live video footage of the race.
“It’s hard to run around to see all the different hills, but the screen makes it easy to stay in one place,” said Mary Sullivan, aunt of a recent alumnus. “I haven’t been texting, but I like seeing who other people think is going to win.”
Senior computer science major Owen Yamauchi, who came out for Saturday’s Buggy finals, said he enjoyed Get In Line’s text-in poll. “I voted for Fringe B. It’s pretty cool to see your vote count in real time.”
While the jumbotron stole the show at the Buggy races, Midway’s stations gave a better show of the range of Get In Line’s technologies and, according to Brown, ended up teaching the team quite a bit.
Midway’s most popular activities were a voice-activated airship racing game, where small helium-filled balloons rose faster as players screamed louder, and the “Buggy Button Mash,” which allowed players to use their cell phone buttons to push a buggy through a course. And what did they learn from the weekend?
“We probably shouldn’t have put a screaming game next to the alumni tent after they’d been such a good partner,” said Brown.
According to Brown, the team also learned from comedian Zach Galifianakis’s line that proximity to the event increases the customer’s line experiences.
They might also have to change their technique in the future to make sure the public understands that there is no payment involved. Eventually, the team hopes to market their services to places where lines could affect brand affinity and customer experiences.
They are working on a project with Penny Arcade Expo, where their task will be to keep a line of 6000 people occupied for two hours.  They also have already spun the ETC project into a new company, Evil Genius Designs, of which Brown is the CEO.
Brown is optimistic that her new company will find quite a bit of business, explaining that in many cases, lines are used intentionally as capture points. 
Theme parks specifically rely on longer lines to create longer park stays and generate more concessions revenue.
“Lines aren’t going away any time soon,” Brown said. She and her team are just trying to make them more fun.

Students at the University of Maryland planned a screening of the adult film Pirates II: Stagnetti’s Revenge after discovering that Carnegie Mellon had already shown the film on campus, until Maryland state senators threatened to pull funding for the university.
“The film had been scheduled to play at Hoff [Student Center] since well before spring break, but I did not hear about any controversy until April 2 when I read about the proposed state legislature’s amendment removing federal funding for state universities and colleges that screened triple-X films for non-educational purposes,” said Emily Kay, a first-year undecided major at the University of Maryland. “The university had to pull the film because of the threat to [cut] funding.”
The amendment, introduced by Sen. Andy Harris, called for any university or college’s state funding to be blocked if that college or university screened triple-X rated adult films, excluding films viewed as part of a class.
The university’s decision to cancel the screening of Pirates II has drawn cries of censorship and sparked free speech demonstrations across the Maryland campus.
“Students at UMD — or on any college campus, public or private — have a right to see such films on campus for several reasons,” argued Kay, who is normally not a fan of porn. “You still have to show ID and be 18 to see the film, so nothing illegal there. The state should not dictate what is appropriate to be shown in our movie theater — we might be students, but we aren’t children.”
Another unlikely ally is English professor Martha Smith, who is a self-described feminist.
She said, “I personally believe that movies like Pirates II serve to exploit women and misrepresents their sexuality ... but Senator Andy Harris has turned it [the movie] into an issue of free speech.”
University of Maryland officials themselves have also voiced their support for Pirates II.
Kay explained, “Even after legislation was proposed, our vice president for student affairs Linda Clement maintained her position that showing the film would be valuable to sparking on-campus discussion.”
At Carnegie Mellon, on the other hand, Pirates II has already been screened in McConomy Auditorium, and the school is planning another showing of pornography on April 26. 
Last semester, Pirates II and The Dark Knight tied for third most popular draw after WALL-E and Iron Man. Both at Maryland and at Carnegie Mellon, these movies do not rely on university funds, but are donated to the schools by students or even the producers themselves of the pornographic movies.
Kay said, “*Pirates* was not even purchased by the University, so state funding was only indirectly involved by using the on-campus theater.”
There is still a significant portion of the Carnegie Mellon student body that is uncomfortable with the university’s tolerance of explicit material.
“I’m surprised that they would allow it,” said first-year computer science major Joseph Lum, who is a member of the Asian Christian Fellowship and considers himself a Christian. 
“I don’t think they should screen it.... Pornography is wrong, and an educational institution, such as Carnegie Mellon, should not sanction this material,” Lum said.
Past screenings of pornography have also drawn similar protests from Carnegie Mellon’s religious community.
“It [*Pirates II*] seemed like a chance to open discussion on campus about pornography as a film [genre], not promoting it but informing and engaging students so that they can make their own educated opinions,” Kay said.
“The state completely overstepped their bounds into university and student life. I really love the different perspectives that I am exposed to at University of Maryland; it’s one of the main reasons I came here, and for the state to limit my views and determine what is appropriate for me to discuss is really insulting to [the] institution of the University of Maryland and to me as a student.”

Two Carnegie Mellon students, Jarrett Adams and Kush Mangal, have come up with the idea of organizing a competition for the best “Scottie cheer.”
This competition was kicked off on Carnival weekend and will be going on until April 29. The best cheer will be chosen from the many entries that will be posted on YouTube. This cheer will be part of the orientation process for next year’s first-year class, which will be taught the cheer so the students can remember their school spirit for the following four years.
“We thought of this competition mainly because we want to see a vast increase in school spirit at Carnegie Mellon,” said Jarrett Adams, sophomore H&SS interdisciplinary student. “Because of the vast amount of talent on campus, we decided that putting the cheer in the student body's hands was the most beneficial thing we could do.”
Facebook groups, events, and other advertisements are being used by the organizers to raise awareness and encourage students to take part in this competition. 
Adams also commented, “When I was in high school, school spirit was a huge part of my life. Coming to Carnegie Mellon and not having the unity year-round we see at Orientation and Spring Carnival became somewhat alarming to me. I thought, well, I'd like to see this awesome sense of community all the time.”
Ashhad Khan, a sophomore civil engineer and rugby team member, said, “ I think that our team would do much better than we do if we knew that we had the support of our entire university behind us. This competition will provide the opportunity for students to show their fellow students and members of their school’s athletic teams that they are with their school.”
This is not only the case for athletic teams but also for teams representing the university in every other sphere.
When asked about his opinion of the competition, Sagar Shah, a sophomore in electrical and computer engineering, replied, “I think it’s a great idea that everyone is trying to raise school spirit. Even though we have a lot of school spirit, that is one area Carnegie Mellon definitely needs to work on.”

Soda giants all over the country just might be in for a shock.
In New York City, health commissioner Thomas Frieden has set in his sights a dangerous target: placing a per-ounce tax on soda and sugar drinks under the guise of fighting the good fight against obesity. You thought things were getting expensive now? Just wait until Frieden’s proposed $3 tax per crate of soft drinks hypothetically takes effect. Soda drinkers might well find themselves in the same position as SUV owners did when gas prices skyrocketed.
Why the huge amount? The tax is deliberately high so as to discourage people from drinking soda, a move Frieden is taking to help propel America into a new era of health. Take this with a grain of salt — or rather don’t, since Frieden is pushing hard to get companies to remove salt from their products as well.
The soda tax, though, demands more attention. Frieden’s logic classes soda and sugared beverages in the same category as cigarettes: a luxury item proven to be dangerous to your health. The logic for the cigarettes is clearly that with enough monetary incentive not to buy them, consumers will either wean themselves off of them or will switch their spending habits, buying less of other items to compensate for the extra money they must spend due to the tax. Frieden hopes for the former.
However, while his intentions may seem good on the outset (yes, America and its population could stand to get a little healthier), Frieden’s plan is anything but beneficial.
When did it become the government’s job to police everything that its citizens do? People ought to have the freedom to choose how they want to live their lives, whether it’s healthily or unhealthily. While smoking has been proven to be bad for your health, people should still be allowed to do it, because it is their choice. Placing a tax on smoking is understandable, as there are proven consequences for making a habit of it. One can argue that drinking a lot of soda has its consequences as well. Then again, one can also argue that eating a lot of anything can have negative consequences.
However, Frieden’s push to pass the soda tax does beg the question: Are Americans these days so incapable of moderating their own diets that they need the government to come in and tell us how much is enough?
This seems like a lesson you learn in preschool. You need to tell yourself how much is enough, not ask someone else to do it for you.
Soda is not the leading cause of the obesity calamity in the United States. You can attribute that honor to any food that is overeaten. By itself, consuming large quantities of soda is not a health hazard. I offer as a counterexample the amazing John Mackey, professor of mathematics and known soda aficionado. Mackey, as his students can attest, drinks a legendary amount of soda, but remains in extremely good health due to his rigorous exercise schedule.
The bottom line is that people are not going to instantly start losing weight because of a soda tax, perhaps not even from quitting soda. Maintaining a healthy weight is about exercising and eating the correct portions of food, not making one class of foods anathema. While it seems silly that the government would be wasting its time over such an inefficient way of improving health, the fact that the soda tax has been proposed foretells, perhaps, something more sinister.
When our government seriously entertains the idea of limiting what we as citizens can and cannot do, it should be cause for alarm. If, say, Frieden, concerned about a rise in carpal tunnel cases, decided that a crochet or yarn tax was in order, everyone would laugh at it. It seems apparent that just as carpal tunnel doesn’t stem from one source, obesity, likewise, stems from many different causes. It also seems apparent that this proposal would limit personal freedom.
Why then are we allowing such ludicrous proposals to be considered? Putting an extra tax on soda not only will prove to be ineffective in the fight against obesity, but will also take away from the freedoms that generations of Americans have fought so hard to protect.
We are a country that believes in doing what we want to do, having the freedom to make our own choices, and having the integrity to face the consequences of our actions. It seems like detracting from those beliefs with something as petty as a soda tax is a far cry from the direction we want to be moving.
Frieden is correct that the health of America as a whole is in a sorry state. His campaign to get fast food restaurants to post the nutritional facts for their menu items is something that I laud. People should have as much knowledge as they can before making a choice. However, there is a difference between making information that was not as apparent clearer and forcing people to think or act a certain way. Frieden’s work with getting the nutritional facts in easy-to-spot places allows the consumer to make a choice, which is an infinitely better solution than steering them toward one and only one option.
Alex Yuschik (ahy@) doesn’t even like soda. She will, however, continue to eat salt relentlessly and laugh if and when Frieden gets a goiter.

Throughout my years of elementary school and middle school, I saw teachers branding students as “brilliant,” “dumb,” “kid-with-a-potential-for-greatness,” “absolutely abysmal.” I have never really approved of this branding — it either made children think too highly of themselves or think that they had no promise at all — and when I heard of another label being put on children — that of “potential terrorist” — I flipped out.
According to an article in the British publication The Independent, the police have identified 200 schoolchildren in the U.K. as “potential terrorists,” as these children were “vulnerable to Islamic radicalization.” The aim of this picking and choosing, it seems, is to change the mentality of the children at a young age and prevent new terrorists from developing.
While the ultimate goal of this process may seem noble — preventing the creation of more terrorists is great — I have issues with the way this is being done. The details of what is going to be done with this group of children seem a little unclear. The article explains that the selected children will be a part of a program that includes discussions with parents, teachers, and the local imam. But it also states that “a handful have had intervention directly by the police.” “Direct police intervention” could mean anything — and having a rather wild imagination, I’ve been having visions of the worst. Even if we consider the best scenario, that the program only involves discussions with the children, picking out a handful of children and telling them that they are being given therapy sessions as they are more prone to blowing up the world than their other classmates is not the way to go about doing this.
Labeling children as anything has a profound effect on how they turn out later on. If you take a handful of children aside and label them as “dangerous,” they are going to feel intimidated. It’s not hard to imagine what the natural tendency of such children would be — would they realize that the counseling is for their own good and that of the rest of the world, or would they start thinking that they are being targeted and prosecuted for no apparent reason? Although this may not occur in all the cases, I believe that for a majority of cases, the counseling will only end up in producing children with low self-esteem who feel that they are always under the scrutiny of the public eye and the law. In fact, this might result in the exact opposite effect of what the authorities are hoping for; instead of preventing these children from turning to terrorism, the program might end up affecting the child’s self-confidence to such an extent that he or she might turn to extremist groups for protection. Although this is the extreme case of what may happen, what is more likely to occur is that children who could have grown to be confident, smart individuals will grow up to be nervous adults.
Programs like this are examples of desperation and thoughtlessness in difficult times. I agree that as terrorist attacks become more and more frequent, people feel the urgent need to do something about it, but if the plans are not well thought out, they could have serious repercussions. The authorities need to think about the consequences of the programs they plan before implementing them. If the authorities were really concerned about extremist groups’ influencing young children, they could start programs in schools that educated all children about the dangers of wrong influences. The discussions in the program could be the same, but if they were directed at all children instead of just a select group of children, they might be more effective and less intimidating.
The authorities have to realize that dealing with such issues, especially when they relate to children, can be extremely tricky, and have to be handled with utmost care.
Akanksha Vaidya’s (avvaidya@) hate for labels has nothing to do with the fact that she was always labeled as “the-girl-who-was-super-quiet-in-class.”

April 15, the deadline for filing taxes, saw a rather unique form of demonstration — Pittsburghers participated in the Pittsburgh tea party to protest a possible increase in taxes as a consequence of the stimulus package and the federal government bailouts. 
This past Wednesday, nearly 1500 people gathered on the Allegheny River landing and threw tea bags into it, mimicking the revolutionary Boston Tea Party. Around 500 cities and towns across the nation held this tax day tea party to protest against the economic policies of the government, especially the multi billion-dollar stimulus package and the trillion-dollar budget.
The idea fora nationwide tea parties came from CNBC commenter Rick Santelli, who suggested that people protest the Obama administration’s “bad behavior” by having a tea party in Chicago. The idea took off from there and led to the creation of a website, taxdayteaparty.com, that listed all the confirmed tea party demonsration locations across the country. Pittsburgh’s tea party also had a Facebook group with information about the event.
Although the reasons for the demonstrations had nothing to do with tea, we believe that protesting in this way was a creative move on the part of the people. The demonstrators succeeded in grabbing the attention of the media with this unusual form of protest.
Although a number of media sources have mocked the tea parties — an opinion piece in The New York Times sarcastically called the tea parties “a symbolic rebellion for times that once again are trying men’s souls” — both good and bad publicity has succeeded in spreading the message of the protestors. Perhaps the demonstrators would not have received so much attention had they adhered to the traditional form of protest and just rallied across the country. 
Although it remains to be seen how, if at all, the government will respond to these nationwide protests, we commend the demonstrators for coming up with an interesting way to put forth their demands.

According to the practice of Ohio Wesleyan University, literally trashing, as in throwing away, the independently run campus newspaper is acceptable if the administration believes the paper’s content reflects poorly on the school’s image. Doesn’t that sound like censorship? We certainly think so. 
So maybe this isn’t as serious as Hitler’s propaganda during World War II and the regulation and censorship of almost all the media that streams throughout China and North Korea, but these actions are still unacceptable.
The Transcript, Ohio Wesleyan’s campus newspaper, ran an article detailing a campus tradition of students counting down the days to graduation with two drinks a day at a local bar. Due to a picture of a beer bottle that was featured on the front page, staffmembers of the admissions office saw fit to trash hundreds of copies of the paper before the campus was showcased to prospective students, parents, and families. 
Censorship is never the correct choice of action for the administration or the paper. Though the paper may have portrayed the students of the university in a less-than-flattering light, the fact of the matter is that the story was true.
It is no secret that college students, especially seniors as they near graduation day, drink, and trying to hide this only misinforms the prospective students and their parents and is not beneficial to anyone. Throwing away and censoring the newspaper will not change the reality that students drink.
As a paper with no qualms about printing unbiased and sometimes critical articles about Carnegie Mellon, we appreciate the respect our administration has shown in never trashing (literally or figuratively) our issues. Even when we print controversial pieces, we do so with the intention of informing our public about what we think is newsworthy, what we think it is our duty to report.
We give Ohio Wesleyan’s administration a [censor] finger.

You may have noticed that we — along with pretty much every other media source — harp every week on how the economy is not doing well. The media seems to have been saying this for months, and we have yet to see signs of great improvement.
Instead of glossing over the newest government plan to create relief or the latest company in need of relief, in this week’s “Reminder of the Bad Economy,” we are going to talk about a law firm with a very creative solution.
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom has recently offered all 1300 of their associates the opportunity to take a year off and still receive a third of their base salary. Yes, that is right, a year during which they need to do absolutely no work for the company, or even any work at all, and they will still receive $80,000.
The employees were also promised that by accepting the offer, their future career would not be jeopardized.
Nearly every college student we know would gladly jump at the opportunity to make $80k a year while spending their time on whatever piqued their interest in the moment, instead of working. Skadden has already seen about 10 percent of their employees express interest.
We want to commend Skadden for coming up with a creative solution that happens to appeal not only to college students, but also to overworked lawyers who would like to take time off to finish their Ph.D.s, spend time with their families, and travel the world.
By creating this program with no strings attached, they have given their employees an opportunity to take on something new while, at the same time, enabling themselves not to lay off their associates in these rough economic times.

For years, students have been unhappy with the current on-campus dining system. While there are many issues that could be raised regarding meal plans, eating options, etc., one point of controversy seems surprisingly easy to fix.
In the current dining system, students who have meal plans have four meal periods on weekdays and three meal periods on weekends. Students may only use a maximum of one meal block per meal period, which is problematic for several reasons. If students do not use their blocks on an even, day-by-day basis, their blocks pile up toward the end of the two-week dining period, and this eventually results in the students’ having more blocks remaining than meal periods in which to use them. This results in students’ losing their leftover blocks at the end of the two-week period, when they might have used them at some other time if they had been able to — and thus would have avoided losing their money.
In addition, on many occasions, students cannot adequately plan their own meal times. By this I mean that if a student gets hungry twice within a given meal period, the student cannot use another meal block until the next meal period commences. This is problematic because students’ schedules are widely varied, and sometimes it is impossible to fit one’s eating schedule into the time frames set by the meal periods.
Additionally, not being able to use multiple blocks in a meal period prevents students from using their blocks to pay for guests on campus, as they are able to do at many other universities. Students are either forced to use their DineX in these situations, which they may have been saving for some other time, or else the guests must pay for their own meals. Alternatively, students simply take their guests to eat off campus and, in doing so, deprive Carnegie Mellon Dining Services of a potential source of business.
This situation can be fixed by changing the system to one that limits daily blocks rather than blocks per meal period. A limit of five meal blocks per day would be easy to implement and would allow students to more effectively manage their meal plans and eliminate wasted blocks.
Students would also be able to plan their daily eating habits around their own schedules and could use extra blocks to pay for their guests. This would encourage students to bring guests to eat on campus, which would in turn support the Carnegie Mellon dining system.
Want to help change the current meal block system? Then sign our petition online at http://www.thepetitionsite.com/1/remove-block-limits-at-carnegie-mellon or in person at the tables outside of Doherty Hall on Tuesday, April 21 between noon and 6 p.m.

This letter is in response to the April 13 article, “Students get free admission.”
I am a strong believer that diversity will lead to a strong and healthy community. I do not believe, however, that diversity should be the primary factor for students’ getting into college.
When university admissions offices and lawmakers make decisions based solely to promote diversity, they are making a serious error. Admitted students should show a balance between ethnic diversity, academic strength, and personal uniqueness.
In no way does the 10 percent admissions law in Texas promote this necessary balance. Even if the law does promotes ethnic diversity, it does so at the expense of students who have stronger academics and likely have vibrant personalities.
Furthermore, this law demonstrates a complete lack of faith in  our fellow Americans. We are a great country because we willingly embrace people of every race, religion, and creed.
If campus diversity only exists because the law forces us to have it, then our universities are no better than the students who chucked rocks at the Little Rock Nine in 1957.
I believe our nation has come a long way since those days, and that campus officials can be trusted to promote a healthy balance within the campus community. We do not need a law to force the issue, especially when it unfairly places ethnic diversity as the primary factor for college admissions.

While I agree with Joe Bialek’s support for embryonic stem cell research, as indicated in his letter to the editor (April 13), I disagree with the method by which he arrives at that conclusion.
While I agree with Mr. Bialek that life begins at conception, it does not follow that “those conceived under the laws of the United States are protected by the Constitution.” Constitutional protections only apply to individuated human beings, not to entities that are physiologically dependent fetuses or embryos.
Also, Mr. Bialek’s appeal to sacrifice as a justification for embryonic stem cell research is an incorrect method for arguing the benefits of stem cell research, for one could counter his appeal to sacrifice with the contention that those suffering from diseases potentially amenable to stem cell therapy should sacrifice for the sake of embryos.
Ultimately, stem cell research is justified not by sacrifice, but by the fact that an embryo possesses no rights and therefore has no right to life.

Last weekend, Carnival took over campus as booths, buggies, and mobots competed for top prizes while campus media organizations, such as The Tartan, worked to provide coverage of the events.
For the first time ever, The Tartan provided live coverage via photo streams and Twitter posts to keep the Carnegie Mellon community up to date throughout the festivities. Other campus organizations, such as the Spring Carnival Committee, Buggy, and Scotch’n’Soda, also used Twitter to keep everyone informed, and anyone could tag Tweets with #cmucarnival to have them show up in the Tartan Carnival feed.
This use of multimedia and technology — not just within The Tartan, but from various organizations participating in Carnival — was impressive. Live news and imagery from various Carnival events, as well as reminders of upcoming events, allowed members of the community to follow what was happening even if they couldn’t be present.
Through the use of technology and live update tools like Twitter, students brought the Carnival festivities to more people. Various organizations used each other’s Tweets to keep their followers informed and updated, and live updates allowed followers to keep track of who won Booth, who had the best times for Buggy, and which mobots dominated others on the course.
It wasn’t just with live updates that technology was showcased during Carnival — booths also included multimedia elements in the various games they contained. Many of the booths had computer-based games, bringing Booth into the 21st century.
For example, in AEPi’s booth, visitors could have their pictures taken. Tridelta’s booth had visitors running on a DDR pad in order to get Jack down the beanstalk, and in ZBT’s booth, visitors could play a virtual skateboard game and a Guitar Hero game.
Another Carnegie Mellon-led initiative, Get In Line, also brought technology to Carnival. Carnival-goers could play games while waiting in line on Midway and they could vote for which buggy they thought would win the race. Buggy spectators were also able to watch the races on the jumbotron and could see the teams’ progress throughout the course. This brought the excitement of every part of Buggy to the spectators.
The use of technology and multimedia at this year’s Carnival is likely only a preview of what is to come, and in coming years, I look forward to seeing more technology implemented both at Carnival and throughout the rest of the year.
