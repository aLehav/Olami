Greetings Buggy lovers, over-zealous alumni, and Tartan readers. 
Another year of Sweepstakes is rapidly approaching with 11 teams competing for the top spots. Carnival is less than a week away, just in time for my yearly predictions. With strong freerolls from the top-tier organizations, this race will prove to be both exciting and close. Given the conditions of the Chute, expect the hay bales to make plenty of friends come race day with the potential for a shake up at the top.
Starting with the women’s heats: Look for Fringe’s B team to come in at sixth place due to their technical expertise and slower pushers. SDC C will come in at fifth to be the lowest placing team for them. With strong pusher depth and equally strong buggies, they should find themselves in the second day. SDC B will edge out their C team competitors to place fourth. With the speed coming out of PiKA, Fringe, and SDC expect a close race at the top. PiKA’s slow push team from last year makes it an easy pick as the worst of the three. Fringe A will edge out PiKA but lose to the dynasty that SDC has on the women’s side. With nearly ten seconds over the competition last year, expect SDC to once again hoist the women’s trophy.
Moving over to the men’s side, I predict an extremely close race at the top with the top three teams rolling faster than years past. Starting from the bottom, PiKA’s abysmal performance last year as an organization will see the B team drop down to a speed just fast enough to make it to Day 2. CIA will finally find themselves in Day 2 with their new buggy and their motivated team. Fringe B, along with PiKA B, heads the list of disappointments as they will roll themselves into eighth place. Spirit A’s strong push team will land them in seventh place as long as the buggy can make it through the Chute. SDC C will be the first C team to ever break the 2:10 barrier as they prove to embarrass another A team this year. SigEp A will again roll strong with a powerful push team but will not make it into the upper echelon due to weak mechanics. The last four spots will be owned by SDC, Fringe, and PiKA again. PiKA A will look to redeem themselves this year and improve on their womanly slow time from last year. SDC B will break the B team record again a third year in a row and be the first B team to reach the 2:06–2:07 range. The top two teams will break away and make this a two-horse race for the top. Look for Fringe A to improve their team record from last year with a new buggy and Beta pushers. Finally, SDC A will take back the cup with the expected chip on their shoulder.
That’s it for me this year. My bets are on SDC to sweep the races and Fringe and PiKA to make things interesting. I will be there of course, but you’ll never see me.
SDC: FMB’s #1 fan
Fringe: Winners in 2001, 2010*
Spirit: You spin me right round, baby, right round.
Sig Ep: Is pushing buggy the only time you get behind a girl?
PiKA: If SDC builds a four-wheeler, will you copy that too?
Sig Nu: Buggy is their second favorite thing to roll.
AEPi: Robobuggy — Favorite to win in the non-competitive category.
Kap Sig: If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.
SAE: Slow Ass Engineering.
CIA: Ascending to the top 10 this year.
Pioneers: Discovering new ways to lose year in and year out.
Beta: Fringe’s new pledge class.
Predictions:
Men’s: SDC A; Fringe A; SDC B; PiKA A; Sig Ep A; SDC C; Spirit A; Fringe B; CIA A; PiKA B
Women’s: SDC A; Fringe A; PiKA A; SDC B; SDC C; Fringe B

On Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon track and field team hosted its annual quad meet. Penn State Behrend, Washington & Jefferson College, and Westminster College traveled to spend the day on the Carnegie Mellon track in Gesling Stadium.
On the women’s side, the Tartans earned themselves a second-place finish, while the men cleaned house and came in first.
“The competition was good. I was really excited about all the fans we had out here. It’s really exciting that for our only home meet we had so many friends and family come out to watch us,” said senior Laura McKee.
Although the sky was overcast, a few rays of sunshine shone through at times and the temperature was mild as the Tartans started their competition at 11 a.m.
The Tartans had many outstanding performances while competing on their home turf. First-year Jacqueline Guevel continues to be on fire as she breaks record after record.
“I think we all were really impressed with Jackie’s performances today. She qualified automatically for the 100- meter hurdles. It’s just very impressive. I don’t think she even knew she ran that fast. And then she also provisionally qualified in the 400-meter,” said junior Luci Laffitte.
Laffitte and her 4x100-meter relay, also consisting of senior Kim Nederlof, Guevel, and junior Ivana Moses, set the new school record at 50.13 seconds. McKee finished her last home meet in the best way possible with a career best in the 1,500-meter race.“This was definitely a big [personal record] for me, and I’m looking forward to races next week and conference the week after. Hopefully [I’ll] improve my time even more.”
On the field, junior Lisa Marion Garcia pole-vaulted 2.95 meters, almost setting a new school record. Senior Melissa Hwang also finished strong at home, winning the triple jump with a distance of 10.40 meters.
Reflecting on the men’s results, senior captain Nate Bussiere said, “I think we did well. We had a lot of good performances all across the board, men and women. Turned out to be a nice day, so it was pretty good.” Bussiere contributed to the team with a second-place finish in the 1,500-meter race.
Sophomore Noel Titus was 0.06 seconds off breaking the school record as he finished first in the 100-meter dash, and he then followed that by winning the 200-meter dash.
Bussiere said “I think grouping our 800-meter guys together as a whole [helped]. There were a lot of them and they all ran really well.” Sophomore Ben Nealy won the 800-meter run in 1:57.84. 
The first-years added to the strong Tartan finish, with first-year Josh Newby finishing first in the 3,000-meter steeplechase with a time of 8:57.93 and Tim Kikta finishing first in the 400-meter run with a time of 50.43 seconds. On the field, first-year Nathan Cheek won the hammer with a distance of 47.42 meters, while first-year Zachary Erra-Hernandez won the shot put and discus.
Strong performances came from senior Justin Kurp and junior Kyle Andrews as they finished first and second, respectively, in the 3,000-meter run with times of 8:57.93 and 9:00.49.
Ending on a high note, the 4x400-meter relay team of Bussiere, Nealy, first-year David Keyser, and senior Dustin Musselman finished first with a time of 3:23.88.
Looking back on the meet, Bussiere said, “Well, it’s a quad meet so it’s pretty small, but it’s kinda nice [because] it gives you space to kinda do what you need to do ... without being all cluttered.”
The Tartans will compete on Friday at Bucknell University.

For those of you that are NBA fans, which I know may vary considering we live in a city with no true NBA team, I am sure that you are gearing up for the NBA playoffs that start in just under two weeks. As of right now, we already know which teams will be in the field of 16, but we do not know who our first-round matchups are just yet. 
In fact, one of the most important games of the season will be played Monday, a grudge match between the pompous Miami Heat and the defensive-minded Boston Celtics. This game should decide the No. 2 and No. 3 seeds in the Eastern Conference, which means a lot considering the opponents that each team could face.
Any true NBA fan definitely enjoys the playoffs, even if his or her team isn’t in them, because of the number of close games that happen almost every year.
When people say that March Madness is so much better than the NBA, they couldn’t be any more incorrect. Think back to two years ago, when the No. 7 seed Chicago Bulls took on the defending champion Boston Celtics in a first-round matchup that everyone believed would be a blowout in favor of the Celtics.
However, the Bulls came out and took the first game of the series in an overtime thriller, sending a message to all of the NBA that they would be competing to win, not just to take a few games. At the end of an exhilarating series that featured four games that went into overtime, the Celtics eventually pulled it out.
Fast forward to later that year, and we got to witness what was one of the best series of all time between the Orlando Magic and the Cleveland Cavaliers, which was eventually won by the Magic.
So, why do I bring these historical results up? Well, that is all I needed to prove that the NBA playoff season is one of the best times of the year, just because of the competitiveness of the games and the good chance that a game will come down to the final two minutes no matter what.
This year, it seems as if the matchup that everyone is looking forward to seeing in the Eastern Conference is the potential matchup between the Miami Heat and New York Knicks. Both teams have at least two superstars, and Miami obviously has its “Big Three” that basically proclaimed themselves to be the champions after LeBron “took his talents to South Beach.” I feel that this is the only chance for an upset in the Eastern Conference, as the East is extremely top-heavy when it comes to the playoffs, especially this year. Once we get through the first rounds, however, that is when the real fun will begin in the East.
This year’s MVP, Derrick Rose, will look to bring the first championship back to Chicago since Michael Jordan. The previously mentioned Heat will try and justify their big talk during the summer. The Celtics look to prove that they still have a few more runs left in them to compete for the championship. And, of course, Dwight Howard looks to get over his kryptonite, winning an NBA Championship.
Over in the Western Conference, we always get the treat of seeing a ton of great first-round matchups because of the unbelievable depth that the West presents. Although the top four teams are strong, the bottom four teams always have a chance to upset, and it will be awesome to see a team like the Memphis Grizzlies, who are one of the hottest teams in the country, go up against a veteran team like the San Antonio Spurs.
Not to mention the marquee matchups between the Portland Trail Blazers, who everyone seems to overlook, and the Dirk-led Mavericks, who have yet to get over their playoff woes as well. Not to mention the young Oklahoma City Thunder, who are coming off their first division title, against their division rival, the Denver Nuggets, who are probably the deepest team in the league at this point in the season. No matter what, the West is sure to have its drama, as most of these teams hate each other from that long regular-season grind.
The NBA playoffs are definitely “Where Amazing Happens.” Whether it be Bruce Bowen blindside tackling Steve Nash into the scorer’s table, Jordan pushing off Byron Russell and sinking a game-winner, or LeBron hitting a miracle three-pointer at the buzzer to give the Cavs a win over the Magic, the playoffs pack a huge punch of excitement.
I expect this season to be on par with, if not better than, past years, and like many of you, cannot wait.

Three hundred and sixty-four days ago, I wrote an article titled “Jumping off the bandwagon,” in which I urged fans to not look to their teams’ early success as a preview for a record-setting, or even successful, season.
What I failed to mention, though, was that fans need not (and should not) read into negative starts to the season either.
There has been a whirlwind of emotions throughout the first full week of baseball. Aside from Manny Ramirez’s “you can’t fire me, I quit” retirement on Friday, many baseball fans have had their focus on the early season struggles of the Red Sox, a.k.a. the “winners” of the offseason (no Sheen intended).
The Red Sox, who traded for Adrian Gonzalez and signed Carl Crawford this winter, went 0–6 to begin the season, mainly due to an offense that appears to still be in hibernation mode. Fans definitely took some solace in the team’s first win coming against the Yankees.
It doesn’t help that Sox fans are calling for Crawford’s head after he went four-for-23 during his team’s inaugural road trip — and while Adrian has done just fine, he’s only got one home run so far. With Sox fans expecting at least 60 with 150 RBI this year, it seems the only choice left is to throw in the towel and wait till next year.
These performances will not help either player’s chances in the All-Star voting that will probably begin next week, but no matter how much that counts, the remaining 153 games in the Red Sox’ schedule count far more. A 1–7 record through eight games might sting, but all it takes is one winning streak to get the team back on the right foot. The Atlanta Braves began 2010 with an 8–14 record before winning the NL wild card five months later, and to a lesser extent, the 1986 Mets began the season 2–3 before not losing another game in April and beating the Sox in the World Series.
Sure, Crawford may have an off year, but he will still contribute and be a part of the team for years to come. The same goes for Adrian, who was made to play in Fenway Park and will no doubt have a very productive season. The chances of every player on the Red Sox having a statistically down year are minuscule, and when the team is clicking on all cylinders, they will be the juggernaut that many expect them to be.
The early woes of the Red Sox have been the identical woes of the Rays and the success of the Orioles. The Rays won the division last year, and although they were depleted over the winter, they should be concerned with their slow start; on the other hand, the Orioles were downright awful until mid-August last year and have been playing like they mean it. Once the Sox and Rays get going, I expect the AL East to be even more of a force to be reckoned with than it was last year.
So don’t worry, fans; there’s a light at the end of the tunnel, but there are also 153 games to play until you get there.

The term “Subway Series” doesn’t quite fit, but perhaps “street match” would suffice to describe the action between the women’s tennis teams of Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh last Wednesday. The Tartans hosted the Division I Panthers from down the street and fell 6–3 to move to 10–6 on the year.
The Tartans entered the match with an excellent 30–12 doubles record during the outdoor season, but were unable to muster a win in doubles play against Pitt. The closest match came at third doubles, where senior Ashley Herrick and junior Cze-Ja Tam fought to a 6–8 loss to the hands of Panthers Minh Evans and Taylor Washington.
At singles play, junior Laura Chen deftly won her match at first singles, 6–1, 6–0. Tam earned another point for the Tartans by sweeping Pittsburgh’s Karma Parbhu 6–0, 6–0 at fourth singles. Senior Jennifer Chui got the Tartans’ third and final point after winning a marathon third set and match at fifth singles, 1–6, 6–3, 12–10.
Carnegie Mellon’s women will host Grove City College today, April 11, at 4 p.m. It will be their final regular season match before the University Athletic Association (UAA) conference championships later this month and the NCAA tournament in May.

The No. 7 Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team traveled to the Great Lakes Colleges Association (GLCA) Men’s Tennis Championship, hosted by Albion College.
In the second round of the GLCA tournament, the Tartans defeated Calvin College 6–1. The Tartans earned two points after doubles play, with both the No. 1 team of seniors Alex Nemerov and Bobby MacTaggart and No. 2 duo of sophomores Harsha Rao and Jooho Yu winning 8–4. MacTaggart and Nemerov both won their respective singles, while junior Jeremy King toppled his opponent 6–0, 6–3, followed by first-year Julian Pearlman, who dropped only two games 6–1, 6–1. This concluded the Tartans’ first day at the GLCA tournament.
In the semifinals, the Tartans took on University Athletic Association foe Case Western Reserve University. The Tartans took a 2–1 lead after doubles. The first point came from Nemerov and MacTaggart with an 8–7 (7–5) victory at No. 1 doubles, and the second point came from No. 2 team of King and sophomore Duke Miller who won 8–0.
At this point the Tartans took the court with Nemerov, Miller, MacTaggart, Rao, King, and Yu. King was first off the court with a 6–0, 6–3 win. Next off was MacTaggart adding a point with a 6–4, 7–5 victory, and Duke Miller clinched the match for the Tartans with his 7–6, 0–6, 6–2 victory. Since the match was played to decision, Yu’s match was stopped, but Nemerov remained on the court to finish for individual ranking. After battling a long third set, Nemerov came off with a 6–2, 3–6, 7–5 win, giving the Tartans a 6–2 victory over Case.
In the finals, the Tartans took on No. 19 DePauw University. The men got off to a slow start after going down 3–0 in doubles. The Tartans attempted to mount a comeback in singles play as Nemerov was first off the court with a 6–1, 6–3 victory, bringing the score to 3–1. However, the Tartans did not have enough in the tank, and DePauw won two singles matches, bringing the match to a 5–1 decision.

Business administration major and Pittsburgh native Ian Bangor has been a consistently strong player on the Carnegie Mellon men’s golf team this year. 
As one of only four first-years, Bangor has made a significant impact on the team, and learned a good amount from the sport as well.
Beginning the sport at the age of six, Bangor was influenced to play by his father, a Carnegie Mellon golf team alumnus. Having his father there from the start, he was able to learn the fundamentals of golf at a young age. Since then, Bangor has taken lessons from PGA professionals and has kept up his game by playing against his father in his spare time for fun.
He has been devoting his summers to numerous golf tournaments, ranging from Pittsburgh-area courses to traveling to various states across the country.
Choosing to play at Carnegie Mellon because of the good team dynamics, Bangor finds himself interacting with the golfers daily. “We have team dinners during trips, and team workouts in the winter. We hang out a lot as a team,” he said. Using this team dynamic in a positive way, Bangor keeps himself going during moments of poor play by focusing on the feeling of accomplishment when he plays well. “Being such a mental sport, you get into streaks of bad play sometimes. But when you do play well, there are very few things that are more rewarding,” Bangor said.
Bangor sees himself playing golf for the rest of his life, and knows that it is something he will always be passionate about. 
He describes it as something besides school that he is really driven to do. Having played the sport for over 10 years now, Bangor has learned numerous lessons, involving golf as well as general life occurrences. Bangor said, “Even when things seem like they’re at their worst, you just have to keep going and find something to keep you going.”

The Carnegie Mellon ski and snowboard team, created in 2005 and, over the years, has grown to encompass men’s and women’s teams in alpine ski racing, freestyle skiing, and snowboarding. The team competes in the United States Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association (USCSA).
This past season has been the club’s most successful so far. The women’s alpine team had accomplishments such as finishing second in the Allegheny Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Conference (ACSC) and receiving fourth at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Championships.
The men’s alpine team had similar accomplishments, as it finished fourth in the ACSC and finished eighth at the Mid-Atlantic Regionals.
Individually on the women’s team, first-year Anna Cederquist finished seventh All-Conference A-team in the ACSC, while junior Daria Bojko finished third All-Conference B-team. As for the men, junior Paul Kimball finished seventh All-Conference for snowboarding.
The men’s and women’s freestyle teams made a strong standing at the Mid-Atlantic Regionals. This was the first year the region included freestyle skiing. Master’s student Maryanna Saenko finished first and Cederquist finished third, leading the women’s freestyle team to a first-place finish. On the men’s side, senior Ben Streeter led the men to a second-place finish with his second-place individual placement.
Both the men’s and women’s freestyle teams qualified for the USCSA National Championship, which took place March 8–12 in Sun Valley, Idaho. Carnegie Mellon was represented by Saenko, junior Katie Dickson, Streeter, senior Jeff Bizzak, and junior Jeremy Slovak at nationals. 
The women took fourth place in skier cross, fourth place in slope style, and third place in half pipe, earning them third place overall; Saenko and Dickson were both recognized as second-team All-Americans. The men placed fifth in skier cross and fifth overall; Streeter was recognized as second-team All-American as well.
The Ski and Snowboard team is always looking for new members for the upcoming season, and welcomes experienced skiers and snowboarders with any interest in competing. If you are interested in joining, or would like more information, contact Katie Dickson at kdickson@.

The Tartans golf team competed at the Hershey Country Club in the Mid-Atlantic Regional on Sunday, April 3 and Monday, April 4.
The Tartans found themselves in third place after the first round of play — five strokes behind the competition leader — the University of Rochester, with a team score of 320.
Leading the way for Carnegie Mellon were junior Terence Einhorn and first-year Ian Bangor, who were tied for first among all competitors after day one with a score of 77, along with three others. Senior Brent Driscoll scored 82 after day one, closely followed by junior Michael Cheng, who carded an 84. Lastly, first-year Matt Wilson scored a 94 for the Tartans.
After day one, the top five schools were Rochester (315), McDaniel College (319), Carnegie Mellon (320), and a tie for fourth between Manhattanville College (326) and Franklin & Marshall.
The Tartans nearly mirrored their first-day score of 320 on the second day, carding a 322 to place fifth in the tournament.
Einhorn and Bangor led the way for Carnegie Mellon yet again, scoring 77 and 81, respectively, on day two. This put Einhorn in a tie for third place individually with a score of 154. Bangor finished 11th, scoring 158.
Driscoll fired an 80 on day two, giving him a score of 162. Cheng carded another 84 on day two, and Wilson finished the competition with a score of 194. 
“We shot pretty consistently between the two days, but the teams that beat us were able to improve on their day ones,” said Wilson. “The team is happy with the way we played, but seeing Rochester win made me a little uneasy.” 
Rochester taking first was bitter for the Tartans, as they are University Athletic Association conference rivals. With team scores of 315 and 312 each day, Rochester was able to surpass the entire field and win the tournament. Allegheny College, St. John Fisher College, and McDaniel College rounded out the top four, with Carnegie Mellon tied with Washington & Jefferson for fifth.

This May, a team of three Carnegie Mellon students will participate in the world finals of the IBM-sponsored Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), also known as the Battle of Brains. These students are among around 300 out of 97,000 students to advance all the way to world finals, 0.3 percent of the original pool of contestants.
The contest began over 30 years ago, held at Texas A&M and hosted by the Alpha Chapter of the UPE Computer Science Honor Society, starting out as a much lower-scale contest than what it is today. Doug Heintzman, IBM sponsorship executive for the ACM ICPC, explained that the contest was a friendly, relatively low-key competition between mostly North American schools for the first 20 years or so. “Then it kind of blew up into what it is today, with some 2,000 different schools from about 90 countries.... It has morphed from being the experimental thing 20 years ago to being this global, international, very large-scale phenomenon,” he said.
The rules and procedures of the contest are as follows: Every participating team consists of three students, and they are given between eight and 10 problems to complete in five hours or less. Each team is only allowed one computer to work on, which is provided by the organizers of the contest. 
Tom Conerly, a senior computer science major and member of the Carnegie Mellon team participating in the upcoming world finals, explained that people would normally check how well their code is working by running it, but because each team only has one computer, a different strategy is taken. “One person’s typing on one half of the screen, and on the other half of the screen another person is staring at the code trying to figure out why it’s not working,” Conerly explained.
The questions that the teams must solve range in difficulty, and involve coming up with a solution that will work over a range of scenarios. For example, a problem may ask for the minimum amount of fencing needed to enclose a certain number of trees. But the teams may not know the position of the trees or how many of them there are. The judging uses various “test cases,” which are different combinations of tree numbers and positions, to test how universal a team’s solution to the problem is. 
Once the problems are submitted for judging, they are judged as either “correct” or “incorrect”; the solution either works for all test cases, or it does not. There is no partial credit. There is also a time penalty if teams submit a solution after the five-hour limit. The team that solves the most problems in the fewest number of attempts in the least amount of total time is deemed the winner.
Conerly will be competing in the world finals with fellow student-teammates Nate Barshay and Si Young Oh, all of whom are also majoring in computer science. This year, the world finals are being held in Orlando, Fla. at the Peabody Orlando Hotel and Conference Center. Originally, Cairo, Egypt was slated as the host city, but due to Egypt’s recent uprising and social unrest, the world finals were moved to Orlando. 
The coach of the Carnegie Mellon team, Danny Sleator, a professor in the computer science department, helps organize practices that take up at least 10 hours a week. 
“This is like quiz bowl, except I think this is somewhat more substantial, because you really have to do something more creative and with more depth to it than answering a question about some vice president in the 1800s or something,” Sleator said. “Sometimes you have to create a new way of doing something. You have to invent new ideas that you’ve never heard of before.”
Though IBM does use the contest as one source of recruiting (the top-12 finishers receive a full-time job offer), Heintzman reflected on the more altruistic reasons the contest is held. “There are lots of really big problems [in the world] that are going to require some really clever problem solvers that know how to not only use but develop the state-of-the-art information,” he explained. 
“We think it’s very important to shine a very bright light ... and tell the story of how remarkable these young people are, and the responsibilities that are going to be sitting on their shoulders as they enter the workforce and start participating and solving some of these big challenges.”

On Monday, April 4, Fritjof Capra, author of best-selling The Tao of Physics and The Turning Point: Science, Society, and the Rising Culture, shared his views with the Carnegie Mellon community on a better future. Capra is an internationally acclaimed physicist and leader in systems thinking.
Capra gave a stimulating talk on his vision of a future which is based on his interdisciplinary ideas and choices. He said that the greatest challenge in our lives is currently to build and nurture “sustainable communities.” This might be achieved by using ecological sustainability, which, he explained, consists of “social, cultural, and physical environments in which we can satisfy our needs and aspirations without diminishing the chances of future generations.”
According to Capra, one of the major ways we can achieve ecological sustainability is by being “systems thinkers.” He defines systems thinking as “thinking in terms of relationships, patterns, and context.” It is a different way of looking at things with the key being that the whole is more than the sum of its parts. Instead of quantity, one looks at quality, mapping instead of measuring, relationships instead of objects, and so on. This approach ensures that we look at the universe as a large concept map, lines connecting anything and everything. It makes sure we look at great theories such as evolution as a cooperative entity in which we are all connected in a network.
Capra argued the importance of ecosystems — how they play a major role in sustaining life and how human civilizations have ignored them since the Industrial Revolution. We need to understand the systematic connections that form ecosystems to follow the task of designing sustainable entities in the future, he explained.
One of the major terms that Capra urged for all to understand and prepare with is ecological literacy, or ‘ecoliteracy.’ He explained that ecoliteracy is “the outstanding characteristic of our biosphere that has sustained it for billions of years.” This ecoliteracy is to be applied to ecological design or ‘ecodesign.’ 
In an interview with Ecotecture magazine, Capra explained that “design defined in an ecological perspective is the shaping of flows and energy of matter for human purposes.” There have already been many programs that have been implemented in Africa and South America that fall into the category of ecological design. One example is organic farming, because farmers use technology based on ecological principles and genetic engineering to promote healing and benefit the environment. Capra also advocates shifting from a product-based view to a more service-based or “flow” view.
This is also seen in green agriculture, which some members of the Carnegie Mellon community play a major role in. Green agriculture is seen in buildings designed to produce more energy than they use. Hybrid cars, hydrogen fuel cells, and anything that “serves” more than it “uses” can be labeled as ecodesign.
Capra advocates strongly that we need to shift to a more ecological-based society as we progress in the future. For example, he urges us to change from our chemical, large-scale agriculture to organic, small scale, community-based farming. Capra argues that this will solve one of our biggest problems: reducing our energy dependence. Second, organically grown food will improve our health, and third, organic farming will impact our ecosystems for the better.
Using a blend of systems thinking and ecological design, Capra recommends we take this into consideration in each of our quests to create a sustainable future. Whether it be through science or design, we need to implement a systemic view of ecological systems in order to improve a new era that is just beginning.

The sounds of carpentry filling the air and late-night buggy practices blocking the streets behind Hunt can only mean one thing: Carnival is just around the corner. While most people are busy preparing their booths or practicing pushing, there is also a small subset of people preparing for another event unique to Carnival, the 17th Annual Mobot Races. Challengers can enter their autonomous vehicles (“MObile roBOTs”) to race on a painted 400-foot course outside of Wean Hall, with prizes up to $1000 for the fastest mobot. Junior electrical and computer engineering major Kwabena Agyeman explained how mobots work. “It’s really just a mathematical [process]; running the robot along the course is just watching control theory in action,” he said.
The Mobot course consists of a painted white line two inches wide, and several “gates” or markers, which the mobot must pass through en route to the finish line. The course itself starts off with only a few curves and turns, but the end consists of several sharp curves and “decision points,” where the mobot must decide which version of the path to continue along. 
There is also a four-minute time limit for each race. Each mobot will be allowed to race twice. Although human control is not allowed once the races begin, the official website states, “Animals (except primates) may be used to assist with vehicle control as long as such use is humane (does not harm the animal in any way) and conforms with applicable University regulations.”
A basic mobot requires several components to work: wheels, a sensing mechanism for the course line, a controller board, motors, and a power source which may vary from AAA batteries to a rechargeable lithium battery. The mobot is controlled by various algorithms that control the motors and sensing mechanisms. The wheels must be durable enough to traverse over different sidewalk textures, crevices, dirt, and travel up and downhill. Agyeman’s mobot has a central rear wheel called an omni wheel, which can move smoothly in all directions, not just forward or backward. 
As for the autonomous portion of the mobot, every line of code is typed by hand. “How do I communicate to this motor? How do I communicate to this sensor? You have to figure that out yourself at the lowest level,” Agyeman explained. He uses a proportional integral derivative (PID) algorithm to help control for possible errors that his mobot may make. The sensing mechanism he uses returns eight data points, with different values to account for different colors of the sidewalk — the white race course stripe will return a lower value than the gray portions of the track. The controlling board will then adjust the path of the mobot accordingly to keep the white values “centered” on the race line. The PID will calculate the errors and integrate other values to keep the mobot on track. 
Another issue mobot builders must keep in mind is controlling for the hill portions of the race — how does one keep the mobot speed constant? Too fast will give the mobot less time to calculate how to steer the wheels in the next few seconds, but too slow will hamper overall time.
Agyeman has devoted 100–200 hours over the past two years to building his mobot, named “Stingray,” which can drive six feet per second at full power. While intellectually satisfying, the costs of parts for a mobot can run up to almost $1000, depending on the quality. For students who join the Robotics Club, many of the parts are subsidized. 
For Agyeman however, participating in the Mobot Races is only part of the fulfillment he gets from such an experience. “The whole point of [mobot building] is to see something move through your own effort. If you don’t take the time to do all of this yourself, then you’ve missed the learning opportunity. This is a good way of applying what you have learned.”
He added, “I wanted to do something with robotics, so I started working on mobots. My goal in college is to learn as much as possible in college as fast as I can, because once you enter the real world you rely on just what you know and get stuck in your ways. I’ve learned a lot from this.”
The Mobot Races will start at noon this Friday.

New technique makes healthier cheese
Currently yogurt is the most common delivery vehicle for probiotics, or bacteria which symbiotically benefit the intestinal health of the host. However, Portuguese researchers have developed a technique to easily monitor the composition of cheese as it ripens using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). This new technique may allow for healthy bacteria to be safely incorporated into cheese in the future, thus avoiding protein degradation in the new cheeses.

Unknown particle detected by Fermilab’s Tevatron
Fermilab’s Tevatron particle accelerator in Illinois detected a particle of unknown origin last week. The particle may not fit the Standard Model, which describes particle physicists’ best guess at how all of the elementary particles in the physical world interact.If the particle is proven to be real, it may turn the current understanding of particle physics on its side. Physicists say that there is a 1:1000 chance that the detection of the particle was a statistical fluke, giving them confidence that it was real, but opening up many questions as to its source.

New evaluation of strawberry evolution
A new variety of strawberry has had its genome sequenced this year. This new sequencing data of the woodland strawberry, Frageria vesca, provides the opportunity to analyze the evolution of the domestically cultivated strawberry, Frageria ananassa. Analysis of the woodland strawberry also indicates that the assignment of strawberries to the Frageria class may be incorrect and that an assignment to the Populus class might be more applicable.

Smartphones may improve public transit
Boston and San Francisco commuters participated in a study that involved giving up their cars for a week in favor of traveling by public transit. The study found that having real-time information about transit schedules, delays, and stops made the participants significantly more likely to utilize the public transit system. These results are anticipated to catch the attention of transportation planners and programmers alike to increase the ridership of mass transit options and take more individual automobiles off the road.

Pennsylvania calls for more water-quality testing
In response to a letter from the Environmental Protection Agency to the state, Pennsylvania environmental regulators are calling for an increase in water quality testing to assess whether radioactive pollutants and other contaminants from Marcellus Shale drilling are affecting the state’s rivers and other bodies of water. This involves adding radium, uranium, and a few other previously unconsidered pollutants to the list of contaminants tested for, and increasing the frequency of tests.

Icelandic genetics expose gene for sick sinus syndrome
The genotype of over 38,000 Icelanders has been evaluated to show prevalence of a gene that can lead to increased susceptibility of sick sinus syndrome, which is a serious heart rhythm disorder. The research shows that a single mutation in the gene MYH6 can lead to a change in the structure of a protein. The risk of being diagnosed with sick sinus syndrome increases from 6 percent for patients without the mutation to 50 percent for patients with the mutation.

Assistant teaching professor of English Yona Harvey introduced Steve Fellner, a poet visiting last Thursday as part of the Adamson Visiting Writers Series, by describing the characters in his poems as “not mild mannered misters, but contradictory tricksters.” This description may be well suited to the man himself.
Steve Fellner welcomed the audience to come closer to hear him read selections from his first book of poems, Blind Date With Cavafy, as well as newer poems that will likely be included in his second book of poems, Harlem Globetrotters, due sometime in June. He started out the discussion by stressing that he would stick to the schedule — he didn’t want to bore the audience with his poems. It was soon apparent that the audience was in no danger of getting bored.
He started out with a poem from Blind Date titled “Synesthesia.” His performance of the poem stood out immediately because of his dramatic pauses and enthusiastic delivery, which emphasized the humor in his writing. He introduced his next poem by talking about his life in Salt Lake City, and how, despite appearances, it has a flourishing gay community as well as an abundancy of crystal meth. He warned the audience never to get into meth, because it completely “messes up your gums.” His second poem, “I am Known as Walt Whitman,” discussed his experience with online dating — with Walt Whitman as his alias — and was a drastic change in tone from his first, with visceral sexual imagery and a tragic narrative.
After discussing his writing process for a bit, he began to joke about his views on Matthew Shepard, as well as his experiences as a (oftentimes hypocritical) teacher and his outdated attire. He mentioned that he once hoped to become a gay role model but quickly became disillusioned; he felt that the depiction of Matthew Shepard as an angel was something that he couldn’t relate with. He went into two poems about Shepard. “Shoelaces” talked about the oddity of Shepard being tied up with his own shoelaces by his murderers, and branched into his wishes of being a father and tying his children’s shoes. “Ode to Matt” talked about the desire for revenge.
During and after the reading, Fellner was eager to discuss his writing with the audience. The questions began with his interest in movies and science fiction, including his opinion on Jake Gyllenhaal and his fear of his soul being taken away as in Invasion of the Bodysnatchers (which he references in “Capgras Delusion”). He also brought up how he encouraged his students to embrace and reinvent tropes, and the advantage of exploring other worlds to escape from our own.
Fellner discussed his writing process, and how with his latest book he has been forced to write at least one poem per day in order to build up to the good poems. His editing process, he explained, usually consists of small changes and a thumbs up or thumbs down from his partner. He mentioned that instead of trying to revise his poems, he often just starts over entirely from scratch.
His final poem, “Love Poem For Phil,” was the result of his partner insisting that he write a love poem. He highlighted the use of exclamation marks after “egads” and “peace” that he put in for his partner; he claimed to hate exclamations because men who use exclamation marks are weak. The poem was a charming and lighthearted conclusion to a refreshing reading.

Next to Normal, the Tony Award- and Pulitzer Prize-winning rock musical, revolves around the Goodman family as it struggles against the effects of mental illness, drug abuse, ethics, the cons of psychiatric therapy, and themes of loss and acceptance. Last week, the show ran at the Benedum Theater starring the original cast.
The musical is divided into two acts, all dealing with scenes of domesticity and psychiatric therapy. Act I begins when suburban mother Diana Goodman (Alice Ripley) waits up late for her son, Gabe (Curt Hansen), who has been out past his curfew. She attempts to comfort her anxious daughter, Natalie (Emma Hunton), about school. Her husband, Dan (Asa Somers), gets ready for the day and they sing “Just Another Day.” The scene takes an unsettling and bizarre turn when Diana leaves sandwiches all over the table, the chairs, and the floor, calling it lunch.
The rest of the play deals with Diana’s illness and treatment. Her illness is revealed to be a 16-year-old case of bipolar disorder with hallucinations, triggered by the loss of a child. Medications only rob her of all feeling, psychotherapy is ineffective, and she attempts suicide. As a final resort, she receives electroconvulsive therapy, causing her to lose her memory in the process. The musical ends with Diana leaving her family, concluding that “some cuts are too deep.” She tells Dan that his support keeps her from learning how to get up on her own. Dan, heartbroken, is left depressed in need of therapy himself.
The stage was gorgeous. The set was divided into four floors, almost like boxes, and each floor served as a different locations. During Diana’s psychotherapy sessions, the front façade of her home, on the second and third floor, became an image of her face. This changed the set to be her entire psyche. Although somewhat minimalist in nature, the set was interesting and engaging.
The cast, for the most part, was phenomenal. Asa Somers in particular stood out with the strongest voice. However, it was unsettling to listen to a cast sing with upbeat voices about horrible things. The score wasn’t particularly impressive, and none of the songs left a lasting impression. However, the cast sang well and the acting was solid on the part of all cast members. Curt Hansen in particular made a great, ominous Gabe, his movements almost reflecting a dark ballet.
Unfortunately, Alice Ripley, although a Tony-winning singer for her role as Diana, had a terrible voice. Online reviews reveal that people have noted a recent change in her voice for the worse. In comparison to the official soundtrack, Diana’s voice was completely different; in the soundtrack, her voice was melodious and she could enunciate words. At the show, her voice was hoarse, and her words were sometimes indecipherable. It is rumored that her voice has been damaged, but if Alice Ripley has decided to make a character change, it was a horrible decision.
The biggest disappointment was that, although this was a Tony- and Pulitzer-winning musical, it fell short on many levels. Instead of delving deep into the truth of mental illness, the show only seemed to reflect the common misperceptions about what living with someone with mental illness must be like.
To be sure, certain medications can cause some people to feel strange side effects. However, Diana was hallucinating. Her hallucinations were not small; they were pervasive and completely delusional. Such cases only benefit from medication, despite the minor side effects. Furthermore, the side effects that Diana expresses in “I Miss the Mountains” would probably not be applicable to someone with her condition.
In addition, the musical ended with Diana leaving her family, and nothing was fixed. Dan’s character was such a refreshing hero. He remained a loyal and supportive husband for 16 years. There are scarce examples of positive husbands in modern literature. He did every possible thing someone could do to fix a problem, yet was in the end indirectly blamed. Diana leaves to live with her grandparents, and we can only assume that now this elderly couple must chase their daughter around the house to take the knives out of her hands.
Human flaws and mental illnesses exist. However, it should be an artistic imperative to express the reality of mental illness and treatment. The truth is, Next to Normal was more successful in expressing the misconceptions and misinformation surrounding mental illness than revealing the reality. To be fair, its flaws are probably something only people experienced with mental illness will be able to recognize. Next to Normal was overall an enjoyable show, but the viewer should keep in mind that its depiction of mental illness is not completely factual.

For the first time in nine years, Explosions in the Sky, a band originating from Austin, Texas, returned to Pittsburgh to play at the recently opened Stage AE. Fans and critics alike hail the band as one of the seminal bands in 21st century post-rock, but the band rejects this label, claiming to be solely a rock band. The band is comprised of three guitarists and a drummer ­— with one of the members occasionally switching to bass in the studio and a touring bassist when performing live ­— and it plays long, introspective, and emotionally evocative music. While it is easy to understand how this argument is ongoing when listening to the band’s studio work, its live performance is undeniable proof that it is indeed a rock band.
The Octopus Project, also hailing from Austin, Texas, opened up the night with a 45-minute set of mostly instrumental electronic pop. Each member of the four-piece band switched different instruments, which included the traditional drums, guitar, and bass in addition to samplers, glockenspiel, and theremin. They played with boundless energy and tried to involve the audience as much as possible. At one point, Josh Lambert, primary guitarist of the band, announced that “three hours from now we’re all going to get in a time machine and go back a year and a half in time and write this song” before the band played “Glass Jungle,” the highlight of the set.
After a short break, Explosions in the Sky came on stage, and the differences between the two bands could not have been more pronounced. Whereas The Octopus Project did all it could to fill the stage with its presence, using an assortment of neon cables for their samplers, neon-painted amps, and a projector screen playing various animations in the background, Explosions in the Sky seemed content with only the minimal equipment necessary — its only decoration was a single Texas flag draped over one of the amps. Guitarist Munaf Rayani quickly thanked The Octopus Project and introduced the band before playing “The Only Moment We Were Alone.”
The crowd’s reaction was immediate. While concert-goers seemed to enjoy the quirky indietronica of The Octopus Project, they were ecstatic once Explosions started to play. The audience was shouting, headbanging, and jumping around as the band seamlessly played through its set, until the opening notes of “Last Known Surroundings,” the first song performed off the group’s new album, began to resonate throughout the venue. Besides some head bobbing, motion ceased as fans absorbed the new material with rapt attention. Then, as if nothing had happened, the crowd erupted into motion once the band began playing “Birth and Death of the Day.”
This cycle of crazed enthusiasm during old songs and intense focus during new material continued throughout the night. All the while, the musicians seemed enveloped within their own world, choosing not to acknowledge the audience at all throughout their entire set. Even though they were on stage in front of hundreds of people, the musicians may as well have been playing in a basement in the middle of nowhere. However, fans were content with this because they, too, were immersed in their own worlds as they absorbed the simple yet emotionally overwhelming music.
Explosions in the Sky ended the night with a heartfelt preformance of “Greet Death” off the band’s second album Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Die, Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Live Forever. One by one fans began taking out their lighters and holding them up to the stage, which was illuminated only by a constant red light. What has since become one of the greatest cliches in concert culture did not diminish the power of Explosions’ performance. If anything, the act only added to the reverential and contemplative atmosphere that had settled in Stage AE.
Afterward, Rayani once again took the microphone and thanked the crowd before the band departed, the lights turned on, and filler music began pumping out through the speakers. While some clamored for an encore, most of the audience members realized that there was no calling the band back to the stage. The members of Explosion in the Sky performed a set, as promised, but would do no more. Leaving that venue, there was no doubting that every person in that room had been changed by that performance. There would be no way to ever recapture the emotional intensity of that performance, but the memory would remain, albeit gradually fading into a memory of a memory as fans exited into the cold dark night.

After five full-length albums and several EPs, Stephen Wilkinson has continued his ongoing project, Bibio, with Warp Records and released its sixth full-length album, Mind Brokeh. Wilkinson, originally from West Midlands, England, studied sonic arts and experimental during his time at Middlesex University in London. After graduation, he pursued his career as a music producer and began recording his own music under Mush Records, and later, Warp Records.
Wilkinson’s Bibio project has seen a fair share of success. That being said, there have been many ups and down in his discography career. Wilkinson’s newest album, Mind Brokeh, is a solid demonstration of the musician’s incredible production and mixing skills as well as his ability to create a detailed and comprehensive collage of sound. Still, Mind Brokeh doesn’t quite live up to Bibio’s most popular and arguably strongest album, Ambivalence Avenue. Although Mind Brokeh is no less adventuresome than Ambivalence Avenue, the album’s sound doesn’t quite flow as easily as that of the former album. The transitions between genres and song forms are often clumsy, causing the album to stumble in many places.
The song “Wake Up” embodies the majority of what listeners loved about Ambivalence Avenue. The song sounds forlorn at times; the grafted vocal samples, wiry loops, and insistent beats work together to create a feel of desperation. The song “Pretentious” is an example of some of the less favorable features of the album. The third song on the album, “Pretentious” causes an unnecessary break in the flow of the album, further emphasizing the ways in which Wilkinson has moved out of his comfort zone.
“Take Off Your Shirt” features an incredibly catchy guitar riff as well as spectacular vocals. Out of all the songs on this album, it is one of the most catchy and yet seemingly mainstream. “K is for Kelson” is extremely electronically oriented and bouncy. The album’s title track, “Mind Brokeh,” is a charming ambient tune equipped with soft bells and a looming cloudy apparition. It is unclear as to why Wilkinson chose to name the album after this track as it is one of the slowest and calmest songs on the album and does not aptly describe or represent the album as a whole.
If you have ever been a fan of Bibio, be sure to download this album. Despite the album’s inability to adequately compare with Ambivalence Avenue, it’s important to recognize that not many albums can. The songs on Mind Brokeh are well-constructed, short, and straight to the point. The album still contains the majority of the musical aspects that have made listeners adore Bibio over the years and it is great that this accomplished artist is pushing himself to try new things.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
It’ll be my first Carnival this week. What’s the big deal? Why is everyone so excited about it?
Thanks,
The Excitement’s Palpable, I’m Disturbed
Dear TEPID,
Ah, Carnival, that magical time of year when Carnegie Mellon becomes a normal college. For the first time in six months, the sun is shining, it’s warm out, and people have smiles on their faces. Classes are canceled for half the week — and some teachers cancel a few more days. The Morewood parking lot is shut down and filled with booths — wooden structures with some games added in at the last minute.
Then there’s Buggy, where fraternities get to spend two minutes doing what they’ve spent hours practicing for, starting at 4 a.m., every Saturday morning. It’s the closest Carnegie Mellon has to a sporting event that anyone cares about. There are mobots — tiny robots students build to compete in a race. You get to watch 99 percent of them fail miserably. Plus, there are plays, lectures, musical shows, comedians, and more.
Everyone looks forward to Carnival. It’s so good that the University of Pittsburgh copied it and tried to show us up by having one last week.
Don’t forget the fireworks,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
How am I supposed to concentrate in class when it’s so nice outside?
Sincerely,
Stuck Inside Despite Everything
Dear SIDE,
Don’t. For the first time in six months, it’s beautiful outside. Step away from your computer, put that pencil down, and grab a Frisbee. Go outside and have some fun for a half hour. Skip a class or two and have fun — just make sure you don’t accidentally skip a test.
The first week it’s nice is the most surreal moment at Carnegie Mellon. Everyone is outside and happy, and there’s a sense of camaraderie. It’s like being in a movie about college life. You get to laugh at how uncoordinated everyone is when you watch a few CS majors tossing around a Frisbee. You can go outside without a coat. It’s a magical time of year at Carnegie Mellon.
But eventually, all of that passes. There are still many more people out there than before, but the moment’s passed. Embrace it while you can. Knowing Pittsburgh, it’ll be snowing/raining/overcast in a matter of days. Plus, exams are just a few weeks away.
Ditch class,
Brian Hoskins

At first glance, Yelle seems like a quaint, seemingly-vapid-yet-gorgeous-skinny-French-Euro-Electro-Pop princess that rocks the airwaves, clubs, and computer speakers on both sides of the Atlantic. If you didn’t look too hard, your cultural conditioning would have you believe that Yelle was nothing more than another young woman being foisted onto the pop music pedestal by a crew of producers and marketers.
The truth is far from that. Yelle is actually a band, a partnership between singer Yelle (Julie Budet), drummer GrandMarnier (Jean François Perrier), and keyboardist Tepr (Tanguy Destable). The three have toured extensively, taking their live act to festivals and clubs across the globe, and have just put out their newest LP, Safari Disco Club (UMG’s Barclay Records).
I’m happy to say that Safari Disco Club is an incredibly robust sophomore effort. The instrumentation is as diverse as the emotional tenor of the entire album. Compared to the electro-pop pastiche Pop Up, whose songs were created to be used as singles, Safari Disco Club has been in the works for over two years and that effort is evident when listening.
The members of Yelle proudly love mainstream music Safari Disco Club reflects that passion for mainstream pop, in that it reveals a refined process of breaking down and reinterpreting standard pop tropes.
Budet’s voice, never straining, works wonderfully with the melodic and synth based richness of Tanguy’s keyboards. This makes for an extensive, interesting album, a result of a seemingly even partnership with her two producer bandmates.
If you like Chromeo, Daft Punk, Oh Land!, Cassius, Crookers, New Order, Robyn, Justice, or well wrought and astoundingly produced ’80s inspired electro-pop, this album has plenty in store for you. Safari Disco Club is being released this spring (in two weeks), so be sure to keep your eyes and ears peeled for it!

100 YEARS AGO
April 19, 1911
Three Tech students appear in this week’s Tartan for having taken a 200-mile car trip from Pittsburgh to Lock Haven, Pa. The article calls the travel time of 22 hours and 40 minutes “remarkably good.” At one point, the car, stuck in mud up to its hubcaps, had to be coaxed free by tearing down a nearby fence to put underneath it.

April 12, 1961
A lengthy editorial in this week’s issue disparages the “pre-1920 attitude concerning women students” prevailing on campus. The writer, however, proves the point only too well: Students in engineering, science, and fine arts are referred to as “women,” but those in the Margaret Morrison College are consistently “girls.”

The Tartan and the Fence both announce that Carnegie Mellon students will get a free concert sponsored by MTV. The show comes as first prize in a fundraiser for multiple sclerosis. So what did the University of Pittsburgh have to do to get Ke$ha last Sunday?

Architect Mack Scogin comes to campus to unveil the design for the planned Gates Center for Computer Science and the smaller building, “Donor X,” attached to it. “You can’t make the mistake of something too modest, too small,” Scogin says in his speech. That sounds like we should have had a nine-floor Helix.

Not even a new building makes everyone happy. The Crime & Incident column includes a report from an annoyed worker in the Gates Hillman Complex that music from the Cut could be heard inside his office. He “requested that it be turned down so that he could work.” Must have been a computer science grad student.

At this very moment there are at least 30 million humans being trafficked around in the world — more than during the height of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, according to the Not For Sale Campaign. An average slave in the American South in 1850 cost the equivalent of $40,000 in today’s money; today a sex slave costs an average of $90, according to the Free the Slaves project.
While most human sex slaves are sold in South Asian countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal, the impact of modern slavery is not felt only overseas. According to a conservative estimate by the U.S. government, between 14,500 and 17,500 human slaves are trafficked into the United States per year; the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children estimates that at least 100,000 American minors are the victims of commercial sexual trafficking and prostitution each year.
This semester a group of Carnegie Mellon students has gathered evidence that suggests sex slaves are being exploited in Pittsburgh. The students have approached Pittsburgh City Council asking for a new city ordinance that could regulate one major form of human trafficking in Pittsburgh out of business. The Polaris Project defines those who seek out massage parlors selling sex as ‘Johns.’ According to their website, “ ‘Johns’ who frequent brothels disguised as massage parlors make it a ‘hobby’ to buy sex and to track all massage parlors nationwide. There are more than 5,000 brothels disguised as massage parlors nationwide.”
“John’s boards” are websites where people rate and explicitly describe commercial sex. Using these sites, Jessica Dickinson Goodman, a senior ethics, history, and public policy major, and Ismail Smith-Wade-El, a senior humanities and arts major, found at least 15 Asian massage parlor establishments (AMPs) in Allegheny County that appear to sell sex. One of these establishments, which is advertised on the Adult section of backpage.com, is directly across the street from the Giant Eagle on Murray Avenue where many Carnegie Mellon students buy their groceries.
Goodman, a former member of the Polaris Project, stressed that not all AMPs sell sex. “[We are targeting] massage parlors which are brothels that have trafficking and are pretending to be massage parlors.... I think this ordinance is good for legitimate masseuses because it means they will no longer have to compete with fake masseuses and no longer have people coming in expecting sex.” Goodman also explained that an establishment soliciting commercial sex does not necessarily practice human trafficking, but that it is at a high risk of trafficking, which is characterized by force, fraud, and coercion.
Goodman submitted a model ordinance to Councilman Doug Shields that would require Pittsburgh massage parlors to be licensed to operate. This model ordinance, drafted in part by the Polaris Project, would place operational requirements on the massage parlors such as restricted hours of operation, prohibition of indecent conduct, required registration of massage practitioners, and non-obstruction of windows with things such as paint, paper, or plywood.
Goodman and Smith-Wade-El have teamed up with representatives from Carnegie Mellon International Justice Mission (IJM), Amnesty International, Life Matters, and Heinz International Development Group, as well as Pittsburgh’s Project to End Human Trafficking to advocate for those whom they believe to be trapped in sex slavery. They have organized a letter-writing campaign to the nine City Council members, with a goal of 500 letters urging the passage of a massage parlor regulatory ordinance. Councilman Shields is expected to introduce this model ordinance to City Council this Tuesday.
Smith-Wade-El has helped to gather evidence and has done footwork for the letter writing campaign. He first learned about modern slavery, or human trafficking, through involvement in his high school theater group and involvement with Free the Slaves. “We had the opportunity to meet with trafficked persons, and their stories really touched my life.... It made me think of all the things I’m lucky to have and all the things I take for granted — even if it’s just as simple as being able to walk out my door in the morning when I want to.”
“Knowing is half the battle ... once people become more aware [of human trafficking] they will start to fight and stand up to eradicate this issue,” said Jaime Turek, assistant director of the Project to End Human Trafficking in Pittsburgh. Turek has been actively supporting the Carnegie Mellon student activists’ initiative. “It is my hope that we can see this through together to the very end,” said Turek.
Amy Badiani, a senior international relations and politics major, is associated with both Amnesty International and the International Development Group. Badiani said that she is involved with the letter-writing campaign to “make a change locally in Pittsburgh that has a global impact.”
Emily Kennedy, a junior ethics, history, and public policy major, helped start a chapter of International Justice Mission at Carnegie Mellon. Kennedy said that her faith plays a big role in her involvement in the campaign. “I think that the God of the Bible does care about seeking justice for the oppressed.... He commands us not to sit around and be complacent but to act.” 
Both Kennedy and Badiani said that a serious injustice is committed against men and women who agree to come to the U.S. seeking opportunity, but instead find themselves trapped in networks of human trafficking. 
“The goal is to eliminate this particular form of sex trafficking from Pittsburgh and Allegheny County by regulating it out of existence,” said Goodman. “Hopefully this will make it easier for Harrisburg to pass a comprehensive criminal approach to sex trafficking.... In addition to a fine and being shut down, people who are selling other people for sex who don’t want to be sold — human traffickers — will be thrown in jail.”
UPDATE 4/17/11: In a statement received by The Tartan, an individual speaking as the owner of the AMP identified on Murray denied Goodman's allegations. He stated, "We have measures in all of our operations that tightly control the activities of our therapists and explicitly prevent any sexual contact or other illegal activity whatsoever."
Goodman and others will be tabling for their letter-writing campaign this Wednesday from 11:30–3:30 p.m. in Wean Commons in the University Center. They encourage the campus community to stop by to read the model AMP ordinance and to write a letter to City Council representatives.

In an attempt to adapt to a growing online market, The New York Times newspaper is now requiring users pay for subscriptions for unlimited access to online articles at nytimes.com while simultaneously offering students and faculty members at certain universities a 50 percent discount on subscriptions. 
As of last Saturday, Carnegie Mellon students can have unlimited access to The New York Times’ website for $1.88 per week, billed at $7.50 every four weeks. Students who do not purchase digital subscriptions can still access up to 20 articles per month for free.
“According to a semiannual study of national newspaper readership by the Student Monitor, the Times reaches nearly one in five (18%) U.S. college students during a typical week, which is a much larger percentage than any other American newspaper. It also found that NYTimes.com reaches better than one in five (22%) college students in a typical week,” said Carnegie Mellon Vice President of Corporate Communications Eileen Murphy via e-mail.
Coincidentally, 85 percent of the undergraduate voters (comprising 20 percent of Carnegie Mellon undergraduates) voted last week to continue Carnegie Mellon’s Collegiate Readership Program, which gives students access to a variety of print newspapers, including The New York Times. The program is paid for out of the $5-per-semester media fee.
The New York Times is offering discounts to Carnegie Mellon students and faculty because the university purchases a qualifying amount of hard copies for its college readership program.
“_The New York Times_ has a longstanding tradition of offering educational discounts and working with colleges and universities on utilization of The Times in their teaching,” Murphy said. “Offering discounted digital subscription rates to students and others at these colleges and universities is a natural outgrowth of that program.”
However, there are some who predict that only a few students will take advantage of the discount. 
“They’ve likely already figured out a way to bypass the protections that The Times has put up,” said adjunct assistant professor of English Tom O’Boyle. 
In addition to The New York Times giving certain leniencies to articles accessed through search engines like Google, students can also access for free the most recent issue of The New York Times through Hunt Library’s online articles database.
However, O’Boyle believes that few students will even reach the 20 article limit, “While the Internet is undoubtedly where most students get their news and info, I’d imagine that places like Facebook and news aggregators such as Google news are far bigger sources than The New York Times web site.”
“I probably only read The New York Times online once this month,” said sophomore business administration major Evan Hollins. “We already get [hard copy versions of] The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and other papers for free.”
However, The New York Times’ digital subscription model is structured so that the few students who do read the website more often and choose to subscribe will help support free access by other students. 
“The few who care may be able to justify the expenditure by telling themselves it will be less than what they spend on lattes for the year,” said special faculty instructor in English Mark Roth. “[But] most students will not be hurt by the new limitations on free articles.”
“What matters is, how can you attract a sizable group of core readers who are loyal to your news brand and get most of them — not all of them — to pay for access? And that’s the core of the new business,” said Ken Doctor, an analyst who studies the economics of the newspaper business, as quoted in_ The New York Times_.
The move to digital subscriptions in general represents how newspaper companies are struggling to remain profitable in a market where consumers are used to receiving things for free online. “Media companies have to find ways to monetize their content. Providing such content to the public costs media companies enormously, but the public — and the aggregators — are not providing fair compensation to the people who source that content, who provide that content,” said O’Boyle.
Although many free websites can rely on advertisement revenue generated by site visits, The New York Times has not seen a proportional increase in site visits relative to the investment the company has made into its content. 
Nevertheless, advertisement revenue still makes up a significant percentage of total revenue, and Roth stresses how The New York Times must be wary of how digital subscriptions will decrease site visits. 
“I think the big debate on The Times’ decision is whether the revenue benefits of going to a paid site will be more than offset by a total decline in online readers and by a decline in online advertising, which is based on page views,” said Roth. “I am not sure the equation will work out to The Times’ advantage.”

More than three weeks have passed since Japan was struck by an earthquake and tsunami that also started an ongoing nuclear crisis. However, to exacerbate the country’s problems, a series of small earthquakes of various magnitudes have since erupted in Japan. The impact of the first quake and following tsunamis was massive, razing homes to the ground and killing thousands of citizens. 
Presently, Japan is in need of tremendous support and aid from the world. Carnegie Mellon students have already begun making efforts to aid the country. Student organizations have been raising money in several novel, yet successful ways.
The International Student Union (ISU) organized a series of soccer matches at Gesling Stadium to gather funds for the Japan disaster at the beginning of the month. Puja Agarwal, a sophomore information systems and human- computer interaction major, spoke about the idea behind the fundraiser, as well as the reaction and support the ISU received from students. Agarwal, along with the rest of the ISU board, put up posters across dorms and academic buildings announcing the soccer matches. The posters read, “Are you a fan? Come show your madness — Support Japan.”
The fundraiser involved having as many teams participate as possible, with each team consisting of seven to nine players. Every player on the participating teams contributed $45. 
“We knew that everyone enjoyed soccer, and we thought that this would be a fun way to raise money,” Agarwal said. Six teams came out to play, accompanied by many viewers. In addition to hosting the matches, the ISU board sold popcorn to the bystanders and those enjoying the match.
“We kept the rules pretty simple. Teams competed one by one against each other in set groups, and the winners of each match went forward to the next match, against another winning team,” said Agarwal. It was clear that both the participants and organizers kept donations as the priority, giving less importance to who would be the referees or who the ultimate winner would be. Agarwal claimed that “the best part of the event was seeing the crowd and teams play on a Friday night for this cause.”
The money raised by ISU will go to Carnegie Mellon’s Japanese Student Association; the money raised collectively by the two organizations will then be dispatched to Japan.
The student body was not the only group that came out to support Japan. Faculty members, staff, and administrators also showed their sympathy and support, with professors holding events and donating money. Professor William C. Messner from the department of mechanical engineering announced that he would donate money for every student who got his or her hair spray-dyed at the campus event “Different Color Hair Day.”
Last Wednesday, mechanical engineering students tabled outside Wean and Doherty Hall with hair sprays in various colors — from hot pink to neon green to sparkling silver. Depending on the number of participants who got their hair colored and signed a sheet, Messner donated up to $2 toward tsunami relief on behalf of each participant. The event had many students standing in line to get their hair sprayed, showing the students’ unity in support for Japan. Students Krystina Teoh and Guillermo Gomez, senior and junior mechanical engineering majors, respectively tabled outside Doherty Hall and convinced many reluctant students to get their hair sprayed, assuring them that the colors were not permanent. 
“Messner holds an event of this kind nearly every year, except that last time it was for Haiti,” Teoh said.
Carnegie Mellon’s dining halls have set up boxes asking students to donate their spare change for earthquake relief. 
Joshua Yee, a first-year mechanical engineering major who got his hair sprayed during Messner’s event, was extremely pleased with Carnegie Mellon’s efforts to raise money for Japan. “A lot of student organizations are holding events and collecting money to support Japan,” he said. “I sincerely hope that these efforts continue.”

David Chickering, housefellow of Mudge House dormitory and a resident of Beeler Street, is heavily involved with a rising group, the Beeler Street Association. The main goals of the group are to increase safety on the street, unify the residents, and relieve tension between those who live on Beeler and those who host parties on it.
“The Beeler Street Association is an opening for residents and students to talk.... We want to enable them to have more positive interactions with each other,” explained Chickering. “The forum used to be tighter; we are trying to take it back to the way it was before.”
Meetings for the association are held periodically throughout the academic year, with discussions about street expectations, traffic, pedestrian safety, vandalism, and destructive behavior on the street.
The group is promoting a dialogue between all key stakeholders. City representatives often attend meetings to address traffic and pedestrian safety issues, as well as housing codes. Staff members from the university’s Student Life Office participate to understand neighborhood concerns and to help bring residents and students together. 
Staff members further extend their efforts by taking measures to increase unity, such as going door-to-door with Carnegie Mellon Police to talk with residents.
This objective is important to the university, Chickering said. “There is a delicate balance for university students and [permanent] residents. Carnegie Mellon students need to represent Carnegie Mellon well.”
Many students agree with this stance and support Chickering’s intentions. Mohit Moondra, a junior dual math and economics major who resides on Beeler, said, “It is important for students and non-college residents to get along and have mutual understanding and respect for each other. There definitely needs to be more interactions between them.”
However, Chickering said, “Communication is complicated because it is challenging to account for all students. We try to use flyers and mailing lists to the extent possible though.”
This struggle in communication leaves room for improvement in the group’s efforts as some student residents feel out of the loop. “If such an association is really for both permanent residents and students, then why have I never been approached about it or asked to attend [meetings]? They know I live here too,” said Murphy Bug, a sophomore social and decision sciences major.
Students who are able to participate in the new association find it to have positive effects. 
Vidhi Luthra, a senior business administration major who is a resident of Beeler, expressed, “I am really glad to have gone to meetings and introduced myself to people living on the street that are not students. I have come to understand their point of view on how the street is treated because of the many college students living there, and feel like more people would benefit from hearing their side of the story.”
In addition to participating in the Beeler Street Association, Chickering is also responsible for acting as a liaison between students and permanent residents on Beeler, “I will talk to houses that get complaints, and more generally act as a friendly face that people can talk to. My role also includes listening to the issues of residents.”
This includes taking measures so that communications run smoothly during Carnival weekend. 
“I will be sending a letter to everyone on Beeler discussing Carnival. It is done as a way for the university to work with students, encouraging them to be responsible and conscientious of noise and trash during Carnival. It also provides contact information for residents that have complaints during the weekend.”
“The primary thing for Carnival is to stay respectful of boundaries and keep things indoors,” Moondra said.
Chickering is confident in the ability of students and residents to coexist in a friendly manner as he plans events to bring them together, such as Beeler Street block parties and barbecues, which will encourage neighbors to meet each other.

CAUSE group hosts its first conference on black power
Leaders from around the world gathered to discuss their cutting-edge research in transnational African-American history at the “Black Power Beyond Borders” conference. The event was hosted by Carnegie Mellon’s Center for African-American Urban Studies and the Economy (CAUSE) last weekend in Baker Hall’s Giant Eagle Auditorium.
“One of the objectives of CAUSE is to facilitate research in new areas, and that is what we aim to do at this conference by helping to internationalize black history,” said CAUSE Director Joe Trotter, the Giant Eagle professor of history and social justice.  
Presenters at the conference included keynote speaker Barbara Ransby, professor of history and African-American studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago; Kevin Gaines, professor of history at the University of Michigan; Yohuru Williams, associate professor of African-American history at Fairfield University; and Robbie Shilliam, a senior lecturer at Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand.
The conference’s main goal was to expand people’s knowledge of the black power movement geographically, chronologically, and thematically. Moreover, the conference aimed to investigate the multiple meanings of black power within America. Historians have only begun to further study and investigate the black power movement.
‘Anti-Gravity Great Downhill Race’ returns for Carnival
The “Anti-Gravity Great Downhill Race” returns to campus for Spring Carnival and will be held next Monday, April 18, at 4:30 p.m. on the Cut in front of Doherty Hall. The event will be dually hosted by the School of Art and the 2010 Kraus visiting professor of art, Pat Oleszko.
The race, featuring individual as well as group entries from the College of Fine Arts, is free and open to the public. 
This year’s race will be organized by students enrolled in the School of Art’s “Altering the Existing” class. This hands-on course teaches students to deconstruct and  transform the function of existing objects in order to create unconventional sculptural works. 
The art students include Zahra Ahmed, a senior; Zena Ruiz, a fifth-year senior; juniors Tara Helfer, Steven Mentzer, Julia Cahill, Natalia Gomez, and Allison Gozion; and sophomores Emily Wobb, Mirrie Choi, and Laura Westover. 
The mobiles and machines that the students build will trundle down the Cut during the race event. Bystanders are warned that crashes, explosions, and feats of magic are to be expected.
“You can be a triumphant tortoise — on a roll. Our only rule is that you leave your engines at home and let Auntie Gravity do her voodoo ... doo,” Oleszko said.

Rayvon Fouché Lecture
Wednesday, April 13 at 4 p.m.
Newell-Simon Hall 1305
Rayvon Fouché will speak on “Merckx and the Machine: Governing Bodies, Banned Technologies, and the Future of Sport.” 
Eddy Merckx set the record for longest distance bicycled in an hour in 1972, on a standard bicycle. Years later, his record would be broken on a non-traditional bicycle, specifically developed to assist in such a feat. But in 1996, all records since Merckx’s were wiped, and it was required that record-seekers make their attempts on traditional bicycles. 
Fouché will discuss the way governing bodies in sports have reacted to technologies that enhance athletes’ accomplishments.
Fouché is an associate professor of history and research associate professor of the Information Trust Institute of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. His work explores the intersections of cultural representation, racial identification, and technological use.

Spring Carnival is here, and the campus is anxiously awaiting a four-day weekend. Carnival is a time of rides, games, Buggy, Booth, deep frying foods, and other traditional events. Let’s look at some facts about Spring Carnival’s beloved traditions:
35: top-recorded speed of a Buggy in miles per hour
33.99: fastest-recorded mobot course completion time, in seconds
92: years that buggy has been a campus event
1950: the year Booth became competitive

A full sixth of the Carnegie Mellon student population cast a ballot in last week’s student government elections. 
A 1,700-student turnout would be considered abysmal by most metrics, but by Carnegie Mellon standards it represents quite an improvement over the nadir of 2007, when barely 1,000 students voted in an election plagued by procedural and technical malfunctions. This year, we feel more confident that the final tallies in races for student body president and vice president, vice president for organizations, and vice president for finance express the will of the electorate — at least to the extent that the electorate here has a will in the first place.
It is a different case, however, in the Undergraduate Student Senate. Once again, persistent lack of interest in student government ensured that we had more open Senate seats than candidates willing to fill them. 
The voting results are laughable. Four seats in the College of Fine Arts were won with two votes each. It was possible to get into Senate from the Carnegie Institute of Technology, the Tepper School of Business, and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences with five votes or fewer. The sole standout is the Mellon College of Science, where — judging by the vote tallies — all five Senate seats went to candidates who had actually campaigned for them.
If a successful Senate campaign consists of asking your three closest friends for a write-in vote the night before the election, it may be time to re-examine the process of becoming a candidate. 
According to official student government documents, a Student Senate candidate wishing to appear on the ballot in April must gather signatures of at least 25 students from his or her college in February, then attend a “mandatory” candidate information session. With more than half of this year’s Senate seats going to write-in candidates, it seems many students have decided that these rules and procedures are unnecessary. 
We agree, at least, that the system is broken somewhere.We also question how dedicated these write-in winners will be in fulfilling their newly acquired duties as Student Senators: Deciding to run for elected office on a whim does not strike us as the best guarantee of continued interest for a full school year. Given the do-nothing attitude of this year’s student government in general, we desperately need an incoming class of leaders ready to effect meaningful change in the way Carnegie Mellon students view their elected representatives. Right now, it is unclear whether the next year will be any better than the last.
Editor’s Note: Meela Dudley is a Student Senator-elect and as such was recused from this article.

“Women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized.”
A Toronto policeman uttered this ludicrous statement in January while giving a safety talk to college students at York University. Since then, students from the university have organized a large protest aptly called “Slutwalk” to reappropriate and redefine the word “slut.” And I say more power to them!
I’m glad these students didn’t brush aside this statement and instead saw the underlying problems within our society that it exemplified. Women may have equal rights now, but sexism and misogyny still exist and heavily influence the thoughts and actions of many people. The statement made by that Toronto policeman might have been meant to help women stay safe, but the underlying logic of it suggests that he thinks women are, in a way, asking to be victimized by dressing in a provocative way.
I’m sorry to burst your bubble, Mr. Policeman, but no one asks to be victimized.
People like this policeman may think that dressing conservatively decreases a woman’s risk of being raped, but think about it: She can take self-defense classes; she can walk home with a friend when it gets late; she can keep her cell phone handy; she can buy mace. How she is dressed is not a deciding factor in whether or not she is raped. It is a well-known and well-proven fact that rape isn’t about how hot or slutty a girl looks; it’s about opportunity and power.
In case you weren’t listening, I’ll re-emphasize: Rape is about opportunity and the power the rapist has over his victim.
To demonstrate my point, let me illustrate a hypothetical situation. A rapist is lying in wait for a victim and sees three girls walking by. Two hot girls are dressed in slutty clubbing clothes and turn left while the third girl, who is kind of homely, is dressed normally and turns right. Who do you think he’ll go after? The third girl, of course, because she’s alone and there is a greater opportunity for success. So honestly, when one thinks about it, how a girl dresses has nothing to do with whether or not she will be victimized.
Victim-blaming in these ways is a serious issue, one made even more serious when those who are meant to protect citizens practice it. To take another example from Toronto: There was a case in 1986 in which a rapist was targeting women in a certain neighborhood. The police, however, did not believe the first two women who claimed they had been raped because one had a boyfriend and the other related her rape in a calm and relaxed manner.
By the time the third Jane Doe, who kept her name a secret throughout her 11-year legal battle, was raped, the police had made a conscious decision not to warn the women in the neighborhood so that they could catch the rapist red-handed. Poor Jane Doe was nothing more than bait for the rapist. What a travesty that the very entity created to protect and defend citizens failed to do so because of victim-blaming and sexism.
As a citizen, I would hope — even demand — that the police do everything in their power to protect me. As a woman, I would expect the right to walk down a street dressed as I choose without judgment from the law. Granted, I know I can’t go out naked without getting pulled over for public indecency, but wearing a tight dress shouldn’t mean that I as a person am indecent.
If I wear a slutty dress, yeah, it probably means I’m looking to get some. Women dress attractively because we want to attract attention — of the consensual kind. Blaming women for wanting to look attractive is like blaming a shopkeeper for putting some of his best wares on display. Is he asking for a break-in? Of course not! What it comes down to is respect. Respect for a woman as a person, with the right to make decisions about the clothes she puts on and who she takes them off for, free of labels like “slut” or “whore.”

In the late hours of Friday night, Congressional leaders announced to the American people that they had reached an agreement to fund the government, avoiding the shutdown that would otherwise have begun at midnight. President Barack Obama, Speaker of the House John Boehner, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid hailed the agreement as a compromise that took each side’s interests into account. 
They portrayed their last-minute accord as responsible governance. A New York Times headline stated that “Both Parties Claim Success in Averting a Shutdown.”In spite of this positive spin, we view Congress’ behavior over the last several months, and the last week in particular, as absurd. Politicians are trying to take their abject failure to govern and sell it as saving the government in its hour of need. The United States government is now operating under its seventh continuing resolution of the year pending the passage of a full budget this week. Funding the federal government is not a matter of making convenient compromises between parties. It is a constitutional responsibility of elected representatives to make the best budget possible, a job that they have thus far neglected.
In the end, the compromise reached last Friday will cut overall spending by $38 billion out of a multi-trillion-dollar budget. Included in the deal is a $5 billion increase in Pentagon spending for the year, according to the Times. 
Spending cuts are essential in order to reduce America’s deficit — and ultimately the national debt — but not at the expense of putting hundreds of thousands of employees on furlough. Any increase in spending should not go to the defense budget, but should be distributed to programs for public radio and arts endowments, which are in dire need of funding.
The budget fights over the last few months have, more than anything, shown the Orwellian hypocrisy of our divided government. Democrats and Republicans blame each other for failing to compromise while refusing to give ground on the smallest of issues. 
Perversely, last December’s lame-duck Congress accomplished more than the current government has in the last three months. 
Congress’ budgeting fights are far from over — and once the 2011 budget is passed, the bickering over next year’s spending will begin. We hope that politicians have learned from last week’s debacle. However, we fear that the squabbles will continue, embarrassing not only our government but the United States as a whole.

As an alumnus, I have fond memories of Spring Carnival and, in particular, Booth. I was never part of a fraternity, so Booth gave me an opportunity to work with other members of an organization to build something great that would be enjoyed by hundreds of visitors. Booth gave me an opportunity to meet alumni and general Pittsburgh residents. Booth was collaborative, spontaneous, and open. Booth was fun. However, as Carnegie Mellon becomes increasingly paranoid and restrictions are added to the process, I worry that bureaucracy is destroying much of what Booth is at its core.
Last year, I arrived on campus and headed to the Morewood parking lot only to find that I had to sign a waiver and wear a wristband to be allowed on Midway. The process wasn’t too painful. However, the new requirement seemed a little contrary to the openness and collaboration fostered by Booth in the past. If I had been a student instead of an alumnus, having to sign a legal document and wear a wristband for the week also would have been a potential deterrent from participating at all.
This year, the university has instituted an additional deterrent: mandatory university-issued hardhats. This is not to say that hardhats in general are a bad idea — there could certainly be more safety equipment in use by organizations — just that it seems like a badly implemented knee-jerk reaction to a problem that doesn’t exist. Students would be better served by training programs to increase safety knowledge. As it stands, the new requirements do little to actually protect students and increase their safety, and seem to serve little purpose other than to make the university more comfortable from a legal standpoint. Even so, if the goal was to limit its legal liability, requirements on top of the waiver are pointless overreactions and only serve to discourage students from participating in Booth. Current student Josh Watzman put it best when he said, “The recent string of introductions of legal barriers in order to allow a person to work on Booth is ridiculous. I’m worried that it is going to kill Booth as we know it....”
Additionally, neither the waivers nor hardhats are effective in protecting random people wandering onto Midway. There are never signs warning of the potential dangers. I have seen people walk with their small children into booths filled with power tools and exposed wiring and nails. Wristbands or not, there will always be random people wandering around booth construction. It seems that, rather than make Booth more difficult for people who want to participate, the university should be making the risks and dangers clearer for all involved. In general, the new requirements for working on Booth represent a disturbing trend toward limiting access and making Booth an event for a few instead of an activity for all.

Over the past few weeks, University President Jared Cohon and student government President-elect Jake Flittner have both talked about addressing transportation around Pittsburgh, which is increasingly becoming a concern to the campus community. The Port Authority’s recent 15 percent service cuts are making travel to school, the grocery store, and other places difficult for students, faculty, staff, and the city at large who depend on public transportation services. We think it is extremely important that the leaders at the university continue to address this issue.
Students at Carnegie Mellon are required to pay a Port Authority fee every semester, which automatically invests each student in the services that Port Authority provides. This semester, each student paid $46 for use of the city’s bus services. While we feel that this fee is currently justified because we can recoup the cost of our bus pass within 15 trips, cuts to the bus service may begin to infringe on its convenience. Since first-year students are prohibited by campus policy from having a car on campus, and most other students do not have a car because of parking expenses, it seems that most students are dependent on the Port Authority buses as their main transportation option.
Cohon, in an open forum with staff three weeks ago, relayed that he was personally working with Port Authority to ensure continued service around Carnegie Mellon’s campus. In particular, he mentioned that he was focusing on peak travel times, including eastbound transit on Forbes Avenue on weekday afternoons. If cuts to Port Authority routes around campus continue, Cohon said he would even consider increasing shuttle service during peak hours.
Given the current economic state and a history of Port Authority cuts, it seems likely that Carnegie Mellon students will see a drop in the service around campus, rather than the hoped-for increase. Without additional funding, bus routes will continue to be combined or removed, and the buses on each route will become more sparse. As Cohon stated in his address to faculty and staff, public transportation cannot survive unless it is subsidized. We believe that Cohon has the correct perspective; Pittsburgh’s public transportation needs additional support. Carnegie Mellon’s student body can do little more than show the administration that transportation is an issue the students care about. However, student support might be enough to make a substantial change.

Terry Jones, a fundamentalist pastor in Florida, burned the Qur’an on March 20. He staged a mock trial for the holy book, in which it was found guilty of what he described as crimes against humanity. Members of a “jury” heard arguments from both a prosecutor and a defender before they sentenced it to death by execution. The entire group then burned the Qur’an, executing it for its “crimes.”
Jones, along with his group of extremists, is an idiot.
Originally, Jones was going to burn the Qur’an last Sept. 11 as a protest against the terrorist attacks. This garnered a huge backlash of anger and dissent, as well as media attention — what Jones probably wanted most. However, because of the controversy, he decided against it and didn’t go through with his plan.And yet, despite a promise to be rational months ago, Jones burned the holy book. The act went unnoticed in the United States for the most part, but it ignited protests in Afghanistan and Pakistan. According to United Nations officials, thousands of protesters overran the compound of the United Nations in a northern Afghan city and killed at least 12 people. The protesters sought revenge, and when they didn’t immediately get any, innocent bystanders paid the price.
Jones and his troupe of fundamentalist evangelicals’ thoughtless actions had dire consequences. His stupid mock trial led to the death of at least 12 people. He preaches the word of God and demands that people live in the way of the Lord, yet he purposefully creates situations knowing full well that people will get hurt as a result. As an adult, Jones should be aware that his actions will have consequences; the more severe the action, the worse the consequence. Despite this logic, Jones still burned a whole religion’s holy book. He disgraced the religion and practically spit in all Muslims’ faces.
“It is not that we burn the Qur’an with some type of vindictive motive,” Jones said in an attempt to rationalize his actions. “We do not even burn it with great pleasure or any pleasure at all. We burn it because we feel a deep obligation to stay with the court system of America. The court system of America does not allow convicted criminals to go free. And that is why we feel obligated to do this.”
He does not understand that he cannot take the law into his own hands; he cannot dole out punishment and justice against what he deems to be “crimes.” He has no right to make that kind of judgment call. 
He needs to understand that he doesn’t have the right to mess with something sacred to entire nations. Muslims are just as religiously devout to the Qur’an as he is to the Bible. His hypocrisy astounds me. He claims to be a devoted man of God, yet he condemns those who, in my opinion, worship the same God.Instead of burning their holy book, he should try to reach out to Muslims and strive to understand the subtle nuances between his religion and their religion. He needs to work on bridging gaps instead of promoting religious factionalism.

This week your wisdom and life experiences will hit you full in the face even though you won’t be thinking about them. Don’t be afraid; it is a good thing and will help you put your life into perspective.
I don’t care how late you are to class every day, but you can’t use your buggy as an everyday means of transportation.
Don’t lower your standards in life. You should seek out the best, but if what you seek are higher standards for the weather in Pittsburgh, then lower your standards quickly in order to avoid lots of sadness.
Throw the books aside and enjoy Spring Carnival. Yes, you have lots of work to do, but things will be worse for you if you don’t enjoy yourself for a day or so this week.
At the Carnival concert this year, be inspired by the passion in the crowd and jump on stage to perform with Big Boi. The lawsuit and restraining order will be well worth it.
Hopefully it never comes to this, but take comfort in knowing that if a natural disaster were to hit, your campus organization is well equipped to build temporary structures until the National Guard arrives.
Note that your booth-building hardhat is for Midway only. Please don’t wear it to class next week.
Whatever you do, don’t blow your top over Buggy. No matter what happens, there will always be next season.
Mistakes can be corrected if you put enough effort into fixing them. The first step to correcting your mistakes is to forgive yourself. After that things will be much better.
Look at the paper, now look up, now back at your paper. You just spent unnecessary time looking around. Look down, now look up. You are standing in the middle of the Cut. How the heck did you get there?
Mind your “p”s and “q”s this week. There are alumni visiting, and you never know who just might be your boss one day. Oh, and because being polite is the proper thing to do.
Please: For your safety and the safety of others, don’t eat more than three funnel cakes this week.
