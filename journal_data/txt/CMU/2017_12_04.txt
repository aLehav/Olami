The men’s basketball team faced off against Allegheny College on Wednesday, Nov. 29, falling to the Gators 78–63. The Tartans’ record is now 3–2.
The Tartans struck first with a three-pointer by senior guard Ryan Maha. The teams traded baskets for the opening minutes of the game, with neither team dominating play. The Tartans went on a 6-0 run to pull ahead of the Gators 16–9. With seven minutes left to play in the half, sophomore guard Zach Howarth sunk a three-point shot to increase the Tartans’ lead to 27–17. However, the Gators slowly inched their way back, cutting the lead and tying the score at 31. They took the lead with three minutes left to play in the half, and led the Tartans 41–36 at the half.
Coming out of the half, the Tartans looked to find some of the momentum they had at the start of the game, but the Gators scored first to extend their lead. Down seven points, junior forward and center Patrick Ehland scored five straight points to cut the lead to two. In response, the Gators went on a 19–4 run over the next nine minutes of play to make the score 67–50. The Gators maintained their lead for the rest of the game, winning 78–63.
The Tartans committed fewer turnovers (10 to Allegheny’s 15) and scored more points off of turnovers (13 to 10), but shot only 37.1 percent from the field (compared to Allegheny’s 50.8 percent) and only scored 12 points off the bench (to Allegheny’s 25 points). Howarth led the team with 18 points, his season best. Ehland scored 14 points, 11 in the second half, and added seven rebounds.
The Tartans will next host the Juniata College Eagles on Monday, Dec. 4. The game is set for 7:30 p.m. at Skibo Gymnasium.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team suffered their first loss at their first home game of the season Wednesday night at the hands of the Capital University Crusaders. Despite a fourth quarter surge, this brings the Tartan’s record to 5–1.
The Crusaders dominated play in the first half, starting with 19 points in the first quarter, finishing off with a three-pointer at the buzzer. Carnegie Mellon matched Capital’s pace for the second quarter, but were unable to hold a lead, as Capital started the second quarter with a 15–0 run. The Tartans went on their own run immediately after, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the deficit, and the two teams went to the half 34–28.
Capital grabbed a double-digit lead in the third quarter, and held onto it for most of the quarter. It seemed as if the Tartans were beginning a comeback, pulling within eight points with 1:08 left in the quarter, but the Crusaders were able to score again and finished at the third quarter buzzer with 48 to the Tartan’s 38. The fourth started the Tartan’s heroic comeback attempt, bringing Carnegie Mellon to a one-point deficit with 2:50 left in the game. However, the Crusaders were able to get a five-point lead back, and despite another final push from the Tartans, the game ended 57–53.
The Tartans made 18 of their 53 field goal attempts, as well as collecting 41 rebounds and forcing 18 turnovers. They were sent to the free-throw line 21 times, and hit four three-pointers as a team.
First-year forward Kylie Huffman recorded her first career double-double, with 10 points and 13 rebounds. Sophomore forward Katharine Higgins led the team with 15 points in the game, and sophomore guard Makayla Filiere had the most assists for the game with three.
The Tartans play again on Thursday, Dec. 7, against Washington and Jefferson.

The final week of regular season play is upon us in fantasy football. While the season is not over yet, this will be my final recap, and my final article writing for The Tartan. It’s been a pleasure being part of this organization and being a part of Carnegie Mellon. The people here are extraordinary, and I have no doubt that many will be up to bigger and better things in the future. Alright, that’s enough sappiness. Let’s finish this.
Easy Breesy over Team Andah 165.4–129.3
While staffwriter Josh Andah has suffered some abysmal weeks due to his complete neglect of his team, he actually was the second highest scorer of Week 12. Too bad he had to face my team. Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones put up his best performance of the season for my team: 12 catches for 253 yards and two touchdowns, a total of 50.8 points. This more than offset the ten catch, 169 yard, two touchdown performance of Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown, who netted Andah 40.9 points. Our tight ends both had strong performances. Philadelphia Eagles tight end Zach Ertz earned Andah 26.3 points while New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski scored 25.2 points for me. 
The biggest difference maker was New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara, whose 87 rushing yards, 101 receiving yards, and two touchdowns gave me 36.8 points. Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson fought valiantly with 23.6 points, but the differences across the board did not come up in Andah’s favor.
Yes We Cam over Drop it like it’s Crock 96.7–94.3
This was an incredibly close game between Editor-in-Chief India Price and Publisher Jade Crockem. Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton scored 17.5 points for Price, and Indianapolis Colts tight end Jack Doyle came close behind with 16.4 points. Miami Dolphins wide receiver Jarvis Landry rounded out Price’s top three players with a 15 point performance. 
On Crockem’s side, Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Adam Thielen led the team with 16.9 points. Colts running back Frank Gore followed closely with a 15.9 point contribution. While the 6.4 points from Vikings running back Jerick McKinnon and the paltry three points from the Steelers defense almost led to Price’s defeat, Saints running back Mark Ingram’s 5.6 points and Panthers tight end Greg Olsen’s two points cost Crockem the chance at salvaging some lost pride.
Third String Team over Justin Tucker Must (not) Die 108.2–100.6
Assistant Sports Editor Marika Yang got the better of Contributing Editor Lula Beresford, cementing Yang’s no. 2 seed for the playoffs. Yang’s top player was a surprising pick: Cincinnati Bengals running back Joe Mixon. Mixon’s 114 rushing yards, 51 receiving yards and rushing touchdown earned 25.5 points for Yang. Patriots wide receiver Brandin Cooks followed suit with a 21.4 point performance, though there was a steep drop off to her next highest contributor, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith. 
On Beresford’s side, Steelers running back Le’Veon Bell had an incredibly strong 28.3 point showing. Patriots quarterback Tom Brady earned 20.7 points, as he had spread the ball out to far more than just Cooks. Unfortunately for Beresford, Washington Redskins tight end Vernon Davis had zeroes all across the board in his statistics, yielding no points at all when they were desperately needed.
As the final week of regular season play dawns, the playoff picture is still 75 percent uncertain. While Yang has managed to clinch the no. 2 seed, every other position is in play. 
The no. 1 and no. 3 seeds are between Price and myself. While I currently have the no. 1 seed due to having a one game advantage, Price could still take it and drop me to no. 3 if I lose against Crockem and she wins against Beresford. 
The no. 4 seed remains a tossup between Beresford and Andah, with Andah having the tie-breaker advantage. Beresford must beat Price this week and hope Andah falls to Yang to make it into the playoffs. Otherwise, the lack of attention Andah has given to this league will have paid off in the form of a trip to the playoffs, something that would really be a letdown among those of us who have been competing in the league. Here’s hoping Lula triumphs.

It’s no secret that the Pittsburgh Penguins aren’t seeing the same success at this point in the season as they have  the past two years. The back-to-back Stanley Cup champs are sitting at fourth in the Metropolitan division, sitting at 13–10–3. While not horrible, the Pens are certainly not playing at the same level that they were just a few months ago when they raised the cup, so what’s the problem with the defending champions?
The most glaring difference from last season is on the roster. Six different Penguins (guard Marc-Andre Fleury, center Nick Bonino, defenseman Trevor Daley, center Matt Cullen, left winger Chris Kunitz, and defenseman Ron Hainsey) left the Pens either as free agents or in the expansion draft and signed new contracts with different teams.
That’s a huge loss from the Pens bottom six offense, but general manager Jim Rutherford did his best to fill the holes, bringing in right winger Ryan Reaves of the St. Louis Blues, center Riley Sheahan from the Detroit Red Wings, and center Greg McKegg of the Florida Panthers to fill in the gaps left by Bonino, Cullen, and Kunitz.
Where the Pens really need help, even with Carter Rowney’s return from his hand injury, is at center. Another center in the lineup, especially one with a veteran presence who can score goals, would be invaluable. Sheahan still hasn’t been excellent at 3C Minor Hockey, and Rowney hasn’t proven himself to be able to score often.
Recently, rumors surrounding Pens defenseman Ian Cole being shopped have surfaced, and it leads one to wonder who the Penguins might be able to pick up in exchange for the shot blocking D-man. My eye is on center Tyler Bozak of the Maple Leafs. He’d be a significant upgrade from Sheahan at 3C, and would likely have good chemistry with former teammates right winger Phil Kessel and defenseman Matt Hunwick.
Head coach Mike Sullivan is vehemently denying any and all trade rumors, so maybe Penguins fans will not get another addition to the team right now. But who knows, Sullivan might just be trying to keep things quiet, as he’s been known to do.

Alexandra Dean’s new movie, Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story, documents Hedy Lamar’s life as an inventor. The movie claims that her beauty often stood in the way of her getting credit for her inventions. 
Hedy Lamarr (born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler) was an Austrian-born actress that was marketed by MGM to be the “most beautiful woman on screen.” Some of her most popular films are Samson and Delilah (1949), Algiers (1938), Ziegfeld Girl (1941), and Come Live With Me (1940). She was also infamous for her role in Gustav Machatý's 1933 film, Ecstasy, where she was shown orgasming and nude on screen. 
However, Hedy Lamarr not only shattered stereotypes in the film industry, she also was an inventor of technology that is still relevant today. Although she had no formal engineering education background, she worked with American aviation magnate Howard Hughes on an improved design for plane wings, and on a method of wireless communication with American pianist, composer and friend George Antheil. 
During World War II, the U.S. Navy used submarine’s radio controlled torpedoes to combat German U-Boats. However, these torpedoes could be detected and “jammed” by broadcasting at the same frequency as the torpedo, to veer the missile off-course. Lamarr and Antheil’s solution was to invent radio hopping — method that would allow the signals to be sent using random frequencies at short intervals. The specific code for the order of the sequence of frequencies would only be held by the controlling ship and the receiving torpedo. This was groundbreaking, and inspired by piano keys. A piano roll would decide the randomness of the frequencies. 
This invention was not taken seriously by the U.S. government which was increasingly skeptical of inventions from outside the military. In the movie, biographer Richard Rhodes said “The Navy basically told her, ‘You know, you’d be helping the war a lot more, little lady, if you got out and sold war bonds rather than sat around trying to invent.’”
It was only three decades later, in 1997, that Lamarr and Antheil were awarded the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Pioneer Award. Also in 1997, Lamarr became the first female to win the BULBIE™ Gnass Spirit of Achievement Award for her significant contributions to society with her creative lifetime achievements in the arts and sciences.
While the movie by Alexandra Dean manages to convey her underrepresented contributions to science, Vanity Fair’s review of the movie claims that “presenting her entirely as a victim oversimplifies the contradictions of a complex character whose vanity participated in her own stereotyping, and whose life decisions often seemed as dank as her intellect was supposedly bright.” Lamarr’s off-screen personality was tumultuous, with her first appearing to be disinterested in her looks and then, later in life, becoming nearly addicted to plastic surgery. Not to discredit her contributions, but only to recognize her as a less-than-composed woman one must question the state of her financial matters and her denial of her Jewish ethnicity. Taking her life into account, and her contributions as a trailblazer in film and in science, it is important to recognize her as a human, complex, flawed woman that worked despite all the odds against her.

Utah’s Great Salt Lake, an iconic 1700-square-mile natural feature that gives the state’s capital its name, is disappearing.
The lake contains about half of the water it did in 1847, and the water level is still dropping. In 2016, it hit its lowest point ever recorded. 
Researchers have confirmed that the lake’s present-day water level is not a natural variation of water levels over time: it is a direct consequence of human overuse of the lake’s resources. The lake’s desiccation is a result of a century and a half of diverting water away from the lake for agricultural use.
Large salt bodies of water all over the world are suffering from the same problem. The Aral Sea in Central Asia and Lake Urmia in Iran are some of the more-well known ones, but major salt lakes in places like Argentina, Australia, and Kenya are all drying up as well.
The desiccation of salt lakes has a huge environmental impact. Salt lakes are a crucial part of their local ecosystems. If the water level goes down, the remaining water gets saltier, and the increased salinity can kill off fish species if it gets too high. Salt lakes are also home to brine shrimp, small organisms that serve as important food for migratory birds who use salt lakes as a rest stop on their journey, or even as a nesting site. A decline in the brine shrimp population can cause bird populations to suffer.
When salt lakes disappear because of human activity, it’s not just wildlife that suffers: we’re also harming ourselves. Receding salt lakes leave behind swaths of incredibly dusty soil, which gets picked up by wind and dispersed into the air. 
The dust contributes to air pollution and increases local rates of asthma and other respiratory ailments that can be caused or agitated by pollution. Mitigating dust pollution around California’s Owens Lake, another retreating salt lake, is expected to cost the city of Los Angeles $3.6 billion. 
Receding salt lakes can also do great economic damage. The industries that directly mine the lake’s resources will suffer: companies that harvest salt from the lake or collect brine shrimp eggs (a surprisingly profitable industry) can’t stay in business if there’s no lake to harvest from. The tourism and recreation economy will also suffer: Activities like swimming and boating lose profit, and fishing and birdwatching become unrewardingly difficult or impossible. 
If the lake recedes so far that it no longer touches adjacent towns, it may become difficult just to access it.
The researchers who confirmed the Great Salt Lake’s desiccation hope that by recognizing that the problem is caused by humans and not natural variation in water levels, we will be able to accept our responsibility for sustainable water management and begin seriously working on solutions to the problem.

One   of the things that makes holidays simultaneously fun and stressful is gift-giving. Behavioral economists in Carnegie Mellon’s Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences have been studying the art of good gift selection and the disconnects that arise between the person choosing the gift and the person receiving the gift.
Behavioral economics is the interdisciplinary field of economics and psychology that aims to understand how people can be “predictably irrational” and factor human emotion and behavior in understanding how economic systems work. At Carnegie Mellon University, behavioral economists are looking to answer some very complex and important questions. They are studying the reasons behind our consumption of unhealthy food, better ways of non-abstinence based sex education, and gender discrimination in the workplace.
On studying what makes a gift a good gift, researchers found that projection bias and attribution bias have big roles to play in how we select the gifts that we do.
Projection bias is the cognitive process of overestimating how much other people agree with us, i.e., our own opinions of the gift interfering with what the other person might actually think of it. Simply put, just because a person likes Taylor Swift’s newest album and would be thrilled to get it as a record, doesn’t mean that they should purchase it for their uncle.
Attribution bias is a bias that exists because of our own inability to perceive things objectively. Kareem Haggag, an assistant professor in the Social and Decision Sciences Department explains, “Our work on attribution bias is about evaluations we make of past experiences with an item and, specifically, our failure to fully account for our temporary states — thirst, fatigue, etc. — that could have affected enjoyment. For example, if you happened to sample a restaurant when you were extremely hungry, you might later overrate it because you failed to account for just how important being extremely hungry played in that experience.”
With understanding these two biases comes the realization that we aren’t actually very good at knowing what our family and friends really want. Perhaps, giving them exactly what they asked for would be a more successful strategy.
Shereen J. Chaudhry (Dietrich College Class of 2013) wrote a dissertation with George Loewenstein — the Herbert A. Simon University Professor of Economics and Psychology in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences and co-founder of the field of behavioral economics for the Behavioral Decision Research Program titled — “Thanking, Apologizing, Bragging and Blaming: The Currency of Communication.” Chaudhry explains that the appreciation we received for a gift in the past is proportional to the time we spend on picking a gift the next holiday season. While it seems pretty normal to thank someone for their gift to you, the importance of expressing appreciation is vastly underrated in terms of establishing healthy relationships. 
She says, “with gift-giving, the desire is often to deepen the connection with and to impress the recipient, to show the recipient that the giver is a valuable partner or friend,” she continued, “though it may be difficult for some people to admit, this means that, in many, if not most, cases of gift-giving, our generous motives are mixed with self-interested motives. 
Rather than taking this as depressing news, realize that this highlights the importance thanking can have in maintaining and deepening relationships.”
Jeff Galak from the Tepper School of Business reveals that gift-givers are more focused on the immediate moment of gift-giving whereas gift-receivers are more interested in the long-term benefits of the gift. Galak, an associate professor in marketing explains, “we are seeing a mismatch between the thought processes and motivations of gift givers and recipients. Put another way, there may be times when the vacuum cleaner, a gift that is unlikely to wow most recipients when they open it on Christmas day, really ought to be at the top of the shopping list as it will be well used and liked for a long time.”

Love’s Labor’s Won started out the lost and rare sequel to Shakespeare’s comedic play Love’s Labor’s Lost, which tells the misadventures of four young noblemen who fall in love with four young noblewomen, and ends in the death of the King of France. In Scott Kaiser’s adaptation of this lost play, Kaiser decomposes Shakespeare’s fantastical romances into an organic yet still fantastical take on love that calls for analysis into its definition. The show was held in the Purnell Center of the Arts from Nov. 16-18 and Nov. 28-Dec. 2 at 2:00 p.m. on Saturdays and at 8:00 p.m. on all days for the entirety of its run.
Written and directed by the Director of Company Development at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, Love’s Labor’s Won sets itself in a post-war world, after the conclusion of a large-scale war similar to World War I. Four young noble men: Ferdinand, Dumaine, Berowne, and Longaville return to negotiate an armistice to end the European war that threatens to divide the kingdom of Navarre, over which Ferdinand reigns. Additionally, the four men also encounter their respective lovers, Princess Isabelle of France, her close friend, Katherine, Rosaline, and Maria once again. However, the eight characters unexpectedly find that the war has not only established a physical distance but an emotional distance between the close bonds they once shared.
Kaiser’s adaptations to the setting and atmosphere of Love’s Labor’s Won and its original play help to effectively portray his intent to examine the effects of a catastrophic war on an individual and the bonds that surround them. However, some of his execution and direction blunted the sharp delivery of what he sought to convey. While the acting was effective and incredibly relatable, possibly due to the personal nature of love in general, Kaiser’s adaptation could best be described as too out of place. While it seemed to want to offer a different dimension on love in a post-war-torn era, the play came off as a too-typical Elizabethan comedy, feeling as if it existed in a similar vein as Carnegie Mellon’s production of The Rover from last year, which I realize now was originally written in a completely different artistic period. While it seemed to want to pitch a new perspective on veterans and their post-war lifestyle, their view was limited and narrow, and it didn’t go as in depth as I hoped it would. In short, Kaiser’s adaptation felt very much like its setting: it felt very much like a classic Shakespeare play that the famous playwright himself would have written, but it didn’t carry over effectively into the present day and during this adaptation.
As a fellow fan of Shakespeare, for some reason I was a bit turned off by the rhyming language of the banter between the couples, and its frequency throughout. Maybe I’m just really bitter about love in general as of now, and the standard Shakespearean language did not resonate with me at this time. But while I applaud the text for maintaining an atmosphere of historical accuracy, I think it made the play’s more serious discussions too lighthearted for their subject matter. As a result, the language felt out of place and sometimes took me out of the mood. For the most part, during these moments I followed along for the sake of following along, rather than having a true investment in the story itself.
As previously mentioned, however, it was truly the acting of this show that stood out. Unlike the language of the play, the Shakespearean acting style of the nine actors involved help to truly set the mood and vibe of the play and enriched the story, making the World War I setting more interesting and intriguing. Their acting effectively combated the serious nature of World War I, and all nine actors gave a huge and fantastic breath of life to the characters they portrayed. Senior drama student Jordan Plutzer led the play off to a great start through his monologue as a physical embodiment of War at the start of the play, framing the motives and intentions of the play and setting up an interesting dynamic. In fact, I found sometimes that I wanted to hear more from War’s perspective as the events of the play progressed. Senior drama student Kyle Decker’s Longaville, a war prisoner accused of being a spy, perfectly played the voice of reason and the contrasted voice of hope among his battered friends, who he symbolized in his exchange with them in the second act. Decker’s performance is the most effective in conveying Kaiser’s intentions and messages, if not saying them verbatim, and his performance is a great representation of the entirety of Love’s Labor’s Won. Other standout performances include senior drama student Eleanor Pearson’s Maria, who carried her role as Princess Isabelle’s lady-in-waiting with perfect dignity and grace; and senior drama student Aubyn Heglie, who portrayed Rosaline with a great amount of empathy and relatability. Heglie’s Rosaline additionally closed out the play perfectly, and through her character arc, where she learns to open herself up and soften her heart, had a deeply personal touch that made her performance special.
Additionally Love’s Labor’s Won unexpectedly featured some musical talent. Senior drama students Christian Strange and Rayquila Durham, who played Berowne and Jaquenetta respectively, blew the audience away during both their casual and meaningful bursts into song. As a singer, Jaquenetta’s personal conflict between performing lighthearted songs and melancholy songs even served to convey a larger message, which I saw as fascinating and somewhat well-done.
This play, especially with its ending, somewhat forcibly yet smoothly creates a happy ending for all five couples involved, but Love’s Labor’s Won was still a memorable production that had a lot to say, if one looked hard enough. It may not be Carnegie Mellon University’s strongest play during their drama season, but Love’s Labor’s Won is still an incredibly memorable production with a tremendous amount of heart put into every step of the way.

My first time ever being exposed to K-Pop music and dance was when I attended last year’s K-Pop Dance Club (KPDC) Showcase: Checkmate. I remember having an amazing time, and I found all the music and dancing very entertaining. More than that, it introduced me to a whole new genre of possibilities. Going in last year, I didn’t expect that I would like K-Pop, but I surprised myself. Since then, my interest and fascination with K-Pop music have gradually grown, and I went into this year’s event, Paradise, full of excitement.
The location and setup for the showcase were pretty much the same as last year’s: it took place in the Cohon Center’s Rangos Ballroom and student organizations such as Carnegie Mellon’s Taiwanese Student Association (TSA), Korean American Students’ Association (KASA), and Awareness of Roots in Chinese Culture (ARCC) were at the front selling food. I noticed that there was a way bigger crowd this year. The seats were almost all filled when I got there, and my friends and I were lucky to find a spot. Even more, people continued to show up during the event, with a good mix of K-Pop lovers and those who knew little to nothing about the genre in the audience. The large numbers and liveliness of the crowd added to the excitement of watching the performances.
The showcase was hosted by KPDC president Alina Yu and one of the club’s dance directors Justin Yook. Their cheesy puns and paradise island-themed introductions helped create an enjoyable experience for the audience. There were twenty-two dance performances during the event, most of them by members of KPDC. However, there were several dances performed by members of KASA and the University of Pittsburgh’s Fresh Entertainment by Student Artists (FRESA). All the dances were covered or inspired by choreography from famous K-Pop groups such as BTS, SEVENTEEN, and Girls’ Generation. There was a good variety of performances, from hip-hop numbers to dances in the bubblegum pop genre. Despite the fact that all the songs and dances were new to me, I still felt the urge to (attempt to) sing and dance along.
In addition to the songs and dances being entertaining, the performances were also polished. Each dance group color-coordinated their outfits, with some being very sparkly and eye-catching and others very dark and in all black. Several dancers also dyed their hair and put on makeup to match their outfits.
Learning more about and experiencing the fun and animated aspects of the K-Pop culture made my time at the KPDC showcase very worthwhile. It was clear that the rest of the audience had as great a time as I did. All the hard work put into the event by the performers and club members certainly paid off, as the performances were impressive. Whether you have no idea what K-Pop is (Korean Pop, for those still wondering) or are just looking for some new songs and artists, KPDC’s talent and energy are sure to leave you looking forward to their next performance.

This past Friday, Earthly Delights by fine arts sophomores Coco Allred and Sydney Krantz opened at the Frame Gallery. You can see the show from the street, an otherworldly blue and purple glow coming from inside the gallery. Draped from the ceiling are Allred’s beautiful paper cutouts that cast shadows of blue, green, and purple light across the room. An enormous curtain of holographic material falls to the floor as a backdrop for the delicate paper installations. The holes evoke images under a microscope, like shaved bone or fungus. Creating cocoons and dividing up the flow of the gallery, this installation creates an interesting and undetermined pathway to explore the space. Along one wall are Krantz’s paintings, textured and swirling, mimicking the biological and bodily references of the installation.
Earthly Delights is a beautiful give and take between artist and audience. The artists have created a space that doesn’t offer a clear narrative, so the viewer gets to wander through space and project their own associations and stories on the landscape they have created. Playing with references to things big and small, these works “work” in their own way with the idea of the sublime.
In art history, the sublime refers to the sensation you would have in response to images of a violent storm or look over the edge of a cliff. It’s a kind of beauty that nature possesses that reminds you of how small you are and of the potential for great destruction and danger. Specifically, it was used to refer to one’s relationship to God of being so small in the presence of something so powerful and great.
Earthly Delights’ religious undertones are, of course, apparent in the title, but the pieces’ attempt to capture the sublime in abstracted, peaceful imagery takes more time to reveal. The show requires reflection. Although the installation catches the eye immediately, decoding the space and absorbing the paintings takes longer. The pinks and greens of the paintings swirl, like alien skyscapes or textures of a foreign surface under the dotted shadows of the installation — the viewer is transplanted into a fantastical world.
The opening reflected this intention, with small groups of individuals wandering around slowly and gathering in pockets within the paper installation. Whereas The Frame has seen openings with greater formality or rambunctious energy of viewers in audience, this show was reflective and quietly social. Although Allred and Kantz’s art is stunning, Earthly Delights is as much a place to be as things to see. I am itching, in the chaos of finals, to return to the gallery to slow down and take in this kind of beauty that feels so… well, unearthly.

One of Pittsburgh’s many neighborhoods, Squirrel Hill is a student hotspot for great food. It has a wide variety of choices in Asian cuisine, boasting Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and Indian restaurants, among others. Chengdu Gourmet, a Chinese restaurant, sits on Forward Avenue off Forbes Avenue. From campus, the 61C and 61D buses will take you all the way down to Forward. If you’re up for a walk, the 61A and 61B lines to Forbes and Murray Avenue work as well.
Outside, Chengdu Gourmet is bright yellow with a red trim, decorated with Chinese paper lanterns and multi-colored garlands. Inside, there is an open space that feeds into a larger room for diners. There are several booths running along one side of the room, small square tables, and larger circular tables arranged around the room.
Chengdu Gourmet has an extensive menu that caters to different customers. It has the classic Chinese-American dishes, General Tso’s Chicken and Triple Delight, as well as a few Thai choices, such as Pad Thai. If you’re in the mood to try something a little different — and more authentic — jump to the traditional Chinese menu, which offers several different kinds of pork, casseroles, and noodle soups.
Eating family style, my friend and I decided to order an appetizer, a vegetable entrée, and a meat entrée. Both entrées came with bowls of rice. The service was fast and efficient. The food was out not too long after we ordered, and the waiter walked past to check on us but didn’t intrude.
For the appetizer, we chose scallion pancakes, a staple in Chinese cuisine and something from our moms’ cooking that both of us craved. The scallion pancakes were wonderfully flaky, cooked with just enough oil, and went very well with the sweet soy sauce they came with. We could’ve ordered three more of them for our entire meal and would’ve been full and content.
The vegetable entrée we chose was dry sautéed green beans with minced pork. The green beans were very flavorful, the minced pork making a nice compliment. The green beans were slightly salty and soggy, but overall, they were a nice contrast to what we ended up choosing as out meal entrée.
The meat entrée of our choice was diced chicken with dried peppers Chongqing style. Food from Chongqing, a city in southwest China, is part of the broader Sichuan cuisine, which is known for bold flavors and spiciness. The chicken lived up to its name. The dried peppers gave the chicken a particularly numbing spiciness commonly found in Sichuan cuisine. However, the numbing spiciness overwhelmed all the other flavors from the chicken itself. I’m not the most tolerant of spicy foods, so I was constantly drinking water (which the waiter promptly refilled) and eating bites of green beans and rice after.
The appetizer and two dishes were more than enough for the two of us — we were absolutely stuffed after the meal. We chose Chengdu Gourmet because we wanted to try a new place in the area that served authentic Chinese food. For the most part, we weren’t disappointed. I’m excited to go again and try different dishes on the menu.

Hey Ruth,
So finals are coming up soon, as I’m sure everyone is aware, and I want to try and prevent something that always happens to me. Namely, I slack off.
Look, I spend the whole semester with my schedule absolutely jam-packed with classes and homework and extracurriculars. I can mostly keep to a schedule when that’s the case because I have to or I’ll fall behind on everything. But as soon as finals week and we actually get something resembling a reasonable amount of time to do things, I’m totally incapable of making myself do any work! I just procrastinate on studying for finals and writing essays because I can keep telling myself that I have all week to do everything, so I end up cramming at the last minute even though the only thing I’ve done for the past few days is binge TV and chill out with my friends. How do I motivate myself?
Seriously Lacking Any Class Knowledge. Over F****** Finals.
Dear SLACK OFF,
It has to be a law of reality that whenever you have basically no time to do your work you can finish it all really quickly but when you have all the time in the world it takes absolutely forever. Or at least, I hope so, because it happens to me all the time. I guess work, or at least the kind of work we have, is like gaseous matter that way — it fills up all the space given to it.
It sounds like you work very efficiently when you have a strict schedule, so my main point of advice is going to be that you make one for yourself. It doesn’t have to be a very full, terrible schedule where you study for eight hours every day, but if you block out a certain amount of time every day, based on how many finals and how much you need to study, of course, and follow that, then you’ll be in a better position than if you crammed the night before after a week of slacking off.
Of course, the key here is that you have to actually follow the schedule. I’m not sure about you, but part of what makes a schedule work for me is the threat of consequences if I don’t stick to it. For most of the semester the consequences are no sleep and failing my classes, but there’s something about the stretch of empty finals weekdays that makes all of those consequences seem so distant. Basically, you’ve got to build your own motivation.
There are two ways of doing this, I feel. Positive or negative reinforcement. Many people recommend setting up small rewards for completing a certain segment of the studying you have to do as an enticement to get it done. If this works for you, great! I’ll admit that I have the tendency of just giving myself the reward without doing any of the work, so it’s not usually the route I choose to take. No, when the fear of failure doesn’t quite do it for me, I turn toward another method of motivation. I find a friend who I like (and ideally don’t want to disappoint) and tell them to bother me at a certain time about whether or not I’ve done the work I said I would. Usually, the knowledge that someone else is keeping tabs on the work I need to do is enough to get me set up and rolling. At least until the next day.
There’s no point in my pretending that I know the perfect way to study (as much as I wish I did), but there’s one main thing I’ve found helpful the past six finals weeks I’ve been through. Basically? Take breaks. Big breaks to hang out with your friends, little breaks to stretch and get the blood flowing, and especially medium-sized breaks to acquire food. The only thing wearing yourself out will do is make it harder to focus when you actually sit down for your finals. Trust me. 
Also, not to advocate for subpar work, but if you’ve done the calculations and know you only need, for example, a 70 percent for the grade you need in the class, then there’s no shame in adjusting your effort accordingly.
Finals week is notorious for being exhausting, but it doesn’t have to be the absolute worst. The fact that you’re already planning is a good sign.
Happy finals,
Ruth

After days of cramming and somehow simultaneously having too much and not enough sleep, you had to drag yourself out of bed this morning at an ungodly hour for an 8:30 a.m. final.
As you hand in your exam and stagger out of the lecture hall you have only one thought in your mind: boozy brunch. Whether you’re looking for celebratory bottomless Mimosas or to drown your sorrows with a custom made Bloody Mary, we’ve got your pre-noon alcohol needs covered with this week’s bar, The Yard.
The location: Located just off Walnut St., with its plethora of food, drink, and procrastination options, The Yard is an easy walk from campus and an even easier bus ride on any 71 bus. A lot of people hear Walnut St. and automatically get off at Aiken, but the next stop is actually Bellefonte and I’m always on board for less walking.
The drinks: The most important features of The Yard’s brunch drink menu are the bottomless Mimosas and the build your own Bloody Mary bar. If you’re feeling something a bit stronger there are a variety of spiked coffee options.
We went for Mimosas. I, as the lightest lightweight on the planet, enjoyed them, but even I noticed they were heavy on the juice and light on the champagne. They’re overpriced, but they are bottomless so will probably get the job done if you don’t mind abusing your bladder.
The food is in a class of its own. Breakfast options include Snozzberry Pancakes, which are the sugariest thing I’ve ever eaten, Chicken ‘n’ Waffles Sliders, and Holla Holla French Toast, which is godly. What The Yard is really known for, though, is grilled cheese. I’m not talking about a little cheddar slapped between some bread. I’m talking about gloriously cheesy concoctions with at least five ingredients and some sort of delightful sauce. It’s as good as you think. Pro tip: the special is almost always a good idea.
The vibe: Okay, coming clean here: calling The Yard a bar is a bit of a stretch. It’s more of a restaurant that happens to feature affordable alcohol prominently. But for your boozy brunch needs close to campus, it can’t be beat.
The vibe is best described as comfy. The lighting is cheery, the music is usually good and when it isn’t it’s at least amusing. The service is great, particularly during brunch when the place is less packed, and the waitstaff are wonderful.
Lit or nah: Any place that serves french toast that is actually just a square donut with syrup is lit in my opinion. The Yard is a great brunch standby.

Congress has been in a rush to write out and pass a new tax reform bill in what would be the Republicans’ first major legislative accomplishment since they won control of both the legislative and executive branches of the government last year. One version of the bill has passed the House of Representatives, while the Senate recently passed its own version of the bill, mostly along partisan lines. They hope to reconcile the two versions of the bill and send it to President Trump’s desk for his signature before the Christmas holiday.
The tax reform bill has been widely criticized for the very rushed process involved in passing the bill that has happened mostly without Democrats’ input and which seems to be at least partly for the purpose of giving Republicans a legislative win before the end of the year. Republicans rejected a motion by Democrats to adjourn the vote to Monday to give senators time to read the several-hundred page bill. Essentially, the situation can be summed up in a CNN headline: “[t]he Senate voted on a tax bill pretty much nobody had read,” and was still being revised (even with handwriting in the margins) at the last few hours before the vote. 
Besides the rushed process, the tax bill would add, according to a nonpartisan analysis, about 1 trillion dollars to the deficit. The essence of the bill is a massive cut in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, while individual tax rates will be cut for a few years. According to Vox, besides corporations, the tax bill would favor older and wealthier Americans who get more income from investments rather than wages (as corporate tax cuts will primarily benefit shareholders).
Younger people, future generations, and the poor would stand to lose the most from this tax plan since the individual tax cuts would eventually expire (while the corporate tax cuts stay permanent) and the deficit will have to be shouldered eventually, whether through tax hikes, or chipping away at social services, or some combination of both.
What concerns Carnegie Mellon interim president Farnam Jahanian most are the provisions in the tax bill that would make higher education more expensive. Thus, he sent out a statement updating everyone on the provisions of the tax bills relevant to the campus community and higher educational institutions as a whole. In the statement, he blasted the parts of the legislation that would, as he termed it, “cause serious harm to higher education.”
Jahanian listed some key provisions of the House tax bill that he called the most “distressing”: “those that would tax graduate student tuition waivers, eliminate the exclusion of employer-assisted tuition benefits from taxable income and end the deduction of interest paid on student loans,” which he criticized as having the effect of “increas[ing] the cost of education and reduc[ing] student access.”
While he said that he was “pleased” to report that the Senate bill does not contain such provisions, “threats to higher education remain.” He cited as an example of a threat to higher educational institutions an excise tax levied on private university endowments of over $250,000 per student.
“While this level will not directly impact Carnegie Mellon,” Jahanian wrote in the statement, “our endowment is a crucial way we support scholarships, fellowships and the student experience, and this step would set a negative precedent for philanthropic support of higher education.” He also noted that because of the hurried legislative process, “the possibility [exists] that some of the worst provisions of the House bill could reappear as part of a legislative compromise.”
Jahanian praised the efforts of the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) to inform Congress and the public on the harm that the tax bill would cause to higher education and encouraged concerned students and faculty to make their voices heard.
“[W]e must keep up the intensity of our outreach,” he wrote near the conclusion of the statement. “I want to reaffirm our commitment to advocating for students and for higher education, and promise that we will continue to keep you informed.”

Hundreds gathered on Monday, Nov. 20, at the site of an abandoned steel factory. The event, however, was not meant to honor Pittsburgh’s past but instead to mark the beginning of a new development at the location. Carnegie Mellon University is set to lease two floors of the new building, which will be built in the Hazelwood neighborhood inside the frame of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company’s Mill 19.
The symbolic resonance of the location, recently renamed Hazelwood Green, was not lost on the attendees. Congressman Mike Doyle, Congressional Representative for Pittsburgh’s 14th district, was quoted in a Carnegie Mellon news release stating “in their heyday, Pittsburgh steel and Pittsburgh steelworkers were the envy of the world. Today’s groundbreaking is a sign that a new heyday is coming for Pittsburgh and for America — one that will transform and revive an entire sector of the American economy in every corner of our great nation.”
The site, formerly dubbed ALMONO after the first syllables of Pittsburgh’s rivers, has long been a focal point in the conversation of how Pittsburgh is changing, and what role institutions like Carnegie Mellon University should play in this change. A 2009 report released by Carnegie Mellon’s Remaking Cities Institute highlighted the neighborhood of Hazelwood, as possibly Pittsburgh’s “next big urban project” as the city emerges from “languishing in the wake of the restructuring of the steel industry.”
The site is also on the list of spaces being offered to Amazon for their much-contested HQ2 location, with Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald unsubtly joking at the renaming announcement “This is a wonderful, wonderful site that puts us in a competitive advantage with that company… it begins with an A ends with an N.”
Development by tech companies in Pittsburgh is sometimes highly controversial, with some residents pointing to revitalization following the decline brought by the loss of the steel industry, and others citing gentrification and inflated housing prices as real worries for the city.
The renaming of the ALMONO site as Hazelwood Green after the neighborhood adjacent to the undeveloped area, as well as the preservation of the structure of the steel factory signals an attempt to reconcile these tensions. At the renaming announcement, Mayor Bill Peduto stated, “Hazelwood has to be at the front. It has to be about the community. It has to be about the past as much as it will be about the future.”
The fact that both organizations that will be housed in the factory have manufacturing-based missions was also highlighted as significant, with Dennis Davin, Pennsylvania Secretary of Community and Economic Development, stating “the potential of this site, of the region, and of these partners to usher in this game-changing manufacturing renaissance,” as the reason that so many flocked to the preview in November.
The locale will host the Manufacturing Futures Initiative (MFI), a Carnegie Mellon initiative for manufacturing research, and the Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing Institute (ARM), a Pittsburgh-based independent organization started at Carnegie Mellon University.
Both groups are at the forefront of manufacturing research, with ARM receiving a 20 million dollar grant from the Department of Defense, a frequent funder of research at Carnegie Mellon University.
The usage of this space for these two initiatives led Interim President Farnam Jahanian to state at Monday’s event that “by bringing together large-scale academic research and industrial development under one roof, Mill 19 will become a true differentiator for Pittsburgh and for the region. When complete, it will be the first manufacturing hub of its kind in the nation — in the world, for that matter.”

Head of Carnegie Mellon’s Department of Psychology, Michael J. Tarr, has been selected as a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Tarr, also a member of the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), is being recognized for his research on the perception of faces, objects and scenes, computational and artificial vision systems, and perceptual expertise. His work has been centered on how the brain turns the 2D images that it sees into the perception of objects and scenes. Tarr’s other research includes visual categorization and semantics, and new imaging methods.
The AAAS is the publisher of Science and the world’s largest general scientific society that seeks to “advance science, engineering, and innovation throughout the world for the benefit of all people.” Of the AAAS fellows from Carnegie Mellon, Tarr is the 23rd and the seventh from the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. AAAS fellows are elected by peers to honor their scientific advancements.
Tarr first joined the Carnegie Mellon faculty in 2009 following previous careers at Brown and Yale. His efforts in the various mechanisms surrounding perception and cognition are a result of his interests in how humans perceive their surroundings as they learn faces, scenes, and objects and the interaction of how our visual senses interact with our other senses, thoughts, and emotions.
In addition to being named AAAS fellow, Tarr has also been named the Trustee Professor of Vision Science by Carnegie Mellon. Richard Scheines, dean of Dietrich College, has recognized Tarr as “a great scientist, propelling us toward a much deeper understanding of how the brain accomplishes the miracle of vision.” Scheines also commented on Tarr’s leadership qualities as the head of the Department of Psychology. Tarr’s research has been “absolutely critical in the rise of the college and the institution at large,” says Scheines in a university press release. “I am delighted that AAAS has elected him as a fellow and very pleased that we can honor him with the Trustee Professorship of Vision Science.”
Tarr previously served as the co-director of the CNBC, a joint program between Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh that supports cross-university neuroscience research. He has led the Department of Psychology since 2017 and was a founding member of BrainHub, Carnegie Mellon’s approach to answering brain science questions through the intersection of engineering, statistics, computer science, psychology, biology, and neuroscience departments.
“Carnegie Mellon and the entire Pittsburgh academic community is a special place for studying the nature of human intelligence, behavior and the brain.” Tarr said in a university press release. He credits the intersection between computer science, engineering, psychology, and neuroscience as unique and “the kind of interdisciplinary collaboration that will lead to a deeper understanding of the amazing complexity of the human brain.”
Looking ahead, Tarr is interested in connections between biology and artificial intelligence focusing on using computational vision systems to better understand the neural basis of human behavior. These biological vision models can also help to improve artificial vision systems.
“As a representative of this larger community, it is an honor to be recognized both by AAAS and CMU.”
Tarr will be inducted as AAAS fellow on Saturday, Feb. 17, 2018 during the AAAS annual meeting in Austin, TX. Carnegie Mellon will honor Tarr as the Trustee Professor of Vision Science in Fall 2018.

Situated inconspicuously between a laundromat and a glass and mirror store, Senyai Thai Kitchen seems like an unlikely place for a Carnegie Mellon project to take hold. Recent initiatives associated with Carnegie Mellon initially prompt big names: Uber, Google, and Duolingo. But when Tu Wade opened her humble restaurant in the Shadyside neighborhood, Carnegie Mellon faculty and students took advantage of the space and reaped well-deserved acclaims. 
When one enters the space, Senyai Thai Kitchen’s design ingenuity is easy to spot. The restaurant’s ceilings are visually layered with undulating lines and hanging light bulbs dot the ceiling. The lines form a continuous surface, which rises and falls like waves. The waves are sharp and cold, but calm and methodical. Its shapes are composed of metal slats parallel to each other. Standing anywhere in the restaurant provides an entirely different angle of the ceiling, a visual illusion of sorts. The space seems bigger as well, creating a “spatial weightlessness and visual expansion” with the continuous surface evoking a frozen movement of the ocean. Inspired by the vaulted geometry of ancient Thai architecture, the fin-like slats not only suggest movement but also reduce noise. Its acoustic setting allows reverberations to travel into the individual vault zones, reducing the sound level and creating “localized acoustic privacy” for guests. The overall dynamic visual experience may also play as a homage to the restaurant’s name (sen yai translates to “big noodles” in Thai), a bowl of hot noodles in broth.
The Senyai Thai Kitchen Project’s prominent ceiling was awarded the American Architecture Prize 2017 in Interior Design/Commercial Interior earlier last month. The American Architecture Prize, a highly respected award in the industry, is an international prize from over 1,000 entries worldwide. It celebrates work that pushes boundaries and sets new standards in architecture. CMU School of Architecture faculty members Dana Cupkova and Gretchen Craig established a complementary mission at the EPIPHYTE Lab, a multidisciplinary design and research practice in Ithaca, New York. The work the firm does “is more than the sum of [their] individual efforts… [they] look to create open systems that can exist, happily, beyond our ability to control.” The two executed the Senyai Thai Kitchen Project with help from a team of Carnegie Mellon fifth-year seniors: Trent Wimbiscus and Sinan Goral, and Thomas Sterling and Colleen Clifford, who both graduated Carnegie Mellon with bachelor's degrees in architecture in 2016.

Student Senate is currently making preparations to continue the First Lectures series in the upcoming semester. The First Lectures series seeks to encapsulate the spirit of Carnegie Mellon by giving the graduating class a platform to share their diverse experiences, stories, and wisdom with the rest of the university.
The First Lectures was started by Senate in the spring of 2014 to mirror the spirit of The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch, a book given to all incoming freshmen to discuss during Orientation, and for many, an integral part of the Carnegie Mellon University experience.
Rohini Sinha, a Senator planning the events, hopes that while listening to the speakers at this upcoming First Lectures series, the audience can be reminded of the lessons they have learned from reading the book and recapture the optimism and courage to pursue childhood dreams that it so strikingly captured. She hopes that the First Lectures series this year will similarly inspire and connect the Carnegie Mellon community.
“It’s exciting to me because it’s nice to have these graduating seniors talk about what they’ve learned at Carnegie Mellon and pass that knowledge onto the rest of the student body,” says Sinha.
The series consists of three hour-long events, with two graduating seniors telling their stories at each event. They are currently scheduled for three Thursdays in the spring semester, on Feb. 22, March 22, and April 26.
The Committee on Campus Life of Student Senate has already finished collecting nominations and is in the process of contacting those who were nominated to submit preliminary speech outlines. It will hold auditions next semester, with choices being based on how interesting, engaging, and unique each story is. This semester, there will be an emphasis on choosing a diverse set of stories to capture as much of what Carnegie Mellon University is and what it means to its community as possible.
This event has been massively successful in previous years, with roughly fifty people attending each of the three events. Student Senate will be once again using Facebook Live to allow people who cannot make it to the events to tune in and listen to the experiences of the speakers. To make sure you catch them, follow Carnegie Mellon Student Senate on Facebook. Also, keep an eye out on the page for announcements on which speakers were chosen and Facebook events!
Please direct any inquiries, comments, or concerns about this event to Rohini Sinha at rsinha1@andrew.cmu.edu.

“It’s not a movie that can really be put into a genre box,” said Jordan Peele about his debut feature film, Get Out, released earlier this year. Though it can be argued, as Peele mentions, that no clear genre perfectly encapsulates Get Out, it seemed clear to most people that a movie about a rich white community’s systematic acquisition of mind control and dominance over the black population was certainly nothing to be laughed at or joked about. The movie is all-together unsettling, and purposefully so.
But what about Get Out is so funny? It certainly isn’t the rich white family’s business in baiting and kidnapping black people to use as servants in their communities. It can’t possibly be the dark, paranoia-stricken, Twilight Zone-esque underworld that the hostages are sucked into. For many black people and others in minority communities — including Peele who describes the film as his truth — Get Out was a striking racial thriller that acted as a documentary of real-life experiences. However, to some, it still somehow lacked the seriousness necessary to be regarded as a real drama.
Consequently, Universal Studios submitted Get Out as a Comedy for the upcoming Golden Globes — a decision that unfortunately left out any input from Peele. The decision has prompted widespread visceral outrage — and rightfully so.
Defenders of the choice to push Get Out into the comedy category cite American Hustle’s same classification in 2015, suggesting that those mad at Get Out’s fate are merely overreacting and that this sort of thing happens all of the time. Though it is true that some directors and producers push their films away from the Drama category — where it is arguably easier to receive nominations and awards — this mistake seems much less trivial. The classification suggests that a story about the struggles of a young black man to free himself from the oppression of his white counterparts cannot possibly be anything but comical.
Some are crediting the narrowly established categories put forth by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for Get Out’s classification blunder, claiming that Drama is just too narrow of a category for the film to fit in. But the problem is much larger than that.
The problem instead lies with society’s view of what is compelling, thought-provoking, and empathy-worthy enough to be deemed a Drama. People view comedies and horror films in similar light. They’re entertaining, of course, but the contents and impact of the movies are largely confined to their hour and a half of screen time, serving purely as entertainment. They leaving much less impact than would a drama, whose themes and messages may stick with the audiences for a great length of time. The inability of Get Out to strike people as a drama points to the larger, more devastating issue that systematic oppression of people of color is not that important to those unoppressed.
Get Out came at a time when America was — and is — more divided than it has been in decades. People of color around the world are fighting for equality and justice, and their struggles are not being taken seriously. This film has received the same slight. Many of its themes are being brushed off as satirical and exaggerated because the general population doesn’t find this portrait of racism worthy of empathy. 
Classifying the film as a Drama would mean it would be held in a higher regard and discussed as such, meaning that real conversations about largely-subconscious systematic racism and oppression of people of color in America would be thrust into the spotlight in a whole new way. These are conversations that society desperately needs — yet refuses to have. Though Peele creatively weaves his humor into some scenes and characters from Get Out, the films importance and heavy subject matter remain far from a laughing matter.

In the wake of events like the “Unite the Right” Charlottesville, VA rally and last month’s “White Lives Matter” rally in Shelbyville, TN, many people are left wondering how we got to this point. How did the culture of hate in United States politics get so intense that Americans are waving Nazi flags despite the fact that their grandparents and great-grandparents actively fought to defeat Hitler’s Germany in World War II? How did we get to a point where the Klu Klux Klan (KKK), a group that our government should be in direct opposition with, felt like they could actively support our current president? 
Have we always been here, but only recently noticed as more and more white nationalist groups have come out of the woodwork? Or are these new converts to the white rights movement frustrated by their government and seeking any way to make their voices heard? These are important questions to ask as these voices get louder and louder. In order to expand and protect equality for all races, religions, genders, sexualities, ethnicities, and nationalities, we need to understand what is turning people away from that cause. 
This is what The New York Times reporter Richard Fausset attempted to do last week with his article “A Voice of Hate in America’s Heartland.” The article describes the daily life of white nationalist Tony Hovater, the “Nazi sympathizer next door” who enjoys watching Seinfeld and spending time with his wife and his four cats when he’s not working as a welder or advocating for the Traditional Worker Party, the extreme right-wing group that he co-founded. Fausset talks to Hovater about his frustrations with the government and references his gradual change in political stance, “from vaguely leftist rock musician to ardent libertarian to fascist activist.”
The article, however, drew significant criticism, with many people questioning why the story exists, since it doesn’t truly address the question of how Mr. Hovater made this transition in his political views. Fausset admitted to as much in his companion article to his story, “I Interviewed a White Nationalist and Facist. What Was I Left With?”  “What, of any of this, explained Mr. Hovater’s radical turn?” asks Fausset. “What prompted him to take his ideas beyond his living room… and on to Charlottesville?” This is the question that is left unanswered, and Fausset decided that “the unfilled hole would have to serve as both feature and defect.” 
This hole is the issue that many have struggled with in regards to the article, and The New York Times has since released a statement in apology. “We recognize that people can disagree on how to best tell a disagreeable story. What we think is indisputable, though, is the need to shed more light, not less, on the most extreme corners of American life and the people who inhabit them.” 
However, with a hole like that, the article is meaningless. We know that white nationalists and people that support their causes are also human. They probably also watch sitcoms like Seinfeld and enjoy spending time with their families and their pets. Maybe they are also musicians, like Hovater, or artists, like Hitler. To talk about these similar human aspects without talking about the differences as well, without talking about why Hovater is a white nationalist in comparison to others in his demographic who are not white nationalists is to normalize his behavior. In a country where it seems that these hateful views are becoming more and more normal both in society and in our government, the last thing that we need to do is to fuel that normalization.
The question is not “Who are these white nationalists?” but rather, “Why did these people choose to be white nationalists?” That is the information we need to know in order to push back against the tide of hateful speech and action. It’s what we need to know in order to prevent the alt-right from gaining more support in mainstream culture. Without that information, it is useless to profile a Nazi sympathizer, for that is just giving more visibility to groups that should remain on the fringes of our political system. 
Have we always had this white nationalist support, or is this a new uprising? How did we get to this point in our society? These are the questions we need to answer, and these are the stories we need to be telling.

Editor’s note:  Transatlantic Thoughts is a weekly column that examines Carnegie Mellon’s student life from a foreigner’s perspective. Find previous installments @thetartan.org.
For my last article in this newspaper, I want to share my impressions about a significant shift that has unrolled for the last year and a half in how we perceive the world. Indeed, Brexit and Trump’s election have confirmed the end of an Anglo-Saxon supremacy over international relations. However, the rise of movements in Western Europe which was predicted to swallow the Netherlands, France, and Germany during 2017 has ultimately failed to bring to power Trump-style nationalist leaders in those countries. As a little break from the U.S. news frenzy, I propose this week a little recap on what has been going on in Europe for the past year.
One thing to always keep in mind about Europe is that nothing is simple, and the European Union (EU) raises complexity to an art. Nevertheless, it is important to know what the EU really is. The EU is an alliance of 28 member states that started out as a free trade and single market zone, but has gradually become some kind of supra-national entity with a Parliament, an executive body (the European Commission) and a court system. The main accomplishments of the EU are the common currency (the euro), the possibility for individuals to move and work freely anywhere (the Schengen area), and a comprehensive set of common regulations that transformed the 28 little states into a unified commercial power. But the most important accomplishment of the EU has been to eradicate war from Western Europe: the “balance of powers” geopolitical equilibrium that dominated in Europe until WWII has been replaced by a peaceful collaboration, necessary for Europe to continue to stand out in the international scene.
Because nothing is simple in Europe, the EU has suffered a long sequence of setbacks. In the ‘90s, it failed to stop the conflict in the Balkans (one of whose military leaders has just committed suicide in an international court). It has also failed to build a clear and common international policy, as was shown during the Iraq War when Germany and the U.K. participated but not France. The EU has enhanced social dumping inside the EU with its Posted Workers directive of 1996 (which has just been revised), and has failed to appease increasing social discontentment from those who suffered from globalization.
But the biggest failure of the EU recently has been the handling of the migrant crisis triggered by the Libyan and Syrian conflicts since the mid 2010s. While Italy and Greece had to rescue most of the migrants that ran aground their shores, only Germany took a clear pro-welcome stance that led to the asylum of 1.7 million people seeking applications for this country alone. The free circulation of individuals inside the Schengen area made it impossible for the member states to consider the problem individually.
It is necessary to distinguish the illegal migrants from the refugees that flee their home country because of war or prosecutions, and which represented the majority of the migrants arriving in Europe. However a lot of nationalist parties in Europe used the confusion between them to raise fear among local populations, prophesying a “great replacement” of their people by some supposedly blood-thirsty Islamists wanting to impose Sharia law.
That is why Poland and Hungary (both members of the EU) have elected as leaders right-wing nationalistic personalities that have promised to specifically save their country from this imminent peril. However, these leaders have been mostly busy undermining democratic institutions in their countries since their election, which poses a problem to the EU — one condition to be a member state is to be a functioning democracy.
This bleak perspective and apocalyptic ideology suggest in some aspects the state of mind in Western European countries in the 1930s, where part of French and British elites were sympathetic to the new German regime. According to a prominent historian Marc Bloch, in his book The Strange Defeat, one of the causes of the quick defeat of the French army in 1940 is that many of its generals believed that the country should be punished for having elected in 1936 a socialist leadership that granted the people two weeks of paid holidays (by the way, paid holidays now equal five weeks in France).
In this context, Brexit and the Trump election sent shockwaves throughout Europe. At that point, it appeared that one could not count on the unwavering support of the U.S. as leader of the free world. But as the 2017 elections were approaching in France, Germany, and the Netherlands, the real-world consequences of the choice of the U.K. and the U.S. was becoming clear. Particularly, the total collapse of the UKIP leadership after its historic victory showed that these politicians did not want to serve their country but rather were seeking to transpose trolling into real life.
And so people denied Trump wannabes Marine Le Pen (FN), Geert Wilders (PVV), and Alice Weidel (AfD) leadership, despite giving their parties their largest shares of vote ever. But these elections brought real changes in their countries. In France, the 30-year-old two-party system has been single-handedly shattered by Emannuel Macron and his movement “En marche.” Meanwhile, Germany is facing its most important parliamentary crisis since WWII as Angela Merkel’s future as chancellor is undermined by her inability to form a coalition.
In this new Europe, the left-right divide is less relevant than before, and a new force seems to emerge for protecting the people from the excesses of capitalism and neo-liberalism. Member-states of the EU understood that the only way to move forward in this direction was to unify their social policies, and thus the first European Social Summit was held three weeks ago.
We have been used to imagining the future as apocalyptic for a certain number of years, and it is true that climate change is a sword of Damocles that is already halfway into its fall on our heads. However, my opinion is that there is still hope for the EU to become a major power in the world that upholds a balanced mix of social policies, democratic values and individual freedoms, in contrast to the forced stability of the Chinese, maintained by limiting freedom of speech and political opposition.
The road to this scenario is paved with European leadership and consensus issues, and it would be presumptuous to predict anything at this point given the world’s instability. Nevertheless, what is sure is that the U.S. will be the missing player in the European equation. This month, 20 EU member states signed a deal to integrate military planning, weapons development and operations, furthering the effort for a European common defense to weigh in. As 1989 was the fall of the Eastern block, 2017 may well be recorded as the end of the Cold War-era Western block and its American leader.
Given this perspective, one could understand the alleged Russia’s efforts and meddling in the Western countries electoral life. From the Russian perspective (and especially Putin’s perspective), 2017 may well have been the final act of the Cold War, that evened the scales and questioned Western supremacy.
As a conclusion and after this broad and incomplete summary of what one could arrogantly call “the state of the European Union,” let us come back to the U.S. Like many American citizens, I am appalled by the current level of American politics. However, I want to believe that this is just a temporary affliction and that the outcome of the special counsel investigation will put an end to this masquerade.
Given this, it is important for Americans to think about what will come next, and for that the country will need informed opinions. That is why I urge people to get interested and involved in politics, to read good news sources both domestic and international in order to forge an opinion on complex matters that should be based on confronting your values to the reality. As engineers, it is easy to get obsessed by technology and to think it is the answer to all problems. But technology is neither good nor bad — all that matters is the manner in which you use it. In conclusion, never forget to apply your knowledge to the cause you believe is good for the world!

On Nov. 19, former lawyer for Verizon and the Trump-appointed Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Ajit Pai released a proposal to rollback regulations that protected equal access to the internet, a principle known as “net neutrality.” These regulations prevented Internet Service Providers (ISPs), such as Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T, from altering the speed of the delivery of websites, while also preventing them from charging consumers higher fees for services relating to faster speeds. 
“Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet,” stated Pai in an emailed statement to reporters. “Instead the FCC would simply require internet providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that’s best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate.” 
Pai’s announcement shocked proponents of net neutrality and even industry analysts who had already expected the FCC to reorganize certain provisions relating to common carriers, known as Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.
In an email titled “Shock and Awe and Net Neutrality,” Craig Moffet, an independent cable analyst, reflected that the “FCC Draft Order on Net Neutrality went much further than we ever could’ve imagined in not only reversing Title II, but in dismantling virtually all of the important tenets of net neutrality itself.” 
In the age of the internet, net neutrality is a principle that is more important than ever. As the internet has become one of the most popular mediums of communication, a virtual place in which individuals come to engage in conversation, post opinions, and consume content, net neutrality ensures that every individual within the virtual community is treated equally. Without the adherence to such a principle, slippery slopes may arise in which a certain group of individuals — ISPs in this case — have the authority to control the access to or relative speeds of the internet, yielding these individuals the power to discriminate users based on any factor.
Posted by The London School of Economics’ Media Policy Project, a blog argued that “in many ways, net neutrality could be considered the first amendment to the internet… compromising the principle of net neutrality should be for very specific and clearly defined reasons that are transparent and do not serve commercial private interests, but rather public interests or are implemented in a view of guaranteeing an excellent quality of service for all.” 
Indeed, net neutrality should not be compromised in a way in which private interests trump public ones. By doing so, we are leaving ourselves vulnerable to the hands of the few, who have the opportunity to capitalize on their newfound authority. With the repeal of the aforementioned provisions, ISPs could begin to discriminate consumers based on types of content consumed, essentially allowing ISPs to slow down speeds for content that the ISP deems unfavorable to their business while maintaining high speeds for "favorable" content. 
However, multimedia content aside, a far more important implication of the infringement on net neutrality is the effects it may bring upon American democracy. Many consider the internet to be the "great equalizer" in which everyone is on an equal playing field; for instance, the internet treats the tweets of the President of the United States equally as a meme posted on Facebook. This equality has done much for the American democracy in terms of creating a platform for expanded discourse and greater access to information, allowing citizens to make more informed political decisions by being more involved in political conversations. Infringing upon net neutrality would be counteractive to the democratic nature of the internet itself, giving ISPs control over these mediums of communication that so many people rely on today. 
I believe one of the core and fundamental responsibilities of government is to ensure and protect the proper functioning of its democracy. In the digital era, I argue that the internet is a critical medium in which American democracy functions and thrives. Handing off the power to ISPs to control and discriminate users — to a certain extent, of course — through levels of access or speeds  on the internet is irresponsible and destructive to American democracy itself; no private entity should wield such powers, not because they are untrusted per se but due to the mismatch between private and public interests. As Pai's proposal becomes implemented in the upcoming months, and with no expected action from a Republican-majority Congress, we should deeply consider and reflect upon the value of net neutrality to American society.
"There can be no truly open internet without net neutrality," stated former FCC Commissioner Michael Copps in an interview with The Nation. "To believe otherwise is to be captive to special interest power brokers or to an old and discredited ideology that thinks monopoly and not government oversight best serves the nation."

Beijing police have taken a 22-year-old female teacher into custody for allegedly drugging and molesting her kindergarten students. RYB Education, the Beijing-based and New York-listed company that runs the kindergarten, apologized to the children, parents, and public in a press release issued Nov. 25 of this year. The company operates in approximately 300 Chinese cities and runs about 1,300 daycare centers and 500 kindergartens. The company said they fired the teacher and the head of the kindergarten and suspended other teachers involved. The company also promised to provide psychological counseling to the victims, upgrade safety measures, and set up an independent supervision system. However, like many people have expressed on social media, I agree that the company’s response to the incident has been less than adequate.
Parents of the children at the school are horrified that such an incident could happen at a prestigious school (one that costs as much as 5,000 yuan, equivalent to $750, a month). In fear, many parents have pulled their children out of the school. As a result of the incident, RYB’s stock plummeted about 40 percent, and the company announced a plan to buy back shares worth $50 million. This shows how the company puts profit before public interest, as they made their announcement before even holding a press conference about the incident.
This isn’t the first time teachers at an RYB-run school have faced sexual abuse charges. In two cases in northeastern China, four RYB teachers were each sentenced to more than two years in prison for abusing 17 children. This begs the question: How can this current incident be unrelated? The answer: it’s not. There are undoubtedly corrupt practices occurring behind the scenes regarding the way that teachers are hired. The number of teachers accused is too high for anyone to think otherwise.
The incident has brought in much attention to child abuse and sexual molestation laws in China. The laws in place now are extremely vague and lax, leading many cases to go unreported, especially in rural areas. The media in China has documented many cases of sexual abuse in childcare facilities. In an investigative piece published last year, only 968 cases of sexual abuse against children were recorded nationwide between 2013 and 2015, involving at least 1,790 children, with many remaining unreported. With such flimsy laws, how can anyone be confident enough to report abuse to the police?
RYB’s insufficient response and action towards the incident has led many parents to take responsibility upon themselves to educate other caregivers on how to look for signs of abuse on their children. I believe it is disheartening that parents have to resort to helping each other protect their children through these means when laws should be changed to give stricter punishments to molesters. This would, in turn, give parents the confidence to report more of these incidents to the police.
The most heartbreaking stories to read were of parents' responses to how they found out their child was abused, and the effects it had on their child. One mother told reporters her three-year-old daughter was asked to strip after being injected with a brown liquid, along with other children, before being "examined" by a naked adult male stranger. The mother, as well as other parents of the victims, told reporters they found multiple needle marks on their children's bodies. A grandfather picking up his four-year-old granddaughter said the four-year old mentioned her classmates were being forced to take white pills for disobedience and everyone was told to keep it a secret. Yet another mother reported that her child told her that the teacher said it was a secret and they cannot tell anyone, not even their parents. The mother said, "She now bursts into screaming at night, saying, 'I'm not sick, why do I have to get a shot?'"
It is painful to even imagine what these children and their parents have been through, and simply suspending or firing the teachers responsible is not enough. More severe punishment must be doled out to the perpetrators to ensure that people get the message that such disgusting, immoral acts will not be tolerated or dealt with lightly. However, since this incident received so much attention, other parents with small children were prompted to check on their children. This led to the uncovering of dozens of instances of abuse at a Shanghai kindergarten run by a leading Chinese travel agency. In response, the Chinese government has ordered a nationwide investigation into all kindergartens, and has promised stricter punishment for perpetrators of child abuse. However, posts and comments on social media, and public fury at this scandal may reflect a deeper anxiety and uncertainty among ordinary Chinese citizens.
This incident is eerily familiar to the abominable incident in 2002 in Boston, MA, where former priest John J. Geoghan was charged for molesting children. Since the mid-1990s, more than 130 people have come forward with horrific recollections of how former priest John J. Geoghan fondled or raped them during a three-decade spree. These children were afraid to speak up because they were afraid of the consequences, and they were unsure of how to handle the situation, because it was their priest, a friend of their family, who had done this to them.
This shows how it’s not just in China where incidents of molestation go unreported. There are numerous cases, not only in the U.S., but also in other countries, that are not brought to light because people are afraid of the repercussions, and in most cases, the law is not strong enough on child abuse to give victims confidence that they will be supported. There aren’t enough words to express my disgust towards the perpetrators for harming these children. It angers me further how the teachers were simply suspended or fired, and harsher punishment is not being dealt to them. I believe, however, it is the media’s role to seek out these stories and report the truth to spread awareness of such situations, because, sadly, they happen around the globe and more often than we suspect.

'Tis the season for holiday lights, gingerbread cookies, gift-giving... and controversies surrounding disposable cups at Starbucks. As it has since 2015, Starbucks finds itself caught in another cup controversy.
This year, Starbucks' campaign video features two girls. Many have interpreted the two girls as a lesbian couple, and many have noticed that the couple's hands are featured on this year's cup. Although when asked by Buzzfeed if the hands belonged to a lesbian couple, Starbucks did not give a straight answer and instead told consumers to interpret the cup — especially the hands — however they wish.
Prominent conservative commentator Ben Shapiro tweeted, "why can't [Starbucks] just make an apolitical cup," confirming that he believes sexuality is inherently political. He is in great company, considering the thousands of likes and supportive retweets.
War on Christmas aside, the fact that the association with the LGBTQ community has met such a response is disheartening. Had it been a man and a woman in the video and on the cup, people would assume the pair was a couple simply enjoying a hot beverage. However, because the pair has been interpreted as a lesbian couple, it has opened up a whole Pandora's box of criticism. Regardless, even if it were intended for the pair to be a romantic couple, the love that comes with the holidays, not the gender of those in love, should be the focal point.
Looking back at Starbucks' Christmas cups in years past, one can easily see that there is nothing inherently related to Christmas. Even before the controversial plain red cup that had everybody talking in 2015, holiday lights, ornaments, and snowflakes adorned the festive red cups. There were no Wise Men on their camels or Stars of Bethlehems printed on the cups, yet nobody announced Starbucks as a contender in the War on Christmas. However, the minimalistic design of the plain red cup seemed to spark the beginning of a now annual trend. In 2016, the green cup, which was faced with more controversy yet again for not directly displaying Christmasy illustrations.
Now, Starbucks has released a new cup that features a white heart framed by two hands. The white heart allows space for customers to place someone who is important in their lives. Starbucks claims that they intended to release two cups, but the second cup was not released until Nov. 26. Thus far, Starbucks has successfully avoided criticism for their new cup design.
Even after finding itself in the center of controversy, Starbucks is still dominating the coffee industry and enjoying growth over the years. Sure, Starbucks may lose a handful of consumers, but it has enough customers who will happily stand in line to get their festive beverages and be glad that the lines have gotten shorter for the holidays.

As the first semester of my time at Carnegie Mellon draws to a close, I can’t help but think of all the ways that this school, as well as the general college experience itself, has defied my expectations. Despite there still being many semesters to go, which no doubt will include some of the busiest periods that I will experience, I think this is as good a time as any to do some reflection.
Despite how fast the days went by, I cannot claim to be surprised, especially since I had the same experience during my senior year of high school. While I thought everything to be long and tedious during the actual day-by-day operations of college, thinking back on what has happened made it seem shockingly brief. I can still feel move-in day and orientation week jitters, but all of that was months ago! Still, already having one-eighth of my college education almost finished does not sound like a minor feat.  
What shocked me the most about my experience here, however, was the inexplicable disappearance of senioritis, which I had been inflicted with mere months before entering this school. I feel that nothing substantial within myself has changed, yet I seem to be procrastinating less and less, taking on tasks in a timely manner more and more. 
Having so much freedom and need for self sufficiency appears to have made me willing, even excited to handle responsibilities, as menial as they may be, which can include anything from doing my laundry in regular intervals to ensuring that I don’t stuff myself with too many ultimate brownies (which some may know as taking care of one’s health).
Perhaps I am the type who works better under minimal supervision, but the routines of high school seem positively stifling to me now. The watchful eyes of both high school teachers and parents somehow made me more prone to put off homework or avoid my obligations, which was a surprising thing to realize. Here, I am the captain of my own ship, and I am perfectly willing to sink or swim with my boat, because the outcomes are entirely dependent on myself and myself only. 
Now, I can admit to finally beginning to understand why some people say that college is some of the best years of their lives. As for me, while I cannot say that conclusively yet, I am extremely excited for what the next three and a half years have in store for me at Carnegie Mellon.

Alton Lu is pursuing a Master of Public Policy and Management – Data Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University. He is interested in using data science to solve human-made challenges. Lu is currently a research analyst at the University of Washington.
Ensuring security, promoting peace, and spreading influence across the world have been cornerstones of every American president’s foreign policy initiatives. However, North Korea has challenged these goals since the 1950s, and it has become difficult to deal with the competing objectives of China, South Korea, and Japan. Multiple rounds of U.N. sanctions have done little to curb the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)’s nuclear ambitions, and no international appeal has prompted China to apply stricter sanctions. Japan and South Korea — two American allies — face continual threats from North Korea militancy, which forces the United States to engage in the region. The result has been the continual advancement of the North Korean nuclear program despite denouncements from the rest of the world. Understanding the competing objectives of major nations in the North Korean issue is essential to resolving the issue peacefully.
Since the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)entered into force in 1970, the five official nuclear-armed states have had an interest in limiting proliferation to maintain nuclear exclusivity, while smaller states have had an interest in preventing proliferation for their own security purposes. Since nuclear programs are expensive, many small states would prefer the continued equilibrium and safety that exists with the official nuclear club.
But that small-state interest doesn’t apply to North Korea. Facing threats from the United States and South Korea, the DPRK has continued their nuclear weapons programs for self-defense. The state’s paranoia is not unfounded. Back in 1953, Secretary of State John Dulles told the U.N. Security Council that use of nuclear weapons may be required to end the conflict in Korea. Forty years later, the DPRK pulled out of the NPT, stating that “we [have taken] the resolute action of pulling out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and have manufactured nuclear arms for self-defense to cope with the Bush administration’s evermore undisguised policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK.” After a recent test in 2016, North Korea released another official statement: “The DPRK will take further measures to bolster the state nuclear force in quality and quantity for safeguarding its dignity and right to existence and genuine peace from the U.S. increasing threat of a nuclear war [sic].” These perceived threats from the United States have been the reasoning for continued nuclear weapons development.
But even if North Korea had convincing evidence that the United States posed no threat, North Korea still wouldn’t disarm. Kim Jong Un, like most dictators, is concerned with maintaining and holding power. Robert Manning, of the Brent Scowcroft Center stated, “the Kim Jong Un regime’s very identity is so bound up with nuclear weapons that he changed the country’s constitution to declare North Korea a nuclear state. The bureaucratic inertia of four decades in the development of nuclear weapons and deep mutual distrust between the United States and North Korea are a powerful combination precluding denuclearization.”
One of his key objectives is to ensure the Kim family rule in perpetuity, which is only possible with the continued development of the nuclear program. For the last three generations of the Kim family, nuclear weapons have provided a symbol of independence, security, and self-sufficiency. It represents the power, not just of Kim, but of the entire DPRK. Any sort of discussion that even considers a disarmed North Korea is doomed to failure. A reversal in the nuclear program for North Korea would be akin to a denouncement of democracy in the United States.
The United States is now struggling to determine a policy in Asia that reinforces the nuclear umbrella while minimizing the possibility of a North Korean attack on American soil. Balancing the protection of Japan and South Korea is difficult when the North views these moves as a threat to their sovereignty. While the United States struggles to fully commit to either umbrella reinforcement or threat minimization, support for nuclear weapons development in South Korea and Japan grows. Yet, this is also at odds with another United States goal — to limit the proliferation of nuclear weapons. There are no good options for the United States. On one end, the U.S. can recommit to the nuclear umbrella and face the threat of losing Seattle to save Seoul. However, to minimize the possibility of attack on the mainland, the United States may have to accept further nuclear proliferation in East Asia.
However, further proliferation in East Asia is also at odds with China’s objectives in Asia China’s primary goals are to restrict nuclear weapons proliferation in Asia while maintaining a stable North Korea. China has no desire to be surrounded by nuclear weapons. Russia, India and Pakistan already possess nuclear weapons and surround China from the north to the west; a nuclear Japan and South Korea would bring weapons to the east and south. However, China also wants to avoid a humanitarian crisis and American soldiers on its border. China doesn’t see itself as a charity and sees North Korea as a useful buffer towards U.S. soldiers in South Korea. Like the U.S., China seeks two-mutually exclusive visions — the stability of North Korea and denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula. To this date, China has chosen stability.
Creating a coherent strategy for North Korea is essential to securing American interests in Asia. Ensuring that American influence continues in Asia is increasingly important as China seeks to solidify their power in Asia. American resolve for nuclear deterrence is already being questioned in Japan and South Korea. Pulling back and allowing this crisis to continue will only weaken American influence at a time when China has begun to flex its global power. To solve this crisis and return to a long-term focus on America’s role in Asia, the United States needs to fully consider options that align with the objectives of every other nation in the game — namely China and North Korea.
