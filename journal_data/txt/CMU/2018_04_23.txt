Every year, Carnegie Mellon University’s Spring Carnival features many exciting events, from the creativity of Booth at Midway to the bright colors of Holi on the Mall. One event that stands above the rest as a true year-round event is Sweepstakes, better known as Buggy.
The talented and experienced women’s and men’s teams from the Student Dormitory Council (SDC) dominated the field, as they have for the past several years. While neither the men’s or women’s teams broke any records that were set in last year’s races, the day was still filled with fun and drama.
The 99th annual Buggy races were held on Friday and Saturday on the campus’s 0.84-mile race course starting at Tech and Frew Streets. Buggy refers to the compact unmotorized vehicle that holds a driver, and is pushed across the mainly uphill track by five different pushers, a relay race of sorts where the buggy is the baton.
After months of engineering a sleek, fast buggy and training early in the morning, the teams raced in the preliminary heats on Friday. On the women’s side, three teams from SDC, three from Fringe, two from Carnegie Involvement Association (CIA), one from Pi Kappa Alpha (PiKA), and one from SPIRIT qualified for the 10-team final.
Teams SDC B and Fringe C kicked off the women’s finals in the first heat. SDC B quickly moved ahead on Hill 1, and built on the lead throughout the race. They finished with a time of 2:37.49, nearly 15 seconds ahead of Fringe C’s 2:52.16 time, and good enough for fourth place.
Another team from SDC, SDC C, faced off against Fringe A in the next race. Fringe A established a quick lead moving in to the free roll, the downhill section in the middle of the race when the driver in the buggy steers without help from pushers. Fringe A’s final time of 2:38.87 was slower than their preliminary time on Day 1, but was still enough to beat SDC C’s time of 2:56.95.
The third race of the day featured two teams from the same organization, CIA A and CIA B. The race began close on Hills 1 and 2, but CIA A pulled away in later sections. While CIA A’s 2:36.36 time was half a second slower than their preliminary time, CIA B’s 2:44.84 finals time shaved off nearly four seconds from their preliminary time.
Racing against Fringe B, PiKA A got off to a hot start with a big push on Hill 1. Some shaky transitions slowed them down, allowing Fringe B to make up some ground in one of the closer races of the day. PiKA A finished in 2:35.01, slower than in the preliminary races, and Fringe B crossed the line in 2:39.77, over three seconds faster than their previous time.
In the final race of the women’s competition, SDC A looked to defend their win from 2017’s Sweepstakes. While the race was more SDC A against its own record, SPIRIT A challenged them, staying with SDC A in Hill 1, before falling behind in the transition into Hill 2. SDC A won the competition with a time of 2:23.60, over 11 seconds faster than second-place finisher PiKA A. SPIRIT A finished in 2:39.06, fast enough to make the six-team podium.
In the men’s competition, two teams from SDC, two teams from CIA, two teams from Sigma Phi Epsilon (SigEp), two teams from PiKA, one team from Fringe, and one team from Apex qualified for the 10-team final, while four teams, one from Apex, SPIRIT, SDC, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) each, competed in solo re-rolls down the track.
Fringe B and SigEp C participated in the first race of Saturday’s men’s finals. Fringe B quickly made separation from SigEp C, and finished in 2:15.53, a second faster than their preliminary time. Unfortunately, SigEp C’s fifth and final pusher suffered a leg injury on Hill 5, struggling but managing to finish the race in 2:39.51.
In their race, both CIA A and PiKA B were very strong on the first two hills, and stayed very close in their pushes into the free roll. CIA A took the inside line of the roll, forcing PiKA B to let off speed to prevent contact. Though PiKA B made up some ground at Hill 4, CIA A finished the race first in 2:12.96, with PiKA B following with a great time of 2:17.30, over four seconds faster than their preliminary time.
SDC B and CIA B competed in the next race. CIA B won Hill 1, but a small stumble in the transition to Hill 2 cost them the lead. The SDC B pushers gained a large lead in the final three hills to finish in 2:12.77. CIA B finished in 2:16.45.
The penultimate race of the event had the most dramatic moment of the races. Racing against Apex A, PiKA A pulled ahead on Hill 1, but spun out and hit the hay in the free roll. While they did not finish, Apex A crossed the line in 2:20.61.
Like in the women’s competition, the final race was less about the two teams racing at the same time and more about SDC A racing against its own records. SigEp A finished in 2:14.69, over three seconds faster than their preliminary time and good for fourth place, but the real show was SDC A.
At every section, SDC A gained speed and eventually finished in 2:03.17, short of the record time 2:02.16 set last year, but more than enough to win the team’s seventh consecutive Sweepstakes championship.
The final results of the competition were not surprising, but the fun and excitement of Buggy remains each year, as members of the Carnegie Mellon community, both current and from the past, come to watch a staple in the university’s history and an integral part of its community.

With both the 2018 Formula 1 (F1) and IndyCar championships three races in, it is shaping up to be an enticing, drama filled year for the two motorsports series. In F1, the highest level of world-wide open-wheel racing, Mercedes’ long-held dominance appears to finally be over, with Mercedes languishing behind the quick race pace of the Ferraris. In IndyCar, an America-only open wheel series, 2016 Indy 500 winner Alexander Rossi has extended his strong second half of 2017 into the new year with two podiums and a race win so far, while reigning champion Josef Newgarden, with one 2018 win to his name, is not far behind.
In 2014, F1 cars switched from screaming V8 engines to turbocharged V6 hybrid units, and the “hybrid era” has since been controlled by Mercedes. The team handily won in 2014, with their driver Lewis Hamilton beating his teammate Nico Rosberg to the Drivers’ title. 2015 was much of the same, although Rosberg put up a stronger fight. In 2016, the teammates clashed both on and off the track, with several collisions causing their relationship to deteriorate as they fiercely battled for the championship; Rosberg won and subsequently retired, with Mercedes yet again easily taking the Constructors’ trophy. 2017 saw Ferrari begin to catch up: while Hamilton and Mercedes still triumphed, Ferrari driver and four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel won five races and even led during the first half of the season.
With the dust settled from the first three races of 2018, it is evident that Mercedes no longer has the clear upper hand. The season’s first grand prix in Australia saw Vettel win due to excellent strategy from Ferrari, pitting with the lead when a stopped car brought a Virtual Safety Car (VSC) period, allowing him to retain the lead since Hamilton had to slow down to obey the VSC speed limit. The other Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen was also fast, placing third, while the other Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas finished a distant eighth due to a crash in qualifying dropping his starting position to 15th.
In an action-packed Bahrain Grand Prix, Vettel barely coaxed his worn tires to a second victory, ahead of the chasing Bottas, who finished a mere 0.699 seconds behind. Hamilton desperately searched for pace, finishing six seconds down in third, while a mistimed pit stop sent a Ferrari mechanic to the hospital with a fractured leg and a disgruntled Raikkonen back to the garage with no points.
In China, Ferrari seemed to retain their advantage over Mercedes, with Vettel quickly crafting a sizable lead over Bottas while Hamilton struggled to keep up. However, the safety car appeared when the two Toro Rosso cars collided on lap 31, letting Red Bull drivers Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo pit for new tires, giving them more pace when the race restarted. The two Red Bulls blew past Raikkonen and Hamilton, but Verstappen tried an ambitious late-braking move against Vettel on the 43rd lap, causing both drivers to spin out. Verstappen was promptly handed a ten second time penalty, putting him down in fifth behind Hamilton, while Vettel slid down the field, coming home a measly eighth. Meanwhile, Ricciardo set after Bottas, eventually grabbing the lead on lap 45 with a ballsy move down the inside of the Mercedes into the tight right-hander of turn four. While Hamilton finished ahead of Vettel and inched closer in the standings, the Mercedes duo had trouble matching the speed of the Ferraris all weekend, and the quick Vettel was an unfortunate victim of Verstappen’s overzealous passing attempt.
Vettel currently leads the championship with 54 points. Hamilton is nine points back, with Bottas a further five behind that. Ricciardo is nipping at the Mercedes’ heels after his race win with 37 points, while Raikkonen sits fifth with 30. Verstappen’s difficult start leaves him in eighth, getting him tangled up in the intense mid-field battle between the McLaren’s Fernando Alonso, Renault’s Nico Hulkenberg, and Haas’s Kevin Magnussen. In the Constructors’ Championship, Mercedes leads Ferrari by a single point, while Red Bull lurks 29 points behind.
Over in the United States, the IndyCar season is providing lots of exciting racing as Rossi looks to build an early championship lead. The opening street race in St. Petersburg, FL saw four-time champion Sebastian Bourdais snatch his 74th win, after Rossi made contact with rookie Robert Wickens on lap 108 of 110 while battling for the lead. Rossi fought back to finish third. The reigning champion Newgarden had a tricky race down in seventh, while Graham Rahal finished second.
Newgarden had better luck at the oval circuit of Phoenix, where he used a late pit stop to don fresh tires and make up four places in seven laps to win ahead of Wickens and Rossi.
Rossi stormed to an assertive win at the Long Beach street circuit, where he led all but 14 of 85 laps. Former champion Will Power finished second, while Ed Jones rounded out the podium. Newgarden yet again finished seventh, while Bourdais finished down in 13th despite some masterful passing moves. The win elevated Rossi to first in the championship with 126 points, while Newgarden sits second with 104. Rahal and Bourdais are third and fourth with 93 and 88 points, respectively.
IndyCar moves to the race circuit of Barber Motorsports Park for the Grand Prix of Alabama on April 22, while F1 travels to the capital of Baku for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix on April 29.

Carnegie Mellon University and the World Economic Forum (WEF) jointly launched a new website to the public, EarthTime.org, on Earth Day, April 22, 2018.
The interactive website allows people to view images of the entire world and the visual impact that humans have made (and continue to make) on the planet. Images captured by NASA satellites cover a period from 1986 to 2016.
EarthTime was created in a partnership between Carnegie Mellon’s Community Robotics, Education and Technology Empowerment Lab (CREATE Lab), and the WEF to provide visual evidence of how humans’ decisions have changed the planet. The initiative hopes to help global leaders make well-informed and accurate decisions that impact the Earth.
“EarthTime is a means to tell stories,” said Illah Nourbakhsh in a university press release. Nourbakhsh is a Carnegie Mellon professor of robotics and director of the CREATE Lab as part of the university’s Robotics Institute and has spearheaded EarthTime’s development over the last decade. He also serves as a WEF Global Steward. “The impact of humanity can be seen globally and in individual communities — and at every scale in between.”
The website features interactive, educational animations called "Stories" that cover different topics about human-environment interaction, including deforestation, urbanization, and glacier retreat.
“You really can’t understand climate change, migration or major social and political trends without examining their connections across time, across space and between each other,” added Nourbakhsh. “EarthTime enables you to do that.”
EarthTime continues to grow and incorporate numerous data sets from different institutional sources across the world. It uses data from government agencies such as NASA and the U.S. Census, non-government agencies like the United Nations, and private institutions, including Oxford University, Harvard University, and the University of Maryland.
Before this public launch, EarthTime had been used within institutions since 2015 at annual WEF events around the world to visualize, analyze, and understand the most important global issues today. But, by going public, the platform can now be used by anyone who wants to know more about how the world has changed, and what they should do about it.

Voice-activated technology may be the next big hit in the tech world. With 41.4 million users for Siri and 0.2 million monthly users for Cortana, Siri and Cortana are the primary competitors of Amazon Alexa, which has 2.6 million users. As these companies compete to provide the best features in their voice technologies, users benefit from consistent improvements. 
So, what is Alexa exactly and how does it work? Alexa is a voice service from Amazon that powers "smart speaker" devices like the Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, and Amazon Tap. It can be found on any Alexa enabled device that is configured with Alexa voice service, such as Amazon’s Fire TV and tablets. Alexa waits for a wake word (“Alexa” by default) to start a conversation. Once that word is spoken, Alexa begins listening to you, and then you can ask Alexa to do things for you (such as playing music) or use a skill you downloaded.
Although Siri and Cortana’s user base is declining, Alexa’s is consistently growing. Amazon continues to attract developers with high-stakes hackathons in order to add to Alexa's 15,000+ skills. Alexa's skills page is becoming as populated as the App Store, which makes it hard for developers to come up with new, unique skills. On the other hand, it is also leading to increasingly unique and helpful skills for Alexa by forcing developers to think outside the box. With more and more skills on the market, Amazon savvily adds hackathons with focused agendas and themes to guide developers towards a certain genre of skills. This year’s Hackathon tasks participants with creating an everyday-use-skill. 
The big concern for many, it seems, is privacy. Is Alexa listening to us all the time? Recently, Amazon filed a patent to allow Alexa to listen to people all the time. If the technology is implemented, it will mainly be used to catch key words (like "love" or "hate") to figure out what people like or dislike and make suggestions accordingly. 
Though this technology is not yet installed on Amazon's devices, Alexa does store voice recordings of what users say after the "wake word" activates the device. While Apple's Siri anonymizes users' recordings and deletes them after six months, Alexa stores them until the user chooses to delete them. This means that if a user is hacked — or much more likely, someone else gains login access to their Amazon account — their browsing behaviors and recordings can be accessed.
A couple of solutions for this are found in a USA Today article by Kim Komando. Komando suggests turning off Echo’s mic to prevent Alexa from eavesdropping, turning off voice purchasing or setting a PIN code for purchases to secure money transactions, and definitely checking “Drop-In” settings to ensure that no one else is listening to your conversations. 
Amazon claims that Alexa's always-listening technology may never hit the market. "We do not use customers’ voice recordings for targeted advertising," said an Amazon spokesperson in an official statement. "Like many companies, we file a number of forward-looking patent applications that explore the full possibilities of new technology. Patents take multiple years to receive and do not necessarily reflect current developments to products and services."

Electronics manufacturer Sony is partnering with Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science (SCS) to advance research in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. According to an April 18 press release, the research partnership will focus on designing robots specifically to carry out food service industry tasks, like preparing and serving food. 
Why food? The ultimate goal isn't to replace chefs and servers with robots but to push the boundaries of what robotics can accomplish. 
"Making and serving food is an immense challenge for automation, so we’re excited about the types of machines and software that might emerge as we jointly explore a variety of approaches and solutions,” said Dean of SCS Andrew Moore. “Both Sony and Carnegie Mellon University aim high, so we are confident this research will produce technologies that impact robotics across a broad number of applications.”
Software and hardware that can move around kitchens and handle ingredients will be able to navigate other kinds of small, busy spaces and work with any delicate materials, even those with irregular shapes. These skills could be applicable in other settings, including homes and offices as well as manufacturing.
The partnership will primarily be housed at SCS and led by Carnegie Mellon faculty. The Sony half will be directed by Dr. Hiroaki Kitano, who is the CEO of Sony Computer Science Laboratories.
“This project has the potential to make the vast possibilities of AI and robotics more familiar and accessible to the general public,” Kitano said. "Additionally, it could also assist those for whom daily tasks, such as food preparation, are challenging.  I am very excited to be working with the talented scientists at Carnegie Mellon University to make this vision a reality.”

Robots are becoming ubiquitous in industry. But, they’ve been held back from their full potential because they are difficult to incorporate into existing procedures: it’s too expensive to rebuild an entire assembly line to add in a robot. My goal is to make robots easier to use than Legos so anyone can build up a custom robot.
I’d like to be able to carry around a bag of robot modules, like joints, links, and grippers. Then, when I know what I want a robot to do, I’d tell the computer, and it would output the blueprints for a robot. I’d build a robot, and it would automatically know how to behave, like walk away, move around objects, or fasten screws.
Right now, I am focusing on automatically generating the design of robot arms specialized for a given job. For instance, I’m working with NASA to help design arms for future extraplanetary rovers. My algorithm synthesizes arms iteratively: it looks at how well the current robot can achieve its task, such as reaching a set position or exerting forces on the environment. Then, using the robot’s equations of motion, the algorithm calculates what change in the current design would help the robot complete its task more efficiently. I look for robots that have fewer joints: while robots with fewer joints may be less capable of doing arbitrary tasks than robots with many joints, robots with fewer joints are lighter, cheaper, and easier to control. In time, I hope to expand past designing a single limb at a time to designing entire robots.
Last year, I worked on making a modular legged robot walk away after you build it, generating its behavior using a layered approach. My approach included first finding a gait (the cycle of motions the robot should go through to move in the right direction), then adding onto this a layer of compliance, which prescribes how the robot should change its motions to adapt to variations in terrain. Lastly, a higher-level human or artificial intelligence planner would tell the robot how to navigate through the world.
A new modular paradigm could transform how robots are used across many domains, so that robots are viewed as customizable tools rather than monolithic entities. A search and rescue team might look at a disaster site, and build up a custom robot to go in and help survey or deliver supplies. A space mission could have a use for many different robots, but be limited in the amount of weight they can launch, which could be solved by using a set of multi-purpose robot modules. A small business owner might need to use robots to stay competitive, but need to adapt their robots to a process that changes frequently.
Making robots readily customizable will bring costs down, while increasing the scope of what robots can do and making them accessible to new users. I’m excited to be part of a movement to democratize robotics.

Massive study puts numbers to STEM gender gap
In a comprehensive new study, researchers from the University of Melbourne determined the gender gap in research throughout the STEM world. After analyzing 36 million authors listed on over 10 million scientific articles, they calculated the numerical disparity between men and women in nearly all fields of science and medicine in over 100 countries.
Senior researchers (for example, first authors) were more likely to be men, and junior researchers were more likely to be women. Wealthy countries like Japan and Germany had significantly bigger gender gaps than developing countries. Of the fields of study analyzed, 20 percent were very close to gender parity (within five percent).
The data has been made public online, so that decision makers can use it to keep informed.

Features on Pluto's moon Charon get names
When the New Horizons probe passed Pluto's moon Charon in 2015, it took the first clear photos of the moon, revealing features on its surface — craters, mountains, and ravine-like formations called chasmas. Now, many of Charon's features have received official names from the International Astronomical Union.
Charon's craters were named after legendary explorers, including Revati of the Indian epic Mahabharata, and Nemo for Jules Verne's fictional submarine captain. Chasmas were named after ships of myths and legend: Argo, Caleuche, and Manjet
Charon's mountains received the names of real-life pioneers of science fiction, including Octavia Butler, Stanley Kubrick, and Arthur C. Clarke.

"True seals" like harbor seals and harp seals retain the claws that helped their ancestors hunt on land. These claws are not just remnants of the past; they actively help these modern seals in their ocean hunting, marine biologists reported April 18 in Royal Society Open Science.
The biologists, led by David Hocking from Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, spent hundreds of hours observing wild seals hunting in Scotland and watching seals eat in captivity.
The true seals relied heavily on their claws to hunt and eat, resembling the use of claws in land hunters like bears. Claws let true seals hunt bigger prey, the researchers concluded. They caught prey underwater and tore it apart when they surfaced, as opposed to seals and sea lions who lack claws and tend to pursue prey that they can swallow whole and immediately, like small fish.

Ravens derail LIGO data collection
At the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), scientists noticed an unusual signal that didn't resemble the gravitational waves LIGO was designed to detect.
When LIGO scientists investigated, they found that the signal was the sound of pecking birds, picked up by a microphone meant to monitor LIGO's environment.
The pecking sound was from ravens, who had been pecking at an outdoor cooling pipe. The birds were snacking on the ice crystals forming on the outside of the pipe to get some cool relief from the heat.
The setup has since been altered so that the pipes will no longer accumulate ice.

Taking place in Rangos Ballroom in the Cohon Center last week, Scotch’n’Soda’s Spring Carnival show Chicago was one of the most thrilling events of the year and stunned audience members with high energy dance numbers, wonderful singing, and an all-around entertaining show. Directed by junior and computational finance major Adam Lerner and first-year Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences student Maxine Ewing, this production was beautifully done with a simplistic set, high quality music, and great utilization of the space.
The set featured two black curved platforms on each side of the stage rimmed with bright light bulbs that entranced guests with lighting cues that matched each elaborate number. In the center, the instrumentalists sat on raked steps with black and white designed music stands. It was truly an immersive experience for audience members to witness.
The show, taking place in 1920s Chicago, features two similar women, Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly, who have each murdered their lovers. They attempt to gain publicity through choice words and actions in front of Chicago judges and the public. Featuring some raunchy numbers and hilarious characters, this has to be one of the most beloved Broadway shows.
The numbers were all high energy with elaborately choreographed routines by senior biology and chemistry double major Sarah Deluty, sophomore music student Emmi Dolph, and sophomore and decision sciences and engineering and public policy major Molly Rohrer. With spectacular attention to detail in body movement, this choreography captured the 1920s essence that was very entertaining to watch.
The equally amazing musicianship of musical directors, junior music student Caleb Glickman and sophomore music student Emma McAlister, brought the sound of Roxie and Velma’s world to life for audiences. The harmonies, intonation, and quality of each singer in the production was very well done and allowed the audience to feel like they wanted to get up and sing as well.
The costuming was terrifically done as well with all characters in black and white with the exception of the leads. Roxie, played by electrical & computer engineering senior Tara Stentz, sported a fire truck red dress whereas Velma, played by junior psychology and decision sciences double major Heather Graci, had on a stunning gold and black dress. The costuming fit well with the show as to not distract from the singing and dancing but rather to add flavor and interest to the production.
In total, the production was a smash hit with lines out the door of people swaiting to get a glimpse of this wonderfully talented cast. All in all, it was a successful production of Chicago done by Carnegie Mellon’s Scotch’n’Soda at this year’s Spring Carnival.

For this year’s Carnival Concert, artists Wale and Shlohmo were the main performers. This was a highly anticipated concert, especially since many seemed to be interested in the pairing of Shlohmo’s electronic music with Wale’s rap music. Wale is a rapper well known for his feel-good sampling and remixes of popular songs; some of his tracks remind me of Kanye West’s music. Shlohmo, on the other hand has more of a relaxed and soothing vibe to his music, incorporating very unique sounds and beats to his songs. Before the concert, I had never heard of Shlohmo, and I only knew of the song “MY PYT” by Wale. I was excited to hear more of their music and learn more about both of the artists.
My friend and I arrived a little bit before 7 p.m. to find a spot up close to the stage. During that time, we were both really excited to have fun and dance to new music. We had been talking to others in line who were already fans of Wale, and they talked about how different his rap music was from other famous artists. I don’t think, however, we had met anyone who knew of Shlohmo before the event. While waiting for the concert to start, it was awesome seeing Activities Board (AB) Tech test out all the lights and effects. Having a spot all the way upfront near the stage, the lights were definitely blinding and the fog machines were very much in-your-face, however it all added to my and my friend’s excitement for the concert.
Over an hour passed and there were still no performers on stage. All the stage effects were still being used and loud music was playing, making the Cut resemble a stuffy 
night club. It seemed like half the audience was getting annoyed waiting for someone to perform, while the other half didn’t care and danced to the pop and rap music AB Tech put on. Overall, many people were just very confused, including me and my friend.
At some point during the concert, someone came on stage (who was neither Shlohmo nor Wale) and started playing electronic music. However, nobody knew that he was Com Truise, another DJ, because no one came out to introduce him. For another hour or so Com Truise continued playing music while many still appeared to be confused, wondering where Wale or Shlohmo were. By around 9 p.m. Wale came on stage and the entire audience cheered. It was nice to see that most of the audience still had so much energy and excitement, because, honestly at that point, I was already tired.
I did enjoy Wale’s music and he performed fun, upbeat songs like “My Love” featuring Major Lazer, Wizkid, and Dua Lipa, and 2009 throwback song “Chillin” featuring Lady Gaga. For a bit, I was able to dance and have a good time, but very quickly the area near the stage became packed with people and there was barely any space to move. At one point, a good number of people around me fell down because people began pushing. The whole environment and atmosphere of the concert became really uncomfortable, so my friend and I decided to leave. Even though my Carnival Concert experience wasn’t ideal, at least I was introduced to some new good music; Wale’s performance and songs definitely made up for everything else.

Last Thursday, Carnegie Mellon’s Activities Board (AB) went back to its tradition of hosting a major act during their Carnival Comedy show. Unlike its experiment with a series of comedy acts last year, this spring, AB brought the acclaimed Chris Gethard to the cozy stage of McConomy auditorium. Gethard is best known for hosting his own talk show, called The Chris Gethard Show, which takes place in New York City. Opening for Gethard was Tim Dillon, who was featured in a list written by the Rolling Stone as one of the “10 Comedians You Need to Know.” The packed auditorium was in for an eventful night, which took place over the course of two hours.
The night started off with newly announced AB comedy chair, freshmen chemistry major Jon Goodstein throwing free baseball caps to an excited and loud audience. When Dillon shortly came on stage, the self-described gay comedian joked that colleges were “wasting parents’ money on comedy.” The comment acted as a sort of prelude to Dillon’s personality throughout the first part of the show. From calling a whole row of drama majors in the audience future Panera bread workers to labeling cruises as simply “floating buffet[s],” Dillon exerted himself as someone who is not afraid to speak his mind. While bold, his statements were oftentimes backed by rationalization, which took the form of boisterous rants. As he made many amusing jabs at society, Dillon did not shy away from self-deprecatory humor. He said that once, his friends told him he looked like “Steve Bannon driving a Lyft.” Dillon also had the ability to talk at great speeds, which instilled plenty of  robust energy throughout the first part of the show.
Afterward, Dillon gave way to Gethard, who proved to be the star of the night. Although having a softer voice than Dillon, Gethard was more skillful at pacing his talk and had a genius for storytelling. While both comedians were able to incorporate the audience into their act, Gethard had a particularly funny and memorable interaction to share. Prior to the show, Gethard received an Instagram message from one of the audience members, who appeared to be an avid fan of the comedian. Gethard described how he nearly had a heart attack when the the sender said that she was the only one in line for the show, minutes before it was set to start. However, Gethard’s fear proved to be wrong, as he was embraced by a receptive audience throughout the night.
During the second part of the show, Gethard touched on a variety of topics, from his perception of Pittsburgh as an industrial city with a hipster vibe to an amusing pun on his last name. A major part of the show, however, dealt with Gethard’s experiences as he was growing up in New Jersey. In an initially heartwarming tale from his high school years, Gethard talked about how his anger at a bully gave his 13-year-old self the drive to achieve his goals later on in life. However, Gethard then apologized to the audience for the not-so-inspirational story, as he disclosed the infuriating fact that his high school bully went on to become richer, and could afford more expensive horses than the comedian. Gethard also talked about his acceptance that he never will fit into society’s definition of being “cool.” His self-disclosure would transition into a recollection of what he had felt to be his “coolest moment” in life. In an effort to say “something cool” in front of his friend one night, 16-year-old Gethard unabashedly admitted to his strict father that he and his friend that he and his friend “have been drinking [beers] all night long.” While his stories revealed a more serious theme concerning the struggles of his adolescence, Gethard maintained the hilarity of the show with his upbeat personality.
Gethard’s ability to tease out humor in any topic also shines through his discussion of many normally depressing topics, including rudeness of some hurried New Yorkers, the harmful effects of cultural stereotypes, as well as the stress behind the way gun issues in America are being framed as solely mental health issues. The comedian also went into more lighthearted, but stranger topics, from a friend’s sexual experimentation with a couch to the terrifying thrills of Gatorland, an amusement park in Florida dedicated to the crude feeding of animals to alligators. It appears that his entire life could be one large comedy show, but much of Gethard’s ability to engage his audience can be attributed to his knack for vividly recreating the past, as well as his effortless skill at impersonating different kinds of people.
Indeed, by the end of the show, the self-described “grown-up version” of Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes left a roaring and satisfied audience, signalling a success for this year’s Activities Board Carnival Comedy committee.

It’s that time of the year again — when Carnegie Mellon students pick up their drills and strap on their hardhats to build booths. Booth is one of the biggest attractions of Spring Carnival, featuring multistory structures, interactive games, and beautiful decorations. After unrelenting weather among other challenges, Carnegie Mellon’s Greek and student organizations persevered to build booths centered on this year’s theme, Myths and Legends. These organizations compete in four categories: Sorority, Fraternity, Independent, and Blitz. Participating but not competing, Alpha Phi Omega built a Greek Underworld-themed concession stand, where all proceeds went to fundraising the service fraternity.
One of the biggest sorority booths was Kappa Alpha Theta’s Titanic. Built to resemble the iconic ship, the two-story booth featured elaborate decorations: a spiral staircase, paintings of the characters from the 1997 movie of the same name, and jellyfish lighted with eerie green lighting. The booth did a wonderful job telling a story, and combined the experience with a digital escape room game; you entered as a passenger on the Titanic, walking through the main “lobby” of the ship and up the staircase. Red lighting and fire cutouts signaled that the ship was on fire and going down, as visitors walked down the stairs into the briny green ocean. Exiting the booth meant you successfully escaped the ship and survived. Kappa Alpha Theta won second place for their Titanic booth.
Right next door was Alpha Phi’s Narnia. This booth told the story of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, from The Chronicles of Narnia by C. S. Lewis. With large 3D paintings of characters like Aslan and the White Witch, the booth showcased Alpha Phi’s incredible art and design skills. On the second floor, visitors could play a shooting game with a toy bow and arrow, participating in Aslan’s final battle against the Witch. The many elaborate decorative chairs and a small swing decorated with flowers and butterflies made the booth a popular photo spot for Carnival visitors.
The first place winner of the sorority booths, Kappa Kappa Gamma’s Alice in Wonderland, was a sight to be seen. Beautifully painted and fun, the two-story booth featured a wall of roses, referencing the Queen of Heart’s rose obsession, a room lighted by black light to simulate the craziness of Wonderland, and a short interactive game where the player would collect items as Alice. Kappa Kappa Gamma’s hard work payed off with their impressive display.
Delta Delta Delta built a booth featuring the Greek god of the sea, Poseidon. With an impressive painting of the god of the ocean at the entrance, the one-story booth told a fun tale of ocean-themed Greek mythology. The booth also featured a ring toss game, where the player would toss rings onto a coral sculpture. If the player won, they got to walk out with a small prize: a laser-cut dolphin. 
The last of the sorority booths was Delta Gamma’s Santa’s Workshop. Cleverly decorated with small pieces of plywood to create a brick wall, the cheerful booth made the recent snow less miserable. With cute cutouts of Santa’s reindeer, colorful Christmas lights and a Christmas tree, Delta Gamma brought back the spirit of Christmas to Carnival.
One of the biggest fraternity booths was Alpha Epsilon Pi’s Star Trek. Emblazoned with a Star Trek-themed logo and the show’s iconic USS Enterprise, the booth featured a number of tech-based displays. The bottom floor had an impressive transporter bay, while the top floor featured an incredible interactive game. The elaborate booth placed second place in the fraternity category. 
Just across Midway was Phi Delta Theta’s Moon Landing. This booth was an especially popular one due to its green screen photo booth and two-story-tall rocket. 
Proudly displaying the organization’s flag and many of its members photoshopped as astronauts, the booth featured incredible artwork and created a fun, cohesive theme. Next door was Alpha Sigma Phi’s The Sandlot. Based off of the movie of the same name, the small single-story booth was a fun baseball-themed game. Even though they were partially deterred by the previous nights of terrible weather, the booth was fun and extremely popular with kids.
Another two-story fraternity booth was Sigma Phi Epsilon’s Legend of Zelda. Using artwork inspired by the various Legend of Zelda games, the booth incorporated interactivity into its decorations. Using a small Zelda-decorated coin, the visitor could interact with objects in the booth, causing them to light up or make a sound. The booth was beautifully decorated with faux stained glass windows and sculptures of Zelda-themed enemies, and featured a small video game on the second floor. The booth placed third in the fraternity category.
The winner of the fraternity category was Delta Tau Delta’s Harry Potter booth. Built to resemble part of Hogwarts castle, the booth took the visitor on a journey through the many locations in the world of Harry Potter. From Ollivander’s to the halls of Hogwarts to a running fountain on the second floor to paintings of the iconic characters, the booth was incredibly well-designed and well-built. One of the many cool aspects was an interactive plate sorted visitors into Hogwarts houses.
Located at the entrance of Midway was KGB’S Aliens booth. Single story, it featured conspiracy-related decorations and articles, all pointing towards the existence of alien life. Coming to the exit of the booth was an Operation-based alien game, where the player could extract miscellaneous objects from the body of an alien. KGB members were expert participants, quickly crafting tin foil hats to protect their visitors from potential dangers — alien or otherwise.
Fringe built a Robin Hood-themed booth, with a beautiful banner and cut-outs of the animated movie’s characters decorating the front of the booth. You walked through Robin Hood’s forest, passing by sculptures of trees and even more beautifully painted characters, exploring the world of the movie. The booth also featured a shooting game, where the player could use a bow and arrow to hit targets mounted on the wall. Although they didn’t place, the booth was fun and well-designed.
Second place in the Independent category was Student Dormitory Council’s (SDC) Trojan Horse. Decorated with the enormous head of the Trojan horse itself, the booth was one impressive game. As you passed by Greek-themed urns and pots, the visitor could read up on the tale of the Trojan horse. In one game, the player could use small cutouts to simulate the battle. In the other game, the player could use a nerf gun to hit timed targets. The SDC’s hard work resulted in an impressive and entertaining booth.
The Singapore Students Association (SSA) built a Merlion booth. With the head of lion on one side of the entrance and the tail of a mermaid on the other, the booth was covered wall-to-wall with blackboard. Visitors could draw and decorate the booth using chalk provided by SSA, which resulted in a colorful array of messages and doodles. Along the walls were lit-up laser-cut sculptures of the ocean and other Merlion-related locations. In the center of the booth was a small sandpit, which was popular with kids and families.
Winning first place in the Independent category was the Taiwanese Student Association’s Arabian Nights booth. Complete with sand, a magic carpet, the soundtrack of Aladdin, and a blue genie, the booth took the visitor on a trip through Agrabah. With its elaborately painted decorations, the booth really told the story of Aladdin and wonderfully encompassed the world of the theme.
The last Independent booth was the Asian Students Association’s (ASA) The Legend of Korra. This booth told the story of the animated series using a variety of lights and sculptures, taking the visitor on a journey through the streets of the main city and into the spirit world. Featuring a fun game where the player could “bend” evil spirits into good ones and a cute tea party-themed photo op by the exit, ASA earned third place with their exciting booth.
The last category is Blitz. Where other booths are allowed to bring in already-built frames and pieces, Blitz booths cannot pre-build anything. Starting only a couple days before opening, these booths expertly managed time and weather to create single-story structures.
The Chinese Students Association built a booth on the theme of China’s Great Wall. Beautifully decorated with Ancient Chinese-themed art and motifs, the booth was impressively designed and painted. 
The American Society of Civil Engineers built an Area 51 themed booth, located at the end of Midway. While small, the booth featured a “conspiracy map”, with tacks placed where all of Carnegie Mellon’s affiliated schools were located (including Central Michigan University). Visitors could look through a periscope to see the rest of Midway, as a form of surveillance. But, most entertaining was the booth’s wall of index cards — each with a different “conspiracy” on them. Featuring theories such as “Water is wet” and “The real Avril Lavigne is Dead,” the wall was a fun way to incorporate visitor participation. The playful booth won second place in the Blitz category.
Winning third place was Astronomy Club’s Constellations-themed booth. The main attraction of the booth was its large wall-to-wall video game, where two people played as spaceships trying to track down the correct constellation. Decorated with amazing artwork of constellations and celestial bodies, the Astronomy club showed off their art and technical skills. Kappa Sigma’s booth was built on the legend of The Yeti. Impressive in its own right, the booth featured “cool” artwork and a well-designed structure. Along with their theme, the organization sold ice cream to passing Carnival visitors.
Winning first place in the Blitz category was Math Club’s Merlin’s Quest booth. With the story of Merlin’s multiple quests written on the walls, visitors could decode Merlin’s messages using a variety of historical ciphers. Once the many messages were decoded and the puzzles solved, the visitor could “pull” the sword in the stone out of its boulder to reveal 
collectible stickers. The booth rightfully won first place with its clever games and fun design.
The winner of the fraternity category was Delta Tau Delta’s Harry Potter booth. Built to resemble part of Hogwarts castle, the booth took the visitor on a journey through the many locations in the world of Harry Potter. From Ollivander’s to the halls of Hogwarts to a running fountain on the second floor to paintings of the iconic characters, the booth was incredibly well-designed and well-built.

The Day of Silence, started in 1996 at the University of Virginia and organized by the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network (GLSEN), is observed annually in the United States and many other countries and serves to acknowledge those in the LGBTQ+ community who have been harassed or bullied due to their identities.
“Breaking the Silence” with their Open Mic Night on Thursday, April 26, CMU ALLIES wishes for members of the community to showcase their identities through poetry, music, and other performances following their annual Day of Silence event in order to, as they stated on their Facebook page, “spotlight the challenges that marginalized groups silently face and speak out about them, in a sense breaking the silence of Day of Silence.”
As Carnegie Mellon’s LGBTQ+ organization, ALLIES strives to bring the community together and make the campus more inclusive. According to their website, “We are ALLIES because we are not a single mass; we are all ALLIED with each other through supporting our own individual lives and experiences.” With events throughout the year such as Open Mic Nights, visibility and awareness days, the Westboro Baptist Church counter-protest, and more, they bring awareness to issues regarding gender and orientation.
In addition to LGBTQ+ issues, ALLIES “encourages performers to focus on the different aspects of their identity” at the Open Mic Night this Thursday, including race and religion. If interested, “Breaking the Silence” will take place from 8 to 9:30 p.m. in the Cohon Center Studio Theater on Thursday. Additionally, if anyone has questions or wishes to perform on Thursday, contact allies.open.mic@gmail.com.
ALLIES also hosts social events and has weekly meetings on Wednesdays at 5 p.m. in Soho, Cohon Center Room 335, and holds open office hours for those who need support.

Dear Izzy,
Sadly, Carnival is over and done, but school is not. I completely did not expect how much work I still had to do, and now it’s Sunday and I’m not only hungover but absolutely drowning in work. Everything feels like it’s coming around so soon, with final papers, exams, and pesky group projects and I have absolutely no idea what to do about it. It’s like, I’m trying to recover and get back to work this week but I don’t have the motivation, and I’ve also been trying to get on top of my work for so long, but I’m worried it’ll all come crashing down in the next two weeks. Do you have any advice to help me stay afloat?
Help! Under No Grade Obligations, Very Exasperated, Response?
Dear HUNGOVER,
Don’t worry, you’re almost there! Not that you didn’t know that already. But, here are some tips that’ll help you generate a final push to end the semester strong.
Schedule out those exam dates and due dates for projects, work a little bit on assignments and study different topics each day so you’re not cramming the day before, take a break during that studying when you need to, and so on. You’ve probably heard all those already. But, I also wanted to give you advice that’s a little bit different.
Be aware of what your body and mind need. If you are feeling hungry, take a break to get some food and eat while you work. If you’re feeling motivated or have a good idea, then great, stick to your work to get all those ideas out! If you’re tired, then dear God please just go to sleep. You’ll feel a lot better later because you’re getting what you need.
If you’re feeling stressed, please take a break — and don’t be afraid to reach out to friends if you need support. I am not sure what happened with you during Carnival, but I’m worried that the fact that you need to recover now means that something serious happened. Even if nothing did, talking to friends is always a good outlet for your stress. Everything will be okay in the end.
The most important thing is that whatever you’re feeling, don’t hold it in. Be upfront about things and don’t be afraid to confront challenges, because you’ll be able to focus a lot more on your work when you’ve gotten all your personal problems out of the way.
Hope this helps,
Izzy

This week I ventured to the North Shore to finally see the place, the myth, the legend: Tequila Cowboy. I had heard tales of the mechanical bulls, the karaoke, and the country music, and finally it was time for me to experience it for myself. Saddle up, because this place is definitely a wild ride.
The location: Tequila Cowboy, located on North Shore Drive is about as North Shore as you can get without getting in the water. It’s right down the street from PNC Park and conveniently placed on a long strip of bars. If you find yourself overwhelmed here, you can venture down McFadden’s, Bar Louie, or even the Southern Tier Brewing Co. (which I an dying to get to). You can also just stroll along the North Shore, but I guarantee if you pop in to Tequila Cowboy, you won’t just be staying for one drink.
The drinks: As you may know by now, I have a tradition of buying one expensive drink at a bar before resorting to a typical mixed drink or cheap beer just so I can say I’ve had one of the bar’s signature drinks. This weekend was no different and Tequila Cowboy did not disappoint. No, I did not have tequila, because I am still abstaining from that devil drink since Bakersfield, so I opted for a mule. Tequila Cowboy’s mule features fresh pureed ginger which made them way too easy to drink. I tried the Nashville Mule with Old Camp Peach Pecan Whiskey, ginger puree, lime, sprite, and soda water. Of course mules are expensive, so I knew what I was getting into here, but the mixed drinks and beer weren’t too bad in price and taste.
The vibe: There’s a mechanical bull here, do I even need to say more? No, I didn’t get on it because as you can imagine, the line is a bit crazy on a Saturday night, but I had a great time watching others fall off. Growing up in Texas and going to the rodeo to see the real bull rides almost every year, I did feel like it was my responsibility to represent my state well, so maybe you’ll catch me up there next time. There’s also a back section of the bar that feels a bit separate from the front which houses karaoke and a separate bar. Both halves of the bar were equally as exciting and definitely worth stopping by.
Lit or nah: I don’t know if it’s possible for a bar with a mechanical bull not to be lit. It’s also huge and was completely packed so it definitely passes the lit-mus test. If you’re not a country fan, this might not be your place, but honestly it’s so loud that you don’t even realize country music is playing most of the time. There’s also the separate karaoke area that is playing whatever song people are currently singing. From the drinks to the music to the atmosphere, Tequila Cowboy is really a place that lets you grab life by the horns.

April 20 marks the seven-month anniversary of the day Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico. Those following the crisis might know about the fundraising work of junior and decision science major Rosana Guernica and her team, which resulted in several chartered flights to the island that brought supplies and evacuated medical patients who couldn’t receive treatment on the island because there was inadequate power. Though they received quite a bit of recognition for their initial fundraising efforts, they have never stopped helping the island.
In an interview with The Tartan, three members of the team — Guernica, along with Gabriel Ostolaza, a masters student in the College of Engineering, and Paloma Hernandez, a junior in BXA — described the current issues facing Puerto Rico and the areas they are focusing on in their volunteer work, which they are formalizing into a nonprofit complete with a donated office space.
Guernica’s fundraising efforts are still going strong, even seven months after the storm. This month, Pittsburgh Filmmakers held a fundraiser event for her work, with Pittsburgh mayor Bill Peduto and San Juan mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, where they screened a documentary about the team’s work to help the island. In total, they raised $5,500 for their upcoming projects.
When I asked the team members to describe the island’s situation today, they came to a consensus that there seemed to be a new normal taking hold. “People are going back to their regular lives as much as they can — they’re going back to school, to work,” said Guernica. “But, it’s really different from how our home usually is, like half the traffic lights don’t work...it’s just a new normal that everyone’s accepted,” she noted.
Ostolaza points out that because of this, the media spotlight has not been on the island as much because people seem to be going back to their normal lives, despite the fact that it is not a good normal. Hernandez further states that morale is still low because of the conditions on the island. There are still thousands of islanders who have had no power since Irma or Maria, and the electrical grid is still quite unstable — the day before the interview, the entire island went into a blackout that lasted for about a day.
As Puerto Rico has shifted out of emergency response mode and into recovery mode, so have the team’s projects. A more recent project was helping people who wanted or needed to return to the island but couldn’t travel commercially. For instance, they helped two girls who were bedridden with microcephaly return to the island. The girls were forced to leave the mainland, because their family couldn’t afford out-of-pocket treatment and were denied Medicaid and other healthcare benefits.
Another critical issue regarding Puerto Rico is the housing issues facing the hurricane’s survivors. On the island, residents are having trouble getting government aid because many of them could not prove that they owned their homes, as a lot of ownership information had never been formalized. Guernica recalled the story of a family in Puerto Rico — the family home used to belong to the grandmother before she passed away. She left the house to her daughter but never formalized this in a written will, which created a host of bureaucratic problems for the family.
The housing issues extend to the island’s evacuees on the mainland as well. This past Monday, 22 families currently staying in Philadelphia were notified that their Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) assistance would run out on Friday, April 20, and so they would be evicted. Returning to the island wasn’t an option, because their homes have not been rebuilt. The families couldn’t find jobs in Philadelphia, because the city has taken in so many Puerto Rican evacuees, and public housing in Philadelphia wasn’t an option either as they had decade-long waiting lists.
The day of the interview, Guernica was anxiously contacting various nonprofit organizations in hopes of relocating them to Pittsburgh, away from the housing crisis in Philadelphia. Fortunately, as CBS News correspondent David Begnaud reported, FEMA decided at the last minute to extend temporary shelter assistance to May 14, giving these families some breathing room.
The team also has two longer-term projects planned, both of which are focused on addressing problems that plagued the island after the hurricane. One of the projects was motivated by the severe communication outage Puerto Rico faced in the initial days after the hurricane. “People could not communicate with each other; the government couldn’t communicate with anybody...we actually lost a lot of lives [due to this lack of communication] because people were throwing themselves into the street to find their families and they were getting in the way of the first responders,” Ostolaza explained.
Chaos reigned; although a curfew was put into place, in practice, many people didn’t obey it because understandably, they were so anxious to find their missing loved ones. Thus, a conception Guernica’s team has for their next project is to use drones to implement an emergency communication system that will connect the major cities together even when the primary power and communications grids are down. In the private meeting the team had with Mayor Cruz when she visited Carnegie Mellon, Cruz seemed especially excited about this communication system, according to Guernica.
The other project focuses on addressing individual emergency preparedness. “A lot of people. ..just didn’t have the information necessary to prepare well,” Guernica said. Thus, they aim to distribute waterproof emergency preparation boxes. They will contain instructions on what type of food to buy, and can be used to store important documents and credit cards, as well as supplies such as matches that one wouldn’t want to get wet.
The effects of the hurricane in Puerto Rico is an evolving story, and it is far from being back to normal.
“We still need help, and there’s a lot more Americans can do,” Ostolaza said. Besides donating to causes that support the island, Americans can “educate themselves on what’s happening,” he said, which can happen with something as simple as a Google search, and could lead to figuring out potential ways to help. Guernica hopes that people realize that anyone can do what they are doing with enough willpower — the team primarily consists of students who are in their late teens or early twenties who are simultaneously functioning as students.
Although many call these students angels and heroes for their work, the sadness at the past and worry for the future runs strong among the team members. “It’s fun and it’s great to be recognized, but...you never think about being recognized,” Ostolaza said. “It’s not like we crossed the finish line, and we’re celebrating,” added Guernica. “We are worried sick [and] depressed. After we finished our trips, it really sunk in with a lot of us. And, since we were no longer in emergency response mode, we started to mourn what happened to our island...On our last trip, three people almost died,” she said, with audible emotion. “It feels like it’s just a grain of sand,” Hernandez stated.
For the team, the nature of the people on the island is a silver lining. They described the people as resilient and determined to rebuild. People helped each other even when they had little for themselves. Hernandez recalled that when she was on the island, locals would ask her if she needed anything; she was shocked at this as the locals still had so many unmet needs. When the team was on the island, Ostolaza’s mom would cook for all ten team members — even though she only had a single working stovetop, she still managed to cook up rice, beans, plantains, and chicken. “The Puerto Rican spirit gives me hope,” said Guernica.

Driving a green car, an older car, and most recently, a blue car. The identity of Carnegie Mellon’s very own Scranton Strangler, or better yet, Mellon Masturbator, remains elusive to this day. With six distinct incidents occurring in the span of two years, these instances of indecent exposure have raised numerous concerns among the students at Carnegie Mellon University.
With the first of this string of events occurring on March 19, 2016, and the most recent on April 11, 2018, the consistency of these crimes has boggled and worried various students and parents thereof.
“Now six of these since 2016, is that a lot? It’s significant in that it’s got everyone’s attention. What actually gets everyone’s attention, which I’m happy about, is the safety alerts,” says Chief Thomas Ogden of the Carnegie Mellon police department.
Ogden assures that the Carnegie Mellon police department is doing everything in their power to apprehend these criminals. However, the various descriptions given to the police indicate no similarities or trends among the unknown number of suspects leading to further difficulty in the investigation. Descriptions range from a 20 year-old to a six-foot bald man. The only similarity amongst the various suspects is that they are all male.
Another barrier for the Carnegie Mellon police is their strict adherence to their jurisdiction. Working with the University of Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh police, the Carnegie Mellon police department patrols and protects a very specific area within Pittsburgh, namely Carnegie Mellon’s campus. Only the most recent reported instance lies within Carnegie Mellon’s police jurisdiction.
“The only one of these six that we have any jurisdiction in is the most recent one, the other ones, we don’t have any police powers there,” says Chief Ogden. “The crime alerts we sent out, some of them, are relative to things that happened way off-campus. They’re areas that the students frequent, so I just want to make sure you know that this area and the South Side, there was a problem and just be careful, you know, act accordingly,” he continues.
The best and most helpful approach to anyone who experiences similar crimes is immediate action.
“In the moment, the best thing to do is call immediately,” says Chief Ogden. “It’s the delay that hurts. In cases like this, our average response time is exceptional. We’re out there all the time on campus and around the campus so if we get the call, there’s a much better chance we can do something.”
Ogden’s call for immediate action after a crime derives from the innate reaction people have after witnessing or being involved with a crime. People, including students at Carnegie Mellon, tend to wait after witnessing a crime, possibly out of shock or fear.
“It’s just a human nature thing, you’re busy, you got away from it, you think about it, maybe you tell a few people and then by the time the police get told there’s nothing for us to do immediately,” says Chief Ogden. “That’s common anywhere, people wait.”
Immediate reporting, even given a busy schedule, is an imperative step towards catching the many men at large  indecently  exposing themselves around Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh campus. Ogden attributes the motives of these men to several possibilities including mental health or impaired judgement.
“I’ve been doing this 39 years and these people have some issue obviously, whether they need attention, they have mental health issues,” Ogden stipulates. “Other instances people are intoxicated and they just do it. It’s varied, everyone’s different.”
The problem at hand does not, in any way, rest soundly with the Carnegie Mellon Police department. Their limitations, based on jurisdiction and the lack of detail and immediacy in reports, has made catching these criminals a challenging task. In the case that these crimes do move closer to campus, Ogden and the police department are prepared to take immediate action.
“If we had six [crimes occur] on campus, we’d be doing a number of things like stakeouts, video, unmarked cars, but unfortunately, these are all over the place at different times.”

Though perhaps not as well attended as the Wale concert or the Holi celebration, “From Enigma to AI: The Legacy of Pamela McCorduck and Joseph Traub at CMU,” was similarly an event this Carnival weekend that was flocked to by the public.
The panel discussing the donations of Pamela McCorduck to the University Libraries Special Collection and the legacy of former School of Computer Science head Joseph Traub may have deviated from the theme of myths and legends, but accomplished the mission of other Carnival events as it brought people from all parts of the university together to discuss historical computing.
McCorduck, an author who writes about artificial intelligence and women in technology, was married to the former head of the computer science department, the late Traub. Her contributions from the McCorduck-Traub collection to the library include many historical computation devices, from the first mechanical calculator that was commercially produced to rare books by Charles Babbage, the inventor of the analytical engine considered to be the first mechanical computing device.
A highlight of this donation, spotlighted by the title of the panel, was two Enigma machines. Enigma machines were used by Germany during World War II to encrypt wartime communication and were the focus of many decryption efforts by the British during the war.
“For one of the best schools of computer science in the world, a collection of ancestral machines seems a good marker of where the field has come from,” McCorduck said of her donation in a university press release.
The panel consisted of McCorduck, Andrew Moore, the Dean of the School of Computer Science, Julia Parsons, a Carnegie Institute of Technology graduate who worked as a codebreaker during World War II, Mary Shaw, a School of Computer Science professor, and Keith Webster, the Dean of the University Libraries. Parsons, when working as part of an all-women codebreaking team, was present when the transmission that led to the decryption of the German code was intercepted, and her contributions were honored during the panel.
Moore highlighted the importance of the history of computing to the current study of the discipline, stating in the Pittsburgh Tribune Review that he encourages all first-year computer science students to view the collection in order to show them that they can not just work at a big tech company but make something with a real impact on the world, adding that when one looks at the legacy of the machine, “We see people who took technology to save lives and save the world.” The Enigma machine, like much of the work coming out of the Software Engineering Institute today at Carnegie Mellon, had a military application.
The hope of the expansion of this collection is to expand the academic exploration of the computers of the 19th and the 20th century at Carnegie Mellon. It was announced at the panel by Webster that the libraries will be hiring a researcher to further examine their collection.
The Enigma machines that Carnegie Mellon have are some of the only ones of the 350 surviving devices that are on display to the public. The collection is located in the Rare and Fine Book room in Hunt Library, which will be open weekdays from 4 to 6 p.m. through the beginning of May.

Every year, the Pulitzer Prize awards notable achievements in newspaper, online journalism, literature, and musical composition in the United States. The Pulitzer Prize for Fiction is arguably the most well known, and hundreds of books compete for the coveted golden stamp. 
Yet this year, a lesser-known category has taken the spotlight: the Pulitzer Prize for Music. The prize was awarded to the album DAMN. by Kendrick Lamar, marking the first time a music Pulitzer was given to any work that wasn’t classical or jazz. 
Public reaction was mixed. Predictably, some reacted with derision. Various music critics turned up their noses at the genre and wrote scathing reviews. One critic from The Washington Post declared, “you can’t spell crap without rap.” While there is not enough space to list them all, there are surely other mocking reviews hidden in the snobby, antagonistic, and occasionally racist recesses of the internet. 
Others criticized the choice to award such a commercially successful piece. They acknowledge the album’s quality but question its fame, wary about giving the Pulitzer Prize to popular pieces of music. Zachary Woolfe, the classical music editor of The New York Times, detailed the heart of this anxiety, stating that the Pulitzer Prize “is now officially one fewer guaranteed platform…for noncommercial work, which scrapes by on grants, fellowships, commissions, and yes, awards.” 
To be fair, the difference in popularity is notable. Lamar’s DAMN. reached No. 1 on the pop chart and generated over two million dollars in revenue. The other finalists for the Pulitzer Prize were Michael Gilbertson, who wrote a string quartet, and Ted Hearne, who wrote a five-movement cantata. These pieces, while popular in their own right, definitely never made it onto the pop charts or into mainstream music consciousness and thus did not gain the same kind of financial success for the creator.
However, even though the anxiety is understandable, it is irrelevant to the goal of the Prize. Pulitzer Prizes should not yield to popularity, but they also shouldn't avoid it altogether. Sometimes the most deserving piece will also make the most money, and sometimes the second best piece will make no money at all; that’s life. If awards were granted based on how much the recipients needed the money, then they would lose meaning altogether. 
Fortunately, for every snobbish or anxious reaction there were ten positive ones. In an interview with The Washington Post, composer Alex Temple said, “A lot of people are very enthusiastic about Kendrick’s win, saying that it’s about time the Pulitzer moved beyond its limited focus on contemporary classical music and, for the most part, on work by white men.” 
The Atlantic agreed, stating, “The ability to hear hip-hop as brilliant music, period, is overdue for institutions and observers of all kind.” Similarly, Jon Pareles, the chief pop music critic for The New York Times, said, “if you ask me, it should have happened sooner.” Other publications have also chimed in with comparable sentiments, thrilled that the Pulitzers are opening up new doors and starting to appreciate all genres of music equally.
Regardless of which position you take, it’s safe to say that the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Music has prompted public dialogue. But it’s important to note that dialogue seems to center on the Pulitzers rather than the album. The story is not that Lamar won a Pulitzer Prize, but that the Pulitzers gave a prize to Lamar.
This is because the prize ultimately says more about the Pulitzers than Kendrick Lamar. Most critics recognized that the album was masterful; what surprised them was that the Pulitzers broke their unspoken rules in order to recognize that mastery. “The rapper’s win is probably more significant to the reputation of the prize itself than to the prize winner,” stated The Atlantic. “It almost feels as though the Pulitzers won a Kendrick Lamar, and not the other way around.” 
Indeed, the Pulitzers do seem to get the better end of the deal. Lamar gets recognition and accolades, but he was already famous, and the cash prize pales in comparison to the profit generated by the album. The Pulitzers, on the other hand, have been lauded as progressive. Their music prize is in the news for the first time in years. They refurbished their image over the course of a single voting session, transforming from antiquated institution to open-minded music authority.
But, how progressive are they really? They broke tradition to award Lamar, but why not award any of the other intelligent, layered, and dynamic hip-hop albums? It’s possible that timing is a factor. Popular conceptions of “acceptable” music genres are changing, and the Pulitzers may have felt pressured to move away from classical music before they were written off entirely. (This could also explain why they awarded DAMN. and not Lamar’s earlier and equally masterful album, To Pimp a Butterfly.)
Furthermore, the Pulitzers did not even consider Lamar’s album in the beginning. According to The Atlantic, “Lamar’s work entered the discussion once [the judging panel] realized that some of the modern classical artists they were evaluating bore clear hip-hop influence.” They consequently decided to go back to the source of that influence, and Lamar seemed the best place to start. 
So the timing had to be right, and the judges had to recognize hip-hop’s influence in other music before considering it on its own merits. It’s possible — likely, even — that other external factors crept into the supposedly impartial judging room. These factors lined up to catapult DAMN. to victory, but does that make the Pulitzers deserving of praise? 
Overall, Lamar’s DAMN. receiving the Pulitzer Prize for Music is a good thing. It’s just not necessarily a great thing. The Pulitzers can still do much more to acknowledge and award all types of music and other forms of creation. With any luck, the judges will realize that they should follow in the footsteps of their Prize recipient and be bold, be authentic, and be a pioneer all the time, not just when it suits them.

Last week, a letter to the editor was published that characterized one of our articles as propaganda and irresponsible reporting. I would like to respond on behalf of my writers who work incredibly hard for this paper to these frankly ludicrous claims, since, as news editor, I am responsible for the tone of our news section and not the individual writers who were cited.
I would like to say first that I disagree with Dury-Agri's critique of the Gingrich article, as I felt that the writers made it clear they were referring to the specific projects Gingrich cited in his article, including minimally invasive heart surgery and remote medical analysis, and not the research done at Carnegie Mellon as a whole. This is not to say that even those projects do not have potential downsides, but that I thought it was not an unreasonable stance to point out that equating (a word our copy staff debated over but ultimately decided was used correctly in the article) those projects to fracking was a false equivalency due to the established evidence of the harms that can be caused by fracking. 
It might have been interesting to discuss the potential downsides of the projects Gingrich visited, but ultimately the focus of the article was Gingrich’s piece for Fox. I take full responsibility if the article read as if the writers were trying to claim that the research coming from Carnegie Mellon was somehow flawless, but I know that it was not their intention and if that was not communicated, that comes from my failure as an editor.
While I think Dury-Agri's point about this individual article was unfounded, the larger point that he failed to make as he was busy picking apart a fine sentence in a good article might have been a real constructive contribution. We at The Tartan have a responsibility to turn a critical eye on the university on behalf of the campus community we wish to inform. I want to work hard at doing this, to welcome readers to point out the ways in which we could be serving the campus community better, and to urge those who agree with this mission to contribute to reporting.

Ask yourself, are you proud of your race?
I am. I am a proud Asian-American. Specifically, I am a proud Chinese-Filipino. I am proud of my rich heritage and want to speak of it and learn more about it. I freaked out over the teaser trailer for the movie adaptation of Crazy Rich Asians last Friday. Even amidst everything going on in the United States and its administration, I am a proud American.
Now, ask yourself, are you proud of your religion?
I’ve been a member of the Catholic church since being baptized as an infant. I’ve gone to Church every Sunday with my parents in one of my hometown’s various local churches. I’ve been an altar server, attended Confraternity of Christian Doctrine classes as a child, and participated as a Eucharistic Minister at my Catholic high school. At Carnegie Mellon, I still regularly attend mass at St. Paul’s Cathedral or the Pittsburgh Oratory every Sunday.
But, despite all of this, my racial pride still overtakes my religious pride.
When I first came to college, I wanted to be more in touch with my faith. One of my older, more devout friends joined the Newman Club at the University of Pennsylvania so I strived to find an extension of that at Carnegie Mellon. I was a little surprised to find that we share a Newman Club with the University of Pittsburgh. While I enjoyed the Newman Club talking about broader topics about the Christian faith and challenging me to examine my faith in general, I wasn’t a fan of their timeslot for the nightly meetings and had formed stronger connections with people from different on-campus organizations.
But, I guess I should ask first, do you even have a religion?
When you go on The Bridge and search for organizations about “faith," you pull up 15 organizations, such as the Interfaith Spirituality Embassy and the Tartan Athletic Fellowship. If you type in “religion,” you pull up six, overlapping clubs. Compared to the 403 organizations listed on The Bridge, those are incredibly small numbers.
I don’t want to admit it, but one of the bigger, unfortunate reasons that I also phased out of the Newman Club was that none of the friends I hung out with most of the time were very religious. When I’d mention my faith to them, they’d joke around saying, “God, I haven’t been to Church in a long time,” just nodding and accepting this big part of my life. There was really no further discussion to be had, since they didn’t really have a strong stance on it. Or, they were atheists.
It’s a lot easier to talk about race in America than religion in America. It is because race is so easily identifiable and physical, while religion is much more personal and intimate. Additionally, certain religions have stronger associations with different races and political parties. Speaking from what I know, Filipinos are known to be strong, devout Catholics with religion heavily tied into a large portion of their daily life and the country’s culture. This also applies to the Irish and Hispanics. The most popular of these associations are white Christians, whether they be Catholic, Protestant, or — the most radical and loud of them all — Evangelical Protestant. 
In an article published on FiveThirtyEight, 38 percent of young adults are not affiliated with any sort of religion. While the article mainly focuses on the decline of white Evangelicals (and quite honestly also could mean that the participants in the study were mostly white), it is that 38 percent of religiously unaffiliated individuals that is striking because of its sharp difference compared to other age groups. It considered the thought that religion and faith systems are dying out.
While I’ve formed incredibly strong connections and friendships with religiously unaffiliated students here at Carnegie Mellon, there is something special about the bond you have with someone who also shares a faith — either the same one I have or a religion that’s completely different. There’s that belief in something higher and greater. We’d be better equipped to have a larger conversation about religion. But we don’t.
I want to clarify that the last thing I want to do is criticize someone for not having a faith. In fact, I’d enjoy knowing more and learning from them so I can challenge my own faith to make it stronger. Although, conversations about religion might be challenging, they are undoubtedly rewarding and introspective. Maybe it’s because we’re trying to avoid creating more stigmas that relate religion with a specific race, but in doing so, we’re sacrificing the chance to have a more open conversation to possibly break down those stigmas for good.

On May 29, Starbucks will close 8,000 of its stores for “racial bias training.” Yes, it’s 2018 and, yes, this is an actual headline that has graced the covers of various news outlets over the past week. 
The incident that sparked this action occurred in a Philadelphia Starbucks restaurant where two black men sat at a table without purchasing anything. While the two men, who were real estate agents, were waiting for a third party to arrive for a business meeting, they were approached by police officers who arrested them and escorted them off the premises. The store’s manager, feeling uncomfortable, had called 911 and reported that there were “two gentlemen in the café that are refusing to make a purchase or leave.” The crime? “Trespassing and creating a disturbance.”
In an interview with Good Morning America, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson, recounted that the manager never approached them about her concerns before the police arrived. Jamie Riley, a Starbucks spokesperson, told The Washington Post that the store’s official policy was that non-paying customers must first be asked to leave the store before police intervention would be necessary. 
“In this situation,” Riley said, “the police should never have been called. And we know we have to review the practices and guidelines to help ensure it never happens again.”
Not too long after the incident made headlines, another video surfaced where a black man who was denied access to the Starbucks restroom for not making a purchase, approached a white customer as he was leaving the restroom who, despite not having made a purchase himself, was granted access. 
“What did I do? I just tried to use the bathroom like you did,” he said to the man. “Is it my skin color?” he repeatedly asked. 
Though these stories shocked many, even prompting the hashtag #boycottstarbucks on Twitter, many black Americans, including myself, saw it as another case of racial bias coming to light in 21st century America. Implicit bias in itself is a natural psychological function that allows humans to react faster in making connections. However natural, when connected to divisions between humans such as gender, sexual orientation, or race, it is a clear problem, one whose reaches and its pervasiveness to this day still continues to be shocking. 
Implicit bias towards African-Americans is a historical issue. On the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King’s death, it’s unsettling to see just how much progress this country has yet to make. For example, in 1960, four black students famously sat down at the F. W. Woolworth’s lunch counter. The difference in their case was that there was no hidden bias, they knew exactly what reactions they would have to face. “We don’t serve Negroes here,” they were told. Though they were well-dressed and polite to their waiter, they were still denied service and taunted by customers who called them derogatory names and poured drinks on their heads. Fittingly, images of this incident have resurfaced in response to the Starbucks ordeal that Nelson and Robinson encountered. Though they were well-dressed and by all accounts not disruptive, they were treated uncivilly, a response that would've been undoubtedly different were it not for the color of their skin and the implicit bias attached to it. 
"The Starbucks situation provides dangerous insight regarding the failure of our nation to take implicit bias seriously," said National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) president and CEO Derrick Johnson in a statement. "We refuse to believe that our unconscious bias — the racism we are often unaware of — can and does make its way into our actions and policies."
In response to the incident, Kevin Johnson, the CEO of Starbucks, stated, “I’ve spent the last few days in Philadelphia with my leadership team listening to the community, learning what we did wrong and the steps we need to take to fix it. While this is not limited to Starbucks, we’re committed to being a part of the solution. Closing our stores for racial bias training is just one step in a journey that requires dedication from every level of our company and partnerships in our local communities.”
While I commend Starbucks for taking the initiative to tackle this issue (but let's be real, anything less would've been scrutinized by the media), I find it unsettling that this is a policy that its employees didn't feel like they had to abide by before: treating people with respect. 
Though it has not been disclosed how the training will be conducted, it has been revealed that it will “address implicit bias, promote conscious inclusion, prevent discrimination and ensure everyone inside a Starbucks store feels safe and welcome."
Will it work? Comparing the 1960 sit in to today doesn’t leave me hopeful, bias always seems to be lurking.

Ever since Donald Trump announced he was running for president, he remained skeptical of the status quo of trade. His "America first" vision involved pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and hefty negotiations with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). He pledged to declare China a currency manipulator. Trump claimed that ultimately, he can bring back jobs to America. However, the people who Trump appealed to and promised to help are now becoming fearful for a trade war that will ultimately hurt them.
Earlier this month, Trump threatened to burden Chinese goods with a hefty $100 billion tariff. Consequently, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, on CNBC, recognized the "potential of a trade war," which led to Dow Jones plummeting. The Chinese government responded to the threat of a tariff by saying that it would "fight at any cost." This included a proposed retaliatory tariff on soybeans, corn, and other row crops, biting at the farmers here in the U.S.
Even those who believe that the U.S. is being taken advantage of by unfair trade policies and demand change are wary of the potential trade war. Farmers, especially, are beginning to fear a trade war and what that would mean for them. Already, the threat of a trade war was enough for the price of soybeans to plummet. If tensions were to escalate to a trade war, Americans should anticipate higher price tags on imported goods. Conversely, struggling farms would be slashing prices to try to make ends meet, if they can even stay in business at all.
As bleak as some farmers' futures may be, not all have lost faith in Trump or are completely disenchanted. Some perceive the threat of a tariff to be a gateway for negotiations. A threat would catch attention; striking a deal would come after. Some others do believe that he acted harshly, but regardless of the possible motives, there is a theme that ties all the speculations: hope that Trump would be a man for the working class. After being left unsatisfied during the Obama administration, farmers wanted someone who would bring something different and who would change the status quo. Clinton would deliver no change; Trump, on the other hand, would.
Unfortunately, the change that was anticipated was not the fear of a trade war.
Yes, the U.S. has a trade deficit of approximately $375 billion. However, slapping on tariffs is not the way to go. This resonates with the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act during Herbert Hoover's term. The Great Depression made isolationism appealing, and the act appeared to be a potential solution to pull the U.S. out of the depression and protect U.S. farmers against agricultural imports. However, this tariff led to the over-production of agricultural goods, causing farmers to drop their prices. Farmers cannot indefinitely drop prices; once they pass the break-even point, selling their crops would cause them to lose profit, not gain profit, leading them to go out of business. More than a thousand economists urged Hoover to veto the bill, but the bill was signed and the depression was further exacerbated.
Just as it was in the 1930s, there is not much room for optimism in Trump's threat to burden China with tariffs. If the mere threat of a tariff was enough to trigger a change in prices in soybeans, it is hard to imagine the reach of actual tariffs implemented. Additionally, this would create further tensions with China, something the U.S. cannot afford to do.
There is a significant reason Trump is reluctant to explicitly label China a currency manipulator despite the fact he promised to do so on the campaign trail. In 2017, Trump tweeted, "Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem?" If the U.S. has strained relations with China, Trump would have a harder time pressuring North Korea to de-nuclearize. Given the potential stakes and unpredictable behaviors of North Korea, Trump cannot ruthlessly provoke China for possible personal gain.
Of course, no single person or political figure can singlehandedly start a trade war, and President Trump is no exception. However, trade is essential to the U.S. economy and President Trump does have power and influence. If he truly wants to put "America first," perhaps he should reconsider provoking a major trade partner and instead create policies that would actually benefit the working class and those he promised to help.

Wilson Ekern and Adam Tunnard presented an important front-page piece in last week's issue of The Tartan, covering a visit from Newt Ginrich two weeks ago. Mr. Ginrich’s visit to Carnegie Mellon University brought together important voices in policy and technology and, I’m sure, posed a unique challenge to the staff of The Tartan to provide productive, neutral reporting. Let’s see how the writers did.
There are (at least) three, fundamental components of a story that responsible reporting covers: (1) Facts, (2) Context, (3) Bias. 
(1) Did Ekern and Tunnard provide accurate information about Mr. Ginrich’s visit? Yes. No problems here. 
(2) Did Ekern and Tunnard put Mr. Ginrich’s visit in context? Yes. For example, they mention that Director Skinner, who invited Mr. Ginrich to speak, worked on Mr. Ginrich’s presidential campaign in 2012. 
(3) Did Ekern and Tunnard control for bias? Hell. No. 
But wait! They spend almost the entire second half of their piece pointing out Mr. Ginrich’s bias! What more can you ask for?
What I ask for is that the staff of The Tartan control for reporting bias. Consider how Ekern and Tunnard point out one of Mr. Ginrich’s controversial claims:
“[Mr. Ginrich’s] equating of (sic) fracking technology to the work being done in nanotechnology or AI here at Carnegie Mellon University is a somewhat dubious claim, as fracking has certainly not been as flawless as the portrait he paints.” 
Look closely. That is propaganda. 
Not for liberal, environmental progressivism, and certainly not for Mr. Ginrich’s version of conservativism. It is propaganda for Carnegie Mellon University. Let me leave you with an equivalent translation of the argument that Ekern and Tunnard present:
“Fracking is not like CMU because fracking isn’t perfect.”
When I went to address this letter, I found the following statement: “The Tartan is not an official publication of Carnegie Mellon University.” I challenge you, the writers and editors of The Tartan, to report responsibly.
