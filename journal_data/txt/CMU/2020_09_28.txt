Seven teams changed their uniforms prior to the start of the 2020 season. Some uniforms are great; others, not so much. With the change in uniforms comes a change in the pecking order of uniforms. Here are top 10 NFL jerseys for the 2020 season (home uniform).
10) Minnesota Vikings
Wearing their modern threads since 2013, the Minnesota Vikings uniforms are a clean, crisp and pleasant purple to look at on Sundays. I like how their modern jerseys took the simplicity of their 70s jerseys and fit it for the present day. Vikings’ fans should definitely enjoy watching their team in these uniforms and the SKOL-chanting on Sundays.
9) Green Bay Packers
Keeping the classic green and yellow scheme since 1959, the Green Bay Packers classic uniforms stand the test of time. Built for the loyal fans of this small Wisconsin town’s football team, I like how these green jerseys and yellow pants look good during a sunny September home opener and a freezing NFC Championship game at Lambeau. The Packers have found their perfect uniforms for their iconic team. 
8) New Orleans Saints
Having transitioned to the all black uniforms in 2013, the New Orleans Saints have one of the most aesthetic uniforms in the league. The all-black is perfect for the high-octane offense of the Saints as it flashes across the field with receivers and running backs making dynamic plays constantly. The Superdome should continue to feature these fantastic jerseys on Sunday. 
7) Las Vegas Raiders
Even after moving to the Sin City, the Las Vegas Raiders uniform is still as intimidating as it was back in Oakland. In particular, I like the black with grey numbers as it shines well under the bright lights. While the move to Vegas may be questionable, the uniforms certainly are not. 
6) Indianapolis Colts
While the new uniform change was subtle, the new font on the Colts’ uniforms makes a great uniform even better. Specifically, the new font matches with the simplistic blue and white color scheme.  With these modified uniforms, the Colts’ uniforms are an example of a perfect football uniform. 
5) Pittsburgh Steelers
While not quite as good as the “Steel Curtain” uniforms of the 1970s, the modern Steelers’ uniforms are still sleek. The black and yellow jersey and pants combination is an instant classic for Sundays. Hopefully, this team continues to trot out this beautiful combination for years to come.
4) Los Angeles Chargers
It’s rare for a team to change good uniforms, but the Los Angeles Chargers made the bold switch in the offseason. And it paid off with a modern look that draws on the old uniforms of the 1960s. As the Chargers’ organization ushers in an era of change, the new uniforms are leading the way to make the Chargers a stronger franchise for tomorrow. 
3) San Francisco 49ers
The 49ers’ red and gold combination typifies the Bay Area and the uniform is simple on the eyes like any logo of a Silicon Valley startup. With its crisp uniforms, the 49ers have paved a path to success, winning five titles. While they came up just short last year, hopefully, the 49ers can hoist the Lombardi trophy in these sleek jerseys this year. 
2) Seattle Seahawks 
When Nike partnered with the NFL in 2012, they wanted to inspire a new era of uniforms. Their best work has to be the Seahawks uniforms, which are futuristic and intricate but also visually pleasing on the eyes. With these uniforms, the 12th man has something more to cheer along with the great play on Sunday’s. 
1) Dallas Cowboys
When the Dallas Cowboys decided to switch their home uniforms to white in 1971, they stunned the league with their rebellious move, becoming the first team to do so. Nearly 50 years later, their gamble has paid off as the blue numbers and white jerseys stand out as perfection. Whether they are playing with these jerseys at home in Jerry World or on the road, there is no stadium that can ruin the lore of this iconic jersey.

This is a fictionalized story about COVID-19.
Dracorona, the blood-sucking vampire, awakes from his dusty tomb after a millennium of lifeless slumber. His fangs emerge as he smirks to himself, wipes blood off his chin, and dashes out of the cemetery. A gleam of moonlight strikes Dracorona’s face, and he is instantly energized, itching to discover new snacks inside the human world. While his species has been around for centuries, nobody had met anyone quite like this vampire before. Quite frankly, the world was not prepared.
The vampire infected his first victim while disguised in bat form. After news of his bite spread, some were petrified, but others remained optimistic that Dracorona’s thirst for human blood would soon grow weak. They continued with everyday life, thinking they would be safe as long as the vampire didn’t come to their country, their neighborhoods, their backyards. But soon enough, the world came to fear Dracorona. 
On his world tour, the vampire continued biting unsuspecting civilians, eventually extending his influence overseas. His bites were painful and even deadly for some, while others didn’t even know they were bitten at all. Dracorona’s bites were especially dangerous for senior citizens, who were bitten at higher rates than the rest of the population. Instantly, Dracorona became a parasite the world was unable to get rid of. His bites were discovered to be airborne, traveling distances up to six feet apart. The vampire followed his victims to school, convinced public places to shut down, and even subjected the world to the displeasures of social distancing.
Nevertheless, students are ready to fight the vampire at Carnegie Mellon University, assembling classmates and faculty to repel the virus from the Pittsburgh community. Knowing Dracorona’s weak spots, they arm their campus with masks and hand sanitizer. First-Year business administration major Eyal Davidov said that to prevent the vampire’s bite, “students need to wear a mask,” further explaining,“ social distancing should be maintained whenever possible.”
If the Tartans follow their responsibilities to defeat the vampire, they will eventually return to a life without dreading Dracorona’s bites. Freshman engineering major Eric Grynberg said, “Sometimes I need a hug from my friends, then I realize [Dra]coronavirus exists.” Now, students are being tested to determine whether or not they have been bitten. When describing their experience getting tested, an anonymous first-year Dietrich student explained, “if you are discovered to have a bite, you get sent to isolation housing until the vampire’s trace leaves your body. The system is not perfect, but it works.” 
So please, Tartans, do your part to prevent Dracorona the vampire from biting his way into our semester.

Mild spoiler alert for this review, so go watch this movie first, it’s amazing.
Charlie Kaufman released another nihilistic and abstract movie about life, regret, and characters that are extensions of Kaufman himself, and I am reminded why I always put him on a pedestal. Kaufman has talked about why he thinks movies are dead, and with each new release he’s had, he simultaneously proves and disproves the point, like he’s the Schröedinger of writers and directors.
In his latest effort to make us feel sad about being alive, he’s written a story about a woman trying to end her relationship with her boyfriend, but it’s more than that, because why wouldn’t it be? It’s an existential crisis told through a simple premise, where the progression of the plot isn’t the focus so much as all the little details that make no sense.
The main character of this movie, Jake, is the younger version of the old janitor character that is shown throughout the movie, and the main story we see is in the janitor’s mind as he thinks about ending his own life. Every character in the story voices each thought, struggle, fear, and regret that the janitor has. The woman, played by Jessie Buckley, is an extension of the janitor’s thoughts and how his life could have been instead of what it is now, where he is alone and miserable as an old man. His parents are a manifestation of his fear of death and aging. His younger self is a vehicle to feel like he has agency in his life and that he is able to take action for himself.
The conversations all sound like it’s one person talking to themselves, which becomes increasingly clear as the story goes on. For example, the woman’s backstory changes throughout the movie as the janitor tries out different fun backstories for the fantasy of how his life could have ended up. Or perhaps he is fantasizing about the different ideal women he could have ended up with, so he doesn’t die alone. As the story continues, we see that the janitor’s internal thoughts are starting to become much more clear: he accepts his existential anguish and accepts in his head that he has to end his life.
It’s a story about the fears we all have to different degrees, and despite realizing that a bit over halfway in, I still had a hard time articulating why this movie was so discomforting or what those fears were until after the credits rolled. It’s freeform on the first watch, but by the second and third the whole puzzle comes together; although, that doesn’t mean you have to watch this multiple times to get it or enjoy it.
All of this shouldn’t work honestly. There’s no structure, it follows the gimmick of “oh it’s in this man’s mind,” and it’s abstract to the point of confusion a lot of the time. Yet Kaufman has got me eating out of the palm of his hand. I loved every second of I’m Thinking of Ending Things, but I need to stop obsessing over this. Come on, Kaufman, I still have work in the morning. 
A Few Other Movies
The Devil All The Time - 5/10
The Devil All The Time is cinematic masochism posing as a character study about violent and awful people, with no real sense of purpose for being as bleak as it is. After 138 minutes of repetitive brutality with the only nuances coming from the actors’ performances, the whole experience is exhausting. It’s more irritating when the only thing the story then has to offer is something as simple as “religion is bad, violence has consequences, and the devil is in all of us all the time.” You’re better off watching No Country for Old Men or There Will Be Blood instead.
Artemis Fowl - 1/10
I truly hated this audio-visual product. It disturbs me that despite having great source material in front of them, they took nothing from it. It’s insulting that Disney assumes that the audience is so stupid that they can reduce the cold and calculating anti-hero in the books to an embarrassing, insipid, “friendship-loving” kid who wants to just do random things for no rhyme or reason. There’s so much more to delve into, but it’s pointless being angry about yet another bad product from the Disney corporation. What a waste of resources.
Feels Good Man - 8/10
Most movies about the internet tend to be bad, but this is not one of them. A documentary following the journey of Matt Furie, the artist of Pepe the Frog, and his attempt to reclaim Pepe the Frog from the alt-right ends up becoming more a nuanced discussion about one central question: to what extent do we all individually or collectively own what’s on the internet? This central question drives the entire documentary, and it’s sweet and sad to watch this man slowly come to terms with his art being lost to the vast deluge that is the internet.

Hidden in a little nook right off Forbes Ave. sits JJ Poke Bowl & Taiwanese Bubble Tea. Located at 110 Atwood St., this family-owned eatery is the perfect location for a quick stop to pick up a meal, authentic bubble tea, or even miscellaneous Asian snacks. 
Upon entering the brightly lit store, you are immediately greeted by lively music, colorfully decorated walls, and Covid-19 preventative measures. Although JJ Poke Bowl & Taiwanese Bubble Tea is currently only open for take-out or delivery through a third-party source, the staff have taken precautions to prioritize their customers’ health. 
“We don’t have anyone coming in [to eat],” manager Jackson Chen said. “But we still sanitize in between and then get back to work. So everything is safe, and we require everyone to wear masks when they come in.” 
Although there are COVID-19 induced modifications to the interior design, JJ Poke still maintains its bright and colorful décor. It still has its Post-it covered wall, displaying an abundance of compliments from satisfied customers, animated menus plastered to surfaces, and shelves and fridges filled with classic Asian snacks. 
Just having celebrated its one year anniversary, JJ Poke Bowl & Taiwanese Bubble Tea acknowledges that poke, which is a dish native to Hawaii featuring diced raw fish, is relatively new to the area. 
“It's a little different to Oakland, and Pittsburgh in general, because not many places have what we have,” Chen said. 
Understanding that not everyone eats raw fish, the owners also prepare cooked protein options—including tofu and chicken— as possible toppings to their poke bowls. They also serve flavorful bento boxes with an array of proteins. 
The owners of JJ Poke were inspired to open their own store after years in the restaurant industry and perfecting all of the necessary sushi skills. 
“We are all working for ourselves, and our families,” Chen said. “We didn’t want to work for someone else anymore. We wanted to do our own thing.” 
Although this restaurant has only been open for a short and challenging period of time, they have been dedicated to making, “good food, high-quality healthy food, “ Chen said. 
Here are some highlights from my recent visit to JJ Poke Bowl & Taiwanese Bubble Tea.
Bountiful Bowls:
Build Your Own Bowl ($8.95, $10.95, $12.95): The price of the poke bowl is dependent on the number of scoops of protein, ranging from one to three. The fresh fish is brought in from a Japanese supplier in Ohio. While the fish quality is mediocre, if mixed with the right sauce and toppings, you can build a delicious bowl to your liking. 
If you are new to the poke scene, JJ Poke Bowl & Taiwanese Bubble Tea also has some signature bowls where they have carefully crafted a meal based on trial and error, according to Chen. 
Chicken Bento Box ($10.95): This dish included teriyaki chicken, an array of vegetables,  and some sort of mystery curry. This bowl’s flavors were overpowering each other, with an underlying taste of salt. The chicken was cooked well, but the seasoning was underwhelming and flavoring was subpar. 
If you visit, I would recommend sticking to the poke bar and avoiding the chicken bento box. 
Bodacious Bubble Tea:
Original Taiwanese Bubble Tea ($3.95, $4.95): This drink is very milky and sweet and has all the components of a classic Taiwanese bubble tea. The tea and tapioca are imported from Taiwan, and the tapioca balls themselves had the perfect consistency.

If you’re a Carnegie Mellon student, you might have noticed that the overall cost of attending Carnegie Mellon this semester was ever-so-slightly lower than last semester. This was not due to a reduction in tuition, like what was rolled out at some other universities, but rather because the student activities fee was reduced for this semester following a recommendation from the student government executive committee, composed of Govind Menon, Student Body President; Liam O'Connell, Undergraduate Student Senate Chair; and Josh Gyory, Graduate Student Assembly President. The activities fee was reduced by 25 percent for undergraduate students and 20 percent for graduate students, a move that reduces the overall funding of student government this semester by several hundred thousand dollars.
After spring break of the last academic year, campus shut down entirely. Students began taking their classes remotely, and all events and budget items that student government had planned for the end of the school year were no longer able to be held. Both the GSA and the Undergraduate Senate decided to donate much of this leftover funding to the Tartan Emergency Support Fund and the CMU Pantry. 
This predicated what would later be a dilemma for student government. Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the hybrid model proposed for the Fall semester, many events and other budget items would need to be scrapped. What happens with all the leftover money? 
One possible way to limit excess cash is to reduce the student activities fee at both the graduate and undergraduate level, which funds the two bodies of student government respectively. This type of change would typically start within the GSA or Undergraduate Senate, and would require a vote of a two-thirds supermajority in each body. Only then would a recommendation is made to the Board of Trustees for approval, as laid out in Article III of the Student Government Fiscal Policy. That process did not happen for this year’s reduction in the student activities fee. 
On May 20, Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Gina Casalegno connected with the student government advisors to “initiate discussion with the incoming student government leadership about the 2020-21 Student Activities Fee and the undergraduate Media Fee,” according to a written statement from Casalegno. This contact came around the time when “university leadership was discussing the various fees assessed each academic year to determine whether any should be adjusted in light of the pandemic,” Casalegno stated.
“Given the unprecedented circumstances of the pandemic,” Casalegno said, “I went to student government to ask if they wished to reduce their fees.” She told the student government executive committee that Carnegie Mellon President Farnam Jahanian needed an activities fee recommendation by June 12. 
The student government executive committee took to Casalegno’s idea to reduce the fees, and on June 11, recommended that the university approve a 20 percent reduction in the activities fee for graduate students and a 25 percent reduction for undergraduates. From there, the recommendation was “reviewed by the president, provost, and executive management team and then it was affirmed. Since these amounts were lower than the not to exceed amounts authorized by the board of trustees, there was not a need for any board action,” according to Casalegno. The Board of Trustees approved a ‘not to exceed’ number for fees late in 2019 for the academic year 2020-2021, as is typical. 
As reported by The Tartan, no vote for the proposed lower fee was held in either body of student government. Even though their constitution stipulates a two-thirds supermajority approval vote, Graduate Senate Assembly president Josh Gyory told The Tartan that there was no vote on the reduction. Instead, there was a “large discussion” in the June 3 GSA meeting. 
The notes from that meeting indicate that this discussion was held for around 20 minutes. Some attendees pushed back on the idea to reduce the fee. 
The undergraduate senate, which doesn’t typically meet over the summer, had no general-body discussion of the fee reduction. Liam O’Connell, Undergraduate Student Senate Chair, told The Tartan that their decision came after a discussion among the seven-member executive committee of the Undergraduate Student Senate. 
The lack of a vote, as well as the level of administrative involvement in what is typically a student government-spearheaded process, led Peter Tschofen, a doctoral student in engineering and public policy, to write a Letter to the Editor in The Tartan. Tschofen criticized the decision and process surrounding the fee reduction. 
In the letter, he wrote that while the reduction might have been solidly supported in both governmental bodies, “the action our leaders took, while being pressured to act quickly by Dean Casalegno, were fundamentally undemocratic in nature, because they broke with one of the core tenets of democratic systems, the ‘power of the purse,’ which establishes checks and balances in government.” 
Tschofen used to be a GSA representative, but he is no longer serving in that role. He’s remained interested and involved in the happenings of student government as a constituent. Tschofen told The Tartan in an interview that the reduction of the student activities fee took him by surprise. “I learned about the fee reduction when I saw the fee that I was being charged on my account… then I reached out to the people I knew [in the GSA], and started asking questions,” he said.  
Tschofen sent a series of questions to Gyory and Gary Wilkins, the GSA vice president of finance. When Tschofen asked about why this decision was not taken to a general body vote, Gyory and Wilkins wrote that the proportional allocation of the GSA budget was unchanged—45 percent going to the operating budget, 30 percent to the Joint Funding Committee, and 25 percent to graduate student departments—so no vote was necessitated by Article III, Section B, even though each of these allocations would be affected by the overall reduction of money coming in.  
Gyory and Wilkins also added that “in the case of this one-time reduction of student fees for Fall 2020, the discretion of the university leadership does not require the process of Section III to be followed. Under the conditions of a global pandemic, the preparation of a recommendation by the student government executive committee best reflects the common practice of student government providing input into the fee setting process, even in the case when Section III was not followed.”
Much of the disagreement about the decision to reduce the activities fee hinges on this interpretation of Article III of the Student Government Fiscal Policy, as well as the ultimate power of the Board of Trustees to approve changes. As stated in the university’s activities fee policy, “final responsibility for establishing the amount of any required fee rests with the Board of Trustees, which will consider changes only upon requests of the Student Government and the officers of the university.” 
“Depending on how you interpret that single sentence, you kind of need student government's
agreement,” Tschofen said. However, Gyory and Wilkins write in their response to Tschofen that “the discretion of the university leadership does not require the process of Section III to be followed,” meaning that the officers of the university can potentially bypass the student government’s constitution.
“It's about power in student government, right? It's about who decides how they're funded,” Tschofen said, “there's a reason why we have student government: we're supposed to be an individual stakeholder that has its own voice. We're not supposed to just be the puppets of the admin.” 
Tschofen took issue not just with the process that led to the fee reduction, but also the way it so greatly reduced the student government’s operating budget. “If they can't hold the social events,” Tschofen said, “there's plenty of other things they can spend money on,” including long-term initiatives and existing projects. 
He continued, “I think if I were in student government, I would have tried to get leverage through this discussion, right? Saying, ‘okay, fine, we'll reduce the fee. But maybe, hey, how about tuition reduction? Or how about let's scrap the transportation fee, nobody can take public transit in Pittsburgh, right? None of these things took place. They just caved.”
Gyory sees the situation differently. In an interview with The Tartan, Gyory reaffirmed the sentiment shared by all of the executive committee earlier this month, saying, “we didn't feel pressured by Gina to do anything. The only pressure that we felt was the time, you know, we had to think about it and make a decision in a short timeframe.” 
Gyory said the way Casalegno approached the issue in their communication was open-ended. There was nothing like “you must reduce the activities fee, or you should definitely consider this,” Gyory said of Casalegno’s approach, adding that the rationale she gave for her suggestion referenced the uncertainty looming around the start of the school year. 
“I'm not really concerned about the university interfering with how we handle our funds. I think Student Government is still pretty independent of that” Gyory said. “I think we did the best that we could, taking in a lot of different factors that played into this and the uncertainty of this situation. I think we did a very good job, and I'm proud of what we did.”
On Sept. 21, the Student Government executive committee sent out their second campus-wide email of the school year. In it, they explain their decision to reduce the activities fee, saying, “it was our ambition to act in accordance with feedback we heard from students during the Spring and Summer, and we believe our decision reflects that…. We are confident our recommendation ensures this equity while providing our bodies, student organizations, and departments the flexibility they need to support their constituents for this semester as well.” Their email marked the first public explanation of the activities fee reduction. 
The activities fee might have been reduced for this semester, but it was one of the only fee reductions students saw. Casalegno told The Tartan that university administration “maintained tuition, as previously announced, to ensure the financial stability and health of the university as we continue to deliver our educational and research missions and meet student support needs in the face of this pandemic.”

This week, Sept. 28 through Oct. 2, marks the second annual Weight Stigma Awareness Week (WSAW). The National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) hopes to challenge the assumptions associated with weight and create a more holistic approach to health. 
NEDA defines weight stigma as “discrimination or stereotyping based on a person’s size.” Common examples include discrimination in the workforce, stereotypes about people with different body sizes, and differences in the quality of healthcare based on body size.
Weight stigma has appeared in the medical sphere in another way recently. Headlines have warned that a person may be at higher risk of COVID-19 complications should they have a higher weight. The UK is planning on requiring restaurants with more than 250 employees to disclose calorie counts to help combat obesity-related complications from COVID-19. However, despite these initiatives to lose weight, a recent study published in the JAMA Network failed to determine that weight alone does not affect mortality rates. 
Weight has been a controversial indicator of health even before the current pandemic. Body mass index (BMI) is often used to categorize a person’s weight as underweight, healthy, overweight, or obese. However, BMI is an out of date metric, and was created by Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quetelet, a Belgian social scientist, in the early 19th century. He intended the indicator as a tool to efficiently calculate obesity rates so that the government could better allocate resources, not as a diagnostic tool. Although a correlation between weight and some health outcomes has been observed, such as Type 2 Diabetes, it is an oversimplified index that fails to capture a holistic view of overall health.
Students at Carnegie Mellon shared their personal experiences with weight stigma, both prior to coming to campus and on-campus, to The Tartan.  A senior in Dietrich who wishes to remain anonymous shared that, “people at CMU seem to be less concerned with their own and others’ appearance,” a sentiment echoed by other students who participated in the survey. CIT senior Elizabeth Lister further expands on this observation, saying that fatphobia, or the fear of fatness, is “self-directed [by students] more than anything else.” A university like Carnegie Mellon can attract highly-driven, perfectionist individuals: individuals who are statistically more susceptible to eating disorders.
Students’ medical experiences at Carnegie Mellon vary more. Some students have had neutral experiences in medical settings. However, some students have reported that weight has had a negative impact on their experience seeking medical help, even affecting the likelihood that they would seek medical help in the future. Lister is one example. The mechanical engineering student told The Tartan that she was severely underweight during her adolescence. “You'd think that a 5'7" teenager who weighed less than 100 pounds would set off some alarm bells, but no, my weight was never flagged [in medical check-ups],” she recalled. Being in an area where a large proportion of people whose body mass index (BMI) fell in the obese category, her low weight was ignored or even praised. She summarized the unhealthy association that she learned between weight and health as “if you’re not fat, you’re fine.”
Carnegie Mellon University does offer students guidance on nutrition, though options are limited. University Health Services has one dietitian, Barb Benedict, but students may not be aware of such resources. Incoming freshmen are not introduced to nutrition services during Orientation Week similarly to how they are to Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) or the Office of Title IX. Both UHS and Benedict declined to speak with The Tartan for further information.
Weight is a health topic that captures media attention, especially when individuals with certain health conditions are more at risk of complications. However, drawing a causal relationship between weight and health has been suggested to be reductive. NEDA encourages people to share how weight stigma has impacted them during WSAW. On a federal level, NEDA is also pushing for The Eating Disorders Prevention in Schools Act of 2020 (H.R. 6703), which would shift the focus on health away from weight, and instead, on the importance of physical activity and nutrition. However, health does not have a one-size-fits-all shape, and emerging research is pointing towards a more refined approach to health.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg dedicated her life to social reform and justice. The spark came when she was at Cornell University, working as a research assistant for the famed professor of constitutional law Robert Cushman. As she realized how far we were straying from our most fundamental values, Ginsburg resolved to go into law and stand up for the oppressed, soon helping to launch the Women’s Rights Project at the ACLU in her fight against gender discrimination. Throughout her extensive career and her later appointments to the D.C. Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court, she furthered her well-lauded reputation as a litigator and steadfast advocate for gender equality and human rights, not to mention as a major proponent of moderation and collegiality. On Sept. 17, a day before her passing, she was awarded the 2020 Liberty Medal from the National Constitution Center. She is, to be perfectly blunt, “the closest thing America has to the consummate anti-Donald Trump… the embodiment of hope for an empowered future.”
Of course, she was shown the utmost respect and honor when her casket was laid in National Statuary Hall, making her the first woman and first Jewish person in history to lie in state in the U.S. Capitol. Her legacy of thorough briefs and opinions will also be perused and analyzed indefinitely.
However, the future of this divided, pandemic-ridden nation, short one notorious RBG, is all the more worrying. As the upcoming election nears, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is trying to fill the vacancy on the court as soon as possible. The hypocrisy is obvious. Back in 2016, Republicans blocked President Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland, saying that it was an election year and that voters should be able to weigh in on the next Supreme Court justice. 
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has already shot back at McConnell: “They know there is no reason, no reason, no argument, no logic to justify flipping your position 180 degrees and calling it some kind of principle. It is not.” Schumer continued, “How can we trust each other if when push comes to shove, when the stakes are the highest, the other side will double-cross their own standards when it’s politically advantageous?” Needless to say, with Ginsburg’s dying wish brutally ignored, the infamous partisanship that stains American politics will only grow worse.
Already, the Trump administration has nominated Amy Coney Barrett, currently a judge in the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals, to fill Ginsburg’s newly vacated seat on the Supreme Court. From her 2019 lone dissent after a 7th Circuit panel majority rejected a Second Amendment challenge from a man found guilty of felony mail fraud and prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal and Wisconsin law to her recent dissent after a 7th Circuit panel left intact a U.S. district court decision temporarily blocking a Trump policy that disadvantaged green card applicants who apply for any public assistance, it’s clear her confirmation would establish a 6-3 conservative majority on the court. It follows that with her traditional Catholic beliefs, inseparable from her jurisprudence, this confirmation would probably mark the end of Roe v. Wade. She would also pose a threat to Obamacare, which will be challenged before the Supreme Court on November 10, one week after election day; as an originalist, Barrett has criticized the preservation of the Affordable Care Act as going beyond the plausible meaning of the law.
The outlook looks grim. Of the 53 Republicans in the Senate, only Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who voted against Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, and Senator Susan Collins of Maine, in danger of losing her reelection campaign and citing the Republican policy in 2016, would vote no on any nominee before the election. This 51-49 prediction has McConnell celebrating — since Vice President Mike Pence can issue the tie-breaking vote, McConnell needs only 50 of the 53 Republicans in the Senate on his side.
Thankfully, there exists a strong deterrent for Barrett. As columnist David Frum points out, any last-minute nominee would undoubtedly face a lifetime of suspicion from most of the U.S. after being viciously attacked in the Senate and vilified across the country. Also, the expected battle would mobilize Democrats concerned about the possible rollback of progressive gains and “the potential that a 6–3 conservative majority could hand Trump virtually unchecked power or overturn any major achievement a President Biden could hope to accomplish.” Democrats would decidedly focus on taking control of the presidency and the Senate in hopes of abolishing the filibuster and expanding SCOTUS.
From now until the inauguration of a new president and a new Congress in January, we cannot rest easily. The stakes were already more than high enough with Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the threat to the upcoming election’s integrity, and the ever-so-present political polarization in the U.S. As Howard Zinn wrote, fundamental changes, like implementing universal healthcare or redistributing wealth in the U.S., depend “on the actions of an aroused citizenry, demanding that the promise of the Declaration of Independence — an equal right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness — be fulfilled.”

The death of 87-year-old Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has received international attention for its international implications. The Trump administration is eager to fill the new vacancy, and Democrats are scrambling to halt the process until after the 2020 presidential election. The course of America’s democracy is on the line, throwing the country into a deeper uncertainty.
Ginsburg left an indelible mark on this country’s history. She co-founded the Women’s Rights Project for the ACLU in 1972, and her work and advocacy for gender equality ultimately broadened the 14th Amendment’s equal rights clause to include women. By the time she joined the Supreme Court, she helped wipe out nearly 200 laws that discriminated against women, including “cut[ting] a man’s hair, buy[ing] a drink at the same age [as men], administer[ing] an estate, and serv[ing] on a jury.”
However, nobody is perfect, and RBG is no exception. In the 2005 case City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York, the Supreme Court ruled that the Oneida Indian Nation (OIN) did not have sovereignty over tribal lands that were purchased 200 years prior. Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court and sided with the majority. She claimed that the “long lapse of time, during which the Oneidas did not seek to revive their sovereign control through equitable relief in court, and the attendant dramatic changes in the character of the properties, preclude OIN from gaining the disruptive remedy it now seeks.” She had the opportunity to defend indigenous peoples’ rights in the U.S., but she deemed the reconciliation to be too inconvenient for what it was worth.
More recently, she caught headlines when she commented on the protests of football player Colin Kaepernick. She infamously criticized  the San Francisco 49ers players’ kneeling as “dumb” and “disrespectful,” even considering the protests comparable to burning the American flag. Although she did not consider it an arrestable offense, she considered kneeling during the National Anthem  a “terrible thing to do.” Ginsburg later apologized, saying that she would “be more circumspect,” but it’s unknown what drove her to the public apology.
Even with a less intersectional approach to feminism, Ginsburg’s record doesn’t get off scot-free. She disapproved of now-Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation process and its highly politicized nature. The self-proclaimed “flaming feminist” was disheartened that “patriots on both sides of the aisle” had become so divisive over Kavanaugh. She compared Kavanaugh’s process in 2018 with hers in 1993. The vote on her nomination was 96-3; a stark contrast to Kavanaugh’s 50-48. She called the trial a “highly partisan show,” lamenting more on the political tension itself than the reason for the political tension. She continued support for Kavanaugh after he was sworn in, calling him “very decent and very smart.”
Ginsburg’s decision to not retire in 2014 is a point of controversy. Although she is applauded for her decades-long service to America, she has also been criticized for not retiring during the Obama administration.Had Ginsburg and the other old liberal judges on the bench, like Stephen Breyer or Anthony Kennedy, retired during Obama’s presidency, the Democratic Party could have locked up the most powerful governmental body for decades. An article in the New York Times alleges that Obama did (indirectly) ask Ginsburg to resign in 2013, long after her pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Ginsburg reportedly turned him down, believing that it was entirely her decision to retire, and leaving the chance to fill her seat to whoever won the presidency next.. 
This discussion brings a larger issue into light: the fragility of our democracy. Our country loves to boast about a balance of power and a steadfast democracy, but the death of one major figure has potentially jeopardized decades of progress in social justice. Rulings such as Roe v. Wade could be overturned, and the Supreme Court remains highly partisan.
When we think of one’s legacy, it should be a holistic overview of their highlights and flaws. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was undeniably a trailblazer for feminism and LGBT+ rights. But her being an idol to some should not override the fact she also made decisions that were detrimental to others. Ultimately, remembering Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s legacy should mean remembering her as she was: a complicated, flawed, and influential individual.
