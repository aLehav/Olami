The Carnegie Mellon football team took on the Grove City College Wolverines on Saturday, Sept. 29 at Gesling Stadium. After a close battle for much of the game, the Wolverines pulled away late to take the victory, 31–21. The Tartans move to a 2–2 overall season record and a 1–2 record in the Presidents’ Athletic Conference (PAC).
The Tartans won the toss and deferred, so the Wolverines began with the ball. They opened on their own 35-yard line and leisurely made their way down the field. The Wolverines ran the ball for the first 13 plays, all the way to the Carnegie Mellon nine-yard line. After a defensive pass interference penalty by the Tartans on the Wolverines’ first and only pass play of the drive, the Wolverines ran the ball in for a touchdown. They ate up a total eight minutes off the clock and put the first points of the game on the board.
Trailing 7–0, the Tartans crossed midfield into Grove City territory in the following drive but were unable to convert on third down. The Wolverines continued to run their rush-heavy offensive strategy with success, holding the ball for the rest of the first quarter (and 12:52 of the 15 total minutes). On the first play of the second quarter, the Wolverines’ offense switched it up and threw from the Carnegie Mellon 45-yard line. The gamble paid off with another touchdown.
On the ensuing drive, the Tartans failed to respond. They controlled possession for over three minutes, but the drive was marred by a personal foul penalty in their own territory. The Tartans were unable to cross midfield before punting away. However, the Tartans’ defense responded, forcing the Wolverines to punt in the first three-and-out of the game, giving the ball back to the Tartans’ offense. With the ball back in Tartan hands, senior quarterback Alex Cline engineered an effective 2:34 drive, punctuated by a 38-yard touchdown pass to junior wide receiver Jamie Greenwell to cut the deficit to 14–7 with 7:31 left in the first half.
The Wolverines stuck with their rushing attack, but the Tartans’ defense adjusted to their run and shut it down. The Tartans gained possession with 3:21 remaining in the half. Sophomore running back Luke Bikulege completed an 8-play, 45-yard drive with a short, 1-yard run to tie the game with 24 seconds left before the half.
Coming out of halftime, the score was tied at 14–14. After the first three drives of the second half ended in punts, the Wolverines took the lead 21–14 late in the third quarter. The Tartans tied again at the start of the fourth quarter with a 1-yard run from Junior running back Chris Haas.
On the ensuing drive, the Wolverines pulled ahead again with a 46-yard field goal; then, the Wolverines forced a Tartan three-and-out to get the ball back. The offense matched the effort: a 22-yard rush to put the Wolverines up in Carnegie Mellon territory. This quickly led to a touchdown with 4:20 left in the game to put the Wolverines up by 10 at a score of 31–21. The Tartans tried to string together a few possessions to pull off the come-from-behind win, but their two final drives both ended in interceptions by the Wolverines’ secondary. The first came on the first play of the drive; the second, in the red zone on third down. The pass bounced off its intended receiver into the hands of a Wolverine defender and sealed the win for the Wolverines.
On offense, the Wolverines totaled 420 yards compared to the Tartans’ 345; 308 of the Wolverines’ yards came from the ground attack. On top of that, the Wolverines held possession for 36:53, while the Tartans had the ball for 23:07. Cline’s two interceptions given up late in the game also made a difference, as the Wolverines finished the game turnover-free. Cline finished 21-for-35 with 228 yards and a touchdown. Haas led the team’s running game with 55 yards on 29 attempts, while junior running back Willie Richter was the team’s top receiver with 98 yards through the air. Greenwell had 78 receiving yards, a career high.
Next week, the Tartans go back on the road on Oct. 6 to take on the Waynesburg University Yellow Jackets. Kickoff is set for 1:30 p.m.

It was  a Monday afternoon.
A normal Monday, by all accounts. Nothing seemed amiss. The birds were chirping, the sun was shining, the people were out enjoying life.
Then the ground began to shake, and the sky to the east began to turn a horrifying, sickening shade of orange.
But even as the ground split in the middle of Philadelphia, and the orange monstrosity known as Gritty crawled out of this new fault line, Pittsburgh was, for a few moments, blissfully unaware of the summoning.
But Gritty was here now. Gritty was there before time, and Gritty will be here after. Gritty was not discovered this week — no, Gritty chose to make itself known.
Gritty’s googly eyes move because, like the basilisk of legend, sustained eye contact will paralyze any subject. After cycling through their entire goalie roster in the first three weeks of the season, this may become an asset for the Flyers.
Gritty is both a blessing and a curse. It is part cheese whiz, part rejected Muppet, part Jake Voracek’s discarded beard clippings, and is sustained by the way the city of Philadelphia will never forget that time Sidney Crosby broke both of Claude Giroux’s wrists, guys. In fact, Gritty is Claude Giroux’s fursona.
Gritty is like a phoenix — every time a citizen of the great city of Philadelphia falls asleep covered in Cheeto dust, Gritty, rejuvenated, crawls out of that discarded bag. 
Gritty is not bound by the human concept of city limits. Gritty will come to Pittsburgh, and there is nothing you nor I can do to stop it.
Gritty’s eyes cannot close because it cannot be allowed to forget the face of every man on the Penguins roster.
Gritty can never stop hunting. Nothing can satisfy Gritty, and we all must live in fear until it is returned to whence it came.
Paint your door frames yellow. Hang jerseys in the windows and replace all your family photos with pictures of Phil Kessel. Sit in the dark in silence until you hear it pass.
Gritty is hungry — so hungry. So hungry, and so orange.

The past few years have seen Tiger Woods in awful pain, giving terrible performances on the course. I’m sure we are all aware of the Woods’s disappearance since the early part of this decade, and the effect it has had on the game of golf as a whole. There’s a Saturday Night Live skit from 2009, where Jason Sudeikis plays a lost PGA commissioner trying to find a solution to their Tiger Woods problem: golf doesn’t know what to do without him. Golf has been lost without Woods. Television ratings went down after he started doing poorly, and eventually, tournament attendances went down because of there was no draw for casual fans of the game seeking a character to deify.
This summer, however, has seen Woods claw his way back into the hearts of golf lovers everywhere.
During the Open Championship, golf fans and casual viewed alike saw Woods climb his way towards the top of the leaderboard, accompanied by thunderous applause and the best ratings the Open has seen since 2000. Last weekend, the PGA Tour Championship had a 206 percent growth in ratings from the year before. Tiger Woods is finally back, with a two-stroke victory at eleven shots under par last weekend at the Tour Championship. He controlled the leaderboard throughout the weekend, so despite shooting one over par on Sunday, Woods was still able to win by two strokes. Now that he has returned and is crushing the game, golf fans have a lot to look forward to.
Despite this weekend’s Ryder cup, it’s probable that Woods, in spite of his charisma, talent, and character, won’t reach the full capacity of his game like he did in his prime. He is 42 years old, and a few back surgeries, a dozen years, a car accident, and a divorce will take something out of one’s athletic ability. We may see flashes of the brilliance we once saw on the course, but Woods is aging, along with his game. It’s possible he might even put a few shots short of the green in coming tournaments because of his aging body.
As for the future of golf in the next spring and summer, we may see another consistent contender at the top of leaderboards; Dustin Johnson, Justin Rose, Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, and once again, Tiger Woods are going to be names we see every weekend. Usually by the time one of the all-time great golfers is ending his career, a new one springs up to control the game. Woods’s career was seemingly cut short by injury, so we thought it might have been McIlroy. We might have thought it was Spieth.
But Woods isn’t done yet. We have a couple more years to watch one of the greatest to ever play the game, and we have a couple more years before a new kid sprouts to take over his old position. One of my final hopes for Woods’s career is that he can take his game seriously this winter and don a green jacket one last time come April. Maybe it will have to wait another year or two, but Woods, just for what he means to the game of golf and the gold community, deserves to win another Masters.

Punctuated by a surprisingly strong training camp for Juuso Riikola, the Pittsburgh Penguins are looking better than ever, ready to chase after their third Stanley Cup in just four years.
To the Penguins, being knocked out of the playoffs in the second round by a familiar foe in the Washington Capitals is a disappointing season. To say that the Pens struggled through the 2017-18 season may be a bit of an overstatement, but there were many games when the team looked outmatched and outmanned. Number one defenseman Kris Letang flipped between looking like the elite D-man Penguins fans have come to expect and looking lost on the ice shift-to-shift, while the forward depth at center left quite a bit to be desired. However, getting bumped out of the playoffs early may have been the best thing to happen to the boys in black and gold, as they’ve come back from their long summer hungry and ready to re-establish themselves as the premier team in the NHL.
In this year’s preseason, we saw some wonderful performances by all of the veterans, with winger Phil Kessel scoring a pair of laser wrist shot goals against the Buffalo Sabres, Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin being the players everyone expects them to be and the resurgence of Letang after a full offseason of intensive conditioning. Letang potted two this preseason and has looked like the Tanger we know and love.
In terms of line combinations, Jake Guentzel seems to be a lock, at least initially, to stick with Crosby on the left wing, while Crosby’s right winger will likely be Patric Hornqvist — but look for rookie sniper Daniel Sprong to get some limited action on the top line to see if he can prove himself. Carl Hagelin will likely sit on the left wing with Malkin’s line, where he played most of last season. The rumors of Kessel potentially being traded were obviously false, and he and Malkin look to keep their magic working together.
The bottom six also seems like it has figured itself out. The third line is looking like Dominik Simon, Derrick Brassard, and Bryan Rust. Those three have looked electric in their preseason performances together. Brassard and Rust, in particular, look especially ready to return to the action. Brassard seems both healthy and to have found some real chemistry with his two wingers, and Rust looks like he’s been shot out of a cannon on every shift. That kid doesn’t slow down. The fourth line has also been gelling well, with Riley Sheahan centering veteran Matt Cullen on the left and somebody on the right. It could be Sprong, who is trying desperately to prove that he’s the real deal, or it could be returning youngster Zach Aston-Reese, who struggled in the preseason a bit, but after taking a jaw-breaking hit from the Capitals’ Tom Wilson in the playoffs, it’s to be expected that he isn’t in tip-top shape just yet.
What the Penguins lacked in center depth last season, they have more than made up for.

As someone from Manhattan, Kansas, a town where college football is everything (Go Cats!), I should probably be a bit more ashamed that I’ve only ever seen one football game. Professional football is a whole new can of worms, and my can opener is dull and rusty. I don’t understand the game. I don’t know the players. I don’t even know how many points you get if you score a touchdown or what it means to be a running back.
So, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that this is my first time playing fantasy football. This is also my first time losing a game, and I’ve got to say, it hurt more than I thought it would. This third week saw some interesting changes as some teams dove to the cellar while others arose from the grave. Here’s a recap:
Last Manning Standing over futbol 109.94 to 69.70
Publisher Caleb Miller’s team Last Manning Standing scored the most points in the league for the second week in a row to defeat my team, futbol, by over 40 points — tragic. My team moves to a (now tarnished) record of 2–1 while Miller’s moves to a 2–1 record as well.
Like last week, Last Manning Standing had solid performances all around: San Francisco 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo scored 22.34 points with 251 passing yards, 23 rushing yards, and two touchdowns. New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara scored 19.00 points with 124 receiving yards and 66 rushing yards, and Cincinnati Bengals running back Giovani Bernard scored 14.60 points with 61 rushing yards, 25 receiving yards, and one touchdown. Even Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, and Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Adam Thielen added 11.60, 11.40, and 10.50 points, respectively.
My team futbol was, quite frankly, humiliated. Though Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton made up for lower total yardage by scoring four touchdowns and contributing a solid 29.60 points, it was not enough to make up for the two starters (Panthers tight end Greg Olsen and Cincinnati Bengals running back Joe Mixon) who both scored zero points.
Slugs over Pillbox 97.10 to 75.06
Even though all the players on Pillbox Editor Izzy Sio’s team Pillbox contributed to this week’s final score, Pillbox remains winless and drops to eighth place as Operations Manager Adam Tunnard’s team Slugs moves to a 2–1 record and claims fourth.
Tunnard’s team Slugs earned 19.90 points from Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers (who finished the game with 265 passing yards, 13 rushing yards, and two touchdowns) and 19.70 points from Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans (who finished with 137 receiving yards and one touchdown).
Sio’s team racked up 25.26 points from Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, 19.60 points from Los Angeles Rams running back Todd Gurley, and 18.40 points from Seattle Seahawks running back Chris Carson. Unfortunately, Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen and Vikings wide receiver Stefon Diggs were only able to capture seven catches out of a total 17 combined targets and, ultimately, let the team down.
Gin and Bear It over newz 103.14 to 88.58
Sports Editor Marika Yang’s team Gin and Bear It moves to a 1-2 record while News Editor Nora Mattson’s team newz faces its first loss and moves to a 2-1 record.
Yang’s team beat its projected 87.27 points by almost 16 points to secure its first win of the season. The team saw some solid performances from Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick (who scored 25.14 points with 411 passing yards, 27 rushing yards, and three touchdowns), Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch (who scored 14.60 points with 54 rushing yards and a touchdown), and Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker (who scored 13.00 points).
Mattson’s team was carried by two players: New York Giants running back Saquon Barkley (who scored 17.70 points with 82 rushing yards, 35 receiving yards, and one touchdown) and Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford (who scored 17.48 points with 262 yards passing yards, 10 rushing yards, and two touchdowns). Regrettably, Atlanta Falcons running back Tevin Coleman and Tennessee Titans running back Dion Lewis dropped the (figurative) ball and only logged 87 yards on 29 touches between them.
TARTAN FANTASY over mmichelle123 94.70 to 85.54
Photo Editor Lisa Qian’s team TARTAN FANTASY beat Pillbox Editor Michelle Madlansacay’s team mmichelle123 by less than 10 points. TARTAN FANTASY settles into fifth place with a 2-1 record while mmichelle123 drops to sixth place with a 1-2 record.
Like Miller’s team Last Manning Standing, Qian’s team TARTAN FANTASY brought in points from multiple solid performances. Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson scored 25.00 points (with 385 passing yards, 36 rushing yards, and two touchdowns), Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey scored 19.40 points (with 184 rushing yards and 10 receiving yards), and Chicago Bears running back Jordan Howard scored 14.10 points (with 61 rushing yards, 20 receiving yards, and one touchdown).
Madlansacay’s team  mmichelle123    has          averaged more per game in losses (92.40 points) than in wins (92.02 points). Ravens running back Alex Collins, New Orleans Saints placekicker Will Lutz, and Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown scored 13.40, 13.00, and 11.20 points, respectively. The quarterback, Kirk Cousins of the Vikings, only contributed 10.04 — a significant drop from the 33.50 points he scored last week.
In Week 4, TARTAN FANTASY goes up against futbol, mmichelle123 competes with Last Manning Standing, Gin and Bear It faces Pillbox, and in the most exciting matchup, Slugs plays newz.
My team futbol still holds the record for average points scored per week (100.35), so I’m hoping for a good week to bounce back. Pick up your copy of The Tartan (or check us out online at thetartan.org) next Monday to see how Week 4 of the Tartan Fantasy League goes down!

When was the last time you saw the Milky Way? Many decades ago, the vast trail of stars, planets, and nebulae making up our galaxy could be seen from almost anywhere, even urban centers. But nowadays, this view of the night sky is increasingly uncommon: for 80 percent of Americans, the Milky Way is almost totally obscured. 
Light pollution, the cumulative glow emitted by street lamps, house lights, and commercial installations, has made the sky almost opaque. Over the past 20 years, researchers, state agencies, and non-profit organizations have been working to combat this problem in a number of ways, from mapping the glow emitted by man-made light across the globe, to crafting policy initiatives that would change the streetlamp grid of whole cities. Now, thanks to a grant from the Metro21 Smart Cities Institute at Carnegie Mellon, a new team of researchers is bringing the issue of light pollution home to Pittsburgh.
Led by Diane Turnshek, a professor of experimental physics at CMU, and Stephen Quick, a professor in the School of Architecture, a team of about 15 researchers, students, and night sky enthusiasts are hoping to create a comprehensive map of Pittsburgh’s light emissions using drones. Pilots would use a combination of quadcopters (drones with 4 propellers)  and fixed wing drones (similar to tiny planes) to capture data-rich images of the night sky all over Pittsburgh. These images would contain data not just on how much light is being emitted, but where that light is coming from and what exactly is producing it. 
In recent years, researchers have hoped to highlight the negative effects of light pollution, not just on our view of the night sky, but on the entire ecosystem. But studying these effects on a more intimate level is difficult without a detailed map. Turnshek hopes that the information provided by this project will assist scientists in figuring out the more granular effects of light pollution, and eventually even turn Pittsburgh into a hub for exactly that kind of research.
“We have no idea how we’re changing things in the nighttime ecosystem,” she says. “We’ve increased light in the night sky by 100 times over the last 100 years. Can you imagine if we increased daylight by 100 times?”
Many cities around the world have begun the process of lowering their light emissions. Local governments, from Los Angeles to Pittsburgh, have replaced a huge percentage of their incandescent street lamps with LEDs. These lights have the advantage of both emission reduction and energy efficiency, but they’re not an end-all be-all. In Pittsburgh, early efforts to replace incandescent street lamps used blue LEDs, which can actually cause more glare than the lights they replace. Blue light scatters more widely than lights with redder hues, and while the blue LEDs appeared bright white to the naked eye, this subtle difference in wavelength meant that the light they produced had more severe effects on for the environment and drivers. Other cities have experimented with lamps that only emit light downward, but without attention paid to light color, the same problem can occur, while the shape of these lamps can often reflect light off the sidewalk and straight into the sky.
Last week, the mayor’s office in Pittsburgh released a proposal to set aside $13 million for the replacement of the city’s street lamps with new amber-colored LEDs, which scatter significantly less light than their blue counterparts. Turnshek is optimistic about this proposal.
Turnshek hopes that if Pittsburgh becomes one of the few cities in America to tackle light pollution head on, her team’s research will provide before and after pictures of the night sky to allow scientists and activists in other places around the world to further their understanding and advocacy. Unlike other projects that have captured images of light emissions from high altitudes (including outer space), drones can capture both the light from the city below and a view of the night sky above. This means that if the city replaces its street lamps, Turnshek’s cameras will be able to see the effects of this change from the most comprehensive vantage point possible.
While it’s hard to imagine the impact of changing an entire city’s emissions output, the effects on the night sky would become visible literally overnight. Unlike other kinds of pollution, light emissions don’t stick around. Right now, someone in Pittsburgh who wants to see the Milky Way would have to drive for two hours away from the city. If the lamps are replaced, this time could shrink to as little as 20 minutes.
The effects of a massive reduction in light pollution are far-reaching, and poorly understood. Light emissions disrupt the lives of animal populations, from nocturnal mammals disoriented by artificial brightness, to amphibians whose mating rituals rely on the cover of night. Nighttime brightness can affect humans too, disturbing our natural sleep cycles and physically changing how our eyes adjust to actual darkness. Glare from street and commercial lighting can have effects as obvious as distracting motorists and degrading eyesight, or as subtle as changing the rate of melatonin our bodies produce in the course of a day. 
More than that, Turnshek worries that separating ourselves from the universe around us can have psychological repercussions we haven’t even considered.
“There are 6000 stars in the sky we could be seeing every night,” she says, “and we see about a dozen. We have no idea what that does to us.”
Turnshek believes it’s important to know that our planet is one of many, a relatively small part of an enormous galaxy, itself a tiny fraction of the universe we collectively inhabit. There’s a provincial attitude that comes from limiting your field of vision to the dense but isolated world of modern cities, and she worries that, without a connection to the night sky, we risk severing ourselves from something integral to the way humans have understood reality for millenia. 
This research project is just a stepping stone, and Turnshek hopes that in the future, more people will be drawn to the issue of light pollution, and to preserving the beauty of the night sky. She also wants this project to get new people, especially students, involved in the astronomical community in Pittsburgh. 
“I need help from students,” she says. “If you can do software imaging, if you have an interest in topology, or astronomy, or if this issue is important to you, we would love to have you on board.”
Turnshek and her team will be having a meeting, open to the public, in the Cohon Center Connan room on Monday, Oct. 22 at 6:30 p.m. No experience or prior knowledge is required to attend or participate. Researchers and advocates at the meeting will discuss different aspects of the work they do to combat light pollution, including astrophotography, political activism, and even children’s book publishing.
Turnshek hopes that Pittsburgh can serve as a model for how collaboration between people as varied as artists and physicists can create real and lasting change. “We’re the only city who’s ever done something like this,” she says. “Whatever skills you have, we’ll find a use for it.”

Imagine you’re at a Royal Society library in the UK, browsing through the online catalog for some light reading. You’re looking at old manuscripts and documents, when suddenly, you come across an age-old letter marked-up with various amendments and cuts. It looks like any other letter from the 1600s, complete with spots of dark, aged parchment and nearly illegible script; but upon closer inspection, you realize that it’s a copy of Galileo’s infamous letter to the Catholic Church – edited by none other than Galileo Galilei himself.
Postdoctoral science historian Salvatore Ricciardo found himself in this situation in early August as he researched documents related to Benedetto Castelli, a friend of Galileo. While searching for any copies of Galileo’s letters with handwritten marks, Ricciardo hit the jackpot with this new discovery.
As an observational astronomer in a time period where the Roman Catholic Church had immense power, Galileo faced constant pushback for his ideas. His discovery of the phases of Venus and the four largest moons of Jupiter led him to believe that Copernicus’s heliocentrism theory was correct – that the earth and the planets revolve around the sun. These discoveries were met with opposition from the Catholic church, whose official position at the time was that the sun revolved around the Earth. The church wasn’t going to re-interpret well-established Biblical verses based off of a loosely-knit theory that was actually rejected by most astronomers at the time.
Because Castelli was such a close friend, Galileo felt safe expressing his opinions surrounding the Church – and express his opinions he did. In his letter, Galileo argued against church doctrine that “the scant references in the Bible to astronomical events should not be taken so literally.” Copies of the letter were circulated, causing huge controversy, until eventually Dominican friar Niccolò Lorini forwarded it to the Inquisition in Rome. The Inquisition, whose job was to conduct trials for crimes of religious natures, warned Galileo to abandon the heliocentric theory before they were forced to bring him to trial. Ignoring this warning, Galileo published Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, where he argued for the heliocentric theory and against the Church’s earth-centered theory. Because of this, Galileo was summoned to stand trial and was convicted of “vehement suspicion of heresy.”
All this controversy stemming from one source – his letter to Castelli; and up until Ricciardo’s discovery, the letter continued to be a source of frustration. This is because there are two known surviving versions of this letter: the Castelli letter, and a much milder version sent to friend and cleric Pietro Dini. In the Dini letter, Galileo had suggested that the “version of the letter Lorini had given to the Inquisition may have been doctored,” made to be worse than it actually was. He had forwarded a milder version of the Castelli letter to Dini, insisting that it was the correct version, and asked him to send it to the Vatican. The question of whether or not the inflammatory Castelli letter was the original has stumped historians for years.
But here is where Ricciardo’s discovery comes into play: the letter he had found was a copy of the Castelli letter, amended to be less inflammatory. Galileo himself had doctored his words, trying to mitigate the fallout from the Church and do some damage control. As Ricciardo points out, the differences in the original wording are significant: “In one case, Galileo referred to certain propositions in the Bible as 'false if one goes by the literal meaning of the words.' He crossed through the word ‘false,’ and replaced it with ‘look different from the truth.'” This is proof that the Castelli letter was actually the original, and shows historians that Galileo actively attempted to moderate his language to avoid harsher backlash. “I can’t believe that I have discovered the letter that virtually all Galileo scholars thought to be hopelessly lost. It seemed even more incredible because the letter was not in an obscure library, but in the Royal Society library,” says Ricciardo.
The circumstances surrounding the discovery add another element of strangeness: the letter had gone unnoticed for centuries, being in the possession of the library since at least the mid-18th century. It was repeatedly misdated and miscatalogued – it’s most likely because of this mismanagement that no one had ever connected the letter to the timeline of the Galileo affair. Researchers are now trying to track how long it was at the Royal Society Library, and to piece together how it arrived there in the first place.
While ultimately unsuccessful, Galileo had attempted to trick the Catholic Church with a carefully edited version of his incendiary Castelli letter. “Galileo’s letter to Castelli is one of the first secular manifestos about the freedom of science – it’s the first time in my life I have been involved in such a thrilling discovery” says Ricciardo’s supervisor, Franco Giudice. And now, with this discovery, historians can finally settle a years-long debate.

On Thursday Sept. 27, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) slammed Tesla CEO Elon Musk with a lawsuit for making “false and misleading” statements to the company’s investors. The suit is based on a controversial tweet from Musk on Aug. 7 about taking the company private at $420 per share, which he ended with “funding secured.”
Days later, Musk shared details about his plan in a blog post on Tesla’s website, claiming that the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund had approached him repeatedly about taking the company private and that there was “no question that a deal with [the Saudis] could be closed.” While others on Wall Street were puzzled by a potential move that could cost $72 billion, Musk said he was being advised by investment firm Silver Lake and notable investment bank Goldman Sachs.
According to the SEC, however, the funding was never secured. In the lawsuit, the agency alleges that “Musk had not even discussed, much less confirmed, key deal terms, including price, with any potential funding source.” During a news conference, SEC co-director of enforcement Steven Peikin accused Musk of arriving “at the price of $420 by assuming a 20 percent premium of what Tesla's then existing share price (was), and then rounding up to $420 because of the significance of that number in marijuana culture, and his belief that his girlfriend would be amused by it.”
The allegations against Musk are extremely serious. The lawsuit invokes Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, the same rule used by the SEC in complaints against insider trading and market manipulation. Most importantly, the agency is demanding an undisclosed amount in monetary fines from Tesla and is asking a federal judge to prevent Musk from serving as an officer or director of a public company in the future.
John Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School, thinks Musk could end up with a lifetime ban. “This is a nuclear threat to force him to settle,” he told CNN. “The penalty really falls on Tesla shareholders.”
Indeed, Tesla stocks dropped more than 11 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday, and were trading at $269 per share early on Friday. The price target was $305 before the SEC announced their lawsuit.
The reaction from Wall Street has been swift. Financial services company RBC Capital Markets said the accusations against Musk add “further uncertainty to the Tesla story.” “In our view, this adds more drama to an already volatile stock,” RBC analyst Joseph Spak wrote to Business Insider. Similarly, JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman said, “Beyond this ‘key man risk’ concern (which we believe is of vital importance) we also see a number of other risks, including the potential for decreased confidence in the company on the part of investors, consumers, and suppliers.”
Despite the criticism, Tesla’s board of directors remains positive with Musk, declaring that they “are fully confident in Elon, his integrity, and his leadership of the company.” In a separate statement, Musk called the SEC lawsuit “unjustified,” adding that he felt “deeply saddened and disappointed.” He continued, “I have always taken action in the best interests of truth, transparency and investors. Integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way.”
However, two days later, Musk relented, agreeing to step down as Tesla's board chairman within 45 days. Although he will remain CEO, Musk will be barred from seeking reelection for three years and must pay a $20 million fine to the SEC. The company will pay an additional $20 million for failing to control Musk's voice online.
In a press release, the SEC said that "the $40 million in penalties will be distributed to harmed investors under a court-approved process." While Musk and Tesla declined to comment, the settlement will allow the company to temporarily escape government scrutiny as they focus on improving their production capacity for the upcoming Model 3 rollout.

Halfway between California and Hawaii, ocean currents come together to create a gyre. This vortex of waves concentrates floating debris to form what is known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a collection of water-borne trash big enough to be an independent country. 
Can anyone get rid of it?
The garbage patch, first described in a paper by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 1988, is estimated to cover anywhere from 700,000 square kilometers (about the size of Texas) to 15 million (roughly equivalent to Russia).  
One reason it is so difficult to nail down the extent of the Garbage Patch is because it depends on the cutoff: when is the concentration of plastics high enough to count as being part of the patch? Scientists estimate concentrations of 10 kilograms per square kilometer in its outer regions, and up to 100 kilograms per square kilometers in the center. In total, that comes out to be about 80,000 metric tons of plastic, and 1.8 trillion pieces. 
But this plastic doesn’t remain in the same state in which it was dumped. Plastic will break down with sunlight, a process called "photodegradation." The pieces become smaller and smaller, but remain polymers. In some areas, the concentration of plastics is seven times greater than that of zooplankton. This adds another layer of difficulty in defining the extent of the Patch: the plastic concentrations have to be determined through manual sampling. After sufficient photodegradation, the plastic is too small to be seen; most of the small pieces of plastic exist just under the surface, so satellite images cannot capture the necessary information. Eventually, the plastic pieces become small enough to be ingested by aquatic animals. As smaller animals are eaten by bigger ones, these microplastics become concentrated in the food chain.
The World Economic Forum estimates that the ocean will contain more plastics than fish by 2050. "The primary source of marine debris is the improper waste disposal or management of trash and manufacturing products” says a 2011 EPA report, “including plastics (e.g., littering, illegal dumping) ... Debris is generated on land at marinas, ports, rivers, harbors, docks, and storm drains. Debris is generated at sea from fishing vessels, stationary platforms, and cargo ships."
Enter The Ocean Cleanup, a company founded by Dutch inventor Boyan Slat when he was only 18. They sent out a beta test of their floating garbage collector technology on Sept 8th. The 600m (apx. 2000ft) System 001 nicknamed “Wilson,” five years in the making, cost about $24.6 million (including design, development, production, assembly, and monitoring during the first year). It has solar-powered lights and anti-collision systems, and it actively transmits its position at all times. Wilson will gather 5 tons of trash per month and will carry instruments to monitor wear and tear, and collect climate and wave data from Great Pacific Garbage Patch, more than 1000 nautical miles away from its launch point in California. 
Wilson’s job is to take advantage of wind, wave, and current to corral dispersed plastic and allow for more efficient collection. Most of the plastic mass is in larger pieces of debris, which are easier to collect than the microplastics they will eventually become. 
The device has two main parts. The first is buoyant, and it sits on the surface of the water. Below, an apx. 3m (10ft) skirt is attached. Because the ocean currents move the system and plastic alike, it automatically drifts to areas of highest plastic concentrations. Unlike the current, the waves only move the floater, which is partly above the surface, while the plastic that is usually just beneath the surface is unaffected. The skirt is longer in the middle, which creates more area for the current to apply force. This differential pressure causes the flexible system to assume a u-shape. The floating part keeps the system buoyant and keeps debris from washing over the system, while the skirt catches what flows underneath. Every 4-6 weeks, a boat comes out to gather concentrated plastic and transport it back to land. 
Proceeds from recycling and creating products from the collected plastic will help fund operations in the future. The Ocean Cleanup’s eventual goal is to take the lessons they learn from Wilson’s beta test and deploy a fleet of 60 improved units in a year and a half. Additional funding will come from corporations, which will be able to sponsor cleanup systems in the future. Sponsors will be able to use an app to follow the unit’s course and monitor how much plastic is collected.
The Ocean Cleanup set an ambitious target of cleaning up 50 percent of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in five years, and 90 percent by 2040. Of course, this is treating the symptoms, but not the disease. The existing ocean garbage does need to be cleaned up, but we should also find ways to prevent it from getting there in the first place.

Maroon 5's concert at PPG Arena, on Saturday, Sept. 28, was the very first concert I'd ever been to. To say I was excited was an understatement. After spending $40 on a t-shirt we could have made for $10, my friend and I entered the arena with huge smiles on our faces and giddy with excitement. Julia Michaels was the opening act for the band. Breezing through her hits such as “I Miss You,” she also covered a few songs she co-wrote, like Selena Gomez's “Good For You.” She received a loud round of applause when she finished off her set with “Issues," granted that half the stadium had been empty until after she'd walked out. The crowd was diverse, with both families carrying their six-year-olds and teens like us. The majority of the crowd was middle-aged for sure, only reflecting how long Maroon 5 had been in business. 
Maroon 5's entry on stage received an energetic welcome, which the band used cleverly as they kicked off the concert with "What Lover's Do," one of the less energetic songs off the setlist for the night. This was followed by “Payphone,” after which Matt Flynn, the band's drummer, had a brief solo. The crowd was back on its feet. With only one brief break in the middle, the concert was seamlessly going through 20 tracks in around two hours. The energy remained electric, with Adam Levine staying on the V-shaped ramp the entire time, occasionally joined by James Valentine, the band's guitarist. Levine and Valentine treated the crowd with guitar riffs between performances and apart from this, every band member had a brief solo as Levine introduced them. The high points of the concert were definitely Maroon 5's older hits including "This Love," "Harder to Breathe," "Makes Me Wonder," and "Sunday Morning," for which the band returned to its old rock sound and the lighting shifted to black and white, creating a nostalgic feel. The setlist was ingeniously carved out, with the lesser fan-favorites like "Don't Wanna Know" and "Cold" interspersed with more popular songs to keep the energy going. Maroon 5's Michael Jackson cover, "Rock with You," was a treat to watch but I preferred their mashup of Alphaville's "Forever Young" and "Girls Like You.” Both songs blended well together and had the crowd standing despite the song's slower beat. 
The band took a brief break before performing "She Will be Loved," in which Levine expressed his gratitude to all the people who came out. He pointed out a 6-year old in the audience, more than thirty years younger than him, and talked about how incredible it was that she actually knew him and that the band had managed to remain relevant for so long. During "She Will Be Loved," as the crowd sobered up, Levine could actually be heard completely for the first time since the concert began. Making a few modifications to the song, Levine and Valentine had a single light focused on them while the rest of the stage plunged into darkness as they performed. It was my favorite performance of the night as it not only showed off Levine's vocals but also had an intimate feeling to it. The crowd swayed on its feet as they sang, with less of the fanatical screaming that had been there moments before. 
"She Will Be Loved" would have been the perfect ending to the concert in my opinion, but Maroon 5 closed off with “Sugar,” carried effortlessly by Levine's falsetto that always had the crowd screaming. The concert ended on a high note, with fans still on their feet as the band took a bow and departed. Although the stage held the cubes, the symbol of the Red Pill Blues album, the concert was a tribute to everything the band has accomplished over almost two decades. Even after all this time, Maroon 5 still knows how to give a timeless performance.

Gaucho Parrilla Argentina, or Gaucho for short, is an Argentinian steak restaurant featuring a wood-fired grill menu. It is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh, if not my favorite. It’s great for any occasion: catching up with an old friend, going with a big group of people, or bringing your family when they visit during family weekend. This time, I brought my sister, who was visiting, to see if it lived up to her steak-loving standards.
Gaucho is tucked in a small building on Penn Avenue in the Strip District, a couple blocks down from the buzzing part of the neighborhood with Wholey’s, Primanti Bros., and many street vendors. The Strip District is one of the most fun and unique neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, but it’s also one of the more isolated areas to go to for students; the only bus that will take you straight there from Oakland is the 54 bus. There’s always Uber or Lyft, but the 15-minute bus ride on the 54 isn’t bad, especially if you go with a group of friends.
Inside Gaucho is all hard wood, chalkboards, and rustic vibes. When you walk into the restaurant, the first thing you see is the expansive black chalkboard along the wall displaying the menu in colorful chalk. The space is energetic and lively, and as expected, the line to order and pay for your food goes out the front door. Pro tip: if you want to go for lunch on Saturday, try to get there before it opens at 11 a.m. – I guarantee there will already be a line when it opens.
The expansive menu has many choices: plates, sandwiches, salads, and streak platters, as well as sides like empanadas and roasted cauliflower. The steaks are offered in flank, NY strip, ribeye, sirloin, and filet mignon.
My go-to order is the Carne sandwich, with steak, chimichurri, grilled peppers, and caramelized onions (nicknamed “carmies”) on ciabatta. My favorite cut of steak is a medium rare filet mignon, but I also love their ribeye. This time I ordered the sandwich again, along with one for my sister and the El Gaucho salad, which consists of greens, carrots, radish, grape tomatoes, grilled corn, and avocado dressed with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. We each added a Mexican cola as well.
After we got to our table, we immediately made a beeline for the sauces. To the side of the seating area, patrons can spoon out as much of the homemade sauces as they want: the choices are chimichurri, ajo-garlic, pimento-red pepper, and cebolla-onions. Personally, I enjoy the chimichurri and the pimento-red pepper, but they are all great to spread on the sandwich or dip steak into.
The sandwiches are delicious. There are many different ways to eat them, since they’re so big. Sometimes I cut it in half and slowly eat one small bite at a time. I’ve seen others cut up the steak and the bread and use a fork. Whatever the method, nothing takes away from the deliciously fired filet mignon, the powerful punch of the grilled peppers, and the sweet flavor of the caramelized onions.
This was the first time I tried one of Gaucho’s salad, and the El Gaucho did not disappoint. The vegetables were fresh, and the mix of carrots, radish, grilled corn, and avocado was refreshing. The dressings enhanced the flavors but didn’t overpower them.
With our enormous sandwiches and splitting the salad between us, neither my sister nor I could finish our food. We were completely stuffed and happy to bring them home for leftovers the next day. Not to mention, she loved everything.
I’ve been to Gaucho several times over the last couple years, and it has never disappointed. It was the first time I’d tried Argentinian food or had steak in a sandwich. The restaurant is unique, the people are always friendly, and it fits nearly all occasions. But most importantly, the food is amazing. Even if you don’t like steak, I would still recommend it. They have chicken, pork, burger, and vegetable sandwich options, as well as several different salad choices.
Since its opening in 2013, Gaucho has become a staple on must-try Pittsburgh restaurant lists. It’s easy to see (and taste) why.

As as subgenre of animation, anime tends to be somewhat overlooked and underappreciated in Western nations. It has garnered notable cult followings in recent years and is becoming more popular, but there is still a certain stigma associated with anime. It’s a shame, because the subgenre has some of the best animated shows and films ever made, including Spirited Away, Full Metal Alchemist, Death Note (the first 25 episodes at least), Grave of the Fireflies (my personal favorite), and the subgenre’s arguably most influential film, Akira, which I got to see again at Row House Cinema as part of their anime week celebration. 
Set in a dystopian 2019, Kaneda, the leader of a motorcycle gang in Neo-Tokyo, gets caught in the middle of a government conspiracy after his friend, Tetsuo, gets psychic powers following a motorcycle accident. Essentially, it’s as if Blade Runner, A Clockwork Orange, and an old Disney animation film had a child that was high on acid. There is a lot that can be said about the film’s presentation of topics like corruption, capitalism, or its metaphors for the Japanese paranoia about nuclear weapons and post-WWII anxiety. But perhaps nothing is more impressive about Akira than the animation and its importance for the film’s storytelling. 
Akira uses cel animation, which means every frame was hand-drawn. With cel animation, animators use layers of celluloids, which are plastic transparent sheets that they can draw on to create a single frame. Usually there are four to five layers for each frame: a background layer, two or three separate layers for characters, and another one or two separate layers for more specific animations, like mouth or hand movements. Although computers are often used in modern anime to speed up the production process, there were no computers in 1988 to help animators. Therefore, everything had to be done by hand. While many anime studios would cut corners with the animation if possible, the creators of Akira broke new ground by animating every single frame. Keep in mind that for one second of motion in the film, there are 24 frames, and each frame has to be animated individually. The film is about two hours long, which means the animators had to create over 172,000 frames by hand. Akira also broke ground by having several frames that used nine celluloid layers, compared to the standard four or five. Since the animation was done frame by frame, all the dialogue had to be pre-recorded, and the movement for mouth and facial expressions had to be accurately animated around the voice acting. 
This creates a really smooth animation style where every single detail of the world beautifully comes to life. There are several sequences with complex camera moves, and even simple moments like red neon lights glowing off a character’s face are guaranteed to make your jaw drop. In fact, the lighting is the most impressive part about the animation. With cel animation, the light is created completely from scratch, using external light sources, camera placement, and the animation of different shadows and lights on the celluloids themselves. Akira also faced another challenge of having to use the lighting to create a cyberpunk world, characterized by futuristic neon lights mixed with the visuals and themes of classic noir. Despite having to animate all elements of the lighting for each frame and maintain their continuity, there are practically no faults. It’s a testament to an incredibly ambitious team who were clearly invested in every aspect of their craft.
Having control over every minute detail in a movie provides opportunities for incredible storytelling. Especially with animation, the presentation should give storytellers several opportunities to infuse subtle meaning in the story. For example, consider the setting itself. The film juxtaposes the flashy, futuristic cityscape that supposedly represents progress against the corrupt authority figures and seedy, violent youth who control the streets of Neo-Tokyo. Going back to the precisely constructed lighting, it’s more than just a tool to build the world, but also a recurring motif throughout the story, with different types of lights signifying different things. The neon lights signify the distraction and emptiness of modern consumerism, a signature feature of the cyberpunk genre’s cynical view of a technological dystopia. The streaks of light coming off the backs of the youth gang’s motorcycles are visual markers of their carefree and often violent escapades. Even the title of the film, Akira, translates to the word “bright.” These are just a few of the many examples of how great animation elevates the visual storytelling of the film. 
Now this review focused solely on Akira and its significance in the anime subgenre in general. But really, Akira is just an example of animation at its best. An audience member doesn’t need to be literate in the techniques of animation or understand every little detail behind it to appreciate what makes it so great. As viewers, we can tell when something is truly special, even if we can’t put our fingers on what makes it that way. That’s the wonder of great animation. It sucks us into a different world, and we can believe that it’s real. Too often now, mainstream viewers are left with predictable, low-effort, and bland animated films that don’t take advantage of their medium, but instead present packages of sound and color that only entertain younger audiences (The Boss Baby, Minions). But films like Akira represent everything animation should be: a source of endless creativity and wonder that treats its audience with respect, and a film they deserve to see.

Telltale Games — there’s no denying that they had a significant impact on the popularity of narrative-driven games. Famous for their The Walking Dead series and The Wolf Among Us games, Telltale crafted a unique episodic form of storytelling that emphasized the importance of the player’s choices. The company specialized in branching storylines and provided a greater degree of agency to the player, allowing their choices to affect later plot points and character relationships. Their games had served as a source of inspiration for many — myself included — and at one point were a bright narrative light in an industry populated with first-person shooter games like CS:GO. Innovative in their storytelling and true to their comic book-like style, Telltale had revitalized the public’s love of longer-form narrative games.
Unfortunately, in a statement released on Sept. 21, Telltale announced that they were beginning “a majority studio closure following a year marked by insurmountable challenges.” The layoffs left 90 percent of the company’s employees jobless and without severance pay — that’s over 200 people suddenly left without work and with zero financial support. While the game industry is not particularly stable, these mass layoffs came as a shock to Telltale fans and employees alike. 
According to CEO Pete Hawley, a big factor in the company’s demise was their increasing financial insecurity. 
“It’s been a difficult year for Telltale as we worked to set the company on a new course. Unfortunately, we ran out of time trying to get there," Hawley said to IGN. "We released some of our best content this year and received a tremendous amount of positive feedback, but ultimately, that did not translate to sales.” 
But financial insecurity seems more like a symptom than the real issue; perhaps a more likely cause for the decrease in sales may be the success of video game YouTubers — “Let’s Players” — and a detrimental departure from Telltale’s usual narrative style.
Telltale’s first The Walking Dead series was a massive success. Consisting of four “episodes,” each with a few hours of gameplay, the game incorporated elements of the popular TV series while it crafted an entirely new story. Rather than retell the story of the TV show, the game instead took inspiration from The Walking Dead comics, an inspiration that is visible in both the story and the art style of the game. To add an element of individuality to the game, a major device used was player agency: there are particular moments in the story where the player must make an important choice, which will significantly affect the rest of the game’s plot. Because of this mechanic, no two playthroughs were exactly the same.
As their success grew, the company grew as well, and they began to regularly churn out games. However, customers have complained that the newer games have lost touch with the beloved “choice” mechanic, where player’s choices don’t actually have any significant impact on the rest of the game. Each player would eventually end up with the same story, no matter what choice they made in their playthroughs, and fewer people would purchase the game. Instead, playthroughs on YouTube grew increasingly popular — if every story would be the same, why buy the game if they can watch it play out for free? These two factors and the increased uniformity of the games might have declined sales, placing Telltale into financial trouble.
However, on Sept. 25, four days after the mass layoff, the company made an announcement. 
“Multiple potential partners have stepped forward to express interest in helping to see The Walking Dead: The Final Season through to completion," Telltale stated. "While we can’t make any promises today, we are actively working towards a solution that will allow episodes 3 and 4 to be completed and released in some form.” 
This initially seems positive, but this statement just added fuel to the fire. Former employees and fans were angered that Telltale would outsource developers to finish a product, yet fail to provide financial support for workers who had developed the game for years. It’s incredibly difficult — nearly impossible — to hire on a brand-new team to finish a product where the previous development team left off. Many of Telltale’s employees have developed the series since the beginning, pouring their voices and personalities into their work. Outsourcing game developers won’t result in a game similar to the ones they’ve already produced and enforces the idea that game devs are replaceable — that their voices and creative work aren’t distinguishable from another’s. In a field that depends heavily on a cohesive and creative vision, this false hope is insulting to both the 200+ employees they laid off, and to their customer base as well.
Adding to the controversy, it was revealed that Telltale’s workers were incredibly overworked and mistreated during their employment. 
Hannah Bradshaw Lozier, a former employee, stated via Twitter, “Everyone was underpaid at Telltale, but programmers who could’ve gotten six-figure jobs elsewhere took anywhere from a $30k to $60k per year PAY CUT to come work for us.”  
They had repeatedly asked their employees to overperform and work past “reasonable limits,” creating a toxic stress culture without any sort of compensation. Various former employees have also spoken on the constant overload of work, with some employees working extended hours without overtime pay, sometimes devoting over 100 hours per week to push a product to the end of the development chain. While unfortunately not an uncommon practice, the reveal opened the public’s eyes to labor issues within the gaming industry.
But not all is lost for the former Telltale employees: in a big movement on Twitter, game companies big and small came to the rescue of the 200+ jobless individuals, posting job openings and reaching out to Telltale alums. Links to GoFundMes, Twitch streams, and other donation channels popped up by the tens, a testament to the strong support from the gaming community for the creators of the stories they loved and the incredible networking opportunities social media can provide.  
Telltale Games was a significant figure in the game industry, but its downfall is a telltale sign that something in the game industry needs to change to avoid further mistreatment.

My mom came to visit me this weekend, so of course, we had to find the perfect spot for breakfast (or brunch). And what better place is there than good old Panera Bread! 
The location: The hotel that my mom and I were staying at had a Panera on the ground floor, which was very convenient for the both of us! It’s a pretty decent-sized Panera (I think a little larger than the one in Oakland) and what I liked most about this one was that it wasn’t very crowded. It was around 7:30 a.m. when my mom and I went, so I guess it was a little too early for most people to start eating breakfast. 
The food: For the longest time, my favorite part about Panera has always been their bakery. I love all their pastries, and it’s so great how they’re all displayed right in front of you. My mom and I usually order this glazed pecan pastry to share, so that’s what we got. The freshness of their pastries does really depend on what time you go, but at least in my past experiences, their pastries have been pretty tasty and fresh. 
Panera’s non-pastry food I would say is pretty okay. It is known to be one of the healthier fast-food options, so I guess that’s a plus. My mom and I would usually get bagels from their bakery for breakfast, and those are pretty good. I also appreciate some of their sandwiches and paninis, especially their chicken caesar sandwich (which I actually don’t know if they still serve). Even though Panera is a fast-food chain, it still is a cafe, and certainly not a bad one. 
The vibe: Every time I go to Panera, I usually get some really chill cafe vibes. The music is always very relaxed and the employees I’ve met are pretty friendly. There are also various options for seating (tables or booths), which is great if you can’t decide between eating in a more public spot or having a little more privacy. 
Lit or Nah: Nah. I think Panera’s a good place if you want to quickly grab some cafe-style food, but I don’t see it as anything more than that. The environment is very relaxed and I feel like most of their customers are elderly people (although, it depends on which Panera you go to). If you’re looking for more of a fun atmosphere, I suggest seeking out more unique cafes and eateries. Of course, this doesn’t mean Panera still isn’t great. It’s a classic go-to, the food’s simple, and you can still have fun there as long as you’re there with someone who makes you happy.

This week, McConomy Auditorium will be screening Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the sequel to the recent reboot of the Jurassic Park series. The film picks up after the events of the first Jurassic World where Isla Nublar, the initial home of the dinosaurs in the first film, is about to be destroyed in a volcanic event. Our protagonists, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), are trying to save the dinosaurs from going extinct. However, as in every Jurassic Park film, not everything goes according to plan. 
This film is definitely for those looking for light entertainment. You just need to turn your brain off and watch two hours of dinosaurs and destruction. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard essentially play themselves in the film. Jeff Goldblum reprises his original character from the first three Jurassic Park movies. That’s really all you need to know. Don’t try to follow the plot, character motivations or arcs, scene structure, or other basic storytelling elements because that's just not the point. The action is decent enough to carry the film if you just ignore the story. There is really nothing else to talk about apart from that. The cinematography isn’t notable, the special effects are just there, and overall, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is an empty husk of a film. Simply put, if you go in expecting anything else, you will be sorely disappointed. But if you like dinosaur action and Chris Pratt, you'll have a great time.

Dear Izzy,
So I’m a really quiet and shy person, and I often fade into the background of things. Sometimes when I’m with my close friends, I’m the one starting up conversations and making people laugh. But other times if I don’t know as many people in a group, I can clam up and close myself off, and then a barrel of insecurities try to mow me down. It’s the degrees of separation that make a difference, y’know?
I feel like this aspect of me ends up putting myself at a distance between myself and my more outgoing friends. I want to be more open and get out of my comfort zone more, but I also don't know if I'll clam up again. I'm having a really rough time with this, do you have any advice?
Closed Like A Mussel
Dear CLAM,
Let me say upfront that there’s nothing wrong with how you are feeling! There is always something comforting about taking a weekend off to just stay in your room and take time for yourself. It’s easy to lose touch of that "me time" in the midst of college, so don’t abandon it entirely.
Talking with your friends about your insecurities will seem really scary, but it is honestly one of the better solutions. I encourage doing something smaller and more low-key. Don’t be afraid to vocalize how you’re feeling and take control of how you want to spend time with your friends, I'm sure they'll understand. And who knows, some of them might even feel the same way you're feeling.
If you want to commit to opening yourself up more, start small. Start talking with your friend’s friends, and slowly branch out to their friends of friends when you’re ready to. It’s little changes like these that can often make the biggest impact, so start small – and your comfort will gradually grow.
Most importantly, don’t change who you are and try to be this super social butterfly to appease your friends. If you’ve already talked to them and they're not even trying to accommodate your needs, then they don’t care that much about how you really feel. It’s a hard pill to swallow, and I’m sorry if it comes out harsh. But your own personal well-being and comfort are way more important than what other people think about you. So no matter what happens, just do you. That’s the big takeaway.
Hope this helps!
Izzy

The College of Engineering Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC), hosted in the Wiegand Gymnasium and Rangos Ballroom this past week, was teeming with both anxiety and excitement as employers met with potential employees from across campus disciplines. For some, it was not just an opportunity “to make connections for both full-time and summer employment,” as the official event website states, but rather a showcase of the military-industrial complex.
Carnegie Mellon’s Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) protested the conference on Monday, Sept. 24, for the reason that “some of the attending institutions are, simply put, bad for humanity,” as explained in the flyer they handed out to attendees.
The SDS protest took place outside of the conference by the Black Chairs in the Cohon Center, with around 10 members distributing flyers and talking with attendees, representatives, and the organizers of the event. There were three speakers from SDS who stood on a table in the middle of the Black Chairs using a bullhorn.
Drama student Larry McKay, technical writing student Wilson Ekern, and philosophy student Hazel Grinber gave first-person accounts of growing up after 9/11, read articles about the impacts of drones, and told students and recruiters that they were not asking them to give up jobs in subjects they were passionate about, but to also consider the impacts of what they were creating. Onlookers at the black chairs largely continued preparing for the TOC, but some looked on with bemused interest.
The bullhorn use led Carnegie Mellon University Police to intervene in the protest and get protesters to quiet down, who continued to distribute flyers and converse for around 15 more minutes.
The flyer, titled “4 Companies You Should Avoid at the Technical Opportunities Conference,” listed Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics Mission Systems, Honeywell, and Bechtel Marine Propulsion Corporation as companies to “steer clear of at the TOC.” Each company was given a specific write up of ethical hazards. For example, Lockheed Martin was described as a company that made “$50.1 billion in 2017 alone, [building and selling] missiles, planes, helicopters, automated defense systems, space weapons and other products specifically designed to harm human beings.”
The protest continued briefly without the use of the bullhorn, but as Calvin Pollak, an SDS member and Ph.D. student recounted, University Police “told us that if we went outside, we would not be able to use amplification for our protest,” which he called “absurd, because numerous campus organizations use amplification by the fence or on the Cut.”
As far as the success of the protest is concerned, both Pollak and Rosie Haynes, a Logic and Computation and Political History sophomore, state that the protest was at least effective in fostering a conversation on campus about the military-industrial complex and the corresponding on-campus apathy to defense contractors’ presence.
Haynes said of people’s negative responses to the protest, “So many seemed immediately turned off by our presence, people certainly don’t appreciate when others bring questioning of their morality to the table when they are trying to present their best selves to these companies.”
Regardless, the protest raised points on defense contractors’ participation in the TOC, how we discuss these issues on campus and the future of Carnegie Mellon University’s relationship with defense contractors and weapons manufacturers.

This past week, former Congressmen Rep. David Skaggs (D-CO) and Rep. Donald Manzullo (R-IL) visited Carnegie Mellon as part of the “Congress to Campus” program to promote bipartisanship and to get young people interested in public service.
The former congressmen gave a lecture titled “Closing our Political Divide: A Bipartisan Approach to Legislation” on Sept. 27 and sat down for an interview with The Tartan. In the interview, they discussed the value of bipartisanship in politics, the importance of public service and voting, their opinions on the president’s conduct, and their take on the single headline that has dominated political news for days — the hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Skaggs’ work promoting bipartisanship goes back two decades, around the time when he says modern hyper-partisanship started influencing national politics. He created the House Bipartisanship Retreats, which went on for eight years, in order to give Republican and Democratic representatives the chance to know each other as human beings and as more than just political adversaries. He and Manzullo, through the “Congress to Campus” program, want to demonstrate that despite the partisan politics that dominate the evening news, people of both parties can — and do — work together, even in today’s Congress.
Both Skaggs and Manzullo emphasized that they also wanted to get young people interested in public service. “Our big concern is that a lot of people are not becoming involved in public service because they don’t think it’s worth it,” said Manzullo. Part of their goal is to impress upon students that public service is a worthwhile alternative to all the competing opportunities out there.
They expressed concern about polls repeatedly showing extremely low levels of public faith in Congress. Manzullo cited a study that showed Brussels sprouts and proctologists seemed to be more popular than Congress, and said that there was “something going wrong in America” if the House of Representatives — which he pointed out was also known as the “People’s House” — was held in such low regard. Skaggs added that although it is easy to blame the politicians for Washington dysfunction, “the politics of the country reflect the people of the country.” 
“[Politics is] not a spectator sport,” Skaggs asserted. If people are dissatisfied with current politics, Skaggs says “the answer isn’t just to dump on politicians, it’s to get involved [as citizens].”
It is well known that voter turnout is generally low, especially among young people. The former Congressmen noted that this was a contrast to their college years during the Vietnam era and the Civil Rights Movement, both of which spawned waves of student activism. In response to the problem of low voter turnout, Manzullo emphasizes the fact that there are close races in every election cycle, and that one cannot know which race will be decided by a few votes. He gave examples of past elections where the winner was decided by a dozen votes or less.
Skaggs added that other contributors to this problem were the educational system and the politicians themselves. He believes that there should be more civics classes that teach young people how the government works so that young people are able to make an informed decision when voting. He also lays some of the blame at the feet of politicians who tend to engage only older voters who are more reliable on election day. According to survey research, “if young people are...engaged with [and taken seriously] by politicians, [who then] ask them for their vote, they’ll respond to that,” Skaggs stated. In his view, since young people often feel ignored by candidates, it is no surprise that they tend not to vote
.
Manzullo and Skaggs weighed in on more specific issues within the current administration—specifically, the president’s general conduct in office and on Twitter. Manzullo came out unequivocally against President Trump’s off-the-cuff style online, which contrasts with the silence of current congressional Republicans. “I don’t think presidents should tweet! I’m serious! I think it’s a very cheap form of communication...a lot of people don’t think [before they tweet] and if you’re the president of the United States, you have to think very seriously about what you’re going to say,” he maintains. He calls it beneath the dignity of the presidency when Trump insults and attacks people on Twitter.
Skaggs agrees, saying that Trump has made a mockery of the office and that the president should not be a molester of women. They also agree that congressional Republicans need to speak up more forcefully against the president, because politicians have an obligation to challenge anything they don’t believe is right, including members of one’s own party. Both Skaggs and Manzullo did just that in office: Manzullo criticized President Bush heavily over tariff policies, while Skaggs filed a lawsuit against President Clinton over the line-item veto, which Skaggs believed was a constitutional violation.
The Kavanaugh hearings, which have gripped and divided the nation and forced Republicans to call for an FBI investigation into Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee is where the two diverge. Skaggs emphasized the “appalling fashion” that Senate Republicans handled the allegations, called them hypocrites because of how they held up Merrick Garland’s nomination for political reasons, and called on Kavanaugh to apologize rather than relying on what Skaggs termed “convenient memory” or committing perjury.
In contrast, Manzullo believed that Senator Dianne Feinstein should have handled the case better and referred the allegations to the FBI earlier. Rather than making it a public circus, he said that Feinstein should have confronted Kavanaugh privately and given him a chance to resolve it without dragging all of it into the limelight. He called it “unfortunate” for both Ford and Kavanaugh that the way it was handled caused it to become the political drama it is now. Both Skaggs and Manzullo, however, agreed that there needed to be an FBI investigation, which was ordered by the White House on Sept. 28.
The two former representatives also made some political predictions of their own for the upcoming midterm elections and beyond. Skaggs believed that Nancy Pelosi will likely hang onto her leadership position and become Speaker of the House again and that Democrats may pick up 230 seats in the House. He also believes that Trump will not likely finish his term, describing the president’s ego as having “no bounds.” Manzullo isn’t sure if Democrats will win the majority but thought that if they do win, it would either be a landslide or a very close margin.
Although hyper-partisanship seems to be the rage these days, Manzullo and Skaggs are trying to show us a side of politics that isn’t just about ramming nominees and legislation through at all costs but instead about finding common ground and working together to get things done.

It has been just over a month since the semester began, but the initial surge of excitement around campus has already settled itself into a more focused rhythm. As assignments are returned and the first round of midterms sweep through classrooms, students are getting a more accurate picture of their course load, and many are faced with a familiar question: should they drop a course?
Maddie Mianzo, a sophomore studying Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), is one such student who says she’s falling behind in one course. “I feel like I don’t have enough time to focus on this class with my current workload,” she says, echoing a feeling nearly every student has at least once during their time here. Though the unit system gives a vague idea of how many weekly hours a certain course will occupy, there is currently no way for students to know how busy they’ll be until a few weeks into the semester, once courses and extracurriculars are in full swing. The course drop policy acts as a contingency for the many students who put too much on their plate at the start of the semester, allowing them to drop a course without receiving a “withdrawal” grade.
This fall marks the implementation of a new add/drop deadline, a somewhat controversial action by the Task Force on the CMU Experience. While the Fall 2018 course add deadline remains the same as in previous years (the 10th day of class), students have much less time to drop a course: 31 class days now as opposed to 51 last year. On the calendar, the deadline was Nov. 6 during the fall of 2017; now it is Oct. 8.
This change, along with tighter restrictions on course overloading, was proposed by the Academic Policies and Practices initiative group, one of six such groups on the Task Force. In its Year 2 Progress Report, the Task Force cited student well-being as its motivation: “The proposed changes to policy and practice have the potential to improve not only the academic performance and overall well‐being of our students, but also the campus culture as a whole: to remove the perception that to succeed means you must overload. The overload restrictions and earlier add/drop deadlines are also likely to improve course access and diminish waitlist uncertainties.”
Earlier in the report, the group concluded that our previous extended timeline was a significant contributor to the “culture of excessively high workloads at [CMU].” The idea is simple: force students to drop a course earlier and save them a month of increased stress due to excessive workloads.
The original plan was met with strong resistance by students because it proposed the drop deadline be moved to the same day as the add deadline: Sept. 11. This two-week period, students argued, was far too short. In Jan. 2017, The Tartan published an editorial lambasting the shorter timeline, asserting that the add/drop policy “limits students’ flexibility and paternalistically suggests that students cannot make good decisions about when to leave a course.”
These sentiments were echoed nearly a year later by members of the Student Senate and the Student Body President’s cabinet, who successfully lobbied for a four-week extension of the drop deadline. Their efforts last spring led to the current Oct. 8 cutoff.
The challenge now, it seems, is awareness. There have been no official communications from the university regarding the new deadline, and some students are only discovering it after investigation. Mianzo, who reached out to her academic advisor when she realized her schedule was too much, was glad she didn’t procrastinate. “I didn’t know about the drop deadline changing, so I was surprised when I realized how soon it is,” she said, admitting that her decision felt a bit rushed.
Students on the fence about dropping courses will have to make their decisions this week. While the effects of this new policy on student mental health have yet to be seen, Mianzo is confident about her decision: “I still had enough time to make the right decision for me.”

EndTheRain, an organization founded by Carnegie Mellon senior Ben Kaplan, is focused on finding inventive solutions to the bevy of weather issues plaguing Carnegie Mellon students, most prominently Pittsburgh’s unpredictable weather and reputation as the “second dreariest city in the country.” Those very same weather issues deeply impacted Kaplan as well, who came up with the idea for EndTheRain with his roommate soon after they were caught off-guard one day and drenched by the rain.
Kaplan, the president and founder of the EndTheRain organization, had hardly planned on creating such an innovative organization when he arrived at Carnegie Mellon. Based on his research, many students are unprepared for downpours due to an unwillingness to carry around their umbrellas everywhere just in case they need them. EndTheRain seeks to remedy these issues through a variety of projects, the first of which is the Plaid Umbrella Project. This project involves setting up free umbrella dispensers at convenient locations on campus, so that students can pick up umbrellas whenever they need them.
Currently, EndTheRain has been testing the viability of the project by placing two garbage cans containing 12 umbrellas each at Doherty and Warner Hall; however, Kaplan has much more ambitious goals for the project. He would like to ultimately set up five to ten dispensers on campus before April, based on heat maps tracking students’ traffic patterns and other, similar research. With this information, EndTheRain hopes to place dispensers at locations convenient for every Carnegie Mellon student.
Additionally, EndTheRain is working on developing and designing more complicated automated umbrella dispensers requiring students to swipe their ID card to pick up an umbrella. Currently, Kaplan has reported that most students have indeed returned their umbrellas the next day as requested by the signs above each umbrella dispenser. That said, EndTheRain is working on acquiring these automated dispensers to reduce theft and abuse of the system. Currently, Kaplan estimates that each umbrella will cost about $5 when purchased in bulk and that each dispenser will cost about $500.
Members of EndTheRain have already made headway on procuring funding for umbrellas and umbrella dispensers, as well as on promoting the organization. You may have seen EndTheRain posters around campus proposing the construction of a dome around Carnegie Mellon to stop the rain from terrorizing students. Of course, these posters, as well as the name of the organization itself, humorously exaggerate EndTheRain’s ambitions, but Kaplan has reported that this method of promoting his organization has been quite successful at intriguing students and initiating conversations about EndTheRain.
Many students have already reached out to him to learn more about EndTheRain after seeing these posters. In terms of sponsorships and funding, EndTheRain has already reached out to Google, and plans to contact Amazon, Microsoft, Uber, and Facebook, as well as Carnegie Mellon alumni. EndTheRain has also applied to become a recognized student organization; if its application is approved, this would allow it to receive funding from the Joint Funding Committee, the Student Government committee responsible for fairly distributing the money acquired through students’ activity fees to Carnegie Mellon’s many student organizations. Lastly, EndTheRain plans to compete in the annual UPLift Challenge, which challenges students to come up with innovative ideas to improve common areas on campus. Winners of this challenge receive funding from the university.
EndTheRain is currently composed of ten Carnegie Mellon students including the aforementioned President Ben Kaplan and Vice President Rajat Mehndiratta. Even so, EndTheRain is always seeking new members to provide assistance on all its lofty projects.
“Our team consists of ten CMU students. We need all the help we can get and our current team members are actively developing and designing our automated dispensers, seeking funding for the project, and solving logistical problems like where to install the dispensers and how to deal with load balancing of the system,” says Kaplan.

This past week was filled with testimonies. Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified on Thursday before the Senate Judiciary committee, recounting a sexual assault perpetrated by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during his time in high school. Before this hearing, President Trump wondered about the legitimacy of her accusations, tweeting, “I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr Ford was as bad as she says charges would have been immediately filed with local law enforcement by either her or loving parents.”
Many survivors took to Twitter with the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport to share their own testimonies about why rape often goes unreported. These harrowing first-person accounts chronicle the shame and fear that often accompanies sexual assault and the victim-blaming that can arise when people do come forward.
The poignancy of the hashtag mirrors that of the #MeToo movement where those who had not experienced sexual assault or harassment were able to see how it affected those close to them, while those who had traumatizing experiences were exposed to a community of others who would be able to truly empathize.
Though these stories were impactful, the nature of the hashtag meant that survivors had to revisit experiences of deep trauma in a public forum with strangers criticizing and rehashing events that survivors may have never even spoken about to close friends. One woman who spoke to The New York Times, Lerato Chondoma, felt “exposed and overwhelmed” when it came to the response, even when it was positive.
The people sharing their stories in order to influence the public dialogue were unequivocally courageous. They told stories that were hard to tell because they felt that it was important in this moment. These stories helped call into question the notion that if an instance of sexual assault is not reported, then it did not happen. Telling these stories can be healing, lifting some of the secrecy and shame off of events where the victim should feel no shame.
But we can also question why, in this moment, we have to ask people to reopen and relitigate their experiences in sometimes traumatizing ways in order to legitimize the voices of those who have experienced sexual harassment.
When Ford first came forward, she did not want her identity to be revealed. She wrote a letter to her representative in California who passed it on to Senator Diane Feinstein. She also sat down with the Washington Post, who decided that they could not publish her account unless she went on the record.
She decided to hide her identity, fearful of how the public might lash out at her and her family. She likely remembered and considered the experience of Anita Hill who went through hours of excruciating testimony in front of an all-white, all-male judiciary committee, only to see the man who harassed her appointed to the highest court in the land while she was exposed to racist and sexist abuse for years after.
It took lots of reporting on her letter, reporters contacting her friends and coming to her house for Ford to decide that she wanted to go public: on her own terms. She said, in the Washington Post article that revealed her name, that she had begun to “feel like [her] civic responsibility [was] outweighing [her] anguish and terror about retaliation.”
One of Ford’s most memorable quotes from her testimony demonstrates how Kavanaugh’s assault continues to affect her. “Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter,” she said of the two boys who assaulted her. It was this emotional connection, even years later, that drew many to her testimony. The New York Times opinion columnist Frank Bruni stated, “She came across as both painfully vulnerable and unfathomably strong, which is to say that she came across as human. It was vital that we could be witness to that.”
It was only a few hours after Dr. Ford’s testimony that the accounts of sexual assault survivors may have once again changed the course of history. Activists and survivors Ana Maria Archilla and Maria Gallagher confronted Senator Jeff Flake in an elevator just after he had given his full throated endorsement of Kavanaugh, saying “had he been nominated in another era, he would have likely received 90+ votes.”
Gallagher told Flake “I was sexually assaulted and nobody believed me. I didn’t tell anyone and you’re telling all women they don’t matter...look at me and tell me that it doesn’t matter what happened to me.” After being confronted with the experience of a survivor, or perhaps in fear of seeming callous when faced with this story, Flake appeared to change course, demanding an FBI investigation before the Senate votes to confirm Kavanaugh.
Archilla, who leads the Center for Popular Democracy action told The New York Times that “When the #MeToo movement broke out, I thought about saying it — but I wrote things and deleted it and eventually decided I can’t say, ‘Me too.’ But when Dr. Blasey did it, I forced myself to think about it again.”
Archilla, like Ford, was reluctant to speak out because she was well acquainted with the response that people give to allegations of sexual assault are brought up, but she chose to speak out because she thought her words might have an impact, and they did.
Once again, the power of survivors’ testimonies was able to shift public opinion enough to affect outcomes. Centering and amplifying the voice of survivors is the right path when dealing with issues of sexual assault.
However, why can a senator only be swayed to support the legitimacy of the claims of those who have been assaulted when personally confronted with the raw trauma of two survivors? Activists like Archilla realized wounds can move the public, but it is important that we think about what we are really asking of survivors, from those who testify to those who share their experience on Twitter.

Politics is exhausting.
It feels like every time you open a newspaper or update your Google News feed (or however else you get your daily dose), the headlines are dominated by three recurring themes: controversies surrounding Kavanaugh, controversies surrounding President Trump, and maybe a few articles here and there about our international policy faux pas.
Unless you’re a robot — or are majoring in something related to current events — there are only so many articles about these topics that you can read before you lose your sanity. Even worse, news outlets recognize the fact that these are the stories that keep readers hooked, so if you want to read something other than what CNN or Fox or the Washington Post suggests, you must actively search for it.
With its fixation on the negative, the (liberal) media paints a very somber picture of our political landscape, making it seem like the future is even bleaker, and that all hope is lost. That’s the impression that most people get from this imbalanced reporting, and while I’d like to say otherwise, it’s mostly accurate. As it stands right now, American politics is anything but comforting, and as a nation, we’ve seen better days.
But the bad doesn’t invalidate the good, and there are politicians out there who are fighting against the tide, trying to remind us Americans about the values of our democracy and the principles that guide us both as citizens and as a proud republic.
One such individual is Beto O’Rourke (D – TX), the House representative currently running against incumbent Senator Ted Cruz (R – TX) for a seat in the Senate. If you haven’t heard the name O’Rourke before, I don’t blame you; with everything else that’s been going on, the Senate races have fallen by the wayside, though they’re important given how slim a majority the Republicans have.
So, what’s so special about this Democratic candidate?
Two things matter for politicians: their image and their message. In terms of his image, O’Rourke lucked out when, to discredit his legitimacy, the Texas GOP tweeted pictures from his past as a punk rocker, as well as his mugshots from his documented DUI offense.
On the surface, it seemed like a good idea; show that the opposing candidate was a hippie who lacks the authoritative personality for civil governance. What the GOP failed to anticipate was the cynicism and sense of humor that Twitter users tend to have, which caused this attack to backfire. In response to the released information, rather than feeling that O’Rourke was unfit for office, many users tweeted about how cool O’Rourke looked, or how awesome it would be to have a senator that was more relatable to the youth. Many commented on his mugshot about how hot he was, and some even likened his picture to a professional magazine cover.
If nothing else, the GOP helped O’Rourke with his image, revealing a rebellious and youthful side of the candidate that people connected with. This gave O’Rourke a lot of positive publicity which otherwise wouldn’t have happened without this stroke of serendipity.
Seizing upon this momentum, O’Rourke then focused on his message. His was more agreeable than the one championed by Ted Cruz, who warned that electing a Democrat would turn Texas into the next Silicon Valley.
I always caution from saying that a politician is a “good” politician, as politics is just another word for artifice. Officials eyeing election or reelection tend to flip their stances often to pander to the demands of their base and supporters, regardless of what they personally believe. Good examples of this would include Obama’s transition from being against same-sex marriage towards the beginning of his candidacy to being pro-same-sex marriage towards the end of his presidency, and the fact that many Republicans deny climate change to preserve environmentally damaging — but cost-reducing — practices for the large corporations that support them.
I won’t say that O’Rourke is a good politician, but relative to the vitriolic and incredibly polarized status quo, I will say that he’s better than most. At its core, O’Rourke’s campaign platform centers around traditional American values, ones that resonate strongly with Texans and conservatives. These include the right to free speech and protest (as evidenced by his response to the Colin Kaepernick controversy), an acknowledgment of the Second Amendment and diffusing myths about taking away everyone’s guns, and an emphasis upon the power of the people and the important role that every citizen plays in our democracy. This last point is crucial, as not only are Texans fiercely independent (the Lone Star State has threatened to secede from the Union more than once), but O’Rourke’s campaign doesn’t rely upon funding from any special interest groups or PACs, with most of its money coming from donations.
This makes a very clear statement: O’Rourke is running for the people, by the people, with the intent of bringing some compassion and decency back into American politics. In some ways, he evokes tones of the late Senator John McCain (R – AZ), especially when he defended Cruz over Twitter when the Senator and his wife were harassed at a restaurant this past Monday on Sept. 24. Standing up for an opponent is something that requires a sense of honor, something all too rare nowadays.
In truth, O’Rourke will likely lose, as Cruz is leading in the polls, albeit by a small margin. Regardless of if he wins, O’Rourke will have proven himself on the national stage and given us all some peace of mind that there are some decent politicians out there.

When the final Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald trailer revealed that South Korean actress Claudia Kim’s character in the film was none other than Nagini, Lord Voldemort’s serpent and future Horcrux, it felt a little out of place. 
Firstly, 'nagini' is Sanskrit for 'female serpent', and refers to a divine race of half-human, half-snake creatures in Hindu and Buddhist lore. However, Claudia Kim is clearly not an Indian actress. While author J.K. Rowling has stated that Nagini was a Maledictus, a blood-cursed female who eventually permanently turned into a beast, there was very little to show Nagini’s former human nature throughout the original Harry Potter novels. Most of the evidence stems from new material J.K. Rowling released on Pottermore.com, where she releases updates about the Wizarding World periodically. Apparently J.K. Rowling has been holding this secret about Nagini for 20 years.
So what should be an exciting reveal for fans of Harry Potter across ages comes across as another divisive and piss-poor attempt by J.K. Rowling to make her franchise more diverse and “woke” by throwing a non-white character that minorities can praise her for. Not only is Rowling appropriating another culture by not casting an Indian actress to play Nagini, but Rowling perpetuates problematic Asian and female stereotypes that you’d think would be abolished after the release of Crazy Rich Asians. As a performer in the Circus Arcana, Nagini embodies the exotic “Dragon Lady," and her destiny as Voldemort’s pet contributes to the submissive, weak woman stereotype. It feels far from exciting; it feels like she’s jumping on the new diversity-in-Hollywood bandwagon and cheating her way into staying on it.
This is also not the first time J.K. Rowling has done something like this. Rowling has been criticized before for her creative choices and retconning much of the Wizarding World. She’s been criticized for making Dumbledore gay three months after the release of her book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and then neglecting to include this information in the script for The Crimes of Grindelwald. She’s been criticized for appropriating Native American cultures in her writing on Pottermore. She’s been criticized for defending her casting Johnny Depp, accused of domestic abuse by his ex-wife, as the titular character Gellert Grindelwald. The list goes on and on, and it never seems to end. As a lifelong fan of the Wizarding World, it is incredibly tiring to see her get into issues like these again and again. 
Most relevant to this issue, she’s been criticized for her portrayal of Cho Chang, Harry Potter’s first love at Hogwarts. A member of Ravenclaw, the “nerdy house,” Chang repeatedly falls for white men, formerly dating Cedric Diggory (played by Robert Pattinson) before falling in love with Potter. Unfortunately, with Nagini, it eerily feels like Rowling is repeating herself within the Wizarding World.
However, what frustrated me the most was not how my favorite childhood franchise was becoming more and more problematic. It was not my realization that one of my favorite authors and creative inspirations was actually incredibly racist and couldn’t adjust with the times. What frustrated me the most was how people were talking about it.
A lot of Asians voiced their opinions online on their disappointment with Nagini’s representation, but most tweets that I’d seen of people who were frustrated by this came from white people. They agreed that Nagini’s portrayal was problematic, but they made a point to show how they were sick of J.K. Rowling retconning Harry Potter once again. Some criticized the concept of a Maledictus itself, failing to recognize it as an aspect of world-building that J.K. Rowling incorporated. Articles written by white women — or white men — talked about the larger problem with the Fantastic Beasts franchise that Nagini’s casting adds to. One Twitter thread that sent me over the edge was a white woman author who pointed out, “Here are some books that are actually diverse that you should read,” taking the problem in a different direction. She later set her account to private. The overwhelming reactions I had seen from Caucasians about Nagini, frankly, just pissed me off.
Make no mistake: Nagini feels like a step back of all the progress that Asian representation has made in the past year. What frustrated me was the amount of white perspectives that I had seen telling me that my own representation through Nagini was wrong and unjust, making Asians feel like damsels in distress to salve Caucasians’ white savior complex.
However, what is also frustrating is these perspectives snuffing out a glimmer of hope for The Crimes of Grindelwald. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, it is impossible to hide Claudia Kim’s excitement over playing Nagini.
“You’ve only seen her as a Horcrux. In this, she’s a wonderful and vulnerable woman who wants to live,” Kim says. “She wants to stay a human being and I think that’s a wonderful contrast to the character.”
There is a chance that Nagini in The Crimes of Grindelwald truly ends up being a fleshed-out character that enriches the stories of Newt Scamander, Albus Dumbledore, and the rest of the wizarding crew. But Nagini’s representation in The Crimes of Grindelwald feels flawed from the start, and the divisive discussion around everything regarding Nagini adds to the many clouds looming over a potentially problematic film.
This problem is not new to Nagini’s casting; in fact, it has probably arisen in almost every discussion of controversial racial casting. How we talk about representation and how we present diverse representation in Hollywood is not as heavily discussed as representation in Hollywood itself, because it feels like an incredibly touchy subject to talk about. In talking to my friends about this article — both white and non-white — I’ve prefaced my thoughts with “I’m not trying to sound like a douchebag.” Gatekeeping discussions about diversity feels hypocritical to the entire point about diversity, yet spreading misguided, misinformed, and misunderstood perspectives bring the conversation level and movement down as a whole. 
Does this mean that we should only trust Asians to properly represent the Asian experience? Well, hearing perspectives from said Asians brings a refreshing authenticity to the story. Filmmaking, however, is meant to be creative; inspiration can be taken from anywhere. What is important is to achieve a level of understanding through education and communication. Including diverse viewpoints is incredibly integral in achieving this goal, eventually helping to foster a more inclusive environment for generations of creators to come. Enriching those diverse viewpoints with more knowledge and awareness of global cultures is the first step toward making that happen.

In regards to her column "Making Spanish gender-neutral friendly," I suggest perhaps Ms. Taipe take one of the many linguistics courses offered at the university, because it is a nonsensical desire to "reform" a language as Ms. Taipe describes, saying  "we need to realize that gender neutrality needs to apply to the rest of the gender-natured language (e.g. bello versus bella)." Grammatical gender is an entirely different concept from human gender and is found in numerous languages. Whether an apple (the feminine la manzana in Spanish) is "masculine" or "feminine" has no meaning, and those two categories could easily be labeled something else. Activism should be focused on meaningful issues and not trying to change the structure of languages for futile purposes.

I seem to find myself in the minority in today's Democratic Party.
I disagree with the tendency of most Democrats (including political candidates for Congress and those in the news media) to constantly bash Donald Trump over his obnoxious personality and his divisive comments.
As very-conservative "Morning Joe" Scarborough has said on his MSNBC show, when Democrats talk negatively about Trump it just makes his supporters angrier and more protective of him, while corroborating their paranoid belief that the Democrats and the liberal part of the media are out to get Trump.  Rather, as Joe suggests, Democrats need to focus on communicating their values and telling the people how the federal government can be a force for good and can make life better for all Americans.
They don't seem to realize that most Americans agree with them that we need to protect the safety-net programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Food Stamps, College Student Loans, and Unemployment Insurance Benefits. Those are winning issues that we should constantly be talking about instead of trashing Trump.

I decline to speculate on events that may or may not have happened 30 years ago. It is entirely possible that whatever happened at the time was so traumatizing to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the clinical psychology professor at Palo Alto University, is that she couldn’t mention anything until a therapy session in 2012. Perhaps the nomination of U.S. Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court convinced her to take steps to make her story public, even if she had wanted to stay anonymous at the time.
None of these excuse the lack of due diligence exercised by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) upon receiving Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh in July. Not once did Feinstein attempt to confront Kavanaugh about the allegations during any private meeting with him or during any of the confirmation hearings.
By eschewing consideration for both the accuser and the accused, Feinstein demonstrated not a single ounce of genuine empathy for Ford. Instead, she wielded the accusation as a nakedly political weapon, to be unleashed at the most opportune moment for chaos. Is it surprising that many Republicans are crying foul at this eleventh-hour attack while some Democrats fume that this hadn’t been acted upon earlier?
Now we have a situation where some on the right have immediately dismissed Ford as a diehard #Resistance member willing to do anything to stop President Donald Trump while some on the left will believe Kavanaugh to be guilty no matter what evidence is eventually presented. The reactions probably would have been similar had these allegations become public earlier, but at least the allegations themselves would not have been used as a distinctly political tool. In that respect, Ford’s words should have, at the very least, been given the dignity of genuine consideration.
