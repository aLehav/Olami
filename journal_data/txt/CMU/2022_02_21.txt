This is Penalty Shouts, The Tartan’s sports column inspired by the New Yorker’s column, Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled column will focus on anything and everything funny in the sports world that is deserving of our comedic attention.
Los Angeles. The city of beauty. The city of hope and dreams. The city of dangerously high levels of air pollution. The city with a tradition of taking to the streets in the face of injustice. The city that just witnessed something never seen before in its history: widespread rioting and looting that forced police officers to take coercive measures to put down those who were destroying property, particularly small businesses. It’s disgusting that our law enforcement officers had to put their lives on the line to protect the city from dangerous mob rule.
Of course, I’m referring to the post-Super Bowl riots of 2022 in Los Angeles following the Rams beating the Bengals 23-20 in Super Bowl LVI, sponsored by Taco Bell. It’s a riot that only the horse-poop-eating Philadelphia fans can manage to rival. Fans set off fireworks in the middle of downtown L.A. Drunk white men attempted to replicate Snoop Dogg’s Crip Walk on top of an L.A. Metro Bus. Someone shot a man just for good measure. Unfortunately, he lived, to the chagrin of the police, who were looking for an excuse to bring out their most recent Department of Defense-gifted tank.
But in the damage done to L.A., no one has talked about the strange circumstances of the game that led to the Rams’ victory. I met with the NFL commission to discuss what exactly happened at the Superb Owl, a secret Illuminati party composed of thought-leaders in academia, media, entertainment, industry, and government.
“Yeah, we kind of messed up with the calls in the back half of the game. We were all pretty sloshed after that halftime show,” said Roger Goodell. “Personally speaking, I downed eight shots and did two lines of coke when Eminem took a knee. It’s just so painful to me that a great man like that would disrespect me the way someone like Kaepernick would.” I told him that Eminem was kneeling for Tupac. He responded, “Oh, he was kneeling for Tupac? That’s worse. I’m more of a Biggie fan myself.”
The CEO of DraftKings, Jason Robins, clarified the sports betting situation: “It’s a good thing those refs have that union. I was this close to having them executed when they gave the Bengals that touchdown 12 seconds into the third quarter. But I decided to be calm and called my lawyer to get the same union-busting firm that my friend Jeff Bezos used in Alabama against those Amazon employees. That fourth quarter was touch-and-go, but the refs pulled through after they got my letter from the lawyers. All of us try so hard to be nice to our employees, but threatening their jobs to make them work is just so much easier.”
The Superb Owl issued a formal apology to member Eric Garcetti, mayor of L.A., for damages caused by the Owl’s game-tampering. Garcetti graciously accepted the apology and a $2 billion dollar grant, which will be used to refund the police.

When did people really start to believe in their hearts that the Los Angeles Rams would win this Super Bowl?
Not in 2016, when the NFL decided that the game would be played at their home stadium, figuring that the 4-12 Rams had no chance of playing for the championship within five years. Jared Goff was the team’s rookie quarterback, and he was struggling. Defensive tackle Aaron Donald was a lone bright spot, but the third-year pass rusher couldn’t carry the team alone. Head coach Jeff Fisher was so bad at his job that he was fired with only three games left in the season — and then his replacement lost all three left on the schedule. The NFL, determined to play the Super Bowl at a neutral site, rewarded this dumpster-fire of a team — in their eyes, the least likely to play for the Lombardi Trophy — with the rights to host five years down the line.
Not in 2017, when the Rams decided that the best solution to their coaching woes was a 30-year-old offensive coordinator from Washington, an eight-win team the year before; the same quarterback coach who had ruined second-overall-pick Robert Griffin III, the coordinator who had elevated Kirk Cousins and then started the train in motion which ended in him being shipped off to Minnesota. Baby-faced Sean McVay, who accepted the job at a press conference with his parents in attendance in the audience, and who had only been allowed to rent a car for five years, was not the answer to the Rams’ problems. It was a desperate try by a desperate bunch of cellar-dwellers.
Not after the 2018 season, when the Rams, having gone all-in to win Super Bowl LIII, managed just three points against Tom Brady’s mighty New England Patriots. McVay was certainly more impressive than anyone had bargained for, but his big bet — that he could win the league championship in his second season by trading up for big names — had fallen flat. Jared Goff wasn’t all he was cracked up to be, receiver Cooper Kupp was mediocre, and while running back Todd Gurley put together a thousand-yard season, he wasn’t enough to win the Super Bowl. It was a team with the building blocks to be great, but the problem was that 2018 was the Rams’ last year to compete for a championship. Goff, Gurley, and standout wideout Brandin Cooks would all be gone by the end of the next year.
Not after these Rams secured a 27-3 lead over Brady in the divisional round, and then threw it all away and let him march back and tie the game with just seconds left. Not a soul thought that the Rams had a snowball’s chance in hell. It didn’t matter that they dodged overtime, didn’t matter that new quarterback Matthew Stafford got a lucky break with seconds to go and kicker Matthew Gay won the game with no time left. This wasn’t a winning team.
And maybe a little bit of hope burst through the curtains when the Rams showed up to the 56th edition of the Super Bowl and came out to a 13-3 lead, only for holder and punter Johnny Hekker to bobble the snap, turn the ball over, and watch the Bengals come within one broken tackle of running it back for two points of their own, but it was gone when Tee Higgins broke free on the first play of the third quarter for a touchdown and a 17-13 lead. The catch wasn’t without its share of controversy; as he caught the ball, Higgins grabbed cornerback Jalen Ramsey’s face mask and pushed him to the side. The defensive back fell, and Higgins hurried down the sideline to put the Bengals in the lead.
After the teams traded field goals, the Bengals led 20-16 with five minutes left in the game. Then Matthew Stafford put together one of those drives that you don’t really expect out of a Lions’ product, but one that makes legends. From his own 37-yard-line, Stafford hit Kupp for eight yards, Brycen Hopkins for six, and Cam Akers for three. On second down from the Bengals’ 46 with three minutes left, Stafford came through — a wide-open Cooper Kupp hauled in a pass at midfield and tore down the field, gaining 22 yards to put the Rams within striking distance. Then, he did it again for eight more, and Akers found a larger-than-expected hole in the offensive line and pushed his way through, holding onto the football for dear life, and ending up at Cincinnati’s eight-yard line. The two-minute warning stopped the clock.
Across the country, fans — even those with no ties to Los Angeles or Cincinnati, even those with no stake in either team — were on the edge of their seats. Coming out of this game, there would be a fairy tale story, one way or another. If the Bengals’ defense stopped the Rams, Joe Burrow, their young quarterback, would kneel out the clock, and the Bengals would have a hero’s welcome when they got back to Ohio. If the Rams scored a touchdown, Stafford would finally get his ring, Donald would get his, McVay would get his, and the turnaround would be complete. Stafford would never again have to buy himself a drink in Los Angeles, McVay would have a job for as long as he wanted it, and Donald — like he always talked about — would be able to let his daughter play in the Super Bowl confetti. And if Los Angeles scored, and then Burrow struck back? A new great would be born, and talks of dynasty would be in the air.
Los Angeles had four plays to bring down the house.
Incomplete pass.
Incomplete pass.
Two plays to save the season.
Incomplete pass.
Fourth down.
There was almost certainly a split-second after the pass hit the ground where it crossed Sean McVay’s mind to look for Johnny Hekker, the holder who’d bungled the snap on the extra-point attempt in the second quarter, and strangle him. Instead of 20-17, the score was 20-16; instead of being able to kick a game-tying field goal, it was fourth down and all the marbles for Matthew Stafford.
Except … except it wasn’t. The scoreboard still read third-and-goal, and a single flag was on the field. Granted, there was reason to believe there was a flag on the play. Before the snap, the Rams’ entire offensive line — every single member but the center — had false-started, but the referees somehow missed it. Instead, Bengals linebacker Logan Wilson was called for defensive holding, stopping Cooper Kupp from getting open and forcing the incompletion. At worst, it was borderline; most of the time, the call would never be made; by contrast, the false start would be called nine times out of ten. But it wasn’t, and the holding was, and the Rams had a free set of downs from the four-yard line.
Incomplete pass, second down.
And then, touchdown. Cooper Kupp took a pass to the right side of the end zone, and the crowd went wild. But before the Rams could even start celebrating, flags coated the field. Again. And this time, although there was an unnecessary roughness penalty on Bengals’ safety Vonn Bell, the one that crippled the Rams’ energy was a holding penalty. The penalties offset, and it was first down again.
Incomplete pass, second down.
Except somehow, this wasn’t for real, either. After holding onto their flags all night long, the officials penalized Eli Apple for pass interference in the end zone, again on an attempt to Kupp. It was first-and-goal, for the third time on the drive.
On first down, Stafford dove up the middle for no gain, and on second down, he found Kupp in the end zone for the second time in three plays. The star receiver looked around at the ground. There were no flags. He looked back at his quarterback, and he looked at Apple, lying flat on the ground after trying to make a play. Lastly, he looked at the football. Then pandemonium broke out, and the Rams allowed themselves to hope. Finally, someone believed. The whole country, it seemed, believed.
But they’d left Cincinnati a minute, twenty-nine seconds, and two timeouts — Burrow was ready to go to work. After a touchback, in two plays, he moved the Bengals 26 yards with throws to Ja’Marr Chase and Tyler Boyd to the Rams’ 49. The Bengals had a lot working in their favor. Their rookie kicker, Evan McPherson, had been nearly perfect on long kicks, with a longest kick of 58 yards, and no field goal misses — 14 for 14 — during the playoffs. All Burrow needed was another ten, maybe fifteen yards, and they could tie the game. But on second down, he went for broke, throwing it deep downfield on a route that Chase gave up on.
On third down, running back Samajge Perine seemed to find enough of a hole for the first down, but Donald came through. Knowing his season, his championship, and his dream rested on stopping the Bengals from getting this first down, he grabbed Perine, tackling not his body, but his arm — the one carrying the football. This play stopped Perine from extending the football out past the line to gain, and Donald managed to stop Perine just half a yard short of the first down. It’s not an understatement to say that this heads-up play may have saved the Super Bowl for the Rams.
Fourth and one.
For both of these teams, everything came down to this play. Convert, and likely give McPherson the chance to tie the game up — given how reliable he’d been, that seemed likely. Fail to pick up the one yard, and watch Stafford kneel down and watch blue and yellow confetti rain out of the sky. Burrow dropped back to pass, and the Rams charged. Ja’Marr Chase, meanwhile, was wide open on the left sideline, having dusted his coverage. If Burrow had looked left, he would have put the Bengals on the Rams’ 45, maybe the 40, with a fresh set of downs and enough time left to either score a touchdown or put McPherson in field goal range.
But by the time Joe Burrow looked to his left and cocked his arm to fire it to Chase, he had company in the backfield. The Bengals’ offensive line had chosen absolutely the worst play to implode. Left guard Quinton Spain put up no resistance as Donald ran around him to the left, and within two seconds of the ball being snapped, he had his arms around Burrow, turning him around so he couldn’t get the ball to Chase. As Donald brought him to the ground, Burrow flung it in desperation, the ball careening end-over-end through the air. It seemed to hang there forever.
As luck would have it, Perine was there. But, caught flat-footed after Burrow had looked to Chase, he wasn’t ready for the throw, and couldn’t get to the football. As it finally hit the grass, Donald jumped up, a look of pure jubilation on his face, tapping his ring finger. It didn’t take a genius to find out what he was saying — finally, he would have a ring. Burrow could do nothing but walk off the field with his head hung, while McVay, on the sideline, had his smirk wiped away by his massive defensive tackle’s hug, and as the clock struck all zeroes, the Gatorade shower that awaited him.
And then, finally, everyone believed in the Los Angeles Rams.

For the first time ever, on Feb. 17, the physics department at Carnegie Mellon held the Physics Slam, a gathering of affiliated undergraduate, faculty, and graduate students. The event, hosted by Dr. Gillian Ryan (Director of Undergraduate Affairs and an Associate Teaching Professor in the Department of Physics), was a chance for various speakers — professors and Ph.D. candidates — to give five-minute presentations about topics they were highly interested in or topics currently researching. For the audience, it was a chance for them to learn more about the happenings in the department.
The list of speakers consisted of Dr. Fangwei Sei, Professor Ben Hunt; Professor Rachel Mandelbaum, graduate student Byron Daniel, Professor Tina Kahniashvili, Professor Randy Fenstra, graduate student Matt Ho, Dr. Saheli Mitra, Professor Scott Dodelson, Professor Carl Rodriguez, and Professor Markus Deserno. 
Dr. Fangwei Sei, an assistant professor who will officially be joining Carnegie Mellon in June 2022, opened the evening with an overview of his work in discovering biological laws to quantitatively understand living systems. One of his most notable projects is the parametrization of a cell. Using tools from physics, engineering, and biology, Sei and his team  simultaneously measure the cell's age, membrane size, and overall health. He and his lab plan to join the Biophysics Initiative in the Department of Physics. 
The next speaker was Dr. Ben Hunt, a professor of Materials Science & Engineering, who gave a talk about what he considered the “coolest aspect of quantum mechanics”: macroscopic quantum mechanics — specifically, superconductivity. This feature can be achieved by cooling metal to a temperature at which it has almost zero electrical resistance. (Also, did you know that Dr. Hunt’s lab includes a fridge that can be as cold as 0.010 Kelvin? And that his main lab contains a superconducting magnet with a strength of 14 Tesla?) He then introduced the Quantum Hall Effect — another example of macroscopic quantum mechanics — which is the thresholding of resistance within an applied magnetic field inside a two-dimensional electron system. 
Then, Professor Rachel Mandelbaum introduced the audience to weak gravitational lensing, a measurement using data gained from large sky surveys. Weak gravitational lensing can be used to measure masses, specifically of dark matter in the universe. Her lab uses data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Hyper-SuprimeCam (HSC), which capture detailed images of the galaxy. Professor Mandelbaum’s research asks questions like, “How is dark matter distributed in the universe?” and “What are the main components of the universe?”
Graduate student Byron Daniels from the Parno Lab spoke of neutrinos, which are particles so small that if a neutrino were a marble, then an electron would be the size of a grand piano. For a long time, neutrinos were known as ghost particles because of their lack of charge and near-absent mass, as well as their lack of interaction with most other forms of matter. As such, neutrinos are some of the most common particles in the universe. Daniels also provided an overview of the KATRIN project, which seeks to find the mass of a neutrino by looking at the end of a tritium beta decay reaction, as well as the COHERENT project, which measures the oscillations of neutrinos off of atomic nuclei.
Professor Tina Kahniashvili centered her talk around gravitational waves in the early universe, and how many of the sources of these gravitational waves are astrophysical. She gave an overview of how LIGO and GAIA (both large-scale observatories) have made immense progress in the detection of gravitational waves and other perturbations in space. In addition, Professor Kahniashvili spent some time discussing her interest in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence research, which is applicable to many areas of astrophysics such as the intercluster medium and cosmic rays. 
Professor Randy Fenstra discussed scanning tunneling microscopy in his talk. A scanning tunneling microscope is used to study monolayers of material, usually a conductor, and examine surfaces at an atomic level. One of Fenstra’s most recent works, a paper published in the Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology in 2021, includes the acquisition of scanning tunneling microscopy data from a monolayer of WSe2 (tungsten diselenide) grown on epitaxial graphene on SiC (silicon carbide).
The next speaker, graduate student Matt Ho, presented work on the applications of machine learning in cosmology research. He used the Hercules cluster (also known as ABELL 2151), which contains many galaxies within the constellation Hercules, as an example of the many merging galaxies in the universe and how studying astronomy is difficult with the untrained human eye. Ho and his team are working on finding better methods of detection and analysis using principles from data science, statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. One of the most notable projects in their lab involves cosmological simulations (such as two merging star clusters with a super massive black hole in the center). These can be used as teaching material for machine learning and robots.
Dr. Saheli Mitra, from the MSIL lab, spoke about her work with biological membranes and antimicrobial peptides, which can be found within the immune system of most organisms. In collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh, Mitra and her team design antimicrobial peptides using different combinations of amino acids and analyze their interactions with bacterial cell membranes (which are modeled in the lab). The information gained from these experiments is used to develop antimicrobial peptides as therapeutic agents for diseases. 
Professor Scott Dodelson, the Head of the Physics Department, centered his talk around technological solutions that try to answer the question that has been asked for millennia: “How did we get here?" One of the answers includes a self-organizing map that groups galaxies into a single cell and finds the mean redshift value. A Fourier transformation can be taken of the map and squared in order to quantify the its smoothness with a power spectrum. Sky surveys can also be used to test, with high statistical precision, a canonical model that includes the existence of dark matter and dark energy.
Professor Carl Rodriguez, an assistant professor in cosmology and astrophysics, introduced the audience to binary neutron star mergers (in less than five minutes). A binary neutron star merger is the collision of two neutron stars in space, and is accompanied by the emission of gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals. To measure the interference with a gravity wave, the principle of LIGO is based upon a large version of a basic ether experiment. A laser beam is split in half, allowing the distances between the halves to change, and this creates interference that gravitational waves can be measured from. Thus LIGO is able to see perturbations in space, mainly those caused by dense objects moving at a fast speed. LIGO has seen many black holes as well as neutron star mergers. 
Using the data from measuring the gravitational waves as well as the electromagnetic signals, the researchers working on LIGO were able to identify specific regions in space associated with the first double-neutron star merger. 
And last but certainly not least, Professor Markus Deserno, whose interest is in theoretical and computational biophysics, ended the evening with a presentation on membrane asymmetry. Biophysics is the application of principles from physics and chemistry and the methods of mathematical and computational modeling to understand how living systems work.
One of the areas of Professor Deserno’s research is the role of asymmetry in membranes. Within the bilayer structure of the lipid membrane, the inner layer is noticeably different from the outer layer. This is an area worth exploring because “it’s rather involved to make such asymmetric membranes and then keep them asymmetric.” In other words, nature cares about maintaining this structure, though the reason is currently unknown. Membrane asymmetry is prevalent in many species of fungi, insects, worms, reptiles, and many other eukaryotic species. 
Some of the current findings in this area involve the heightened rigidity found in asymmetric membranes, with respect to their symmetric counterparts, and how cholesterol molecules are shoved across the membrane due to the asymmetry present. 
(Author’s note: All in all, this was a memorable event and hopefully one that will be repeated every year. Even if you aren’t a physics major or minor, it’s still a great chance to learn about what’s happening in the department and get to know people on campus.)

For a long time, purple sea urchins — also known as Strongylocentrotus purpuratus — have been the model organism for studying embryonic development, a pivotal topic in developmental biology. Urchins’ external fertilization system allows researchers to obtain a large number of their embryos, which develop relatively quickly and are convenient for observation. Using research from sea urchin development, researchers have made conclusions about gene expression changes and cell fate during early development.
On Feb. 16, first-year Ph.D. student Shaw Camphire presented his work from the lab of Dr. Charles Ettensohn, a professor of biological sciences. The research on sea urchin embryonic development was presented during the weekly Biology Research Club Seminar Meeting. The Ettensohn lab has done research on the competition between gene regulatory networks that define cell types during embryonic development of urchins. 
Gene regulatory networks (GRN) are networks of signaling and regulatory genes responsible for gene and pathway activation within the embryo. By understanding how gene regulatory networks function, scientists can learn more about genetic control in developing organisms.
To do this, researchers analyzed GRNs from sea urchins. They hope to apply their findings to other organisms, including humans.
Camphire began his presentation with the introduction of the GRN that controls the primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs), which governs the formation of the sea urchin embryo skeleton, and Alx1, a transcription factor known as the master regulator of PMC lineage.
Camphire described how the Ettensohn Lab previously performed RNAseq experiments that compared PMC-related transcripts and non-PMC transcripts. These experiments identified PMC genes (which code for the expression of PMCs) and non-PMC genes. 
The Ettensohn Lab then performed an Alx1 knockout to prevent its expression and determined the difference in downstream pathways. The team expected to observe a heightened expression of several PMC-related genes, but instead saw changes in the expression of non-PMC-related genes. 
This led the team to ask, “Why are these non-PMC-genes changing in response to the loss of Alx1?”
The answer they proposed was gene regulatory network competition. Their hypothesis claims that an active GRM will suppress other potential GRNs, and once removed, other potential GRNs can be expressed.
The Ettensohn Lab hypothesized that these other gene regulatory networks were mainly non-skeletogenic mesoderm (NSM) GRNs. The NSM is physically very close to the PMCs during a fairly early stage in development. The NSM matures into a ventral region and a dorsal region, each with their own specific cell types separate from the PMCs.
If gene regulatory network competition could explain their findings, then the Ettensohn Lab could expect that if Alx1 were no longer present in the embryos, then the cells that would have expressed the PMC GRN and repressed the NSM GRNs would no longer do so and instead might express other genes. This could explain an increase in some non-PMC genes.  
To verify this, the lab needed to determine if the non-PMC genes that increased in expression after Alx1 knockout were indeed NSM genes. If yes, it would support the idea that GRN competition was between the PMC and NSM GRNs.
Camphire planned to search for currently characterized NSM genes in the dataset of genes that were upregulated after Alx1 knockout. He would then investigate uncharacterized genes with greater expression during Alx1 knockout and possibly find the cell type in which they are expressed. If the competition hypothesis is correct, then the uncharacterized genes would also be NSM genes. 
So far, many of the uncharacterized genes were found to be NSM genes, and differentiated as either dorsal or ventral. Many of these observations were made during the blastula stage early in development. In terms of future research, there are still many uncharacterized upregulated genes that were identified though not investigated yet. 
All in all, Camphire’s work supports the gene regulatory network competition hypothesis, as well as the idea that the PMC GRN actively suppresses other gene regulatory networks during embryonic development. However, this hypothesis cannot be fully accepted without additional experiments that show PMC-fated cells expressing NSM genes after Alx1 knockout. Another member of the Ettensohn Lab, Ph.D. candidate Will Douglas, is currently researching this problem.

It’s no secret that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a crucial organelle. In most cells, the ER is involved in post-translational modification of proteins, calcium homeostasis, lipid synthesis, and other important functions. Recently, an enzyme localized in the ER, a GTPase known as Atlastin-1, gained prominence as a necessary component for mediating proper ER structure. 
In terms of clinical applications of ER fusion, prior research has linked impairments in ER function — possibly caused by improper formation of networks — to Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia, a neurological disorder characterized by spasms and weakness/stiffness in the legs.
On Feb. 16, at the weekly Department of Biological Sciences Research Club meeting, first-year Ph.D. student Ellie Lai presented her research during her rotation in the Lee lab about visualizing atlastin (ATL) dynamics during ER fusion. (In this context, fusion refers to the joining of tubules to form networks that make up the endoplasmic reticulum.)
Lai hypothesized that if ATL is specifically localized to fusion sites, it should be possible to visualize "hot spots" at presumptive fusion sites within the ER. If not, there should be an even distribution of ATL within the cell, regardless of where ER fusion is occurring.
For her experimental methods, Lai transiently transfected a red fluorescently tagged Atlastin-1 and a green fluorescently tagged general ER marker into tissue culture cells. Lai imaged the cells with confocal microscopy to gain five- to seven-minute long movie clips that showed the complete process within the ER networks.
The analysis of the clips showed instances in which Atlastin-1 did indeed localize at fusion sites before and during fusion, but disappeared afterwards. However, there were also instances within the ER that did not seem to have ATL enrichment during fusion. 
Building upon these findings, Lai plans to investigate further into the visualization of fusion events using optimized methods. Potential routes could involve finding ways to increase the number of cells that can be imaged for a more robust assessment or to identify more fusion events within the cell.

Note: This article may contain information that you would not know if you have not yet watched "Euphoria", particularly season two. AKA: SPOILER ALERT. Also, the interview material contained within has been edited for clarity.
Like many, the barrier of HBO Max stopped me from watching "Euphoria" for a long time. With the (gradual) release of the most recent season, though, I was fortunate enough to have a group of friends who proposed to watch it together. If you’re not familiar with the show, it focuses on the experiences of a group of high school students — led by a drug dealer and addict named Rue, played by Zendaya — in order to highlight socially relevant issues like gender, friendships, relationships, parenting, loss, addiction, sexuality, and sexual assault. To follow is a sort of paraphrased mass interview with the girls that I watch with — whom I’ll refer to with "Euphoria"-themed names. Our watch parties are beautiful in the way that we each bring our own experiences and perspectives to viewing, and I want to share that with you as well.
The Luggage (on how this season compares with the last one): “In terms of content, the new season is a lot more intense than the last season. Interestingly, the visuals are a lot different; things are less glorified. There are less colors and less lights and it's all these more intense events and things to watch without the softening aesthetic that used to be there. It almost seems like they’re easing us into a darker approach to what’s happening. In the same vein, even though there are still a lot of difficult events happening, it seems like they’re diving way deeper than the individual approach; it’s not just about Rue anymore, it's becoming about the drug industry at large.”
This seems true, especially after the last episode. We are exposed to a whole range of drug-related experiences that are in no way unique to Rue: withdrawals, the effects on family relationships, and potentially even human trafficking. It’s extremely dark, and there is absolutely no buffer for it. Something that we as a group incorporate into our watch sessions is the opportunity for an overload break; this show gets intense, and we collectively recognize that watching it all in one go might not be the most comfortable experience.
The Needle (on discomfort in Euphoria): “Personally I started watching a little later than most people and was surprised by how fast things became almost unhinged. Literally within the first ten minutes of one episode they broke the fourth wall. At times it became almost straight porn … [one scene involving a needle] genuinely gave me a nightmare, but the artistry and depth of the writing still makes me want to watch it and actually enjoy it.”
The writing and production of the work itself is certainly something to comment on. Stylistically, the show straddles a gray area between vintage and new-age, which as The Luggage mentions, is reflected heavily in the soundtrack. The show’s music includes new pieces from artists like Lana Del Rey and Laura Les mixed with classics from INXS and Steely Dan set on the recurring Labrinth backdrop — a kind of nod to the vintage/modern aesthetic coveted by so many youth right now.
The characters in "Euphoria" are equally complex and also equally significant to the overall experience of the show. Rue in particular has a sort of control over the story that many fans theorize about.
The Parrot (on Rue): “I don’t know if this is necessarily true, but I’ve heard a lot of people say that the reason things have been so crazy and jump around so much this season is because Rue is really the narrator and we are seeing things from her perspective. Because she’s really high, she’s becoming an unreliable narrator and we are seeing it reflected in the show's jumps and even weird camera angles because she’s focusing on things that you wouldn't normally focus on. That explains a lot of what’s going on right now, but if you didn’t get that it would be a [insert expletive here].”
Meanwhile, the state of affairs with the other characters is shaky at best. Much of the last few episodes have focused really intently on Rue or Rue and Jules, even though there is the ticking time bomb of Cassie, Nate, and Maddy to be concerned with.
The Luggage (on Maddy, Nate, and Cassie): “People spit a lot of hate on Cassie, but personally I am a Sydney Sweeney sympathizer. Of course I think they’re all sort of bad people, but people love to side with Maddy and forget that she’s really toxic, especially with Nate. A lot of the stuff they did last season was really horrible, and even though Cassie is a mess, I don’t think she should be the sole target of the hate.”
I couldn’t agree more — personally I think that if I was in Cassie’s situation, I would do many of the same things. While some of us are fortunate enough not to have to experience some of the things that happen in Euphoria, it’s a credit to the writers that the characters and their emotions and motivations still seem so relatable. Especially in a group, we share almost as much with the characters as we do with each other.
Every Sunday at 9 p.m., we gather in our dorm lounge and watch an episode on someone’s laptop. In itself, there's something wonderful about this, and I think it speaks to the nature of the show and its culture that we do this. I choose to ignore the capitalistic reasoning behind the weekly releases in favor of its drawing back of the traditional viewing of television. In the week in between releases, we are able to reflect on what we have seen and grow in anticipation for what is to come, increasing our motivation to watch as well as to communicate how we feel — almost as if we were part of an ultra-cosmopolitan book club. 
This discussion, and even the act of watching it together in the same room, is so integral to the show’s meaning. We are watching some of the most extreme and traumatic events that might happen in a teenager or young adult’s life today, we almost feel as if we need each other for support. We relate to things and we learn new things and we do it together, because more than anything, Euphoria is meant to be social. It's a conversation. It’s a conversation about where we are as people, what we endure, queer life, addiction, grief, trauma, love, and obsession. We watch and we bleed out what we’ve endured; it’s beautiful and it hurts just a little bit, but that’s just as it was meant to be.

The Mountain Goats, or John Darnielle and revolving company, make an art of doing whatever they want. Their music is incongruous, defying categorization. It’s urgent and driven and unceasing. Almost exhausting. Darnielle’s high, reedy voice sits atop strummed guitar with all the comfort of a bareback donkey ride. In early albums, the songs spit with static, a hallmark of being recorded on a cassette deck boombox, and make mincemeat out of Darnielle’s already irreverent singing style. The result should be horrendous, utterly unlistenable. 
And yet.
The thing to understand is that John Darnielle, at his core, is a canny artist. His voice is grating enough to be instantly distinguishable, but never so much as to destroy the music. The sharp, sarcastic intensity of his voice somehow never sacrifices sincerity. When he’s emotional, it’s poignant without being either heavy-handed or callous. His lyrics are idiosyncratic and raw, yet somehow meticulously paced. How many musicians could lament that “no one broke D.B. Cooper’s fall” without sounding like an idiot? 
Few people commit themselves so entirely to the literature of lyricism as John Darnielle. He does it frequently, almost flippantly. In “Family Happiness,” he mentions Tolstoy, a nod to the Russian writer’s short story by the same name. In “Spent Gladiator 2,” he references Stalin’s practice of collectivization in service of a simile and alludes to Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse Five in the same thirty seconds. 
This isn’t pretense. This is Darnielle truly and genuinely in love with writing. He is currently on a book tour promoting his third novel, Devil House; his first, Wolf in White Van, was nominated for the National Book Award in Fiction. But distinctions such as “author” and “musician” seem too limiting when applied to Darnielle. They aren’t separate spheres; in fact, they intersect, almost overlap, with aspects of one constantly informing the other. Darnielle’s writing comes out in aching, purposeful lyricism, and his musicality reflects itself in the rhythm and pace of his fiction.
In arguably his most famous song, “No Children,” Darnielle combines witty apathy and innate poeticism to explore a failing marriage. In keeping with the urgent, almost careless strumming and singing, the lyrics are selfish, dismissive. There is no such thing as “being the bigger man” here; Darnielle wishes misery upon himself, his wife, and everything that has witnessed their descent. He scorns cliches: “Our friends say it's darkest before the sun rises/ We're pretty sure they're all wrong.” And yet there is a sense of camaraderie between Darnielle and his wife even as they orchestrate this destruction, a “we” that crops up throughout the song. The husband will not go through this misery alone; there is a sort of sick enjoyment between himself and his wife as they engage in it. This is, in a way, a similar covenant to marriage. Then Darnielle utters his most famous lines: “You are coming down with me/ Hand in unlovable hand.” It is simultaneously a perversion of wedding vows as well as its most pure representation. He wishes fervently that the two of them will die, and his voice ends high, almost a question, the note never resolving even as the guitar persists. Till Death do us part.

This article contains spoilers for "Spider-Man: No Way Home"
I really liked “Spider-Man: No Way Home.” I’d dare say that I loved it. My ghoulish, 7-year old brain was flipping out seeing some of my favorite villains like Doc Ock and the Green Goblin come back from the old Sam Raimi trilogy without missing a beat. Willem Dafoe in particular was even more menacing than he was in 2002, and he has already become one of the MCU’s greatest villains. Seeing Tobey Maguire again as a wiser, older Peter Parker was nostalgia done right. I was excited about Andrew Garfield’s Spider-Man being redeemed, who was far and away the best part of the two awful movies he was in. It fixed pretty much every issue I had with Tom Holland’s Spider-Man, making him lose everything and putting him back to basics as a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man with a classic homemade suit living in a rent control apartment in New York. The action scenes, particularly the fights with Green Goblin, were fantastic. Most of the side characters who would have been distracting or annoying in other MCU movies had importance in this movie both for the plot, the themes, and the emotional payoffs. The plot itself is fairly stupid if you think about it for too long, but I can forgive it because the movie did so much right that it doesn’t matter. It had been a while since a large theater release actually was satisfying like that.
A week after this, I watched “The Matrix: Resurrections” and I remembered that most of these nostalgia bait movies still suck. I can’t really blame Lana Wachowski for not wanting to make this movie, because the Matrix trilogy was already finished in 2003. The story was done and nothing needed to be revived, and a lot of people didn’t like the latter two movies in the original trilogy anyway. But this new movie somehow found a way to be way worse. Not only was the movie a soulless, corporate cash grab from Warner Bros., but it is actively self-referential about it. But being self-referential about doing the bad thing doesn’t make it better when you do the bad thing anyway. That makes it worse. On top of that, the movie doesn’t move the story or world of the Matrix forward and actively undermines the story of the previous trilogy for no reason. Even the action scenes were all bad, which is what the original trilogy was renowned for regardless of people’s opinions on the story.
A lot of movies in the last ten years fall into the category of “corporate, soulless cash grab to capitalize on existing IP.” The “Star Wars” sequel trilogy had this issue, as did the “Ghostbusters” soft reboot, the new “Star Trek” movies with Chris Pine, and practically most other sequels, reboots, and remakes you can think of in the last ten years. This isn’t new for Hollywood; they have always been making these types of movies. The difference now is all these studios and distributors like Warner Bros. and Disney have so much intellectual property (IP) as a result of their growing monopoly in the film industry that they can sustain themselves off the IP for decades without needing to make original movies. 
It’s easy to make fun of these studios and chastise them for being soulless hacks who don’t care about art or movies, but honestly, moviegoers also share the blame. I keep hearing the phrase, “They don’t make them like they used to,” but the vast majority of the people saying that don’t keep up with the independent scene, where there is a lot of really great and original filmmaking. It’s not really their fault, because independent studios and publishers don’t have the same resources or budgets to make larger scale productions and market them the way a company like Disney does. But at the same time, you can’t complain about movies sucking now when Google is at your disposal and you can search up “good movies in 2022” and try to find movies that suit you and support those. Your demand is only as powerful as what you choose to support. 
The other issue is that the independent scene is a lot less accessible for general audiences, as they tend to be more challenging movies. But for a while, there were more mainstream, mid-budget productions where the filmmaking and storytelling still had the challenging nature of the independent scene while being more accessible for audiences. In other words, studios actually took creative risks more frequently. A lot of those movies would get marketed incorrectly or tampered with by the studio, but many times it wouldn’t matter because movies could recoup their costs through DVD releases. In fact, for all movies, DVD releases would be like a second opening run for movies. Obviously, this is not the case now with streaming, which I don’t even understand how the profit structure even works in that model. I don’t think the industry executives understand it either. But the consequence of this is that studios are less willing to take creative risks because if it doesn’t do well in the theater, then the movie is a sunk cost. 
The end result is that a lot of movies that people end up seeing are either really small, independent releases with relatively small budgets, or they watch these awful big budget movies that prey on nostalgia because it’s the easiest way to get buzz for an upcoming project. Even great studios like Pixar got relegated to churning out mediocre sequels with a glossy sheen in the last decade, a far cry from the studio that consistently pushed the boundaries of animated storytelling in the 1990s and 2000s. 
It’s not really hard to make a good sequel, reboot, or remake that still can contain new ideas alongside good filmmaking and storytelling. “Blade Runner 2049” is one of the best movies of the last decade and that’s a sequel to “Blade Runner.” “Spider-Man: No Way Home” is proof that even a big blockbuster in a saturated genre can still excite audiences and give them something new with elements and characters they know and love. But not every movie can be nostalgia bait. “Spider-Man: No Way Home” worked because the nostalgia elements had a purpose in the story. “Blade Runner 2049” worked because the original “Blade Runner” left a great foundation for future movies to explore the themes and ideas it brought up, which the sequel expanded upon in ways that were better than the original while also pushing the boundaries of filmmaking, unlike most big budget movies. 
I worry that Hollywood will look at the box office results of a movie like “Blade Runner 2049” (which failed at the box office) and a movie like “Spider-Man: No Way Home” and decide that the nostalgia bait is the easiest way to get people in the seats with no regard as to whether it is important for the story. But to be honest, it does seem like people are getting fed up with Hollywood’s shenanigans, as many of these sequels and remakes were underperforming in the box office even before the pandemic. If Hollywood takes the wrong lesson away from “Spider-Man,” I just hope that audiences continue to vote with their wallets and make it clear that Hollywood needs to stop making unoriginal and uninspired garbage.

Overdose: Special Guest Edition
This week, Pillbox’s editor Pria Dahiya reviews a ten-hour World War Two mini-series that she thinks you actually really will enjoy. The show has a lot of cute boys!
I cannot stress this enough: "Band Of Brothers" is so good
Wahh wahhh wahhh covid wahhh wahhh wahhh work wahh wahh wahh stress boo hoo. Have yall ever heard of WAR!?
My priorities radically changed this past week when I, COVID-riddled and homebound, began watching the 2000 HBO miniseries “Band of Brothers” with my very good friend and roommate who also happens to be an expert on World War II. You might be thinking, jeez, Pria, you get Cole’s radical, subversive film column and you review possibly the most cut-and-dry early 2000 war TV show, one that was literally directed by the king of mainstream cinema, Steven Spielberg?
Hear me out. Watching "Band of Brothers," in today’s media cycle, is in fact both radical, subversive, and yeah, I’ll say it: political resistance! The thing about "Band of Brothers" is that it is literally ONLY about World War II and ONLY about a specific, isolated group of paratroopers who don’t even fight in like, the major battles, they’re just literally clearing random roads and fields in France so that other war movies like Saving Private Ryan can happen in the background. But the very fact that the show is so narrow in its focus is what allows it to be broad in its detail.
I’m writing this review assuming that you, the reader, are like me — a coddled, art-adjacent young adult raised on a steady stream of A24 and Cr*ter*on with a healthy dose of Netflix Originals in the mix. I know some people grow up watching plenty of action and war movies, but personally, I was more of the Merchant-Ivory, Soft-Lighting, Women-Bickering, Spanish-Melodrama and Jane-Austen-Adaptations school of TV-watching. Perhaps if you’re a dyed-in-the-wool War-Movie freak my personal opinions on this TV show seem both ill-informed and overdramatic. But I’ll bravely share them anyway!
This show is PHENOMENAL. And not because of plot, or because it’s colorful and viscerally engaging (it’s possibly the closest thing to an anti-euphoria out there), but god, it’s just so chock-full of WAR. I don’t know about you guys but personally I don’t really think about World War II that often because I'm, you know, worried about World War III and also just getting along with the small worries of my day-to-day life. 
But there’s something about being confronted with the brutal reality of War with a capital “w” that really shook me out of my COVID haze and dropped me right on the shores of the Atlantic Theater. "Band of Brothers" is not really super funny, there’s no real main character — all the characters you start to care about get shot or bombed pretty quickly — and there isn’t much of a plot to speak of other than like, men doing War and Waiting to do War … but there’s something about this show that I can’t put my finger on that makes it compulsively watchable.
This is me speaking from a place of privilege, but personally I’ve been raised in a time in the media where I feel as though I am Oppressively Represented. I can turn on any Netflix-Amazon-Disney+ Original from the Streaming Industrial Complex and see the trials and tribulations of me and my peers, in all our LGBTQ+ glory. This is a controversial assessment, as I am very aware that representation in the media could be a lot stronger, but in my personal opinion I find there is a plethora of shows about teenagers and young adults dealing with both the small challenges of life as well as the big ones like drugs and sex and polyamory and secondary education etc. etc. (see: "Euphoria"). TV has always been obsessed with teens, and teens have always been obsessed with TV.
I don’t think I’ve ever seen a show like this, where it’s literally only white men wrestling and attacking one another and shooting guns and running up hills and stuff and just guys being dudes. I know this sentence is basically a description of all media that was ever produced up until about five years ago, but somehow I never managed to really sit down and connect with a movie about a group of sweaty, ragged, verge-of-death white men until my early twenties. I don’t think I’m really selling this show well but I promise you it’s good.
I guess the biggest thing I love about this show is just how intense it is and how life-or-death the stakes are. It both feels remote from me, due to the fact that I am (if you can believe it!) not a soldier and not at war, while also feeling very close to home, because you really get to see the way that regular men react to situations of extreme pressure and conflict. There’s the run-of-the-mill military-mandated heroism and glorification of violence, or course, but what I found unexpected was the level of tenderness, care and vulnerability also present across all these characters. The characters in "Band of Brothers" — while I can’t remember any of their names since as I mentioned they’re all white men and they’re all wearing the same outfit — still feel remarkably human and painfully close. I spent most of the first couple of episodes panicking that my younger brother would get drafted someday, since I couldn’t help but see his face in the faces of all these men.
There’s a reason it feels so real — it is! All the characters and events were meticulously researched and are nearly entirely based on real paratrooper’s experiences. And these men are interviewed at the beginning of every episode, which just drives home the fact that all of this ACTUALLY HAPPENED.
Still not sold on this ten-hour mini-series? Ease yourself into the madness with the hornier cousin of "Band of Brothers", "the Pacific," another ten-hour miniseries focusing on the Pacific Theater during World War Two. Rami Malek’s in a couple of episodes, and if that’s not enough, he’s also shirtless. 
Watching "Band of Brothers" in the year 2022 is a radical and subversive act simply due to the fact that it is such a traditional show. Like it’s straight up about history and war and not much else, and I’m realizing that’s really all you need! As much as I love the contemporary television trends towards $3 million production design and relentlessly aesthetically-pleasing lighting design, sometimes it’s nice to just watch guys get shot in the ugliest parts of Europe you can imagine. It drives home the reality and horror of warfare, which is not something I think about too often. I found it a little harder to wallow in my COVID self-pity after watching people die for an hour every night. And if you’ve read this far in this article and you’re asking yourself, is this article satire? At this point I could not tell you.
I know for a fact that this shift in perspective is entirely temporary, as I have probably already complained to everyone around me about four to five menial annoyances within the time it took to type up this article. But it’s still a nice shift to experience, even if only for the ten-hour runtime of the show. Or perhaps, maybe all I’ve learned is that I need to stop exclusively watching vaseline-lensed fuzzy-grain teen dramas and queue up some "Dunkirk" from time to time.

Yin Raquino is a phenomenally talented artist, whose work spans writing, visuals, and performance — the last of which they study in the Acting Program at Carnegie Mellon’s School of Drama. 
They gracefully and astutely answered our questions and provided some examples of their work for our issue this week. Their brilliant intellect and all-encompassing love is clear across their answers, and we hope you gain peace and insight from reading about their work, artistic process and inspirations: 
Name, pronouns, what kind of art do you do?
My name is Yin Raquino, I use they/them pronouns.
I think my art is based on self-exploration and who we are as romanticists - without the ego. One of my main themes is dismantling the self to return to the self, so I find what I do to be very spiritual — spiritually invigorating art. I love love, and so I lead with that objective as well. To be loved and to be in love, that’s a driving force in what I do and I care about it a lot.
Where are you from, geographically and emotionally?
I am from San Diego, California, but I have a very strong tether to the Philippines, because of my family there and my ancestry — my identity. I feel a beautiful and strong tie to the ocean, and water, and the moon because my mom is a Cancer. So every time I look at the moon, I just remember that cosmically, that’s also my shelter, and a safe haven. I think it’s very symbolic and beautiful that when I look up, I’m reminded that we all share the same sky. 
Emotionally, I’m from a very nonlinear place that is accompanied most by empathy and love and forgiveness and gentleness, but also, ruggedness and roughness. I really hope that that makes sense — but one of the biggest lessons I’ve learned for myself in the past how many months was, nothing is ever linear. It just goes to show in the way we flow with emotions and with energy, it’s not supposed to be possible in the sense that we get to put it in whatever way we want — the way that our bodies are able to absorb and fathom all these complex emotions at once — that’s where I’m from. And I don’t think there’s a name to it. I don’t think I should try to force one upon it, because I can still recognize something without confining it into a label.
How did you begin your artistic journey? How old were you?
I think I always knew that I wanted to pursue something artistic. As a kid, I have always been very into memorizing shows and scripts and punchlines, and I never really thought much of it other than I really enjoyed it. And I drew — I was very passionate about visual art when I was younger. And I had a few inspirations at the time that would teach me how to draw, but it wasn’t necessarily “how can I find a way to find my own style of sketching and drawing”, but they taught me how to draw in their way — and that was an interesting stepping stool because that’s what first introduced me into like, the idea that there is some sort of structure to art that others are gonna want you to follow because that works best for them but they don’t see, at least not in that moment, that that’s not how it works for everyone? 
Of course, as a five-year-old, I didn’t understand that. I thought that by pursuing … It was more egotistical if anything. It fed my ego because I thought that if I could make something so spectacular with nothing but a pen and paper — what else could I do? It was magic.
And I don’t know why I ever stopped, but I think it was good for me, too, solely because I wasn’t creating “my art” — I was creating art but not for the purpose of “what can I discover from this process” or “what does this tell me” — it was a mockery, maybe … I’m still figuring that out! But, then I began to write.
... I think I began writing in fourth grade? So nine, or ten, or eleven — around that age. I was approaching the very awkward and enlightening tween years. But that’s when I realized the impact of words. And how the degree of it [sic] can alter depending on which ones you pair with which. And recognizing too that, to be able to do that adequately, or poetically, that’s a superpower too. Because it evokes something within people and maybe that was the first time I could clock in that I had the power to do that. Um and I used to keep a book of story ideas that I would have and I’d make it a goal to think of like three to five each day just for the sake of making some. I think I got a little too meticulous in the later parts of it because I was like — well what else can I do? I was forcing creation and we all know that the repercussions of doing it on our bodies tend to be a lot.
And then skipping around — one of my best friends, Gianna Patterson, she saw this in me, and she brought up the idea of going to a performing arts middle school. And I had never done anything to that caliber before, in terms of taking risks. So we decided to go together.
And at the time they didn’t have creative writing as a major — but they did have theatre. And by that time I was twelve. And I remember my love for it coming gradually. Because my original intention to take the class was me being fed up with the fact that I was so shy. And now it’s become something that is just one of the best things that we can do for ourselves and for others. Learning how to understand other people, and assess and forgive. The choice to learn to learn that you have a choice. 
What does your personal artistic process look like?
My personal artistic process is beautifully all over the place. Of course, I start off with my writing, and again love letters is a big thing for me — I like to think that the way that I dive deep into my characters is asking them, and discovering their love languages, because even with someone who seems to possess all the great evils, we all want to experience love, it’s something that we all crave and fight for, and start wars for, so I lead with that. I think about who they love, who they have loved, who they want to love, how they love themselves, the significance of love in their life, the presence of it or the lack thereof. And I just take notes, and try to sketch. I make magazine collages with color themes or specific phrasings, and I just allow the words and the images and the colors to take me, which is one thing I love about collages so much, is that they tell me what to do. And I just listen to them, and I listen to they way they want to be cut, and I honor that. And I listen to the images that need to be put in the center, and the images that need to be hidden or tucked in, because they’re not ready yet. And I can sense words floating in my head and in the air, and whichever ones need the most light in that moment — I write it down. 
I feel like my artistic process changes from time to time though, as I continue to learn more about myself, and who I am as a person and how that translates into my artistry, but also how that translates into me being a lover and someone who wants to experience connection so deeply. It’s like a healing process too, I feel, like I mentioned earlier — my artistry is very spiritual to me, and I made the discovery not long ago: how can I make it spiritual? How can I make the decision to better myself in this moment with this material I have right now? What does this lesson teach me?
What are some projects you are working on right now that you are proud and excited about?
I’m very happy to say that I’m currently on my sixth journal and it’s been a whirlwind! I’m just so lucky that I have a place to put all my musings, no matter their weight, because I trust that my journal will hold them. And I have a lot of admiration for the object that holds my heart, ever so delicately. I plan to write more songs, I plan to — is cooking a project?
What’s the best advice you’ve been given?
If I could make a book out of all the advice my mentor has given me, it would be the best seller for years, and years, and years. She is the wisest person I have ever met, and I can’t seem to put my finger on to one, but this one came up when I was looking at all my previous works. And you will see it on the graduation cap piece — I hope that I quoted it correctly — but I remember that at the end of my senior years, she told me that the lives that we get to touch, and the lives that we get to love, that is the winning. I forgot about that. And I think that this quote appeared to me at a very great time in my life, because I am going through a lot of lessons, and these lessons are very hard, and visceral, that I forget that in the end I am winning because I have these experiences. I am grateful to do so in a place that will hold me when I fall. 
How does your community inspire you?
I have a lot of different communities, and sometimes I have trouble trying to combine them when maybe they shouldn’t be combined — maybe they’re beautiful enough in their own little spaces. But my communities inspire me in a sense to become a better friend. To learn how to be a better person when comforting someone, or how to be a better or helpful presence, while also learning how to balance that with myself. Overcompensating and overexerting my energy for the sake of someone else’s peace is not taking care of either side. They inspire me to continue to pursue balance, and to choose myself and to choose my work and to choose peace, even though the road to peace can be very bumpy and rough … but it’s the little dent that reminds us of what we’ve gone through to land at our divine destination. I have multiple places, and there’s a place within myself and that compassion and support is all around me, and within me. They inspire me to love wholeheartedly. And I think that’s one of the best lessons that anyone can receive — the reminder that their love didn’t go to waste.
What made you decide to pursue your art at Carnegie Mellon?
There was this calling to Carnegie, for me. I don’t know how else to explain it. It’s just as simple as that. I just knew that by picking this institution, I’d also be picking myself. That’s a hard thing to do. And I knew that the journey was going to be difficult, but again, it’s just the fact that this difficulty can also be seen as an opportunity. That’s my reasoning. I think that we deserve the chance to just say that it felt right and just leave it there. Everything we experience after will align and make sense.
I just knew that the way my art would flourish here would — something about the way that my art would flourish here captivated me. And I pursued it.
What's the best part of being an artist right here (CMU, Pittsburgh, the world) and right now?
Right now, I am in a very intense state of emotional contemplation, and physical contemplation too, so I think the best part about an artist, for me, is that this is a safe place where I don’t have to mold my sadness into anything else, and I can give it free reign, and there’s permission for it to unapologetically fester and spoil, and that, in art, that’s regarded as something beautiful — not that it never reached that capacity of beauty before, but creating things from situations that hold a lot of weight has been enlightening to say the least. There’s just something so sacred about continuing to get to know myself, and the experience through a very in-depth and emotional process of creation, and I think that’s the best part of being an artist for me — I think I’m the most in tune with myself that I’ve ever been. And I think that alone creates great art.

Beginning on Jan. 22, a convoy of Canadian vehicles, dubbed the “Freedom Convoy” by its organizers, started all across Canada heading for the capital city of Ottawa. After nearly a month of protests, arrests are starting to be made and vehicles that blocking the streets of Ottawa towed. Arrests beginning on Feb. 17 included three of the movement's leaders, according to a statement released by Freedom Convoy 2022, one of the main organizations leading this protest.
The demonstration was originally an effort to end the cross-border vaccine mandates in Canada. This followed the Canadian government’s announcement that unvaccinated Canadian truckers crossing the border between the U.S. and Canada had to quarantine upon their return. Not long after, the U.S. required truck drivers to show proof of vaccination upon entry starting Jan. 22. According to the Canadian Trucking Association, these requirements could affect between 28,000 and 38,000 truck drivers across the two nations.
Once arriving in Ottawa, protesters parked their vehicles on the streets, many adorned with Canadian flags. At times, the city was filled with the sounds of protesters honking their horns in the streets. 
On Feb. 16, the Ottawa City Council held a meeting to discuss how to disperse the protestos' blockade of vehicles. Council member Catherine McKenny joined the meeting from the streets, asking what the plan was for residents of Ottawa who lived in areas with protesters. In the video, the street is filled with parked cars blocking street access. 
Freedom Convoy had also set up speakers for demonstrators in Ottawa. Events were canceled on the evening of Feb. 19 due to police checkpoints, though a video post on Freedom Convoy’s Twitter showed a large gathering of protesters still gathered around 6:30 p.m.
Throughout the protest, the Ottawa Police Department has been releasing updates on arrests, vehicle towings, and messages to protesters. Media outlets have been taking to Twitter to post updates, including Fox News correspondent Sara Carter, who in a since-deleted tweet stated that a woman had been trampled by a Canadian horse patrol and later died at a hospital. The Ottawa Police refuted the claim, saying that no one had been seriously injured or died due to police actions. Carter later issued an apology that her sources on the ground were mistaken and someone with a heart condition was taken to a hospital.
A tweet by the Ottawa Police department on Feb. 20 reported 191 arrests and 57 towed vehicles. Of those arrested, 103 were charged, mostly with mischief and obstruction. 
The convoy also inspired some to block border crossing between the U.S. and Canada. The border crossing between Alberta and Montana was blocked by peaceful protesters against Canadian COVID policies for more than two weeks. Traffic began moving again on Feb. 15.
Arrests were made at the crossing, including four men charged with plotting to murder Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers. On Feb. 7, movement across the border between Ontario and Michigan came to a halt following protests. Movement across Ambassador Bridge did not resume until Feb. 13 following 42 arrests and 37 vehicle seizures.
The Freedom Convoy has inspired others to hold similar protests to COVID-19 vaccination mandates. According to the website for “The People’s Convoy,” there will be a convoy leaving from Adelanto Stadium in Southern California. The organization’s website includes the planned route and a link to donate to those involved. They claim that $130,000 has been donated towards their efforts as of Feb. 19.
According to a press release from the organization, for 11 days they will travel to Washington, D.C., and will disperse once they arrive on March 5, in an agreement with local D.C. authorities. The People’s Convoy claims to be a “non-partisan effort supported by a cross-cultural and multi-faith consortium.” They state that Robert Kennedy Jr.’s Children’s Health Defense TV will be following them with live updates. The Children’s Health Defense has been known to spread anti-vaccination rhetoric and has made calls to end COVID-19-related mandates. Despite The People’s Convoy claiming to be a non-partisan effort, many of the organizations that back them, such as The Unity Project and The America Project, support conservative talking points.
The American Trucker Freedom Fund shares a similar goal to The People’s Convoy, but seemingly takes a more partisan stance. This organization is funded by the Great American Patriot Project, who “support Vetted Patriot Candidates to run for State and Federal Office under the Republican ticket.” The American Trucker Freedom Fund lists several routes on their website, with start dates ranging from March 1 to March 6. Most of their routes end at Washington, D.C.

On Feb. 11, first-year student Kyle Hynes’ world shrunk to the size of a Fairfax apartment. He woke up to a COVID-positive PCR notification and moved into Isolation and Quarantine (IQ) Housing by mid-afternoon. 
After a month of winter break, Carnegie Mellon students returned to Pittsburgh with COVID in tow. Community cases rose by over 500% between December and January, totalling 942 positive individuals. More than 8% of students, both on and off campus, tested positive for the coronavirus in January. 
Students living on campus who test positive must move into Isolation and Quarantine (IQ) Housing. Between Feb. 16 and Feb. 18, the Carnegie Mellon data showed that IQ Housing capacity dropped from 68% to 40%. However, the same number of beds (116), were reported to be available on both days.
In an email to The Tartan, Interim Managing Director of Communications Shilpa Bakre said that Margaret Morrison #101 and Shirley Apartments are being used for IQ Housing. “Should more space be needed to meet demand, contingency plans will be implemented,” she wrote. University data suggests that 60% of IQ Housing is available, but Fairfax Apartments is also being used. Some of the building’s residents (who do not have COVID) said they were not informed of this policy. One resident speculated that, with so few apartments available, COVID-positive students are likely interspersed on the same floor as regular tenants. 
Students can expect to find snacks, toiletries, and “an activities book with crayons or colored pencils in your room upon arrival,” according to the IQ Housing page. In an interview with The Tartan, first-year student Eric Hernandez specifically noted his appreciation for the "adult activities workbook that included word searches and crosswords... It was pretty cool." 
In addition to the crafts, Hynes was greeted with frozen meals supplemented by “fresh-ish food throughout” his stay. Seven days with no distractions beyond a roommate, a window, and whatever can be found on the internet. The lack of structure each day made it difficult for Hernandez to stay on top of his work. “My professors have been nothing but accommodating,” Hynes explained to The Tartan. But the opportunity to get ahead on coursework felt impossible. Instead, he kept pace with his classes and spent his free time with video games, music, and sleep. 
"Out of 10," Hernandez wrote to The Tartan, "I would rate my experience with CMU Quarantine Housing a 4.5-5." He appreciated the "spacious apartment, which was a nice upgrade from the small single" he was assigned, "plenty of snack and drinks... and a relatively quiet building." These benefits weigh against the challenges of social isolation and mediocre meals. "I also didn't appreciate how the dining menu always offered a bagel for breakfast and I... did not receive a single bagel until my fifth day there." Not a single bagel. 
Hynes understands the stringent COVID-19 mitigation efforts made by the university. Plus, he wrote, “While it would be nice to be able to go for a walk or to have the bagels come with cream cheese, I could certainly imagine a worse quarantine arrangement.” As loneliness and boredom push the second hand forward, Hynes watches the clock. “I'm excited for the minute after midnight Saturday morning, when I can finally leave this place behind.” 
Once Hernandez had settled in to IQ Housing, no checked whether he stayed in his room. "The quarantine guidelines," which mandate that students do not leave their apartment, "would be easy for someone to sidestep," Hernandez explained. Yet he "appreciate[d] the trust and lack of security measures... [which] would have made an already... uncomfortable situation even more miserable."
One in every five students eligible for a third dose have not received one, despite the university-wide booster mandate. Students were required to submit documentation of the third shot by Feb. 16. Carnegie Mellon will “follow up directly with those who have not yet uploaded their documentation,” Bakre wrote. Faculty and staff eligible for the third dose have reported booster rates of 91% and 85%, respectively. 
The University has moved from a modified to transitional status on campus, allowing classes to be delivered in person rather than over Zoom. As of Jan. 31, this also shortened the isolation period for COVID-positive students from ten days to seven.
Carnegie Mellon has held three vaccine clinics since January, according to Bakre. They were all fully booked. Future clinics will be held on Feb. 25, March 15, March 30, and April 13. 
To fortify pandemic safety efforts, Carnegie Mellon introduced KN95 vending machines in the University Center (UC), Mellon Institute, Baker Hall, and Purnell Center for the Arts. The pilot project has also begun to provide rapid tests. The UC machine was empty on Feb. 20.

I have always been a words girl. From writing them, to reading them, to over-analyzing them, to criticizing them, to yelling them, words are just amazing. Growing up, my mom would spend Sunday mornings nestled on our worn-out leather couch, New York Times Magazine in one hand and fresh coffee in the other, doing the Sunday crossword. I would hover around the coffee table contributing what little clues I knew and eagerly filling the spaces in with messy blue pen. Words were more to me than just a means to an end, they were a way to connect with the people I loved most dearly.
But when I left home for Carnegie Mellon, I was swept up by classes, by friends, by life. My parents understood, but I could tell from the missed calls and my 2 a.m. replies to 3 p.m. texts that the distance was hitting them hard. I felt like a terrible daughter whisked away to a far city only to seemingly forget her loved ones. So, this semester, I made a pact with myself: be a better daughter. Unbeknownst to me, the first step was a little game called "Wordle."
Based on crossword puzzles like the ones I grew up on, Wordle has taken the internet by storm. The game is set up in a five by six grid where players have six chances to guess the five-letter word of the day. When a player guesses the correct letter in the correct spot, the square turns green. Meanwhile, a correct letter in the wrong spot appears yellow. Letters that are not in the word appear gray. The game is a puzzling combination of guessing, process of elimination (as the alphabet only has 26 letters), and word-ly knowledge. 
However, the key feature of Wordle that makes it so popular is the "share" function. Clicking the share button to send to friends, family, or post on social media makes the game a pillar of community and competition. I was introduced to the game by a fellow crossword enthusiast here at Carnegie Mellon, sending our scores back and forth each day. Soon enough though, my parents caught on, and we began sharing our Wordles every day. Our family group chat filled up with green, yellow, and gray squares. I frequently send mine at 2 a.m., followed by my early-riser father at 6 a.m., and then my mother and little sister at more reasonable hours of the day. Going from contacting my family once a week to seeing their Wordle scores and commentary every night, I feel closer to them than I ever have at Carnegie Mellon. Wordle has allowed my family’s tumultuous schedules to coincide once a day with words of encouragement, exasperation, and of course the occasional trash talk. 
At its core, Wordle is a game of love. The creator, Josh Wardle, a Brooklyn software engineer, developed it because his partner — like my family and I — loves word games. A wordy guy at heart, Wardle named it as a pun of his last name. Slowly but surely, Wardle shared the love and Wordle grew out of his family’s WhatsApp group chat to the rest of the world, filtering through Twitter, news articles, all the way into my family group chat. The chat where a daughter whisked away to a far city could stay connected with her family once more. So, um, thanks Josh. I owe you one.

The social and cultural impact of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Emmy-sweeping musical is indisputable. “Hamilton'' revitalized the musical theater industry, drawing immense financial success on multiple continents. Miranda’s revolutionary idea to portray the rise of America’s first Treasury Secretary via a hip-hop musical transcended all boundaries pertaining to age, imbuing a new generation with interest in this Founding Father’s extraordinary life. The musical sent shockwaves across Broadway, but that was in August 2015. 
Why, then, in 2022, does Miranda’s magnum opus still act as such a cultural cornerstone? Why does Hamilton defy the norm of popular culture which typically fades into obscurity a decade on? 
Perhaps Hamilton’s deep political undertones allow the musical to reflect the socio-political issues that plague modern America, constantly renewing interest as the years go on. The original cast consisted of mainly actors of color, who almost always played white historical figures. This decision had widespread ramifications for the musical, but its impact can be distilled into two clear ideas. First, the score was generally enhanced, as most actors had expertise relating to hip-hop in addition to acting. Second, and more importantly, the entire musical instantly transformed a middle-school history lesson to a contemporary, richly-layered text representative of modern America. Diverse actors were placed center stage, allowing a huge, untapped audience to resonate with an industry that used to be, and arguably is still, highly homogenous. 
However, the fingerprints of Miranda’s liberal centrism throughout the text, coupled with the show’s diverse cast representing white characters, has drawn heavy fire from critics across the political spectrum. While conservative critics decry “Hamilton” as revisionist and inaccurate, the leftist critique is that its diverse cast may reduce its inherent capacity to actually voice the role people of color played during the founding of the nation. Rutgers professor Lyra D. Monteiro, in a Medium 2019 post, argued that, “while the play is praised for its racially adventurous casting, it in fact uses the talents, bodies, and voices of black artists to mask an erasure of people of color from the actual story of the American Revolution.” This critique is further exacerbated by the musical’s refusal to address its heroes’ relationship to slavery. This discourse, of course, comes at an especially turbulent time for race in America, as the nation reckons with systematic violence.
While the musical’s seemingly permanent relevance may be due to the subject matter, it is also difficult to refute the ingenious marketing and platform capitalization the team behind “Hamilton” conducted. Immense amounts of social media interaction were generated by the original cast, from its appearance on John Krasinski’s "Some Good News" segment (where the median audience age was 12), or the clever distillation of a core thematic tenet of the text — “Immigrants, we get the job done!” — to #getthejobdone. "Hamilton" shatters the notion that marketing for musicals is limited to enormous Broadway billboards, and instead appeals to the youth using channels that most leave untapped. Furthermore, as tickets sold out, the show runners introduced a ticket lottery, allowing consumers to obtain discounted prices two-and-a-half hours before the show. While the chances of winning were similar to that of the actual lottery, its clever name  “Ham4Ham” (which means a Hamilton bill ($10) for a “Hamilton” ticket) and heavy social media circulation helped the campaign take off. This was supplemented by a "Hamilton" app, released in 2017, provided a plethora of features, including augmented reality, educational modules, and interactive karaoke tracks. These intense campaigns eventually paid dividends, with over $650 million grossed, and ran in cities like Chicago, London, Hamburg, Sydney, and New York.
The wild success of "Hamilton" can be attributed to a powerful marketing and campaign as well as a critically acclaimed script. However, whether its flaws will age gracefully, against a backdrop national tensions, is yet to be determined. 
Until then, the show is back in Pittsburgh: “Hamilton” opens on Feb. 22 at the Benedum Center.

Thousands of truck drivers and their respective allies have staked out along the U.S.-Canada border. Miles of trucks have been parked in even, impenetrable lines through the heart of Ottawa. The central tenet of the movement: vaccine mandates steal our freedom. 
On the content front: stay in your lane, Canada. Americans have COVID-denial down pat. Who needs a vaccine when we have Ivermectin? While the cause has us choking back bile, the self-described “Freedom Convoy” does have tact. 
Organizers are strategically positioned in hotel rooms overlooking the scene. They are using peaceful protest to defend their idea of freedom. Not a single bull-horned man has draped himself across a Parliamentary chair. Not a single noose in sight. Sure, there was the occasional murder threat, but what peaceful protest is entirely devoid of radicals? The movement may be misguided, but the strategy? The Tartan staff is taking notes. 
Arrests made to diffuse the motor blockade are charging protestors with obstruction and, much more importantly, mischief. Stay naughty, Canada! Protesting national health is insane, sure. But with an insurrection barely a year behind us, who are Americans to call out Canada?
One of our writers did not hesitate to unleash a spat of anti-Canada rhetoric. “It’s an evil country with an evil soul,” was one of his choice descriptors. The country, responsible for myriad violations against Indigenous communities, is led by a prime minister who has donned blackface too many times to count. But as mentioned before, as Americans our ability to judge is in the basement’s basement. Trudeau had to apologize for his racist past, but Trump — no. We’re not getting into it. Fill in the sentence in any way that feels right to you, or skip right over it and prioritize your mental health. We support you, besties. 
One thing the Freedom Convoy has excelled at is spreading their message, but maybe a little too loudly. Their anti-mandate rhetoric is easy to grasp: mask and vaccine mandates bad, freedom good. What may not be as easy to grasp is why they have spent countless hours honking their horns. They just want to be seen and make sure you don't go to sleep until the all restrictions have been lifted. 
The Freedom Convoy was effective at spreading its message through its travels. But another group, led by truckers in British Columbia, was part of a convoy protesting icy and dangerous road conditions. This rally, organized by the West Coast Trucking Association (WCTA), started in Surrey, BC, and made its way to Vancouver on Jan. 22. Unfortunately for them, their departure coincided with the Freedom Convoy. 
WCTA’s message was almost completely ignored since it wasn’t nearly as controversial as the Freedom Convoy’s. Who cares about the dangerous driving conditions when there are thousands of Canadians acting like they live in America? A shortage of truck drivers is currently one of the main problems within the North American supply chain. Unsafe road conditions are just another reason for truckers to leave the profession.
The methods used by WCTA were much tamer in comparison to their Freedom Convoy counterpart. Those in the WCTA convoy were asked to respect the road rules, stay clear of intersections, and obey right of ways. Honking was out of the question. The group still participated in its convoy, as shown by a video posted by WCTA. Almost a week after the convoy, WCTA also assembled representatives from the Ministry of Transportation of British Columbia, and the British Columbia Road Builder and Heavy Construction Association to discuss dangerous roads. This is a clear example of success from a well-organized protest.
No matter how crude the Freedom Convoy was in its fight to get COVID-related mandates removed, other groups are taking notes. Over the next few weeks, the self-described "nonpartisan" People's Convoy will be launching their pilgrimage across the nation from sunny California to the swamp of Washington, D.C. The People's Convoy does get points for intersectionality. They describe their movement as an “effort supported by a cross-cultural and multi-faith consortium.” The convoy may not follow through on this mission, but their idealistic framework is keeping us hopeful.

Why is Presidents Day even a holiday? Why specifically celebrate on Feb. 21? Which president is being celebrated? When was it created? Why was it created? What is the point? Well, Presidents Day wasn’t always Presidents Day. At first, it was a holiday created in 1879 that commemorated George Washington’s birthday, Feb. 22, as a national holiday. But the issue was that there were other influential presidents who had birthdays in the same time period. For example, Abraham Lincoln’s birthday was Feb. 12. So, states started making Feb. 22 into a more generalized holiday, with some variations of it called Presidents Day. 
This changed in 1971, when the Uniform Monday Holiday Act — passed in 1968 — went into effect. It was an effort by Congress to create more three-day weekends for federal employees during the year, which President Lyndon B. Johnson wrote in his statement when he signed the bill in 1968. These federal holidays included the creation of Columbus Day on the second Monday in October, moving Memorial Day from May 30 to the last Monday of May, and establishing Presidents Day on the third Monday of February instead of Feb. 22. Veteran’s Day was also changed to the fourth Monday of October for a little bit so that October could have two three-day weekends, but it was changed back to the original November 11th date in 1978. 
Creating more federal holidays also was meant to have a positive impact on both Americans and the private sector. President Johnson hoped that more long weekends would allow families to spend more time with each other, travel more, and consume more. Additionally, he hoped moving holidays to Mondays would spare the private sector the logistical troubles of midweek holidays. The federal holiday bill was a small improvement meant to tap into a deeper fundamental issue: the length of the average American’s work week. 
In 1880, when American labor movements, populists, and farmer’s movements started gaining momentum, the average American workday was almost 10 hours. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, those hours tended to be longer. With increases in productivity and increased consumption, many workers demanded 8-hour days. Their wish was granted during the Great Depression. The Fair Labor Standards Act was passed in 1938 and established 40-hour work weeks, overtime pay, and a minimum wage. Naturally, many people had complaints, which President Roosevelt responded to with one of the most honest statements ever spoken by an American president: 
“Do not let any calamity-howling executive with an income of $1,000 a day, who has been turning his employees over to the Government relief rolls in order to preserve his company's undistributed reserves, tell you — using his stockholders' money to pay the postage for his personal opinions — that a wage of $11 a week is going to have a disastrous effect on all American industry.”
This perfectly taps into the heart of the issue that both the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Uniform Monday Holiday Act tried to address. Expansion and innovation are rooted in exploitation of labor, and the benefits of the resulting progress were hoarded by rent-seeking elites maximizing their profit. Demands for fair working conditions, more time off for leisure, living wages, and livable conditions were those workers asking for the benefits of the progress to apply to them. It was not sensible or sustainable for the capitalists to make the vast majority of the profit while laborers would see their wages stagnate or get cut during economic crises. 
In economics, one of the fundamental conflicts that receives a lot of attention is the tradeoff between work and leisure. This is a basic model that many have likely seen in an introductory microeconomics course. There is a budget, there are a limited number of hours, and then workers get to split their time between work and leisure based on the budget. But, this isn’t really how things work, in reality. Actually, most people don’t really get to pick how many hours they work. There’s a set number of hours people have to work in the week which their company dictates. There is supposed to be a ceiling on the number of hours, but most Americans are working more than 40 hours a week even in the modern economy. 
The model also doesn’t account for the growth in productivity and efficiency that gets brought about by technological advances. Before technology advanced, long work days were common because that’s what was needed. But, with new innovation and more efficient methods of production, long work days were no longer necessary. Henry Ford transitioned his company to a 40 hour work week from 48, and it ended up increasing productivity. It turns out giving workers a break rather than making them do more work than they needed to do made them better at their jobs while giving them more to do with their lives other than work. The federal holiday bill inadvertently is an acknowledgement of this fact. 
In our current structure, 40 hour work days are not productive. In my experience, at least five to ten hours of my week was just a waste because I didn’t have anything to do, and many other workers have this experience too. In one survey, 64% of employees visited non-work related sites at work every day, many of them for hours at a time. The three most cited reasons for the “time waste” at work were that people didn’t feel challenged, they worked too many hours, or the company didn’t give them enough incentive to work harder. Stagnating wages and rising costs of living only exacerbate these issues. There are some pushing for four day work weeks to address the labor productivity issue, similar to what is implemented in some European countries.  
I can’t help but return to the simple, work-leisure tradeoff model. The answer to the labor issue is in one detail of the model: It should be the worker’s choice how they divide their time. Putting a ceiling on the amount of hours worked or having guaranteed holidays and vacation time is good, but it isn’t enough. The relationship between worker and company needs to be redefined for what we have now, and allowing employees flexibility in their hours will certainly do more to address the issues affecting millions of Americans than giving them a seemingly random day off on the third Monday of February meant to commemorate dead presidents.
