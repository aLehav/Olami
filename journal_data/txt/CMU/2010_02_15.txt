The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team was finally able to break a 14-game losing streak and take home their first University Athletic Association (UAA) victory. This weekend the Tartans hosted UAA opponents Emory University and the University of Rochester.
On Friday night, the Tartans took on the Emory Eagles, but fell 71–77 in the final minutes. With numerous lead changes in the first half, the teams battled for control of the game. The Eagles came out to a strong start, leading the Tartans 13–8 four minutes into the half, but the next four minutes belonged to the Tartans as they scored 11 unanswered points. With 9:08 remaining in the half, Carnegie Mellon took a 26–18 lead with junior Shane Rife scoring 10 of the 18 points. The Tartans’ lead did not last for long as Emory took control, outscoring the Tartans 24–8 during the last nine minutes to take a 42–34 lead heading into the half.
The Tartans came out of the break fired up, going on a 16–4 run to get within one point of the Eagles. The 53–52 score was as close as the Tartans’ would come as Emory slowly began to pull away. Back-to-back three-pointers for the Eagles kicked off their run as they went on to end the game 71–77.
Senior Jack Anderson led the Tartan’s offense to score 21 points, followed by Rife and junior Matt Pettit, who added 17 and 16 points, respectively. Pettit recorded his seventh double-double of the season, pulling in a game-high 11 rebounds.
On Sunday, the Tartans pulled out their first UAA victory defeating Rochester 73–64. The first half was a battle for the upper hand as neither team took more than a four-point lead during the first 20 minutes of play. Going into the break, the Yellowjackets held a 31–33 lead over the Tartans. A three-pointer by Anderson kicked off the second half and gave the Tartans the boost they needed to come away with the victory. With 15:47 to go in the half, the Yellowjackets took a 40–42 lead, but it was the last lead they would have for the rest of the game. The Tartans pulled away from Rochester, shooting 47.8 percent from the field and 72.7 percent from the line.
Anderson once again led the Tartans with 16 points ,followed by Rife with 14 and sophomore John Duhring with 13.
“It was great to finally break this streak and win our first UAA game,” Anderson said. “We’ve put a lot of work into this season and it’s about time that we execute.”
The Tartans are back in action next weekend as they head to the University of Chicago on Friday and Washington University in St. Louis on Sunday.

After an exciting win over Emory on Friday, the Tartans were not able to continue the momentum to defeat the University of Rochester on Sunday. First-year guard Brit Phillips said that the Tartans were looking to prove to “the remaining teams that [they] are not just going to roll over and hold up the white flag.” Yet on Sunday for the second time, Carnegie Mellon suffered a tough loss, 49–55, and moved to 9–13 overall and 2–9 in the University Athletic Association.
Rochester started the game strong, but the Tartans garnered a 10–2 run to tie the game at 15–15 with 9:15 to go in the first half. During the run, Carnegie Mellon went 4–4 from the floor, including a layup by first-year forward Emily Peel and a trey by Phillips.
The Tartans took a 24–21 lead after a string of three baskets. Sophomore guard Alison Aunkst hit a trey, which was followed by a fast-break layup by junior guard Jessica Buranovsky. Aunkst then scored again off an assist from Phillips. Carnegie Mellon claimed the lead 28–26 going into the halftime break.
However, Rochester’s defense kept the Tartans from scoring for seven minutes, and the Yellowjackets went on a 9–0 run to take a 37–46 lead with 8:35 left in the game. With two minutes to play, sophomore Jennifer Larsen cut Carnegie Mellon’s deficit to three with back-to-back baskets. Unfortunately, the Yellowjackets held on to the lead in the final seconds, as the Tartans missed four critical free throws.
Larsen led the Tartans in scoring with 17 points, and fifth-year senior Rachelle Roll scored nine points and pulled down 17 rebounds.
Despite the loss, Peel said the team is “always ready to play the next game. In order for the team to end this season strong, we have to take one game at a time and focus on beating [our opponents] and playing our best each game.”
Carnegie Mellon’s next game will be on the road at the University of Chicago on Friday.

Last Sunday, in what seemed to be a slightly rushed dual match, the men’s tennis team managed to overcome Division II’s Mercyhurst College 7–2. This is the third straight match the Tartans have won, and it puts them at a current record of 5–1. 
Right off the bat, the Tartans brought out their best games. Seniors James Muliawan and Niko Ljuboja and the team of senior Jon Spero and junior Bobby MacTaggart took out the Lakers’ first and third doubles teams 8–4. First-year Duke Miller and sophomore Jeremy King did not have the same luck, however, and fell 7–9 to put the Tartans at 2–1 heading into singles play.
A slight logistics problem left a very limited amount of court time for the match, forcing the Tartans to play out pro sets for the singles portion of play. MacTaggart played first singles and won 8–6. Miller played the next spot down in the lineup and impressively lost only a single game, taking the win 8–1. First-year Harsha Rao contributed another point for the Tartans at fourth singles, winning 8–5, while King redeemed himself from doubles with an 8–6 win over the Lakers’ fifth player, Juan Franco. Ljuboja, playing in the last singles spot, swept his opponent 8–0 to give the Tartans a decisive 7–2 win. 
Spero felt this win was an excellent marker of the team’s progress this season, especially with the ITA Indoor National Championships starting this week. “National Indoors for the men has been going on for about 10 years now, and this is the first time CMU has qualified. For me personally, next Friday will be the biggest match of my college career.” He added, “Not only is it our first trip to Indoors, but we get to play the number-one team in the country and defending national champions. We know we have a great shot to win. It’s a great opportunity for us, and everyone knows they need to bring their A game in all three matches.”
The Tartans will travel to Minnesota this Friday for the ITA Indoor Championships.

Despite a week-long setback due to the recent blizzard, the Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team hit the ground running in its first season match against Division II West Virginia Wesleyan College, wiping out the Bobcats 7–2. The Tartans moved to 4–1 overall with this win and are gearing up for the ITA Indoor National Championships this weekend.
The Tartans quickly took the lead against the Bobcats, going up 3–0 after a sweep from the doubles teams. The ITA doubles champions, the duo of seniors James Muliawan and Niko Ljuboja, added a point to the total at first doubles. Initially down 3–6, they rallied back to narrowly win 9–8 (7). The young team of first-year Duke Miller and sophomore Jeremy King knocked out their opponents 8–6 to take the second point. Completing the sweep at third doubles were juniors Alex Nemerov and Bobby MacTaggart, also winning 8–6.
“Niko and I had quite a scare in our doubles,” Muliawan said, “but since we’ve played together so much we were able to pull it out at the end. Indoors is coming up in a week, with very difficult teams, so this was a good warmup.”
“WVW is a ranked [Division II] team with good players in their whole lineup, so we were happy with a win,” senior Jon Spero observed. “We came out flat in doubles, which [assistant coach] Mike wasn’t happy with, but we raised our level when things got tight.”
The Tartans continued their momentum into the singles portion of the dual match, taking four of the six singles. MacTaggart and Nemerov dropped both their singles, but to very good opponents. 
Muliawan defeated his opponent in a battle 7–5, 6–4, after being down 2–5 in the first, while Spero outlasted his opponent 6–4, 6–4. First-year Harsha Rao also had a tough match, pulling out the first set 7–6 (1) but easily taking the second 6–2. Miller breezed through his match at number four singles, dropping only three games to win 6–2, 6–1.
“We know our strength is the bottom of the lineup, and this showed, as we won [third through sixth] singles and doubles,” Spero said. “We really needed this win to get us ready for Indoors. We have high expectations for ourselves.”
This season is the first time the Tartans have qualified for the ITA National Indoor Championship, which will be held this weekend at Gustavus Adolphus College in Minnesota.

The Tartans finished an exciting weekend of home games against Emory University and the University of Rochester. Carnegie Mellon topped Emory in overtime, 64–60, but fell to Rochester 49–55. The squad is now 9–13 overall and is 2–9 in the University Athletic Association (UAA).
On Friday, Emory hit the first two baskets of the game to take a five-point lead, but Carnegie Mellon answered with an 8–0 run to take an 8–5 lead. The remainder of the half stayed just as close, with both teams exchanging baskets. The Tartans held the lead at halftime, 27–26. First-year guard Brit Phillips clinched the Tartans’ first-half lead with two free throws.
Fifth-year senior forward Rachelle Roll opened the second half with a layup, but the rest of the Tartan offense could not match Emory’s, as the Eagles went on a 7–13 run. Emory held the lead until there were four minutes left in the game, when sophomore guard Alison Aunkst hit two free throws to help Carnegie Mellon take back the lead, 47–46. But Emory would not back down and went on a 7–3 run to take a four-point lead with 44 seconds left. Sophomore forward Jennifer Larsen scored a layup to put the Tartans within two points, and Phillips shot a buzzer- beater to put the game into extra minutes.
Emory hit the first basket in overtime, but Carnegie Mellon responded with a free throw by Larsen and back-to-back three-pointers by Aunkst. Emory tied the game at 60–60, but then fouled Roll on an offensive rebound. Roll sank a free throw to take back the lead. Junior guard Jessica Buranovsky and Phillips helped seal the Tartans’ 64–60 win with a fast-break layup and free throw, respectively.
Phillips tallied 14 points, Roll had 13, Larsen scored 11, and Buranovsky had 10. Roll topped her old school record of 20 rebounds by securing 22 in the game.
Results for the game against Rochester will be posted online later this week.
Carnegie Mellon’s next games will be on the road on Friday against the University of Chicago and Sunday at Washington University in St. Louis.

Despite the icy weather outside, the Carnegie Mellon women's tennis team began what is officially known as its spring season this past Saturday against Slippery Rock University. The No. 6 Tartans traveled to Wexford, Pa. and showed little signs of rust as they shut out their Division II opponents 9–0 in their first dual match since October. Their dual match record is now 3–0.
The Rock put up a good fight against the Tartans in doubles play, but the girls from Pittsburgh came away with the sweep, led by the ITA National Championship-qualifying duo of junior Ashley Herrick and sophomore Laura Chen. Herrick and Chen won their match, 8–6, while first-year Alex Tapak and junior Jennifer Chui also won 8–6 at number-two doubles. The duo of sophomore Courtney Chin and first-year Christina Brant finished out the sweep with an 8–5 win.
"This team was very tough," Herrick said. "I'm glad we came away with this win. The snow caused a lot of chaos with our practice schedule, so I was worried we were going into the match unprepared. I think this win against a D-II team definitely prepares us for nationals in a few weeks." 
Chen shared her partner's sentiments. "This was a good match for us to start our season with. Match play gives us a level of intensity that sometimes can't be replicated in practice." 
Slippery Rock senior Laura Handy gave Chen a run for her money at first singles, but Chen eventually came out on top, 6–7 (4), 6–1, 10–6. Chin followed that up by defeating the Rock's Sarah Lynch 6–3, 7–5. Tapak battled opponent Dunja Drmac and eventually came out with the hard-earned win, 7–6 (1), 7–6 (3).
"I was disappointed that I wasn't able to play as well as I hoped," Tapak said in reference to her two-hour win. "But after a couple of months without any matches, this was a very good way to kick off the season." 
At number-four singles, Chui came out with a 7–6 (4), 6–3 victory, and Tartan sophomore Cze-Ja Tam handled her opponent 6–3, 6–3. To round out singles play and wrap up the shutout, senior Alisa Liebowitz made quick work of her foe, taking the match 6–1, 6–1.
"We've been working very hard in practice," Tam mentioned. "I'm super excited for this season, and I think holding our own against a Division II team is a sign of good results to come."
The Tartans also competed Sunday against Mercyhurst College in Erie, Pa. Results will be posted on the Tartan website.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track and field teams traveled to Lewisburg, Pa. on Saturday to compete in Bucknell University’s annual Winter Classic. Despite stiff competition with many strong track and field programs participating, such as Division I teams including St. Francis University and Seton Hall, the Tartans challenged their opponents and achieved impressive results.
For the women, many individual performances were noteworthy. Sophomore Luci Laffitte won the long jump, clearing a distance of 4.95 meters. Laffitte also placed 13th in the 60-meter hurdles with a time of 9.77 seconds and tied for third place in the high jump, clearing a height of 1.55 meters. In the high jump, Laffitte was followed closely by senior Jessica Williams, who cleared a height of 1.50 meters, putting her in 12th place.
The women also fared well in the distance events. First-year Emily Wobb placed 12th in the 3000-meter run with a time of 10:46.59. In the 800-meter run, junior Courtney Baker placed third, followed by senior Diane Mattingly in seventh, with times of 2:21.27 and 2:25.33, respectively.
On the men’s side, the results were equally strong. For the field events, senior James Hulley took second in the shot put, throwing 16.15 meters, a season best, provisionally qualifying him again for the NCAA Indoor National Championship. 
Hulley initially qualified two weeks prior when he threw 16.12 meters, but Saturday’s throw puts him that much closer to going to nationals. 
Hulley also placed 12th in the weight throw, throwing a distance of 14.31 meters. Junior Pat O’Brien placed ninth in the triple jump, clearing 13.18 meters.
Junior Nate Bussiere led the way for the Tartans in the mile, as he took seventh with a time of 4:22.36. Sophomore Rob Morhard wasn’t far behind in ninth place with his 4:23.52 run. 
Junior J.P. Allera placed fourth in the men’s 5000-meter run in 15:35.19, and junior Justin Kurp was the track team’s highest individual finisher when he placed third in the 1000-meter run with a time of 2:36.74. 
The sprinters also finished strong, as junior Dustin Musselman’s 51.28 time in the 400-meter dash was good enough for eighth. First-year Ben Nealy took ninth in the men’s 500-meter dash in 1:09.79, and fellow first-year Daniel Ching placed 13th with his 8.93 run in the men’s 60-meter hurdles. 
The men’s 4x100 relay consisting of Bussiere, Musselman, O’Brien, and first-year John Caverhill placed sixth overall with a time of 3:28.99.
The Tartans will travel to Alliance, Ohio on Saturday to compete against Mount Union College. The Tartans have two more meets left before they  head to St. Louis, Mo. to compete in the UAA Outdoor Championships.

While the snowstorm loomed in the forecast, the men's and women's swimming and diving teams continued to work hard indoors in the pool with the end of their regular season quickly approaching. Recently, first-year Brandon Yee was named the University Athletic Association's (UAA) Men's Swimming Athlete of the Week with a notable performance in the meet against Denison University. Yee placed first in the 500-yard freestyle and second in the 200-yard freestyle in what was a close loss to the Big Red. Although he is only in the first year of his college career, Yee is already making a name for himself in the realm of Tartan athletics. 
Hailing from sunny Danville, Calif., Yee cites Pittsburgh's ever-changing weather as something that keeps him on his toes and adds to his college experience away from home. Yee affirms his decision to attend Carnegie Mellon on the basis of prestigious academics and successful athletics programs. Majoring in information systems, Yee hopes to pursue graduate school and a career in information securities in the future. 
Yee was named MVP three out of his four years on his high school swim team, and his dedication and talent seem to have carried over to his efforts here at Carnegie Mellon. With sights set on a conference championship and individual feats in the finals, Yee maintains a busy practice schedule with sessions in the mornings and afternoons in the group of distance swimmers. Besides weightlifting and teaming up to study, Yee and his fellow Tartans are forming friendships that extend beyond their time in the pool into social settings on the weekends and meetings during their free time. The Tartan swimmers and divers will head to Emory University in Atlanta, Ga. this upcoming weekend to compete in the UAA Championship meet and hope to continue their strong season into regional and national competitions in the coming weeks.

When it comes to design, nothing beats the elegance of nature. Nature is the ultimate paradox of simplicity and complexity — every feature is designed for its function, yet most are impossible to recreate without highly advanced technology. Undeterred, the NanoRobotics Lab aspires to re-create nature in the form of robots.
Led by associate professor Metin Sitti, the lab is part of the mechanical engineering department at Carnegie Mellon. It consists of a group of students working on a variety of robots that have been inspired by nature. Casey Kute, a Ph.D. student in mechanical engineering and a member of the NanoRobotics Lab, described the various projects the students are currently working on. “Projects range from particle manipulation with an atomic force microscope to magnetic micro-robots to a small hummingbird-inspired flier to palm-sized wall-climbing robots,” she said.
A robot created by the NanoRobotics Lab was designed to climb walls like a gecko, a small lizard able to climb vertical surfaces with ease. According to a Carnegie Mellon press release, an exhibit was held at the Museum of Science in Boston showcasing this robot. The innovation that allows the robot to climb a smooth, vertical wall is called dry fibrillar adhesives. “The gecko’s trick to sticking to surfaces lies in its feet, specifically the very fine hairs on its toes,” Kute said. “There are billions of these tiny hairs, which make contact with the surface and create a huge collective surface area of contact.”
Using this as a reference, the NanoRobotics Lab created a synthetic version of the gecko’s toes consisting of microscopic fibers with special tips that allow them to stick to surfaces. “The dry adhesion force comes from surface contact forces such as van der Waals forces, which act between all materials in contact,” said Kute. The Van der Waals forces, in this case, are attractive forces between molecules that come near to each other, allowing them to bond, or “stick,” to each other.
While the technology imitates a gecko’s physiology, the robot itself looks like a small box with circuitry and large wires extending from it, as recorded on a video available from the Museum of Science in Boston website. 
The box moves by rotating two cross-shaped objects connected to either side of it. Each of these crosses resembles a wheel with four thick spokes, without a circular rim around it. The ends of the spokes have the adhesive material attached. By rotating the crosses, the adhesive can selectively stick to walls, allowing for mobility. “Our robots use the principles used by geckos, but do not look like the lizard,” Kute said.
The team realizes it is better to not completely imitate nature, which has limitations. Rather, they base their robots on natural principles, but develop them further. “Nature evolves designs that are ‘good enough,’ which is to say they function well, but are not fully optimized. By looking to nature for inspiration, we can start with a partially optimized model. It allows us to move more quickly to a fully optimized model,” Kute explained.
While these robots are a technical achievement, current technological limitations still exist, preventing their practical use. Energy is an area of technology that is still surpassed by nature. “One main technical limitation is power. Animals in nature are able to metabolize their energy from their surroundings,” Kute said. “A robot has to either carry all of its power with it or be tethered, which limits its possible coverage area.” Another limitation is repair. Animals heal without the slightest thought as to what their body is doing, but re-creating the healing process in robots is difficult. “Animals are able to self-repair and adapt to their surroundings. obots are not yet widely able to do this,” Kute stated.
The robots offer practical purposes, as climbing robots can access rocky terrain more easily than those with wheels. The team already has applications of these robots in mind. “By having small robots that are able to cover diverse, complex environments, we hope that they will prove useful as knowledge sources for hazardous environments or places that are too small for humans to go. We anticipate our robots could help with pipe inspection, security monitoring, and medical applications,” Kute said.

The infamous “Asian glow” is hard to ignore. With as little as half a can of beer, a person’s normal complexion can transform into a bright crimson tint. This condition is very unique in that only a small percentage of the population at large actually has it. Most common among Pan-Asians, “Asian glow” is formally called Alcohol Flush Reaction (AFR) and has some additional symptoms including nausea, light-headedness, and an increased heart rate.
Some people believe that “Asian glow” is some sort of alcohol allergy. However, this is only a myth. AFR is the collection of symptoms that a person gets when he or she is unable to process alcohol in the body. Rather than an allergy, it is a genetic trait. It is the effect of alcohol consumption by those who lack the capacity to metabolize acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is a chemical that the body converts alcohol into during the digestion process. Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase is an enzyme in the body that is supposed to break up this converted acetaldehyde into a non-toxic substance like acetic acid. However, when the substance is not converted, it can be extremely harmful for the body and even be 30 times more toxic than alcohol.
When there is acetaldehyde in a person’s body, the capillaries in his or her face and neck are heavily dilated, causing a deep reddening that is shown on the surface of the skin. People with AFR may also experience a heavier hangover because acetaldehyde is also the primary cause of this morning-after alcohol induced headache. However, when there is less acetaldehyde in a person’s body, it means that most of it has been metabolized into acetic acid, which is relatively harmless.
It is mostly Asians that have this problem because of a genetic mutation in the Pan-Asian community that has descended through time. Those with AFR usually have a variation in their genes that make them deficient in ALDH2, which codes for acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.
This condition is inherited from one or both parents and is so pervasive because it is a dominant trait. In fact, about half of all Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Taiwanese, and Vietnamese populations have this mutated gene. Even when some Pan-Asians have enough ALDH2, the mutated enzyme is still there. In this case, the AFR symptoms are less dramatic and will usually leave the intoxicated individual looking flushed with other mild symptoms.
Excess acetaldehyde in the body can have detrimental effects. For one, those with AFR feel the same side effects of alcohol intoxication as any other person, such as dizziness, talkativeness, slurred speech, nausea, vomiting, and the ever-famous hangover. However, those with AFR have additional symptoms, such as a sudden raise in heart rate, and some people’s skin even starts to swell. It is important not to mistake the unique symptoms of AFR with the assumption that those people are just more easily inebriated.
Another serious problem associated with AFR is the increased likelihood of getting cancer. Because acetaldehyde is extremely carcinogenic, the likelihood of getting cancer after prolonged exposure is very high. Philip Brooks, a researcher at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in the United States, recommends that doctors educate their patients about the link between AFR and cancer, so people who have this reaction can take early preventive actions. For example, those with AFR may increase their chances of getting cancer by up to 600 percent by consuming about two cans of beer per day. However, not all side effects are bad. For example, those with this condition are less likely to become alcoholics.
Despite these many serious side-effects of AFR, the cures for this condition remain unknown. This has a great deal to do with the lack of randomized studies. Some suggest that taking Zantac and other such heartburn medication containing the drug Ranitidine may slightly mitigate the effects of AFR. Although some people have written off this reaction as a lifelong problem they just have to deal with, others have suggested that the repeated use of alcohol can slowly make the body more tolerant to some symptoms. However, this is not recommended due to the many negative side effects of alcohol itself and the increased risk of cancer.
When considering possible ways to alleviate symptoms, it is important to make sure that people do not confuse AFR with other conditions with similar symptoms. Alcohol has also been found to exacerbate or trigger other pre-existing conditions, such as Red Ear Syndrome, Rosacea, and Degreaser’s Flush.
Although “Asian glow,” as the nickname suggests, is found mostly among East Asians, there have been instances in which non-Asians also have this condition. If you consume alcohol regularly and think you may have this reaction, it is best to consult your physician for more information and alcohol consumption guidelines.

Since its detection in November 2008, the Conficker worm — also known as Downadup, Downup, and Kido — has spread and infected between 9 and 15 million computers, according to reports from CNN and United Press International. This makes it the largest computer worm infection since the SQL Slammer from 2003, which slowed down Internet traffic considerably.
A virus is a piece of harmful code that replicates itself and attaches itself to existing programs when infecting a computer. It usually affects certain files on the target computer. Computer worms, on the other hand, are self-replicating computer programs capable of transmitting copies of themselves over a network to other targets. These worms might also carry with them a payload program, which is capable of more malicious attacks than simple self-replication and transmission. Most malicious attacks are targeted at certain vulnerabilities of programs or operating systems. Creators of worms exploit these vulnerabilities and program their worms to multiply and transmit copies to all reachable computers that have the same vulnerabilities.
The Conficker worm exploited the MS08-067 vulnerability in the Windows Server and XP operating systems. he vulnerability allows computers to transmit information between each other. Microsoft has since issued various patches to fix the problem. However, all unpatched computers are still vulnerable.
The worm has evolved over the 15 months it has been known to exist. Today there are five different variants of this worm, making it more difficult to identify the total number of infected computers or to eradicate the worm entirely. While the first variants relied solely on network transmission of copies of the worm itself, the newer variants are capable of replicating and transferring themselves to other computers via removable flash media. These two means of worm propagation have enabled the Conficker worm to infect a large numbers of computers in two years. That the Conficker worm can gain control over computers on a network with weak passwords has enabled it to infect computers in supposedly high-security networks as well. The list of infected computers includes some in the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense and the unified armed forces of Germany.
Studies by Felix Leder and Tillmann Werner at the University of Bonn in Germany have shown that once settled in a computer, the worm will try to download updates to its software from any of a number of randomly generated IP addresses. This program might also contain code that causes the infected “zombie” computers to perform some action. What this action might be is not yet known, but theoretically it can have catastrophic effects on national defense and finance, among other things. The newer versions of the worm also appear to patch the underlying operating system vulnerability so it cannot be fixed as easily by updates or software, keeping the computer open to reinfection. Anti-virus company Symantec has shown that the two latest variants of Conficker also use peer-to-peer communication to check for infected computers before communicating with them and downloading updates. All of these techniques ensure the survival of the worm within an infected computer by downloading updates to the worm’s existing software.
Independent studies by SRI International and Symantec have enumerated the self-defense mechanisms that the Conficker worm has in place to protect itself once inside an infected machine. The first variant of this worm had no self-defense mechanisms, and the next few variants only prevented the computer from updating itself and thereby prevented patching of the vulnerabilities. The latest variants disable auto-update, disable safe mode, prevent the operation of anti-malware tools, and also restrict access to anti-malware sites, effectively rendering the computer completely helpless.
While it may seem difficult to clean an infected computer, most anti-virus companies offer a free download of the Conficker removal tool which can be run from a flash drive. It is true that the Conficker worm cannot infect a computer that has been cleaned and patched to cover the particular vulnerability that it exploits. icrosoft has issued this patch, and it is available as a free download to all users of genuine Windows operating systems. This leaves all pirated versions of Windows still vulnerable to the worm, and this is a particularly pressing problem in third-world countries where most operating systems are pirated.
While this computer worm uses advanced malware techniques that are well-known and researched, its use of multiple techniques has made the worm particularly hard to eradicate. The creators of the Conficker worm have not yet been identified, and Microsoft has issued a $250,000 reward for any information leading to their arrest and conviction. So far, Ukraine is most likely the origin of the worm, although no hard evidence has been produced. In the meantime, the only possible way to completely eradicate the worm is to disinfect infected computers and then patch them.

Google to offer high-speed Internet
Google announced on Wednesday that it would extend gigabit Internet (over 100 times the average speed in the United States) to as many as 500,000 people. The company has positioned the project as a way of demonstrating to the telecom industry and consumers that such improvements can be made at a reasonable cost. This move may force existing Internet providers to improve their own products. Google, however, does not intend to become a full-fledged Internet service provider (ISP).
As a large Internet company, Google has been hampered by the fact that its users do not have access to relatively inexpensive, fast Internet. Becoming an ISP and any subsequent developments that arise from it are likely to benefit Google as people begin to use more and more of its services.
Some areas may have access to this service by the end of the year, while others will have to wait longer. Its offering will also be different from other ISPs’ because the network will be open to other providers, a practice prevalent in other developed countries, but not in the United States.

Scientists sequence ancient genome
The genome of a man who died 4000 years ago in Greenland has been sequenced, and the results have provided great insight into both minor physical traits and ancient human migration patterns. Found in the 1980s, Inuk, as he has been named by scientists, was ignored until recently. Because he was relatively uncontaminated by modern human DNA, he was a good candidate for genome sequencing. Studies detailed his various traits, such as a predisposition to going bald, and also indicated that Inuk and his descendants are not closely related to the people who lived in Greenland in later years. Indeed, he is more closely related to people in Siberia than to the Inuit and Native Americans.
While Inuk’s genome is the first ancient genome to be sequenced, gene sequncing is still fairly expensive. However, the cost of gene sequencing technology is decreasing, and scientists believe this trend will ensure that Inuk’s sequenced genome is far from the last.

NASA launches new solar probe
At 10:23 p.m. last Thursday, NASA launched an Atlas V rocket carrying the Solar Dynamics Observatory, a probe that is meant to study the sun in much greater detail than ever before. As the first mission in NASA’s Living With a Star program, the probe will be used to develop models to predict solar weather patterns.
Many solar phenomena related to the sun’s magnetic field, such as solar flares, have a direct impact on life on Earth. Some of the more violent solar activities can damage satellites, disrupt power grids, and harm astronauts. Our increasing dependence on technologies that can be influenced by the sun means that the understanding provided by probes such as this one is becoming more and more important.
The technology behind the probe is in the form of three sensors that will take snapshots of the sun every 10 seconds and measure eight different parameters during each snapshot. This in turn will result in an immense amount of data, on the order of 1.5 terabytes per day, which will be interpreted in order to improve our methods of predicting solar weather patterns.

While the Big Apple may be hours away by train, car, or plane, New York City’s rich theater programs and talented performances are a lot closer than that. Broadway shows have marked out Pittsburgh as a stop for many of their performances, and many of the city’s drama students, notably Carnegie Mellon alumni, are also making a splash on stages across the country. Pittsburgh is fast becoming a cultural hub, not only a city to visit for many touring shows as they make their rounds, but also as a fountainhead of aspiring talent.
The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s history tells the story of the transformation of the city from industry town to vibrant cultural center as a series of renaissances. Arguably, Pittsburgh has had a long history of reinventing itself: going from smog and steel to sustainable industry, shifting from trust belt city to a center for the arts to flourish. The Trust, formed in 1984 by Jack Heinz and a small group of his friends and companions, made it its mission to transform the run-down downtown into an urban hub. After restoring the Stanley Theater, now known as the Benedum Center, the trust began working its way through the downtown area, revitalizing it with theaters, open spaces, and public art projects. Now, thanks to the Trust, the downtown area boasts over 14 different performing arts venues and is still going strong.
However, while having facilities to host cultural events is a start, other components are crucial in making Pittsburgh the success story that it is. Performers, technicians, and dramatists are needed to put on the shows, and an audience must come to support them. The various universities in the city provide eager actors, and the smaller venues in town provide great jumping points for a career in show business.
While the life of an actor can be fraught with challenges, some graduates of Carnegie Mellon’s School of Music have achieved especially notable success in their line of work. Students of associate professor of music Douglas Ahlstedt have found themselves particularly well prepared. One of them, Liam Bonner, is debuting at the Metropolitan Opera’s February production of Carmen. Another, Jeffrey Behrens, will also be making his debut at the Metropolitan in The Nose in March. Graham Fenton, another former student, is in Jersey Boys, singing the role of Frankie Valli. Other acclaimed alumni of the School of Music can be found in City That Never Sleeps. Patricia Phillips wows crowds as Carlotta in The Phantom of the Opera, currently the longest-running Broadway production to date. Alumnae Catherine Walker and Christine Noll also took the stage by storm in the recent revival of Ragtime, which had its final performance this January.
Pittsburgh also has upcoming performances of its own to showcase its local and traveling talent: The Benedum’s spring season is packed with Broadway shows for the discerning theater enthusiast. Coming up soon is Xanadu, the somewhat whimsical tale of redemption and roller derbies, set in the 1980s. Sonny, the male lead, is a struggling artist unsure of what to do with his life until he meets Kira, an Australian rollerskater, who inspires him to pursue his long-forgotten dream of starting a roller disco. However, little does Sonny know that the attractive Kira is none other than Clio, the muse of history, in disguise. All’s well for Clio as she helps her mortal query with his dream, until she realizes that she’s falling for him. Her sisters, the other muses, naturally take full advantage of her plight as they aspire to undermine Clio’s position as leader of the muses. The show is based on a movie from the ’80s that enjoyed tepid success at the box office but has become a cult classic. The theater production has made an unexpected splash on the Broadway scene, perhaps owing to its unique combination of mythology and wacky trends of the past. The opening night for Xanadu is Feb. 23, and it runs through Feb. 28.
Also coming up at the Benedum is Grease. For those unfamiliar with the plot of the show, the show is set in the 1950s and follows the lives of 10 teenagers in high school as they go through the familiar conflicts of life and love. Billed as a rock and roll musical, it confronted issues of gang violence, teenage pregnancy, experimentation, and rebellion. Sandy and Danny, the two main characters, go through an unresolved love affair from over the summer break that blossoms into a mess of misunderstandings and hurt feelings during the school year. Sandy, the new kid at the Rydell High School, finds that she has a lot to learn about fitting in, especially if she wants to be part of the Pink Ladies, the school’s most popular group of girls. Danny also has to overcome his pride to accept how attached he is to Sandy. Eventually, after sock hops and slumber parties, the two finally confront each other about their feelings. The show runs from March 9 to March 14. Interestingly, Taylor Hicks of American Idol fame will be playing the part of Teen Angel for this performance.
Another beloved classic coming to Pittsburgh is The Wizard of Oz. A musical based on L. Frank Baum’s delightful children’s book, The Wizard of Oz follows the story of Dorothy as she longs for a life more exciting than living on a farm in Kansas with her Auntie Em and Uncle Henry. A tornado rushes through the state, sweeping up everything in its path, including Dorothy, her dog Toto, and her house. When everything stops spinning, Dorothy finds herself in the Land of Oz, a different realm where magic is very much real and nothing is ordinary. While she loves being in a new place, Dorothy soon realizes that she misses her family and begins a quest to find a power that can take her back home. Advised to journey to the Emerald City to seek an audience with the Wizard of Oz, a powerful sorcerer who can solve any problem, Dorothy meets up with her memorable companions, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion. Naturally, the Wicked Witch of the West will stop at nothing to foil the heroine’s plans and confronts her at every turn. A classic way before Wicked broke onto the scene, The Wizard of Oz rejoices in the magic of childhood, all the while recalling that sometimes the most important things are the ones we don’t realize we love so much until they’re gone. The Wizard of Oz premieres on March 30 and will be in Pittsburgh until April 4.
While that bevy of shows rounds out the theater scene at the Benedum for this spring, plans for the summer and early fall season are already in the works. The Benedum has just released plans to host The Phantom of the Opera from Aug. 25 to Sept. 19. The Phantom of the Opera is currently the longest running Broadway show. It follows the life of aspiring singer Christine Daaé as she attempts to gain fame at the Paris Opera. Things aren’t very easy for Christine: She must contend with the diva Carlotta, the opera’s star performer who refuses to relinquish any of her roles to the ingénue, and the affections of Raoul, her vicomte suitor. However, Christine’s voice is spectacular, thanks to the tutelage of her mysterious teacher, the Phantom. Plots and schemes abound as the Phantom falls for his student and takes drastic action to assure that she has the success and attention that she deserves.
Pittsburgh, though it may not be as big as New York, Boston, or other urban areas, is still a force to be reckoned with in terms of talent and performing arts offerings. It is a city that prides itself on coping with new challenges and is a rising star in cultural districts across the country, with many opportunities for drama students and theater aficionados alike to enjoy its artistic offerings.

Enrique Metinides describes himself as a crime scene photographer. In many ways this modest title is apt; he shot his first dead body when he was 12 and has worked as a newspaper photographer for 50 years since. When you see his work, which subtly reveals mankind’s fascination with all things grotesque, the title seems humorously conventional. 
Overlooking Metinides’ skills as an artist in favor of those as a newspaperman is easy to do. Metinides is often described by critics as Mexico City’s Weegee, a fellow crime scene photographer in the early 1900s who often juxtaposed glamor and gore. This very literal interpretation of Metinides’ work speaks to his talent within his profession. 
To me, however, Metinides’ work mirrors that of Jeff Wall, whose battle scenes are posed and extensively edited in order to look like surreal depictions of everyday life. Metinides’ work isn’t simply about grief shot in good lighting; it’s about grief, voyeurism, beauty, and simplicity shot in the moment. 
It happens to be fitting that Metinides’ pop culture relics-turned-art-form are hung at the Andy Warhol Museum, on Pittsburgh’s North Side. Here, viewers are encouraged to look past the macabre, tabloid-like essence of the photos to sneak a peek at human nature. 
People’s guilty fascination with the crime scenes is repeatedly shown in Metinides’ work. In one, two young siblings sit dead in the back of a crashed car while two grown men look in through a cracked window. The men look at the camera, guilty at having been caught staring at the car wreck, angry at being forced to look away. In another, an aerial view shows a mob surrounding a crash. In the corner of a photograph, an ice cream vendor has moved toward the crowd, hoping to make a profit. 
Controlled chaos is also a theme in the Warhol Museum’s exhibit. In a supermarket robbery, a policeman wielding a gun is in the foreground. Only when you look closer do you see a woman injured in the crossfire between cop and robber. In an interview with VBS.tv, Metinides explained matter-of-factly that an article about the robbery was never printed because the supermarket where the robbery occurred sponsored the paper. In another picture, a woman has hanged herself on a tree. Instead of being gruesome, the image is quiet and beautiful. It almost seems as if she is standing on one of the larger roots, about to jump.
An appropriate title for Metinides is still up in the air. “Artist” would be ill-fitting for work so based on the surreal details of real events. “Photographer” seems to deny the concept behind Metinides’ imagery. Like Warhol himself, Metinides may forever have to walk the line between culture-bound imagery and artistic sentiment. For now, go determine for yourself where you think Metinides should stand by seeing Maimed in Mexico at the Warhol Museum, running through April 18.

The following is an excerpt from an obituary written by two Carnegie Mellon Ph.D. students to commemorate the life of historian Howard Zinn.
Howard Zinn died recently, on Jan. 27. This is surely not an informative statement for those interested in his work and legacy, who have been mourning this loss since that Wednesday. As a historian who intimately experienced the hottest political moments of the 20th century — like the Great Depression, World War II (in which he served as a bombardier), the Cold War, and the fall of the Berlin Wall — while being educated in school and academic environments absent of bigotry, political propaganda, and religious fundamentalism, Zinn belonged to a generation that produced most of the brightest intellectuals of outstanding talent and diligent effort in analyzing and studying U.S. society from a radical point of view. 
Zinn now joins a number of brilliant scholars who have recently passed away, such as Giovanni Arrighi, Gerald Cohen, and Peter Gowan. 
The common subject among Zinn’s publications is his rather different perspective on U.S. history, starting with the arrival of the first European settlers; his focus on the people as history’s main collective agent, rather than the mainstream approach based on individuals; and anecdotal political episodes.
The concept of class struggle was pivotal. Considered to be one of the most important legacies of Karl Marx, it allows the analysis of several events of the history of human societies as direct consequences of historical dynamics that have class as their main agency. 
The Great Depression of the ’30s is a good example of how this alternative historiographical method has the most powerful explanation ability. Zinn experienced this harsh period of American history and the following economic recovery due to the policy measures implemented by the Democratic government of Franklin Roosevelt. Among several influences, Zinn helped us to understand that Roosevelt’s New Deal — a series of measures aimed to revive investment and consumption and to relieve the acute social problems caused by unemployment — was a reaction to the class struggle generated by the Great Depression, which could be objectively observed from intense social contestation, politically organized, toward the wealthiest sectors of society.
Later, during the ’50s and ’60s, after fighting for his country and seeing the rise and fall of dictatorships during World War II, Zinn became a strong and influential human rights activist in fighting against racial segregation in the U.S. and against ensuing wars. These actions were taken together with a generation of U.S. Marxist intellectuals that developed political roots against conservative elites and always stood for the people. This generation acted as a powerful, intellectual, “organic” collective that supported the civil rights movement and the fight against the Vietnam War.
In opposition to a traditional historical point of view, in which the masses are practiced to iconic events and figures mystified and created by the biased view of the influential elites, as a scholar deeply interested and involved in class struggle, Zinn was pivotal in establishing the American people as the central character of U.S. history in the notable history textbook A People’s History of the United States, a book that has been present in various contemporary icons of popular culture, such as The Sopranos. This work, which faced severe intellectual persecution inside academia, testifies to the unique intellectual qualities of Zinn as a hardworking academic who was the bearer of a clear insight to his objectives, and a solid interdisciplinary intellectual background that went beyond the scope of a single area of study.
With few exceptions, such as the Canadian Naomi Klein, we don’t see similar individuals in the intellectual firmament of the globalized world. We fear that a generation of brilliant intellectuals is being lost and that no equivalent is being generated in the global academic environment. The work of Zinn may provide us with the guidelines to action and change, knowing that it is the people who make their own destiny.
We have particular responsibilities in the current historical context. We live in a period of acceleration of history, where substantial changes occur globally in a short amount of time, severely affecting our habits of life. Aspects of globalization like the Internet, associated with consumerism-oriented visual mass culture, can be considered factors that affect the intellectual development of scholars who are more worried in publishing fast and getting funding even faster in order to climb the ladder of academic hierarchy in the quickest way possible. This leads us to follow a path of particular knowledge specialization that may imply an unedited alienation of the intellectual intelligentsia from the social reality that surrounds us. 
We should look to the example of Zinn as one of broad historical knowledge and social engagement that the ones who believe that a better world is possible should follow.

You might not remember exactly where you were on Feb. 1, 2004, but your jaw and the jaws of 89.8 million other people surely dropped at the conclusion of one of the most anticipated televised performances of the year. If the date doesn’t ring a bell, maybe the term “wardrobe malfunction” will spark your memory.
Immediately after the notorious 2004 Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake incident, the media was swarmed with statements from CBS, the FCC, and the performers themselves.
Organizers of the next Super Bowl halftime show pulled a 180 for the 2005 performance, inviting Paul McCartney to the stage. This decision eliminated any possible sensual songs, sexy choreography, or suggestive costumes, and thus the risk of having another disaster like the previous year was avoided. After all, no one really expected McCartney to give a free peep show.
In the years since the Jackson incident, the halftime show has hosted musicians with a bit more life experience. In 2005, McCartney performed at 63; in 2006 Mick Jagger was 63; in 2007 Prince was 49; in 2008 Tom Petty was 58; in 2009 Bruce Springsteen was 60; and finally, in 2010, Roger Daltrey (of The Who) was 65 when he took the stage.
Generation Y will probably agree that the shows aren’t exactly what they’re dying to see. But if one looked at the younger population, the halftime show acts might include Lady Gaga or Taylor Swift. However, Gaga tends to deter more people than she attracts, due to her whimsical, avant-garde, over-the-top costumes, and Swift’s fans probably don’t overlap too well with the folks who watch and attend the big game. Thus, it becomes a matter of catering to the audience.
Another drastic consequence of the wardrobe malfunction was the introduction of a delay in broadcasting. No longer truly “live,” delays allow TV stations extra time to cut away from something offensive to the viewers, should it suddenly pop up. After the Jackson episode, The Grammys and the Oscars, both in February, were cautious (implementing 10-minute delays), as both shows featured several performances that, being live, could end just as disastrously as the Super Bowl halftime show. As time passed, though, delays were shortened, and now average at around 10 seconds.
So in wondering why halftime shows don’t have the appeal that they used to, just look back to 2004. Sure, if Timberlake and Jackson actually did do it on purpose, maybe they thought that being controversial would garner more viewers or media attention. If this is true, they surely didn’t consider the consequences implemented for future halftime shows.
The generation gap of performers parallels the generation gap in viewers. And if the Super Bowl halftime show follows a pattern for their selection of performers, we can probably predict the 2011 performer by looking back at the top of the charts several decades ago.

The 52nd annual Grammy awards took place on Jan. 31 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. This year, like every other, topped the one before it. Artists such as Beyonce and Taylor Swift led the night in winning awards. Swift took home four awards, including Album of the Year for her hit record Fearless, officially becoming the youngest musician to win the title. Her other wins included Best Country Album, Best Country Song, and Best Female Country Vocal Performance, all without any interruptions from Kanye West.
Needless to say, the night’s big winner was none other than Beyonce Knowles. The R&B singer took home six Grammys, the most ever for a female artist in one Grammy night. She won Song of the Year and Best R&B Song for her hit “Single Ladies” and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for “Halo.” Kings of Leon nabbed three different awards for their popular song “Use Somebody,” and Knowles’ hubby Jay-Z left the building with three more Grammys to put on his mantle. The Black Eyed Peas won three Grammys, including Best Pop Vocal Album for The E.N.D.
Aside from distributing awards, many celebrities were also there to perform. The show opened with one of 2009’s most recognized and unique artists, Lady Gaga. Every time the camera is on her, we see her in a more outrageous outfit than before and dancing in an even more far-fetched style, and yet we continue to go back for more. She performed a duet with Elton John before claiming two awards of her own, Best Dance Album for The Fame and Best Electronica/Dance Song for “Poker Face.” After delivering a memorable performance of “21 Guns” with the American Idiot musical cast, Green Day won the Best Rock Album award for 21st Century Breakdown. Knowles soon took to the stage and she, along with a SWAT team of dancers, took the night with her performance of “If I Were a Boy” and covering Alanis Morissette’s hit “You Oughta Know.” Audiences raved when Pink dangled from the ceiling with her acrobatic performance of “Glitter in the Air.” Finally, in a creative collaboration, Lil Wayne, Eminem, Drake, and Blink 182 drummer Travis Barker performed “Drop the World” and “Forever,” and because the performers refused to use the edited versions of the two songs, the network profanity censors had to work extra hard on this performance.
One voice that is still heard in the hearts of many is one that is no longer with us. Where would we be in music without the musical contributions of Michael Jackson? Stunning the world even after his passing, Jackson continued to warm the hearts of many through the voices of Celine Dion, Smokey Robinson, Jennifer Hudson, Usher, and Carrie Underwood as they sang along to his “Earth Song” in a 3-D tribute to the King of Pop. Jackson’s children Prince and Paris were in attendance to accept their father’s Lifetime Achievement Award, and 12-year-old Prince left the crowd with these words: “Through all his songs, his message was simple: love.”
While the Grammys drew viewers to the television screen, it also sent fans to music stores. According to a Billboard report, the Grammys drove a 3.3 percent increase in album sales in comparison to the previous week. With the variety of artists and the many different genres of music represented, who knows what next year has in store?

In spring of 2009, Nicholas Lamp studied abroad at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. While there, he met a group of friends that decided to go to New Zealand for spring break. Lamp decided to keep a journal of his trip, which proved to be worthwhile, as the week Lamp spent in New Zealand with his friends was one of the best times of his life. The following is an excerpt from Lamp’s journal describing his adventure rafting in the New Zealand rapids.
Monday, April 13, 2009:
On Monday morning I woke up early to cook pancakes and bacon before heading out to go white water rafting. I had called the location up the night before for directions but the man with whom I spoke told me to make a left when we had actually needed to make a right, and as a result, we ended up getting lost. Luckily, we figured it out and weren’t too late.
We arrived at a small car park to see our guides getting things prepared for us. It was a very cloudy day and the second we all stepped out of the car, it started to rain and the wind began to blow harder. It wasn’t looking like the day would be very fun; it seemed like we would be freezing the entire time, but the guides provided us each with two sets of thermal pants and shirts that instantly got us all warmed up. It felt as if we could stand at the North Pole in the middle of a blizzard and still be completely warm.
My friend Brian and I were able to get into our gear first and, just about the time that we did, a helicopter flew in and touched down nearby. We were riding a helicopter up to the start of the river! Brian and I climbed in the tiny aircraft and put on the headphones inside to dampen the noise. Almost immediately, the pilot took off more smoothly than any airplane could have ever hoped to. We climbed about 100 feet and skimmed over the tree tops and across the river we were going to raft in, in an exhilarating ride. The pilot dipped up and down and side to side, giving us the sensation of being weightless numerous times in the smoothest and most fun rollercoaster ride I’ve ever been on. After landing 20 kilometers upstream after a mere five-minute ride, Brian and I hopped out and headed over to a few rocks where our guides were leading us.
As we waited for the helicopter to return and shuttle the rest of our friends to our position, the guide told us about the surrounding area. Apparently, gold runs through the river and some hot springs nearby. I immediately started looking around on the ground for some gold nuggets, hoping to pay for the whole trip with a lucky find.
The second time the helicopter came in for a landing, the guide told us to brace ourselves for the wind that it would produce. The pilot dropped the load of rafts and oars before going in for a landing that I apparently wasn’t prepared enough for. The wind blew me backward to a rock I hadn’t noticed and I fell. The whole thing made me laugh quite a bit and enjoy the entire experience even more. The pilot then took off once again and gathered the others while Ed, Brian, and I pumped up the rafts. Once the final group of people arrived, the rafts were nearly completely blown up and the guides gave us the standard safety briefings.
We were finally ready to get on our way and we set off on our rafting adventure. Within 60 seconds we were being briefed about our first grade-three rapid (medium difficulty), and within the next 60 seconds we were going through it.
The entire trip was action-packed as we went through rapids between the grades of three and five (six being the deadly, illegal kind). The calmest moments of our trips were the parts when we needed to pull over to the side of the river to be given a safety briefing on the coming rapids. There were two times on the trip when we needed to get out of the boats and walk around turns in the river because they were simply too dangerous to pass over, but even these moments were intense as we needed to hike up the walls of the river valley and then travel down them on the other side.
After drifting through a passage known as the “grand canyon of New Zealand” — one of the most stunning sights on the trip with 100-foot cliff walls and waterfalls pouring down into the river from either side — we pulled our boats up onto the bank for lunch. Another meal of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches refueled our tanks and we walked up the stream we were parked next to. We hiked up some massive boulders to a cliff edge overlooking the stream and a 50-meter waterfall 20 meters away from us. After a nice little group photo, we were allowed to jump the 15 feet into the water below, which was a lot of fun.
We swam to shore and then hiked back to our boats on the bank, pushed them into the water, and began the journey again. More rapids and exciting twists and turns left us at the end with only a few grade twos and threes left for us to traverse. 
Further down the river on a dinky grade three, the guide was distracting us all with some lame little joke and a wave came and broadsided us, knocking me out of the boat. I surfaced and heard the guide telling me to swim to the paddle that was being held out to me while everyone was laughing, but I accidentally thought he meant for me to swim to the paddle I had dropped. So I swam to the wrong paddle, which made everyone laugh more as they were finally pulling me into the boat once I swam the right way.
The end of the trip had us all thanking our guides as much as possible. We climbed into our cars and shouted some more goodbyes out the window as we rambled on along the road to our campsite.

Dear Rohit,
I’ve been super anti-social lately. It’s not because I’m depressed, it’s just because I always choose the wrong people to hang out with and they always end up stabbing me in the back later. I really enjoy my alone time, but I’m afraid I might be using it as an escape. How can I find better people to spend my time with?
—Socially Apart
Dear Apart,
I feel for you! But really, overall, I think it’s best not to settle when it comes to friends, especially if you think you’ll be disappointed. It’s just like significant others — you need to take the time to think about it.
Look for friends that you feel good around. They could be closer than you think, waiting for the backstabbers to scatter like roaches being attacked by super-strength Raid. These people could be at your favorite lounge spots, in your classes, in the UC by the black chairs watching the muted TV at 3 a.m. — the possibilities are limitless.
And if, at any point, these people start making you feel worthless, keep them at bay and start your search again. Besides, it takes a really mature and self-aware person to be able to have their alone time without going crazy about it, so feel free to keep doing that, as long as you hang out with some of your prospective friends too.
So long to the solo,
—Rohit
Dear Rohit,
How can I cut the bad influences out of my life? I am talking about people in particular.
—Seeking Some Better Influences
Dear Seeking,
You should invest in a pair of heavy-duty scissors—and no, I am not suggesting that you literally cut someone, because that would be wrong. Very, very wrong. 
What I am suggesting is that you walk away from people who are affecting you in a negative way. The best way to go about this would be to confront these bad influences and tell them why you are wielding those scissors and pointing them in their direction. That way, they won’t be coming around asking why you stopped talking to them all of a sudden and they won’t be giving you the evil eye.
Make sure that when and if you cut those people out of your life, you remain open to accepting new and better individuals as your friends and colleagues.
You’ll find good people,
—Rohit

The house lights of Mr. Small’s Theatre & Funhouse come on and I notice a couple of facts: First, Mr. Small’s does not seem ventilated enough for a smoking venue; second, the Arctic Monkeys are fantastic; and finally, this crowd is terrible. Maybe it was the $30 ticket price, but almost everyone seemed over 40 and more concerned about the babysitter than the music. The crowd that night, from the bar to the stage, never moved. So where was the young and gunning college crowd? Where were the people known for kicking up musical storms?
Sadly, everyone was just hanging around campus. Chalk it up to price and distance, but no one was making their way out to Millvale. Even worse, most of the people I talked to thought Pittsburgh just didn’t have a very good music scene. Well, Pittsburgh may not be New York, but we certainly get good music.
The Arctic Monkeys were one of the biggest bands to tour Europe back in 2006. They played chart-topping hits at world- famous venues. Why they bothered to come to Pittsburgh I don’t know. I just felt lucky. When the tickets were only $30, I was grateful. Those tickets were nowhere near the $90 I’d be paying for the Ben Folds concert the next day.
I flash back to all of this because once again, the house lights are coming on and once again the crowd is older. I can appreciate their taste in music now, but the lack of enthusiasm is a thorough buzz kill. I need a younger crowd and a girl I can dance with.

Each year, Carnegie Mellon hosts a variety of panels and lectures with the goal of inspiring the campus and the surrounding community. In the spring, Carnegie Mellon will continue this tradition by hosting a series of lectures in a student-organized conference in April.
Carnegie Mellon’s TEDx will mirror the nationally recognized TEDTalks, created by Technology, Entertainment, Design (TED), an organization dedicated to what it calls “ideas that are worth spreading.” TED was founded in 1984 as an American nonprofit organization created to bringing attention to new ideas. TED’s first official conference took place in 1990, where featured guests were invited to share their ideas relating to the three themes of technology, entertainment, and design. Since then, the themes discussed in TEDTalks have become much broader — hosting many insightful discussions with a series of experts, world leaders, and artists. Some of the more prominent speakers have included former  Vice President Al Gore, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, and jazz musician Herbie Hancock. The annual conferences in Long Beach and Oxford bring together the world’s “thinkers and doers” who are challenged to give the lecture of their lives — in only 18 minutes.
Now, almost 20 years later, according to TED’s official website, TED is still going strong in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, with its speakers offering new ways to look at the world. On TED’s website www.ted.com, performances from TED events are available to the world, for free. More than 500 TEDTalks are now available.
The nonprofit has also created a program known as TEDx, which allows other organizations like schools and businesses to plan and host a conference of their own. Carnegie Mellon School of Art professor Golan Levin, a speaker at a previous TED conference, believes “it lends some profile to what is otherwise a local affair.”
A group of students at Carnegie Mellon expressed interest in setting up a conference, and after much planning, the event has finally gotten off the ground and is planned to take place on April 4, 2010. The event will appeal to all students regardless of interest or major. According to TED’s official website, “This immersive environment allows attendees and speakers from vastly different fields to cross-fertilize and draw inspiration from unlikely places.” Unlike the official conferences, which are by invitation only, TEDx tickets will be available to students, staff, and the greater community.
Carnegie Mellon has had plenty of interaction with TED in the past. The city of Pittsburgh hosted a TEDx Leadership Pittsburgh conference on Nov. 14, 2009, which was attended by six professors from Carnegie Mellon. One attendee, professor Charlee Brodsky from the School of Design, claimed that there was “never a dull moment.”
“It mixes the arts with humanities with the sciences,” said Brodsky, a professor of photography, who represented her vocation through a series of pictures set in India. The main focus of her talk was the combination of pictures and words that had been organized in a specific order to convey meaning. Within the other featured talks, spanning topics from computer science to poetry, she believed that “there always seemed to be something for everyone.”
A Facebook fan page has been created publicizing of Carnegie Mellon’s TEDx talks, currently sporting over 800 fans. Several speakers have been lined up. Tickets will soon be available via online reservation.

Last Monday through Wednesday, Carnegie Mellon canceled classes for the first time since 2003 — and for the first three-day period in the university’s history.
In a move that might have seemed a bit out of character for Carnegie Mellon, the university’s administration identified the safety risk inherent in a blizzard of the magnitude that swept through Pittsburgh last week, and put classes on hold.
How is the official decision to cancel classes made? “The city recommended that colleges and universities close, and we complied with that request,” explained Michael Murphy, vice president for campus affairs, the individual who makes the final decision to close the school or remain open on a snow day.
“It is never an easy decision to cancel classes, and it is rare that we do so,” Murphy said in a Feb. 10 e-mail to The Tartan. “It is certainly not ideal to have to cancel classes, ever, and we hope to get the campus back to normal as soon as possible.”
While the decision to close was an important one made with the consideration of campus community members’ safety, three days of missed classes could mean significant money out of students’ pockets. 
First-year tuition is $40,300 and there are 70 school days in a semester, meaning that first-year students pay roughly $287 per day of instruction. Three fewer days of school means about $861 worth of instruction has been lost — unless those days are made up later.
There is no official decision yet from the university as to whether the missed days will be made up later in the semester, but Murphy said it would be “premature” to rule out such an option. Murphy explained that because course syllabi are already designed, “the handling of missed class time is at the discretion of the individual faculty teaching each course.”
While their responses to the three-day cancellation period are varied, several professors are responding to the snow days by making little, if any, change, to their semester plans. Professor Roger Rouse, an associate teaching professor in the department of history, has tried to limit changes to his original course plans. “I’ve told students that we’ll keep to the original schedule of lectures and readings (i.e., that we won’t drop or postpone later topics to go back over what we were meant to cover this week) but that I plan to weave key points concerning this week’s topics into my next few lectures,” said Rouse in an e-mail to The Tartan.
Rouse acknowledged that the decision to cancel was likely a difficult one on the part of the university administration, and that such sweeping decisions often have case-by-case consequences.
“I don’t have enough information to give informed advice about how the university should address the problems created by the cancellations,” said Rouse, “but my guess is that the best thing it can do is to encourage professors to respond in ways that are sensitive to the challenges students face on a course-by-course basis.”
Laurie Eisenberg, another associate teaching professor in the same department, demonstrated how even within the same academic area, professors are adjusting distinctly to the three-day cancellation last week. “I will be deciding whether to strike one week’s topic from the syllabus entirely or whether to move more quickly than I had planned and still fit everything in,” Eisenberg said.
“Students have no idea how long instructors labor over their syllabi,” she said.
In the true nature of Carnegie Mellon, President Jared Cohon has proposed the idea of a university-based task force to help the city figure out how to deal with such weather emergencies in the future, according to an article published last week in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. The group would be composed of Carnegie Mellon faculty, staff, and students from departments across campus. Pittsburgh City Councilman William Peduto said Cohon offered free services to design a modernized route system, including a feature where residents can track snow plows online.
The offer includes help from the engineering and computer science departments, the Heinz College, and other Carnegie Mellon departments. It would take several months and collaboration between mulitple schools to develop a plan that could be presented to City Council.
While the task of combating two significant blizzards is indeed a mammoth one, there is a pervasive sentiment city-wide that city officials did not do enough to deal with the inclement weather. “We as a university, and as a city,” Murphy said, “simply cannot risk such a situation in the future.”

Amizade Global Service-Learning, a Pittsburgh-based nonprofit organization that offers service-based study to students around the nation, has recently taken a stand for international human rights.
Uganda has been the subject of much debate within the international community for its negative stance on homosexuality. 
On Oct. 14, 2009, a member of the Ugandan Parliament introduced an “Anti-Homosexuality Bill” that would put into place some of the harshest anti-gay regulations in the world. Amizade has responded to the Ugandan government’s anti-homosexual legislation with a clear and decisive move toward justice for Ugandan nationals and safety for participating students.
Previously, students studying at Amizade’s Tanzania base traveled through Kampala, Uganda at the beginning and end of the program. However, in response to Uganda’s anti-gay policies, Amizade Tanzania semester site coordinators will now meet the students in Kigali, Rwanda. The change in operation will ensure that Amizade does not spend money within Uganda, and therefore will not support an unjust law.
Stephanie Vickery, a Point Park University graduate, volunteers for an NGO named MAVUNO and is currently the program facilitator for Amizade’s Tanzania site.
“Amizade’s move out of Uganda was important not only in its intent to display sympathy and support for criminalized homosexuals, but also a means of educating the population at large,” Vickery explained.
Amizade’s director of operations and African/Caribbean programs Brandon Cohen added that Uganda’s human rights violations were not the only deciding factor in the change: The Amizade administration was also concerned for the safety of participating students.
“We’re not policy experts, but we monitor policy to be sure that our volunteers and students are safe,” Cohen said. 
“When this appeared in the news, it seemed to be a good opportunity to stand and say that we’re not going to engage and give funds to a government that supports this anti-human rights measure. At the same time, we saw it as a chance to protect our participants and staff — who may or may not be homosexuals themselves — from any abuse.”
Amizade implements study abroad programs that combine service-focused learning with academic courses offered through West Virginia University.
Graham Hubbs, who recently received his Ph.D. from the University of Pittsburgh’s philosophy department, currently acts as the on-site professor for the organization’s Tanzania base. Hubbs accompanies students on service-based trips and also teaches two courses in Tanzania: International Justice and Nationalism as well as Internationalism and Identity.
“Amizade saw the matter as a human rights issue and decided to respond with what, effectively, amounts to an economic boycott,” Hubbs said. “The reasoning was quite simple: Amizade did not want to contribute to the economy of a state that, in its view, was heading in the wrong direction on a fundamental human right.”
The Pittsburgh community has responded positively to Amizade’s change in operation, with many seeing the adjustment as a brave step toward protecting the equality of Ugandan citizens while simultaneously speaking out against an unjust government.
“A lot of people might think that boycotting seems like an extreme reaction. But in a sense, it seems like, more and more, officials aren’t listening to the people, so boycotts and public demonstrations become the only way that the people can get their attention,” said Sara Faradji, a first-year global studies major.
Vickery agrees that communicating the organization’s displeasure to the government is a goal discussed at the inception of the boycott. However, she also believes that the boycott will be seen by the Ugandan nationals as an act of solidarity.
“In pulling out, we are not merely trying to send a message of displeasure to the parliament,” Vickery said. “We are also saying to the Ugandan people: Do not be afraid of your brothers and sisters. Do not be persuaded by hate. Do know that among the most essential prerequisites for development and progress are human rights, and our resources and efforts must move with those persuaded by equality in the here and now.”
Amizade encourages intercultural exploration and understanding through community-driven volunteer and service focused learning programs in 14 communities and 10 countries. Since its creation in 1994, Amizade Global Service-Learning has helped over 4000  volunteers ages 13 to 83 contribute over 140,000 hours of service.

For finding information quickly, search engines have become an integral part of our lives.
Carnegie Mellon Ph.D. alumnus Qi Lu has a mission to improve that experience for Internet users through Bing, Microsoft’s search engine, which was launched in June 2009. 
Lu, president of Microsoft’s Online Services Division since late 2008, is heading the company’s venture into the search engine market and, simultaneously, the competition against Google.
Raised by his grandparents in a poor, rural village in China, Qi Lu attended Furan University in China, completing his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in computer science. Lu was noticed by a Carnegie Mellon University professor at a lecture, and, as a result, traveled to the United States to obtain his Ph.D. 
According to Mahadev Satyanarayanan (Satya), Lu’s Ph.D. advisor, Lu quickly became known for his work ethic, humble personality, and dedication to his studies.
“At the time when he was here as a student, he concentrated on his Ph.D. research and his thesis. He was focused and very driven,” Satya said.  “The qualities that people have stay with them, regardless of what their roles are in industry and academia.”
Upon graduating, Lu worked as a research associate for Carnegie Mellon, then as a research staff member for IBM before beginning work at Yahoo! in 1998. 
Formerly the executive vice president of Engineering for Search and Advertising Technology at Yahoo!, Lu is no stranger to competition with Google. Despite Google’s hold on search engine use, Lu is determined to advance Bing as a search engine capable of providing help in decision making, in addition to developing improved accuracy.
Unlike Microsoft’s previous  experience with static software and computer innovation, development of Bing instead must adapt to a rapidly changing environment.
“The pace at which innovation happens in this search engine world happens so fast that you need to think and act differently,” Satya said.
Although Bing’s development has only begun, Microsoft’s search market share has grown from 8 to 11 percent since its inception, a promising sign of Lu’s efforts — though Google still has over 60 percent of the market share. These gains primarily took space belonging to Yahoo! and other lesser-used search engines, but they are a positive sign for Microsoft’s investment in Bing.
Though they are competitors in the market, students at Carnegie Mellon recognize the unique connection between Google and Microsoft, both as workplaces for graduates and as forces on Carnegie Mellon’s campus — offering grants, facilities, and funding faculty and sudent research. 
“I think it’s really interesting, since we just built the Gates building on campus with the donation from Gates and Hillman [Foundation]. Our campus is really diverse with Google and Microsoft both being active here,” said first-year CIT student Bianka Roy.
“I think it’s really neat,” said first-year business administration major Emily Lee. 
“Obviously, right now, people like Google better and don’t really know what Bing is, but I feel like, with the  developer being a CMU grad, it could get really big on campus. If I  had known Bing was by a CMU grad, I would probably use it.” 
Microsoft and Lu will face years of work in developing the Bing search engine, but according to his mentors, Lu is more than capable of that task. 
“He is one of the most driven people I have ever known, and his determination to make Bing a success is remarkable,” said Randal Bryant, dean of the School of Computer Science.

Carnegie Mellon professors were big winners with Google last Tuesday, receiving three of Google’s 12 first-ever Focused Research Awards. The awards totaled $5.7 million, of which Carnegie Mellon professors received $2 million in funding. The grants are unrestricted, set to last for two to three years, and come with access to all of Google’s technologies. 
The three winning Carnegie Mellon research teams were all awarded funding for different areas of specialization. Google has identified machine learning, privacy, use of mobile phones as data collection devices, and energy efficient computing as four areas in which the company is interestied in encouraging new research.
Tom Mitchell, head of the machine learning department; William Cohen, associate research professor in machine learning; and Christos Faloutsos and Garth Gibson, both professors of computer science, were awarded $1 million over two years for their plans to create the world’s largest Internet database. The grant comes with a possibility of an extra $500,000 toward the end of their project, after a review.
The team plans to extract as many as 25 million facts from the Internet to contextualize in their database.
“The long-term goal of this work is to collect large amounts of ‘common sense’ information from the web and make it available. Hopefully this will impact how people build intelligent programs in the future,” Cohen said.
The team hopes that their database will return answers to broad research questions such as “Who is the most famous person related to CMU?” and “Which location in Pennsylvania stands out from the rest and why?” according to Faloutsos.
While Faloutsos and his team focused on searching the Internet, another Carnegie Mellon group zeroed in on Internet privacy concerns. 
Lorrie Cranor, associate professor of computer science and engineering and public policy; Norman Sadeh, professor of computer science; and Alessandro Acquisti, associate professor of information technology in the Heinz College received $400,000 for their work on Internet privacy.
“We’re hoping to gain important insights into privacy-related behavior and develop tools that will provide ‘nudges’ to help people protect their privacy,” Cranor said.
The grant combines three different areas of expertise on the part of all three professors, according to Sadeh.
“Lorrie has spent many years working on the Platform for Privacy Preferences and more recently on studying usability issues,” Sadeh said. “[Acquisti] has been studying behavioral biases in people in the context of security and privacy decision. My personal focus has been more on the development of technologies to empower users to more effectively specify complex privacy policies with a particular focus on mobile and social networking applications.”
The privacy study will integrate behavioral economics, human computer interaction, and artificial intelligence in nudging users toward privacy protection mechanisms.
While this team is promoting and investigating smart computing, the third group of Carnegie Mellon professors is looking at the physical computers themselves.
David Andersen and Mor Harchol-Balter, associate professors of computer science have received $100,000 to continue their work on creating energy-efficient computer clusters.
Andersen spoke very positively about working with Google. “We received initial feedback within two weeks of submitting the grant, and notification of the award within a month. It’s the fastest grant turn-around I’ve ever experienced. We really enjoyed it,” he said. “We’ve both worked with Google engineers in the past, and we’re glad to be able to continue doing so.”
The team plans to use Harchol-Balter’s experience in queuing theory and Andersen’s past systems research to address the scaling problems related to creating more energy-efficient clusters.
“Datacenter energy efficiency is hugely important, whether you measure the impact in the green of dollars or the green of the environment,” Andersen said. “Happily, it’s one of those areas where you get both of them: reduced costs and reduced environmental impact.”
Andersen, Harchol-Balter, and the other professors receiving awards will have the opportunity to work with Google in the coming years.
This research grant program is one of Google’s many outreach programs, which include over 150 research grants and a Graduate Fellowship Program started just last year for graduate students doing specialized research.

The department of biological sciences has named Nathan N. Urban as its new head. Urban, who in 2005 was named one of the country’s top 50 science and technology innovators by Scientific American, succeeds John Woolford, who has served as acting department head since the death of Elizabeth Jones in June 2008.
Urban has been a member of the department’s faculty since 2002. He conducts neurobiological research on campus, focusing primarily on the olfactory system, which controls the body’s sense of smell. Urban’s research is done on the molecular and cellular levels and aims to discover how neurons interact within the system.
Besides being named as one of the top innovators in 2005, Urban has received additional awards, including, most recently, the Association for Chemoreception Sciences 2009 Young Investigator Award and the 2007 Polak Young Investigator Award. Other awards and honors include Carnegie Mellon’s Eberly Family Career Development Professorship in the Biological Sciences and the Human Frontiers in Science Young Investigator’s Award. 
Urban received his bachelor’s degree in neuroscience from the University of Pittsburgh before becoming a Rhodes scholar at Oxford and, later, earning a doctorate in neuroscience from the University of Pittsburgh.
Carnegie Mellon senior chemistry major and science and humanities scholar Swati Varshney has been awarded the Churchill Scholarship, which grants her funding for a year of post-graduate study at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Varshney is one of only 14 students nationwide to receive this award.
Varshney plans to obtain her master’s degree in micro- and nanotechnology enterprise at the university next year. This degree will blend business and science, something that Varshney has done in the past while working at Plextronics, an international technology company founded by Rick McCullough, Carnegie Mellon’s vice president of research.
On campus, Varshney has participated in the Chemistry Student Advisory Council and the Women’s Leadership Institute.
After using the Churchill scholarship to obtain her master’s at the University of Cambridge, Varshney intends to return to the United States to pursue a Ph.D. in chemistry, focusing on polymeric biomaterials and materials science.
Vashney also recently received the nationally competitive Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship, which helps students to pursue careers in the sciences.

When Einstein Came to Town
Today at 4:30 p.m.
Kresge Auditorium
(College of Fine Arts)
In December of 1934, almost exactly 75 years ago, Albert Einstein arrived at Carnegie Mellon (at the time, Carnegie Tech) to deliver what is now regarded as one of the most famous lectures of all time. Einstein came to Pittsburgh as the highlight of an important four-day scientific conference. Einstein’s lecture came at the height of his fame. He was undoubtedly a celebrity coming to Pittsburgh; he was on the front page of the newpaper and interviewed by several reporters.
For his lecture in Kresge Auditorium, 1000 people crammed into a room made for 400. It was history in the making: Einstein explained his derivation of the legendary equation, E = mc2. 75 years later, David Topper, a University of Winnipeg professor, will put on a presentation that will take us back three-quarters of a century via pictures and documents to Einstein’s historic Pittsburgh visit.
Uncertainty In Action
Wednesday, Feb. 17 
at 4:30 p.m.
Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)
Joseph “Jay” B. Kadane, instructor and academic administrator at Carnegie Mellon, will discuss how uncertainty is a common aspect of everyone’s life. Kadane has focused his teachings on making good decisions while dealing with uncertainty. He will speak about his personal and professional encounters with uncertainty. 
Professionally, Kadane found that he had to set aside some two-thirds of what he learned as a graduate student because it no longer made sense to him. Personally, he has used his increasing sense of uncertainty in his work as a student activist in graduate school and as a strategic planner in the Navy.
Genes, Germs and the Environment: An Ecological Perspective on Health and Disease
Thursday, Feb. 18 
at 4:30 p.m.
Gregg Hall 
(Porter Hall 100) 
John McLachlan, Weatherhead Distinguished Professor of Environmental Studies, professor of pharmacology, and director of the Center for Bioenvironmental Research at Tulane University and Xavier University, is a pioneer in the emerging field of environmental endocrinology, dealing with endocrine-disrupting chemicals. 
McLachlan, a research scientist and high-level administrator, is known worldwide as an expert on estrogenic mechanisms. His revolutionary research involves environmental chemicals that imitate estrogen, a hormone produced in females. With this research and discovery, McLachlan organized the first meeting regarding environmental estrogen in 1979. 
McLachlan spent 20 years at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, where he was named scientific director in 1989. 
He also holds an influential role in the  New Orleans community, having established the Program in the Environment and Women’s Health, the country’s first Center in Environmental Astrobiology, and having created the Mississippi River Interdisciplinary Research Program. 
McLachlan received a B.A. in liberal arts from the Johns Hopkins University and a Ph.D. in pharmacology from George Washington University.
Thursday’s lecture is part of the Environmental Distinguished Lecture Series, co-sponsored by the Institute for Green Science;  the Chemistry Department, the department of civil & environmental engineering; and the Shaw Group.

Hailing from the beautiful outskirts of Cleveland, Ohio, I’ve pretty much been raised to dislike and oppose all things Pittsburgh. From the sports teams to the rivers that, as far as I know, have never been on fire (lame), there seems to be nothing in this wreck of a city that I can like. So when the recent blizzard-esque storm wreaked havoc around town this past week, I just knew something would come out of it that would have me despising the city of Pittsburgh more than ever.
Now, at this point in my time here at Carnegie Mellon, I have experienced Pittsburgh winters three times, and the first two were nothing I had not seen before. I did notice last year, however, that Pittsburgh seemed to care little about its immediate suburbs — you know, where many of its residents live — and maintaining safe driving and walking conditions in those areas. But for the most part it wasn’t too bad, and I attributed some of the awful conditions near the road to college students who don’t shovel the sidewalks in front of their houses on Beeler and in other residences near campus.
Then last week happened, and the crazy-meter shot through the roof with school being canceled, cars getting stuck in the middle of the road, and the hilarious antics of people attempting to get up the hill near Forbes and Morewood. As someone who drives in Pittsburgh now, the conditions of late are worse than any I have experienced in my life. The main question I keep hearing asked by myself and others is simply, “What was the city thinking this whole time?” It was clear that a storm was coming and double-digit inches of snow were expected. Yet the lack of plows around town was astonishing. I even talked to one of the half-dozen plow operators I saw who told me, “I’m not a professional; I really don’t know what I’m doing, just trying to get snow off the road.” And while it is sometimes that simple, how is it that a city that routinely experiences snow for multiple months out of the year does not have a veritable fleet of plows, not to mention an organized plan for which locations are most important to keep cleared?
And do not think for a second that Pittsburgh deserves less blame due to the magnitude of the snowfall, because exactly two years ago, on Feb. 16, 2008, Mayor Luke Ravenstahl said in a press conference that he was disappointed in the snow removal job done by the city, vowed to inventory public works vehicles, and overall to do a better job of removing snow and ice from the streets. And just look at that, a vow from a politician who had two full years to do anything he proposed at the time, including putting plows on garbage trucks and other city machinery, and yet failed at every single possible avenue. Instead, the mayor spent his time trying to get a little extra dough from us students, who clearly are not pulling our weight in this city. I guess we should have shoveled our sidewalks more.

The political climate in Iran has been tense since last June’s election, and government security has been even tighter surrounding the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. However, Iran took its safety measures to a whole new level last week. In response to threats about the opposition staging mass protests on last Thursday’s holiday, the Iranian government took extraordinary steps, including shutting down citizens’ access to Gmail, aiming to replace the ubiquitous e-mail service with a nationalized — and obviously closely monitored — e-mail service. Furthermore, the government removed satellite dishes from residential homes, severely restricting outside communication.
This is hardly the first of time the Iranian government has taken authoritarian actions. Prior to this, the government had been ruthlessly imprisoning people and even sentencing them to death for protesting the results of last year’s allegedly rigged election. The government has also been cracking down on activists, as if to root out all opposition by ruling with an iron fist. 
The news of the Iranian government’s oppressive measures is outrageous. It is shocking and saddening to us that today, a time in which democracy is a prevalent and popular idea, dictatorships still have power. What’s more, the government is stripping Iranians of their means to fight back — be it their jobs, their e-mail service, or their lives. The citizens are being threatened from every direction.
While shutting down Gmail may be successful in cutting communication among protesters, and between them and the outside world, it is hardly a sensible course of action. By revoking the Iranians’ access to communication channels, the government has violated not just their freedom of choice, but has also curbed their freedom of speech. These are basic human rights: privileges that belong to every individual and should, under no circumstance, be revoked. 
We greatly disapprove of the Iranian government’s course of action, not just because of the violence that it perpetuates against opponents, but also because of the inequality behind its actions.

Childhood obesity is a problem. 
The big question lies in how to solve this particular problem, which seems to be growing worse as time passes.
Some people, including the current administration, think the solution is to remove all junk food from schools. According to a recent New York Times article, legislation will soon be introduced to do just that.
While a healthy diet is essential for preventing weight-related health problems, banning junk food is not the best way to solve this problem. Instead, the government should focus on encouraging a healthy lifestyle through choices, not mandates.
Banning junk food in schools would force children to eat well during the school day, but there’s nothing to stop them from eating whatever they want at home, as long as it’s something their parents would allow. As in most matters concerning children, parents should have more control than the government. What a child eats or does not eat is something for his or her parents to decide.
In addition, banning junk food would target the wrong age group. In elementary school, it is rare to find regular offerings of french fries and candy, whereas in high school it is common.
While it is important to encourage children of all ages to make healthy dietary choices, by the time students are in high school, they are probably already suffering as a result of a poor diet. Childhood obesity starts well before high school, and as a result, the government should focus its efforts on teaching elementary school-aged students to live healthy lives.
Instead of instituting a ban on all things that are not nutritious, schools should teach students to make healthy choices. Schools are already required to offer health and physical education classes throughout the course of a child’s education. With reforms to these curricula, students will be more likely to lead healthy lifestyles not just inside school but also throughout their lives.
Physical education classes often revolve around learning the rules of sports, and at least in my school, there was very little exercise involved. If schools instead taught students exercises they could do individually or sports like tennis where only one partner is needed, students would be more likely to exercise outside of class. The rules of basketball and football are interesting to some people, but for most students, they’ll never be useful.
Health programs could also be reformed to fit today’s needs. Since the concern here is to try to stop childhood obesity, health classes could be targeted toward that end. Rather than spending a great deal of time on communicable diseases and reproductive health, teachers could focus on nutrition. From a young age, children can learn to make healthier choices if they understand why they should. By making healthy food appealing and fun, which is entirely possible at the elementary school age, schools will encourage children to eat better without forcing them to do so.
However, while these reforms would play a huge part in reducing or eliminating childhood obesity, unless parents step in and continue where the schools leave off, nothing will change. Parents are responsible for their children 100 percent of the time, including while they are at school. If parents choose to allow their children to buy lunch, especially in elementary school, it allows the children to make their own decisions about what to eat before they are fully aware of how to make healthy choices.
Instead of buying lunch, parents should pack lunches when they can, making sure to include items from each food group. By showing their children that they not only care about what they eat, but also that they want them to eat healthy foods, parents can aid their children in making smarter choices. In addition, parents have more control over how the food is presented, and if presented in a fun way (for example, celery sticks filled with peanut butter and raisins), healthy food choices can be just as appealing as unhealthy ones.
Parents’ responsibilities don’t end with lunch, though. Healthy, home-cooked meals eaten together will also encourage children to eat well. By showing the child that food — good food — is a priority, he or she will see that food choices are important. 
Ending the reliance on prepared foods and takeout will benefit children and help to reduce the likelihood of childhood obesity.
If parents and schools work together to improve the health of children and encourage a healthy lifestyle, including both a nutritious diet and regular exercise, children will be less likely to have weight problems and more likely to have better self-esteem.
A government ban on junk food in schools would not be as effective and should be avoided in favor of a plan that focuses instead on teaching children to make healthy choices.

We live in extraordinary times.
Last week, for the first time since 2003, Carnegie Mellon University canceled classes due to snow. Campus was closed for three days due to weather for perhaps the first time in its 110-year history. These snow-related closings and cancellations inconvenienced students and professors, administration and staff alike. Tests, lectures, and assignments must be rescheduled, syllabi must be rearranged, and we all must return to our normal, blizzard-free lives.
Yet despite the interruption to our routine, we applaud the university administration for demonstrating its commitment to the safety of its students and employees by complying with the city’s request to cancel classes. 
At a school where missing a single day can take a week to make up, closing the campus is not an easy choice. But the cost of missed classes is much less than that of broken bones or car accidents. Rather than putting pressure on faculty to brave the dangerous roads or on students to walk down icy paths, the university made the responsible choice to accept the reality of the city’s situation.
It was not Carnegie Mellon’s fault that Pittsburgh received almost 30 inches of snow in six days or that the city was woefully underprepared for such a storm. In fact, the university’s response was faster and more effective than the city’s: By Wednesday morning, sidewalks across the Cut were clear, while Forbes Avenue remained a sheet of ice. The school’s leaders made the right choice in closing offices, not because campus was impassable, but for the well-being of staff and students living off campus.
While Snowmageddon 2010 has come to an end, we commend the actions of an administration that rightly places the safety of its community as a top priority.

Last week, the depths of the Internet birthed a new social-media love child which the Interweb denizens and the falling-out-of-fashion blogosphere met with a collective: “Um, what?”
Google’s Buzz is a Twitter/Flickr/Picasa/Google Reader mash-up that has parasitically taken up residence inside your Gmail account. Yes, it is one more Internet life-stream, pulling in information that you have deposited around the Web in one place for all of your Googly friends to read. And this is not a Google Labs feature that only the most hardcore of geeks will test out — this is something that is being rolled out across the entire Google digisphere. And with Google putting all their weight behind it, it is a service to consider very seriously. The buzz is here: the best thing you never wanted.
Enabling your Gmail account with Buzz is ultra-simple. If you haven’t yet begun your Buzz, the next time you log in to your Gmail account, an intro screen will block you with a welcome to the service. Regardless of which selection you make, either “Sweet! Check out Buzz” or “Nah, go to my inbox,” Buzz is activated. Yes, that’s right: Both options turn on Buzz. That’s what they must mean by “no setup needed.”
Activation is idiot-proof, continuing the simplicity-first Google design aesthetic (if you are willing to call it that) that spans nearly all of their products. Setting up which feeds you want to pull is as easy as clicking an “Add” button. Add Flickr with your Flickr account name; add Twitter with your Twitter account name. Want to load in posts from your blog? Not allowed. Want to load in your Facebook status updates? Not allowed.
Google is taking the control and the privacy settings out of your hands. You might ask: Is privacy a concern on Buzz? It is just pulling in your feeds from other places, already accessible. But all of this content being pulled in is being read by... whom, exactly? In a gesture of kindness, Google Buzz helps you get started by computing your core social network from your Gmail account and automatically having you follow them publicly on Buzz. Ever had an e-mail conversation with someone that you didn’t want the whole world to know you were talking to? Oh well, now they do.
Google is responding quickly. The product launched on Tuesday, and by Thursday they had already officially (via blog) addressed the concerns and rolled out a first set of changes — changes which are a good step, but are only a rudimentary start already two days too late.
More importantly, we should think about our ever-shifting Internet presence. When I now update my “status,” do I do it on Twitter, on Facebook, on Buzz? Do I want to tell my Twitter followers the same things I tell Facebook? Are my accounts protected? Do I want Buzz to know everything I tell everyone? According to Google, there were over 9 million posts on Buzz, but certainly the great majority of Buzz information wasn’t created with Buzz; it was imported.
Tim Maly has begun an effort called Unlink Your Feeds, a “call for sanity” from the new trend of dumping all your content from one site to another and beyond. This is a brilliant effort to solve a serious problem that Buzz is only exaggerating.
Google, in its lack of anything near real time, is trying to jump in to have its own version of Facebook status, its own tweets. The buzz is just one new real-time noise among many. But worse, it currently consists of repetitive content chained across the Internet. This is the future death of current social networks, when all of the content is stale, made for a different group on a different network. Any sort of personal touch is lost and we are left with just echoes across the wires.
Patrick Gage Kelley (pkelley@) is trying to hear harmonies in the internoise.

I actively participate in fantasy sports. Maybe it’s to make up for the fact that I don’t vote in local elections, haven’t watched every episode of Jersey Shore, and regretfully let my team down in IM co-rec badminton. (Sorry, Ben.) Fantasy sports are my way of engaging in representative popular culture in a competitive format. Either that, or getting excellent training in becoming a bookie.
I convinced a few fine young first-year gentlemen to register for fantasy figure skating in light of the Olympic year, and in exchange I registered for the official NFL Fantasy Football Playoff Challenge. Early signs of bitter competition quickly appeared: On the eve of 2010, instead of wishing me a happy new year, my friend Jason ominously declared, “This is the year I defeat you in fantasy figure skating.” I’ve never felt so threatened.
Fantasy figure skating works somewhat differently from fantasy football. Skaters in each competition are divided into three broad categories based on international rankings. You pick your presumed best in each category, considering factors such as the specific competition, time of year, technical ability, artistic ability, nerves, and number of sequins on costume. You do this for ladies’, men’s, pairs, and ice dancing. Based on these selections, you are ranked among all other players for each competition. Considering that there are around seven or eight rounds of this before the Olympics, fantasy figure skating is more than your average laughable pastime — it’s one hell of a full-out endurance-based competition.
The process is so complicated that a friend who knew a decent amount about logic, probability, and programming offered to write a program that would weigh in all these options and generate the optimal selections for each competition, thereby helping me to my victory. I was thrilled. However, after hearing that he had to factor in sequins and density of makeup, he abandoned me and my endeavor to do more “serious” things, such as working on his Area of Effect in World of Warcraft.
I asked some of the guys what their strategies for picking obscure figure skaters were. Peter mulled over his online ballot and pulled up a world map in a new tab, proclaiming that he was going to pick skaters from countries that were the closest to the equator. Dave resigned himself to picking skaters with the weirdest names, adding Ari-Pekka Nurmenkari and Rockne Brubaker to the mix. Adam Wikipedia-ed pictures and essentially picked the hottest ones.
“Yeahhh, Sasha Cohen!”
Jason, my biggest threat, picked singles actually based on international rankings. He picked pairs and ice dancing based on if he thought they would make a good couple or not.
“You know what they say,” Jason said. “The team that skates together...”
“Okay!” I countered. “Do you want to hear how I picked my NFL team?”
Not being big on statistics, I picked players based on how much they smiled. I started with a snickering Tony Romo and worked my way up to a beaming Larry Fitzgerald, who turned out to be a good choice because he eventually earned me 20 points in Round 1. Shonn Greene and Cedric Benson also made it on, along with their pearly whites. My team of Crest WhiteStrips models was ready to go.
A few weeks later, after the national championships that served as Olympic trials for figure skating and the Round 1 “Wild Card” for football had ended, we met up to compare. My smiling football boys totaled up to 110 points, well above Jason’s 97 and Adam’s 67. I was ecstatic.
For figure skating nationals, however, I had typically over-analyzed and ended up in a dismal 333rd place. Meanwhile, using his piece-by-piece strategy, Jason tied for 25th place.
“Like a BAWSS!” he declared.
At this point in my education, I was relieved to finally find out how the world really works. Having no knowledge can undeniably be your best strategy. Knowing this now, I threw in the towel and started randomly pointing at my computer screen for my Olympic picks. It might be my best bet.

Eight days ago, on Super Bowl Sunday, prime-time football got political. 
CBS, the television station that presented the game on Feb. 7, chose to air a pro-life advertisement from anti-abortion interest group Focus on the Family featuring Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow and his mother Pam, and rejected a commercial from gay male dating site Mancrunch.
The Super Bowl is consistently the biggest advertising event of the year, even with the Winter Olympics closely following the football event. In choosing to air one controversial commercial over another one, CBS politicized the Super Bowl and shut out a significant portion of its audience, whether or not it intended to do so.
Most of the Super Bowl ads are seemingly chosen to appeal to a mass audience of about 100 million viewers. We see in the rest of the commercial planning — ads filled with appeals to nostalgia with classic athletes, such as Charles Barkley, or celebrities famous across multiple generations, such as Betty White — an attempt to appeal to everyone watching the big game. 
Thus it seems out of character to air a political, staunchly pro-life commercial, particularly one with a message obscured by Tebow.
We recognize that CBS can run whatever commercials it wants; it has the right to be selective. But while this is true, CBS has a responsibility not to discriminate or run misleading ads, especially during such a big event that reaches Americans of so many disparate generations.
Moreover, CBS is suffering from a lack of transparency following its lack of judgment. All statements its executives have made to major media outlets about the decision have seemed terse and vague. For example, Jo Ann Ross, president of sales for CBS, told Reuters, “There’s still a lot to be said for live events that garner general interest.”
Even if the Mancrunch ad were inappropriate for prime-time football, as CBS appears to have deemed it, the network has a responsibility to its viewers to clearly explain why that potentially controversial commercial was any less suitable for the American public than the politically charged one from Focus on the Family.

The Society of Women Engineers (SWE) takes the opportunity every February to collaborate with several groups across campus to celebrate the success and hard work of engineers. This year, National Engineering Week (E-Week) will be held Feb. 12–20, with the main theme being “Engineering through the Ages.”
The goals of these events are to emphasize the development and growth of engineering through the years, show how interdisciplinary teams work together to solve problems, and demonstrate the many ways in which engineering impacts our lives and the lives of people around the world. 
In addition, the events aim to engage the campus community with engineers and their projects. By doing so we hope to excite, educate, and encourage others to explore and develop a greater understanding and appreciation for engineering.
E-Week events are scheduled for each day this week. These include exhibitions like the tech showcase and ice cream social Monday night and the design competition Thursday afternoon. There are social events, like the Engineering Carnival this past weekend, the Dinner with 19 Tartans this Thursday night, and the first-year networking event Wednesday night. E-Week concludes with the Mr. Engineer competition Friday night in Rangos Hall.
Each of these events is open to the entire campus. Events include free food as well as several prizes donated by Microsoft to be raffled off. A full schedule, as well as explanations of each event, can be found at www.cmu.edu/swe. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Christine Anderson (clanders@) or Cat Hartzell (chartzel@).
Along with engineering organizations, additional sponsors include Schlumberger, Microsoft, Apple, SDC, Gelfand Center, CIT Dean’s Office, and the Alumni Association. We would like to thank the campus community in advance for their support of E-Week.
