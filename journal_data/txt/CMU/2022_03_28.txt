On March 25 and 26, the Carnegie Mellon Track and Field teams hosted the Carnegie Mellon Invitational to a variety of Division I, II, and III colleges.
Men’s Track and Field
The Men’s Track and Field team had a strong showing at their invitational. Junior Elijah Sech and sophomore David Durdaller took first and second place, respectively, in the 3,000-meter steeplechase with times of 9:40.58 and 9:42.16. Both earned personal-best times in the event.
The Carnegie Mellon men also performed exceptionally well in the 3,000-meter run, with the first-year trio of Colin McLaughlin, Aleksei Seletskiy, and Eamon Brady taking the top three spots with times of 8:42.22, 8:51.54, and 8:54.47, respectively.
In the 1,500-meter run, senior Michael OBroin took first with a personal best time of 3:58.20; sophomore Alex Ivanov took fifth in the race with a time of 4:04.26. Ivanov also placed third in the 800-meter race with a time of 1:59.20; sophomore Jackson Wood placed right behind him with a time of 1:59.60.
The Tartans also performed well in some of the shorter distance running events. In the 400-meter dash, junior Alexander Halkias placed third just ahead of sophomore Pranav Rajbhandari. Halkias had a time of 50.74 and Rajbhandari finished with a time of 51.03. Sophomore Andrew McGovern performed in the 400-meter hurdles, finishing second with a time of 56.74.
First-year Casey Potrebic took first in the pole vault, clearing the bar at 4.15 meters. He was the only competitor to record a height in the event. In the long jump, senior Justin Kiefel took first place with a mark of 7.06 meters, 0.37 meters better than the next competitor. Sophomore Thomas Rich also performed well in the event, earning fourth with a jump of 6.48 meters. Kiefel also took first place in the triple jump with a 14.39-meter jump. First-year Luke Blackwell placed right behind him with a mark of 13.79 meters.
Graduate student Bram Miller set a new stadium record in the shot put with a throw of 17.61 meters, earning him first place by a wide margin. Miller also took first in the discus with a mark of 51.38 meters, which is just short of his 51.79 meter school record set in 2019. Also in the discus, junior Len Huang got a personal-best throw of 45.15 meters, earning third place. First-year Cody Breidenbach took home second in the hammer throw with a distance of 49.55 meters. Behind him, Junior Bailey O’Malley took fourth with a throw of 46.07 meters.
Women’s Track and Field
The Women’s Track and Field team also had a very strong showing at the Carnegie Mellon Invitational. Graduate student Kendra Noneman set a new school record in the hammer throw, winning the event with a throw of 60.15 meters. This breaks the 55.42-meter record that she set last week. Junior Liz Barre also set a school record in the high jump when she cleared 1.63 meters, taking second in the event. Barre also performed well in the 100-meter hurdles, taking first with a time of 15.82, over a full second faster than second place.
In the 400-meter hurdles, junior Carmen Andrade took third place with a time of 1:11.48. In the longer distance scale, senior Kristen Seballos took third in the 5,000-meter run with a personal best time of 17:54.61. Behind her was senior Michelle Murray in fourth place with a time of 18:08.42.
First-year Jolie Wasserman also took third in the javelin throw with a mark of 27.03 meters. Additionally, sophomore Jo-Michelle Huczko tied for first in the pole vault with a height of 3.20 meters.
Both teams will be competing at the Dave Labor Invitational at Slippery Rock University next Saturday, April 2. Their next home meet will be on April 14, when they will compete at the Carnegie Mellon Mid-Week Meet.

The 2022 World Figure Skating Championships, held in Montpellier, France, concluded last week. With Russian athletes, including the 3 A’s (Anna Shcherbakova, Alena Kostornaia, and Alexandra Trusova) and Kamila Valieva — previous favorites for the women’s singles — banned from the competition and men’s singles favorites Yuzuru Hanyu and Nathan Chen out of the competition due to injury, the competition was particularly interesting this year for both viewers and athletes alike.
In men’s singles, Japan started particularly strong, sweeping the podium in the short program. Olympic bronze medalist Shoma Uno led the field, putting up a total segment score of 109.63, outscoring his previous personal best, set last month during the 2022 Beijing Olympics, by nearly four points. Olympic silver medalist Yuma Kagiyama finished just behind, having stumbled during his triple Axel and placing second with a score of 105.69. Kazuki Tomono, having scored a total segment score of 101.12, also bested his previous personal best by nearly four points, placing third after the short program. Ilia Malinin of the United States, Daniel Grassl of Italy, and Vincent Zhou, also of the United States, trailed behind the podium with scores of 100.16, 97.62, and 95.84, respectively.
Both Uno and Kagiyama continued their dominance in the free skate. Although Uno stumbled after an underrotated quad flip, he performed the rest of his program excellently, putting up a total segment score of 202.85 — nearly 10 points over his previous personal best — and securing the gold medal in men’s singles with a personal best combined score of 312.48. Kagiyama’s free skate program began with some trouble, when his second jump, a quad toe-loop, was downgraded and received overwhelmingly negative grade of execution (GOE) scores as a result. However, The 2022 World Figure Skating Championships, held in Montpellier, France, concluded last week.

Both Uno and Kagiyama continued their dominance in the free skate. Although Uno stumbled after an underrotated quad flip, he performed the rest of his program excellently, putting up a total segment score of 202.85 — nearly 10 points over his previous personal best — and securing the gold medal in men’s singles with a personal best combined score of 312.48. Kagiyama’s free skate program began with some trouble, when his second jump, a quad toe-loop, was downgraded and received overwhelmingly negative grade of execution (GOE) scores as a result. However, Kagiyama rallied and completed the rest of his program reasonably well, scoring 191.91 for his free skate for a combined score of 297.60. Camden Pulkinen of the United States, who had placed 12th after the short program with a score of 89.50, put on a greatly improved performance in the free skate to place third in the segment with a new personal best score of 182.19 for a combined score of 271.69. Fellow American Vincent Zhou, Georgian Morisi Kvitelashvili, and Adam Siao Him Fa of France trailed behind the podium in free skate with scores of 181.54, 179.42, and 175.15, respectively.
With two rounds of dominance, Uno and Kagiyama’s gold and silver men’s singles medals were never in contention. Uno’s victory makes him the first man other than Hanyu and Chen to win the men’s singles World Championships since 2017. With Kagiyama taking silver in men’s singles, Japanese athletes have won silver in the event in each of the last eight World Championships. The competition for the bronze medal, however, was much less predictable. Although Tomono was third after the short program, several mistakes during his free skate resulted in him finishing eight in the segment and off the overall podium. Both Malinin and Grassl finished similarly, having placed 11th and seventh in the segment, respectively, resulting in them finishing ninth and seventh overall, respectively. Despite Pulkinen finishing third in the free skate, his 12th place short program score was not enough to help him make the men’s singles podium, and he placed fifth overall. With a combined score of 277.38, it was Vincent Zhou who performed consistently enough across both segments to take the men’s singles bronze.
In women’s singles, it was Olympic bronze medalist Kaori Sakamoto who led the field after the short program, scoring a new personal best of 80.32 points. Belgian Loena Hendrickx trailed closely behind, placing second with a total segment score of 75.00. American Mariah Bell took third in the short program, underrotating her first jump but having no other significant issues in her program and thus scoring a personal best of 72.55 points for the segment. Young You of Korea, Alysa Liu of the U.S., and Nicole Schott of Germany finished just off the podium with scores of 72.08, 71.91, and 67.77, respectively.
Sakamoto’s kept up her momentum in the next segment, blowing the rest of the field out of the water with a fantastically executed program that earned her a personal best free skate score of 155.77 and a corresponding personal best combined score of 236.09. Although Hendrickx underrotated two of her jumps — a triple-Lutz triple-toe loop combination and a triple-Lutz double-toe loop combination — she skated well through the rest of her program to score 142.70 for the segment, placing second, and scoring 217.70 overall. American Alysa Liu took third with a total segment score of 139.28, having similarly had two instances of underrotation, and put up an overall combined score of 211.19. Fellow American Mariah Bell, as well as Georgian Anastasia Gubanova and Young You and Korea followed closely behind, scoring 136.11, 134.02, and 132.83 for the free skate segment, respectively.
Like men’s singles, there was little contention over the gold and silver medals for women’s singles. Having won both the short program and the free skate, Sakamoto finished in first place, over 15 points ahead of Hendrickx. Hendrickx held her ground against the rest of the field, finishing second in both segments of the event to secure the silver medal. Although she was sitting in fifth after the short program, Liu’s third-place performance in the free skate was enough for her to surpass Bell, with Liu taking the bronze medal for the event and Bell finishing in fourth place overall.
The United States performed well in the pairs short program, taking both first and second place. Americans Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier edged out teammates Ashley Cain-Gribble and Timothy LeDuc, with the former scoring a personal best of 76.88 points to edge out the latter’s segment score of 75.85. Japanese pair Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara placed third, scoring 71.58 after a fall on their triple Lutz throw. Karina Safina and Luka Berulava of Georgia, Vanessa James and Eric Radford of Canada, and Minerva Fabienne Hase Nolan Seegert of Germany finished just off the podium, having scored 67.36, 66.54, and 66.29 points, respectively.
Knierim and Frazier continued their momentum in the free skate, putting up a total segment score of 144.21, beating their previous personal best by nearly six points, and an overall new personal best score of 221.09. James and Radford rallied to a strong third-place showing, scoring 130.78 for a combined personal best score of 197.32. Miura and Kihara held firmly onto third place, scoring 127.97 points for the segment for a combined overall score of 199.55 overall. Safina and Luka Berulava, Hase and Seegert, and Canadians Evelyn Walsh and Trennt Michaud followed the podium, having scored 124.38, 123.32, and 115.74 for the free skate segment, respectively.
Knierim and Frazier took gold in the event in stride, finishing first in the short program and first again, comfortably, in the free skate. Fellow Americans Cain-Gribble and LeDuc, however, were not quite as fortunate. Although they were in second place after the free skate, a series of falls culminating in Cain-Gribble hitting her head on the ice and suffering a concussion forced the pair to withdraw from the competition. Silver went to Miura and Kihara, whose consistency allowed them to reach the podium in both the short program and the free skate. Despite being fifth after the short program, James and Radford’s second-place free skate program earned them the bronze medal in the event overall.
Having taken gold in ice dance at the Beijing Olympics back in February, French pair Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron showcased their prowess in the rhythm dance, scoring a historic 92.73 with no GOE scores less than three. This score bested their previous personal best score — the previous rhythm dance world record — by nearly two points. American pair and Olympic bronze medalists Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue also performed exceptionally well, but could not match the French, taking second place with a personal best segment score of 89.72. Teammates Madison Chock and Evan Bates finished third in the rhythm dance, scoring 87.51. Italians Charlene Guignard and Marco Fabbri, Canadians Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier, and Spaniards Olivia Smart and Adrian Diaz followed just behind the podium, with scores of 84.22, 80.79, and 79.40, respectively.
The podium remained constant in the free dance. Papadakis and Cizeron continued their dominance, finishing in first place, scoring 137.09, beating their previous personal best and setting a new world record for the free dance segment. Their combined score of 229.82 was also a new personal best for the athletes, as well as a new world record. Hubbell and Donohue held onto second place, putting up a personal best score of 132.67 for the segment for a combined score of 222.39. Chock and Bates did not relent either, skating strong and scoring 129.32 for their free dance, earning a personal best combined score of 216.83. Guignard and Fabbri, Gilles and Poirier, and British pair Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson trailed behind, having scored 125.70, 121.91, and 119.28 for the segment, respectively.
With the consistency in placings across both segments of the event, especially among the teams on the podium, the overall placings came as no surprise. Papadakis and Cizeron took home their fifth World Championship gold medal, Hubbell and Donohue won their third World Championship silver, and Chock and Bates their second World Championship bronze.

‘Kirby and the Forgotten Land’ releases to positive reviews
On Friday, March 25, Nintendo published the latest entry in one of their capstone series, “Kirby and the Forgotten Land.” The game was developed to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the “Kirby” series and is the first 3D game in the series. 
The main premise of the game is that Kirby, the pink main character, finds himself on an abandoned island where he must save the trapped Waddle Dees, staple characters in the series. Once again, Kirby can copy enemy abilities and the game introduces two new ones: drill and ranger. There is also an upgrade system to copy abilities, which did not appear in previous entries to the series. Additionally, “Kirby and the Forgotten Land” introduces “Mouthful Mode”; with this addition, Kirby can swallow and manipulate large overworld objects such as pipes, cars, and scissor lifts. 
On the score aggregator Metacritic, the game received a score of 84 of 100 from critics and an 8.8 out of 10 from user reviews. Comparatively, the last Kirby game, “Kirby Star Allies,” received a score of 73 on Metacritic. PC Games notes, “In some places, it is breathtakingly beautiful, while in others, it is just cute, silly fun,” in their 90 rating of the game. Many critics have said it is one of the best entries in the franchise so far.
CD Projekt RED announces new ‘Witcher’ game
On March 21 via the Witcher Twitter profile, CD Projekt RED announced a new entry to the Witcher series with a graphic stating “A New Saga Begins.” From a release on “The Witcher” website, they announced that the company would be moving from REDengine, CD Projekt Red’s own game development engine, to Unreal Engine 5, which is developed by Epic Games, in a “multi-year strategic partnership with Epic Games” for this new project. Notably, REDengine was used in one of CD Projekt RED’s most recent projects, “Cyberpunk 2077.” In the update, they note that the future expansion of Cyberpunk 2077 will still use REDengine.
CD Projekt RED stated they will be working closely with Epic Games’ developers so that the engine will be suitable for the open-world experience that “The Witcher” series has offered so far. They also stated that there are no further details on the game to come right now, such as a development time frame or release date. 
Humble ‘Stand with Ukraine’ Bundle raises over $20 million
From its launch on March 18 to its close on March 25, the Humble “Stand with Ukraine” Bundle raised almost $21 million toward four charities: Razom for Ukraine, International Rescue Committee, International Medical Corps, and Direct Relief. At the end of the campaign, a total of 473,882 bundles were sold. The bundle featured over 120 items with a total value of over $2,500. Some notable items included in the bundle were “Metro Exodus,” “Slay the Spire,” “Kerbal Space Program,” and all three “Amnesia” games, among others.
The donations from this game bundle are just one of many made to Ukraine since Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February. The itch.io “Bundle for Ukraine” featuring 998 items worth over $6,500 that sold for $10 raised $6.3 million, and companies like The Pokémon Company, Bandai Namco, Square Enix, and CD Projekt Red have also made donations in support of Ukraine.
‘Inscryption’ wins Game of the Year from IGF and GDCA
“Inscryption” won “Game of the Year” from the Independent Games Festival (IGF) and the Game Developers Choice Awards (GDCA) — the first game to have done so. Self-described as “an inky black card-based odyssey that blends the deckbuilding roguelike, escape-room style puzzles, and psychological horror into a blood-laced smoothie,” the game has received overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam so far.
The game, developed by Daniel Mullins Games (“Pony Island,” “The Hex”) and published by Devolver Digital (“Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,” “Enter the Gungeon”), is a metafictional game like “Pony Island” and involves fictional “found footage” of the experiences of a vlogger who finds a computer game called “Inscryption.” On March 17, Devolver Digital announced the “Kaycee’s Mod” expansion for Act I of “Inscryption” was officially available. “Kaycee’s Mod” is a free mini-expansion that elaborates on the deck-building roguelike portion of “Inscryption.”

While everyone else at the Tartan is huffing and faffing about because of the upcoming elections, us PILLBOX-chads are watching fun movies and criticizing them. Pretty fun, huh? We’ve got a bunch of great articles about movies for your guys, as well as various other oddities.
On Page 4, we have an article by PILLBOX co-editor Pria Dahiya about the currently ongoing film festival! You can check further dates for it in our events article.
On Page 8, Pria continues to dazzle with a masterful interview with the one and only Owen Bonk, a man currently exiled in Germany for non-tax related reasons. Their own personal “My Dinner with Andre” has for subject Charli XCX’s new album, Crash. Of course, truly knowledgeable popheads like me know that she is deep in her Witness era, and that she’ll keep flopping unless she releases another single with Icona Pop.
On Page 10, non PILLBOX editor Cole Schubert writes about “Boys State”, a 2020 movie about political LARP convention with a political legacy.
On Page 14 one of my top 3 favorite PILLBOX contributors contributes PILLBOX favorably to top my list. He loves movie critics, but he also hates them. And that’s what's so powerful about it. With luck they’ll read his article, and will stop being bad and become good.
On Page 17 one of my top 3 favorite PILLBOX contributors comes back with an article from the vaults. Originally written in 2022, Zivan writes a brilliant satire about those who care, those who don’t, and those who really don’t but also maybe do.
Page 18 has music.
As always, send any and all contributions for future issues our way - using our spiffy new contribution form, which can be found on the back of the magazine! XOXO

DON’T LOOK AWAY:
Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival
“Faces Behind the Mask”
Over the past three years, the world has folded in on itself. 
We have access to other worlds in a way we never have before. We can watch wars, protests, and politics play out minute by minute on the geopolitical stage from the comfort of our own homes. However, despite this unprecedented connectivity, we are isolated in a way that we never have been before. With the bans on international and even local travel, we can only see the day-to-day lives of those who live in our direct surroundings. While we very comfortably bear witness to the major events occurring abroad, the quotidian details of the individual lives living through these events remain hidden. 
"Faces Behind the Mask" is revealing the very human lives behind the “mask” of otherness. The importance of this theme is reflected best in the festival’s own words: “The masks we wear are integral to how we navigate life, and FACES BEHIND THE MASK seeks to explore the realities they conceal, the facades they represent, and ways we bear them. What masks do we wear, and are we aware of their presence? How do these masks change, day by day, hour by hour, person to person? How can we see through the mask, and get at what is in the dark? Through film, and the privileged perspective it gives us, the CMU IFF hopes to answer these questions and ask all of us to reflect on our own masks, and their role in our lives.”
The opening night reception for the festival was absolutely delightful. It featured a screening of Morocco's academy-award submission, "Casablanca Beats." Brimming with music, dance, love, and laughter, the film is a celebration of the lives and self-expression of a group of teenagers growing up in the Sidi Moumen suburb of Casablanca. These teenagers learn how to express themselves through rap, poetry, and dance. It features exuberant scenes of music and dance, in addition to intimate portraits of the teenagers' internal lives. Most fascinating is that all the characters in the film are real-life individuals playing themselves. Anas Basbousi, a Moroccan rapper and musician, plays the charismatic yet demanding teacher at the center of the film. All the teenagers play versions of themselves with their own names, versions of themselves that we can infer are not too far from real life.
Much care was taken to honor the screening, from catering by Ali Baba to the fantastic performance by Carnegie Mellon’s very own Helix Dance team as a prelude to the movie. These touches made the film all the more personal to our Pittsburgh community. The screening was followed by a Q&A session with the director, Nabil Ayouch, moderated by Dr. Nevine Abraham, a Carnegie Mellon professor of Arabic Studies. Ayouch’s film certainly stands on its own, but the conversation with him furthered the audience's understanding of the film's roots and context. 
Ayouch’s explanation of his artistic philosophy was particularly illuminating. “Where I am from, young people are encouraged to be part of the masses,” he said. “What I try to do with my films is show the importance of the individual and bring focus to the individual who stands out from the crowd.” This comment struck me in the context of our own country, considering the renewed discussions around individualism versus collectivization. I have heard from peers countless times how the reckless individualism of our society is detrimental to general wellbeing and a renewed focus on the collective might be a solution. Hearing from Ayouch, I realized the fundamental naivete understanding of the world in these binaries. 
Moroccan society differs drastically from American social norms. Compared to the lives of the teenagers profiled in this film, the minute problems that young people like me face seem inconsequential. It is a breath of fresh air to see a film about young people who do not possess an ounce of disillusionment, cynicism, or irony. Watching them pursue their dreams of freedom and artistic expression is inspiring. You can’t be ironic if you can’t even express yourself earnestly in the first place!
I agree with Ayouch's assertion that we need a renewed focus on the individual outside of the mass. We do. We need a focus on individuals, but individuals who are not ourselves. We need a focus on individuals who have nothing in common (at least, superficially) with ourselves, and rediscover our shared humanity. If I sound a bit hyperbolic, I apologize, but I am one of those curmudgeonly young folk who fervently believes in the power of public arts programming to transform communities.  
Many of us have grand ideas about the role of art in American society — but how many of us know what life is like for a teenage rapper growing up in a suburb of Casablanca? We are glued to our phones and television screens watching politicians pontificate the war in Ukraine — but how many of us have seen up-close what life is like in the trenches of the Donbas*? We experience our own fair share of strange weather here in Pittsburgh — but how is it comparable to a typhoon and its aftermath as explored in the Filipino drama “Whether the Weather is Fine”?
Despite Carnegie Mellon’s incredible art scene and cultural output, there is a divide between the “artistic” scenes and “non-artistic” scenes of our school. The International Film Festival (IFF) bridges this divide by making its programming as accessible as possible. All films have low ticket prices, nearby screening locations, and considerate showtimes. Great pains have been taken to make this event open to the full Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh community. I commend all the students and faculty behind the scenes who made this film festival happen, as well as all the organizations that provided their funding and support. 
The following quote summarizes my thoughts on this event quite well: “We must confront vague ideas with clear images.”** In my time as an undergraduate, I feel as though I am constantly confronting vague ideas, be they about self, community, or my field of study. I am grateful to the Carnegie Mellon IFF for confronting the vagueness of our world with clear images. For anyone feeling lost, isolated, or confused in this time of great upheaval, I encourage you to find solace in the dark comforts of the movie theater.

On a summer night, deep in the heart of 2020, I put my email into a half-baked website that might as well have spam bombed me. This is the beginning of August, to be exact. The U.S. had just passed 170,000 deaths from COVID, Kamala Harris had just been announced as Biden’s running mate, protests continued, and cable news saw explosive growth. Still, Apple’s streaming service, Apple TV+ (a horrifically confusing name), was still in its infancy and about to release one of its early central draws, an A24 documentary called "Boys State." While I could have just waited to see it easily and for free on Apple TV+ (which I think everyone is still somehow getting at no cost), I signed up on a shady website for a virtual early release screening of the movie. The movie was watermarked so that I couldn’t leak it, but behind that transparent text, I became transfixed by the extremely heightened, meaningless, and startling drama that was captured years ago at a convention for teenage boys in Austin, Texas. 
So yes, in case you’re as unaware as I was in 2020, Boys State is a political conference for high school boys, put on by the American Legion yearly in each state. During the week of the event, the boys have the opportunity to nominate themselves for positions in two mock political parties, the Federalists and Nationalists, then run and compete for a top position as Governor of a fake state organized and populated by 1,000 Texan boys who desperately need to get laid. This one week, and four of the most promising attendees, are documented exquisitely by Jesse Moss and Amanda McBaine. 
In what I will formally declare as one of the highest stakes documenting processes ever, our directors must pray that they manage to follow and shoot every consequential moment from the expansive conference. They have one attempt, a metric-ton of cameras and money, and 1,000 boys hungry to let out their opinions with the like-minded few, and gain, for one inconsequential week, the ability to rule ... a democracy. In this quest they succeed in strides, capturing everything from the major speeches laced with hypocritical statements, to the small dialogues where dominance and ego consistently clash, and even the "doomer" memes that are seen on the Instagrams of the attendees. Everything is captured in brilliant detail, with cinematography that beautifully flows from shallow to deep focus with ease. Everything is edited incredibly well too, and a great story is crafted from the mountains of footage they must have had to dig through.
After an opening credit montage that catches us up on some Boys State history and alumni (Bill Clinton, Dick Cheney, and Rush Limbaugh standing out), we meet two of the boys who it appears McBaine and Moss tracked down before the conference: Ben and Steven. Ben is a bilateral amputee who adores Ronald Reagan. He calls himself a “politics junkie.” In one of the strangest and brilliant documentary introductions I’ve seen, we watch him rehearse an introductory speech in his kitchen for his mom and dad, where he explains his reasoning and justification of his conservative ideology. He doesn’t connect with the fiercely masculine energy of his opponents (did I mention there is an athletic element to the conference?) and has to rely on other methods of garnering support for his run. 
Now you might be beginning to imagine why our filmmakers chose to study the Texas iteration of this event, and, well, there are certainly many reasons why Texan boys are ideal for studying masculinity and partisan politics. The plethora of bitingly conservative statements managed to be worded as vaguely moderate and "fair to both sides" might be our largest nauseating reason (these boys do so much devil's advocating that it feels like they’re at a parliament meeting in Hell). It's the many strangely controversial yet empty statements that we hear coming from the attendees that begin to remind us that these boys are not only running an imitation of our Government, but also the politicians that make up that “special democracy” that they cherish.
Voiceover of our second protagonist, Steven, tells us he is a “progressive person in a room full of mostly conservative people.” He’s a real Bernie bro who avidly takes part in local governance and door-to-door campaigns. He, along with boy 3, René Otero, make up the progressive half of the boys we see in depth (both of whom shield themselves by toning down their views and aligning themselves with "bipartisanship"). Boy 4, Robert MacDougall, is an extremely charismatic moderate who is brilliantly and horrifyingly shown hiding many of his personal beliefs to run a conservative campaign. This pattern is one of the most startling themes of this movie: At what point do you sacrifice your own beliefs to satisfy what you think everyone around you wants? Why do you even do this? 
When I first saw the movie in 2020, I found such a deep comfort in the openness of it all. It scratched a dark recess of my head that had been wound up from a time where politics was the only thing you could find online, while the real world hid the talk of politics because it might be abrasive. This movie shows a rather extreme crossover of the two. The reality of the digital political age with Texan teenage boys. It can be quite maddening at times, if not horrifying. How can people choose to make politics their personality when this is the end result? These questions barely scratch the surface of what is brought to light in this movie. I don't know if you will leave this thinking it was horrific or hopeful, I don’t even know if you should watch it now or wait for a rainy day when you’re about to jump through a window because of our brilliant elected officials (…maybe that is now). Either way, I hope this movie brings you something to articulate your frustrations and engage your fascinations.

Owen Bonk is my friend who is unfortunately in the famous country of Germany, allegedly “studying abroad,” but currently locked in his Wohnheim with COVID-19. However, no coronavirus can stop the power of Charli XCX, whose fifth studio album "Crash" was released this past Friday. In this symposium, Owen and I analyze the sounds, themes and context of Charli’s newest album in the context of her wider work. 
PRIA: So, can you tell our readers why do we have international Charli XCX expert, international pop culture expert, and public intellectual Owen on the phone with me?
OWEN: Well, something really important happened about two days ago. And that was the release of Charli XCX’s fifth studio album, "Crash."
PRIA: Do you want to give us a little bit of background on Charli XCX as an artist, a musician and a phenomenon?
OWEN: Sure. She rose to international prominence with the song that she wrote and featured on called “I Love It” — that was her first major hit, with Icona Pop. Then, she released a gothic, 80s-inspired album called “True Romance” and that was her debut — but she didn’t really achieve mainstream success until “Sucker” which is when she had her big singles, “Boom Clap” and “Break the Rules,” and then she sort of took a left turn into the world of art-pop and electro-pop. She’s commonly referred to as the progenitor of the hyperpop genre that we are seeing grow more common through the 2020s.
PRIA: The predecessor to this album was "How I’m Feeling Now," which was... 2019?
OWEN: 2020. 
PRIA: Yes, 2020 — but that one — is she even an album?
OWEN: I don’t know how I feel about it.
PRIA: I don’t know how I feel about it. I don’t know how I’m feeling now about "How I’m Feeling Now." 
OWEN: Well, what’s funny about it is that it’s actually longer than the current album that she just released, and yet it feels like much less of an album because it’s so DIY.
PRIA: “How I’m Feeling Now” was this very DIY, quarantine, garageband, getting-all-my-girls-together-on-Zoom sort of vibe, while on the other hand when I listened to “Crash” I was like — you know when you watch a movie normal style and then you watch it on Blu-ray? I was like, this is the Blu-ray of music.
OWEN: It feels like it’s in HD, for sure. The thing about it that stuck out most to me on first listen was the vocals, because they’re so pushed to the forefront of each track. On “How I’m Feeling Now” she was kind of hidden behind this cloak of autotune, and now she’s like…  a vocal diva.
PRIA: Vocal diva, yeah. I think the big thing for all of Charli’s fans, what we’ve been wondering, is “What is the era that she’s in?”
OWEN: I think some might argue that it’s a bit incoherent, but some might argue that there’s a plan behind it - personally I think everything she’s doing is deliberate, even cussing out her fans on twitter.
PRIA: Did you see the tweet that was the photo of her wearing the shirt that says “They don’t build statues of critics” and then the politics reviewer for the LA Review of Books responded with “this is a photo of a statue of a famous literary critic”? I feel like that epitomizes the cross-section of high culture and pop culture that Charli exists within. Would you say “Crash” is even pop-ier than her early work? Is it a different kind of pop?
OWEN: I think that what she did was that she lassoed all the people who like hyperpop and then with this album she tried to convert them to normal pop.
PRIA: Wow. So in a lot of ways Charli XCX is performing conversion therapy on her fanbase.
OWEN: Yes. You heard it here first folks. But I don’t think “Crash” can exist just as a bid for mainstream success — I don’t think that that’s what she’s doing, and I don’t think that that’s what she’s really interested in. She’s talked a lot about how she feels that when she did achieve mainstream success with “Boom Clap” she felt really lost in it, and she didn’t know what to do with it, so I think that it’s not her ambition — I actually think that “Crash” is more of a homage to underground pop from the 2010s.
PRIA: That’s interesting. I almost feel like, since she’s doing the Janet Jackson thing, she’s doing the 80s thing, she’s doing the 90s thing, I almost feel like because she’s drawing on so many references at once, and then being so over-the-top about them, and pushing the vocals to the forefront - it’s subversive. I don’t know how. Despite being so much more slickly produced and the vocals being so much more conventional than anything she was doing before, it still feels subversive - almost because everything she’s doing has a wink and a nod? She’s trying to push all these tropes she’s embodying to the furthest extreme that she can, to like, become both a pop diva and continue to be this notably avant-garde pop cultural phenomenon.
OWEN: Yeah. I totally agree. I’m thinking particularly about the song “Twice”, which is the last song on the album, it has a lot of elements of very easy listening, chart-toppers - it’s a song for people who love chill music or love chilling out to music. That’s not usually Charli’s niche — she’s more of an “engaging with the listener” type of girl. What’s interesting about this song is that the “wink” here is that she’s talking about mortality. It's a really dark subject matter for a song. When she’s saying “don’t think twice about it” what she’s saying is “don’t think twice about life or you’ll go down the rabbit hole and you’ll just start having all these morbid and terrible thoughts.”
There’s this other thing that I saw on the Pitchfork of this album, which is that “Yuck” sounds like “Kiss Me More” but dark — and I thought that was so true. It’s really latching onto that groovy sound that Doja has really pioneered.
PRIA: We’ve talked a lot about how this album relates sonically to her prior album, but I’m also interested in how this album relates thematically to her prior albums, cause I definitely think that by using the tropes that we’ve come to love and rely on — this very soft, groovy style of pop music — but then making it dark, twisting it, pushing it too far, she’s both a pop artist and a pop musician and an incessant commentary on what it means to be a pop musician. No matter how earnestly she pushes herself or no matter how much she tries to quote-unquote “sell out” she’s always gonna be doing commentary.
OWEN: That’s why she is the total apex of the “Craftsman” archetype rather than being solely an artist — she always has an industry angle on things. I think she said, actually, in interviews that this album contains a lot of themes about how women are treated in the music industry and the ruthlessness of it. I think that’s really funny cause she’s like, making music about how music gets made, it all seems so self-referential.
One thing about Charli that people need to put into context is that she’s always been really good at distilling things. She’s not Taylor Swift for a reason. Taylor is verbose, and stretches things out, but Charli likes to pack them into little metal boxes.
PRIA: What do we think is next for Charli, after this album? What’s next for us is we obviously have to go see her live in every single country and cry our eyes out, but what do you think Miss Girl is going to do next? 
OWEN: I think that she has reached the zenith of this pop era. I think she’s gonna go back to experimental stuff next. But maybe it won’t be hyperpop, necessarily… but it will definitely be some sort of pop.
PRIA: Maybe she’ll learn Mongolian throat singing.
OWEN: Yeah. I mean. Honestly what I love about her is that you never know what to expect exactly, and she keeps talking about how boring it would be if she leaned into the hyperpop shtick, which I agree with. I think if she had made another album of “Beep Boop” we would all be like. Oh god.

Dear movie critics, 
Why? Why are so many of you the way you are? 
It is ironic that I am saying this considering that I have written so many reviews for The Tartan. Growing up, I also loved reading reviews from critics like Roger Ebert. Even if I didn’t agree with everything he said (and he had some baffling takes), he genuinely loved movies and the magic they brought. He would lovingly describe the aspects of movies he appreciated and his own language would bring the movies to life. He would articulate the aspects I like better than I could, and that inspired me to get more into movies and start taking a closer look at them. Eventually, I tried my hand at being a movie critic. 
Unfortunately, in doing so, I discovered that being a critic is the worst thing ever. I have now written so many reviews of movies in this newspaper, and I don’t like three-fourths of them. I tried figuring out why being a critic is bad or why those reviews are bad, and after a lot of thinking, this is the long explanation I have come up with. 
We have the following four groups of people that need to be considered: artists, critics, financiers, and audience. The first three groups are fairly obvious, but it’s the word “audience” that is extremely broad. Audience always needs to be considered by artists, critics, and financiers within the context they are in. Unfortunately for us all, none of those three groups are aligned in how they choose to handle the audience. 
The split between artists and financiers in terms of how they view the audience is obvious, but it’s not as far apart as people think it would be. Artists do have to find ways to properly market themselves and their art so people will want to engage with it. Financiers need to make sure they make money so the studio can stay afloat. The goal is the same for both, but since financiers are so much more concerned with running a business in a cut-throat industry than making good art that they often suffocate the artist in the process. The resulting art that comes out ends up not being well received by the audience in many of those cases anyway, or it’s not promoted properly and immediately forgotten. The opposite direction can be true where the studio is trying to do their best to give the artists all the resources they need and the artists still mess up, such as the showrunners of Game of Thrones. But more often than not, it is the financiers causing these kinds of issues. This has especially gotten worse with the monopolization of intellectual property by corporations like Disney and AT&T. 
But the split between the artist and the critic is not as obvious. Artists and critics may both share the goal of wanting something good that they’re happy with, but they have separate roles. If pop culture could be defined as a melting pot, the artists are the ones tossing everything in the pot while the critics are the people who just kind of happen to be in the kitchen and want to be part of the fun without actually putting ingredients in the pot. The artists need to keep adding to the pot trying to guess what on earth both the audience and critics will like, while critics are trying to critically analyze the pot while attempting to capture an audience who will actually bother to read what they have to say. The natural problem with this is that everyone’s definition of fun is different, and monetization and commodification of art favors certain kinds of fun over others. 
This leads us to the link between critics and financiers. Prior to social media and the Internet, the word of critics in newspapers and other print media publications was effective at generating good buzz for movies. Conversely, bad press would kill audience interest. Press screenings were and still are important, and readers would stick with reviewers they found reliable, but once social media and the internet took off, the critics were no longer the primary method of generating buzz. You don't need to be in film journalism anymore to have a relevant movie opinion. Now anyone with a blog or a YouTube account can make reviews. The definition of critic expanded because the line between audience and critic blurred. 
Ultimately, critics also need to make money, and in the age of the Internet, journalism is not making as much money as it once did since online advertising doesn’t pay as much as print advertising. On top of that, press screenings are much more limited now that so many more critics are around who can get access to these screenings. Now I’m not claiming that these reviewers are being paid off nowadays, but it is revealing that the reactions at every press screening for every studio release is the same, vague set of phrases and sentences each time, such as, “WOW! Some people will love it, and some people will hate it!”
The result is that many reviews are generic now. It’s like critics have a list of boxes they need to check for a review to maximize readership rather than give their actual thoughts on a movie. Review aggregate sites like Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic exacerbate this, and they’re a major reason for the decline in critics’ credibility. The YouTube film sphere (which I’ll get to later) likes to make a lot of fun of film journalism now, and they’re absolutely right to do so. At least 60% of the Marvel movies are not good yet they have overwhelmingly positive critical consensus, even if many of the “positive” reviews weren’t all that positive. If I have to read the line “there’s something for everyone” or “this will please die-hard Marvel fans” one more time, I will personally DM Anonymous on Twitter to get Rotten Tomatoes taken down permanently. 
Additionally, cultural analysis ends up pandering to audiences in eerily similar ways film financiers pander to audiences. I remember reading reviews for “Crazy Rich Asians” and practically every review spent half the time talking about the diverse cast rather than the movie. In fact, any movie with diverse casting is always the biggest deal ever for critics, but in the process they’ll cheapen the importance of diversity by espousing generalized rhetoric focusing on its importance and not about how it fits the story. Opinions are also sensationalized and exaggerated for clicks and views, which is incredibly frustrating because then the article itself will be a worthless addition to the overall discourse for a movie. Everyone lost their mind over “Joker” over its violence and the decision to portray a mentally unstable, white mass murderer, even though that movie had no bite and barely barked. 
But the biggest problem of being a critic is that, fundamentally, none of our opinions matter. This is a hard pill to swallow, but I think all 7.8 billion people on this planet need to do it. Your opinion isn’t gospel, and your film taste isn’t "good." You just like what you like and if others happen to like it, that’s great. If others hate it, that’s also great. That’s part of the fun. The best film criticism is now in the form of video essays on YouTube, mainly the ones that focus a lot on breaking down the filmmaking craft and artistry. But those who function more as standard reviewers are still mostly insufferable, and it’s because many of those reviewers try so hard to distinguish between a “good” movie and a “bad” movie like there are objective ways to do that consistently. 
The cynicism in the film community is getting worse, and the cynicism is translating into reviews that don’t feel like they talk about movies lovingly anymore. Instead, cynicism is part of the review’s brand, with critics trying to really prove that they’re not like the other critics who just blindly give bland studio releases good reviews. I was in this phase for a while, and unfortunately there are many of my movie reviews that do this and I simply don’t like them anymore. One of my favorite reviewers on YouTube is Chris Stuckmann, and he got so tired of getting angry and cynical about movies that he now only reviews movies on his channel that he likes. He also doesn’t assign grades or ratings to anything anymore. He’s right though. Why bother trying to do that? It’s exhausting. Just enjoy what you want, and at the same time, be wary of the commodification and monetization angles that insidiously permeate the industry like they always have. 
Ultimately, that doesn’t mean critics are useless. Analyzing media is always going to be relevant, and it’s good to have people talk about what elements of a movie resonated and what elements didn’t. Those healthy discussions should be encouraged. But, as Anton Ego said at the end of “Ratatouille,” bad art will always be more meaningful than good criticism. Critics just need to always keep that in their head as they write. I certainly will be, and I hope other critics try their best to do that too. 
That’s the end of my rant, critics. You can go back to being sad about the infantilization of the movie audience (which will be an article for another day). 
Lowest regards,
Sujay

Fingernails the world over were chewed off and spat at any screen with Vladimir Putin on it following the invasion of Ukraine. Rivers of anxiety cross streams of tears as the world reels in horror. But what follows horror? Fear. And what follows fear? Another synonym. And after that? Confusion. Western Europeans, Eastern Europeans, Ukrainians, and most importantly, Americans, are struggling to make sense of what has rapidly turned into a social media swirly in the middle school bathroom of geopolitics. Who should we turn to? Who should we listen to? Who should we ask about Ukraine?
Below is a list of trusted sources of information, interpretation, and consolation:
And finally, yourself. Ask yourself what to think, and maybe ask why you’re so willing to accept that anybody anywhere knows what the hell they’re talking about.

Divest CMU, a student-led environmental group, wants the university to cut ties with the fossil fuel industry. In its petition statement, the group wrote: “From 2011 to 2019, the percentage of the endowment invested sustainably declined from 3.6% to 1.9%, despite the endowment doubling in size.”
Between 2020 and 2021, the endowment grew by more than one billion dollars, a 43 percent return rate. Of the university’s $3.1 billion endowment, only 1.9 percent is invested in “sustainable industries," according to university data self-reported to the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE). Carnegie Mellon’s annual report does not disclose the amount it invests in the fossil fuel industry. 
“The university does not have a blanket fossil fuels divestment policy, nor does it have plans to pursue one,” Chief Investment Officer Charles Kennedy wrote in a statement to The Tartan. Instead, he said, the university invests in “managers that are addressing issues such as sustainability and energy transition to persistently create value in their companies.” Carnegie Mellon does not have a sustainable investment policy. 
Since its launch on March 1, the Divest CMU petition has received 115 signatures; approximately 50 percent are Carnegie Mellon students, 25 percent are alumni, and five percent are faculty, according sophomore Charlotte Ng, who is leading the movement. “To us,” she said in an interview with The Tartan, “it seems hypocritical to invest in fossil fuels when CMU likes to boast about its commitment to the environment.” 
When asked if Carnegie Mellon employs a written standard of ethics when making investment decisions, Kennedy referred to the university’s Code of Business Ethics and Conduct. The Code’s section on financial assets does not discuss ethics. Aside from emphasizing “the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct” and that business be conducted “in good faith and with fairness, accuracy, integrity and respect for others,” the only other relevant Code section addresses conflicts of interest of investment advisors. 
“CMU considers environmental, social, and governance [ESG] issues both because it impacts performance, but also because it encourages accountability and transparency,” Kennedy explained to The Tartan, “which may lead to reduced exposure to various risks and improved long-term value creation.”
Kennedy views revenue generation as a mechanism for sustainable decisions, both ethically and financially. “By following strong ethical business practices, [Carnegie Mellon’s] investment managers can demand higher market valuations for their companies because of their standing as reputable leaders.”
Sustainable Earth co-presidents Eden Harel and Jenna Stanislaw told The Tartan that the university is responsible for its environmental impact on the local community. Harel, a graduate student studying civil engineering, referenced the influence of “Andrew Carnegie, the steel industry, and the gentrification that CMU has contributed to.”
Carnegie made his fortune from industrialization. By the time he was 30, the Carnegie Steel Corporation was underway, which would become “the largest steel manufacturing company in the world,” according to The Carnegie Corporation of New York. Pittsburgh was the global capital of steel production in the 20th century. The environmental repercussions of this legacy continue today; of U.S. cities, Pittsburgh has the fourth highest pollution-related mortality rate. 
Harel and Stanislaw led Sustainable Earth’s advocacy for an Office of Sustainability. “Lots of students have ideas about how to promote sustainability on campus,” Sanislaw explained, but the “distinct lack of centralized authority makes it challenging for students to share them.” After proposing an Office of Sustainability to the university, Stanislaw “felt like they were meeting with us to check the box to say they were receiving student input rather than actually listening to us.”  
Numerous peer institutions have an Office of Sustainability. Yet Carnegie Mellon administration, according to Stanislaw, continuously told her “research needs to be done.” That line of reasoning fell short for Stanislaw: “We’ve done the research.” 
Carnegie Mellon’s Sustainability Initiative outlines education, research, and practice goals for the university and began publishing annual reports in 2020. The document identifies ways that Carnegie Mellon is promoting environmentally-conscious programs and gaps it needs to fill.
After circular conversations with administration, Sustainable Earth doubts Carnegie Mellon will pool the resources for an Office of Sustainability. “Pushing for an Office of Sustainability took up a lot of our combined efforts and that was met with a lot of force back from the college,” said Harel.
Stanislaw, a senior in biological sciences, expressed frustration towards the exhaustive efforts it takes to get the university’s attention. She feels Carnegie Mellon should “take responsibility without students having to demand it. Instead, they are doing things in a very particular way to appease stakeholders.” Stanislaw wants to see the university “giving more power to students in a way that’s more than just performative.”
Around the world, 176 universities are divesting from the fossil fuel industry, according to the Global Divestment Commitments Database. In 2020, the University of California (UC) system severed financial ties with fossil fuels. The UC system maintains the 12th largest university endowment in the country, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Among the 13 universities that Carnegie Mellon self-describes as peer institutions, nine have no divestment plans. In 2020, Georgetown and Cornell promised to fully divest within the decade; Princeton and Stanford have committed to partial divestment. 
At the University of Pittsburgh, 91 percent of students who voted on a 2019 ballot initiative supported fossil fuel divestment. When the university announced plans to phase out fossil fuel investments by 2035, their Student Government Board (SGB) demanded greater urgency. However, the university made no changes to the 2021 plan for gradual divestment. At $5.7 billion, the University of Pittsburgh ranks 24th in U.S. education endowment size.
In June 2021, recent Carnegie Mellon alumni Sean Donnelly, Katie Hart, and Jacob Feldgoise completed a report they had worked on through Roosevelt at CMU, a student-led policy-based think tank. “We recommend that CMU’s Investment Office implement an empirical metric,” they wrote, to quantify the environmental impact of “each company and private equity fund that is currently held by the university.” This would create a comprehensive tracking system to hold Carnegie Mellon accountable to its valued ESG factors. The team advocated for the university to publish this information, in the spirit of sustainability leadership. 
Divest CMU has spoken with Director of Sustainability Alexandra Hinniker, Vice Provost for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Wanda Heading-Grant, and leaders at the Center for Shared Prosperity. The Center, which funds projects to promote equity in Pittsburgh, was introduced in April 2021. 
Ng was encouraged by the Center’s receptiveness and support of the divestment campaign. “Their mission really aligns with ours,” she explained, citing the Center’s “work with local organizations involved in environmental justice,” which grounds equity work in representative inclusion. 
The Center for Shared Prosperity could not immediately respond after a request for comment by The Tartan. 
Fossil fuel divestment campaigns first appeared on campus in 2014, and have since slipped in and out of action. Newer initiatives include the Environmental Justice Speaker Series, which Sustainable Earth hosted last year, and Chartwells’ recommitment to composting. 
In November, Students from Carnegie Mellon, Chatham, and Pitt rallied together during a climate march. They called for university fossil fuel divestment, carrying signs that read “People over profit,” “Pitt invests in the end of the world,” and “Why invest in education if we have no future.”
Divest CMU is planning a rally for Saturday, April 9, at 1:30 p.m. Ng sees Carnival weekend as an opportune time to raise awareness about the urgency for divestment.
“CMU as an institution is dedicated to fighting climate change and creating a more sustainable world,” the authors of the 2021 Roosevelt at CMU report emphasized. “However, the university’s financial investments do not currently reflect this commitment.”

On Thursday, the Senate confirmation hearings for Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Supreme Court nomination ended. For this confirmation vote, the Senate is split 50-50 along party lines. Democrats expect to have all 50 of their caucus members vote to confirm. With the Vice President’s tiebreaker, that would be enough for Jackson to become the newest Supreme Court Justice and the first Black woman to serve as on the Court. 
According to Politico, Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin is hoping for a bipartisan vote, but most Republicans in the Senate will likely vote against Jackson’s appointment. 
The hearings started on March 21, with students from Louisiana’s Southern University Law Center flying in from Baton Rouge to support Jackson outside the Capitol. During her opening statement, Jackson thanked her family and mentors, including Justice Stephen Breyer, for whom she clerked and would be replacing. Referencing Breyer's opening statement when he was confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice, Brown addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee: “If I am confirmed, I commit to you that I will work productively to support and defend the Constitution and the grand experiment of American democracy that has endured over these past 246 years.”
For the next three days, Senate Republicans led tense questioning, including interrogations from South Carolina Senator Lindsay Graham, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, and Texas Senator Ted Cruz about Brown's sentencing of defendants in child pornography cases. Senator Cruz also questioned her about critical race theory (CRT). 
According to Cruz, the curriculum at Georgetown Day School, where Brown is a board member, is “filled and overflowing with critical race theory.” He asked her about her stance on teaching CRT in schools, bringing out a number of books as examples, including “How to Be Antiracist” by Ibram X. Kendi, and Kendi’s picture book “Antiracist Baby,” of which he presented enlarged pages. He also referenced “The End of Policing” by Alex S. Vitale, which received a rise in sales after Cruz held it up during the hearing.
In her answers, Jackson pointed out that CRT is an academic framework that does not affect her court decisions. “It doesn’t come up in my work as a judge,” she said. “It’s never something that I’ve studied or relied on, and it wouldn’t be something that I would rely on if I was on the Supreme Court.” She also clarified that Georgetown Day School is a private school, so the Court would have no jurisdiction over what is taught, and that as a board member, she does not have input about the materials used in the school. 
Jackson’s confirmation hearing has been a relatively smooth process compared to past Supreme Court Justice nominees. Senator Durbin announced that there will be an executive session for the committee on March 28, but the actual date of the vote can be pushed back to April 4.

The turn of the season has finally come, and with a Pittsburgh spring comes the Carnegie Mellon Student Government General Elections. The title “student government” is something of a misnomer because the student government doesn’t directly govern university affairs. Instead, student government largely serves in an advisory capacity to the actual governing body of Carnegie Mellon: its administration. So what exactly does your vote get you, if not decision making power in the university? Primarily, it gets you spokespeople whose function is to plead with the administration to incorporate student wants and needs into their decisions.
Advocacy is instrumental to any political system, but it is alone insufficient if we lack the bargaining power to enforce our demands and ensure the university upholds its promises. Unfortunately, student government is structured such that it lacks the leverage to function as anything beyond an advocacy body. Policy work in the Undergraduate Student Senate and Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) primarily consists of passing recommendations or, in dire times, strongly-worded letters in an attempt to persuade the university to adopt ideas students desire and benefit from. Likewise, the greatest merit of the Student Body President’s position, arguably the best claim for its existence, is that they have a more direct line to the Board of Trustees and the administration to advocate on behalf of students. Similarly, the university habitually espouses a commitment to student interests, demonstrated by granting limited representation and voting power on working groups and permanent committees. But, such gestures are rendered inconsequential when the ultimate decisions are settled by the senior staff and heads of the university, places where students have no voting power.
It should be emphasized that these problems are systemic and structural in nature and not a failure of those in student government. Many amazingly talented and dedicated people comprise student government and work tirelessly to make even the smallest improvements to the Carnegie Mellon experience. The Senate and GSA have also had incremental victories in student initiatives, such as leading the recent graduate stipend minimum and supporting the Trans, Intersex, and Nonbinary Alliances’s (TINA) push for increased gender inclusivity across university restrooms. But gradual policy success is not always enough; it is merely the only thing that the university lets us accomplish. 
Students have long been fighting for a university-wide $15 minimum wage; graduate students have been pushing even longer for better, more humane conditions and better, much deserved compensation. These and other such issues have been part of many election campaigns and the focus of various internal discussions over the years, with little else to show for it.
Whatever semblance of power we have extends only as far as the university leadership allows; ultimately, we remain beholden to their whims. Should the university resist, we have few means to counteract them saying no; should the student government push back or be more aggressive, the administration need only dangle the threat of burning the bridges so many have worked to build. The relationship between the university and the students is an overwhelmingly one-sided dynamic in which university leadership holds a significant advantage.
Student government exists in a dissatisfactory middle ground, trying to balance being an apparatus of the administration while also advocating for students, but continuously falls short of the latter. The university puts up far too much resistance to student demands, infantilizing us and telling us that our demands are “unrealistic.” Yet it simultaneously expects us to be functioning adults amidst our mental health crises, work overload, crushing tuition and housing prices, expensive services and amenities, awful wages for the majority of campus jobs, somehow even worse stipends for doctoral candidates, and mostly mediocre dining options that are managed by underpaid and exhausted service workers.
Ultimately, Carnegie Mellon is merely a microcosm of larger institutions perpetuating an illusion of democracy, which becomes the central problem with student government and its role in the university. When we examine the university’s power structure, we see that the students have little real power; instead, through bureaucratic procedures, ultimate and absolute decision making power is funneled into the hands of fewer and fewer people residing at the top of the university — the Board of Trustees, the Senior Administration, and the Deans. At the root of it, Carnegie Mellon is designed to be a fundamentally authoritarian institution.
Correcting this utter power imbalance and build a more democratic university requires leveling the playing field. Of course, these issues are much more complex than what this piece has the capacity to cover at once and the solutions likewise require nuance and complexity. GSA has found much greater success in effectively organizing the graduate student body, building strong administrative relationships, and leveraging their influence to apply pressure. The Undergraduate Student Senate has been less effective, partly a consequence of weaker institutional relationships and lower visibility on campus. To reach parity between graduates and undergraduates in this respect requires actionable steps to rectify these problems. One possible solution is for the Senate to take a page from the GSA and adopt a departmental representation model to ensure greater representation of all undergraduate student needs while improving its organizing capabilities. 
Similarly, the necessity of the Student Body President has been called into question for years, and as the role’s power has been diminished over subsequent reforms, it seems increasingly unnecessary. However, strengthening student government through reforms is only one step and should be coupled with building more bargaining power for the student body, particularly the undergraduate students. One of the most direct ways to politically organize students is to work towards a student union. This will not decrease the administration’s power, but rather will give students the ability to stand up for their own interests. Both Pittsburgh and the United States have a long history of labor, with students in particular leading organizing efforts as far back as World War I. If the university wants us to be adults, then they need to give us the ability to genuinely promote our interests and speak for ourselves. A union provides that, and the institutions Carnegie Mellon models itself after like UC Berkeley, MIT, Columbia, and Harvard all have student unions. Carnegie Mellon has the capacity to be an amazing place for its student body. If we want Carnegie Mellon to reach its potential, we must strive towards building a movement centered on a real democratic system, not just the veneer of one. 
Zeke Maroclo-Kemmerling was an Undergraduate Student Senator for the Mellon College of Science from 2019-2021, a 2020 Student Body Presidential Candidate, and served as Vice Chair of the Undergraduate Student Senate in the 2020 Term. Sujay Utkarsh is currently the Graduate Student Assembly representative for master’s students in the Institute for Politics and Strategy and the Master’s Student Advocate.

"Well... I've seen requests on Instagram from them. Um... other than that I don't know much." - Sophia, Class of 2025
"I actually ran for Student Body President last year and I'm not super involved with like the whole process this year, I decided to like take a break from it, and I would say I know who I'm going to vote for and I kind of know about the platforms. I didn't have time to watch the debates, but I kind of have knowledge about like the platforms, so I'd say I'm pretty sure about the elections, and I think I feel good about the people I'm gonna vote for. I think they're gonna do a good job." - Ari, Class of 2024
"I don't know much. I know people are running because like I see on like Instagram and stuff. I don't know, I haven't really like read up about it. I don't know if I'm going to vote 'cause I don't know who the candidates are." - Simran, Class of 2025
"First of all, I don't really know anything about it. I wish there was a little bit more information. I didn't see anything in my email. I usually keep a pretty good eye on that. Maybe if there was an email coming through that would be really helpful." - Camden, Class of 2025
"Uh ... the only thing I know is over social media. There's this account that followed me — 'salazarsong' — and another one for VPO that I forgot, but those are the only candidates I know." - Vivian, Class of 2025

Ahead of the Carnegie Mellon Student Government General Elections that will be open this week (make sure you vote!), candidates have been trying to communicate their platforms to their constituents, the student population of Carnegie Mellon. However, the path to becoming Student Body President/Vice President (SBP/SBVP) or Student Body Vice President of Organizations (SBVPO) is lined with (almost) empty promises and bordered by misinformation.
At both the SBP/SBVP and SBVPO debates, candidates frequently returned to Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS). One set of candidates at the SBP debate discussed CaPS not having the resources to accommodate all the students who need them while wanting to make students more aware of what CaPS offers. It sounds great in theory to promote CaPS to the student body, and yes, CaPS struggles to keep up with student demand. These statements are agreeable, but realistically, they function as buzzwords and nothing else with the act of promoting CaPS directly contributing to its backlog. 
During the SBVPO debate, candidates promoted moving CaPS into a separate location using their power as SBVPO. Firstly, that’s already happening as part of the construction of Highmark Center for Health, Wellness, and Athletics. Secondly, that’s completely out of the power of SBVPO. The SBVPO focuses on the recognition/re-recognition process for organizations and space allocations, not solving the mental health crisis at Carnegie Mellon.
This point highlights that some, if not all, candidates are out of touch with what the position they are running for actually entails. While these positions can act as advocates for the student body and organizations, in actuality, they don’t have much power to actually enact change. It may be nice for organizations to receive 150% more funding, but that’s not within the jurisdiction of the SBVPO. If voters are just taking statements like this at face value, yeah, sounds great! They got our vote! But unfortunately, due to the powers that candidates actually receive if elected, this is nothing but a pipe dream. 
Additionally, while it would be phenomenal to raise the minimum wage for student workers to $15 an hour, that also seems like nothing more than a pipe dream. Increasing wages was a main talking point of the current SBP campaign, and the previous SBP. The promises from past campaigns that have gone unfulfilled make it seem like we are destined to go another year at $8.25 an hour unless the Carnegie Mellon administration independently has a change of heart and decides to raise student minimum wage.
This also ignores that many of the candidates in the running for these positions have little experience student government. When asked at the SBVPO debate if the candidates had attended a Senate or Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) meeting, the short answer was a hesitant no. Though some had interactions with the Senate or GSA, it didn’t seem like they actually went to the meetings of the representatives of the Carnegie Mellon student body. Additionally, neither of the SBP/SBVP pairs made an effort to reach out to the Senate chair or GSA President to discuss their platforms. It would make sense if candidates reached out to representatives of the student body to get a formal sense of who their constituents are, right?
It’s disappointing that making empty promises is the status quo for those running for student body leadership positions. In an ideal world, leadership would accomplish all of the goals that we’ve been hearing about during this campaign season. However, it seems like it will be another year of students not knowing what the student government actually does and who they are until the next election season rolls around. 
In the end, no one really expects a perfect campaign from those running for student leadership. We’re all students with a large amount on our plates, and in a perfect world, the candidates would be able to deliver on all their promises. The sad reality is that we’re being delivered empty promises sprinkled with misinformation that will leave us unsatisfied. By next spring, the campus will be filled with the same question: “What does the student government actually do for students?”
