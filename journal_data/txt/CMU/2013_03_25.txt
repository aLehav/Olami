March Madness is the time of year when the sports world stops what it’s doing and focuses on college basketball for three weeks. Office pools for the NCAA tournament destroy productivity and more employees can be found in bars than in cubicles watching a plethora of games involving teams no one has heard of, but that everyone suddenly has opinions about. This is the time of year when Cinderella underdogs steal the heart of the nation, except for the people whose brackets are ruined by an improbable upset.
This year has been no different. With competition at the highest it’s been in years, no real powerhouse team has dominated opponents and small unknowns have beaten the longstanding powerhouses during the regular season. The level playing field has been apparent throughout the first two days of the tournament.
After an uneventful first round, the second round opened on Thursday, and the University of Pittsburgh Panthers were quickly sent home. Pitt, an 8 seed in the tournament, was dominated by Wichita State University, a 9 seed. The game was a slug fest with the two teams combining to shoot only 3–37 from three-point range and both teams averaging less that 40 percent from the field.
Both 14 seed Davidson College and 16 seed Southern University came within a few minutes of overthrowing 3 seed Marquette University and 1 seed Gonzaga University, respectively. Davidson led for most of the second half and had a chance to seal the deal with five seconds left, but threw an errant pass out of bounds, allowing Marquette to make a quick game winning layup. Southern University took a brief lead in the first half only to turn into a down by one situation after missing several shots in the last two minutes of the game.
The traditional 12–5 upsets continued with the University of Oregon beating Oklahoma State University and the University of California, Berkeley beating the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in a buzzer beater. Oregon exerted its dominance early, taking the lead for good half-way through the first half. The game was not even close in the second half, with the Oregon lead slipping into double digits. California kept the game closer, but never trailed in the second half as they cruised to victory.
The real upset of the night came in one of the late games, with Ivy League champion and 14 seed Harvard University defeating 3 seed University of New Mexico with relative ease. Harvard shot over 50 percent from the field and 44 percent from three-point range.
Friday had many more upsets with 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 seeds all losing to double-digit seeded opponents. Fifteen seed Florida Gulf Coast University knocked off the perennial basketball powerhouse Georgetown University in impressive fashion. This was only the seventh time since the tournament expanded to its current 64+ team format that so many upsets occurred; last year notable upsets included Lehigh University defeating Duke University, and Norfolk State University toppling the University of Missouri.
The 13 seed in the West Region, La Salle University, defeated the 4 seed Kansas State University, albeit in less convincing fashion than some of the other lower seeds. La Salle nearly choked, surrendering the lead late in the second half. They reclaimed the lead with 30 seconds to play and barely held on through a missed Kansas State jump shot that would have given them the lead with less than 10 seconds left.
Five seed University of Wisconsin-Madison fell to the University of Mississippi, winner of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) tournament. Mississippi is home to March Madness’s most animated player, Marshall Henderson. Henderson became known for his on-court antics after Ole Miss’ ran through the SEC tournament to earn their spot in the NCAA tournament. His most infamous move is the Florida gator chop sign, which he created after taking the lead against University of Florida in the SEC tournament finals.
Eleven seed University of Minnesota never trailed in their game against the historic basketball program of University of California, Los Angeles. They did it with lights-out shooting, making over 50 percent from the floor and over 56 percent from three-point range, ending the game with a 20-point margin of victory.
Iowa State University rounded out the double digit team success with its win over 7 seed University of Notre Dame. Iowa State scored early and quickly took control of the game, cruising to an 18-point victory.
As we go forward into the tournament, it appears that brackets will continue to get busted left and right. The upsets continued in the third round on Saturday, with first seed Gonzaga falling victim to Wichita State, and Oregon continuing to play bracket buster, this time defeating 4 seed St. Louis University.
This is the year of the unknown as parity reaches an all-time high in college basketball. While some of the traditional powers still remain (University of Louisville, University of Kansas, Indiana, Duke, Michigan State University), it seems just as likely that this year’s Final Four will likely consist of newcomers to elite college basketball.

Both the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track and field teams headed to Lexington, Va. this past week to compete in the Virginia Military Institute-Washington and Lee University Track and Field Carnival at Washington and Lee University.
The Tartans had three impressive finishes for the women in the 5,000-meter event. Senior Emily Wobb finished third with a 17:57.96 time, and sophomore Halley Bayer sprinted to finish with a time of 18:27.19, earning fourth place. Junior Elise Hall’s time of 18:44.09 gave the Tartans another top-10 finish in the race, as Hall earned eighth place.
Junior Jacqueline Guevel had two outstanding finishes, earning second place in both the 100-meter hurdles with a time of 15:10 and 400-meter hurdles with a time of 1:04.74.
Sophomore Erin Kiekhaefer also competed well in two events. In the 1500-meter race, she ran a 4:54.42 time and earned sixth place and earned another seventh place win in the 800-meter run with a 2:21.82 time.
Finally, sophomore Sasha Spalding ran successfully in the heptathlon, placing fifth with a total of 3,763 points.
Members of the team are positive about the results of the various events. “Overall as a team I believe we performed well,” Spalding said via email. “Even though the weather was not ideal everyone performed to the best of their abilities.”
On the men’s side, Thomas Vandenberg won the Tartans the only first-place victory of the event as he won the 800-meter race with an astonishing time of 1:53.31.
Senior Billy Littlefield crossed the finish line of the 10,000-meter run with a time of 32:38.20, earning third place.
Two Carnegie Mellon athletes placed in the hurdle events. Junior Mike Standish ran a 58.53 time in the 40-meter hurdles, and first-year Ben Neiman finished the 110-meter hurdles with a 16.21 time. Both athletes earned eighth place.
Junior Zachary Erra-Hernandez represented Carnegie Mellon well in the field events. 
In the hammer event, Erra-Hernandez was able to throw the hammer his career-best distance of 50.60 meters. He also was able to throw the shot put a distance of 15.08 meters, earning fourth place, and the discus 42.45 meters, earning eighth place.
Junior Nathan Cheek also competed in the shot put and hammer events. Cheek threw the shot put 13.97 meters, leading to a sixth-place finish. Cheek also placed seventh in the hammer event with a 46.46-meter throw.
Tartan sophomore Gino Pilato was the other Carnegie Mellon athlete to place in the discus event. Pilato placed seventh with a throw of 42.69 meters.
Finally, first-year Max Reinertsen jumped an amazing 12.81 meters in the triple jump to earn seventh in the event.
With a solid showing at Washington and Lee, the team is confident. “It’s still very early in the season,” Spalding said, “but I believe with good training, the men’s team should be able to win UAAs again, and hopefully the women’s team can finish in the top three.”
Both the men’s and women’s teams will next compete in the Carnegie Mellon Mini-Invite on Saturday.

The men’s tennis team captured a major win against the 24th-ranked University of Mary Washington, beating the Eagles 7–2 at the Lakevue Athletic Club and improving the Tartans’ record to 8–3.
Carnegie Mellon initially suffered losses in two of three doubles games, creating momentum for the Eagles, but the Tartans soon recovered with a sweep of the six singles games. 
No. 1-seeded player Christian Heaney-Secord credited 6-seed player Harsha Rao with carrying the team forward, praising him for “winning a tough match when the team needed it.” Heaney-Secord praised the team’s overall performance in crucial tiebreak points and attributed them to the strong singles play.
In addition to Heaney-Secord and Rao, first-years Abhishek Alla, Yuvraj Kumar, and Kosuke Hasegawa, and senior Duke Miller experienced crucial singles victories. The lone win from doubles play came from the team of Hasegawa and Kumar, demonstrating the importance of the young players to the men’s tennis team.
Individually, the matches were very close. “I may not have played the best, but I got the job done,” Alla said via email. “It was important [that I won] the third set.”
Alla praised the Eagles, saying “Mary Washington is a solid team. They have strong doubles pairs and solid singles. It was a good win for us.”
Kumar credited the strong singles performances, saying “The fact that there was a lot of energy and they wanted to come back after spring break was important”, adding “individually we did very well and … had a good comeback after spring break.”
He continued, “It’s really going to help us with our ranking, and the momentum will help especially when we’re playing Johns Hopkins University and Kenyon College, a No. 2-ranked team, in the next couple weeks.”
Moving forward, the team is facing two back-to-back games against Washington and Lee University and Johns Hopkins, ranked 23rd and eighth, respectively.
“We need to start off early and get the lead after doubles … and we have to figure out a way to use our deep team to win every single match against top teams such as Hopkins or Kenyon, who have strong singles lineups,” Alla said. The win against Mary Washington followed a streak of three painful losses, including an 8–1 shellacking by Trinity University.
The team has high hopes to finish off the season. Heaney-Secord said, “I want us to make the NCAA tournament, since last year we missed it and it was very tough for the team.”

HERB — the Home Exploring Robot Butler — can often be seen through the glass walls of the Personal Robotics Lab in Newell-Simon Hall picking up iced tea bottles or taking books off a bookshelf. Complete with fingernails and a British accent, HERB is the perfect caregiver: He can open doors, microwave meals, and even separate an Oreo cookie from its cream.
“The focus of the Personal Robotics Lab is physical interaction with the world — opening doors, picking up objects, cleaning,” said Siddhartha Srinivasa, director of the lab and associate professor in the Robotics Institute. “The focus is on complicated manipulation tasks with a lot of uncertainty and a lot of clutter. If you look at a factory floor, robots can do magical things. But if you look at a home — at least my home — it looks nothing like a factory floor. So we’re trying to get robots like HERB to move from the factory floor to homes so they can perform useful tasks that a caregiver would perform.”
When Nabisco first approached Carnegie Mellon and requested an Oreo-separating robot for its “Cookie vs. Creme” campaign, Robotics Institute project scientist Prasanna Velagapudi’s initial reaction was, “If there was going to be a robot that could do this, it would have to be the Home Exploring Robot Butler. I mean, that’s exactly what you’d want a butler for, right?”
Srinivasa was enthusiastic about the challenge’s potential for public outreach. “We’ve always struggled to get technology and robots to be appreciated and understood by people other than scientists,” Srinivasa said. “It’s a cool robot and we want everyone to know how cool it is.”
However, he admitted that in the beginning they did not know if HERB had the precision and dexterity to actually separate an Oreo cookie. “It would be like having a giant football player wearing winter gloves trying to manipulate a tiny Oreo,” he said. “It was by far the most fragile, delicate, small, sensitive object we have ever manipulated.”
Nevertheless, HERB rose to the challenge and starred in what is now a widely circulated YouTube video documenting the robot’s success in separating an Oreo’s cookie from its cream. Not only is HERB the only research robot to have ever completed the task, but the process through which its algorithms were improved to separate an Oreo resulted in the creation of new tools that will be useful in completing other tasks in the future.
“The true color of a good algorithm,” explained Srinivasa, “is that it is very generalizable. HERB can get a meal out of the fridge, microwave food, clean up after a mess, and separate an Oreo. The underlying algorithms are the same across all these tasks and are even generalizable across robots.”
Velagapudi described the Personal Robotics Lab’s goal as building up libraries and algorithms that are not just specific to individual tasks, but can be applied to a broad range of activities. “We see each task not as something we have to design an algorithm specifically for, but more like points in the space of solutions that we should be able to cover,” he said.
Despite HERB’s technical capabilities, he still needs to work on his manners. “One of the things that we’ve noticed is that we spent five years on improving capability, but people are still hesitant to accept robots in their homes. It’s not just about capability — it’s about behavior, how situationally aware it is, and how sensitive it is to your own personal space,” Srinivasa said. 
The Robotics Institute works with the Human-Computer Interaction Institute to study what robot designs users find most acceptable. “The Oreo demo gave us an opportunity to play around a lot with HERB’s expressiveness,” Velagapudi said. Walking up and down the hallways of Newell-Simon Hall and putting his hand on Srinivasa’s shoulder at one point, HERB certainly seemed like a very friendly robot.
Srinivasa envisions a future where robots in the home will be more common. “The amount of technology we have now in our homes is more than what the biggest research labs had 25 years ago, so I think it’s inevitable that we’re going to have more and more automation,” he said. With HERB paving the way, personal robotic butlers are no longer a part of science fiction, but a reality that is currently being developed on Carnegie Mellon’s campus.

It’s easy to get the ball rolling for an online project, but managing them is a different story. Kurt Luther is out to make the managing aspects a whole lot easier. A postdoctoral fellow at Carnegie Mellon’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Luther is the creator of Pipeline, a tool that will help people collaborate on online projects. After researching the way online collaborations currently work, Luther identified some key problem areas.
“On one hand, the creator can just trust himself and everyone else in the project is not trusted. That ends up looking like a benevolent dictatorship and is sort of a top -down style of leadership…. On the other hand, the creator can trust almost everyone in the project, causing it to look like a wiki system where software doesn’t constrain what people are allowed to do,” Luther said. “Instead, [Pipeline] allows the people involved in a project to communicate with strangers who aren’t involved but have an interest.”
The idea for Pipeline originated while Luther was completing his dissertation as a Ph.D. student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He had just finished a degree in computer graphics and animation, but his adviser, Amy Bruckman, was interested in online communities. While looking for an issue that overlapped both of their interests, Luther discovered collaboration on creative projects online that have failed due to the leader being overwhelmed by a centralized management.
Luther then formulated studies to find issues that the creators faced, discovered different challenges in collaborative online projects, and thus found a way to manage them. It only seemed logical to develop a tool that improved success rates of online collaborative projects.
According to Luther, Pipeline is a web application that is a cross between a project management tool and a peer production platform. Not only does it have conventional project management capabilities, but it also allows others to easily search for projects in which they are interested by giving creators the option to make their works public. People interested in a project can ask to join the effort, stay in it for as long as they want, and leave when they feel they had done their part.
Compared to pre-existing project management tools, which only allow a small group of closely knit people to work on private projects, Pipeline distributes leadership by allowing the project creator to trust as many or as few people as he wants. 
Therefore, leadership is decentralized: The creator can assign tasks of varying importance to others, making them subleaders, or give project participants equally weighted responsibilities. In addition, Pipeline automatically updates changes made to the project.
All of these qualities facilitate completion of complex online creative efforts, much like the one that he featured in his Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW) lecture in San Antonio, Texas. He discussed developing Pipeline for Newgrounds, a website that allows people to create and distribute creative virtual projects such as short films, games, and artwork. According to Luther, less than 20 percent of the projects started on Newgrounds come to completion.
Luther decided to apply Pipeline to one such project, called “Holiday Flood.” Holiday Flood was organized during November and December 2011 and featured 30 artists from more than 12 different countries across five different continents that gathered to develop a digital calendar. Two pieces of artwork were submitted for each of the 12 days of Christmas to the Newgrounds site, and their thumbnails were lined up to give a preview of the actual calendar. Later, the interactive gallery was submitted, and site visitors were able to see all the artwork accompanied by a new rendition of “12 Days of Christmas” playing in the background.
In retrospect, Luther argued that Pipeline improved distribution of leadership for Holiday Flood and made it easier for people to know what others were working on. This way, the creator of a project no longer had the task of administering everyone’s duties — anyone can contribute ideas to improve the quality and success rate of an online artistic enterprise.

The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA)’s robotics challenge has been pushing scientists to create robots that surpass any they have developed thus far. Tartan Rescue Team, a team from Carnegie Mellon’s National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC), is developing the CMU Highly Intelligent Mobile Platform (CHIMP) robot to compete in the challenge.
DARPA created the robotics challenge in response to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear crisis, in which dangerous and health-threatening conditions prevented an effective human response. After the nuclear crisis, robots were not capable of properly dealing with the disaster. DARPA aims to promote the improvement of robotics technology to develop robots that can efficiently “work in dangerous, degraded, human-engineered environments,” according to the Tartan Rescue website.
Toward this end, the Tartan Rescue Team is engineering a class of robot that integrates robot autonomy with human control. This approach entails that a human controller would make high-level decisions for the robot, such as determining the path it takes, while the robot would have enough capability to avoid sudden collisions and maintain stability.
The team members include Siddharta Srinivasa, David Stager, Eric Meyhofer, Bryan Salesky, Alonzo Kelly, Maxim Likhachev, Clark Haynes, Herman Herman, and Drew Bagnell — all of whom are affiliated with  NREC or the Robotics Institute. The team’s sponsors include Kollmorgen, OshKosh, Pratt & Miller, and Honeywell, among others.
“The CHIMP robot has sensors, such as cameras and laser rangefinders, in its head and limbs to detect obstacles in the environment and to stop the robot before a collision occurs,” explained Tony Stentz, Tartan Rescue Team leader and NREC director. The robot is also intelligent enough to perform simple tasks, such as stepping onto rungs of ladders or turning steering wheels, without needing step-by-step control. The “supervised autonomy” method allows for a highly capable robot without the risk of technical difficulties and complications that could result from a fully autonomous robot.
“The primary advantage of supervised autonomy is that it is easier to achieve than full autonomy. Supervised autonomy provides a way for a remote human operator to control the robot via high-level commands and to help it get out of trouble,” Stentz said.
In addition to practical integration of autonomy and human control, CHIMP has a number of innovative physical features that would make it the ideal candidate to respond to disasters such as the Fukushima crisis. “The CHIMP robot includes a number of technical advances in mechanism design, robot motion planning, perception-enabled grasping, advanced mobility, and multilimb manipulation,” Stentz said.
One such advantage, namely its ability to switch between moving on rubberized tracks and on two limbs, provides tremendous advantages for physical stability as well as programming efficiency. When moving over rough grounds or debris, CHIMP maneuvers itself on rubberized tracks located on all four of its limbs. Moving with all four limbs on the ground prevents the robot from losing balance, even during a period of power failure or technical difficulty. It also avoids the complex programming required to coordinate a robot that only moves on two limbs. However, in the event that the robot needs to perform a task such as using tools or climbing ladders, it is able to switch to maneuvering on two limbs.
For robots geared toward responding to crises similar to the Fukushima nuclear crisis, Stentz believes it is imperative to make the robot as autonomous as possible. “For disaster-response scenarios, the communication link from the human operator to the robot may be unreliable; therefore, it is important for the robot to be as autonomous as possible. There are many hard technical problems, but I would say that the perception, grasping, and manipulation tasks are the most difficult to conquer to achieve greater autonomy,” he explained.
As detailed on Tartan Rescue Team’s website, robots will be judged on capabilities that include opening doors, climbing ladders and navigating walkways, and breaking through concrete panels using tools. The robots will also be assesed on more specific criteria, such as finding and closing valves near leaking pipes, and replacing components like cooling pumps.
According to Stentz, if the team were to win the robotics challenge, the ideas incorporated in CHIMP would be used in future robots.

While Pittsburgh weather might have you feeling otherwise, spring is officially upon us. And even though that currently means a high of 45˚F with flurries, soon the mercury will rise and the skies will clear. One necessary component of spring and summer will probably be sunglasses.
Besides being a fashion accessory, sunglasses provide necessary health benefits. Howstuffworks.com explains that a high-quality pair of sunglasses can provide protection from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays, protect your irises from overexposure to intense light and glare, and block out certain frequencies of light. And even though all sunglasses — whether they’re Ray-Bans or a $10 pair from Walmart — are made of some sort of tinted plastic or glass, you might be sacrificing some of the aforementioned benefits for price or style. But how do these accessories manage to protect your eyes from the sun?
First, some background on the phenomenon of light. The different colors of visible light — the ones we see in a rainbow — each have a unique wavelength and frequency. Light from the sun is white light, which is a combination of all colors. Other forms of light, such as UV radiation, have frequencies so high that our eyes cannot see them.
There are three different categories for the light we do see: direct, reflected, and ambient. As you might expect, direct light is light that comes directly from the source to your eyes. You would encounter direct light if you stared at the sun or a streetlight (not recommended). Reflected light, typically called glare, is light that has bounced off a reflective surface: Water, sand, and snow can form particularly harsh reflected light. Ambient light is light that has no clear source, an example of which is the glow that surrounds a city at night.
The ideal pair of sunglasses uses multiple technologies to shield against harmful light. The most familiar and obvious technology is the tint of the lens. Each tint — gray, green, yellow, brown, and even purple — has its own different function. While a gray tint is more all-purpose, yellow tinted glasses specifically filter out the blue wavelength to give its wearer a clearer, crisper image. The lenses become tinted by a process that includes smearing molecules that can absorb light wavelengths onto clear polycarbonate (plastic) lenses.
Another form of technology that sunglasses typically use is an ultraviolet coating. UV light is grouped into two categories based on its wavelength: UVA and UVB. Your cornea can typically absorb all of this light, but they can sometimes penetrate to the lens of your eye. This prolonged exposure can eventually form cataracts or even cause eye cancer. Sunglasses protect your eyes by absorbing the UV wavelengths, which is done by applying a UV coating to the lenses.
One last, popular piece of technology in sunglasses is the photochromic lens, which are able to change color when exposed to UV light. Many well-known sunglasses brands, like Transitions lenses, are made of plastic lenses that are coated in a film of organic molecules. According to The New York Times, these organic particles undergo a chemical reaction when they interact with UV rays and change shape so that the lens becomes tinted. Lenses that are made of glass typically have crystals that can also alter their orientation when exposed to UV light.
As you can see, a proper pair of sunglasses utilizes a lot of different technologies to protect your eyes. So the next time you’re shopping for a new pair of shades, look closely at the label to see what protection it offers. Now that you’re aware of the importance of eye protection, you have no excuse to forgo function for fashion.

New Discoveries show Lumpy Universe
A group of cosmologists controlling the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite recently completed a long-term study that created a heat map of the universe around 370,000 years after the Big Bang. 
This snapshot of the baby universe, taken using cosmic microwave analysis, largely reinforces the theory emerging over the past 20 years that the universe is expanding. This is mainly the theory of a universe dominated by the mysterious concepts of dark energy and dark matter (the map indicates the universe’s total mass make-up as 4.9 percent normal matter, 27 percent dark matter, and 68 percent dark energy).
However, like any major scientific discovery, the map also raised many questions. It seems that the universe is slightly lumpier than expected, with a large, anomalous cool spot toward the northern portion of our sky. Further, the map indicates the universe is actually 100 million years older than previously thought and that its rate of expansion is actually slower, coming in at 13.8 billion years and 67 kilometers per second per megaparsec (an astronomical unit).
The study, launched in 2009, is being well received by the cosmological community. Many cosmologists look to the discovery as a great tool for further reflection and analysis into the mysteries of the Big Bang and dark matter.

Computing takes a quantum leap in processiing speed
The major military contractor Lockheed Martin has announced that it plans to buy an early-developmental-stage quantum computer from the Canadian company D-Wave Systems. If D-Wave has created a successful quantum computer, this could have huge applications for the world of computing, especially in the hands of Lockheed Martin.
Quantum computers operate on the basis of quantum mechanics, which include some principles that are pretty strange and foreign to most people. In terms of computing this means that a bit (1s and 0s of computer code) can be interpreted as either a 1 or 0 or both, all at the same time. 
Scientists in this field have reformed the vocabulary here to refer to these new bits as Qubits (for quantum bits). This kind of computing can allow for computations up to a million times faster than the fastest computers today.
Many are skeptical about whether D-Wave has actually accomplished what they say they have, but if they have, the applications are endless. Lockheed Martin’s chief technical officer says they plan to test the technology’s applications in complex radar, space, and aircraft systems, but it will still be a while until quantum computing becomes commercially viable.

Greek organizations on campus came together last Saturday night to perform a series of 13-minute musical skits, both as a fundraiser for the Children’s Institute of Pittsburgh and as a celebration of their hard work this semester. The most successful acts took one of two approaches: Some fraternities and sororities poured their hearts and souls into putting on a crisp and professional performance, while others walked into Greek Sing knowing that they had a limited time span to put on something kitschy and funny.
The best example of the latter, more comedic approach, was Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s Law and Order: Special Victims Bluenit. This skit told the harrowing tale of Steve Burns, his dog Blue, and a crime-solving kindergartner named Trevor in their quest to find the dog Magenta. Through the discovery of three vital clues, the trio eventually discovers that Magenta was kidnapped by a bar of soap, because she was dirty and needed a bath. Highlights included a hard-bitten police chief and a parody of The Lion King’s “Can You Feel The Love Tonight,” entitled “Can You Feel the Suds Tonight.”
Clearly, the brothers of Sigma Alpha Epsilon had a great time putting this show together; the set consisted entirely of frat boys wearing cardboard cutouts of trees and boulders, rolling or crawling across the stage to show when Steve was moving. The kindergarten character who made potty-humor jokes, such as how he was still in need of diapers, was overdone, but Blue’s sarcastic cynicism was highly entertaining.
Special Victims Bluenit worked because it didn’t try to be something it wasn’t. The fraternity rolled with the slight slapdash feel of the performance and managed to create something really funny. Clearly, Sigma Alpha Epsilon was well prepared, but they emphasized the humor and playfulness that are such an integral part of Greek Sing.
On the other end of the spectrum, Delta Gamma and Pi Kappa Alpha’s rendition of Rock of Ages put on a near-professional show. The skit was an abridged version of the Broadway musical and told the tale of Sherrie, a young girl who wants to be a rock star in Los Angeles, and The Bourbon Room, a bar on the verge of being shut down. In an attempt to salvage his business, the bar’s owner hosts a concert for the famous Stacee Jaxx, but the rock star’s performance draws the ire of the mayor’s wife, Patricia Whitmore.
The sets were not overly complex, but the costumes were bright and eye catching. Members of both Delta Gamma and Pi Kappa Alpha threw themselves into their performance with an energy that lit up the room. Beyond even their clear passion, they performed with precision and care, resulting in a skit that was overall clean, crisp, and fantastic.
One show that walked the line between these two approaches was Alpha Phi and Alpha Epsilon Pi’s production of Rent. This skit was not merely an abridged version of the Broadway musical, but a parody of it, focusing on the struggles of Roger, Mark, and Mimi as they attempt to save Blockbuster from closing. Benny, the owner of Netflix and Mimi’s father, unfortunately thwarted that goal.
Alpha Phi and Alpha Epsilon Pi altered the lyrics of a classic musical just enough to be hilarious, without awkwardly clashing with the original songs. “Take Me or Leave Me” became a conflict between Benny, a proponent of Netflix, and Mimi, a lover of Blockbuster. “Goodbye Love” became a farewell to Blockbuster, while “Seasons of Love” was about the amount of time the characters had spent watching Blockbuster videos over the years. This skit effortlessly turned a deeply emotional musical into a funny, lighthearted sketch. This rendition of Rent was a high-quality skit, but it retained the air of ridiculousness and fun that characterizes Greek Sing.
However, Greek Sing is more than just a performance from fraternities and sororities; the event is the culmination of a huge effort to fundraise for the Children’s Institute of Pittsburgh. After the performances concluded, a representative of the Institute showed a brief video of a student, a young boy named Noah. The audience held a near-imperceptible air of impatience before the video began; the past two hours had been entertaining, but long, and everyone was hungry.
But the video was an important reminder of the importance of the efforts of the Greek organizations, and an example of the importance and impact of charity. The video let the audience see a particular person whose life was greatly improved by the efforts of the Children’s Institute. However, sophomore civil and environmental engineering major Michelle Cousté said, “I would have liked a more detailed look at all the different things [the Children’s Institute] does or even heard from the kids themselves more... Hearing from the mother that the school changed her kid’s life is encouraging, but hearing from the kid himself just warms your heart.”
Though everyone was enthusiastic during the performances and the Children’s Institute’s video, the most intense energy of the evening came during the awards ceremony. Most audience members who were not affiliated with a Greek organization sat in the upper balconies, while the fraternity and sorority members themselves filled the ground floor. This seating arrangement created an odd sensation in the upper levels of the audience; the relatively calm audience members looked down on the mass of Greek members as they howled with excitement and approval at the awards. Alpha Epsilon Phi and Pi Kappa Alpha split the Chairmen’s Choice Award, while Sigma Phi Epsilon won the Fraternity Philanthropy Award. Delta Gamma won the Sorority Philanthropy Award, after raising over $12,000. Delta Delta Delta came in second, raising over $10,000.
The initial goal of these fundraising efforts was $150,000 over the course of four years, all for the Children’s Institute. In the first year, Greek organizations raised $42,000, with $55,000 fundraised in the second. This year, their goal was $60,000. They actually raised $74,000, which put them at $171,000, well above their initial goal. Junior psychology major Caroline Flowers, the Greek Sing Overall Chair from Delta Delta Delta, said via email that Greek Sing’s support of the Children’s Institute will continue for the fourth and final year of their commitment. “Although we have already met our goal, we are thrilled to be able to support them for at least one more year,” Flowers said.
In terms of performance awards, the teams were divided into two categories. The singles division consisted of fraternities that had performed alone, and the doubles division consisted of paired fraternities and sororities. For singles, Sigma Alpha Epsilon (Special Victims Bluenit), came in first, with Phi Delta Theta in second and Delta Upsilon in third. In doubles, Delta Gamma and Pi Kappa Alpha (Rock of Ages) came in first, Kappa Alpha Theta and Delta Tau Delta came in second, and Delta Delta Delta and Kappa Sigma came in third. The competition was a close one, and Flowers said, “This year’s shows were some of the highest quality we’ve seen since I’ve been in school.... each show we saw this year was definitely successful.”
Though this show was open to the public, the main focus of the evening was the Greek community. Greek Sing celebrated the intense fundraising efforts of all of the Greek organizations on campus and the work put into producing the performance itself. Saturday’s show may have been the work of mere college students, but the members of the fraternities and sororities gave it their most creative and professional efforts.

The Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival opened last Thursday at the Melwood Screening Room. Walking into the Melwood Screening Room was like walking into a room filled with small treasures: You could feel the memories of old, obscure movies screened in the past. There was a small concession stand surrounded by classic Hitchcock posters that evoked an intimate surrounding and a love for cinema. It was the perfect venue for the festival.
This year’s theme is “Faces of Media,” a central part of our everyday culture. “Each year, we try to explore a different theme that is all around us, even though we may not always be fully aware of its critical importance….Media seemed like a great direction to go in this year, as smartphones and social media are greatly impacting local and global societies,” said senior history major and festival intern Sara Faradji.
On its opening night, the film festival kicked off with world-renowned filmmaker Michel Gondry’s The We and The I. Set in the present-day Bronx, the film centers on high school students on their last day of school. However, instead of focusing on their pre-summer festivities, the film takes place on a bus with all of the students eagerly on their way back to their homes. I was expecting it to be claustrophobic and constrained, but it was instead filled with spunk and endless energy.
The film left some with mixed impressions: Was it brilliant or was it too rushed? Regardless, viewers became hooked on the characters and their stories: When the bus finally reached its last stop, it’s safe to say that everyone in the screening room was sad to see the last of the teenage passengers depart from the bus. It was like a Bronx edition of The Magic School Bus — except with more heart and the feeling that you’re actually a quiet observer on the bus rather than an audience member. Viewers were able to relate to the ways in which these teenagers connected to each other, especially in today’s media-heavy world.
You couldn’t expect anything less from Gondry, whose filmography boasts such vivid works as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Be Kind Rewind. The film did not exaggerate the use of media; rather, it melded media into each of the students’ lives. As a result, we could truly identify with and feel the impacts of media and instant communication on a personal and grand scale. That feeling was quite powerful and heightened anticipation for the upcoming films in the festival and how these films will embrace the role of the media in our world today.
After the screening of the film, there were bounties of small French delicacies such as quiche and macaroons — carefully themed after Gondry’s French nationality. There were, of course, beverages, which made for an even more entertaining night. With stomachs filling with bread, cheese, and red wine, viewers were able to enjoy some great conversations about the film, which led to an atmosphere of genuine camaraderie.
The film festival also featured Paul Goodman’s Faces of Work as a tribute to the filmmaker, world-renowned psychologist, and Carnegie Mellon professor who passed away last year. Four of Goodman’s short films will accompany seven of this year’s films that connect to the theme of media and work. Goodman made films about how media have impacted people’s work around the world. His prolific filmography inspired the directors of the festival to feature his short films before the feature-length film of the night.
Another of Goodman’s contributions was his collaborative spirit, which had definitely made its mark on the festival. “One of Goodman’s passions was to engage all parts of Carnegie Mellon, and this year we really feel that this is true,” Faradji said. Professors from various departments at Carnegie Mellon are collaborating with some of the professional filmmakers to support this year’s festival, along with professors from the University of Pittsburgh, the Art Institute, Point Park University, and Robert Morris University.
With the incredible support and collaboration from such diverse sources, the film festival has been able to organize post-screening Q & A sessions, filmmaker workshops, and even lectures corresponding to certain courses at Carnegie Mellon. Scott Hamilton and Petr Lom are two of the featured filmmakers who will be offering such workshops to the community. Faradji added that “by working with professors, we hope that students from all different schools and departments will have the opportunity to see compelling international films and learn more about global cultures. It is as though the films serve as new and fascinating course texts.”
Looking ahead, another way that the film festival is engaging the community beyond Carnegie Mellon is its Student Short Film Competition, which will screen films by rising students from all universities. To connect with this year’s theme of media, competing students must address media and their global impact.
The Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival runs through April 13 and is a great chance for students to see what experiences film and media have to offer. You can’t say no to a compelling film — or to the complimentary food and wine.

One hundred venues, 2,200 performers, 20,000 attendees: The scope of South by Southwest (SXSW) is massive, drawing multitudes of hip twentysomething musicians, filmmakers, and partygoers to Austin, Texas every spring. Since its advent in 1987, it has continued to grow in size; music is typically one of the more popular aspects of the festival, with shows running concurrently for six of the 21 days of the festival.
Though the music portion spans a variety of genres, I was drawn primarily to the electronic showcases. The festival’s diversity makes it an excellent forum for discovering new artists. These were two of the most notable shows that I saw, and I will certainly keep track of these artists.
Andy Stott
Andy Stott has always been a stylistically agile artist. His performance at Resident Advisor’s official showcase on March 13 was a dark and dubby representation of his techno-inflected approach, displaying much of his more recent remixes and Luxury Problems releases. Lo-fi production and dirge-like rhythms chugged along somewhere in the 100 BPM region, incorporating odd elements of existential dread that recalled old Joy Division records.
For those unfamiliar with Stott’s work, it is haunting and atmospheric. His 2012 album Luxury Problems is laced with vocals from his old piano teacher, Alison Skidmore. In equal parts mournful and seductive — sometimes even operatic — she gives his music a sexy and haunting feel; her lyrics and Stott’s applications of reverb and delay made his performance particularly wistful. While his melodic layering and deep basslines may not suit everyone, those interested in techno (and experimental electronic music in particular) would be taken in by his live interpretations of his own work.
To fully appreciate Stott, it’s crucial to have subwoofers or a good pair of headphones cranked up to 11. The venue, Elysium, was perfectly suited to the artist’s visceral bass lines, and I was only able to gather a better understanding of his music by being immersed in that environment. That being said, regular listeners and newcomers to the experimental techno scene should still give him a shot.
Flying Lotus
Flanked by sheer monitors, the L.A.-based electronic artist Flying Lotus (also known as Stephen Ellison) made his presence just one part of the spectacle by projecting trippy images onto overlapping screens. The next 90 minutes were filled with transitions and layer blending that would enthrall any EDM fan, and most individuals in the audience will likely remember his selection of curative audio and choice samples (including Beastie Boys’ “Intergalactic” and his own “Astral Plane”).
The driving force of psychedelic emotion that Ellison evoked in his performance was largely due to his sample choice and manipulation. Like Amon Tobin, FlyLo — as his fans call him — is capable of recontextualizing samples in creative and distinctive ways, often producing entirely new instrumentals by rearranging existing musical parts. “All the Secrets” from Until the Quiet Comes, for example, does an excellent job of subtly altering piano melodies to bring about more dream-like, abstract themes. These themes are echoed in Thundercat’s vocals in “DMT Song” (with an obvious nod to the psychedelic drug of the same name). Though numerous overlapping patterns saturate his songs, he has a penchant for using a number of samples and vocals without cluttering his arrangements.
Graceful, humble, and enthused, FlyLo finished his set in a way that many did not expect: calmly. There was no final drop, no loud explosions of confetti or laser lights, and no gratuitous into-the-mic shouting matches. If anyone understands the flow and energy of a show, it is FlyLo: He knew that the audience had just danced itself into exhaustion for two hours. Lulling listeners back into a relaxed state (as he is known for with his Adult Swim-produced beats and bumps), Ellison left the stage to the chants of “One more song!” and faded into the background, letting the audience reflect back on what they had just experienced.
SXSW was both an opportunity to harvest a deeper understanding of familiar music and a unique chance to experience genres beyond one’s comfort zone. I recommend following SXSW blogs to discover more about the showcased musicians and attending the festival next year, if you’re able.

Combining the whimsy of Frances Hodgson Burnett’s The Secret Garden and the powerful punch of a colorful flower at the end of a dreary Pennsylvania winter, the Phipps Conservatory’s annual spring flower show once again exceeds expectations.
The show, named after the book upon which it is based, is arguably the most celebrated event the Conservatory puts on throughout the year, attracting more amateur photographers than the butterfly garden does caterpillars. From the moment visitors enter through the glass doors, nods to the classic story are sprinkled throughout the exhibit, which spans the entire premises.
The jewel-colored tulips and white-picket fences that first greet viewers set the tone for the exhibit: magical, old-fashioned, and sweet. In stark contrast to the dreary weather Pittsburgh seems to be cursed with, the show is a breath of fresh air. Filled with flowers of every imaginable color that were traditionally found in gardens of Victorian England, the garden beds also incorporate winding stone paths and charming statues.
Signs in each room explain the connections between the flora and the literature. Though the ties to the book could have been stronger and better explained, the effort is there, and Phipps never fails to wow visitors with the simple beauty and flawless execution of its exhibits.
The centerpiece of the exhibit is the Wild Garden portion of the Secret Garden. Ferns line the window boxes, tulips bloom cheerfully, lilac-colored blossoms whisper of a magical concept called spring, and rocks wind their way to a pond.
Though the Wild Garden’s layout was clearly intended to be the standout room in the exhibit, the Riotous Victorian Pattern Garden in the main alcove stole the show. The garden is fashioned in a bold pattern that includes bursts of orange, yellow, and red flowers, green foliage, and the stark white of pebble paths. At the center is a sophisticated fountain with a Romantic-revival statue. The stately palms guarding the corners of the brick walk only further the image of Victorian perfection. This room in particular is so stunning because of how well it goes with the architecture of the Conservatory. Somehow, the light streaming through the white glass panes and domed ceilings manage to complete the vision of travelling back in time.
The exhibit is fabulously colorful, exciting, and deliciously serene at the same time. The sign in the Wild Garden brags that “the mystery surrounding the garden was one of its greatest charms.”
The mystery of how Phipps manages to produce mind-blowing shows that enchant visitors of all ages is indeed one of its greatest charms. And thank Mother Nature for it, because after a seemingly endless winter, goodness knows that Pittsburgh could use a Secret Garden of its own.

As one would expect from the title, What We Collect: Recent Art Acquisitions 2007–2012 features artwork acquired by the Hunt Institute’s art department. The exhibit, which opened last Friday at the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation on the fifth floor of Hunt Library, is the accumulation of art dating back to the 1800s, making for a unique environment with a quaint feel. While some may ask, “Who would want to see pictures of plants?” the charm of the exhibit stems from the individual perspectives of the plants that each artist expresses.
Speaking of the artists, there are a plethora of them featured at the exhibit, making it enjoyable for a wider variety of people. Such artists include Pancrace Bessa, whose works were featured at the library four years ago in his own exhibit, called Pancrace Bessa and the Golden Age of French Botanical Illustration. Bessa was a French natural history artist whose botanical illustrations are characteristically detailed, probably a result of his years as a student of engraver Gerard van Spaendonck. His realistic illustrations of fruit and flowers transport the viewer to a garden or countryside abounding with beautiful flora.
Another 19th-century artist whose works are displayed at the exhibit is James Sowerby. An English naturalist and illustrator, Sowerby made illustrations that, upon first glance, look quite similar to those that Bessa produced. However, further examination shows that Sowerby’s style appears less realistic, though just as beautiful. While his older works were reminiscent of an old English countryside, his newer, more modern pieces of art have somewhat of a different feel.
One of the more contemporary artists whose work seems similar to those of Bessa and Sowerby is Beverly Duncan. Though her art also portrays a hint of the old-time feel that the other illustrations have, one views them differently knowing that they are newer. In fact, Duncan’s paintings reminds one of a kitchen, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Her paintings were mainly watercolor on vellum, an interesting combination that fit well into the theme of the variety of media.
The exhibit could be described as quaint, historical, and varied because it features so many different artistic methods. These ranged from watercolor on vellum, as in Duncan’s work, to charcoal drawing, even to wood engravings and copper etching. Not only were there detailed images of plants, such as those done by Bessa and Sowerby, but also seemingly accurate cross-sections of plants featured at the exhibit. The What We Collect exhibit is educational as well: One can learn how the history of people’s views of plants have changed and grown more intricate over time through the old and modern field guides and textbooks included in the exhibit.
This exhibit is open to the public and is free of charge. If you ever feel like taking a break from studying while at the library, or have an interest in artwork relating to nature, check out the exhibit for a truly unique experience.
What We Collect: Recent Art Acquisitions 2007-2012 runs through June 30. Exhibit hours are Monday through Friday 9 a.m. - noon and 1 p.m. - 5 p.m. and Sunday 1 p.m. - 4 p.m.

When we think of opera, we usually picture a large soprano in a Viking helmet belting a high, quavering note. It’s perhaps not the most flattering image, and, unfortunately, many people have negative associations with opera as a genre. But the School of Music’s performance of Lovers & Dreams: An Opera Scenes Showcase last Thursday and Friday showed that, far from being boring or inaccessible, opera can be wildly entertaining.
The showcase was held in the small Rauh Black Box Theatre in the Purnell Center for the Arts, making for a simple and intimate venue. Instead of a stage, the vocalists performed on black platforms that held very few props; only a desk, a stone bench, and a few potted flower plants lined the edges of the theater.
The brevity and variety of the performances kept the audience’s rapt attention throughout the program. Each five-minute piece was enough to show an impressive amount of talent — often exploring nearly every note of the vocalists’ range — but short enough to keep the program moving at an entertaining pace.
Interspersed between performances was playful commentary by many of the vocalists who performed. Though somewhat cutesy and clearly scripted, their remarks helped to give context to each of the pieces — something that School of Music shows oftentimes lack.
The showcase presented a unique challenge for the vocalists, performing in a genre that probes and tests the human voice, laying bare every strength and weakness a singer might have. In this case, the strengths were many and the weaknesses were few. Although all of the individual performances were impressive, some of the voices were perfectly suited to the pieces they performed. Though not quite as powerful as some of her peers, senior voice major Samantha Sugarman delivered a beautiful rendition of “Mir ist die Ehre widerfahren” from Richard Strauss’ Der Rosenkavalier with her sweet vibrato and impressively high range. At the end of the program, senior voice major Ashlinn Dowling gave a powerful performance as Butterfly in “Tutti i fior?” from Puccini’s Madama Butterfly, filling the entire theater with her strong, resonating voice.
Although the solo performances were all excellent showcases of individual talent, the group performances unquestionably stole the show. Perhaps the highlight of the entire eight-part program was “Nous avons en tête une affaire,” a boisterous scene from George Bizet’s Carmen featuring junior voice majors Mariko Reid, Chloe Holgate, Richard Wood, and Scott Cuva, and fifth-year senior English and voice double major Stephanie Johnson.
Although (understandably) breathless at times, each vocalist in this act delivered rapid, complex musical phrases in speedy succession — and in French, no less. In addition to impressive vocal talent, the performance was also exuberantly acted and elicited cries of laughter and shock as the characters began plunging knives into each other at the end of the piece.
From vibrant acting to jaw-dropping vocal talent, Lovers & Dreams: An Opera Scenes Showcase certainly had a lot to showcase. Not only were the performers’ talent and dedication apparent, but their enjoyment and passion were also contagious, resulting in a program that could sway even the most skeptical opera critic.

Driving beats, dark vocals, and disorienting fog filled Bloomfield music venue brillobox last Tuesday for a concert by synthpop duo Trust.
A Toronto-based duo comprised of singer Robert Alfons and drummer Maya Postepski (of pop group Austra), Trust performed on Tuesday with a third performing member on the keyboard. The group formed in 2009 and released its debut LP TRST in February 2012, receiving generally positive reviews.
Trust relies on goth and post-punk influences to create a heavier sound than the genre tag “synthpop” might suggest. With deep, nasally vocals and relentless beats, Trust’s music carries a superficial aura of darkness — reminiscent of ’90s synth groups and current bands like Crystal Castles — and creates a faint feeling of nostalgia in the listener, though for what is unclear.
Brooklyn-based rock band Eraas and Pittsburgh-based synthpop group Ennui opened for Trust, though most of the audience didn’t show up until just before Trust’s set. The crowd — made up entirely of hip twentysomethings — was enthusiastic; there were lots of applause and verbal affirmations of enjoyment, despite a surprising lack of dancing. The shift from light head-bobbing to more involved movement happened only during Trust’s most popular songs, like “Bulbform,” “Heaven,” “F.T.F.,” and “Sulk.”
The show at brillobox on Tuesday was both a visually and aurally immersive experience. A fog machine was blowing throughout the show, and the drummer and keyboardist were in sync with a strobe light, making it easy to get lost in the show. Colored lights lit the stage from behind, creating a disorienting silhouetted effect; the black outline of lead singer Alfons hopped around the front of the stage throughout the set, but that was really all you could see from the dance floor.
Trust opened the show with crowd-favorite “Shoom” — a sprawling song that combines every great element of the group into five-and-a-half minutes you wish would never end — and played nearly every other song from their debut album, coming back on stage for a single-song encore after their set. The music translated well into a live set, but the show lacked some of the energy and depth of the album. The balance seemed off during part of the show, with low vocals and overpowering beats. Alfons’ deep, brooding voice — a defining characteristic off the band’s songs — sounded fine live, though less clean than on the album, which perhaps contributed to the show’s lack of energy.
With just one album and a few singles out to date, the show could have been a dud, with nothing new brought to the table. But the immersive visuals and the quality of the live instrumentation and vocals made the show a success. In all, it was a night of great performances, and Trust certainly lived up to the hype they’ve been riding on for over a year.

Dear Patrick,
On the way back from my spring break road trip, I bought some “legal” fireworks. Nothing too crazy — just some M-80s and Roman candles they were selling behind a gas station in Tennessee at 4 a.m. How can I make the best use of these? I would prefer to keep all my fingers and stay out of jail, so keep that in mind.
Thanks,
Freely Igniting Rogue Explosives, Careful, Rockets Are Cool, Kids Enjoy Detonations
Dear FIRECRACKED,
Nothing lights up a young man’s heart more than fireworks. Not fame, fortune, or a sidelong glance from a lovely lady. No, that rocket’s red glare as it burst in the sky reminds you that this is America: Our national anthem has explosions and so should our daily lives! You can pry my cherry bombs out of my cold, dead hands, Obama!
Though it may seem like a fun and hilarious mix, you should keep fireworks and alcohol away from each other. Sure, alcohol makes everything better, but you probably want to be thinking straight when you play with explosives. Before you do anything, just think to yourself, “Does this sound like the first half of a Darwin Award nomination?” 
Be sure to put it on YouTube too,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
A while ago, you wrote about your amazing dance moves. I added them into my rotation, but women have not yet started throwing themselves at me. Are your dance moves all they’re chalked up to be? If women aren’t throwing themselves at me, how am I supposed to dance with them? And don’t say something crazy like walk up to them.
Thanks,
Shimmying Obnoxiously Lonely, Other Temptresses Avoid, Need Gamboling Opinions
Dear SOLO TANGO,
Hold your horses right there, bucko. Don’t go throwing blame on my famous dance moves, renowned throughout multiple states. Clearly you are not dancing properly. How much are you waving your arms around? If the answer’s not “a lot,” you’re doing it wrong. You should stop just short of punching your neighbors in the face. Nothing rocks harder than an epileptic fit.
If the women are somehow resisting your amazing moves, which I must stress is impossible, then you may have to show some initiative. Once you’ve got people’s attention, you can show them how you trip the light fantastic.
Just don’t actually trip,
Patrick Hoskins

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey
The Hobbit is Peter Jackson’s long-awaited return to Tolkien’s Middle Earth. He has a solid cast, some returning members, and his reliably beautiful cinematography — but why such a God-awful movie? Of course, the first reason is that it favors technology over narrative. The discussion surrounding the film is never about Bilbo; it’s about the brilliant CGI and 48FPS projection rate. Though I appreciate the goofiness of the opening (so much singing and plate tossing), the injection of comic timing courtesy of Martin Freeman, and the somewhat more prevalent levity, there’s only so many deus ex machina I can take: Gandalf apparently can stomp his staff and cause everyone in the room to fall down. Those endless swirling helicopter shots of people crossing mountains have returned, and it’s impossible for me not to giggle at (subtitled) orcs furious at “elvish filth” and “dwarfish scum.” It’s ultimately patience-testing and not nearly as thrilling as intended. But you can go for the special effects.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Jackson’s take on the Shire is considerably more happy-go-lucky than Tolkien fans might expect; the fireworks are grand, but life for the Hobbits is strangely akin to an Irish jig. Despite the Shire’s exaggerated sense of joy and normalcy, Jackson has stunningly authenticated Tolkien’s mythic landscape. Blue waters wash against flowery green pastures. There is a sense of belonging here, as if we’ve finally stumbled across that old friend we’ve only seen in dreams and read about in the thumb-worn pages of Tolkien’s novels. At three hours, Fellowship of the Ring soars, its pitfalls miniscule when compared to the jaw-dropping splendor of its remarkable set pieces. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring stars Elijah Wood, Ian McKellan, and a host of other spectacular supporting players. It is the finest entry into the trilogy and is not to be missed.

Carnegie Mellon University in currently in the midst of a search process for a new vice president and chief financial officer.
The position of vice president and chief financial officer (CFO) — a singular position — organizes the central financial services of the university, including the budget, payroll, accounts receivable and payable, the treasurer’s office, internal audits, and sponsored projects.
According to current Vice President of Campus Affairs and search committee chair Michael Murphy, “One very important facet of the role beyond his or her immediate organization … is collaborative involvement and leadership in the whole of the administration. President Jared Cohon and Executive Vice President and Provost Mark Kamlet have nurtured this kind of teamwork exceptionally, in the best Carnegie Mellon tradition.” 
Mark Kamlet is the current interim CFO.
Specific duties of the CFO position include issues such as proposing tuition and fees, negotiating research overhead rates, developing budget plans, advising on property acquisition, and monitoring the effectiveness of international initiatives.
“It is a critical role, if perhaps somewhat less visible to students than some,” Murphy continued.
Although many students are unfamiliar with the responsibilities of the CFO, his or her actions play a vital role in the university’s day-to-day activity. When approached, most students were eager to learn more about the role of the CFO and to give their opinion regarding the position.
First-year logic and computation major Deanna Daly said, “I hope that the new vice president is one who really considers the position of individuals, and not just the institution as a whole. Even though we are getting a great education, being a student here is financially straining on our families, and I think that really has an impact on student lifestyle. This is definitely something that I’m hoping to see improved.”
The search committee is looking for a candidate who has the proper educational background and financial expertise. 
The committee believes an ideal applicant to be someone who has leadership experience, a strategic and insightful mind, excitement regarding the accomplishments and potential of the university, and a dedication to building an environment in which the community can thrive.
“Carnegie Mellon is a complex organization … and is still young and has comparatively lesser resources than many of our peers. We play big for our size, as they say, and that requires someone who is smart, hard working, and innovative,” Murphy said.
The search process for the new CFO began this past November with the development of the search committee, and the search firm was selected in January. 
Applications and nominations are now being accepted, and interviews will be conducted later this spring. The university plans to have a new CFO working in July.
Subra Suresh, President-Elect, is involved with the process and will assume office at roughly the same time as the new CFO. 
Additionally, a small number of student leaders will probably be able to meet with finalists.
“The nature of this highly qualified position requires an individual who is diligent, organized, and conscientious,” sophomore psychology major Lauren Simicich said. 
“The expectation is for this person to assume the numerous responsibilities that are expected of them and have them completed in an efficient and timely manner,” she continued. “If they can do that with an enthusiastic attitude, then you have found your new VP and CFO.”

In response to January’s Town Hall on Carnegie Mellon culture, the student government — in conjunction with the department of student affairs — devised a strategy to combat the issues discussed. An event organized by Students for a Deliberative Democracy (S4DD) was held in the University Center’s Rangos Hall last Tuesday.
The purpose of the event, according to S4DD’s program manager and Ph.D. candidate in rhetoric Tim Dawson, was to “bring together multiple voices, multiple perspectives” and to facilitate conversation on campus stress culture.
Meela Dudley, student body vice president and creative and professional writing double major, said that January’s Town Hall “opened the flood gates of conversation.” After the Town Hall, Dudley said that student government needed “a stricter way to collect that data, but we still wanted to have a face-to-face conversation, rather than a survey.”
The event was based on a structure developed by S4DD meant to “bring more inclusive conversation to campus,” according to Justin Mando, a Ph.D. candidate in rhetoric and an officer in S4DD.
Around 80 people attended the event, Mando said.
“We asked anyone who would be interested in attending to fill out a survey form that asked why they want to attend, rate how big an issue it is, say what they think of the issues at play. We had a really big response from this, but it was also a manageable response, so we randomly selected constituents to try and get the most diverse response,” Dudley said.
S4DD, Dawson said, “helped develop surveys, helped develop background materials, helped them structure the event; we helped train moderators and note -takers.”
At the roundtable event, small discussion groups of seven or eight people were hosted at each table, assisted by a moderator and recorded by a note-taker. Afterward, there was a resource panel and a Q&A session. These mixed groups of undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty discussed questions such as “How do we maintain our high standards of a rigorous curriculum and cultivate a stronger ethic of care and community support for each other?” and “Why might students feel they need to navigate challenges without seeking help?” The questions addressed issues in the realms of academic environment, personal wellness, and how the Carnegie Mellon community defines success.
Thomas Klein, a sophomore computer science major who attended the event, talked about some of the issues discussed, such as the role of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS). 
“One of the big issues was with CAPS; people were confused about its role, what it’s supposed to provide. Another issue was student-faculty relationships — is it okay to reach out to students, if students want that? Both students and faculty agreed that it would be beneficial to have this stronger bond.”
Klein said that he thought the event was “overall pretty helpful.”
Gina Casalegno, dean of student affairs, said that there are several measures already being put into effect. “The health center is offering a pilot group discussion program at the end of the semester. Not group therapy, but more like Alcoholics Anonymous meetings; much more a peer support group than directed group therapy. ”
Casalegno also discussed other measures already put in place to combat stress culture outside of student affairs and student government. “In some residence halls, RAs and CAs have started weekly discussion groups…. There are many grassroots experiences that are occurring in residence hall and Greek life communities.”
Casalegno talked about the academic side of the issue. “We’re trying to see what we can be doing from an advising side, what we can do to help students with course registration, see how [students] sequence courses or put courses together in a current semester — see if we are still capturing the right workload with course credits.”
Dudley also mentioned the student government’s plan to work with organizations already trying to combat stress culture. “We wanted to make sure those groups that already had ideas on how to help stress had support, and that people knew what they were doing, as well as the resources that were being made available to students....The student government is currently working on putting together a database of those organizations. We’re working with CAPS right now and Health Services to make a place on the Internet where there can be a directory of all these kinds of resources.”
There will also be, Dudley said, a fund for organizations with ideas to combat stress culture. “It’s kind of like a grant fund where organizations can apply to the dean’s office, but you can apply with proposals, specific projects that you want funding for that will attack this issue. Anyone can apply for it.”
When asked about future events, Dudley was clear that they would be diverse. “Yes, we’re going to have to try to have more Town Halls, but we’re also going to balance it with these more moderated discussion events that provide more organized and concrete data for addressing exactly what these problems are.”
Casalegno followed up with the information that “we are not planning any additional deliberate democracy groups, but we haven’t made the decision that we won’t have any more in the future.”
The results of Tuesday’s event will be compiled and analyzed to come up with measures to address problems within campus culture.
“We’re compiling the answers — what are the core issues and what thoughts do people have about which areas we should most directly focus on as their immediate priorities,” Casalegno said.

Carnegie Mellon teamed up with the National Security Agency (NSA) to create a high school hacking competition known as “Toaster Wars,” which takes place April 26 to May 6. 
Sponsored by the NSA and supported by Carnegie Mellon’s own hacking group, the Plaid Parliament of Pwning (PPP), Toaster Wars has been developed into a high-profile hacking competition. 
It came into being through a large amount of effort put forth by PPP and the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC).
Formed in 2009, the PPP is self-described as a security interest group. According to Tyler Nighswander, senior computer science and physics double major and also one of the PPP’s leaders, the group often creates and competes in Capture the Flag hacking exercises.
“We create security puzzle type things for exploitation, hacking, et cetera,” Nightswander explained. “Then we go in, break into stuff, and hack into things.”
The PPP’s  adviser and an assistant electrical and computer engineering professor David Brumley notes the PPP’s success. “PPP is actually ranked in the world for security research groups, even [among] professional teams.” It has competed in various contests, and its next competition is to be held in South Korea. “A lot of people would be interested in computer security from this opportunity,” Brumley said.
As a part of the Toaster Wars competition, high school hackers will be given a scenario in which they are told to use their hacking skills to repair a robot from space and to figure out some of his secrets.
According to the competition’s official website, “The competition is a series of challenges centered around a unique story line where participants must reverse engineer, break, hack, decrypt, or do whatever it takes to solve the challenge. The challenges are all set up with the intent of being hacked, making it an excellent, legal way to get hands-on experience.”
Kaiyang Zhang, a master’s student in entertainment technology who helped create the Toaster Wars competition, said, “We think it’s a bit hard for high school students to give a theme and get them interested, so they can learn it and progress.”
Danielle Corporon, a master’s student in entertainment technology, feels that, “We chose to develop the game for all ages, so kids, for example, don’t think its limited to younger kids.”
The competition, therefore, was developed to encourage high school students to participate in and enjoy the competition. Additionally, the contest will also help students “learn how to identify security vulnerabilities and perform real-world attacks.” 
The hope is that it will also encourage interest in computer science and its applications to cyber security. 
“Learning computer science in school is important to real-life situations,” said Tim McMullan, a master’s student in entertainment technology.
Brumley agreed and added that he has expectations for more people to be interested in cyber security. 
“A lot of people [are] interested in computer security. Our college kids have siblings, [so] hopefully we’ll have [more] people interested.”
In addition to their financial sponsorship, the NSA has also been a vocal supporter of the Toaster Wars hacking competition. 
NSA representative Vanee Vines told the Associated Press, “America increasingly needs professionals with highly technical cyber skills to help keep the country safe today — and to help the country meet future challenges and adapt with greater agility. When it comes to national security, there is no substitute for a dedicated, immensely talented workforce. We need the best and brightest to help us out-think and defeat our adversaries’ new ideas.”
Toaster Wars has gained national attention for its efforts, receiving coverage from major news outlets such as NBC News.

With student government elections less than a week away, students can look forward to hearing candidates for Student Senate outline their platforms during debates, which will be held today and tomorrow.
Debates for the positions of student body president (SBP) and vice president (SBVP) will be held on Monday from 6–7:20 p.m. in McConomy Auditorium, and debates for student body vice president for finance (SBVPF) and student body vice president for organizations (SBVPO) will be held on Tuesday 6:30–9:30 p.m. in Rangos 3.
Polls will open online March 28 at noon and will close April 2 at 6 p.m.
Two tickets are running for student body president and vice president. Junior biology major Lindsay MacGillivray and sophomore social and decision sciences and philosophy double major Peter Masters are running together; junior mechanical engineering and engineering and public policy double major Thomas Healy and junior business major Caitlin Jones run on the other ticket.
Neither pair has submitted an official platform to the student government elections website.
The candidates for SBVPF are sophomore statistics major Jalen Poteat and sophomore psychology major Joshua Swanson.
While Poteat has not submitted a formal platform to the official elections website, Swanson stated, “One of my first priorities would be to immediately find out how students feel about the various activities offered on campus. I want to know what you want to see more or less of, how you think your money should be allocated, and what groups think about the process involved with applying for, receiving, and using funding.”
He went on to state that he hopes to improve communication between the Joint Funding Committee (JFC) and organizations during the activities budget approval process.
The candidates for SBVPO are sophomore business major Susanna Park, sophomore economics major Radowan Khan, and junior psychology and decision science double major Corinne Rockoff. None of these candidates has submitted a formal platform.
The VPF debate will begin at 6:30 p.m. while the VPO debate is scheduled to begin at 8:00 pm. During these events, the moderator will present candidates with presubmitted questions and give them a limited time to respond.
Additionally, the candidates will have a period where they can openly discuss issues among themselves without restrictions on speaking order or individual time. 
Finally, there will be a period where the candidates will accept and answer audience questions.
To run for an executive office, a student must obtain signatures from at least 100 current undergraduate or graduate students. 
Candidates for Student Senate must provide a petition with at least 25 signatures from members of their college.
According to the official position descriptions, the SBP must act as “an advocate for Carnegie Mellon students both on and off campus, and oversees the running of the Executive Branch of student government.” The president is assisted in this job by the vice president. The SBVPF is in charge of the Joint Funding Committee, which allocates funding to Carnegie Mellon student organizations.
SBVPO is “responsible for overseeing, advising, and advocating for student organizations,” as well as serving as chair of the Committee on Student Organizations, which oversees the process for recognizing student organizations.
In response to the elections, students stated that they desire student body leaders who understand the community well in order to accurately represent Carnegie Mellon as a whole.
Senior composition major Eric Dietz said, “I think the most important thing in a student body president is someone who knows the CMU community and can engage with many students across our departments and understand their mindsets. Because if you have a good handle on most everything, you can lead sort of from the inside, and I think that’s an important factor.”
First-year international relations and politics major Ariel Lee agreed. “I think the student body president should be someone who recognizes and fairly represents all sectors of our school—someone who knows about different departments, and doesn’t only have one perspective on the community.”
Lee went on to stress the importance of having leaders who understand the tense academic environment of the school. 
“Especially in light of recent discussions about CMU’s stress culture, it would be nice to have a leader who realizes that stress is an issue, and be able to help solve that problem. Because the happiness of students is important not only to maximize on our education, but also to help stimulate personal growth.”

After the highly publicized trial surrounding the Steubenville rape case, where a 16-year-old girl was raped at a party by two high school football players, it's natural that the media had an immediate response to the rapists’ sentencing. Their response, however, was less than ideal.
Rather than bemoan the fact that these rapists received the minimum sentence — both serving a year for the rape and one serving another year for circulating pictures of the rape — major news outlets like CNN grieved the guilty verdict. CNN correspondent Poppy Harlow, while reporting from the scene, stated how difficult it was to watch "as these two young men, [who] had such promising futures — star football players, very good students — literally watched as they believed their [lives] fell apart."
The judge of the case mentioned that "this is the problem with social media." A correspondent for NBC again emphasized the sadness of the future of the rapists: "Both boys had promising football careers — Mays the quarterback, Richmond the receiver — on the beloved high school team and dreams of college. In court, their lawyers and parents pleaded with the judge not to impose a harsh sentence."
In what world is this a proper reaction to a rape sentencing? Despite how promising their careers may have seemed before this trial, the guilty verdict is not what ruined their futures. What ruined their futures was their decision to commit a rape.
A boy can be a football star and an excellent student, but that doesn't mean anything if he is also a rapist. These boys made the conscious decision to take advantage of a girl and brag about it on social media, and none of that says "promising future." They committed the crime and they should have to pay the consequences for their actions. A few years in jail and registration as juvenile sex offenders is a lighter sentence than they would have gotten had they been tried as adults.
The most disturbing part of these reactions is not the fact that they happened, but the fact that they happen so frequently. As a country, we decry India and Egypt for being rape friendly, but we close our eyes to what happens on our own soil. The reaction to the Steubenville case was abhorrent, but it was not unusual. 
When someone tries to take their rapist to court, it is common for rape apologists to come out of the woodwork to ask questions and draw conclusions that don't matter. "What were you wearing? Were you drunk? Do you have casual sex? Did you lead him on? Was it really rape, or just sex that you regretted in the morning?" These are just a few questions that rape survivors must answer — it’s no surprise that 97 percent of rapists never spend a day in jail, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN).
The reaction to rape needs to change. It's sickening to live in a country so saturated in rape culture that we blame the victims for ruining the lives of the rapists. 
Without a drastic change in the way we react to cases of rape, there is no way we can change anything else about the crime; everything from how often rape is committed to how many rapes go unreported is a direct result of valuing the rapist over the victim. In a report published by the U.S. Department of Justice, women admitted that they feared reprimands from police officers for reporting an incident.
Rape is a problem in America, and it's clear from the reactions to the Steubenville case that people don't even realize it.

After a series of shootings last year — including those in Aurora, Colo. and Newtown, Conn. — several nationwide efforts were made to improve America’s relaxed gun legislation and enforcement, especially on the federal level. However, there are also detractors and gun advocates who have been critical of these changes.
Last month, one Colorado sheriff, John Cooke, said that he would not enforce two gun-control laws that would be signed by governor John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.). Cooke called these laws “feel-good, knee-jerk reactions that are unenforceable.” Other Colorado sheriffs have made similar statements, while sheriffs in other states, such as Oregon and Kentucky, stated that they will not enforce federal gun legislation.
The stance that these sheriffs have taken is highly problematic. Such officials are supposed to enforce the law to the best of their ability. Refusing to enforce laws, or only enforcing certain laws, is akin to teachers refusing to teach or doctors refusing to treat people. Unless there are very good reasons for their actions, sheriffs refusing to enforce the law are not doing their jobs.
In the case of Colorado, the laws in question aim to expand background searches and limit ammunition magazines to 15 rounds. Enforcing these laws would not require the sheriff to actually track down and confiscate guns; rather, they only require that one makes sure vendors are properly filing paperwork, and that they are not selling too many rounds. There is no good reason why these laws cannot be enforced.
Although Colorado has been traditionally known for its “cowboy” culture, it is surprising to me how resistant some of its citizens have been to gun enforcement laws, especially considering last year's deadly theater shooting in Aurora.
This intransigence is a testament to how deeply entrenched gun culture is in certain parts of America. Many of the new gun legislation laws certainly do not nullify the second amendment, but it seems like they have nonetheless stirred mistrust and panic in gun aficionados.
There is an almost irrational fear among gun lovers. Consider the recent increase in gun purchases made, as evidenced by The New York Times, after Vice President Joe Biden announced that he would propose measures to curb gun violence. He did not actually propose the measures, but simply announced that he would propose them.
To reduce gun violence and better regulate the sale of firearms, the policy required is simple — stricter background checks, a national gun registry, and the tracking of guns over time. The real challenge may lie in confronting die-hard gun advocates and changing America’s gun culture.

This isn’t your father’s Republican Party anymore. America is going through a typical shift: After a party gets trounced in an election cycle, new faces emerge, new messages make their way to the surface, and the old ones get phased out.
Senator Rand Paul’s (R-Ky.) 13 -hour filibuster and Senator John McCain’s (R-Ariz.) reaction exemplify this emerging divide perfectly. After Attorney General Eric Holder declared that it would be within presidential rights to call a drone strike upon a U.S. citizen who doesn’t pose an immediate threat, Paul took to the Senate floor to defend our Constitutional rights of due process. McCain later called Paul and his supporters “wacko birds.”
Remembering that, in 2008, McCain was the Republican presidential candidate (the leader of the party), it’s interesting to note that Paul is drawing a lot of new support from Republicans while McCain is slowly becoming obsolete.
Paul is a libertarian conservative and McCain is a neo-conservative. While Paul believes that the government is too big and interferes too much in day-to-day affairs, McCain believes in using big government to achieve conservative ends like national defense. 
Additionally, Paul believes in federalism. He advocates for states’ rights in issues such as marijuana legalization and gay marriage. This is the way our country started and the way the Founding Fathers intended it to be.
The shift between big government conservatives to more market-oriented libertarian conservatives is important, not only because it shows that the party is reacting to its message becoming obsolete, but also because it shows that conservative principles in America are evolving.
In the past, conservatism implied a pro-rich, racist, and bigoted attitude. Now, conservatism is beginning to imply a belief in an opportunistic society that’s true to constitutional principles.
This is a message that a lot of people want to hear. As marijuana legalization starts to garner more and more support, the Republican party could make huge strides in gaining support for itself by bringing that stance to Washington. The libertarian arm of the party is already starting to do so, but as more people like Paul emerge, the entire Republican Party may back the issue. 
The same holds true for gay marriage, which recently received historically high support (58 percent) in a poll by The Washington Post, and is now supported by Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who was a frontrunner for Romney’s vice president pick.
Politically, Republicans lose support by being the less sexy party — one of old, rich, white people. The party could gain lots of support by taking the idea of limited government and running with it. 
Libertarianism is now becoming trendy. Gary Johnson, the libertarian candidate for president in 2012, was the only presidential candidate who crowd-surfed during his campaign. 
Republicans can become the younger party of efficient government, equality of opportunity, and government reform.
The new wing of the Republican Party is starting to take shape and oust the establishments of Republicans who previously dominated the party. 
This is a good, natural shift that reflects winning policies. Paul’s filibuster and Portman’s switch to supporting gay marriage are hopefully just the first of many indicators of a broad shift in ideology for the Republican Party.

The stop-and-frisk policy of the New York Police Department (NYPD) has always walked the line between being constitutional and being illegal. Now there is a federal case that started hearing testimony this week from people affected by the policy, in order to judge which side of that divide the policy lies on.
To me, the policy has always been the epitome of our failing justice system; the fact that it is being contested and has a chance of being repealed is wonderful.
The stop-and-frisk policy, which the NYPD has been implementing for almost the entirety of New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg’s administration, is basically New York’s interpretation of the Fourth Amendment. However, instead of needing “probable cause” to search someone in New York City, anyone can be stopped and searched if there is “reasonable suspicion” that something illegal is happening — looser wording that leads to more searches.
This policy, combined with the NYPD’s quota system — 20 summons and one arrest per month — is a bad idea because it forces police officers to see crimes where there might not be any in order to avoid being humiliated by other officers. More importantly, these policies create an air of suspicion and racial profiling. 
According to  The New York Times, Hispanic and black men between the ages of 14 and 24 made up 41.6 percent of those stopped and frisked even though they only constitute 4.7 percent of the city’s population. The pressure that the stop-and-frisk policy puts on police officers leads them to make stops and arrests that are usually baseless.
The quota system and stop-and-frisk policy don’t even help fight crime, as Bloomberg and NYPD officers claim. “We were handcuffing kids for no reason,” said officer Adhyl Polanco of the NYPD’s 41st Precinct in an article published in The New York Times. In the same article, Polanco talks about a time when his commander tried to fulfill a quota by telling him to write a summons for a man without a dog license even though Polanko “did not see the dog.” When he confronted a lieutenant about it, he was stripped of his badge and gun and faced disciplinary proceedings.
The case against stop-and-frisk is a class action lawsuit that will be concerned specifically with the experiences of 11 black or biracial men and one Hispanic woman. However, it is representative of the numerous people who have been frisked by the city police without suspicion because of race. The lawsuit claims that the stop-and-frisk policy violates both the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure and the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause.
Hopefully, this lawsuit draws the line and causes the discontinuation of these baseless frisks.

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are on the rise, both nationwide and in Allegheny County. According to a recent article in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, there has been a 6 percent increase in cases of chlamydia and a 22 percent increase in cases of gonorrhea and syphilis in the county in 2012 compared to 2011.
This increase may stem from the rise in the number of people who are willing to get screened, or it may reveal an actual increase in STDs in the county. Either way, Carnegie Mellon students must remain cautious when participating in sexual activities in order to prevent the spread of STDs.
The importance of sexual protection may seem straightforward, but it cannot be stressed enough. Although some students may feel that using protection is so obvious that it doesn’t need to be discussed, 2010’s National Survey of Sexual Health and Behaviors found that only one in four acts of vaginal intercourse are condom protected in the U.S. The numbers rise to one in three among single people. However, this number still only signifies a small percentage of adults that use condoms during vaginal sex.
According to a study conducted by the American College Health Association in 2009, 61 percent of surveyed students at Carnegie Mellon engaged in either oral, vaginal, or anal sex within the past year; a survey performed by The Tartan in 2011 found the same statistic. This percentage is only slightly lower than the national average of 66.5 percent, which allows for generalization of national statistics to the Carnegie Mellon community.
Approximately 6,300 undergraduate students are currently enrolled at the university; approximately 3,800 of those people have had sex in the last year. The National Survey’s results suggest that around 2,550 of these people did not use protection during that encounter. The fact that 2,550 out of 3,800 sexually active students do not use protection is both worrying and dangerous.
Unprotected sex is a risky proposition. Students must understand these risks, and protect themselves accordingly. Condoms, dental dams, and other forms of barriers protect not only students, but also their partners. 
To protect themselves, students can take advantage of the resources and events that Student Health Services offers, such as Free Condom Friday.
As STDs are on the rise in Allegheny County, protected sex benefits everyone.

The Home Exploring Robot Butler (HERB), a product of Carnegie Mellon’s Personal Robotics Lab, recently performed the frustrating task that all Oreo lovers face — separating the cookie from the cream — as part of Nabisco's Cookies vs. Cream campaign.
In a recent YouTube performance, HERB confidently separates the two halves of an Oreo before removing the “precious cream” and wiping the cookie clean.
Although this task may not demand the abilities of an advanced robot, HERB’s newfound capabilities are an impressive feat and a step toward making robotics technology accessible to the public.
HERB’s Oreo feat brings the public into contact with the current capabilities of robotics. Director Siddhartha Srinivasa and the other researchers presented HERB as a charming robot capable of performing a relatable task, that most people have tried at least once. This choice makes the robot accesible and novel to the average citizen. HERB normally tests algorithms, software, and other technology to perform tasks in a home or business setting, but the Oreo Challenge brings the public’s attention to how advanced current robots can be.
Separating Oreo cookies from the cream seems like a deceptively simple task to a human, but there are a myriad of difficulties for a robot to overcome. First off, an Oreo is a brittle and easily breakable cookie, which meant that HERB had to be able to pull it apart firmly enough to separate the cookies, but gently enough to avoid breaking them. To further complicate matters, no Oreo cookie is the exact size as any other, so the researchers had to program HERB to figure out how to deal with each individual cookie. These tasks seem simple to people because we have fine motor control skills, but those skills are extremely difficult to replicate in robots. HERB had to preform a delicate task that had a lot of variation within it, which indicates that HERB has a great capacity for a variety of complex endeavors.
Though the separation of an Oreo cookie is a trivial matter, this achievement shows the enormous strides the scientific community has made in recent years. Splitting the cookie from the cream is only the beginning of an exciting new age in robotics.

Carnegie Mellon has a number of programs that focus on developing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education for youth in the Pittsburgh area. An example of these programs is C-MITES, where children from kindergarten to 10th grade attend summer camps on campus to learn skills in the STEM fields.
Programs like C-MITES are an effective way to promote programming education for younger students, which will prove to be a vital skill in the future job market.
Another program is the picoCTF, a competition that teaches high school students hacking and computer security. The program then challenges students to improve those skills.
According to a Carnegie Mellon press release, “Students participating get hands-on experience in security topics such as cryptography and codes, computer bugs, exploits, and defenses.” The competition, hosted by Carnegie Mellon-affiliated organizations Team Osiris and the Plaid Parliament of Pwning, looks to cater to students of all skill levels.
In a world where technology is an increasingly important and prevalent part of everyday life, technological illiteracy may turn into a major barrier to overcome. 
The demand for programmers in the workforce is skyrocketing: 1 million jobs in the tech sector may remain vacant because of the lack of people with programming skills, according to code.org. There are elements of basic programming that can be applied to any career path one pursues. Programming fosters the ability to develop algorithms and enhance one’s capacity to apply logic to problems.
Too many students are entering the workforce with little-to-no knowledge of basic computer programming. Events like picoCTF and programs such as C-MITES help combat this, and are crucial to changing the idea that programming education isn’t important enough to start teaching before college.

This week marks the start of the 2013 Student Government Elections. This is an important time in the year that gives you the power to make a positive impact in the community here. Over my four years, I’ve seen a lot of progress in student government and the continuation of that progress begins with this election. I hope you will agree with me that the size, publicity, and impact of student government has been on an upward trajectory this year. Student involvement in this election will ensure that progress continues.
For those of you who were here during last year’s elections, there was, unfortunately, a great deal of turmoil and controversy surrounding the elections. I’m glad that this year there is a much less contentious environment, but I do not want that to detract from the attention that was paid to that election, which had the highest turnout in recent memory. I urge those of you who read this to not only do your part and vote in the election, but to also remind your friends and classmates to vote as well. There are a small number of positions you will be voting on and voting itself is online, so making your voice heard is a very small time commitment that has an important impact. The winning margin last year for President was 64 votes. The year before the margin was 50 votes. Given low turnout rates in the past, this means extra votes really do have tremendous power in this election.
As an undergraduate in the election, you are able to vote for Student Senators to represent your college. All students are able to vote for president, vice president for finance, and vice president for organizations. There are great candidates running for these positions and I urge you to attend the debates today and tomorrow to learn more about them and their platforms. Within these three positions, there is a tremendous amount of power, as those who fill the positions advocate for students with the administration, manage student organization recognition, and decide funding among many other duties. I can say on behalf of all student government execs that these positions all hold very meaningful responsibilities that require a lot of dedication from the winner. By voting you are not only choosing who you want to take on those responsibilities, but you are ensuring they are held accountable. By voting for one of these excellent candidates you are helping to positively shape your CMU experience.
Voting will open this Thursday at noon. Before then you can read up on the candidates’ platforms at cmu.edu/studentvote — the same link where you can vote. To get more informed please attend the debates, which are hosted by The Tartan: Student Body President is today in McConomy at 6 p.m. Vice President for Finance is tomorrow at 6:30 p.m. and Vice President for Organizations is directly after that at 8:00 p.m. Both of those debates are in Rangos 3. I wish the best of luck to all of the candidates involved and am excited to see what next year holds for student government.
Will Weiner
Student Body President
Chair: Elections Board
