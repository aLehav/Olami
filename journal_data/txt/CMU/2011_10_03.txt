This week The Tartan had the opportunity to catch up with Sam Thompson, a junior football player from Alcoa, Tenn. He began playing football in seventh grade for his middle school team, and continued playing in high school. 
Thompson started off playing safety but was moved to cornerback his first year, and has played the position ever since.
Thompson currently studies mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon. Upon graduation, Thompson wants to become a pilot in the Marine Corps. For football, Thompson’s goals for this season include winning the UAA and finishing with an 8–2 record.
Thompson is a dynamic student athlete; he not only excels on the field and in the classroom but is also a member of Carnegie Mellon’s NROTC unit. “One of the reasons I came to CMU was the great relationship between the football team and the NROTC unit. Both organizations are great to be a part of and they accommodate each other well. They don’t fight over my time too much which allows me to participate in both while doing school on the side,” Thompson said.
“The thing I enjoy the most is being able to compete and continue to play this great game. Additionally, some of my best friends here at CMU are on the football team,” Thompson said.
Thompson went on to share some of his favorite moments of Carnegie Mellon football. “My proudest moment was probably knocking down a 4th down pass at Wittenberg my freshman year. It was my first game as a starter against a nationally ranked team,” Thompson commented. 
“My funniest moment was picking off a pass during practice and doing an end zone celebration dance before giving the ball back to the scout team QB. I thought practice was kind of lethargic and the team needed some energy.”

Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer got back on track last Wednesday after its loss to Washington and Jefferson as the Tartans took the reins and beat Denison University 1–0 at home. In the Washington and Jefferson game, Carnegie Mellon had trouble converting its offensive moves into goals. The Tartans had 10 shots on goal, but all were denied. Washington and Jefferson was able to get two goals off the Tartans, and that was more than enough to win the game.
The Tartans had a strong start to Wednesday’s game and a home field advantage. Denison had a strong record of 4–3–1 while the Tartans were at 5–3 prior to the game.
This was a big game for junior Brianna Magill, as she was able to score her second goal of the season. Carnegie Mellon goalie sophomore Anna Albi had a great game, with two saves that kept the Big Red at zero.
In the second half, both teams stepped up the defense, making it difficult for either team to create scoring opportunities. This resulted in the teams only taking two shots each on the goal throughout the entire half.
“It was great to win the game against Denison; it was a boost of confidence for the team and we are back on track,” said junior Stephanie Hare. “Now we are focusing on our UAA games.”
The Tartans now begin their University Athletic Association games. The first UAA rival for the Tartans was No. 12, Washington University in St. Louis, who they played Sunday at St. Louis.
Next Sunday the Tartans will take on the University of Chicago Maroons at home at 1:30 p.m.

With the rise in popularity of the NFL in the past decade, many people tend to forget when the MLB playoffs begin to get underway.
This past week featured probably the best day in baseball history, as two teams, the Atlanta Braves and Boston Red Sox, completed the two biggest chokes in baseball history. In fact, some experts tabbed the chances of the Red Sox missing the playoffs as a one in a million event. With the new playoff schedule, the MLB began the playoffs last Friday in order to avoid weather problems in the later months, so there is no stop to the excitement that the MLB has built in the past few weeks.
The favorite in this year’s World Series chase has to be the Philadelphia Phillies, who finished the year with baseball’s best record by a good three or four games, mostly because they have one of the best pitching rotations in the past decade. Roy Halladay, the Phillies’ ace, pitched a no-hitter in the divisional series last year, and he will be counted on to win opening games of the series and potentially the final games of the series.
Next in the Phillies’ rotation is Cliff Lee, who was the best pitcher on this year’s free agent market by far, and actually chose to sign with the Phillies over the New York Yankees for less money in the offseason. He brings a great postseason pedigree to the team, which includes a World Series championship with the Phillies, and is easily the best No. 2 starter in the playoffs. With two of the best pitchers in the league, expect the Phils to be extremely tough to beat, especially because their offense is nothing to laugh about.
The favorite in the AL has to be the New York Yankees, who had the best run differential in the league. They actually have a very different team than the Phillies, as the Yankees team is clearly based on having a high-powered offense. They feature two MVP candidates in the middle of the lineup in Curtis Granderson and Robinson Cano, two guys that scored over 100 runs and drove in over 100 runs throughout the season. They had six players who hit over 20 home runs, making the Yankee lineup the best in baseball this year.
One problem with the Yankees is that their pitching rotation is known to be pretty weak, and they will rely on the portly C.C. Sabathia. Sabathia, who will probably finish second in the AL Cy Young voting this year, can probably pitch three games in a seven game series, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he is called on to do that in a later series. However, the story of this postseason has to be rookie Ivan Nova, who led all rookies in wins this year.
In fact, Nova picked up the win on Saturday, pitching a gem to give the Yankees a 1–0 lead in a short series with the Detroit Tigers.
However, if there is one thing I have learned about the MLB playoffs in the 15 years I’ve been watching baseball, it is to expect the unexpected. Over the past 20 years, the team with the best record has only won the World Series three times. There have been multiple instances where the team that is considered the worst team in the playoffs has won it all, such as the 2005 Chicago White Sox, or either of the two Florida Marlins championship teams.
What we do know is that there will be plenty of great memories that will be made, such as the epic 2004 Boston Red Sox comeback against the Yankees, or the underdog San Francisco Giants making a historic run just last year. With the parity in the MLB right now, I can definitely see an up-and-coming team such as the Milwaukee Brewers or Tampa Bay Rays making a run for the ages and tearing up a ton of better teams.
So far, the games have been pretty uneventful, but I guess we can’t get lucky with every game. I’m hoping we get a few extra-inning games, maybe a few walk-off home runs, and maybe if we’re lucky, we’ll see the second perfect game ever thrown in the playoffs. Either way, it will be exciting, and being a Yankees fan, I hope that the Yankees win their MLB-best 28th title.

Toyota conducted an experiment in democracy last November, when the company presented the following challenge: If we gave you Toyota technologies, how could you, the public, imagine using them in a way that would benefit humanity?
The competition Ideas for Good was born in just this way, seeking plans to creatively repurpose five different Toyota technologies. Submissions lasted until the end of February 2011, at which time a panel of gurus from around the country whittled down the pool to five finalists for each technology. After public voting online in April, the company selected a winning submission for each technology.
In April, however, this national competition took on a more local Pittsburgh flavor.
Deeplocal, a Pittsburgh-based design company formed by Carnegie Mellon alumnus Nathan Martin, indicated on Twitter in April that it was teaming up with Toyota on Ideas for Good to transform the winning designs into working prototypes. Deeplocal enlisted the expertise of Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute, asking robotics professor Illah Nourkbakhsh, research engineer Josh Schapiro, and a handful of students for additional help.
“Ideas are everywhere,” Martin said in a promotional video for Ideas for Good, “but when you take an idea into the physical world you’re going to learn a lot more about it.” This was the intention behind the early June weekend of frenetic prototyping on Carnegie Mellon’s campus. “You’re going to learn some of the things you might have otherwise taken for granted,” he said.
“Pure Air,” the winning submission by inventor Tim Witmer from Houlton, Maine, repurposed Toyota’s Solar Powered Ventilation system (which normally adorns the Prius) to reduce cook stove emissions in confined spaces. Woodstoves and meat-cooking, especially when confined in huts or tents, are potent sources of ultrafine particulate emissions, which are linked to both asthma and mortality. Low-electricity fans powered by the Prius solar panel helped rapidly remove cooking emissions from a temporary hut constructed outside of the Gates Hillman Complex.
Near the hut, a fire truck was parked outside of the Gates garage, where designers and engineers used the concept of Toyota’s Advanced Parking Guidance System (APGS) to create a kind of ‘smart’ fire ladder. “The original thought was to guide the ladder without human involvement, but we scrapped that,” said Carnegie Mellon engineer Joshua Schapiro, who was a part of the project. The logistics of borrowing a fire truck from the Pittsburgh Fire Department made fully automating the system an unrealistic goal for the weekend. Instead, the team focused on collecting a robust variety of data (e.g. infrared images, temperature, and air quality), from a custom sensor-array. This information was then relayed to a computer where a firefighter could safely and intelligently guide the ladder from a distance.
The other winning technologies included the “Power Plant Gym,” which employs the hybrid drive system to harness energy from weight and cardio equipment and turn it into electricity; “Build a Better Bicycle Helmet,” which applied an injury-simulation software model to identify weaknesses in existing bike helmet design; and lastly, an ergonomic computer keyboard and mouse that use touchscreen sensor and visualization technology from Toyota steering wheels.
“Prototyping Weekend was reminiscent of a science fair for grown ups,” wrote the authors of the Deeplocal blog, reflecting on the weekend. The weekend was one of jubilation and creativity, especially for the winners of the contest, who were flown in to be a part of the event. “Carnegie Mellon is the perfect place [where] people with completely different disciplines can all come together with crazy ideas, work it out in a weekend,” said Nourkbakhsh in the Ideas for Good promo video. Three weeks ago, cmu.edu/ideas-for-good was launched. And since Toyota has donated the rights to the winning ideas to Carnegie Mellon, as well as $100,000, stay tuned for what comes next with Ideas for Good.

Four Carnegie Mellon undergraduates have won the first-ever Yahoo! Open Hack All-Stars competition with Ruum, a file-sharing web application they created. Computer science majors Chong Xie and Amos Yuen, electrical and computer engineering major Arjuna Hayes, and art major Ethan Gladding were awarded the grand prize of $10,000 for their efforts.
Their journey started in the fall semester of 2009, when Yahoo! held “HackU” tournaments, open to any college student, on college campuses around the world. The rules were simple: Within a 24-hour time constraint, the participants had to create a revolutionary computer application using Yahoo! technologies and open application programming interfaces (APIs). The same team of four (first-years, at the time) won the CMU HackU tournament with FlickrThrough, an app that takes a Flickr search and generates a photo mosaic comprised of relevant search results.
Two years later, the group found themselves at the Yahoo! Open Hack All-Stars competition in New York City, which pitted the winners of past HackU events from all around the world against each other. The groups were subject to the same constraints, but their app also had to solve a problem faced by the digital media industry. After much deliberation, the students, whose official team name throughout the competition was “D1W,” eventually settled on creating a file-sharing tool that would fill a niche between two existing file-sharing tools, Dropbox and Google Docs.
“There’s no obvious choice for when you just need a couple of files shared,” Hayes said via email. “Like if you want to work on just a few [documents, pictures, videos] ... maybe not editing them, but just communicating about them. That was sort of how we built the idea.”
This idea, after many hours and lines of coding languages such as PHP, HTML5, JQuery, and MySQL, evolved into Ruum.
“What we envisioned Ruum as was a fast, easy-to-use file sharing tool,” Hayes said. “We marketed it as a tool for publishers to share documents with their editors. In like three seconds flat, you can create a Ruum, link other people to the Ruum, and drag and drop files really easily into Ruum.... There’s a live chat, so you can chat with people about the files.”
Of course, Ruum wasn’t the only impressive application at the competition. Other interesting projects included a photo-essay generator for consuming online news articles, a media player with a song selection mechanism based on the current context (time of day, GPS location, etc.), and an iPad app to interact with content playing on a SmartTV. Reflecting on how outstanding the programs of other participants were, Hayes appreciated the effort he and his team put in to obtain this monumental achievement.
“We couldn’t have done this missing any one of us,” Hayes said. “Ethan was our secret weapon since no one else really had an artist. We had a logo and [our app] looked nice. Chong did most of the front-end, I did a little bit of the front-end, and Amos did most of the back-end. My main job was presenting.”
In contrast to the previous HackU tournaments, this competition placed a huge emphasis on the quality of the presentations each team put on, in addition to the quality of the apps they wrote.
“I had to present to the Yahoo! judges,” Hayes said. “Once we got into the top six, I had to give a 90-second presentation to the businesspeople. The idea was that the project had to be a little more business-oriented.... It had to be [marketable].”
So will we in fact see Ruum come to the marketplace anytime soon? Hayes regrets the fact that he and his teammates’ busy schedules have delayed any extensive work on the project.
“I wish I had more time to work on it,” Hayes said. “We’re going to talk to Yahoo! about possibly incubating the project.... We made it because there wasn’t anything there, and it does fill a gap. It would be something I’d like to see implemented and hopefully we can actually do that.”
Yahoo! held another HackU tournament at Carnegie Mellon this past weekend, from Sept. 30 to Oct. 1, and will be hosting the Open Hack All-Stars competition again next year.
“Hack Days are the perfect venue to create cool and innovative apps,” Yuen said in a Carnegie Mellon press release. “The opportunity to focus on a singular problem and bring a solution to life is what hacking is all about.”

Many weight loss advertisements use the word “metabolism.” Several weight loss methods claim to be able to change a person’s metabolism to help them lose weight faster and more efficiently. It’s not just weight loss advertisements that associate metabolism with weight; people often credit their metabolisms with preventing weight gain, even if they don’t have the best eating habits. What is metabolism, then, and is it responsible for a person’s weight? 
According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, “metabolism refers to all physical and chemical processes in the body that convert or use energy.” This definition makes it clear that metabolism is not a single entity or process inside a body responsible for weight control; instead, it is the group of all processes related to energy conversion and use. There could be, in fact, thousands of metabolic processes occurring in your body right now, according to KidsHealth.org. 
All of these processes can be split into two broad categories: anabolism and catabolism. Anabolism refers to the processes that create new cells and tissues in the body by putting together smaller proteins and molecules, while catabolism refers to the destructive processes of the body; they break down large carbohydrate and fat molecules in food to provide energy to cells. In short, metabolism is responsible for collecting energy from the food people eat and using it to keep them alive. Weight loss is not really an integral function of metabolism, but many people have made this association by simplifying the ideas involved. 
The Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is what most people are thinking of when they talk about metabolism in connection to weight loss. The BMR is a measure of how much energy a body uses just for its daily upkeep. Every human body needs to perform several metabolic tasks in a day just to stay alive, like ensuring circulation of blood, producing and releasing hormones, building and repairing cells, controlling body temperature, and making sure all systems in the body are functioning. These tasks happen unceasingly and are responsible for a large percentage of daily energy consumption for most people. 
According to the Mayo Clinic, the BMR stays fairly constant for most people, and can be responsible for up to three-fourths of daily calorie consumption. Different groups of people have different BMRs: large people, people with developed muscles, young people, and males generally have a higher BMR. A person with a higher BMR will burn more calories in the course of a day than someone with a lower BMR. Does this mean metabolism is in some way responsible for one’s weight?
Not exactly. Weight change is largely controlled by the body’s calorie balance. If people consume more calories than they burn, they gain weight. If they burn more calories than they consume, they lose weight. While part of this burning of calories can be due to BMR, it is also affected by one’s level of physical activity. 
Consuming the right amount of food is also important to maintaining a healthy weight. Many fad diets try to make people believe they can lose weight by increasing their metabolism either through eating at special times or by adding special ingredients to their food. However, it is important to know that BMRs, except in extreme conditions or due to disease, are stable and are unlikely to be greatly affected by tactics like this. The body has a self-regulating mechanism and is not likely to change its BMR greatly. People aiming to change their weight should focus on the food they consume and the physical activity they get if they want to see change.

Sociologists at Cornell University published a study this week analyzing mood rhythms among average people, pulling their data from Twitter. They examined messages posted between February 2008 and January 2010 by more than two million people in 84 countries. Not surprisingly, the researchers found people’s overall moods to be at their lowest at the beginning of the workweek and highest in the weekend. During the day, moods peaked around breakfast time and right after dinner, with a dip between 3 and 4 p.m., regardless of whether the day was during the workweek or weekend.

Researchers at King’s College London are one step closer to drawing a link between environmental factors and gene activity in people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The scientists looked at 22 pairs of identical twins in which one twin in each pair was diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. All twins were found to have identical DNA, but showed exterior differences on the gene sites that dictate how active they are. Similar genes with exterior differences have been previously found in lab mice, presumably inflicted by environmental factors such as stressful events and diet.

Oregon-based startup Agilyx claims that it has developed a system of converting discarded plastic into crude oil. The process consists of heating and vaporizing the plastic and condensing the vapors onto a pool of hydrocarbons that can further be converted into diesel or other fuel types. The company says that about a gallon of gas can be produced per seven to 10 pounds of plastic. A prototype of the system has been in development for about 18 months, and the company hopes to start selling commercial systems in about nine months.

Research recently presented at the European Respiratory Society’s annual congress in Amsterdam suggests that cyclists in large cities are at an increased risk of lung injury. This is due to the higher levels of black carbon, or soot, in large cities. The results of the study, which observed amounts of soot in the lungs of cyclists and pedestrians, showed that cyclists had over two times more soot in their lungs than pedestrians. The scientists suggested that this could be due to a combination of factors; cyclists have a higher inhalation rate and are closer in proximity to car exhaust than pedestrians.

Magee-Women’s Hospital of UPMC has begun using 3-D technology for mammograms. This comes as a result of an efficiency study revealing that the technology would reduce false recalls — when patients return for additional tests — by 30 percent. The hospital says that recalls occur about 10 percent of the time, but only a small fraction of those recalls actually have cancer. Most recalls occur because of overlapping tissue that is normal, so generating a 3-D image allows for this problem to be largely alleviated.

A NASA space telescope recently surveyed the sky for nearby lurking asteroids and found fewer than expected. This study, which NASA is calling the most accurate census of near-Earth asteroids to date, suggests that asteroid-induced hazards to Earth may be significantly less than previously thought. In addition to knowing the location of 90 percent of the largest, potentially mass-extinction-causing asteroids, the study also suggests there are only about 19,500 mid-size asteroids, almost 50 percent fewer than scientists had expected.

Canadian artist Marc Bell sat in the sunshine in Polish Hill, drinking an iced coffee from Lili Coffee Shop and pondering the existence of two of his main characters.
“Maybe in a general sense, I was trying to make a comedy duo,” he said, referring to the “Shrimpy and Paul” strip which populates many of the pages of his new collection, Pure Pajamas. “I mean, Shrimpy’s dynamic — Shrimpy’s very straight and flat, he doesn’t talk a lot. He’s kind of annoying and deadpan, and Paul’s always stressed out. I just present them with problems, and things get kind of convoluted.”
“There’s a lot of comedy duos where the one guy doesn’t talk,” Chicago-based artist Anders Nilsen remarked from his lawn chair beside Marc.
“Really?”
“[Stan] Laurel and [Oliver] Hardy, doesn’t one of them not talk?”
“Well, there’s also [magicians] Penn and Teller,” Bell said after a moment of thought. “But I’m pretty sure Laurel and Hardy both talk.”
Bell and Nilsen make an interesting duo themselves. Both are celebrating new releases with a road trip across the East Coast, giving out readings and book signings along the way. Nilsen recently released Big Questions, his complete graphic novel. Bell’s new collection Pure Pajamas is a collection of his work in newspapers and anthologies. Just after starting out on their tour, they had stopped in Pittsburgh on Sept. 16 to host a reading and book signing at Copacetic Comics. Located in Dobson Street in Polish Hill, the store also houses the Lili Coffee Shop and Mind Cure Records.
Bell grew up in London, Ontario, where he attended a vocational arts high school called Bealart. He then went on to study art at university. He creates comics and mixed media pieces, which have been described as “a mix of commix, high art, typography, and cartoons” by the National Post. His drawings are incredibly detailed, imaginative windows into a world full of fantastic characters and surreal landscapes. Zany text swirls throughout the images, labeling objects as a “cloud cave” or a “gnewest machtoe.”
When asked about his working process, Bell described his reliance on experimentation and impulse. “I don’t plan too much,” he explained. “I start things out trying to make a bit of a mess, then turn it into something more concrete. I start out in sort of a flimsy way and then build on that — for example, there’s a lot of collage in my work, and I use scraps and casual drawings for those, and then I concentrate on turning that into something bigger.”
Another collection of Bell’s, Hot Potatoe, was published in 2009 and is a collection of comics, mixed media, water colors, and a monograph on the author and artist’s own life, written with Matt Soucie. The book details his life, career, and even his death in 2075, which involves George Stroumboulopoulos, a small soapstone sculpture, and a case of breaking and entering. Bell reflected on his future life: “I hole up in this French hotel room, doing this laissez faire European art style, painting cupcakes, and later I go back to Canada.”
In a way, Nilsen’s own book is also a collection. Nilsen has published Big Questions in parts over the past 10 years, and as of this fall, the story is available as a whole for the first time. A haunting modern fairy tale, it has been called Nilsen’s magnum opus. One of the fascinating things about Nilsen’s work is that the plot and characters of Big Questions feel deeply rooted in reality, in spite of the many fantastical elements throughout.
When asked about the story’s 10-year development, Nilsen said that he always saw the story as a whole. “That’s one of the reasons why I like this book being out — it’s really one big story,” he said. “A lot of people thought it was just this slow, meditative little vignette, [like] it just seemed to come out of nowhere. The birds in the story came out of this weird drawing exercise that I did. Writing this story — it’s like, you are inventing it, but it feels like it’s this story that already exists in the world, and you’re trying to see it as best you can and get it down.”
The aforementioned birds are central characters in the story. Many comic artists take pains to draw their characters as individuals, but Nilsens’ birds, though very distinct characters, have no visual markers for readers to differentiate one from another. “They started out as generic birds,” he said. “I was presented with the problem of should I differentiate them, and I thought that was probably a good idea. I played around with the idea of giving them markings, but then I found that I was really interested in the fact that they’re the same. Like they’re this group that is essentially the same being.”
“_Big Questions_ is a lot about how people make meaning,” he continued. “All these little birds are watching human events unfold, and they all have different interpretations of what’s happened, and they’re all wrong. They can’t know that it’s beyond their limits to understand.” When asked about whether he knew the conclusion of the story all along, or ‘discovered’ it as he wrote it, Nilsen thought for a moment before responding, “There’s a quote I heard about the conclusion of a good story: it should feel surprising, but also inevitable. The only advantage you have as a writer is that you have time to think about it and figure it out, but to the reader it should feel obvious from the start.”
Nilsen’s unique drawing style has a strong influence on the tone of the narrative itself. His line marks are detailed and concentrated in some areas, and sparse or completely absent in others. This creates a dream-like quality, as though the characters are passing through a stark, barren plain broken by only a few places of rest. “I think it’s just the way I draw, but I am definitely aware of it informing the content of the story,” Nilsen said. “It’s sort of realistic, but I have this idea of wanting the drawings to be indifferent to the story, and to the reader.”
Nilsen and Bell both spoke about the importance and support of the artist community. “Groups of comic artists and writers, those communities existed before the internet began to play a role,” Bell said. “There was this thing called Factsheet Five — it’s gone now, probably online — it was in the ’90s, and it was this magazine that listed tons of different zines and comics. It didn’t do reviews, it just gave short blurbs, explaining what these works were, and giving addresses.”
Pittsburgh’s own ’zine community gathered two weeks ago at AIR in the Northside for the Pittsburgh Zine Fair. Another upcoming event is PIX, the Pittsburgh Indie Comic Expo, which will be running at the Guardian Storage Facility on Oct. 8 and 9 in the Northside, and will be free to the public. And of course, there is always Copacetic Comics, which houses an incredible range of graphic novels and print pieces. Boichel is extremely knowledgeable about the world and history of comics, and is always willing to inform and help visitors. The store is a valuable resource for Pittsburgh artists and comic writers themselves.
That evening at the store, readings, talks, and comic interpretations of music took place in Lili’s — as Bell explained, “[comic interpretations] started for Vice magazine — they said draw Rebel Yell, draw R.Kelly’s ‘World’s Greatest,’ and then they gave me this Bruce Springsteen song; it had so many lyrics in it I could only do part.”
Afterward, the crowd trouped upstairs to Copacetic Comics for the book signing. The store, though much larger than its previous location in Squirrel Hill, was packed with fans and comic lovers. Tables were piled high with comics and graphic novels, and Copacetic Comics’ owner Bill Boichel made his way throughout the room expertly, handing out flyers for upcoming Pittsburgh comic events and working the register.
Meeting and talking with Bell and Nilsen was an amazing experience. Both have created incredible work, and are very passionate and dedicated to their art. With them, a conversation about comics was like sitting in the middle of a crossfire: References to artists, favorite comics, obscure artworks, and inspiration shot back and forth at a high speed, revealing their knowledge and place within the supportive culture of the ’zine community.
Bell and Nilsen also offered advice to art students. “When you’re in art school, you have big ideas, but you can do a lot more with less — I would actively collect paper, and just use what was immediately around me,” Bell said, referring to his collage work.
“It’s sort of a truism in art that accidents can create the best work,” Nilsen added. “The thing about art school that has the best potential is that you get to experiment and try so many different things. Enjoy what you do, but also do it a lot. And if you have to do it a lot, do what you love. A lot. And don’t smoke crack.”

The lights were dimmed, the crowd was pumped, and two figures walked onto the stage. Someone let out a banshee-like scream of glee and the crowd started chanting, “Chromeo, woaah, Chromeo, woaah.”
With that, the lights shot on and standing before the crowd were Dave1 and P-Thugg — the kings of electrofunk and the creators of the band Chromeo. It was a Tuesday night, Sept. 28, and the band graced Pittsburgh with its presence at the intimate venue of Mr. Small’s Funhouse, an 18th century church turned concert hall. Standing beneath a Catholic-inspired arch, Dave1 and P-Thugg took a look at the crowd and then bowed their heads over their instruments.
Of course, Dave1 and P-Thugg are not the pair’s real names. Christened David Macklovitch and Patrick Gemayel, this Jewish and Arab duo formed the band  Chromeo in 2001. The band made its first breakthrough onto the music scene with the worldwide club hit “Needy Girl.” After that, Chromeo developed a tight group of faithful fans with albums like Fancy Footwork and Business Casual.
“How you doing, Pittsburgh? Can you believe this place?” said Dave1. “Can’t believe we’re playing in a church with a disco ball!” Lifting his red leather-clad arm up, he pointed to the disco ball hanging in the middle of the church’s domed ceiling and, chuckling, looked at P-Thugg. With a nod, P-Thugg flipped his white, flat bill snapback around, placed the tube for his talk box between his lips, and it was off to the races.
The opening lines to “Fancy Footwork” caused collective insanity and drew shrieks of joy from the crowd, nearly drowning out the lyrics of the song. “Two step, two step, two step,” chanted the audience. The next line had the audience singing “let her see that fancy footwork, show her you’re that type of guy” in full force. Going off the vibe of the crowd, Dave1 stood to the right of his laptop stand — which was custom-built with a glowing pair of legs in red heels and fishnet stockings where the normal metal legs would have been — and sang his heart out.
“Young boy don’t be late, this girl ain’t really got time to wait,” P-Thugg harmonized. Standing to the right of Dave1, he cut a striking figure throughout the concert. With a matching pair of glowing legs attached to the underside of the keyboard he stood in front of, he faced the crowd looking like a half-man, half-woman, technological LED-lit marvel. P-Thugg stayed behind his keyboard all evening, making music with his synthesizer and coaxing magic sounds from his talk box. While P-Thugg kept it steady, Dave1 hyped it up and played the attentive frontman, giving high-fives to the crowd and picking out adoring, hysteric fans to sing to during songs.
The duo fulfilled and surpassed expectations, playing their fans’ all-time favorites, including “Tenderoni,” “Night by Night,” “Don’t Turn the Lights On,” and “Hot Mess.” Accompanying each song was a dynamic light show that added to the drama of the moment. Green and purple lights reflected off of Dave1’s signature hipster, horn-rimmed glasses during “Needy Girl” and white light seemed to shoot out of P-Thugg’s raised hand as the song came to its end.
Although Chromeo has only been to Pittsburgh a few times, the love this crowd showed the band will no doubt bring it back soon. After the last song came to a close, Dave1 yelled, “Thank you Pittsburgh!” and he and P-Thugg disappeared off stage. The audience, however, was having none of it, and started chanting “Chromeo, woaah” hoping to coax the band out for one last song. This happened not once, not twice, but three times, and — after three encore performances — the crowd was finally satiated.
With one last goodbye, Chromeo left the stage and by 11:30 p.m. Mr. Small’s had regained a bit of its church-like austerity. The road crew came in to disassemble the stage and pack away the glowing legs while lingering fans gazed toward them, hoping to see the red-heeled legs and the kings of electrofunk again soon.

Themes can bring life to any event. They can be cute. They can be funny. They can be creative.
The theme for the recent creative writing student reading was all of the above: Walking into the creative writing room in Baker Hall 260 (also known as The Glad) last Thursday, the audience was welcomed by a handful of friendly pirates to Pirates vs. Ninjas: The Creative Writing Student Reading.
Every semester, the English department sponsors three creative writing student readings. They always have a theme, and the organizers encourage the attendees to dress up in accordance with the theme. The works read do not have to relate to the theme — it serves more as a source to allow students to be silly and have a great time.
Junior creative writing major Adriana Rodriguez, who attended the event, said, “I want to hear students read their original works — things that I have not yet been exposed to. I want to hear the different rhythms in the works.”
The Glad could not be a more ideal location for this event to take place. Its intimately sized room, book-lined walls, and use of copious wooden furniture immersed the audience in a relaxed atmosphere and a reflective mood.
The lights were turned down, and the students sharing their work — seniors Aaron Bernkopf, Ila Foley, Ines Pujos, and Danny Kane — read at a podium under a dim light. It set the mood nicely, bringing a greater sense of relaxation and tranquility into the room as the writers read aloud.
“The event is low key, and places students in a low-pressure situation. It allows us to hang out with the creative writing community,” said Foley.
Various creative works were read, such as poetry inspired by Frida Kahlo, a personal essay about the supernatural, and a poem inspired by the recent AB Lecture guest, Annie Sprinkle. All the works were inspiring and highly creative. It was nice to see the incredible talent that the students from the English department have to offer, especially since their talents tend to be publicly displayed less often than those in, say, the College of Fine Arts.
The night ended with a raffle that had random prizes, such as a map of Europe from the 1970s. Caroline Kessler, a senior creative writing major who helped to organize the event, said, “I think the night turned out really well. There was a very friendly atmosphere.” There wasn’t a large turnout, but perhaps that worked to the event’s advantage — the small crowd lent well to the intimacy of the evening.
The next creative writing student reading will take place on Nov. 3 and is sure to host another delightful theme and more wonderfully offbeat student work.

Nants ingonyama bagithi Baba! (“Here comes a lion, Father!”)
These iconic words form the intro to “Circle of Life,” the beginning of one of Walt Disney Pictures’ most beloved films of all time. Since Sept. 16, Disney fans have celebrated the theatrical re-release of The Lion King, a megahit that still holds records as the highest-grossing 2-D animated film and best-selling animated home video in history. It is a classic directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, brought to life by the vocal talents of Matthew Broderick as Simba, Jeremy Irons as Scar, and James Earl Jones as Mufasa. With a timeless story and a soundtrack made memorable by the contributions of Hans Zimmer, Elton John, Lebo M., and Tim Rice, The Lion King re-release can only be considered one of this year’s hugest successes and a milestone in cinema history.
The movie closely parallels Shakespeare’s Hamlet as it follows Simba, a young prince exiled from his kingdom after an unfortunate family death. Years after his banishment, he returns to Pride Rock to seek revenge and reclaim his throne from Scar, the scheming and manipulative uncle who nearly destroys Pride Rock in Simba’s absence. On this journey, Simba reunites with his childhood friend and later mate, Nala, and attracts the loyalty of quirky sidekicks Timon and Pumbaa. The entertaining personalities of outcast hyenas (their leader voiced by Whoopi Goldberg) still manage to amuse the masses while they tremble (and laugh uncontrollably) at the mere mention of Mufasa’s name. Zazu remains a sarcastic mentor, Scar a formidable presence, and Rafiki’s display of ninja skills are no disappointment in the latest edition of Disney’s animated classic.
But why go see a movie you’ve seen, quoted, and sung along to a thousand times before? As an adult, one is able to analyze and appreciate it as a film with many layers; there are plenty of details to discover that one might have overlooked as a toddler. For example, when Zazu sings “I’ve Got A Lovely Bunch of Coconuts,” Scar is holding a skull in his hand, a clear reference to Shakespeare’s Hamlet. One of the bugs Timon pulls out of a knothole during “Hakuna Matata” is wearing Mickey Mouse ears. In a scene shared by Timon and Pumbaa, Simba collapses on a cliff and the dust that flies into the sky forms the letters “SFX,” an abbreviation of the special-effects team that worked on that portion of the film. The Lion King is riddled with symbolism and hidden messages, and years later, audiences can still find something new in a familiar story that inspired a generation. At the very least, nostalgic adults can unite to the tunes of “Be Prepared” and “Can You Feel The Love Tonight.”
One more aspect that separates this release from the 1994 original is its conversion to 3-D. Unlike most headache-inducing films made intolerable by 3-D effects, The Lion King’s magic is not hindered by this technology. Very few scenes are shaky enough to cause mild irritation, and for those audiences who simply resist 3-D glasses, the original 2-D version was also re-released.
Not surprisingly, The Lion King has grossed $61.5 million since its Sept. 16 opening. Zimmer and Lebo M.’s African-inspired score is as powerful as ever and complements the stunning visuals beautifully. During the movie, many viewers are reminded of their own childhood connections to Simba, Mufasa, and the rest of the wonderful characters. The Lion King, whether in 2-D or 3-D, has always been an epic tale and experience to remember, and it is certainly one for which a generation of Disney lovers will always be grateful.

Despite the death of Pittsburgh’s beloved Gist Street reading series (in December 2010), a literary event called Wood-Fired Words continues to carry the Gist Street spirit, if less frequently. The third annual Wood-Fired Words took place this past Saturday in Braddock at UnSmoke Art Space.
As people filed into UnSmoke, white clouds billowed up from U.S. Steel’s Edgar Thomson plant, the only working blast furnace left from Pittsburgh’s steel era. The event officially started at 7 p.m., with the dynamic Sherrie Flick, former co-host of Gist Street, greeting friends at the door and collecting the $5 admission.
As was typical of Gist Street, everyone from college students to grandparents gathered in the large, high-ceilinged space to eat, drink, and mingle. Guests brought food and wine to share, encouraging the sense of community and camaraderie. Seven-layer dip found a home next to blueberry pie. Volunteers carried in veggie-laden pizza from Braddock’s community brick oven, which sits beside UnSmoke.
The centerpiece of the evening was a fiction reading by current writer-in-residence Josh Barkan. Recently relocated from Mexico City, Barkan is the first writer to be a part of the Into The Furnace residency, where a writer lives for up to nine months in the St. Michael’s parochial school convent in Braddock, benefiting from the town’s work ethic and energy.
The uniqueness of this writer-in-residence program was highlighted when Barkan joked that he was probably the first atheist Jew to live in the convent. He read from his first novel, Blind Speed, about Paul, the bumbling male protagonist from a family of overachievers, who is in danger of losing his teaching job at a community college in Boston. 
After the reading, the Emily Pinkerton Trio played Pinkerton’s South American compositions. Although a native of the Midwest, Pinkerton has traveled to and studied music in Chile. Bassist Layo Puentes and cajon player Lucas Savage made up the rest of the trio. 
Following the literary thread of the evening, The East End Book Exchange “popped up” a bookstore in the space as well, offering popular titles for as little as $3. Lesley Rains, the creator of the book exchange, often sells books from her own personal library. The work of John Fleenor, a local artist, was also displayed — a series of oil paintings depicting the forced smiles of news anchors.
Between the fiction, the pizza, the paintings, the South American folk music, and the mismatched books, it may have seemed like a disjointed evening. But the people — friends of Gist Street, Braddock residents, college students, artists, readers, and writers — brought different elements together in an evening of revitalization, art, and community building.

Although not widely known on the East Coast, Blind Pilot delivers an unbelievably polished, unique, and — most importantly — meaningful sophomore album with their Sept. 13 release, We Are The Tide.
The album centers around Israel Nebeker’s heavy, smooth, and passionate voice, which delivers simultaneously familiar and fresh melodies supplemented by harmonies that offer refreshing aesthetic brilliance. Yet even with such a vocal focus, the album offers subtly artful instrumentation that deftly weaves in and out of the mix just enough to create a cohesive counterpoint to Nebeker’s vocals.
Expanding from its initial duo of Nebeker on guitar and vocals and Ryan Dobrowski on drums, Blind Pilot has evolved into a fully equipped sextet of multi-talented instrumentalists featuring banjo, piano, vibraphones, trumpet, violin, and stand-up bass. Blind Pilot has achieved a fuller sound than on its debut album Three Rounds and a Sound. Though both albums credit the same six musicians, a wider expanse of creative input and influence can be felt on We Are The Tide than on the band’s previous release.
This fuller sound has helped Blind Pilot invoke a whole new level of emotion in the listener. Where Three Rounds featured largely insightful but never overpowering tracks, We Are The Tide has produced songs which stay true to previous form but also invoke hope. This optimism is achieved not just through lyrical interpretation but also through upbeat instrumentation that commands attention. Longing string and horn parts accompanied by well-placed, subtle banjo-plucking and a newfound drum propulsion accompany Nebeker’s vocals, all of which feature sufficient depth for him to believably plead, “I got wise and I got old. Not once did I fall, so don’t you now,” on the last track, “New York.”
Subtly crafted instrumentation and impeccable vocals are not the album’s only strong points. Nebeker’s lyrics also add a layer of sophistication to the album that, like many of We Are The Tide’s other features, fully reveals itself only after being played several times.
What sets We Are The Tide apart from other albums is not only its unbelievable craftsmanship and immediate beauty, but also its soul. Under each catchy melody or lonely trumpet interlude is a statement about Nebeker’s songwriting. The band’s execution is able to convey not only a certain emotion — be it pain, regret, or awe — but also the sheer depth of that emotion that human experience tends to only produce in the moment, and not in retrospect. Nebeker tells stories of love and longing as well as apparent pain, heartbreak, and sheer awe throughout the entire album that leave the listener with emotional rapture after each listen.
We Are The Tide represents the kind of music that anyone can listen to and enjoy. It is masterfully crafted, and has the capability to inspire overwhelming emotion.

Luckily I forgot to pack an alarm clock. Instead, I awoke each morning in the guesthouse to the sound of a rooster’s crow. As I climbed out of my bunk bed, I needed to do a quick reality check: You are in San Pedro, Philippines.
The pace of travel had left me disoriented. I had been taking spring semester final exams in Pittsburgh one day, and the next I was on a plane to Southeast Asia with 12 other students and one professor. My team and I had been graciously sent to San Pedro by Carnegie Mellon’s mechanical engineering and civil and environmental engineering departments to serve poor families in the Philippines.
Our local hosts were the men and women of Holiness in Jesus Christian Church (HIJCC). Each day’s itinerary was chosen by Pastor Marcelo Ramirez and professor Robert Reid and was guaranteed to challenge us and engage us with Filipino community and culture.
We devoted the majority of our energy and time toward serving communities living in “squatter” villages. The people we worked with live on low-lying parcels of land that are inundated annually by typhoon flooding. Multi-family homes constructed on plywood stilts become islands when the floodwaters rise — that is, if they don’t first collapse under the forces of fast-moving water currents and storm debris.
Our first task was to design and construct a community toilet. In most communities, the existing sewer infrastructure is simply an uncovered, one-foot-deep ditch running parallel to the streets. Ordinary evening rain showers supply enough runoff to cause the sewer ditches to overflow into the streets where children run and play barefoot. Use of the new public toilet, which resembled a Western outhouse with a concrete holding chamber beneath, would surely promote cleaner streets and a healthier community.
Our second task was to rebuild and repair several homes damaged during the previous typhoon season, using local building materials such as coconut lumber while staying within our budget. Our third task was to design a platform for a new water pump and to drill a potable water well. It was a thrill and a challenge. Water was vital to the impoverished families we served, and the pump needed to be readily accessible even during the flood season.
We spent hours designing and estimating in preparation for construction. When our materials arrived, however, the work was literally taken out of our hands. The local men hoisted the lumber and bags of cement and rushed to get to work. These Filipinos were dignified workers who appreciated our design advice, but our contribution that made the greatest impact was money to pay for building materials. Although many of us came to the Philippines expecting to get dirty by doing the physical labor ourselves, this was no Habitat for Humanity trip. It was much better for the locals to perform the construction for themselves and their families than it would have been if the americanos had done all of the work for them.
While members of my team took turns helping with the construction, I took on an equally exhausting role: keeping the children out of the way of construction. We played for hours upon hours, sometimes dodging bicycles in the streets and sometimes on a field covered with broken glass. I gave the children all of the energy I had, and by the end of each day I was drained physically as well as emotionally.
I yearned to talk to the children about their interests, but our conversations were limited to the few simple phrases that I knew in Tagalog. The language barrier proved to be a major source of frustration until I met Angelo, a 10-year-old deaf boy. Unlike the other children, he didn’t try to speak to me in Tagalog. Angelo and I communicated with each other through a language of gestures, and we became the best of friends.
The Philippines are plagued by poverty, high unemployment, and homelessness. It is estimated that at least 1.5 million children nationwide have been abandoned by their families and live on the streets. This statistic became very real to me when a six-year-old boy walked up to me one night trying to sell me a necklace of sampaguitas, the aromatic national flower of the Philippines. A series of events unfolded which ended with me spending all of the money in my pockets on food for him and a dozen other children who sleep on the streets. I felt helpless and nearly hopeless.
Hope came near the end of our trip when we visited two orphanages supported by HIJCC called Ang Bahay Parola (ABP), meaning “lighthouse.” I had never been to an orphanage before, but I’ve watched the movie Annie several times and expected the orphans we visited to be sad and depressed. On the contrary, the boys and girls of ABP were some of the most blessed and joyful children we met in all of the Philippines. Unlike the street children, the ABP kids were loved and cared for by attentive staff and dreamt of going to college. Hearing each child’s unique story of renewal showed me that, although poverty seems insurmountable, even small acts of love make a large difference.

Dear Patrick,
I woke up this morning with a large lump on the back of my head, a puddle of blood on my bathroom floor, and a Browning semi-automatic with two bullets missing from the clip in my hand. I can’t find a body, there’s police sirens in the background, and someone cut my face out of all my family photos. 
Please help,
Whatever Help is Available To Divulge Is Desperately, Increasingly Desired at Once
Dear WHAT DID I DO,
This can all be easily explained. Last night, you cut yourself shaving, resulting in a large puddle of blood on the floor. Out of toilet paper, you decided to cut your face out of all your family photos to use as bandaids. As an American, you proudly own a gun, but are too poor to afford a full magazine, so you stopped two bullets short. You woke up in the middle of the night to pee, but slipped on the puddle of blood on the floor and bumped your head.
Okay, did the cops buy it? Good. Go to the airport and get on the first plane to Mexico. If you don’t have a passport or visa, go somewhere along the border. Then sneak across. Go to Zihuatanejo, Mexico. Get an old boat and start to fix it up. Open a bar. Never speak of your past.
If you’re in jail, invest in a rock hammer,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I just bought this sweet fedora! I wanted something that’ll make me look classy, and I think no one looks classier than Don Draper. The only problem is I don’t have anything to go with it (other than my xkcd shirts). Do you have any tips for fedora accessories?
Thanks,
Looking for Outfits, Nice Ensembles, Low-cost Yet still Nice; Enjoying Resembling Draper
Dear LONELY NERD,
There’s one key accessory for any fedora: a time machine. Hop in with your fedora, and go back to the 1960s. Then your fedora will actually be in fashion! You’re not Don Draper; you’re a 20-year-old guy in 2011. Fedoras only look good when you’re wearing a suit, and they leave your hair greasy if you wear them for more than 20 minutes. They went out of fashion for a reason.
However, looking classy is a good goal. The first and easiest way to do it is to trim that neck beard! Either go clean-shaven, or have a nice-looking beard. No mustaches, and no neck beards. Shower regularly. With soap. Buy some nice button-downs and slacks. Most importantly, get clothes that fit. Also, use deodorant. Lots of deodorant.
Seriously, no neck beards,
Patrick Hoskins

Most of my free time is spent reading music blogs and talking about new music with the people around me. Recently, the topic of buzzbands has been coming up pretty often. My friends are sick of reading about buzzbands, sick of hearing about them on Pitchfork, sick of obsessing over them and then forgetting them a month later. It’s a weird, endless cycle of mediocre bands gaining temporary fans and then being replaced almost immediately by some newer, cooler band.
But is that really what’s going on here? I’m not convinced that all buzzbands are so bad. In fact, I think there are some great bands out there that are being unjustly overlooked and forgotten as a result of their status as “buzzbands.” I’ve seen countless articles online mocking buzzbands and even providing step-by-step guides to becoming a buzzband. I’ve seen writers try to undermine hipster media by publishing scathing satires of what it means to be a buzzband. But this just seems silly to me. A lot of bands that were once classified under the apparently reputation-ruining label of “buzzbands” are actually talented musicians putting out quality music.
Buzzbands have a bad reputation because people make unwarranted assumptions about them. People assume they aren’t actually very talented or that they won’t matter in a month, so why bother? But the reality is that buzzbands do more than occupy the blogosphere for a few weeks. They can use their newfound fan base as a way to get noticed by record labels, which puts them in a position to grow as musicians and put out more music with better production and professional promotion. Bands like Girls, Twin Sister, Real Estate, and Neon Indian are prime examples of genuinely talented artists who have continued making quality music despite their previous status as buzzbands. So next time you find yourself rolling your eyes at some new, hip artist on Pitchfork, stop and give them a fair listen instead of immediately writing them off. You might be surprised.

Despite what its name suggests, Animal Kingdom is not a documentary about the Disney theme park of the same name — far from it. Rather, Animal Kingdom is an Australian film about Joshua “J” Cody (James Frecheville), a teenager who has to move in with his criminal relatives after his mother dies. As his grandmother (Jacki Weaver) and three uncles (Joel Edgerton, Luke Ford, and Ben Mendelsohn) engage in an all-out war with the Armed Robbery Squad, J finds himself caught in the middle and has to figure out how to get himself out.

The most recent film in the X-Men series, X-Men: First Class delves into the background of mutants Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender). Interestingly, the two had great control over their mutant abilities when they became friends, and they use their abilities to find and train new mutants. Xavier and Lehnsherr also ally themselves with the U.S. government to try to prevent the war that villain (and mutant) Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) is trying to start.

The existence of mutants with special abilities has come into the public eye, and the government is dicussing how to approach the new population. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), a mutant with telepathic abilities, tries to encourage peaceful coexistence while his old friend Erik Lehnsherr (Ian McKellen), now known as the villain Magneto, tries to even the playing field between mutants and humans. Magneto’s plan to come out ahead in this upcoming war involves the clawed and aggressive Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and the young, energy-absorbing Rogue (Anna Paquin).

100 YEARS AGO — Oct. 5, 1911
A writer decides to calculate the amount of money that students spend in a year to study at Carnegie Tech and determines that 600 students would collectively spend $246,460, equaling about $410 per student a year. Nowadays, that wouldn’t even get you one class at Carnegie Mellon, let alone a whole semester.
50 YEARS AGO — Oct. 4, 1961
The front page announces the upcoming dedication of the new Hunt Library. The university president is quoted as saying that the Hunt Library provides “an environment that is inviting and conducive to studying.” I wonder how conducive to studying he would think the library is now that it’s been turned into Club Hunt.
25 YEARS AGO — Oct. 7, 1986
In a letter to the editor, two fraternity brothers argue that Animal House doesn’t paint an accurate picture of fraternities, and accuse The Tartan of giving “major headlines to the occasional bad sides (such as alleged stabbings) of fraternity life.” Gee, I wonder why someone getting stabbed would get front-page coverage over a fraternity’s service projects.
10 YEARS AGO — Oct. 1, 2001
The Arts & Living section documents a performance art piece that took place in a men’s bathroom in the University Center. A student sat in one of the stalls with a table balanced on his lap and proceeded to enjoy a full gourmet meal. Today, you’re probably more likely find a student in the bathroom with a computer on his lap, coding.
FIVE YEARS AGO — Oct. 2, 2006
A Tartan article mentions a recent study by the Center for Academic Integrity at Duke University, which has found that MBA students are the biggest cheats in academia. In the study, 56 percent of MBA students admit to cheating. They are closely followed by engineering students at 54 percent, and science students at 50 percent.
ONE YEAR AGO — Oct. 4, 2010
Alpha Chi Omega hosts a giant game of “Ultimate Ninja” as a fundraiser for the Pittsburgh Women’s Shelter, in honor of Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Ninjas Against Domestic Violence had about 30 participants and raised over $1,000.

William S. Dietrich II, the former steel executive who recently donated $265 million to Carnegie Mellon, died late last night, according to the John A. Freyvogel Inc. funeral home. The cause of death was attributed to complications from his cancer. He was 73 years old.
Born in Pittsburgh, Dietrich made his fortune by transforming his father's small steel warehouse and distribution business, Dietrich Industries, into the nation's largest manufacturer of light metal framing for the construction industry. When Dietrich Industries was sold to Worthington Industries, Inc., in 1996, Dietrich remained a director until 2008.
Dietrich was an active member of the Pittsburgh community and served on the trustee boards for a variety of local institutions, including Carnegie Mellon, the Carnegie Museum of Art, the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, the UPMC Health System, and the University of Pittsburgh.
On Sept. 7, Dietrich announced that he would be making a $265 million donation to Carnegie Mellon in the form of a charitable remainder trust. “This university puts Pittsburgh on anybody’s world map of great research cities,” Dietrich said at the celebration of his donation in September. “Brilliant people come here as students and faculty, and their presence in our community adds something extraordinary.”
Near the end of September, Dietrich also donated $125 million to the University of Pittsburgh, the single largest gift in that school's history.

Throughout the past week, Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, and staff commemorated Gandhi Jayanti, a national Indian holiday that signifies the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, who was considered to be India’s leader during its independence movement through his promotion of non-violent means of protest.
Multicultural student organizations OM and Mayur-SASA presented a series of events with themes rooted in awareness, service, and reflection to honor Gandhi’s legacy. These events culminated in a “Mahatma Gandhi Birthday Celebration” in the University of Pittsburgh’s Frick Fine Arts Auditorium last Sunday. The celebration was sponsored by the Alliance for Humanitarian Initiatives, Nonviolence, and Spiritual Advancement (AHINSA), Carnegie Mellon, and other various organizations. Sunday’s event included interfaith presentations, cultural performances, and a lecture titled “Gandhi’s Legacy of ‘Satyagraha’ in the Modern World” by Uma Majmundar, a published author and Gandhian researcher. Performances consisted of a patriotic Indian song sung by students Alimpon Sinha, a first-year computer science major, and Neel Nadkarni, a sophomore business administration major.
M. Shernell Smith, coordinator of student development, also spoke at the celebration. She noted that “the practices and principles of Gandhi had an impact on other movements, such as the direct influence that he had on Martin Luther King Jr. and the American civil rights movement.” Smith called the series of Gandhi Jayanti events, which she helped to plan, “vital to the vibrancy of our campus community in regard to cultural awareness.” She also said that the point of these events is “about empowering our students to engage as well. It is about meaningful dialogue and engagement.”
In addition to the lecture by Majmundar, OM hosted a tree planting service initiative, “Planting the Seeds of Non-Violence,” in Frick Park. About 20 OM members participated, and, in conjunction with Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy members, they planted about 50 trees.
“The purpose of this service initiative was to support the positive values that Gandhi stood for, including peace and non-violence,” said Vishalsai Daswani, the vice president of OM and a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major.
Trisha Ambe, a sophomore materials science and biomedical engineering double major, is a part of hOMies, OM’s planning committee, and participated in the tree planting initiative. “It was cold and rainy but still a rewarding experience and good bonding activity,” Ambe said.
Ambe, who considers Mahatma Gandhi to be her personal role model and hero, also pointed out, “This service event and the other events for Gandhi Jayanti successfully made students aware of Gandhi’s teachings, which is why it is important to continue to celebrate his life.”
Other events held throughout the week included passing out slices of a “Happy Birthday Gandhi” cake and “Be the Change” wristbands, as well as selling Gandhi T-shirts. CulinArt also stepped in to celebrate, adding “Gandhi specials” on menus throughout campus dining locations.
Archit Kumar, a junior information systems and social and decision sciences double major and OM president, noted the importance of commemorating Gandhi. “His message is so strong and powerful that we must take moments of our day to celebrate with the CMU community the power of non-violence and perseverance,” he said.
The Gandhi Jayanti events seemed to have an effect on students. Senior economics and Chinese double major Crystal Wray saw the “Be the Change” wristbands and said that it inspired her to try to become a more selfless person. “I want to get more involved with volunteer work,” she said. “Remembering Gandhi and everything he stood for simply empowered me to take more time to think about others.”
OM puts on a variety of other events throughout the year; the next upcoming event is the Diwali Garba on Oct. 14 in St. Nicholas’ Greek Orthodox Church.

A panel of media experts, policymakers, and Pittsburgh residents engaged in a community dialogue last Monday that covered a variety of issues concerning quality of reporting and the state of media in Pittsburgh. Titled “Owning Our Airwaves: A Community Dialogue with Media Policymakers,” the event was held in the University Center’s McConomy Auditorium at 7 p.m.
Panelists discussed reforms that, if implemented, would ensure that Pittsburgh residents have accurate reporting from a diverse array of viewpoints. They also discussed government and corporate accountability in promoting policies that foster these viewpoints. Diversity in viewpoints among women and racial minorities was also of paramount concern to panelists.
The panel featured moderator Matt Wood, policy director of Free Press, a national nonpartisan organization that advocates media reforms. Congressman Mike Doyle (D–Pa.) and Federal Communications Commissioner Michael Copps were distinguished guests on the panel. 
Joining them were other experts: Deborah Acklin, president and CEO of WQED Multimedia; Marge Krueger of Communications Workers of America; Khari Mosley of the Urban Green Growth Collective and Pittsburgh United; Jon Peha, professor at Carnegie Mellon and chief technologist of the Federal Communications Commission; and Chris Ramirez of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists.
The evening began with a listening session as panelists gave their opening remarks. The rest of the event was dedicated to a Q&A session.
The discussion arose in light of the FCC’s 2010 Annual Ownership Review. Beginning in 2002, media ownership reviews have occurred every four years, paying particular attention to media consolidation. Current deliberations center around concerns of cross-ownership arrangements that proponents argue would improve journalism with enhanced resources. Critics argue that such arrangements reduce staff and limit the number of voices in the media marketplace. The newly formed Congressional “super- committee,” pursuant in its obligations to cut the federal budget, will also determine the budget for public media. 
Each panelist started the discussion with individual opening remarks.
Wood initiated a discussion about diversity. “Free Press believes that, to enrich our society, the media must report on and portray diverse ideas or opinions,” he said.
According to Wood, “Ensuring diversity of voices on the air specifically by making broadcast licenses available to women and people of color is not just a nice idea. It’s federal law, which requires the FCC to avoid excessive concentration of licenses and to disseminate licenses among a wide variety of applicants.” 
He argued that the FCC has not fulfilled that mandate. Despite a growth in minority populations, he noted that FCC license figures have stayed flat or have started to drop for these minorities.
The notion of giving certain communities a voice in reporting was a common theme. The panelists argued that a truly free press is dependent upon local involvement and increased democratization.
Doyle advocated empowering local low-power radio stations throughout the U.S. He championed the bipartisan Local Community Radio Act, which encourages the formation of low-power community radio stations in cities, towns, and suburbs across the country. “Finally, anyone with the passion and drive will be able to apply for a license to run a radio station,” Doyle said.
Copps also endorsed the notion of “a media that fosters localism, diversity, and competition.” Drawing from his own experience, Copps explained how the FCC under Commissioner Michael Powell “wanted to make major changes to the media ownership rules to help a few big special interests buy up more and more independent local outlets.” 
Copps combated Powell’s efforts through town-hall meetings held by members of Congress and citizen groups. “Three million people wrote to Congress and the FCC saying ‘no’ to Chairman Powell’s rules — thumbs down,” he said. He added that Congress overturned Powell’s rules, and the Third Circuit Court in Pennsylvania deemed the laws deficient. Copps, lauding these efforts by ordinary citizens, declared, “A movement was born.”
Throughout the proceedings, panel members discussed their concerns about an increase in media consolidation and a decrease in diversity. These two threads permeated the discussion about freedom of the press, which Mosley declared as “the hallmark of our democracy.”

The Carnegie Mellon administration held a town meeting last Monday to update the campus and Pittsburgh communities on the progress of its 10-year master plan. 
As required by the Pittsburgh city code, the plan outlines the university’s course for development and expansion for the next decade and beyond. The plan, which was first made public in March, could lead to new academic buildings and significant alterations to Forbes Avenue.
Monday’s presentation was held in Rangos Ballroom in the University Center, and it drew around 100 people from campus and the greater Pittsburgh area. Bob Reppe, director of Campus Design and Facilities Development, stated that continuing the growth of campus and increasing connectivity were some of the main goals.
The plan details several projects that include the development and expansion of the campus along Craig Street and in the Morewood parking lot. The university has identified the Morewood lot as a possible location for a new academic quad, which would include a new Tepper School of Business building.
One project that is in the works right now is a 75,000-square-foot nano-biomedical energy research facility. In his presentation, Reppe called it the “most real” of all the projects proposed.
Students can also expect to see changes to Forbes Avenue in the near future. The plan proposes to reduce vehicular traffic to one lane each way, add bicycle lanes, and reconfigure intersections to make them safer. Some of the concerns that campus leaders have had are the speed of cars traveling down Forbes and the prevalence of jaywalking among students. The hope is that the bicycle paths will provide a buffer between pedestrians and vehicles.
Reppe told The Tartan last year that a main objective is to “embrace Forbes as the main street of campus.” As Carnegie Mellon expands northward, the university aims to break down the aforementioned barriers to student safety.
Ralph Horgan, associate vice provost of Campus Design, said one of the main goals of this master plan is to “increase connectivity among current real estate.” In the future, the university plans to create additional paths to Fifth Avenue, as well as walkways to connect the east and west sides of campus across Panther Hollow.
Travis Rozich, a first-year architecture major, expressed his praise for the plan. “I’m a fan of how we’re expanding.”
“I think it’s been mostly positive,” Horgan said of students’ reaction to the plan.
Many residents who were present, however, were displeased with what they saw as a proposal to reduce traffic lanes in an already congested street. Anne Curtis, a resident on Unger Street, worried that these changes would aggravate traffic problems and ignore the problem of students jaywalking.
Reppe was quick to point out that, at this point, this was just a proposal. The plan will be submitted to city council this week, where it will start the months-long process for approval. A strong characteristic of the plan, Reppe noted, is its flexibility. “We need to be able to adjust so we can accommodate the next big thing that comes over the horizon.”
The plan also includes the addition of a new recreation and fitness area to the University Center, additions to Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall and Hamburg Hall, and renovations to Skibo Gym.
Currently, only the nano-biomedical facility is being planned and worked on. According to Reppe, the implementation of the other projects would be contingent on funding.

Almost 60 study abroad programs and foreign colleges set up tables in the University Center last Tuesday at the annual Study Abroad Fair, allowing students to explore options of going abroad for a semester.
The fair is one of several informational events that the Office of International Education (OIE) holds each year to introduce students to study abroad programs, according to Jaycie Galbraith, the coordinator of study abroad and international programming.
“Coming here is a good and easy way to get some resources quick and sift through them later,” said Alex Kozhemiakov, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering.
Some students found the fair overwhelming. H&SS first-year Imaobong Essien said that there was so much information that she didn’t know when she would be able to read all of it. Emily Khaykin, a first-year in H&SS, felt the same. “It’s been very overwhelming. There are so many tables with so many different resources available to me as a student,” she said. “Luckily I can go back to my dorm and unload my bag to look at all my materials, narrow down the ones that interest me, and come back next year when I’m definitely ready.”
Some, like Khaykin, attended the fair with the intent of exploring their options and simply seeing what programs were made available through Carnegie Mellon. Other students, who already knew they would want to study abroad, went with specific plans in mind.
Katherine Basore, a sophomore chemistry major, said she specifically searched for summer abroad programs in Greece. “I’m surprised how many people actually have a summer program in Greece,” she said. She was worried, however, that the programs would not have courses related to her major.
Many students find studying abroad a worthwhile experience. John Mailley, a senior photography and graphic and communication design double major, is currently attending Carnegie Mellon as an exchange student from New Zealand; he said that studying abroad should be mandatory. “A lot of [what I learned] is people skills and independence,” he said. “Traveling by yourself is one thing, and getting here and making friends in a totally new environment, not knowing anyone, is really good to building your character.” 
Christine Menand, a coordinator of study abroad programs, agreed. “I think a lot of it is the independence, creativity, and ability to network and handle yourself in a variety of manners,” she said. “I think students have the opportunity to grow so much professionally and personally.”
According to Menand and Galbraith, an increasing number of students are going abroad, and the fair has attracted more programs every year.

Dietrich gives $125 million to University of Pittsburgh
William S. Dietrich, the philanthropist and oil entrepreneur who recently gifted Carnegie Mellon $265 million, has donated a $125 million fund to the University of Pittsburgh. 
Dietrich holds a Ph.D. from Pitt, and is a member of the university’s Board of Trustees. According to Bloomberg, the fund, like the one that Dietrich gave to Carnegie Mellon, will become active upon Dietrich’s death. 
A resolution will be introduced to rename Pitt’s School of Arts and Sciences the Kenneth P. Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences, after Dietrich’s father, just as Carnegie Mellon’s College of Humanities and Social Sciences has been renamed after Dietrich’s mother, Marianna Brown Dietrich.
In a statement, Dietrich said, “As a graduate who personally benefitted from my own studies at Pitt, I want to ensure that the university can continue to provide educational opportunities of the highest quality to its undergraduate and graduate students.”
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports that Dietrich’s donation is more than double the amount of any of Pitt’s previous one-time donations.
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also reports that it is the 10th-largest private gift ever given to a public university in the United States.
Student government surveys on-campus wireless signal
Carnegie Mellon’s student government has created a survey to identify wireless connectivity problem areas on campus. The results of the survey will be made available to Computing Services, in the hopes that Carnegie Mellon’s wireless network will be improved.
Jason Imbrogno, the president of the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA), said that student government is particularly concerned because of the recent $300 increase in Carnegie Mellon’s technology fee, nearly double what it had been in recent years. According to an email sent out by the GSA, Carnegie Mellon received $2.4 million from the tech fee this year.
“Last year after the tech fee got raised, Michael Murphy came to an undergrad Senate meeting,” Imbrogno said, “and I asked him point-blank, ‘Will the internet work on campus next year?’ and he said yes.” But Imbrogno said that the survey results, which total at least 185 so far, indicate that the internet is not working to students’ satisfaction.
Imbrogno has already met with representatives from Computing Services, whom he said were not aware that so many students were having issues with the campus wireless network. 
He urged any students who experience trouble with the internet on campus to fill out the survey at bit.ly/cmuwireless, or to contact Computing Services via email at advisor@andrew.

Founded in 1997 as a DVD-by-mail service, Netflix quickly expanded into the market of streaming video and developed a large customer base. However, in recent weeks, Netflix has become the subject of controversy after the company announced price changes and internal restructures aimed to discourage use of its DVD service. With customers facing a dilemma, here are some statistics on Netflix:
24.6 million: Netflix subscribers as of June 2011
22.2%: percent of all U.S. broadband traffic consisting of Netflix streaming
19%: the price percent shares in Netflix dropped after the announcements of restructuring and rate increases
60%: percent of price increases for Netflix subscribers who use both DVD and streaming services

Let’s talk about “hooking up.” A study published in Health Communication shows that it’s a great term. They didn’t phrase it that way, of course. In fact, they were a little concerned that if people talk too much about hooking up, the next minute they’d have an STI. Hooking up “truly is a risky behavior,” they say. But they do point out that the way we talk about hooking up shows that we use people in our social network to coordinate our ideas about sexual norms.
First thing’s first: do you know what “hooking up” is? 94 percent of people in the study did. CS majors comprise about 6 percent of Carnegie Mellon’s population, right? 
Let me put it this way. Imagine if your “object” was “oriented” to hers, and one night you got drunk and hacked into her “mainframe.” Or just made out — people have different definitions. In fact, the ambiguity of “hooking up” is what makes the phrase a great linguistic achievement. Girls can use it and not feel like sluts to their friends, because it might just mean fooling around. Guys can use it and feel like a sex panther, even if last night was less of a carousal and more of a snuggle. As they say in Anchorman, “60 percent of the time it works every time.”
More awesome reasons to use the phrase “hooking up,” you ask? It allows us to talk about sex with people we know. Let’s face it, if this column was strewn with “vaginal intercourse” (the phrase, not the — what a picture), I would hardly be able to read it. My editor wouldn’t even let me use the word “lame-ass” in last week’s column; how would she ever let me talk about sex? Well, “hooking up” is the catch-all that lets us navigate shifting sexual mores together.
Health Communication’s study found that some people even talk with their family about hooking up. Personally, I think that’s weird, but it does show a trend. Going back 150 years to the Victorian era, it was inappropriate to even say the word “leg” in mixed company. In that cultural context, people would end up doing all kinds of things they couldn’t talk about. That’s not to say that one needs language to be happy with one’s behavior, merely that if we can’t talk about something, it’s difficult to change.
So it’s great that we can have words with which to talk about sex. “Hooking up” allows us to determine our impression of sexual activity less on intuition and inexperience and more on the discourse of our community. Yay for communication!
But before we give ourselves a pat on the back for our ability to communicate with each other, it’s worth pointing out the limitations of how we use “hooking up.” The study analyzed hook-up talk between college students and their “friends from university,” “friends from outside university,” and “family.” That seems like a pretty clean way to do it, except that it leaves out the person you’re hooking up with. Having never actually hooked up myself, I’m not much of an authority, but it seems to me that people who hook up don’t actually talk about it with each other.
In fact, I would say that half of the noncommital aspect of “hooking up” is an inability to talk about the act with the other person. It’ll create drama, it’ll make things awkward, and we both already understand that it doesn’t mean anything. That’s short-sighted, and it encourages an intimacy of invulnerability, in which you don’t give anything of yourself so you don’t get hurt.
Don’t get me wrong. This study says that when it comes to sex, people listen to the people they know. Disembodied columns in the school newspaper don’t exactly top my list of friends, either, so I understand that my perspective might not do much. But I believe we should continue improving our ability to talk about sex, and part of that is admitting to the areas where we’re deficient. 
“Hooking up,” as it reflects an attitude in which the other person is mere flesh instead of a human being, is one such area.

The new Institutional Master Plan 2012 is a great example of how the administration can effectively communicate with the campus community and the community at large. Planned over 18 months, the master plan details the way the university wants to expand over the next 10 years. With over 80 public meetings on different parts of the plan that included campus and community input, the university has made the master plan and the decisions leading up to it quite transparent. Granted, the university is required to submit a master plan to the city every 10 years, but it is wise that the university recognizes that the input of the community is paramount to passing such a plan.
We believe that the administration should prioritize the building of certain structures and amenities included in the plan. Housing should be one of the topmost priorities of the master plan implementation. With an increase in students over the past several years, more housing is a must. We are also a bit worried about the proposed buildings on the Morewood parking lot. This area is the long-time home of Spring Carnival, a Carnegie Mellon tradition that alumni, students, faculty, staff, and the Oakland community all enjoy. We hope the administration has thought about a suitable place where Carnival could be moved and made provisions to keep one of Carnegie Mellon’s most important events intact.
Even more important are the proposed alterations to Forbes Avenue, which include converting the road from four lanes into two with added bike lanes. Although Oakland is known for its high density of bikers, we wonder if this change might impede traffic, buses, and emergency vehicles. This sentiment was echoed by community members at several of the public master plan meetings, where the administration fielded questions and listened to local opinions on the plan. Of course, not all of the initiatives described in the master plan will come to fruition, but if it is as successful as the last master plan, the community and students should be well aware of the proposed changes.
The administration should be congratulated for a well-thought-out, transparent piece of documentation that lets the Carnegie Mellon community know what direction the university is headed in. We hope that this master plan is a sign that the university continues this trend of good communication well into the future.

I write in reaction to the Sept. 26 Tartan editorial entitled “Dietrich Pride Day indicates deeper H&SS problems.” I found myself both bemused and bothered by this piece.
First, the suggestion that criticisms of the recent Dietrich Pride Day — not enough food, fewer giveaways, imperfect venue — signal “deeper problems” in the college reflects a leap of logic that is, frankly, silly. But no matter, as this was simply the chosen segue to the editorial’s main criticisms of the college:
Then, interestingly, at the bottom of column two, the editorial offers very positive comments about the college, and then seems to complain that the university fails to give it its due in terms of attention and funding so that it can “build an identity.”
Then back to the negative: Rather than make efforts to address the deeper problems (lack of identity; “no singular academic goal, no ‘anchor’ by which to unify its students”; no “singular, branded identity”), the college administration has “again and again chosen to apply only topical remedies, of which Dietrich Pride Day is one such case.” It concludes: “Before students can be proud to be part of a unified H&SS, they need something to be proud of.”
My reactions, in reverse order:
The university’s undergraduate admissions office reports that the number of students applying for admission to Carnegie Mellon and Dietrich College who name this as their “first choice” college within Carnegie Mellon is as high as it’s ever been, and is by far the rule rather than the exception for the students who the college enrolls. And while I cannot cite definitively reliable data regarding where in their hierarchy of college choices Carnegie Mellon and Dietrich College fell for our students, my sense from many encounters with prospective students and their parents in recent years is that the college can hardly be characterized as the “'last choice’ college for many of its students” as the editorial so casually claims.
Then there is the claim that the college “faces the ... problem of being a liberal arts college in the midst of a university where liberal arts degrees are not taken as seriously.” I’m left to wonder what definition of “liberal arts” the editors are using here. Merriam-Webster defines liberal arts as: “(C)ollege or university studies ... intended to provide chiefly general knowledge and to develop general intellectual capacities (as reason and judgment) as opposed to professional or vocational skills.” If this was the intended characterization, it is far off the mark. The college has long been recognized nationally as a cutting-edge example of how “liberal” and “professional” education are not antithetical, but complementary, in the ways that it has shaped its programs within the college, and in partnership with other units of the university. And how ironic that the rest of the university, by implication, is characterized as purely vocational and disdainful of the liberal arts when Carnegie Tech was in fact the birthplace of the “Carnegie Plan” for professional education, which extolled the virtues of professional training complemented by the liberal arts that would not only train one for a profession, but that would also educate one for engaged and responsible citizenship.
Finally, there is the observation that the college has a “great range of diversity” in its departments and programs, but that this results in a lamentable “lack of focus,” and an inability to define itself “in unifying terms” or build a “singular, branded identity.” Here I agree with the editors’ observations about the college’s intellectual and artistic diversity, but I come to radically different conclusions about its significance. Dietrich College is a very diverse college in terms of departments and major programs, and proud of it. In how many colleges — here or anywhere — can you boast of having on the faculty a National Book Award winner, and world-class scholars in cognitive neuroscience, behavioral economics, Bayesian statistics, language learning theory, and social history? This diversity does indeed make it very hard to seize on any single image, label, or brand, but is this a liability as the editorial implies? I think not. Rather, it is our strength and distinction, and not a weakness at all.
Moreover, Dietrich College faculty and students in these diverse areas collaborate in ways that continue to amaze me, linking seemingly disparate disciplines in ways that reflect what a colleague of mine in social and decision sciences calls the true, if elusive, “unity of knowledge.”
So rest assured, Dietrich College students: You have made a “great choice” of college, in ways that you may have only begun to discover and appreciate.

Many of you probably know that the Carnegie Mellon sororities hosted their annual Formal Membership Recruitment (FMR) this past week. Would you like to know how I knew it was FMR week? Through Facebook, of course! — through multiple excited wall posts and exclamatory status updates incessantly streaming through my news feed.
Throughout the week (especially on bid night), my Facebook would update every two seconds with a new post about how great FMR was and how much my friends and acquaintances “<3” their new sororities or members. Quite frankly, it was a bit much. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not blaming the sororities for this attack; I’m blaming the new Facebook.
Yes, Mark Zuckerberg and company initiated some minor facade changes to their website once again. They introduced a sidebar that streams live updates, a top story feature, and a subscribe feature. It seems that the company is trying to encapsulate features from every popular social media and networking site and squish them into Facebook. You could credit the live-stream sidebar to Twitter and the subscription feature that allows you to choose what you share to Google+.
As of now, Facebook’s new layout and features are just messy. The main news feed does not update or refresh as quickly anymore; focus seems to have shifted to the smaller version that follows you as you scroll up and down the page. These recent additions are just annoying. Updates and posts now show up in multiple locations on the screen, allowing for overwhelming spam attacks like the one I experienced. I can no longer simply scroll through my news feed at my own leisurely pace; these features make that nearly impossible.
Not surprisingly, this was not what Facebook executives intended to do with the new changes.
“Now, news feed will act more like your own personal newspaper. You won’t have to worry about missing important stuff, said Mark Tonkelowitz, Facebook’s engineering manager, in a Huffington Post article. “All your news will be in a single stream with the most interesting stories featured at the top. If you haven’t visited Facebook for a while, the first things you’ll see are top photos and statuses posted while you’ve been away. They’re marked with an easy-to-spot blue corner.... If you check Facebook more frequently, you’ll see the most recent stories first.”
Obviously Tonkelowitz and the other Facebook employees are trying to make their website the No. 1 social media site, and consider many new and similar sites serious competition. However, despite the number of social networking sites popping  up on the internet scene, Facebook set the standard by which all other sites are measured. Throwing so many features, applications, special additions, and games onto the site will not make it any more competitive or any more appealing for that matter. To be honest, Facebook doesn’t need all that fluff.
People first swarmed to Facebook to connect with people across the world; they did not sign up to play Farmville or take quizzes about which Disney princess they are. The company should keep that in mind the next time it tries to introduce more changes.

How can a handful of young adults fix the city of Pittsburgh?
This question could be answered by the mayor’s Propel Pittsburgh Commission, a group “dedicated to meeting the concerns and needs of the City of Pittsburgh’s young adults and young professionals.” Formed in 2007, the commission has been described as unwieldy, and many claim it has not lived up to its potential. After being inactive for 10 months due to lack of rehiring after the members of the previous commission fulfilled their terms, the group has been downsized from 35 to 13 members, leaving us to wonder how effective the new commission will be.
There are most definitely issues that a group like this, if used properly, could address. The group could work to improve voter turnout in the 18­–30 demographic. It could focus on transportation issues that plague the city: Port Authority’s unreliability, the lack of taxis, transportation difficulties between core neighborhoods such as the South Side, Lawrenceville, and Friendship. It could focus on a lack of communication between the city and its youth, possibly preventing issues like the 2009 tuition tax proposal.
It is currently unclear if the people who will serve on this commission are the best for the job. The mayor has not announced if any college students from universities like Carnegie Mellon, Pitt, or Dusquene will be selected to serve on the commission. It is also unclear who the mayor is targeting with this commission: young adults who have already decided to stay and live in Pittsburgh, or the majority of students who are counting the weeks until they can graduate and leave the city? We hope that the members of the commission work to survey those who are leaving and have left the city to better understand what others are looking for.
While we call the effectiveness of this commission into question, we recommend that its members focus on economically feasible, short-term solutions to the city’s issues (two to five year plans). In this way they can deliver tangible results that prove they are of use to the city.
Their main responsibility in the coming years should be to prove to their peers, and the city, that they are valuable and effective.

The most recent Wall Street protests, or “occupation,” has received a lot of media attention.
Members of this occupation, dubbed the “Occupy Wall Street” campaign, have been met with alarmingly hostile reception from the New York Police Department and local authorities assigned to the area. Protesters refer to themselves as “the 99 percent” because they claim to represent the majority of the population being taken advantage of by the 1 percent that make up the wealthy population. The protesters began occupying Wall Street on Sept. 17 to protest the way the U.S. political and financial matters were being managed and were met by unfriendly resistance despite the campaign’s dedication to peaceful protesting.
We feel that the protesters had every right to speak their minds, as provided for in our Constitution, and should not have been treated this way by the NYPD.
News of the police’s unexpectedly violent reaction toward protestors first broke when several sources, including ABC News and The Guardian, reported that an officer, Deputy Inspector Anthony V. Bologna of the NYPD, was caught on film macing peaceful protestors and making several aggressive arrests. Throughout this past week, there have been several reported incidents of police abuse toward peaceful protesters. The most recent incident occurred on Oct. 1 when the protesters marched on the Brooklyn Bridge, where over 80 people were arrested and several videos were taken of seemingly non-threatening protestors being blindsided, punched, kicked, beaten with batons, and eventually arrested.
The level of NYPD police brutality against people exercising their First Amendment rights is a concern — to see protesters on film being beaten and dragged, and to see those with video cameras being targeted by the police, suggests that authorities were well aware of their unethical conduct. The police should not protect only a handful of people, but also the larger majority.

Imagine the United States as we know it now, but with a flat income tax rate. If you make $1 a year or $1 million a year, you get taxed the same proportional amount. The U.S. doesn’t currently utilize this system, but instead taxes you more as you make more money. Many people argue that a flat tax rate would allow the super-wealthy to hoard their money instead of the government putting it to better use for social good. I believe that this is not the eventuality of a flat tax rate, and that, given complete control over their money, the wealthy will use it for social good and have a selfish interest in doing so.
There exists an exceptionally large income disparity in the United States, which would be augmented with a flat income tax rate. This means that the wealthy would be exceptionally wealthier than their counterparts on the other end of the spectrum. This is the natural result of the difference in talent that exists in any society. Yet even with a natural income disparity that the government doesn’t diminish with the income tax rate, I believe that the wealthy will take it upon themselves to work for social good.
Should there be an income gap between the wealthy minority and the poor majority, action will be taken to promote social equality, especially if exploitation is taking place, which tends to happen in this societal model. If a revolution occurs, the majority will most likely win, and even if they don’t, the wealthy have to spend egregious amounts of money to come out with a remotely desirable outcome. Obviously this outcome is not good for the wealthy, and so the wealthy will take steps to prevent it. Such steps will include philanthropy and charitable giving to causes that the less wealthy majority deems meaningful and will perpetuate a livable society.
If the wealthy start to stray from a philanthropic social norm, the media will play an important role in continuing charitable giving. For example, in the late 1990s Bill Gates had hardly used any of his vast fortune to work social good. Then several articles, from respected newspapers like the New York Times and the Kansas City Star, came out highlighting his extreme wealth and his lack of giving, which prompted him to create the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Yet this argument is also assuming that the wealthy, and people in general, are inherently selfish and only care about what’s in their best interest. I don’t believe that this is the case, and I believe that especially with a 24-hour news cycle constantly making people aware of the incredible injustices that exist in the world, people will donate to promote global social equity.
Many ask why the wealthy don’t already do this. Many do, but many wealthy people are disincentivized from giving because they feel that the government already takes money from them for the purpose of promoting social equity. Someone who makes $500,000 a year loses about 60-70 percent of his or her income each year to federal, state, and local taxes. This is the equivalent of working from January until September for the government. Many in that position resent the governmental imposition of taxes on their income and therefore take what’s left for themselves.
With a flat income tax rate, the wealthy have both a selfish and selfless interest in charitable giving and will donate to causes that they see fit and, in doing so, close the income gap on their own.

There is one thing that always seems to plague students here at Carnegie Mellon when they attempt to enter a building — getting stuck in a revolving door. Though these doors can be annoying and hazardous, many times it is humorous watching others struggle in and out of buildings.
Perhaps it is the immature part of me that likes the entertainment these doors provide. Witnessing someone getting their backpack or clothes stuck is pretty funny. Then there are always those people who insist on rushing through them, pushing the door with great force and causing any people following them to either do the same or wait until the door slows down. These situations can be either really amusing or really annoying depending on whether or not you are the person waiting to enter the door and what mood you happen to be in. However, if I am having a bad day I don’t need a revolving door to cause unnecessary chaos in my life.
I found that being on the receiving end of a revolving door mishap is not something to laugh about. One annoying aspect of these doors is that you cannot merely walk through them. You must time your entrance to avoid getting smacked in the face or caught in the door. If you have a heavy backpack, you probably want to avoid these doors altogether and save yourself from letting them clamp onto your backpack, jerking you to an embarrassing halt. Then of course, there is the surprising “after-smack” of the door hitting the back of your book bag, causing a shock and possibly causing you to stumble a bit.
I absolutely loathe the revolving door “conveniently” located immediately in front of a few entrance steps at Margaret Morrison. Not only is this door annoying, but it has the potential to cause accidents. Entering through this door is not nearly as dangerous as exiting through it. Each time I pass through, I imagine what would happen if I were wearing a large backpack, and the thought scares me. Imagining what would happen on a rainy or snowy day is even scarier.
These revolving doors are not a huge problem because there are only a few of them, but they are not really necessary. I appreciate the fact that, if I am not in the mood to tussle with them, there are always alternative entrances nearby; on a day when I am in a hurry, I do not want to be smacked, shoved, or rushed through a revolving door. I don’t want to maneuver through an obstacle course; I just want to get to where I am going on time and without any injuries.

In the words of the great and wise Ms. Frizzle, it is time for you to “take chances! Make mistakes! Get messy!”
Though you’d love to stay curled up warm in your bed, life stills goes on. The weather will not be getting better anytime soon, so bundle up and brave the cold.
When discussing stupid decisions one of your friends made with another friend, try to do so where others can’t hear it. I really don’t need to know when your friend’s court date is.
Cast your fears aside and do something that puts you out of your comfort zone. It won’t help to make you a more well rounded person, but it will be a change of pace to your boring week.
You talk a big game, but inside you are just crying out for attention. Keep at it and you will finally annoy someone into paying attention to you. But will it make you happy?
No matter how bad you want to win $1 million or a brand new sports car, there is no excuse for beating up a little kid and taking his McDonald’s Monopoly game board.
Remember, glitter makes everything better. 
The only way you will survive this week is through sheer willpower and determination. Game on.
Whatever you do, don’t ever insult another person’s favorite Doctor.
As much as you don’t want to admit it, the thing you fear might actually be true. Don’t beat yourself up over this, because you’re human, and flaws are just something you have to deal with.
It’s cold outside, so time to grab a warm blanket, lots of popcorn, a few close friends, and settle on the couch for long and enjoyable nerd TV marathons.
Last week was a doozy to say the least, but this week will be so much better. Look for a happy, unexpected surprise on Thursday.
