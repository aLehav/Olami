The 2019 IAAF World Athletics Championships was held last week in Doha, Qatar, and saw an array of amazing displays of athleticism. There were first-time gold medalists, championship records, and world records, but perhaps the most impactful and memorable moment of the entire competition came on the very first day during the 5000 meter run.
The first heat of the men’s 5000 meters got off to a fast start, with Julien Wanders of Switzerland leading after the first thousand meters with a split of 2:48.83. The next lap saw Oscar Chelimo of Uganda move to the forefront of the pack, splitting 5:36.22 at the 2000 meter mark.
The pre-race favorites began to get move ahead within the group, with the likes of Ethiopians Selemon Barega and Muktar Edris, along with Kenyan Jacob Krop, the latter setting the pace for the next two laps with splits of 8:17.59 and 10:56.52.
A powerful kick in the last 100 meters of the race allowed Selemon Barega to overtake Jacob Krop, qualifying for the final in first place with a time of 13:24.69. Krop, along with Barenga’s fellow countryman Muktar Edris, also qualified, as did Pan American champion Mohammad Ahmed of Canada. (Edris would go on to win the finals of the 5000 meters, with Barenga placing second and Ahmed in third.)
Although the main pack of runners had completed the race, a few athletes who had been left behind by the grueling pace continued to race. Among these were Jonathan Busby of Aruba and Braima Suncar Dabó of Guinea-Bissau. Both were the only athlete representing his country at the Championships.
With most of the remaining runners finishing sporadically in the minute that followed, Busby and Dabó became the only ones remaining on the track.
Busby was on his last lap, but was clearly exhausted. 300 meters from the finish line, fatigue forced him to slow his pace down to a near-stop. The crowd seemed apprehensive, and for an anxious moment, it appeared as if Busby was not going to be able to finish the race. However, fervent cheering broke out as Braima Suncar Dabó came to his opponent’s aid.
Grasping Busby’s arm, Dabó led him through 150 meters before taking Busby’s arm and draping it around his neck, further supporting him to finish the last 150 meters of the race. As the crowd rose to their feet in approval and applause, the two athletes crossed the finish line side-by-side. Although it had been nearly five minutes since the main pack of athletes had finished, the spectators showed the same ovation it had given to the victor, if not greater.
Though neither spoke the other’s language, Busby made his thanks obvious, and Dabó continued to monitor Busby’s condition until the designated medical personnel took over. When later interviewed by Reuters about his determination to help his fellow competitor, Dabó stated that, “My thoughts were to help him finish, that is the point of the race.”
Although he had run the distance faster in the past, the International Association of Athletics Federations recorded Dabó’s final time in the men’s 5000 meter run as a personal best, perhaps in a show of solidarity.
In an increasingly more competitive sporting environment that often approaches the degree of cutthroat, it is frankly refreshing and inspiring to witness such a display of sportsmanship — to see an athlete helping their competitor on such a grand stage for no other reason than deciding that it was the right thing to do. It is this kind of action that encourages other athletes to follow suit, taking more care in and paying more detailed attention to the way in which they treat their opponents.
Braima Suncar Dabó may not have won any accolades in the form of medals, but his demonstration of compassion and championship spirit has undoubtedly won him the respect and reverence of the global sporting community.

The second matchday of the European Champions League group stage saw several notable matches. Among these was the game between English side Tottenham Hotspur, the runner-ups from the previous season, and German giants Bayern Munich.
Although Tottenham had done well in the 2018-19 Champions League season, the 2019-20 season was not going smoothly, with Spurs botching a 2-goal lead to tie Olympiakos on the first matchday. In contrast, Bayern had won their game that day, and were sitting at the top of the Bundesliga table. Nevertheless, the field was open for either team to snatch up all 3 points.
Having beaten Bayern in the summer Audi Cup on penalties, Tottenham hoped to replicate the quality of that performance against the clearly better side. And since the game was being played in North London, it was expected that the pitch and the crowd would grant Spurs a significant home field advantage. 
Kickoff began with both teams looking eager to score. Bayern’s first shot on target came in the 2nd minute of the game, with Kingsley Coman picking out Serge Gnabry’s run forward, necessitating a solid save from Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris. Tottenham continued to press deep, with shots from Heung-min Son in the 6th and 10th minutes, forcing saves from Manuel Neuer. Another chance for Bayern early in the game fell to Robert Lewandowski, but the effort failed to trouble Lloris.
After a bad mistake from Bayern defender Corentin Tolisso just outside the Bayern box, the ball found its way to Moussa Sissoko, whose well-timed pass to Son saw a precise finish that allowed Tottenham to take an early lead in the 12th minute. The 1-0 scoreline wouldn’t last for long, though, as an incomplete clearance by Tottenham’s Jan Vertonghen fell to Joshua Kimmich, who curled his shot into the back of the net from 20 yards out, leveling the score.
However, Spurs continued to press forward. An effort from Harry Kane in the 18th minute caught Neuer in no-man’s-land, but was cleared by David Alaba. More shots came from Serge Aurier, Son, and Kane, but were all either just wide or saved by Neuer. In the 45th minute, a scramble in the Tottenham box ended with the ball falling to an unmarked Lewandowski, who whipped the ball just past the reach of Lloris to give Bayern a 1-2 lead heading into half-time.
The second half seemed to start well for Tottenham, with an effort from Dele Ali in the 50th minute testing Neuer. However, Bayern fought back. A fantastic 40-yard run by Gnabry in the 53rd minute topped with an equally impressive finish saw the visitors double their lead. Scarcely two minutes later, a mistake by Harry Winks let Tolisso feed the ball to an ever-ready Gnabry, whose well-aimed shot found the back of the net off the post, bringing the scoreline to 4-1 in favor of Bayern.
A clash in the 59th minute between Danny Rose and Kingsley Coman just inside the 18-yard box was ruled a high boot on the part of Coman, and a coolly taken penalty by Kane seemed to give the hosts a chance at a comeback. However, Bayern continued to hold fast, preventing Spurs from posing a serious threat to their goal.
The final ten minutes of the game saw a Bayern onslaught. It began with a 40-yard pass by Thiago in the 83rd minute that allowed Serge Gnabry to run behind the Tottenham line of defense, completing his hat-trick. Then, in the 87th minute, Alderweireld’s pass was intercepted by Thiago, and Lewandowski slipped behind his marker to score a brace. 
It didn’t stop there, though, and a mistake by Aurier in the 88th minute meant that it took barely another minute for Gnabry to find the back of the net a fourth time, making the final scoreline an astonishing 7 goals for the visitors versus 2 for the hosts.
This loss means that Tottenham Hotspur are now bottom of the Group B table, with only one win in their last 5 games. The severity of this defeat also raises questions regarding manager Mauricio Pochettino’s tenure at the club, along with the status of the team as a whole.
A triumphant Bayern Munich now tops the Group B table, looking poised to take a spot in the Round of 16, and from Serge Gnabry’s remarkable performance, it seems certain that the future of the club is in good hands.

This is Penalty Shouts, The Tartan’s sports column inspired by the The New Yorker’s column Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled column will focus on anything and everything funny in the sports world that is deserving of our comedic attention.
After California governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill granting NCAA players rights to their likeness into law, the NCAA board room went into lockdown. Their office inside the peak of Mt. St. Helens had sirens blaring as windows and doors were sealed by blast proof metal. Fortunately, I was able to take the SLICE van, equipped with ten million horsepower and a light machine gun, to Washington before the doors sealed for good. But it was a close call as I coolly slid underneath the blast shield, almost losing my trademark hat and whip in the process. The Tartan had exclusive access.
Inside their boardroom, there was a long, oval table with suits seated around the perimeter. The biggest and fattest sat at the head, opposite of the in-wall television screen projecting a PowerPoint slide that read, “OK. The Apocalypse is here. Now what?”
The unfortunate sap presenting on what exactly the NCAA should do next was dropped through a trapdoor after he tried to explain that the NCAA could work with the players and still generate enough revenue to survive if they trimmed administrative fat. Another person, rather reminiscent of a mouse crossed a stick bug, walked in to finish the presentation: “The NCAA can survive. We need to lawyer up, hit the gyms (with taxes), and delete Facebook.” He has a point about Facebook. But the others? Trying to defeat a law that protects 18-23 year olds in court seems like an outright evil thing to do. 
Then again, what organization has a secret headquarters inside of a volcano with blast shields protecting doors and windows and preventing escape? To name a few: Syndrome from The Incredibles, Dr. Evil from Austin Powers, The Grinch, and whoever that villain is in Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams. And now, the NCAA. If you’re associated with a person who has evil in their name, bro wyd?
After listening for a little longer to the suits drone on about generating revenue and revolutionizing the economy, I decided I had enough. The only way out was through a giant hole in the middle of the volcano, so I parachuted down for what felt like forever, feeling vaguely like Juni Cortez in Spy Kids 2, until I hit bottom. I walked out the front door.
As I walked away, the NCAA’s secret lair blew up behind me. The Arctic Monkeys's “Do I Wanna Know?” played me out, so I slid on my aviators without looking back. The job was done.

Governor Gavin Newsom of California has passed what may probably go down as the most substantive piece of legislation in sports history, since the courts ruled on the side of Oscar Roberston when he sued the NBA in 1970. That case, which allowed for larger contracts via free agency’s implementation in the NBA, completely transformed the league, sending it into a new era. 
Similarly, the NCAA has now approached its own fork in the road, where any decision the organization makes will change its future course. The NCAA is at a turning point, but importantly, so too are the athletes. Whatever comes in the next few years as a result of this decision will be a reflection of how we value college athletics.
For the NCAA, this legislation could possibly not come at a worse time, with a recession looming and a movement behind the students. California is one of the few states that they cannot afford to lose, as the universities in the UCal and Cal State system, plus private institutions like Stanford and USC, are responsible for millions of dollars in revenue for the NCAA. With bills nearly identical to California’s being brought up in states like New York and Florida, the NCAA must reckon with the risk of the revenue loss escalating out of control. The NCAA has been given four years by California to either synthesize or antagonize California’s policies within their own policies, but if other states join California, then it is doubtful that they will have that much time. The NCAA must adapt to develop new revenue streams. 
Meanwhile, for the athletes, they now enter a world in which there is, for some of them, infinite possibility. A five-star recruit going to UCLA will be able to leverage their talent, if they play football or basketball, to make what could amount to millions of dollars before they even enter a professional league. This would be great for them, but for other athletes who are either not as well regarded in a major sport, or participants in a sport that does not have national popularity (say, water polo) this will have a more muted effect. For some, they may be able to leverage their talents to set up a profitable YouTube channel, or serve as high school coaches. And for others, nothing may happen. College students are now entering into an unregulated market where they are able to hire agents, but now risk hiring an unscrupulous agent, and may end up indebted and worse off than they were before.
More likely than not, it will be a net gain for the athletes. It will allow them to learn and apply business techniques to their brand, and they may be forced to learn key money management skills that are transferable to any walk of life. The protections provided to the students massively outweigh the revenue lost by the NCAA, but now that the students will be able to monetize their brand, the repercussions on student life will be determined along the way.

Global and U.S. greenhouse gas emissions increased again in 2018. Climate change is far from a won battle. Innovations in energy technology are required to slow the world’s approach to the precipice of climate catastrophe.
On Tuesday, Sept. 17, the Scott Institute for Energy Innovation featured Professor of the Practice and Energy Futures Initiative Principal Joseph Hezir, for a lecture on the novel field of carbon sequestration. Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) is the process of removing CO2 from the atmosphere or oceans and storing it in soil, plant matter, and minerals. 
In its current state, a large CDR effort is the only way for the world to prevent a 2°C average temperature increase. As carbon emission is reduced, and hopefully eliminated, climate change will still only get worse. Dangerous points of no return have already been passed according to climate scientists from around the globe — a paper from 2007 describes the earth’s permafrost as containing about 25-50 percent of the total quantity of soil organic carbon, atmospheric carbon stored in soil.
Some permafrost has been storing the same carbon for millennia, resilient to the natural heat cycles of the earth. As the permafrost is now heated, this carbon, in the form of CO2 or methane, is released into the atmosphere. Thermokarst, or abrupt thaws, are when ground ice melts and deep, old permafrost pockets are exposed, releasing huge amounts of carbon. These irregular surfaces of land reach deep into the ancient permafrost, belching massive amounts of locked CO2 into the atmosphere. The released carbon then heats the earth through the greenhouse gas effect, which further heats the permafrost, creating a positive feedback cycle that will unlock enough carbon for the permafrost to continue melting catastrophically. It is estimated that 200 billion tons of carbon will be released by the thawing of permafrost over the next few centuries — that’s about 15 percent of the total carbon emitted by industrialization.
Other positive feedback systems include desertification, rainforest decay, peat decomposition, and forest fires. Along with our past emissions, these loops will continue to heat the planet even while industrial emissions are reduced and eliminated. A goal of net zero emissions is insufficient to address the issue of past emissions, which have set in motion what is essentially a boulder rolling down a hill, increasing in speed uncontrollably. There is no chance for an unaided return to pre-industrial climate in the next century. Even if we reduced new emissions to zero, the old emitted carbon will linger in the air for another millennium, heating the planet like an oven.
Our only chance seems to be the removal of carbon from the atmosphere, CDR. Our lingering past emissions pose just as existential a threat to civilization as our current emissions. CDR is one of the few existing technological methods for combating past emissions. 
In the lecture, Dr. Hezir introduced a proposal for the creation of a comprehensive three-part, ten-year R&D initiative involving 12 government agencies, with a total funding of $10.7 billion. 
Capture technology includes direct air capture, terrestrial and biological storage, carbon mineralization, and coastal and ocean storage. CO2 disposition involves geological sequestration and CO2 utilization. Cross-cutting is the multidisciplinary side of the initiative, focusing on data collection, research into the economics of carbon, and public opinion. 
The scale of the global CDR program must be 10 gigatons of CO2 per year by 2050 and 20 gigatons of CO2 per year by 2100 in order to reverse the massive amount of anthropogenic emissions. To put these numbers into context, one gigaton of CO2 was emitted by the entire U.S. light-duty vehicle fleet of 250 million vehicles in 2017. To have a significant impact on climate change, the CDR initiative must develop an industry on the scale of the U.S. steel sector.
For such an industry to be effective, the ten-year research initiative must reduce the cost of every type of carbon capture method and lay the groundwork for massive investment.  
In a recently published paper, scientists from the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and from the firm Carbon Engineering detailed engineering and cost analysis for a 1 Mt-CO2/year direct air capture plant. This plant would have a levelized cost of $94 to $232 per ton CO2 from the atmosphere. “This design reflects roughly 100 person-years of development by Carbon Engineering,” stated the paper.  
This bi-circular process is facilitated by four major components, the contactor, the pellet reactor, the calciner, and the slaker. First, the contactor brings ambient air and an alkaline solution together, effectively “trapping” the ambient carbon in potassium carbonate. Next, the pellet reactor adds calcium ions into the carbon saturated solution, causing the precipitation of CaCO3 or calcite. Water is also removed in this step. Then, these calcite pellets are heated, yielding calcium oxide, and the pure CO2 now removed from the air, can be compressed, sequestered, and used in industry. Finally, heat from the slaker is used to dry and preheat the pellets, yielding sufficient steam to further the reaction.
But other carbon capture methods are equally important. The U.S. government’s Advanced Research Projects Agency has been developing a new technology which enhances the roots of wetland plants to store carbon in a more resilient fashion. Wetlands can be expanded into low vegetation lowlands, and reforestation can store carbon in massive amounts. Ocean algae remove massive amounts of carbon from the air but are threatened by ocean acidification. Carbon can be mineralized into solids and stored underground, but today the cost of these methods are too high to be implemented on a significant scale.
Carbon taxes are a surefire way to reduce emissions to required levels. An implementation that allocates the collected funds into research and production of new energy production systems. However, carbon taxes are politically unviable in today's political climate.
Professor Hezir had a message for young engineers, champing at the bit to create impactful innovations. The techniques outlined will decrease the cost of carbon sequestration, he said, but we need real breakthroughs in creating processes which efficiently convert forms of carbon into materials, energy, and production.

The largest human organ is not the lungs or the stomach, but the skin. Protecting our sensitive internal workings from the elements, our skin serves an important purpose as both a barrier and a vehicle for sensory stimulation, without which we would be literal piles of flesh.
Unlike humans, robots can get along without any soft outer covering. Their metallic exteriors protect their sensitive electronics and their sense data, delivered via intricate arrays of sensors and circuits. But just because something works doesn’t mean it can’t be improved. Once again, Carnegie Mellon researchers have advanced the field of robotics by giving robots soft sensing through an outer layer of magnetic skin.
Conventional methods of detecting tactile sensations require a single wire connected to every contact point. "The wires might be fine inside hard cases such as smartphones and other devices, but if you're talking about fabric-skin or something else that's soft — then suddenly all those wires become sources of failure," explained Carmel Majidi, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering, in a university press release.
To solve this problem, Majidi and his colleagues at the Soft Machines Lab developed a silicon rubber skin that relies on magnetic field disturbances inside the skin when it touches another object. These disturbances are detected by a magnetometer, which then relays the information to central processing. The data can be used to infer the location and pressure of contact with the skin.
With this more streamlined method for detection of tactile sensations, the researchers were able to create “soft” robots that are more efficient and less prone to electrical or mechanical failures. This makes it possible for soft robots to more effectively fulfill their roles in sensitive industries, such as healthcare and assisted living for elderly or physically frail individuals. These are only two of the potential applications for this magnetic skin and the soft robots that it will cover, technology that could lead to exciting new robot designs that appear more science fiction than reality.
The magnetic skin is still in development, with the researchers experimenting on creating larger magnetic microparticles or placing the magnetometer in different locations to increase the magnetic field and sensitivity. If the magnetic skin becomes widely integrated, it could revolutionize soft robotics and soft sensing by broadening the limits of robot design, but also change our stereotypes of robots from hard, stainless steel automatons to machines that are capable of feeling similarly to us.
Another day, another step closer to the singularity.

Sufficient pressure inside the brain could prevent seizures from spreading throughout the brain, Carnegie Mellon researchers have found. This discovery has the potential to completely alter how drug-resistant epilepsy is treated.
Epilepsy is among the most common neurological disorders, affecting young and old people alike. Many seizure disorders exist, but all are considered forms of epilepsy. Although the majority of seizure disorders can be treated with medicine, a few strains of epilepsy are drug-resistant. These strains of epilepsy can only be treated with surgery, where surgeons remove tissue to eliminate or minimize seizures 
Dr. Bin He, the Department Head of Biomedical Engineering, and his lab recently published a study in the Annals of Neurology journal alongside researchers from the Mayo Clinic. The study, “Multiple Oscillatory Push-Pull Antagonisms Constrain Seizure Propagation”, describes what may be an important and promising biomarker in the future, finding that focal seizures — seizures which arise from a single point — are able to be regulated by the brain’s push-pull dynamics. 
According to the researchers, an imbalance of excitation-inhibition activity in epileptic networks may allow for the secondary generalization of focal seizures. These researchers speculate that medical professionals could determine whether a seizure will propagate throughout the brain by looking at imbalances between inhibition and excitation of firing of neurons.
"People thought that the spread of seizures mainly depends on where seizures originate in the brain, but the propagation of a seizure is actually regulated by the surrounding tissues, which includes that seizure onset zone. By using an array of electrophysiological recordings, we found that it's not moving outward necessarily; it depends on how much 'pull' a patient receives from the surrounding tissue towards the seizure onset zone, and how much 'push' propagates from the seizure onset zone in the same patient. If that pull is weak, then it's going to spread. If that pull is strong, then we can contain the seizure where it is and prevent it from spreading,” said Dr. He in a press release. 
Currently, medical professionals are aware that drug-resistant focal epilepsy is a network disease, where seizures originate at a single point then propagate throughout the entire brain, spreading alongside differing neuron oscillation frequencies. However, the exact manner in which different networks lead to the spreading of focal seizures remains a mystery.
The researchers contrasted fast and slow brain rhythms, as well as many frequencies of brain activity. They analyzed the rhythmic bands of functional networks, performing analyses of how low and high brain rhythms interact. They used a recently popularized technique known as cross-frequency directionality to analyze 24 focal drug-resistant epilepsy patients. In doing so, they discovered that propagation of seizures in the brain is dependent on a so-called push-pull antagonism control mechanism, which may indicate connections in the epileptic network and may also suppress the seizures. 
Dr. He explained, "This finding will have important implications, and suggests that future treatment options should consider interventions not only upon seizure onset zones, but also the surrounding tissues. Further delineation of critical network nodes may assist the development of treatments for epilepsy using neuromodulation."

Recently Shonen Knife, an all-women punk trio hailing from the underground scene in Japan, came to Pittsburgh for their last show on their North America tour, and The Tartan had a chance to interview them. This is an edited transcription of the original audio interview. All of the questions were answered by the lead guitarist and main founder, Naoko Yamano.
Q: Who are your influences overall? What bands and artists have influenced your music and songwriting style over the decades?
Shonen Knife: When I started Shonen Knife, I liked to listen to The Beatles, and also the late ‘70s punk bands like The Ramones or The Buzzcocks. Now I don’t listen to punk music as much, but now I like to listen to hard rock, R&B, and ‘70s classic rock music.
Q: You’ve mentioned a lot of American groups, but are you influenced by any Japanese music or are you only influenced by non-Japanese music?
SK: No, mainly British and American music.
Q: Generally, what shifts have you seen in the Japanese punk scene, especially women in punk?
SK: I think we are not an actual punk band. The image of a punk band is usually more aggressive, and they sing about politics or anarchy or something. I think we are more of a pop or rock band. But I can say that the underground scene in Japan when we started, there were some all female bands or female rock musicians in Osaka when we started.
Q: You all have been around for a while. Over the course of 19 albums, did your sound evolve naturally or was it ever planned out?
SK: At the beginning, our music was more simple, but the spirit of our music has always been the same. After the ‘90s, we recorded with professional producers and I learned lots of things about recording and arrangement and making music from famous producers. Now we usually record and produce by ourselves. I have improved a lot after the ‘90s.
Q: Shifting away from the music, do you identify as a female band or do you consider yourselves just a band? Is female identity a part of your overall image as an artist and does it impact your music?
SK: We are not feminists, and I don’t think of myself as a female musician. Musicians are musicians. Whether or not they are male or female, there is no meaning to that. So we are just musicians. Since we are an all female band it’s easy because we can share a hotel room and everything is convenient.
Q: That’s interesting to hear because the responses from different all female groups varies. Just to build off the last question, have you ever encountered any barriers for being an all female group in the music scene?
SK: I have not felt any barriers. There is only one thing I find difficult being a woman, and it’s that carrying equipment is very hard. That is the only difference from male bands.
Q: What are some of the differences you see between the Japanese music scene and the non-Japanese music scene?
SK: Our case is very, very rare, and no other Japanese band is touring outside for so long. But Japanese music is usually sung in Japanese, and it is very different from English, especially the phonics. So melody lines in Japanese are much different than melody lines in English. Japanese rock music in general is very different from British and American rock music. But I am inspired by British and American rock music, so for me, English is the language of rock. So I write the lyrics in English.
Q: What would you say are the differences between your interpretation of rock and punk music and your American and British counterparts?
SK: I think our music style is very unique. We have a lot of different styles of songs, ranging from pop-punk to hard rock to ballads. I listen to various kinds of music, especially ‘60s and ‘70s music, and inspired by that, I write something different. So I can’t compare our music style with other bands.
Q: Do you follow along with your fans’ reactions to your music and see how it has changed over the years?
SK: We have a very good reaction from our fans, especially the past ten years, where fans have been getting more energetic. When we started Shonen Knife, we played at a very tiny venue in Osaka, and Japanese audiences are a bit different. But talking about America, they react to our shows with a very positive feeling. They come to our shows to enjoy themselves. So the reaction is always very good.
Q: So that you have said you’re from the Osaka underground scene. Is there something particular about that scene that allowed you to become popular? Like if you were in Tokyo and you tried to do the same thing, do you think you would have become as successful?
SK: I think the underground scene bands in Osaka are more free, and in Tokyo there are many major record companies. Many musicians who want to be popular or famous, they move to Tokyo. But the people who are in Osaka are more free, so a lot of bands from there go abroad, like Acid Mothers Temple and bands like that.
Q: How do you feel about the rise of girl groups like AKB48? Do you think the rise of these groups could be hurting the underground scene?
SK: AKB48 is just made by producers. They are not DIY or independent. But in our case, we do everything ourselves. My sister makes our stage costumes. I am emailing people overseas. AKB48 is kind of just controlled and made to act like cute dolls.
Check out Shonen Knife’s 19th album, Sweet Candy Power, on Spotify or Apple Music.

39 states. 296 performances. Immensely talented musician Joe Goodkin brought his version of The Odyssey to life in 2002, and has since performed his rendition of Homer’s classic all around the United States. Carnegie Mellon University invited Mr. Goodkin to perform last Monday, Sept. 30, through the efforts of Laura Donaldson, assistant director of undergraduate programs for the English department, and Ph.D. student Avery Wiscomb, who teaches the course "Books You Should Have Read by Now."
Goodkin’s 30-minute performance of The Odyssey is entirely written by himself, and is performed with only an acoustic guitar and Goodkin’s voice. Goodkin’s Odyssey illustrates Odysseus’s emotional journey as he makes his way back home to Ithaca, ten years after the end of the Trojan War. Goodkin himself is a trained classicist, hailing from the University of Wisconsin, and has studied various translations of The Odyssey, as well as the original text itself. Thus he made conscious and deliberate decisions when composing his songs, which led to the creation of what he calls “Joe’s Odyssey.” 
After his performance, there was a ten-minute Q&A in which Goodkin explained many of his deliberate decisions. I also had the fortune of having Mr. Goodkin visit my class the next day. Written below are a few of his responses to some questions raised during the performance and classroom Q&A.  
Q: Did you find there was a tradeoff between the visual components [that are from the descriptive narrative] to create these songs?
A: There are always tradeoffs between an older idiom and a newer idiom. Every time you translate something, you lose something, no matter what. Even with Homer’s original text, he translated an oral performance. Embrace this [idea] early on and think of what strengths you can bring to it… classical languages have a beauty English cannot replicate and I fully accept that. But can I create an emotional performance that audiences can resonant with? Absolutely. 
Q: Why did you decide to write in first-person perspective?
A: When I first set out to write this, I did not know what it would be. But a few songs in, I realized I was extracting emotions that lay just below the surface and first person perspective was my way of showing that. 
Q: How do you tune your guitar and was there a particular purpose for it?
A: I use alternate tuning, which is an unfamiliar sequence that is really not heard anywhere else. I wanted the audience to sit a little and just listen… this natural sort of dissonance that I created made me think of water and I wanted audiences to relate to that.”
Q: Throughout your 296 performances or even from night to night, do things change? Like the vibe, the emotions, the atmosphere?
A: While this is the same piece I created from 2002, things still change. The vibe, the emotions, these are just as important as the song itself. There are a lot of factors that can change my performance, whether I have allergies that day or if it is my third performance in two days. All of these things will create a slightly different performance. I like to explain this using an analogy of a boat. If you send a boat out to sea, when it returns is it still the same boat?
Goodkin drew inspiration for his own translation through a variety of factors. One is the idea of the very first performance, before The Odyssey was even transcribed onto paper by Homer. In the days of Ancient Greece, all stories were oral performance and there was a sense of fleeting emotions. Goodkin stated, “When we listen to a story told in a group, we not only have our own reactions to the story, but we perceive the reaction of the group as well.” Thus, Goodkin’s performance, which is often done in front of large crowds of students and others alike, aims to elicit similar emotions. 
As Goodkin said, “Someone already did the best narrative version [of The Odyssey] and that was Homer, so I have to do my own thing.” One of the final thoughts that he left us with is the idea that this story does not belong to anyone, and anyone can do something with it. No one should be afraid to try something new with something old, as Goodkin himself did.

Parasite is the latest film directed by Bong Joon-Ho, who over decades has won both critical and audience acclaim through films such as Memories of Murder, Okja, and Snowpiercer. The movie deals with a series of interactions that take place between a rich and a poor family, beginning when the eldest son of the poor family (played by Choi Woo-Shik) gets hired as an English tutor for a wealthy family, and he tries to fake the identities of his family members and get them hired as servants for the rich family. 
This film won Bong a Palme d’Or at the 72nd Cannes Film Festival this May, as well as acclaim from critics around the world. That acclaim was well-deserved: Parasite is an incredible piece of filmmaking, masterclass in both writing and direction, and stands out as one of the best films to come out this year. Its story is layered, yet uncomplicated, and it’s as surprisingly entertaining as much as it is well-crafted. 
Prior to the film’s release, Bong has said in an interview (translated from Korean): “My intention was not to use this film to analyze the rich and poor gap in a scholarly manner; instead, I wanted to project these ideas onto our everyday characters.” Bong does his best to flesh out these everyday characters and make them as realistic as possible. While many films about class struggles end up simply vilifying the wealthier group in service of the plot, this film deviates from that. No character in this film is purely good or evil; instead, they all feel like real people with complexities and flaws.
On top of realism, the idea of class struggle is depicted through symbolism and imagery. These themes are subtle, yet easy to grasp. Parasite is also incredibly subversive and filled with twists that are in service of the story. So again, avoiding spoilers should be paramount.
This film also flaunts some of Bong’s stylistic touches as a director that have been prominent in his earlier films. The cinematography that moves from top to bottom and vice-versa to convey class difference is one example of how this film employs visual storytelling. Slapstick is used throughout the film with varying effects, and the film is riddled with satirical elements that were also prevalent in Bong’s earlier films. This film also shows an absolute mastery at balancing different tones through the course of the film, taking its audiences from moments of comedy to thrills and shocks. 
This film ultimately leaves its audience both with feelings of incredible satisfaction and bittersweetness. Its mastery in filmmaking and the layered themes will leave both critics and audiences with a lot to talk and think about. In the end, Parasite once again is a testament to why Bong is one of the best foreign directors working today and is deserving of all awards coming its way. Parasite comes out in U.S. theaters on Oct. 11.

Jonathan Lyndale Kirk, known by stage name DaBaby, stepped into the mainstream scene with his first standalone project, Baby on Baby, which released Mar. 1, 2019. The lead single “Suge” on the album made its way to number seven on the Billboard Hot 100, essentially shooting DaBaby onto center stage. Since then, he has accumulated numerous features on the tracks of other up-and-coming artists like Megan Thee Stallion and Lil Nas X.
So what sets his new album apart from the rest of his discography? Mainly, it is DaBaby’s unwavering allegiance to family. The title of his new album, KIRK, is a tribute to his last name, his family name. With the title and album artwork — a picture of him with his father — DaBaby is letting us know what one thing holds this piece of work together: family. DaBaby begins the “INTRO” with a tribute, “Thinkin' 'bout my grandmama and s*** / … thinkin' 'bout my father and s*** / They found him dead a couple days before I started tour / … I was out there with the family / Just lookin' at my daughter / Thinkin' to myself like, ‘Damn, my baby look just like my daddy.’” With these opening lines, we know that KIRK isn’t just the title of his album; it’s the last name of his father, his mother, his grandmother, and his daughter. It is the name that connects all of them and it is a tribute to his family. Throughout the next twelve electrifyingly playful and intensely moving tracks, the audience is transported into the life of DaBaby. Not only is the album full of tributes to his family, but it’s also full of tributes to himself.
So what makes DaBaby special? As Brian Josephs describes it in a Billboard article, it is “the unforced confidence that surrounds him.” This “unforced confidence” is extremely palpable on tracks like “OFF THE RIP,” “BOP,” and “VIBEZ” in a way that it hasn’t been before. These tracks showcase that DaBaby knows he is ‘it’. He knows what he’s got, and he’s not afraid to flaunt it. On the first verse in “OFF THE RIP,” DaBaby shows us that he knows who he is, “I'm just a lil' n**** from Charlotte, the biggest new artist.” DaBaby is not mincing his words. He knows who he is, and he is unafraid to showcase his talent. In “BOP,” DaBaby flexes his work ethic with the line, “I got me a milli', I did it legit-ly” and on “VIBEZ,” he flaunts his lavish lifestyle with the lines, “I'm 'bout to go buy me a coupe / Pull up, make the doors raise the roof.” Not only do these songs present as a tribute to DaBaby himself, but they also show a more playful side to the rapper. 
Ahead of the release of KIRK, DaBaby told Apple Music, “I’m not too serious for myself.” This attitude can be seen clearly through most of the songs on the album. On POP STAR, a song about DaBaby’s success, he makes it clear through the lines, “They prolly tell you I went pop. Until a n**** play with me and he get popped.” Although he is playful, he is not to be played with. In the interlude of OFF THE RIP, DaBaby notes, “you know I just be playin' sometimes,” and this lighthearted side of the rapper can be heard throughout the sometimes cheerful, melodic flute that often accompanies his verses. A reminder that while he may be rapping about his success, his physical altercations, his family, or God, he’s still not taking himself too seriously, and that the carefree side of DaBaby is always present if you’re willing to listen closely enough.

In this series, we give food and drink recommendations for one type of place in five different neighborhoods. This week we’re looking at Thai food, a popular cuisine in Pittsburgh with many options around the city.
Senyai Thai Kitchen — Shadyside
With several menu choices from noodles, curry, and stir-fried dishes, Senyai is one of my favorite restaurants in all of Pittsburgh. Located on the first floor of a converted house on Ellsworth Avenue, it’s cute with a fun vibe and relaxed feel. I recommend anything from the Chef’s Special — I loved the Pad Medmamuang: crispy chicken, cashews, and mixed vegetables tossed in chili sauce.
Tip: go on a nice day and sit on the back patio. As the night gets dark, the colorful lights around the patio will light up your table.
Thai Noodle Outlet — Squirrel Hill
A small place next to the Carnegie Library at the Forbes and Murray intersection, Thai Noodle Outlet is a great option if you’re craving Thai takeout or something casual to sit in with friends. The Pad Thai, which I regularly order from different Thai places, was great, with the right dash of peanut flavor.
Tip: check out the lunch special.
Spice Island Tea House — Oakland
One of the classic staples of my college years, Spice Island doesn’t just offer Thai but a mix of Malaysian, Burmese, Indonesian, and Singaporean dishes. The first thing I ever tried there was the Burmese BBQ chicken thighs in yogurt-curry marinade, which is always a great choice, but I also recommend the Singapore Char Kway Teow: wide rice noodles with shrimp, Chinese sausage, bean sprouts, and spicy sweet soy sauce.
Tip: try the extensive selection of teas. 
Thai Me Up — South Side
Shopping at South Side Works and hungry for Thai food? Try Thai Me Up, a romantic restaurant a couple blocks off E. Carson St. With a wooden rustic aesthetic with fun art design and bright light streaming from the tall windows, enjoy lots of classic and modern choices on the menu. With many entrees, pho, and curry, you could have a party of ten and everyone could order something different.
Tip: spice up your usual Pad Thai order with Pad Thai Mung Bean noodles, which have the classic taste of Pad Thai paired with the stringy glass noodles.
Nicky’s Thai Kitchen — Downtown
A busy place in the middle of Downtown, Nicky’s Thai Kitchen can get pretty crowded during the dinner rush with people getting off of work, but the wait is worth it. With traditional and colorful décor, relax with a large pot of chicken curry.
Tip: try the second location on the North Shore.

This past Wednesday, a group of students gathered outside Palantir’s tech talk, held in the Gates-Hillman Center’s Rashid Auditorium. Some students came to participate in the recruitment event, others were there to join the national #NoTechForICE movement by protesting the recruitment event.
The No Tech For ICE movement, spearheaded by activist group Mijente, has sparked protests at UC Berkeley, Brown, and Yale, resulting in the cancellation of Palantir information sessions at Berkeley and a "pause" in Palantir’s on-campus recruitment at Brown.
Analytics company Palantir has built two tools for ICE, the Investigative Case Management (ICM) tool and FALCON. The ICM system, renewed for around $50 million in Aug. is used for managing and linking case information, while FALCON searches and visualizes several law enforcement databases.
In a statement to The New York Times, Palantir said the tools were meant for the national security-focused Homeland Security Investigation branch of ICE and not the enforcement-focused Enforcement and Removal Operations, but Carnegie Mellon protesters point to uses of the tools in workplace raids and logging interactions with unaccompanied minors. Palantir did not respond to The Tartan's request for comment.
Carnegie Mellon masters student Bonnie Fan launched a petition over two weeks ago, asking students to stop interviewing for positions at Palantir while the company is working with ICE. Kevin Geng, a junior in computer science made a post on the Facebook group Overlooked at Carnegie Mellon, where students highlight social justice issues on campus, suggesting that he would stand outside of the Palantir event to alert potential attendees about the company's involvement with ICE.
Tuesday evening, the day before the talk was scheduled to take place, student organizers met to figure out what kind of action might take place. A Facebook event circulated that night, linking articles about protests at other universities, as well as Fan’s petition.
Though the protest circulated through the channels of campus activist organizations, according to Fan, the event was carried out by a coalition of students who were concerned about "larger issues around recruitment." Fan says that there are people who want to think about social impacts of recruiters around campus, but "there isn't really a space for that."
Carnegie Mellon spokesperson Jason Maderer emailed a statement to The Tartan that highlighted the first amendment rights of all involved, saying "the university supports both the rights of the students protesting and those who wish to consider employment with a particular employer. We worked with the sponsoring department about this week’s event in order to allow for freedom of expression, engagement, and exchange of ideas."
While Palantir held open “office hours” for students, protesters handed out flyers in Spanish and English in the entryway to the Gates Center off of the Pausch Bridge. Once the tech talk began, the protesters moved outside the fourth-floor auditorium where it was held, moving outside of the fourth-floor Forbes Avenue entryway to give speeches.
Alisar Mustafa, a masters student who helped organize the protest, was surprised that people showed up, given that the protests had largely been planned the night before. She believes that the fact that the protests speak “specifically to ICE and deportation” might make them more accessible to the large international population at Carnegie Mellon.
“It’s hard to draw the line,” said organizer and masters student, Brian Rhindress, to identify employers meriting protest since Carnegie Mellon draws many big recruiters involved in defense and law enforcement. However, Rhindress says, while there are a lot of students parsing which employers meet their ethical standards, there are “a lot of students who just don’t know.”
Palantir’s tech talk itself centered around a demonstration of one of Palantir’s software platforms in the scenario of a fictionalized automobile recall. Palantir security asked attendees to refrain from taking photos or tweeting during the event.
The first several questions in the Q and A portion of the event came from protesters. Atahan Kiliccote, a sophomore in Mechanical Engineering, asked about the use of Palantir's FALCON platform in ICE raids. Responses from Palantir recruiters focused on the distinction between working with the investigative and enforcement branches of ICE, and the internal discussion process that led to the choice to continue working with ICE.
Eventually, one of the attendees asked about the difference between the kinds of engineers at the company, and the discussion moved to more standard fare. Soon thereafter, the question portion ended, and the recruiters invited interested students to the front to network. 
Atahan Kiliccote, mentioned in this article, is also a staffwriter at The Tartan.

Dr. Kiron Skinner, the Director of the Institute for Politics and Strategy (IPS) and the former Director for Policy Planning at the Department of State, is back on campus after being dismissed from her role in the State Department. The Tartan spoke to three current students and one alum of the International Relations and Politics program, which Skinner directs, about the circumstances around her dismissal from the State Department and her return to the University. All were willing to go on the record with The Tartan under the condition of anonymity,  because they’re currently under her authority in IPS or for fear of future career repercussions.
“There’s an environment of fear and intimidation that permeates people who especially rely on her for any sort of hope of career advancement as a student. If you want to succeed, you need to lean on her connections to get you where you want to go in D.C.,” said one alum of the program. Politico reported that Skinner was dismissed from her role in the state department over an “abusive” management style, with anonymous State Department sources alleging that she made homophobic comments, accused people of having affairs, and abused her authority. In an interview with The Tartan, she denied making any homophobic remarks and characterized some of the reporting as being “out of context.”
“I think in terms of my experience with her as an instructor, she was strict but fair. It was really when I brought up concerns about the new masters program where things really got out of hand,” said the alum. The alum, during their time as a student, had brought up concerns about the master’s program which were perceived by Skinner as criticism, leading to “nasty” conversations between them.
A current undergraduate student of the program brought up concerns about the reputation of IPS. “As a student, it personally hurts me to have someone like her be the head of the department when I’m seeking future work — it hurts my personal reputation as a Carnegie Mellon student to be associated with her and her track record.”
Another undergraduate student said that they are still cautious, as they haven’t been here that long, nor do they know Skinner personally. Attempting to sort through everything that they’ve heard and choosing what to believe is very difficult. “Especially among the undergrads, we are very scared to even talk about what happened because it’s just not within our power. There’s an obvious, huge, power gap between us, as undergrad students, and Skinner, who’s the head of the department.” It’s difficult, they say, to ask questions, since as an undergrad in the department “your chances are riding on what you say and what you do.”
Several students want the administration to be more transparent. “CMU definitely struggles with the perception that it doesn’t care about its students,” remarked the previously mentioned alum.
“CMU loves to be neutral on everything; as long as Dr. Skinner didn’t literally set fire to the White House, they’ll be okay with her,” a current student expressed. “And it’s really unsettling that Dietrich just wants to bury this instead of addressing it head-on.”
Another student commented, “I think transparency is just the biggest thing. Because right now, what it feels like is happening is just everyone’s left in the dark, and we’re just hearing from outside sources and vague statements from Skinner and trying to maybe address what’s going on but not really. If people were more forthright and direct about what’s going on, I think the students would feel less ambivalent about the situation.”
In an interview with the Tartan in September, Skinner admitted that she misspoke when she made a controversial statement during a security forum in Washington D.C. regarding the U.S.’s relationship with China as a growing power. Skinner had said, “it’s the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian,” and accepted that the criticism directed towards her was legitimate. She clarified that “China is very different than other competitors we have had” and that “we have to take China on its own terms. A lot more seriously.”
Skinner is holding a discussion on US-China relations on Monday, Oct. 7, 2019. In an email announcing the event, she acknowledged the previous controversial remarks she had made during her tenure in the State Department on competition between US and China. She wrote, “It is therefore my duty as an academic within a world-class university to open up dialogue with our students to hear their concerns about US-China relations, with particular regard to global competition and the trade war, so that we can work together towards building a strong US-China policy.”
One of the students who spoke to the Tartan welcomed the event, expressing hope that “being able to hear it directly from her” instead of from the media, which they said could be conflating and exaggerating her points, would help get more insight into her foreign policy thinking and her controversial statements. “In regards to the other more personal issues, I don’t think that will probably ever be addressed,” the student said.
Skinner declined to comment on this article, saying she could not effectively respond without advance viewing of the article.
The discussion on US-China relations will be held by Skinner on Monday, Oct. 7, from 4:30 pm to 5:30 pm in the Cohon University Center’s McConomy Auditorium. A second meeting, also led by Skinner, was announced Sunday night, in which all IPS students and faculty are invited to attend. That meeting will take place from 5:30 to 6:30 pm in the same location, immediately after the previous meeting.

If you’ve been on campus at all this semester, you might have noticed the new and improved signs outside campus buildings, with handy elements like the building name, its SIO abbreviation, the address, and a red square reading “Carnegie Mellon University.” Not just a refresh of old and worn out signage, these markers signify a new era in the Carnegie Mellon brand. The webpage for the newly-defined “Brand” defines it as “the perception formed in the mind of our audiences at every point of contact — verbal or visual,” reminding us that “words and images used to represent the Carnegie Mellon University brand reflect who we are as an institution.”
Brian James, the Senior Director of Creative at Carnegie Mellon, told The Tartan that the development of the brand, which officially launched a few weeks ago, was a process that took “in its entirety, about two years, just shy of two years.” The impetus for the brand refresh came with the formation of the Marketing and Communications group at Carnegie Mellon in 2015, with “an overall objective to increase the awareness and reputation of Carnegie Mellon University globally.”
For the first step in this development process, Carnegie Mellon contracted an “external research group” to review “the current state of our reputation and the current state of our awareness,” speaking with students, alumni, faculty and staff, and members of the general public to get a sense of the “different personalities that are strong within our university.” These personalities formed a set of three archetypes which form the general idea of Carnegie Mellon. According to the “Personality” page on the brand website, “CMU’s character, defined by our rich history and personality traits, is equal parts SAGE, HERO and OUTLAW,” meaning that not only is Carnegie Mellon “INGENIOUS,” “PASSIONATE,” and “QUIRKY,” but also “BOLD,” “VISIONARY,” and “ENTREPRENEURIAL,” that last trait one of the signature “OUTLAW” characteristics.
These archetypes help guide the general mood of the brand, the purpose of which is to “create the foundation for the communications from the universities,” whether those be blog posts, news articles, or general media releases from the university. The very public nature of the brand and its guiding principles seems to be unique to Carnegie Mellon. Other universities in the same vein, such as MIT, Yale, or Stanford, lack even basic materials about their messaging and media.
In contrast to the bare-bones offerings of other universities, the brand page includes a full gigabyte of university materials, from variations on the mascot, Scotty, to an abstract, waving graphic of Carnegie Mellon’s signature Tartan pattern, to the previously-mentioned Carnegie Mellon square that adorns the new signage.
According to James, that square is a new inclusion in the “visual identity downloads from the website,” since designers in the past “had to create it on their own,” resulting in some inconsistencies. The expanded visual identity downloads were a result of “really thinking about the students, [who] do some fantastic work…always trying to create pride and use the brand.” The university sought to “really be collaborative with everyone that’s trying to use the brand,” and hopes that access to these materials will allow people to “do the things they need to do with it.”
The sleek, comprehensive brand identity seems more in line with tech companies like Uber or Google, with breakdowns of the various branding elements and motivations. According to the brand website, “as a young university, [Carnegie Mellon] is free from many of the silos and bureaucracy that harden over time, dimming ambitions and slowing momentum,” and “whether it’s from Silicon Valley or Broadway, Wall Street, Washington, D.C. or Pittsburgh, innovators and disrupters come to work with CMU, because we get things done.”
This youthful vigor and close collaboration with outside forces seem to exert a corresponding pressure to be as much like the hip new startups as possible, moving fast and breaking things. After all, we Carnegie Mellon outlaws are “rule benders. [We] veer away from conventions, challenge authority. Make new rules and do whatever it takes to achieve the goal.”

On Oct. 5, 2019, the Pittsburgh March for Peace walked from Schenley Plaza to the Software Engineering Institute, and then to Carnegie Mellon's campus entrance to protest the university's involvement with the United States military. In one distributed pamphlet, organizers stated that "your presence [at this protest] shows the militarists, CIA goons, and war hawk politicians that people in America are sick of war and are willing to do something about it."
The protest was endorsed by several local organizations, among them, the Allegheny County Democratic Black Caucus, the Green Party of Allegheny County, the Thomas Merton Center, and the Veterans for Peace of Western Pennsylvania. 
As the group marched from the Software Engineering Institute to Carnegie Mellon's Walking to the Sky, protesters chanted, "No tech for ICE." Protesters objected to the development of technology for law enforcement and the military at Carnegie Mellon. In a Veterans for Peace of Western Pennsylvania description of the protest, organizers note that they seek to "end Pittsburgh’s role in the global military industrial complex that exploits so many in the name of profit rich and wealthy."
The protest had 3 main demands, according to another distributed pamphlet. They were: "1. We demand an immediate end to all forms of war in which the United States is currently engaged. 2. We demand an immediate reduction of the U.S. military budget by at least half, including nuclear weapon divestment, with reinvestment into social and infrastructure programs. 3. We demand an end to the militarization of domestic law enforcement organizations."

Following student requests for an Office of Sustainability late last month, Carnegie Mellon University is touting green updates to the school’s infrastructure. This past Monday, the university announced that it is now purchasing wind power.
At the end of last month, Carnegie Mellon and ENGIE Resources announced energy agreements spanning from this year to 2024. Carnegie Mellon will buy its energy from Radford’s Run Wind Farm in Macon County, IL for its Pittsburgh campus. Eventually, that wind farm will serve all campus electricity needs.
Steven Guenther, Director of Facilities Operations at Carnegie Mellon, told The Tartan about Carnegie Mellon’s history of environmental initiatives and the Radford’s Run Wind Farm partnership.
Guenther says that “anything that uses electricity on campus — lights, computers, food preparation, air conditioning — will be powered by a renewable energy source.” The university says this effort will make a substantial impact, akin to the removal of more than 21,000 passenger motor vehicles from highways over a two year span.
Guenther is especially optimistic about the merits of Carnegie Mellon’s move to wind energy. He told The Tartan that renewable energy generators, like Radford’s Run Wind Farm, create two sources of value: electricity and, following federal law, a renewable energy certificate (REC) upon generating one megawatt-hour of power.
“The REC represents the social and environmental benefits of a megawatt-hour of clean energy. You can think of it as the mirror image of a carbon tax; rather than putting a negative value on carbon emissions, it puts a positive value on clean generation,” Guenther explained.
Carnegie Mellon’s energy usage is tracked by its Green-e certified RECs, as the university has spent the past decade offsetting its electric power consumption by purchasing RECs.
“Buying 100% renewable energy is exciting and supports the Provost’s recent announcement of the Sustainability Initiative. The wind power commitment is one of many examples of engaged efforts in support of the broader definition of sustainability afforded by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),” Guenther told us.
Other campus environmental initiatives include the installation of almost 500,000 gallons of rainwater storage for reuse in campus buildings, which will offset municipal water consumption and reduce the burden on the sewer system. Spots on campus like the rain gardens in front of the Cohon University Center and the Posner Center’s green roof are an extension of this effort. The Tepper Quadrangle, opened last year, was Carnegie Mellon’s 22nd LEED certified campus project.
“The biggest sustainability initiative in our history could be the Provost’s commitment to grow awareness of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals and elevate the university’s engagement with the SDGs,” Guenther noted.
The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) acknowledged Carnegie Mellon’s environmental initiatives, awarding them with gold status (surpassing the university’s 2015 silver rating). Carnegie Mellon also ranked 63rd in the nation in Sierra Club’s 2019 Cool Schools ranking of environmentally-friendly colleges. Additionally, Carnegie Mellon was one of the 42 institutions recognized by the International Sustainable Campus Network and Global University Leader Forum in the 2018 Educating With Purpose Report.
Carnegie Mellon is affiliated with a few environmental groups, including the AASHE and the American Campuses Act on Climate Pledge. Carnegie Mellon’s Scott Institute for Energy Innovation hosts Energy Week, which brings together 100 leaders from 67 academic energy institutes and centers from 32 states to discuss future energy initiatives.
Though Carnegie Mellon does not have an Office of Sustainability, it now has a new advisory council focused on engagement with the SDGs set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015.
In a statement, Guenther stated that “our university’s focus includes education, research, and practice in building environmentally sustainable, peaceful, just and inclusive communities. We are blessed with wonderful people doing amazing work on issues connected to the SDGs. Unfortunately, that work may not be widely known or connected to similar efforts. The Sustainability Initiative is intended to discover our strengths and weaknesses to inform a future decision.”

In 1969, The Tartan reported that the Carnegie Mellon Student Senate claimed: “a demonstration on the CMU campus was about as unlikely as a meteor hitting Warner Hall.” A week later, that statement was proven false when students and faculty marched to protest campus construction and supported the Black Construction Coalition and black construction workers in Pittsburgh. Even at the time, the student body was known to be “apathetic," but that protest showed that students cared about the issues and have the ability to get involved. 
There are a lot of parallels that can be made between then and now. Both periods are eras of political turmoil and identity shifts in a polarized landscape, so it is becoming increasingly important for us to be involved. Our senators, representatives, and executive branch don’t represent the nation’s best interests. The cliché idea thrown around is that our generation is the only one capable of fixing the mess left behind by decades of bad policy and half-measures based on compromises with saboteurs who were only in it for their own gain. While we certainly are not the only ones capable, we are the ones who will have to deal with the consequences. It’s our obligation to be involved and change the course of our present and future. 
So how does our campus step up to the obligation to be involved with the issues? We spoke to 24 students across campus and asked them three questions: First, how politically involved are you? Second, how politically aware do you find the campus body as a whole? Third, what are the ways Carnegie Mellon students can get more involved in the issues?
For political involvement, six people answered “really involved,” (four of them were international relations majors) eight people answered “somewhat involved," five people answered “a little bit involved," and five people answered “not interested at all." But in response to the question regarding political awareness on campus, only four people answered “really involved” while 14 out of the 24 respondents answered “a little bit involved." The six respondents who answered “somewhat involved” for this question also strongly indicated that students could do more. “It’s definitely better than I thought it would be for a tech school,” says Nick Bellante, a junior studying both international relations and politics and policy and management. 
Of course, this shouldn’t be taken as a statistically significant representation of campus political awareness, but it still speaks volumes that many students in a relatively random survey, most of whom aren’t connected to each other beyond going to the same university, were critical of the campus’s lack of political awareness. It’s disheartening to see because it’s important for the student body to understand the political and ethical ramifications of the work that the university is engaged in, such as military research.
“I can count on one hand the number of protests that have happened at CMU. Can you think of a lot of the direct actions that have happened at CMU in the last year?” says Maggie Oates, a Ph.D. student studying societal computing.
Many respondents were quick to point out why they thought this was the case. Some noted the job prospects for students. “People at this school especially are more focused on the monetary aspect of their degree, like ‘can this degree get me paid?’” says Ruel Beresford, a junior double majoring in biochemistry and international relations and politics. Others noted the university’s work culture as a significant factor in its political apathy. “We’re all so busy that we can’t be expected to know everything about everything, but I still think that’s not an excuse to not know anything,” says Yash Hari, a senior studying statistics and machine learning. Some international students also noted their discomfort. “The thing is I am international, so I don’t like to give my political views here,” says Spandan Sharma, a sophomore studying electrical and computer engineering. 
Career building is one of the goals of coming to college, but it’s not an excuse to ignore the impact of the tech giants who hire our students. Students who don’t take the time to research the company or contractor they want to work for further enables these companies to engage in dubious work. However, the university should be doing more to engage with companies who aren’t doing work for institutions that violate human rights. Additionally, students shouldn’t be so caught up in their work and career goals that they forgo political involvement. These conversations are difficult, and it won’t be possible if people check out because they don’t want to deal with it. We should encourage each other, including international students, to take part in the discourse. 
That leaves us with the final question: what are ways to get Carnegie Mellon students more involved? All the survey respondents had a wide array of answers. 
“There should be four required courses for everyone at the university, especially STEM majors: an ethics course, a politics course, a history course, and a writing course,” says Austin Goetz, a junior majoring in international relations and politics.
“There should be more signs everywhere having students register to vote,” says Omar Elmady, a junior majoring in psychology. 
“It would be cool to see university sponsored, non-partisan events that are from [the university’s] point of view rather than just having clubs sponsoring it,” says Navid Mamoon, a sophomore studying business administration. 
“If we reduce the stress culture, then students will find the time to join organizations and be able to be more politically involved and think about these types of issues instead of just constantly thinking about the next assignment,” says Reneé Nikolov, a sophomore studying international relations and politics and behavioral economics. 
There is a shifting dynamic on campus with students wanting to get more involved, and many of them have indicated their ideas on what the student body and administration should do. It’s on us all to get involved, and we should be doing all that we can to do so, including our administration.

“What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society who abandons him and treats him like trash? You get what you f**king deserve.” This is the last thing Arthur Fleck says as he completes his transformation into the titular Joker with a graphic display on national television. 
Leaving the theater last Thursday, I felt gross and numb as I tried to make sense of what I had just witnessed. Multiple critical reviews described Joker as being something of “an anthem for incels” — involuntary celibate people — but once the film became available to a wider audience, it became apparent that this film is not a promotion of incel ideology.
But where did this notion come from, and how does Joker really connect to our society? It isn’t difficult to see how this movie could be interpreted as incel-friendly. Arthur is a friendless young man with a mental illness who lives with his mother in his seemingly meaningless life. He meets a woman who lives down the hall, but his attraction towards her never leads to an intimate relationship. Identity crisis and a failed romance subplot alone don’t make someone an incel, though.
While Arthur does fit most of the demographics of the present-day incel community — almost entirely men under 30 years old — his worldview is distinct from that of incels. The “inceldom” is a subset of the manosphere. Members of the manosphere believe that only the most attractive and successful men attract women and that men are either alpha Chads, forever alone, or “normie beta cucks.”
Going beyond the “red-pilling”, or entering the manosphere, incels can also consume the “black pill”. This is essentially misogyny-driven catastrophizing, where incels believe that immutable physical, mental, or social characteristics leave them with no hope at having a sexual relationship — and therefore no happiness. All they can do is “lie down and rot”. After watching Joker, I can confidently state that this is not who the Joker is. While I haven’t been able to pin down what Arthur’s specific worldview and motives are, his anger and frustration were in no way directed towards women.
It’s concerning that people have taken Arthur and flattened his entire character down to being a representative for a community in the dark corner of the internet. Arthur has serious problems in his life that he has little to no agency over. 
He and his mother were abused while he was a child. The hysterical laughter caused by his mental condition makes his peers view him as a “freak.” He must care for his mother alone in a run-down apartment. He’s unable to receive adequate mental health services because of cuts to social programs. He is a product of the broken system he’s lived in, his behavior largely molded by external factors.
The reason, I believe, that early viewers were so quick to label the Joker as a hero for incels is that many people don’t actually understand who incels are or the process of falling into the vicious cycles that lead people to take the black pill. However, there also appears to be a wider misunderstanding of what leads individuals to adopt radical worldviews. 
Too often, people will view extremists with disdain and dismiss them as simply vile people, rather than taking the time to understand that they’re vulnerable members of our society. They are people who have become susceptible to dangerous ideologies and have fallen through the cracks because of systemic socio-economic failures. Arthur, the Joker, is one of these people.
What Joker can tell us is that it’s incumbent upon us to provide a support network for people in danger of falling into the same descent that Arthur does in this movie. Seeing it happen stretched out over a two-hour film, Joaquin Phoenix’s portrayal of this complicated journey will make people uncomfortable and uneasy. That makes sense. It shouldn’t feel enjoyable or exhilarating watching someone’s life and mind fall apart, but this happens every day to members of our society who feel hopeless or punched down.
Over the course of the film, Arthur repeatedly finds his life being chipped away or made worthless. He loses his job because a coworker throws him under the bus for having a weapon. The social worker he visits appears to offer little support for him and once that public service is defunded, he loses his access to psychiatric medications.
His trust in society is broken after what he experiences. He discovers from his mother the true identity of his father, but later is told that his mother had been placed in a mental hospital with delusions while Arthur was a young boy (in fact, he was actually adopted). After Arthur performs at a local comedy club, his hero, talk show host Murray Franklin, mocks him when clips of his set are shown on-air. He feels lied to by the only two people he’s placed trust in. At that point, for vulnerable people like Arthur, reality stops mattering. 
In his journal, Arthur writes, “I hope my death will make more cents than my life.” This is what extremism can lead one to, a loss of meaning in one’s life that they (incorrectly) think only death could fulfill. It’s what’s been happening to the people being radicalized on our always connected but socially isolating internet. Hopeless people, after facing repeated failure in their lives with no sense of improvement, seek explanations for their despair. For these people, often mentally ill or under severe social pressures, radical beliefs such as the ones offered by incels help them make sense of the world, while guiding them towards the nihilistic death cult black pilling leads to.
After mulling through all this, I found myself asking the question: How could we have stopped Arthur from becoming the Joker? While I still don’t have an exact answer, I do believe there are approaches we could use to prevent people from going down the path of extremism that Arthur went down. It’s clear that isolation is unhealthy for everyone. Lost in a void without meaningful connections, the emotional wear this would have on someone transcends material status, but especially for people under powerful economic and professional stress.
We need to do more to ensure that people have adequate support systems to help keep them from drifting off into radicalizing internet forums. We can establish better mental health infrastructure for this and perhaps promote more social interaction for those on the fringes. 
Using incels as an example, we can create positive support groups and teach social skills to help would-be incels form positive friendships (and potentially, romantic relationships) rather than feel driven to form viciously unhealthy relationships with members of the incel community. There’s something deeper, though, about our society’s interpersonal culture and how we humanize — or dehumanize — others. Somehow, this needs to be shifted in order for us to address the Joker’s type of nihilistic attitude towards people and institutions that have permeated throughout radicalizers. 
Arthur wants to be treated with decency and wants to live a respectful life, but when he is essentially pushed out of society and has his identity wiped, he becomes the Joker, similar to how vulnerable people can become incels. Once it feels like all you can do is “lie down and rot”, violent revenge on those who wronged you seems much more appealing.
We live in a society. No one should have to live through it as Arthur does.

Living through the Trump Administration has been exhausting, the past three years feeling like three decades. We have found ourselves wondering if each political scandal would be the scandal.
On Sept. 24, Speaker Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald J. Trump. He is now the fourth President of the United States to face impeachment.
A few weeks ago, there were rumors of a whistleblower complaint in the intelligence community, which alleged that Donald Trump withheld foreign aid to Ukraine until they committed to investigating Hunter Biden, Former Vice President Biden’s son. These rumors, which took Washington by storm, were quickly proven to be true. On CNN, Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, stated that the President asked Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Trump also confirmed this to be true when pressed by reporters on the White House lawn. 
Corroborating evidence for these admissions came when the White House released a summary of the transcript of Trump’s call with President Zelensky of Ukraine. The summary alone is damning for Donald Trump. On it, when President Zelensky brings up U.S. military aid to Ukraine, Trump says, “I would like you to do us a favor though.” This is the very phrase that historians will mention when writing about Trump's impeachment process.
Two days after Speaker Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry, the House Intelligence Committee released the whistleblower complaint, which corroborated everything in the call transcript with Ukraine. The complaint confirmed that other people witnessed Trump’s mob-like behavior with Ukraine, which the Committee is continuing to investigate.
Though we have long known about Trump’s violations of the Constitution’s emoluments clause and his obstruction of justice as relayed in the Mueller Report, this Ukraine whistleblower scandal has struck a chord with the American people. The President of the United States violated the Constitution by asking a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 presidential election, threatening to withhold taxpayer-funded foreign aid. This behavior should not be normalized, and it seems that the House Democrats are finally prepared to uphold their Constitutional duty.
Throughout the many scandals of the Trump Presidency, Democrats, including Maxine Waters, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, and Al Green have repeatedly called for Trump’s impeachment. Nancy Pelosi has had a more methodological approach, preferring to work through the courts instead of impeachment procedures. It is important to realize that although Speaker Pelosi did not reach her decision to open an impeachment inquiry quickly or enthusiastically, she knew that it was the only way to protect what the Founding Fathers imagined for our country.
Conducting an impeachment inquiry on Donald Trump is risky, especially for the many moderate Democrats in the House that flipped red districts. Speaker Pelosi was slow to open impeachment into Trump because she wanted to protect these representatives, many of whom now support impeachment due to growing demands from their constituents, but with the Ukraine whistleblower scandal, it seems that there is a bigger political risk for the Republicans and some conservative Democrats who continue to stay silent on the matter. Public opinion polls from Morning Consult and Politico show that 51% of Americans support Trump’s impeachment, a number that has never been higher.
This scandal has Republicans sweating. Kevin McCarthy, Minority Leader of the House, went on 60 Minutes to defend Trump and his administration. McCarthy’s interview with Scott Pelley was almost too brutal to watch. Republicans usually excel in conducting unified messaging strategies, but it is clear that they are not sure what to do in this given circumstance. They are terrified to speak out against Trump, for fear of not being reelected. Former Arizona Senator Jeff Flake said that he talked to his former colleagues and that if the impeachment vote in the Senate were anonymous, at least 30 Republicans would vote to convict Trump. This is the Republican Party’s last chance to choose between Trump and the Constitution of the United States. 
So, how can Democrats win this political fight? They already are winning. They chose to open an impeachment inquiry to protect and defend our Constitution, and ensure that our elections are free and fair. Mitch McConnell, the Majority Leader of the Senate, has vowed to stop impeachment from going to the Senate in his latest fundraising push, which is similar to how he has not taken up any of the legislation that the House passed in this new session of Congress.
In the 2020 election cycle, Democrats aim to flip several seats in the Senate. The last thing the Senate Republicans want to do is vote on impeachment. Senators like Susan Collins, Martha McSally, and Cory Garder are among the most vulnerable Republicans, and a vote against impeachment could cost them their re-election, given that their states have been trending blue in recent years.
Impeachment votes are not anonymous, and the Republican Party is now the Party of Trump, so it is unlikely that Congressional Republicans will risk their reelection on an impeachment vote. When an impeachment is brought to the floors of both chambers of Congress, many Republicans — and possibly some moderate Democrats — will vote against it. That “nay” vote will be a stain on their records. The history books will show that these are the individuals who chose power over protecting our constitution. 
When announcing the impeachment inquiry, Speaker Pelosi quoted the Founders, saying, “the times have found us.” And, when these times are over, those members of Congress that voted against impeachment to protect their political futures will be remembered as cowards and traitors to the United States of America.

Investing in stocks is an expensive venture. Depending on the stocks you’re interested in, the price per share can be well over $1,000. Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG), for example, have a price per share of around $1,725 and $1,200, respectively. To own even one share of these companies would require a nontrivial sum, not to mention 10 or 20 shares.
Moving away from the high end of the spectrum, the cheaper options out there still boast substantial price tags. Companies like AT&T (T), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Coca Cola (KO) hover around $35 to $50 per share. While much more affordable than the $1,000+ per share mentioned previously, it’s still not cheap to become invested in these securities. You could opt for even cheaper stocks and possibly venture into the penny stock territory, but that often comes with higher risk and higher volatility.
Knowing this, wouldn’t it be great if there was an investment vehicle where you could own lots of companies at once without shelling out thousands of dollars at a time? That’s the exact philosophy behind both exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds, both of which give investors diversification in holdings at a lower price as opposed to picking individual securities and investments.
ETFs and mutual funds are similar in that both have an underlying collection of investments, often focusing on one market sector. When investors buy into an ETF or a mutual fund, they indirectly invest the money into the securities contained in that fund rather than having to pay the price per share for each stock or investment, which means that the initial amount one has to shell out is a lot lower. This means that instead of buying shares of Exxon (XOM), Apple (AAPL), and Adobe Systems (ADBE) separately, you can buy into a fund that tracks the S&P 500 and invest in these and many other stocks automatically for a far lower price. Investing in a fund means you’re investing in a pre-made portfolio and your fortunes depend on how well the constituents of that portfolio are doing.
With a low price tag, instant diversification, and more balanced risks, it’s easy to see why funds are so popular: they take the guesswork out of investing and are a great way for beginning investors to gain a foothold in the market, especially those who do not have the time to monitor the market and want a passive investment approach. Furthermore, most funds only boast a modest expense ratio: the fees you pay for owning some of the funds. This means that the amount you’re losing to fees is generally outweighed by your gains, though this is highly dependent on the performance of the ETF.
There are two key differences between ETFs and mutual funds that are important to understand before investing in either one. First, ETFs are traded like stocks, whereas mutual funds are traded only at the end of the day. This means that if you want to buy 50 shares of an ETF, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) for example, you can execute that order instantly and get the market price you saw at the instant that you decided to buy. Once the order is executed, you then own 50 shares of the ETF and that’s that. ETFs can also be traded like stocks, so selling and buying them are performed like any other routine transaction on the market.
Mutual funds, on the other hand, are traded at the end of the day. For example, say that you wanted to buy into a mutual fund during the trading day, and say that its current trading price is $40 per share. You then initiate a trade by putting up $1000, but the trade is not executed at that moment. Instead, you must wait until 4:00 pm EST before the trade goes through, and your $1000 is used to purchase as many shares as possible at the closing price. Thus, purchasing a mutual fund puts you at risk of price fluctuations throughout the day.
The second key difference is that mutual funds are actively managed while ETFs are not always managed. This means that an actual portfolio manager is overseeing the operations of the mutual fund, whereas ETFs are passively managed and simply track their target market sector. While it may sound comforting to hear that your money will have more oversight in a mutual fund, it’s important to note that most actively managed funds fail to outperform passively managed funds in the long-term. It’s for this reason that in recent years, ETFs have become more popular than mutual funds as an investment tool among both active and passive traders. Simply tracking the market rather than trying to game the market leads to average and consistent returns over time and minimizes the risks that come with frequent buying and selling of securities. That’s not to say that ETFs and passively managed funds never change: all funds are rebalanced depending on the performance of the market, so fund compositions are rarely immutable.
So, with this general oversight of ETFs and mutual funds, the question remains: how do you invest in these funds?
The answer is simple, just go out and buy shares of a fund via online trading or brokerage account! With online trading services from companies like Vanguard and Fidelity, buying securities on the market is easier than ever. Of course, before you buy you should first do your research on what the fund is focused on and what its outlook is. If a prospectus is offered, and it usually is, take the time to read it. The prospectus is a packet of information for potential shareholders and outlines both the expenses of investing in the fund and its major holdings, as well as the projected growth of a $10,000 investment. And as always, when it comes to buying securities, understand that your time in the market is more important than timing the market. This is especially true with funds since you are exposed to a mix of investments rather than individual company stocks. Holding on to investments for the long term is better than rapid buying and selling since you don’t miss out on long-term growth and dividend payments. Volatility in the short-term is unnerving, but understand that in the long-term, the market generally trends upwards. There is always the risk of losing money when investing, so be sure that you never invest more than you can afford to lose.
Next time, we’ll talk about trading commodities on the market and how things like oil, gold, and silver can be traded much like stocks.

The arena is brutal, unforgiving, very public — and yes, at times, rewarding. Whether you are in policy, sports, academia, or business, the characteristics of the arena are basically the same. And despite its shortcomings, the arena is where lasting impact happens, so take the plunge.
In one of my earliest forays into the arena, I ran for class office when I was in 7th grade.  Each candidate gave a speech to the student body during an outside assembly. I arrived in a pink dress, white stockings, ballet flats, perhaps a tad of makeup, and a bow in my long, flowing hair. The other contenders wore jeans and T-shirts. 
I knew I was pushing the envelope, but I also knew that I had to give a strong address. I wanted to break the color line in my school’s elections. I wanted to change the conversation on campus.  I wanted more open-minded and informed teachers. I wanted them to recognize Egypt as part of the African continent, and I was furious when they refused to do so. I had a voice, I wanted to lead, and I was forceful in my delivery. With only 35 black kids in a student body of 700, I thought I needed a theme to catch everyone’s attention, so I had titled my campaign speech “Chance.”  I said, “Give me a chance just the way the tennis world gave Billie Jean King a chance.” (Billie Jean had become one of my idols when she defeated Bobby Riggs in the Battle of the Sexes). At the end of my speech, the cheerleaders went wild and the whole crowd joined in to give me a standing ovation.  
By that point, I was well on my way to becoming a serial class-office seeker. Throughout my school days, I would win some elections by convincing enough classmates to vote for me, but I’d also lost some contests. This time was different. I won the election but the school authorities claimed I had lost. Tipped off by a teacher who was skeptical about the outcome, my mother demanded a recount. As it turned out, I had won by a landslide. My “Chance” speech might have been too strong for some faculty members and administrators, who were probably responsible for changing the results of the election. It was a dramatic and highly unusual situation for my California junior high school. I assumed my office and, to my knowledge, that was the last time a student election was compromised at my junior high school.
I was reminded of that episode when I was dismissed recently from the State Department. In the U.S. federal government, there is but one think-tank for foreign policy: the Office of Policy Planning at the State Department. Because of the pace of U.S. foreign policy and demands on the Secretary of State and the President, policy planning has become an extension of the Secretary of State’s operations.  Secretary Pompeo wanted a course correction and tasked me to manage it. I took him literally and attempted to do it all at once.
From the first day on the job, I began assembling interdisciplinary teams of career officials and political appointees, including faculty from civilian and military universities and think-tank scholars, to work on regional and functional problems.  I unleashed them to define the Trump Doctrine, turning the president’s hunches into hypotheses, and I watched with admiration as they engaged hundreds of State Department officials in red-team exercises on Iraq, Libya, Yemen, and other hot spots.  The Policy Planning Staff led meeting groups on a dozen cross-cutting challenges such as the use of sanctions to change the behavior of foreign leaders and public diplomacy for the 21st century. Policy planning was on its way back to the original model.
I have found that people who are deeply invested in an enterprise welcome rapid change and support their leader. Those who are invested in the status quo, however, can be formidable in obstructing progress. Often, their objectives tend to be narrow and clear: tackle and block. 
So, know the following: if you succeed only in shifting the expectations about what is possible, you will have won. In other words, you win even when the authorities say you have lost. To this day, I consider “Chance” to be my best political speech, one that continues to inform all of my actions inside the arena. At State, I took a chance, and have influenced the expectations about what is possible.
