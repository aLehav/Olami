To senior policy and management and social and political history double major Eliza Donohue, losing has never been an option — at least not since she was in seventh grade. At 12 years old, Donohue began her competitive volleyball career. Inspired by her dad, brother, and sister, she continued with the sport for ten full years, even being recruited to Carnegie Mellon’s team during high school. Donohue pushed herself to new limits during the time she played for Carnegie’s Women’s Varsity Volleyball team and made the All-University Athletic Association (UAA) team this past month.
Playing middle blocker, Donohue is responsible for both blocking the opposing team’s hits and executing kills. Her skills in this area were noticed by other coaches in the UAA, who later voted her onto the All-UAA team. These coaches are from various teams within the UAA conference — not just from Carnegie Mellon — which only increases the prestige of being elected to the position.
“We have to play every team in our conference so all the coaches see all the players and then they pick who they think should be recognized on the All-UAA team; [this year] the other UAA coaches recognized my contributions to my team,” said Donohue.
Donohue also takes on the responsibility of training younger players to navigate the game and its stresses as co-captain. Donohue claims the ability to do so leads them to keep a more positive example; it also allows them to accomplish goals they have set for the season.
“I watched myself grow as a player and a leader throughout my time at CMU. I watch[ed] my team change and grow and it has been a really awesome and unique experience; this year our team was very close and united in our goal. Every season our goal is to make it [to the] NCAAs and to have fun doing it... and we made it happen,” said Donohue.
The experience Donohue has gained from playing on Carnegie Mellon’s team has been invaluable to her college experience.
Not only did she grow alongside the team through her four years, but she also experienced cities and events she otherwise would not have.
“I love the relationships I have gained being a part of the [CMU Volleyball] family. We win and lose together and are constantly ready to push each other to make each other better. I love going out to dinner after a big win and being surrounded by my favorite people,” said Donohue.
Without her team, Donohue would not be the same. The family that has come from playing volleyball and the leadership experience that has come from her position as co-captain are invaluable to her.
“The team has shown me what it takes to be a leading woman. My teammates... make me proud to be at an institution like CMU [and] have shown me how to have more confidence and work hard. I believe that being a part of this team has allowed me to unlock my potential at Carnegie Mellon; going through the challenges of CMU is way easier having a team at my back,” said Donohue.

Another week, another loss for me. My performance this year has been abysmal at best and this week was no different. With six teams out, attack of the bye week left most teams struggling to find points. However, some managed to rise above and turn their backup players into first-string points. Let’s take a look at how the week fared for The Tartan Fantasy League. 
Justin Tucker Must (not) Die over Drop it like it’s Crock 103.3–95.4
Despite Jacksonville Jaguars running back Leonard Fournette’s unexpected benching, contributing editor Lula Beresford still managed to pull out a win. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz definitely compensated for Fournette’s lack of points completing 15 of 27 passes for 199 yards. He also managed four touchdowns in Philadelphia’s 51–23 win over Denver. Carolina Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey also had a pretty solid performance rushing 15 times for 66 yards and catching five of six passes. With New Orleans Saints wide receiver Michael Thomas, Green Bay Packers wide receiver Davante Adams, and Washington Redskins tight end Vernon Davis all bringing in double-digit points, Beresford’s team finished with a solid lead over mine. Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott carried my team with two touchdowns, three carries, and 21 of 33 completed passes for a total of 26.7 points. My next highest scoring player, Panthers wide receiver Devin Funchess, came in at 13.6 points catching five of seven targets. I went into this week expecting to win, but my players had other plans.
Third–String Team over Easy Breesy 126.4–120.3
Well, this week the student has become the master with assistant sports editor Marika Yang beating sports editor Ian Tanaya. Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch finally did what Yang drafted him to do carrying 14 times for 57 yards and two touchdowns for a total of 20.3 points. Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce also performed well catching seven of nine targets and a touchdown for 20.3 points as well. Despite Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver A.J. Green only bringing in 1.6 points, Yang still pulled off the victory. Tanaya saw most of his points come from Denver Broncos wide receiver Demaryius Thomas.
Thomas caught eight of 12 targets for 70 yards resulting in 21 points. Even though all but one of his players earned double-digit points, it still wasn’t enough to overcome Yang’s team.
Yes We Cam over Team Andah 107.4–48.7
Editor–in–Chief India Price more than doubled staffwriter Josh Andah’s score this week. We get it Andah, you care little to none about fantasy football, but I had hoped that by now you would have at least changed your name to something more fun and creative. Andah barely had a playable team this week with three players on bye week, one on injury reserve, and another that was benched for a hamstring injury. Honestly, 48.7 points is a lot for him to have garnered with so few players. He can attribute this tiny victory to Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson’s 22 of 32 completed passes for 212 yards and two touchdowns for 23.6 points and wide receiver Doug Baldwin caught seven of 12 targets for 108 yards and a touchdown for 23.8 points. Andah’s lack of attention allowed Price to pull out a win despite scoring in the low 100s. Price saw an impressive performance from Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, as usual, completing 13 of 24 passes for 137 yards, nine rushes, and a touchdown for 20.1. Chiefs wide receiver Tyreek Hill also had a solid performance with a touchdown and two of four targets caught for a total of 15.3 points.
For week ten, I’m up against Andah, who has not made one adjustment to his line since draft day and I’m pretty sure has forgotten he’s a part of this so it won’t be as satisfying, but I should at least win since he’ll have two players on bye week. With many of Yang’s top scorers on bye week, I expect Price to easily overcome her team. As far as the matchup between Tanaya and Beresford, it seems a bit too close to call right now. While I know it’s far too late for me to do anything about my terrible losing streak, I’m looking forward to a victory in week ten. Although maybe I shouldn’t count my eggs before they hatch because the last time I faced off against Andah, he still won despite having two players on bye week. Stay tuned.

On homecoming weekend, the football team fell to the Case Western Reserve University Spartans at Gesling Stadium in the 32nd Annual Academic Bowl on Saturday. The 41–34 thriller was the second to go into overtime in the history of the matchup and the first in a decade.
The Carnegie Mellon offense took the ball for the first time after Case Western’s opening drive ended with a missed field goal. Senior quarterback Bryan Jangro took his first snap of the season for a 41-yard pass to first-year wide receiver Alex Oshita, quickly putting the Tartans in Spartans territory. Jangro hadn’t played in the season due to injuries and ended senior day with one completion on one attempt. Junior quarterback Alex Cline, the Tartans’ usual starter, played for the remainder of the game.
The Tartans finished the drive with a 34-yard field goal by punter and kicker Tyler Kohman, getting on the board first, 3–0.
In the next series, the Tartans defense limited the Spartans to short rushes and an incomplete pass to force a punt. Cline took the ball back for the Tartans and led the team down the field. The 5:45-long drive ended at the beginning of the second quarter with a 5-yard touchdown pass from Cline to senior wide receiver Tommy Mansfield. The score increased the Tartans’ lead to 10–0.
The Spartans responded on the ensuing drive by marching in Tartans territory and scoring their first points of the game, cutting Carnegie Mellon’s lead to 10–7. After a Tartans three-and-out, the Spartans evened the game with a field goal on a 50-second drive, making the score 10–10. The Tartans’ following drive was ended by an interception by Cline, and the Spartans offense took over deep in Tartans territory at the 17-yard line. They took advantage of the turnover on a quarterback run for a touchdown to take the lead 17–10.
The next two drives were similar; after another Cline interception, the Spartans started into Tartans territory to score, this time a field goal to extend their lead to 10 points, adding to a total of 20 unanswered points. Trailing 20–10, the Tartans used their three timeouts in the final two minutes of the half to steadily make their way down the field, capping off a 10-play, 78-yard drive with a second touchdown from Cline to Mansfield and cut the lead to three. The half ended with the visitors leading 20–17.
The Tartans came out of halftime hoping to play aggressively and put more points on the board. However, the scoreless third quarter was made up of seven total series that ended in either a punt of a turnover. The Spartans broke through the stalemate in the beginning of the fourth quarter with a touchdown pass, bringing their lead back to 10, the score now 27–17. The Tartans answered to make the score 27–24 with a two yard rushing touchdown by senior running back Sam Benger.
With two minutes left in the fourth quarter, the Tartans led 31–27 after an 11-yard rush from junior running back Rory Hubbard. With 22 seconds left, a Tartans punt was blocked and scooped up by Spartans special teams and returned for a touchdown. In two seconds, the Spartans were back in the lead, 34–31. A squib kick gave the Tartans the ball past midfield into Spartans territory. Kohman made a 43-yard field goal with two seconds left in regulation to tie the game, 34–34, sending the game into overtime.
The Spartans received the ball first in overtime and scored a touchdown to go ahead 41–34. On the Tartan’s drive, Cline threw a six yard pass to junior halfback Karl-Mark Kumm on fourth down to extend the game. Facing another fourth down, nine yards out from the end zone and four yards from the first down, Benger got the ball but was stopped two yards short of the first down, ending the game. Case Western won 41–34.
Cline finished the game 25-for-44, a career-high 331 yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions. Mansfield had a career-high 131 yards on nine receptions and added a touchdown. Senior wide receiver had 88 yards on four catches. Benger led the team in rushing with 119 yards on 29 carries and a touchdown, his 59th rushing touchdown of his Carnegie Mellon career, tying the school record.
On defense, senior linebacker Kyle Brittain made a career-high 19 tackles, 10 solo, and recovered a fumble. Senior linebacker Sean Graff also had a career day, with 11 tackles, four solo.
The football team finished its regular season with an overall record of 7–3, 5–3 in Presidents’ Athletic Conference (PAC) play, and 1–1 in University Athletic Association (UAA) play. The Tartans will learn on Monday, Nov. 13, at noon if they will continue their 2017 season in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) Division III Football Fest.

This weekend, Carnegie Mellon is playing host to the first and second rounds of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III women’s soccer playoffs. The Tartans, ranked number eight, started off the weekend with a game against the unranked Farmingdale State Rams. A strong showing from Carnegie Mellon helped propel them to a 1–0 win, launching them into the second round of the playoffs.
Carnegie Mellon started the game strong, monopolizing possession and getting off multiple shots on Farmingdale’s goalie. In the 23rd minute junior defender Emily Tolmer had an impressive header shot, but it went just high over the crossbar and missed the goal. Tolmer’s next shot, however, off a corner kick from senior Tori Iatarola in the 25th minute, deflected off the back of a Rams defender and directly to the feet of senior Haili Adams. Adams placed it perfectly over the goalie to give the Tartans a 1–0 lead. This was Adams’ team-leading 11th goal of the season.
The Tartans continued their heavy offensive push throughout the first half, but despite accumulating an impressive number of shots, they were unable to get another goal. Farmingdale State’s frustration became evident near the end of the first half, with two Rams players receiving yellow cards in the 42nd minute.
In the second half, Farmingdale State showed a bit more energy, and pushed more at Carnegie Mellon’s defense, testing first-year goalkeeper Carolyn Botz with four shots on goal, with the first shot of the game for the Rams coming in the 55th minute. In the 57th minute, Tolmer was handed a yellow card as well, but the team stayed focused. Farmingdale State had nine fouls in the second half to Carnegie Mellon’s seven. However, despite strong chances on both sides, neither team was able to score in the final minutes, and Carnegie Mellon advanced to the second round of the playoffs.
The game was full of fouls on both sides, with the Rams whistled 19 times and the Tartans 13. Botz made four saves for her twelfth shutout of the season and first of the postseason. Farmingdale State goalie Daniella Ford made eight saves on nine shots.
Thanks to the win, the Tartans advanced to the next round against the unranked Arcadia College Knights on Sunday, Nov. 12. More details on the results of Sunday’s game can be found at thetartan.org/2017/11/13/sports.

As the calendar winds into the last months of 2017, the temperature goes down, and the excitement goes up — because it’s basketball season, Tartan fans! Let’s take a look at some big names and some big games to watch for this upcoming season.
Women’s
Last season’s Tartans went an impressive 21–7 in the 2016-17 season, but coming into this season the team has suffered big losses in the offensive department with the graduation of seniors Lisa Murphy and Jackie Hudepohl. The team will be looking to every player on the team to fill the gaps in offense this season.
Look for junior guard Jenn Mayberger to be a big playmaker this year. During her first year, she set a school record for most assists (142), and in 2016-17, she led the team again, finishing with a more modest, but still impressive 97.
Also keep an eye on sophomore forward Katharine Higgins and sophomore guard Makayla Filiere to make big shots from the three-point line. Higgins and Filiere went 1–2 on three-point baskets last season, and will likely continue their production as sharpshooters from outside the white line.
Conference play for the Tartans starts Jan. 6, when the team takes on Case Western Reserve University. This should be an interesting test for the team, as they split their games with Case Western last season. Look out for that home opener on Jan. 19, when the Tartans look to bounce back from a 0–2 skid against the Chicago Maroons.
Men’s
Last season, the Tartans went 14–12. Not their best season, to be sure, and, similar to the women’s team, big veteran losses in leading scorers Jack Serbin and Chris Shkil aren’t going to do them any favors. Hopefully this year’s considerably younger team can pick up the slack. Eyes will certainly be on senior guard Ryan Maha, who was third in points-per-game last season, and junior forward and guard Seth Henry, who finished third in assists in 2016-17, to make a big impact and lead the team.
Make sure you watch for sophomore guard Zach Howarth, who had an incredible first year, scoring 170 points, the fourth most on the team. He’ll be looking to avoid a sophomore slump and continue to help his team on the offensive end.
Junior forward and center Patrick Ehland will be hard to miss in the pint, towering on the court 6’8”. Look for him to make a big defensive contribution, as he finished third in blocks, and fourth in rebounds last season.
Men’s conference play also starts Jan. 6 against Case Western. The Tartans defeated the Spartans twice last season, and hope to continue the win streak into this year. Be sure to stick around Skibo on Friday, Jan. 19, as the men take on the Maroons in their conference home opener. The Tartan men also have a two-game winning streak on their side against the Maroons, so look for a few more big wins this season.

IBM announces testing phase of 50 qubit computer
As companies race against each other to launch the first commercially available quantum computer in the market, IBM has announced the testing phase of a 50 qubit computer. This number is especially important because not only in the largest one to be announced, it is also the first to actually put forward the possibility for quantum computers to be able to perform tasks that traditional computers cannot. IBM announced this prototype testing phase on Nov. 10.
Quantum computers use a principle called quantum superposition that allows the quantum bits or qubits to have states that are in-between the traditional binary of 1 or 0. This means that they can perform certain tasks better, but also means that they are more finicky and unpredictable, which makes it harder to have a greater number of processors.
Google is currently testing a 22 qubit computer, and is in the process of designing a larger one. IBM is also testing a 17 qubit one that it hopes to make commercially available by the end of 2017.

U.S. is only country to not sign Paris Climate Agreement
Syria officially signed the Paris Climate Change Agreement on Nov. 7. This comes after Nicaragua’s announcement to sign the accord in October. The U.S. is now the only country to not have signed the official agreement. Trump announced in a rose garden speech that the deal was bad for America’s economy and that he would quit the deal.
The Paris Climate Change Agreement, struck in 2015 brings together 200 countries in a pact to reduce their carbon footprint and green house gas emissions. Specifically, the agreement’s goal is for its members to take steps to ensure that this century’s average global temperatures rise by no more than 2 degrees Celsius. It is one of the first such agreements of its kind.
Under the official rules of the agreement, the US can’t withdraw until 2020, but then, U.S. officials haven’t really stated what parts of the agreement could be renegotiated. This means that it would be easy for a president elected in 2020 to cancel the withdrawal.

SpaceX engine explodes during qualification test
Earlier this week, one of SpaceX’s rocket engines exploded while qualification testing in the company’s testing facility located in McGregor, TX. 
The company confirmed this on Wednesday and is currently investigating the causes of this unfortunate event. This engine was intended to be used for a 2018 testing of a Falcon 9. No one was injured during this test.
This explosion comes after another one of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets exploded on a launching pad as it was being fueled before an engine test fire in September 2016. Another explosion occurred in 2015, when another Falcon 9 exploded while taking off en-route from Cape Canaveral to deliver cargo to the International Space Station. No people were hurt in both situations.
This failure comes after a very successful year for SapceX. They have doubled the number of launches per year, with 16 successful launches this year alone.

Leafhopper bugs camouflage their eggs by covering them with microparticles that deflect light, researchers announced this month.
Leafhoppers (scientifically, Cicadellidae) are small, bendy-kneed insects whose diet of plant sap makes them common garden pests. There are about 22,000 known species of leafhopper, and most of them produce particles called brochosomes — tiny spheres a few micrometers in diameter, with indentations all over them like the dimples on a golf ball. 
The brochosomes are secreted in a substance that the insects rub on their skin to make themselves waterproof. Leafhoppers also rub the substance on their eggs — and until recently, no one knew why.
When engineering researchers at Penn State University made some brochosomes in the lab using a novel nanomanufacturing process, they discovered that the shape and structure of the brochosomes prevent light from being reflected in any direction. The light that hits the brochosomes is completely absorbed. Because of the indentations on the brochosomes, the angle the light is coming from makes no difference. 
This effect helps leafhoppers hide their eggs from predators — the light-absorbing properties of the brochosomes make the eggs look just like the leaf they’re sitting on. The Penn State w confirmed this in two ways: first by analyzing the geometric properties of the brochosomes, and then by looking at brochosomes and various leaf species with a program that simulated ladybug vision.
These investigations of the brochosomes revealed “a performance that is comparable to the state-of-the-art synthetic antireflective coatings,” according to the researchers. Highly intrigued, they did further experiments on their synthetic brochosomes and found that the least light was reflected by brochosomes with the greatest amount of indentations per surface area. They also found the optimal ratio of indentation depth to indentation diameter for reflecting as little light as possible. 
These findings will likely be used to improve technology with components that need to absorb as much light as possible — for example, devices that harvest solar energy.

Certain species of water striders grow fans on their legs, allowing them to navigate habitats that other water striders cannot.
You may have seen water striders skating around on a calm pond or lake, making tiny ripples in the water’s surface. Water striders, also known as pond skaters or Jesus bugs, are semi-aquatic insects whose long legs allow them to distribute their body weight wide enough to balance on top of water without breaking the surface tension. Their legs are covered with microscopic hairs, which prevent them from getting wet and therefore weighed down, and trap tiny air bubbles under their feet, allowing them to actively repel the water beneath.
In addition to the hairs, some water striders grow feathery fans on the middle pair of their six legs. There are over 2,000 kinds of water striders, but only one genus — Rhagovelia — grows the fluffy fans. Unlike the hairs, the function of these fans is a mystery. This mystery captivated biologist Abderrahman Khila, who filled his lab with aquariums containing dozens of different water strider species in order to study them.
Khila, who researches at the University of Lyon in France, first speculated that the leg fans might give extra support to the hairy legs on Rhagovelia, allowing them to grow bigger while maintaining their ability to stay on top of the water. However, Rhagovelia are smaller than some other types of water strider that lack the leg fans. (Water striders in Southeast Asia can have legspans the diameter of CDs.)
The fans also didn’t appear to give Rhagovelia an edge in their fiercely competitive lives. Water striders often engage in violent feeding frenzies and exhibit cannibalistic tendencies. “In the lab, they eat each other all the time,” Khila explains. Most cannibalized water striders are attacked just after molting, when they are no longer shielded by a protective exoskeleton. 
To solve the mystery of the fans, Khila examined the other trait that sets Rhagovelia apart from other water striders: their ability to make quick changes in direction and stay atop the water’s surface even when the water is fast-flowing. In some Rhagovelia specimens, Khila and his colleagues suppressed the genes that caused the fans to grow; for others, they removed parts of the fans. The mutated Rhagovelia were no better at making quick turns and navigating fast currents than other species of water strider that naturally lack the leg fans.
Khila considers the leg fan trait “one of those examples of key evolutionary innovations” that “just pop up” and turn out to be highly beneficial to a species. The emergence of this trait allowed Rhagovelia to literally explore new territory: to move from ponds and lakes to fast-flowing streams.
The results of the water strider experiments were published last month in Science.

“In order to do good economics, you have to keep in mind that people are human,” said Richard Thaler, the winner of this year’s Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences according to an article in The New York Times. That sentence quite succinctly describes what lies at the heart of behavioral economics.
Behavioral economics is the interdisciplinary study of the effect of people’s emotional and psychological state on economic activity. People’s responses to events, stimuli, and other influential factors is one of the hardest things to understand and rationally predict but it often has the largest impact on economic activity. Not everyone always acts purely rationally and in their own best interests. This is where behavioral economics comes in and tries to find the ways in which people are “predictably irrational” and understanding the conflicts that arise between human beings and rationality.
Behavioral economics at Carnegie Mellon was co-founded by Herbert Simon, winner of the 1978 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics and current faculty member George Loewenstein, a Herbert A. Simon University Professor of Economics and Psychology at Carnegie Mellon University and co-director of the Center for Behavioral Decision Research at CMU. He has also founded the field of neuroeconomics.
Although, the field of behavioral economics is relatively new, it promises a lot in terms of the large-scale impact it can have. Behavioral economists at Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences at Carnegie Mellon, are doing cutting-edge research — understanding and solving some of the most difficult and most complex problems such as rising healthcare costs, workplace discrimination, information interpretation biases etc. “At Carnegie Mellon, we’re looking at problems that matter to the world and trying to understand the issues and why they happen, but also how to change them,” said Linda Babcock, the James M. Walton Professor of Economics. She is also the head of the Department of Social and Decision Sciences in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences at Carnegie Mellon. She further explains in a CMU press release that, “our brand of behavioral economics is much more mixed — about 50 percent economics and 50 percent psychology — than anywhere else. And it’s not just that we have economists and psychologists. The economists know a lot of psychology and the psychologists know a lot of economics,” Furthermore, the department also deploys a Research truck, as shown in the aabove photo, that allows researchers to collect data that is representative of a population, by moving around different locations.
CMU Researchers Saurabh Bhargava and Loewenstein have improved healthcare plans to be more easy-to-understand, cut costs and poor decision-making. The bestselling book, Women Don’t Ask: The High Cost of Avoiding Negotiation and Positive Strategies for Change, coauthored by Babcock and Sara Laschever, a founding member of the Heinz College Negotiation Academy for Women, explains negotiation techniques to combat workplace discrimination. Another project, called Seventeen Days, promotes awareness about sexual health and teenage pregnancy, as opposed to abstinence-based sex-ed, and helps reduce the risk of venereal disease and unwanted pregnancies. This is indeed, work that matters.

Some love her, others hate her, but nobody can deny that Taylor Swift is one of the most influential singer-songwriters and pop stars of the 21st century. With all of her previous five albums having over four million sales each in the U.S. alone, and with over 104 million and 85 million followers on Instagram and Twitter respectively, Swift has a huge presence around the globe. So when the content on all her social media accounts was removed in mid-August, people were in a frenzy trying to find out why. The answer was simple: Reputation.
Last Friday, Swift’s sixth album, Reputation, came out. While I initially had no plans of picking it up, curiosity won out over my cynicism, and I was not ready for what Reputation had in store. Although she claims in her new track “End Game (feat. Ed Sheeran and Future),” that “I don’t love the drama, it loves me,” throughout the years many have questioned Swift’s true intentions and thought she merely donned a good girl persona for her own gain. While I’m not going to go into that debate, she is still one of the most well known and popular music artists, and the messages she sends through her actions, words, and lyrics matter, especially with an audience predominantly comprised of adolescent females.
In her new album, Swift reinvents herself and her music. She has always been pretty experimental with each new album, especially with Red and 1989 finally transitioning her fully out of country and into the pop genre. However, Reputation is by far the most extreme and drastic change, not only to her sound but her image and whole persona. She has in some ways embraced her dark and less innocent side, and it seems to have worked out in her favor.
Swift’s first track on the album is “…Ready for It?” Although I initially hated it, after listening several more times, I have grown to appreciate the creative blend of sounds and musical styles throughout the song. However, Swift’s rapping will never cease to be cringe worthy for me. She seems to be trying too hard to make it work, and it just doesn’t. The lyrics are good, but the execution is subpar. Although the flow of her rap is a bit questionable, it does manage to balance out with the lyrics and beautiful vocals in the chorus, and she surprisingly weaved them in well throughout the electronic and rap elements to produce a pretty decent song.
This blend of genres continues in many of the other tracks in the album, including “King of My Heart” and the mildly underwhelming collaboration with Ed Sheeran and Future, “End Game.” She not only blends genres and stretches her musical limits in the album, but also evokes other popular artists in her songs as well, such as Halsey. Her versatility in the album does not stop with genre, however. The themes of her songs in this album encompass many different fields, including the obvious topic of reputation, but also the struggles of dealing with crushes and new loves, all the different stages of romantic relationships, backstabbing, and making mistakes. Swift in Reputation is by far the most multi-faceted Taylor Swift yet.
While “End Game” was not stylistically a favorite from the album, the message is clear. Despite having a horrible record and reputation with romance, Swift sings about wanting long-term love and no drama. Due to her position in the spotlight, though, it is much harder to overcome mistakes and form those lasting relationships. This theme continues in “Dress,” with Swift singing about not only a physically intimate relationship, but also an emotional one where “even in [her] worst times, [he] could see the best of [her]” and “even in [her] worst lies, [he] saw the truth in [her],” as well as her final, most soulful track on the album, “New Year’s Day,” a sweet ballad where she expresses similar sentiments about being there at her love’s highest of highs and lowest of lows.
Swift also covers other areas in the romance department in her songs, not only covering lasting love but also doomed love in the emotional story in “Getaway Car” that is reminiscent of songs from Swift’s previous albums, Red and 1989, as well as the beginning stages of romance in “Delicate” and “Gorgeous.” Both “Delicate” and “Gorgeous” consist of very simplistic lyrics, but the words ring true and are relatable to anyone who has met someone but has no idea how to handle the situation, either due to awkwardness or uncertainty when it comes to pace, or because of other variables like pre-existing relationships or being too attractive. “Gorgeous” in particular is super bouncy and fun, with the perfect sound effects and background music with the vocals, throwing back a bit to the “old Taylor” that Swift claims died, reminding me a tiny bit of her Fearless classic “You Belong with Me” and Carly Rae Jepsen’s 2012 hit, “Call Me Maybe.”
Although there are a couple songs about Swift’s backstabbers, such as “Look What You Made Me Do” and “This is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things,” both songs are catchy and take very different approaches to dealing with the same problem, likely Kanye West. In “Look What You Made Me Do,” she uses her past experiences to strengthen herself and move up, while “This is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things” is an extremely fun track that twists something seemingly sweet and innocent into something complex and somewhat vengeful. This complexity and an almost oxymoronic contrast between lyrics and style make “This is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things” one of my favorite tracks from Reputation.
Despite still being skeptical after my first run through of the songs, the more I listened to the songs from Reputation, the better they got. Although the choruses of most of the songs were overly repetitive and took away from the songs’ fullest potential, Swift showed a new side of herself in Reputation. It may take some getting used to, but should be welcomed and appreciated for what it’s worth.

List off as many Asian-American stars in Hollywood as you can. Most likely, you won’t use all ten of your fingers. You might not even use five. This is how YouTuber, actress, filmmaker, and owner of six cats Anna Akana started her lecture, sponsored by the Pitt Asian Students Alliance, on Asians in the entertainment industry, which took place at University of Pittsburgh’s William Pitt Union Friday November 10 at 6 p.m. Attracting not only Pitt students but Carnegie Mellon students and fans of her work, Anna Akana’s lecture was entertaining and insightful but also impactful, inspiring, and surprisingly personal in how she communicated, in how others responded to her, and in how I even felt about her.
After introducing herself, her YouTube channel, and her six (yes, six) cats, Akana talked about the lack of Asians in entertainment by breaking down the problem into a few main categories regarding their representation, such as yellowface, whitewashing, racial era- sure, and stereotyping. While most of her lecture focused on issues I had heard about before, she incorporated a lot of her own per- sonal stories to further highlight the issue and its seriousness. She discussed a few stories featured in her book, So Much I Want to Tell You, but still made everything she told fresh, new, and interest- ing. She also made the solutions that she advocated for — support- ing other works by Asian creators, speaking out on social media — appealing, emboldening people with the confidence to follow her advice and stand up in the greater public sphere for Asian repre- sentation. I was still incredibly excited about what she would say and what to expect; for the first time, I was hearing someone talk about the kind of issues that I felt strongly and passionately about, and I couldn’t wait to hear about a perspective on these issues other than my own.
What truly spoke about the lecture and her character, however, was her interaction with the audience and the Q&A portion of her lecture. At the start of her lecture, she asked if anyone in the audience was considering a career in entertainment. Out of the 200 people in the room, with 90% being Asian, three people raised their hands.  She responded saying, “This lecture is for you,” starting her talk off on a personal and intimate vibe by helping to give these three people a perspective on the industry they wanted to work in. She also extended her Q&A portion by a few minutes, taking the time to candidly answer the audience’s questions about her own perspective on the industry, her personal experiences, and her six cats. She’d often have conversations with them too, making her only more open, lovely, relatable, and an amazing role model to the audience around her.
I’d gone through most of my high school career watching a lot of vloggers on YouTube. While I thought classic stars such as Tyler Oakley, Dan Howell and Phil Lester, John Green, and Grace Helbig were just hilarious people, I had never connected with some- one so instantly and personally as when I watched Anna Akana’s “Why Girls Should Ask Guys Out” in September, a week after getting rejected. Still feeling sour about my love life, I poured over more of her videos and instantly cheered up in finding a kindred spirit, regretting not fully discovering her earlier, but knowing that I wouldn’t have appreciated her then as much as I do now. In “I’ve Made a Horrible Mistake,” she said things I agreed with about regrets that I could never follow, and gave me the confidence to use that time I spent regretting things to do more. In “Can I be happy single?”, she encouraged me that being single gave me more of a chance to discover more about myself, and helped me to just live my life in the moment. In all her countless videos about Asian stereotypes, Asians in the media, and her one-off jokes blast- ing whitewashing, she gave me a greater self-confidence to speak up more on this issue I strongly believed in. She was charming, funny, and most importantly, I saw myself in her. Thankfully, these were things that all resonated and remained true Friday night.
In just two months, Anna Akana helped me get in touch with who I am as a young Asian-American adult woman. In each of her four- minute videos, I see myself nearly going into her situations, and her telling me what to do and what not to do. I see a common shared experience that goes beyond personality, and just beyond race. And last Friday, so did nearly 200 other young Asian adults. In her lecture and each of her 188 videos on her YouTube channel, Anna Akana never fails to be a reminder of why representation is important.

Hey Ruth,
So Thanksgiving Break is coming up (and after that winter break!) which means holidays, holidays, and more holidays. I can’t explain to you how excited I am for even one home cooked meal, and now I’ve got course after course of delicious holiday food coming my way. 
I’m so hype to chow down and chill out, but I’m a little anxious about having to see my relatives. Don’t get me wrong, I love them, and I’m super excited to get to see them since it’s been so long, but every time I do they ask me what I’m doing at school and I. Don’t. Know. What. To. Say. It’s easy to assume that everyone here knows what I mean when I say I’m in 112 but no one in my family understands the nuance! “How’s school” is up there on my list of impossible questions with “are you dating anyone” when I’m not and “what are your plans for the future” when I don’t have any. 
Too Many Inquiries
Dear TMI,
I am notorious among my friends for having an impossible to explain major. When I first started here I was the absolute worst at explaining what I was doing — thanks a lot, orientation week —
but over the years I’ve picked up a few tricks to explain what you do at CMU to people who have no idea.
Basically, you want an elevator pitch. Sit down for roughly 20 minutes (maybe on the trip home) and figure out the best way to explain what you do in layman’s terms. Eliminate that jargon. It doesn’t have to cover every single niche aspect of your thing — and honestly, probably shouldn’t — but the more complete an explanation is, the sooner you won’t have to talk about it anymore. Add some examples of projects you’ve worked on, even if technically they were for a class, and you should be mostly set.
If you know that someone in your family has a more in-depth understanding of your field than other members, I’d also recommend preparing a variation on your basic spiel for them. Though, if you mostly know what you’re talking about you should be fine in winging it for someone else who knows what you’re talking about.
Still, it’s good practice for that 30-second pitch every single career guidance person ever says you should have. (You should probably have one of those. At least by graduation.)
Basically, pick the thing you’re most excited about and interested in, because you’ll be less annoyed when repeatedly talking about it, and try to resist the urge to answer “how’s school” with “terrible and full of tears.” No one wants to hear that.
As for those other impossible questions? “Nope!” and a change of subject should be an acceptable answer to “are you dating anyone?” If it’s not, pick “Nope! I’m enjoying hanging out with my friends” or “Nope! Everyone on campus is disgusting and obsessed with these stupid stones” depending on how you’re feeling.
The future plans answer changes depending on how close you are to graduation, but pick a point on the sliding scale between “I want to see where my program leads me” to “I want to see who will pay me enough to eat.” Or maybe “I’m thinking of applying to these places that people have heard of and we’ll see when I start getting responses.”
Good luck,
Ruth

While Sinead continued on with her well-deserved break this week, I gathered up a different group of buddies and scoured the internet for a new bar to try. On a chilly Friday night, we decided that a bar called Mixtape would provide the perfect way to kick off Founder’s weekend.
The location: Mixtape is located on Penn Avenue right on the border of the hip neighborhoods Bloomfield and Garfield. Across the street is an art gallery, and down the block are a number of other bars and restaurants. The area feels like the type to be more likely inhabited by young urban professionals than your grandparents. Mixtape is a bit far from campus, so I’d recommend calling an Uber or Lyft, but the 64 bus will eventually get you there.
The drinks: Mixtape’s drinks menu is very cute, peppered with punny music-related drink names (“Major Tom” and “Avril LaGreen,” to name a couple). The drinks seem to be on the pricey side at first glance with $8-10 a cocktail, but a sign at the front of the bar states, “Please, No Tipping: We pay our employees for you. All items are priced accordingly in order to provide consistent living wages and paid sick days for all staff,” so the cost ends up roughly being the same as if you’d bought cheap drinks and tipped the bartender.
In terms of taste, the drinks are kind of mediocre. I ordered the “Tonight, Tonight” cocktail, which is an autumnal bourbon-based drink. Theoretically, the drink contains some apple cider, but the primary flavor I could taste was alcohol, with cinnamon as a close second. Perhaps I would have faired better with something else.
My friend’s drink, a cocktail called “Hot and Dangerous,” was a bit better. Her drink was unusual, fruity with a slightly spicy kick. Also, the “Hot and Dangerous” is prepared with a blowtorch, so that was pretty cool (or, one might say, “lit”).
The vibe: This bar gives off a chill, vintage hipster vibe. There are probably more bean bag chairs than actual chairs at Mixtape, and there are various board games throughout the room.
Additionally, Warhol-esque pop art drawings of various popular culture icons from the ‘80s and ‘90s ranging from Molly Ringwald to Outkast line the walls. In addition to the no tipping sign, Mixtape proclaims its liberal management with another sign in support of the LGBTQ and refugee communities.
At 9 p.m. on a Friday night, Mixtape is packed, with a person in every beanbag chair and a long line for drinks, but the atmosphere is nonetheless relaxed. From the cozy beanbag chairs to the warm staff, the Mixtape vibe almost feels more like that of a coffee shop than that of a bar.
Lit or Nah: I’m gonna go ahead and say Mixtape is lit. Although the drinks we tried left something to be desired, Mixtape’s atmosphere is pleasing.
This bar is a great place to come with a friend or two to relax in a beanbag chair, play a game of connect four, and catch up on each other’s lives, and it seems that Carnegie Mellon students would agree, as we saw a few enjoying themselves there already.

Audre Lorde wrote, “History is not kind to us / we restitch it with the living / past memory forward / into desire / into the panic articulation.”
Queer women don’t get to grow up seeing their own history, and so they don’t find validation and inspiration in those like them. In the summer of 2015, Hayley Kiyoko released the music video for “Girls like Girls.” For me, this was one of my first introductions to the possibility of queerness and fantasy. That same year, the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in the United States. In the context of this sweeping social change, the music of artists like Hayley Kiyoko, Kehlani, and Halsey created spaces in pop music for girls to explore this idea of fantasy and self for those who couldn’t relate to the dominant brands of heterosexual feminine fantasy like Taylor Swift or Ed Sheeran.
Since 2015, the political landscape has of course changed, with Trump quoted saying that Mike Pence wanted to “hang them all” in reference to gay rights and Betsy DeVos rolling back the Obama administration’s protections of LGBTQ students. In the face of policies driven by ignorance and hate, queer artists have refused to be silenced and are claiming their spaces with greater confidence.
It was from this mindset that Summer Leavitt began the work for her solo show We have a future, perhaps at The Frame gallery. After the election, she began to wrestle with her identity as a lesbian artist in the context of Trump’s America. She spent the year working with her own experiences and memory to use her work as an artist to immortalize a piece of queer history. In her statement, Leavitt quotes Ann Cvetkovich: “In the absence of institutionalized documentation or in opposition to official histories, memory becomes a valuable historical resource, and ephemeral and personal collections of objects stand alongside the documents of the dominant culture in order to offer alternative modes of knowledge.”
And so, this show is about memory and nostalgia. Entering the gallery space, you are hit with the smell of soft perfumes and musk. The show is carefully curated, with minimalistic swatches of colors and intentionally placed pieces, intended to evoke all the senses with cola flavored lollipops and tactile paintings and performances. The gallery is colored like Valentine’s Day, with a palette of pinks, reds, blacks, and purples. Leavitt herself pulls together this palette, clad together on a opening day in a bright red suit with matching lipstick.
This is fitting, perhaps, as this show is about working with performance. Her piece “Untitled (Wish You Were Here)” presents ongoing project where she exchanges a postcard with lipstick kisses with a lover. The back room holds a video piece entitled “The Mannish Strut of a Particularly Confident Woman.” Her work plays with the memories of self, lovers, and love.
On opposite ends of the room are paintings that draw from the era of Rothko and Pollock, artists who once represented pure American masculinity. Leavitt has used these beautiful gradient pieces as self-portraiture, the first “Untitled (Spring, 2015, Mixing Fluids and Dreaming, Ad Nauseum)” reflects on a relationship she had with a woman during her time in Paris, whose perfume she would wear when she woke up with her every day. The painting is layers and layers of scent, trying to preserve the memory of this relationship by recreating her partner’s perfume.
On the opposite side of the room is a soft blush painting, made from canvas dyed with red wine, entitled “Untitled (Love Potion No. 3).” Leavitt talked about how she wears perfume and lipstick every day, so the presence of these materials in her work was essential to her work with selfportraiture. The perfumes in this piece, in contrast to her first painting, is layered perfume and essential oils that she wears every day. This piece then emphasizes the question of self and immortalizes a routine vignette of her life.
In this way, the show is romantic, nostalgic, and longing. And as much as it is a beautiful glimpse into this intimate memory of the artist, the show is also conscious of the power to turn artists into cultural icons. At the same time as I was trying to understand the private world these pieces evoked, these performances and stories also allowed me to imagine more vividly the way my queerness could add richness to my own life — in terms of experiencing love as well as in confidence and exploration of the self.
Art history is filled to the brim with male fantasy, and it is so exciting to see artist such as Summer Leavitt explore the possibilities of fantasy and memory in the context of femininity and queerness. With the continued absence of queer history, it is still novel and invigorating to see gay women living vibrant, exciting, and complicated lives.
Art is about finding greater complexity in the world, the spaces and lives we could not previously explore. And so, for its tender and confident moments through the expertise of medium, I recommend seeing this show before it closes on Nov. 20.

Have you ever considered what goes through your mind the moment you meet someone new? How much does someone’s physical appearance influence your impression of them when compared to their personality? The Ellis Gallery exhibit, Dine in the Dark: a Dinner pARTy, allowed visitors to explore those questions.
Dine in the Dark, displayed from Nov. 7 to Nov. 10, was a project created by seniors Nick Boston, philosophy major; Sarah Stinson-Hurwitz, gender studies and art BHA; Faith Kaufman, design major; and junior Daniel See, decision science and art BHA, the same Carnegie Mellon students who put together The Holiday dinner party last month. That event, as well as this month’s Dine in the Dark, is a part of the students’ Dinner pARTy series, for which they host a “dinner party” event every month to bring together people from various backgrounds on campus.
The focus of the Dine in the Dark exhibit was to present the outcomes of an event they recently organized, in which ten people from the Carnegie Mellon community were randomly picked to have dinner with one another. What made this particular dinner unique was that everyone was blindfolded, and their identities had to remain anonymous until the end of the event. The guest list included three undergraduates, two graduate students, two campus police officers, two faculty members, and one staff member. Throughout the dinner, the guests were asked several questions that helped facilitate a fruitful discussion and to also allow everyone to get to know one another on a more personal level.
When I stepped into the Ellis Gallery, the first thing I noticed was the recording of the guests’ responses to the questions that played all throughout the room. Hearing their voices as I walked around the exhibit made it feel as though I was present at the dinner. There was a long table at the center of the room that had dinner plates and utensils all set. Even though all the seats were empty, I could still easily imagine all the guests at the table.
Hand-drawn self-portraits of each of the attendees were hung up on the wall, and beside each portrait was a diagram that presented where they sat at the table. Some of the questions asked during the event were also displayed in the exhibit, along with the written responses of several of the guests. The questions were very random, but they gave guests the opportunity to reflect on their personal beliefs, decisions, and approaches to certain situations; an example of a question being, “What would you do if you had 24 hours left to live?” Visitors were even able to contribute to the dinner conversation by writing down answers to the questions on sticky notes and posting them on the wall. The entire interactive design of the exhibit was very well done, and it allowed visitors to experience the dinner party for themselves.
I attended The Holiday dinner party last month, and the main difference between my experience during that event and my visit to the Dine in the Dark exhibit was the people I was surrounded by. I was able to physically be around and mingle with so many different people during last month’s event compared to this month’s exhibit, which I visited by myself and was the only person physically present in the room at the time.
What surprised me, however, was that I did not feel so alone when I was in the exhibit. Listening to the voices of the guests speak, viewing their creative self-portraits on the wall, and reading their very personal and relatable responses as well as others’ to the conversation questions, allowed me to create and attend my own version of that dinner party. It was truly fascinating that I was able to form a connection with the people who attended the event and/or visited the exhibit when I had never met them in person. The Dine in the Dark project helped me understand that physical appearance (and presence in my case) is not essential to forming relationships with new people.

Students registered to vote in Pennsylvania cast their ballots this past Tuesday in the Connan room for local and statewide offices, as well as two Pennsylvania ballot measures. Though local Democrats fared well, Republicans made gains in some statewide races.
One such gain was the victory of Republican Sallie Mundy, interim Supreme Court Justice to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, over Democrat and former Steeler Dwayne Woodruff in the highest statewide seat up for election following an email porn scandal that led to the resignation of two Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justices. Justice Mundy marketed both her bipartisan respect, as she had been appointed interim justice by Democratic Governor Tom Wolf, and funded late-launching attack ads against her opponent, whom she had decisively out-fundraised.
Though Justice Mundy’s margin of victory was under five percent, it represented the widest margin in this year’s statewide judicial elections in what might portend an increasingly purple state. She was behind, however, by 27 percentage points in Allegheny County. Democrats retain control of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which recently decided to fast-track a political gerrymandering case, and which continuously makes decisions that impact the lives of people all over Pennsylvania.
Pittsburgh maintained its status as a deeply blue city, with Mayor Bill Peduto running unopposed and easily securing re-election. Peduto recently garnered national attention in his response to President Trump’s claim that his administration was working for “Pittsburgh, not Paris.” He spent a year studying at Carnegie Mellon University and worked with the university in 2016 to launch Pittsburgh’s Smart City Application. Sheriff Bill Mullen, a Democrat, was also re-elected.
Democrats also experienced some unanticipated gains in races such as the Allegheny County Council, with Democrat Anita Prizio beating out Republican incumbent Ed Kress. In the three other County Council races where candidates were running unopposed, all of the incumbents held onto their seats, with both Democrats beating their opponents by a margin of over ten points, and Republican Tom Baker, who represents County Council district one, winning by less than one point.
Both referenda on the ballot were approved as well, with voters overwhelmingly choosing to amend Pittsburgh’s home-rule charter to allow city employees to take side jobs at schools. The statewide amendment to Pennsylvania’s constitution that would allow legislatures to vote to allow taxing entities to exempt primary residents from property taxes was also passed. Allegheny County voted against it by a slim margin.
Though local elections proved  to trend largely Democratic, results such as the election of Justice Mundy showed that statewide races can prove highly competitive.
Voter turnout was around 23 percent, down from 2015 where around 26 percent of registered voters cast ballots in the last non-presidential or midterm election year. Allegheny County also did not officially hand out “I voted” stickers, instead opting to give voters receipts that state the date and their voter number, and are much less fun.
More data about turnout and further results from the elections can be found at http://www.alleghenycounty.us/elections/election-results.aspx.

Michael Trick, the Harry B. and James H. Higgins Professor of Operations Research, was officially welcomed as the new dean for Carnegie Mellon University’s Qatar campus. Trick, the third dean of Carnegie Mellon Qatar since it opened in 2004, will succeed Ilker Baybars, who stepped down at the end of the 2016-17 academic year after serving the role for the last six years.
Trick has been a member of Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business since 1989 where he served numerous leadership positions including senior associate dean for faculty and research. Over the past 25 years, Trick has mentored and supported faculty and student researchers, advanced strategic initiatives, overseen the promotion and tenure process, and elevated the research reputation of our top-ranked business school, according to a Tepper press release congratulating Trick on his new appointment.
Trick holds a Ph.D. in industrial engineering and has done research in the field of operations research, with a specialization in computational methods in optimization. He has written more than 50 professional publications and was the editor of six volumes of refereed articles.
“I am honored to be named dean of this remarkable institution,” Trick said in a university press release. “University is a transformative time for young people, and I look forward to building an educational experience at [Carnegie Mellon Qatar] that is enriching, enlightening and inspiring.”
Several Carnegie Mellon University faculty members were present at the ceremony to celebrate Trick’s new position, including Interim President Farnam Jahanian.
“Carnegie Mellon is proud to be a part of this community to deliver educational and research programs that will support and contribute to the long-term development of Qatar’s knowledge-based economy,” said Jahanian. “The leader we have chosen to build on this success is Michael Trick. Under Dean Trick’s leadership, I am confident that [Carnegie Mellon Qatar] will continue its development as an integral part of the Qatar landscape, representing CMU’s dynamic global capacity.”
Also present was Interim Provost Laurie Weingart who applauded Trick’s “long-standing commitment to a nurturing research and learning environment.”
“His commitment is driven by excellence and his belief in the power of collaboration to motivate and inspire others. These are values that will serve him well in this role,” she said.

Behavioral economics is being widely used by companies, organizations, and even governments because of how it revolutionizes the way we make decisions, changes the way organizations operate, and influences how policies are implemented. People with knowledge of behavioral economics are thus highly sought after by companies searching for smartly designed behavioral interventions.
At Carnegie Mellon University, behavioral economists use this unique blend of economics and psychology to solve pressing issues from rising health care costs and workplace discrimination to climate change and “fake news.”
“At Carnegie Mellon, we’re looking at problems that matter to the world and trying to understand the issues and why they happen, but also how to change them,” said Linda Babcock, the James M. Walton Professor of Economics and head of the Department of Social and Decision Sciences in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences.
This innovative branch of knowledge began at Carnegie Mellon with the late Herbert Simon, a Nobel laureate in economics, and current faculty member George Loewenstein, a co-founder of the field.
“One thing that is unusual about the research happening in our department is that it tends to be a really nice mix of both basic and applied research,” said Loewenstein, the Herbert A. Simon University Professor of Economics and Psychology, in a university press release. “For example, we have projects on topics like health insurance, take-up of government benefits and how to increase savings. But we also have a lot of basic research dealing with issues like how and why people avoid information and topics like curiosity, boredom, and discrimination.”
The fusion of economics and psychology addresses how problems can not only be solved through cost-effective methods but also how they can be solved with the greatest societal impact. Some projects which Carnegie Mellon University behavioral economists have designed include simplified health insurance plans to save people time and money, methods to teach women how to negotiate, and creating interactive tools for teenagers to prevent sexually transmitted infections and reduce unwanted pregnancies.
“Our brand of behavioral economics is much more mixed — about 50 percent economics and 50 percent psychology — than anywhere else. And it’s not just that we have economists and psychologists. The economists know a lot of psychology and the psychologists know a lot of economics,” Babcock said.
Saurabh Bhargava, assistant professor of economics and social and decision sciences, is a prime example of behavioral economics at work. He partnered with the Internal Revenue Service to redesign tax credit communication strategies that could help nearly millions of disadvantaged Americans claim billions in benefits.
“Ultimately this agenda suggests that the way we structure, frame and even market policies really does make a difference. That basic insight has the potential to radically improve outcomes, especially those at the greatest social and economic risk,” Bhargava said.
Carnegie Mellon University is credited as the leading institution in behavioral economics. It is the only academic institution to offer an undergraduate degree in behavioral economics, policy, and organizations and a Ph.D. in behavioral economics, jointly with the Tepper School of Business.
“The explosion of interest by government, nonprofit and industry organizations to use behavioral science has created a demand for trained behavioral economists,” Babcock said. “We are excited to offer both undergraduate and graduate students the opportunities to learn from us and partner on our research projects with government agencies, companies and nonprofits.”We are excited to offer both undergraduate and graduate students the opportunities to learn from us and partner on our research projects with government agencies, companies and nonprofits."

Aside from our academic lives, the Carnegie Mellon experience is heavily impacted by the presence of student groups on campus, mainly in the form of student organizations. From club soccer to engineering societies to eSports to ballroom dance, one of the proud attributes of the Carnegie Mellon community lies in the diversity of its student organizations. As such, the financing of these organizations, providing each with the necessary funds to operate and to thrive, is a topic that is vital to maintaining the large variety of student activities on campus.
To support our student organizations, there exist numerous funding sources on campus that allow organizations to gather the necessary funds to operate, to travel to tournaments or competitions, to host an event at Carnegie Mellon, or to engage in an initiative. These funding sources include the Undergraduate Senate, Graduate Student Assembly, Department of Student Affairs, Joint Funding Committee (JFC), Student Dormitory Council, and the Student Body Vice President for Organizations. Each source maintains its own funding philosophy and prefers to fund initiatives and organizations with respect to its own rules. In this student government column, I would like to briefly address and to inform the student body regarding one of the most popular mid-year funding sources: special allocations from the Undergraduate Senate.
The Undergraduate Senate receives its budget from a portion of the student activities fee, a cost that every student pays as a part of their enrollment. Since the Senate allocates funds using the student activities fee, our funding philosophy primarily focuses on the accessibility of the proposed event, initiative, or organization. In other words, the Senate prefers to fund proposals that are accessible to every undergraduate regardless of their academic standing, grade, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and religious or political beliefs.
Furthermore, we also consider the undergraduate benefit of the proposal. Typically, after carefully reviewing each funding application, the Undergraduate Finance Committee discusses and debates the benefit or impact that such proposal will bring to the student body. Thus, the Senate prefers to allocate funds to events and initiatives that provide benefits to large portions of the student body.
On top of this, as a mid-year funding source, the Senate is committed to funding unexpected costs, new organizations and initiatives, and organizations that were not JFC-funded the previous year. In essence, while the JFC funds in bulk on an annual basis for the upcoming academic year, the Senate and the various other funding sources listed above exist to help organizations get through the year in situations in which organizations face costs that were not planned last year in their JFC budget.
To apply for special allocations funding, log on to The Bridge and click “Common Funding Application” on the bottom right corner of the website, under “Campus Links.” Here, organizations can submit a common application to the various funding sources listed above. It is inevitable that organizations encounter unexpected costs throughout the year, and we are here to help you have a successful one. For any further questions about Senate Finance or special allocations, please contact senate-finance@andrew.cmu.edu.

On Egyptian national television, accomplished Egyptian lawyer Nabih al-Wahsh said the unthinkable. “I say when a girl walks about [in revealing clothing], it is a patriotic duty to harass her and a national duty to rape her,” he asserted. Al-Wahsh’s comments are perplexing, disappointing, and the sort to spark feelings of indignation in any decent person. What is more upsetting, however, is that they were not made in a vacuum; they are a part of a pandemic of sexual assault against women that has been sweeping across Egypt for years.
According to a 2008 survey by the Egyptian Center for Women’s Rights, 83 percent of Egyptian women and 98 percent of foreign women who visit Egypt say they have been sexually harassed. Other studies, by the United Nations (UN) for example, report other figures as high as 99.3 percent.
Before 2006, sexual assault was barely discussed in any national manner in Egypt. It wasn’t a politically divisive topic. Many viewed it as a foreign — Western — notion inapplicable to Egyptian culture. Then came the Eid-al-Fitr holiday in 2006 where more than 20 female demonstrators were sexually assaulted by groups of hundreds of men arriving in buses as nearby police did nothing.
Since 2006, mass sexual assault has become a grim but publicized part of Egyptian public life. At religious festivals, political protests, and in densely crowded urban locations, hundreds of men gather around a single woman and commit sexual assault. It’s called the circle of hell. Victims report being groped, stripped, penetrated, and raped while men in the outer perimeter of the circle deter rescuers from intervening. The ages of those assaulted range from seven to 70.
It is possible that mass sexual assault has always been commonplace in Egypt, but kept out of public and international discourse. The fall of the Mubarak regime in 2011 may have finally given women the political freedom to speak out publicly.
There’s also evidence that the regime change caused an uptick in mass sexual violence: 500 cases were reported between June 2012 and June 2014, 25 times more than the previous year’s figures. At political rallies and even at the inauguration of President Fatteh, women could be heard screaming.
Egypt’s issue truly entered international consciousness when acclaimed CBS journalist Lara Logan was assaulted in 2011. That night, while in the middle of a large crowd, her camera crew’s lights went dead. The surrounding crowds of men exploited the shroud of darkness to rip off Logan’s clothes, injure her, and sexually assault her for 30 minutes. She was flown back to the United States the next day, where she spent four days in the hospital. The horrifying event drew public shock, and even a private call from former President Barack Obama to Logan.
The consistency of mass sexual assault paints a grim picture of the state of gender equality in Egypt. These attacks are a tool used to shame women and dissuade them from participating in public life. Moreover, male attackers are protected by systemic advantages such as a complacent police force and a misogynistic society. In fact, one survey found that up to 60 percent of higher-educated Egyptian women blame the victims for being attacked, attributing the actions of men to promiscuous clothing, a hateful ideology that al-Wahsh parroted on national television. In contrast, most survivors of the circle of hell reported wearing conservative clothing and no make-up when attacked. 
Prejudice against women is a part of many cultures the world over, including Western culture. Pinpointing a root cause for Egypt’s mass sexual violence has proven especially difficult. Some, like journalist Shereen El Feki, argue that unemployment, social media, and a newfound lack of family surveillance are to blame. Others point to misplaced sexual desire, sexual deprivation, and a general wish to dominate women. The recurring theme, nonetheless, is a general disregard for women as people.
In response, groups such as Operation Anti-Sexual Harassment (OpAntiSH) have sprung up to aid Egyptian women. Volunteers wear padded clothing, helmets, and gloves as they attempt to get women from the center of mobs, often forming protective physical circles around them. Protective gear is especially crucial, since mobs created ‘tea stands’, where they have boiling water ready to be doused on rescuers. OpAntiSH also provides spare clothing, medical treatment, and counseling to survivors. 
OpAntiSH’s efforts are virtuous, to say the least. The group responded to 15 events in 2013 alone; nonetheless, on its own, cannot be relied on to crack societal change. After all, 80 Egyptian women were once infamously assaulted by mobs in a single day — more than OpAntiSH can handle. The current lack of repercussions, both judicial and societal, is what encourages men to join in these heinous acts publicly. Crowd-control is a must, as is a police force concerned enough to don riot gear and disperse malevolent mobs as they form. This solution doesn’t address the root cause of mass sexual violence: misogyny. It also requires extensive retraining of Cairo’s police force, which could be costly or ineffective.
The United States is currently experiencing a cross-industry revelation of systemic sexual assault against women. Egypt’s mass sexual assault is simply a different side of the same coin. The wider issue of misogyny is ingrained in Egypt’s culture and harder to solve. Sexism cannot be scared out of men or dispersed like mobs, but it can be unlearned. Brave Egyptians are launching campaigns, such as street art projects about sexual assault, that force their fellow citizens to grapple with societal misconceptions about women. And therein lies hope for the future,  that enough minds will be changed and that Egyptians will see it as a patriotic duty to protect women and a national duty to uplift them.

Editor’s note:  Transatlantic Thoughts is a weekly column that examines Carnegie Mellon’s student life from a foreigner’s perspective. Find previous installments @thetartan.org.
As initiated last week, this column will start to broaden its topics to discuss subjects outside Carnegie Mellon. This week, I will attempt to give some perspective to the notion of meritocracy as it is understood in the U.S.
Meritocracy is a cornerstone of the American philosophy: through the self-made man myth, it conveys a fair view of the society where everyone will have a chance to climb the social ladder, given enough hard work and determination. And there exists a certain number of illustrations of this principle, who happen to be widely spread in media: many of the CEOs of the major tech companies feature extraordinary life paths, rising from humble origins to become multibillionaires.
Here at Carnegie Mellon, the meritocracy is almost ideal: as I’ve described in my first article about the grading scheme, the most rewarded students are those who work the most, and not the most naturally intelligent ones. If you fail, your heart isn’t enough in the work and you learn a valuable life lesson: hard work is the key to success.
It is, of course, a good idea to follow these principles; however if you really believe in meritocracy, you have to follow the idea to the end. Indeed, if everyone were to be judged on their own merits, it is natural that they should start at the same point. This ground leveling is essential to fairness because it ensures that the game is not rigged. But here in the U.S., the leveling is unequal and leaves out the most important factor of all: wealth.
One of the things that impressed me when coming here was all the attention and infrastructure for people with disabilities. Almost all of the public buildings and public transportation are designed to welcome all people, and that is something Americans can be proud of. However, if disabled or more generally ill people have the physical ability to move freely, they still have to cover their health costs out of their pockets. Because of this, their purchasing power is significantly reduced and so are their life opportunities. I think it is not fair for someone hit by a genetic disease or by a disease caused by an external factor (think of the lead contamination in Flint, Michigan or a gun wound from a mass shooting) to have to support their health costs by themselves.
I wish we would live in a world where everyone has to endure the consequences of his own actions and only his own. However, randomness is an inherent part of life, and, in my opinion, a truly meritocratic society should at least try to compensate for random hazards in order to provide equal opportunities. Speaking of opportunities, whether or not you attend college is a decisive factor in your early career. And in the U.S., the decision to go to college will often not be taken on your high school merit, but rather on your parent’s wealth. I would not be here in graduate school if it weren’t for my grandmother’s inheritance.
These two key examples convey a simple idea: if you believe in the ideal of meritocracy, then you should fight so that it applies to the whole society and not only for yourself, regardless of how much merit you can have. The Republican party has recently been attacking the estate tax, nicknaming it the “death tax.” But the estate tax is a cornerstone of meritocracy: the wealth you receive from your ancestors is the most unfair advantage that can be given to you because nobody chooses where he is born. On the contrary, in an ideal meritocracy, the estate tax should be as high as to allow the only estate of sentimental values such as the family house to be passed to the descendant, to ensure that everyone can build up with his merit from the same starting position.
At this point, I could epitomize the arrogant French and claim that all of this problems don’t exist in France and its high-taxes welfare state. However, it is not the case at all. Actually, French sociologists have been studying the question of meritocracy in French society, and their findings are fascinating. I apologize in advance for this very gross summary of Bourdieu’s very fine analysis, which is a sociology standard around the world.
Apart from the economic capital which was discussed above, an individual accumulates throughout his life two other forms of capital: the social capital (relationships, professional network) and the cultural capital (knowledge, artistic culture, social status). It turns out that inequalities in the cultural capital or in the social capital when reaching adulthood take a huge toll on meritocracy afterward. Indeed, the French higher education system is mostly free and accessible to everyone; nevertheless, extensive studies have shown an over-representation of sons and daughters of the wealthiest subset of society in its elite schools.
The entrance examination I took for my undergraduate in France is an attempt at ideal meritocracy: you take two weeks of exams, both oral and written, and your admission to the school is determined only by your scores at those exams. Although everyone should have equal opportunities, the statistics of admission show that 60 percent of the admitted students had at least one parent who is either an executive or has an intellectual profession like being a professor. Those who had at least one parent professor performed in general much better at the exam, or had more chances to know that the exam even existed.
My take on this issue is that meritocracy is above all else an ideal. It is essential for a society because everyone needs to believe there exist some fairness and justice in the world they live in. But meritocracy should not be used to justify indecent inequalities between individuals: willingness to work hard is not the only difference between a multi-millionaire and a destitute. And as economic growth slows down worldwide, randomness and initial advantages are going to weigh in much more in determining one’s future.
This situation is familiar to old world countries, and it was often war that leveled the ground to ensure better meritocracy. After two devastating conflicts, most Western European countries decided that the state should step in to provide safety nets for its population. I often wonder which solution the U.S. will adapt to tackle this recent meritocratic crisis; in all cases, I enjoy analyzing this fascinating country that always offers perspective to me.

Hyperpartisanship continues to be a trend in American politics. Political discussion among people of opposite ends of the political spectrum usually leads to both sides "triggering" the other, or at the very least, spewing insults such as "snowflake" or "deplorable." Of course, politics has never been a smooth-sailing conversation topic. The saying "never discuss politics in polite company" often holds true in most social situations and has held true for longer than the current hostile political climate has. However, there is one disturbing trend that appears to be prevalent more than ever that both sides are guilty of: using tragedies to back a political agenda.
Many people claim that Republicans, collectively, jump at any terrorist attack to push for extreme vetting. President Donald Trump called for extreme vetting in response to the New York terrorist attack. He called for H.R. 3004,  Kate's Law, and used the death of Kathryn Stenile to " revise provisions relating to the reentry of removed aliens". Since then, Jim Steinle, father of Kate Steinle, has demanded that his daughter's name is taken out of the law and expressed that he finds the usage of his daughter's death to be revolting and not "honor[ing] her memory."
Democrats are guilty of politicizing tragedies as well. When there's a mass shooting, left-leaning reporters have been seen showing little to no respect for the victims or the incident. The infamous Hayley Geftman-Gold, former vice president and senior legal counsel at CBS in New York, stated that the victims of the Vegas shooting were "Republican gun-toters" who deserved "no sympathy." Additionally, the left has been criticized for being "disrespectful to the dead" by using mass shootings as evidence for the need for stronger gun laws.
Now, I would like to make clear that there is a distinction between creating pragmatic solutions in light of tragic events and politicizing tragedies. One calls for dialogue to evaluate the causes of the problem at hand and prevent them in the future. The other creates demonization, leading to both sides becoming even more polarized and unwilling to listen. This line, although important, is often blurred.
The goal of having a democratic republic, as is the case in the U.S., is to have both ends of the political spectrum covered so that one party does not rule the entire country and turn it into a single-party state. By combining aspects of a republic and a democracy, we strive to create a sovereign state where the people can vote for representatives who can represent a common vision. A system that should allow both sides to hold the other accountable and create a balanced society is now a society where dialogue is getting harder and clouded by emotion.
So where do we go from here? The solution is convoluted. Both sides' optimal strategy appears to be to remain defensive in order to protect themselves from each other. If one party appears to be viciously attacking the fundamentals of another, the best strategy appears to be to fight back with an equally vicious defense. Left-leaning media outlets criticize the Republican party; the right, in response, cries out "fake news!" Conversely, the current Republican-majority house takes over the nation; consequently, the left gets defensive and demands that Trump leaves office. Not fighting back makes one feel vulnerable, but further adding to the divisive climate only repels us further away.
One step that we can take is to separate the events from our emotions. Sensationalism appeals to strong emotions such as outrage, and it is easy to fall into that trap. Currently, outlets have been acting more like gossip sites than accredited sources for the latest news. The days leading up to the U.S. 2016 presidential election, left-leaning media entertained Trump by putting great emphasis on his outlandish behavior and outrageous tweets. Conversely, right-leaning media constantly reminded the nation about Clinton's e-mail scandal and the controversy surrounding her husband. By putting gossip over actual truth-telling, we have grown to resent each other even more. Instead of holding debates on handling gun violence and immigration policy, we combined the person with the person's respective political beliefs. We conflated a person's political affiliation to the value of the person as a whole: Republicans are gun-obsessed racists, Democrats are whining "snowflakes."
Putting less emphasis on pathos and shifting it towards logos is easier said than done. When there is diversity in thought, conflict is inevitable, thus making a society in which the people can all agree on a common vision is near impossible, if not completely. However, the hostile political climate is not sustainable. A nation that has such division between parties cannot hold productive discussions that will lead to solutions. By calling each other names and dismissing the news that contradicts our paradigm as "fake news," we are straying further from the possibility of reaching compromise.

Imagine a utopia free of guns or weapons of any type where mass shootings ceased to exist. As a personal believer in the Second Amendment, I can still see why the promise of such a world may be a tempting reason to ban machines capable of murder. However, the heroin epidemic currently facing this nation shows just how effective no-tolerance banning is to solving problems. Like the heroin epidemic, America’s mass shooting problems do not lie in any physical item; they lie in something much deeper. A lack of initiative by our nation to treat the mentally ill and media glamorization of killings have led to individuals becoming disturbed and even encouraged by society to carry out the most horrible deeds.
Like the unfortunately countless number of shootings that preceded it, the Texas church mass shooting has exemplified America’s sad handling of mental illnesses. Like almost any mass shooter, the Texas church shooter was not some random citizen that woke up one day and decided to be a psycho killer; there were red flags everywhere. According to CNN, this is a man that “had served a year in military jail for beating and choking his wife, threatening her with a firearm, and fracturing her child’s skull.” In 2012, he even escaped a health facility “where he was being treated for ‘mental disorders.’” 
While more in-depth background checks could arguably have benefits, America’s primary issue is not its handling of firearms; it is the handling of the mentally ill people who receive these firearms. According to the Huffington Post, in a year, one in four adults have a mental illness. Despite this, discussions of mental health are often rare and on the verge of taboo. When serious red flags in someone’s mental health do appear, health treatment centers are often substituted with prison bars. According to the American Psychological Association, “about 10 percent to 25 percent of U.S. prisoners suffer from serious mental illnesses, such as major affective disorders or schizophrenia.” We continue to place these people in overcrowded prisons and solitary confinement, both of which have been found to have potentially detrimental effects on their mental health.
Norway’s actions are an example of the steps that America could be taking to reduce gun violence and mass shootings. With an incarceration rate that is nearly one tenth of that of the U.S. according to Business Insider, Norway’s prison system places a focus on rehabilitation of prisoners over punishment. While America’s focus is on whether or not conditions are horrible enough to make inhabitants “pay” for their crime, Norway’s prisons focus on what Business Insider describes as “normalcy” with bar-less windows, kitchens, vocational classes, and an overall focus on recovery. The result is astounding. While 76.6 percent of prisoners are re-arrested within five years of people released in the U.S., only 20 percent of those in Norway find their way back into the prison system within this span.
As a country that embraces hunting and sport, Norway is a nation that exemplifies the fact that it is possible to allow citizens to own firearms while being a safe nation. While the murder rate in the United States is a somewhat high 4.88 per 100,000, it is only 0.56 per 100,000 in Norway according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.
This leads to the question of what would have happened if the Texas church shooter would have been placed in a Norwegian prison for a year instead of behind American bars. The red flags were there. If a focus was placed on rehabilitating him rather than putting him through a year of the American prison system, only to be freed onto the streets more mentally unstable than when he went in, perhaps there would be 26 more people alive today.
Now, imagine this person, whom America failed to treat, is sitting at home watching TV. The evening news is shown, and the large face of another mass shooter is displayed at center. According to several studies, this is a common cause of copycat incidents and has given mentally unstable individuals the role models and storylines that help motivate their horrific actions. Dr. Park Dietz, one of America’s leading psychiatrists, found that “saturation-level news coverage of mass murder causes, on average, one more mass murder in the next two weeks.” According to a study by the journal PLOS ONE, 20 to 30 percent of mass murders are a result of such coverage.
In order to stop such retaliation, the American Psychological Association suggested that news media should not “show the killer’s face,” “incessantly repeat his name,” or “repeat any of his manifestos or grievances.” Instead, they should be focusing on the stories of victims and humanizing them. Fortunately, a large portion of the attention from the Texas church shooting has shifted to the hero who ended the killing spree, but a much more than necessary coverage was placed on the life and motives of the individual behind the killings.
In summary, the solution to ending America’s mass shooting problems is not banning guns or cracking down on the rights of individuals. The first steps to ending these tragedies are to take initiatives as a nation to battle mental illnesses. Replace punishment with rehabilitation for all but the most extreme cases. Place more emphasis on treating mental illnesses and remove taboos associated with them from society. Remove all possible mass shooter motivators from news coverage that can result in mentally unstable individuals retaliating. Place an emphasis on people, not politics.

In light of the recent indictments emerging from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, some Congressional Republicans have responded in an alarming manner. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), co-sponsored by Reps. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) and Louie Gohmert (R-TX), called for Mueller to be fired on the grounds that he is somehow inextricably linked to Hillary Clinton and her 2016 presidential campaign. Moreover, President Donald Trump himself expressed anger with Mueller and the Russia investigation, as apparent in his tweet — presented in all caps to emphasize just how strongly he feels he’s correct — “….Also, there is NO COLLUSION!”
The validity of that statement remains to be seen, but Mueller’s investigation will almost certainly provide an answer sometime in the future. In the meantime, we are left to grapple with the possibility that Mueller could be fired. How exactly that might come about, if at all, is difficult to say. However, it should be rather difficult for Trump to do it, and for Gaetz, Biggs, and Gohmert it is all but impossible.
One key fact here is the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. In light of Sessions’ controversy over his failure to disclose communications with Russian officials, the Attorney General recused himself from the Russia investigation to prevent a conflict of interest. What would presumably be Trump’s easiest means of firing Mueller — ordering Sessions to do it — is now impossible. In place of Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is overseeing Mueller’s investigation. Also important is the ardent support Rosenstein has shown for Mueller, indicating he would be unlikely to fire the Special Counsel if Trump asked him to. This makes sense given that he appointed Mueller himself, but he later affirmed his support when questions of Mueller’s potential arose. “Director Mueller is going to have the full independence he needs to conduct that investigation,” Rosenstein said.
So, if Trump wants Mueller gone, the path to that outcome is ethically questionable. Namely, Trump could adopt one of Nixon’s tactics — fire the overseer until one willing to fire the investigator is appointed. This ultimately got Nixon in more trouble, though, and any attempt by Trump to do this could potentially bring calls for impeachment. If Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) is to be believed, there “[would] be holy hell to pay” if Trump were to remove Mueller.
This whole situation seems to be thematically consistent with the rest of Trump’s presidential tenure. There is a flavor of procedural uncertainty and an undertone of autocracy. We are left then to wonder what might come of the remainder of the Trump presidency. With impeachment still seeming unlikely, and with anti-Trump Republican incumbents announcing retirement in mass, Mueller might be the only real threat to the Trump presidency beyond record-low approval ratings and a Democratic challenger in 2020. With Paul Manafort and company recently indicted on numerous charges, Mueller is closing in on the President. The information from these indictments shows that Trump campaign officials were at the very least trying to collude with Russia, though it is a distinct possibility that they were too incompetent to succeed in this effort.
Given how high up these indictments are reaching — Manafort was at one point Trump’s campaign manager — we know that Trump feels threatened. And we expect him to do what he usually does when he doesn’t like the facts: lie. He will lie and lie and try to justify firing Mueller, and if he can make it past the procedural roadblocks and fire Mueller, all bets are off. Conversations of impeachment previously limited to Democrats in Congress will reach the rest of Washington. Moreover, given the Democrats’ recent gains in the 2017 election, it might be in the GOP’s best interest to finally stand up to Trump.
