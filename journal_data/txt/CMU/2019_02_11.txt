This is Penalty Shouts, The Tartan’s sports column inspired by the The New Yorker’s column Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled column will focus on anything and everything funny in the sports world that is deserving of our comedic attention.
Okay, kids. They called in the Editor-in-Chief to recount the Superb Bowl because Matt could not write this week for some reason...something about athlete's pen? That was an athlete's foot joke, for those who do not get the reference, which is a kind of mold athletes grow because they make them all shower in the same place. But Matt cannot get that, because he merely writes about people who shower in those places. Hence the pen.
This made sense to me, because in high school, I was on the girl's varsity basketball team for a year, before being cut because I was bad at basketball. I think people are too mean to The Tartans here, because I bet it's really hard to be a student athlete, and I would know that because of the aforementioned stint as a real, varsity basketball player. And no, my high school did not have a junior varsity basketball team, or cut anyone from the varsity team, why are you asking?
Okay. The super bowl. I wanted to eat nachos during it because I really like nachos and it seemed like the right time to have them for dinner, so I got three orders of chips from Gallo, a weird frozen black bean enchilada casserole from Entropy, and various odds and ends of cheese. With the Gallo salsa mixed with some adobo sauce, it was really good! The Gallo guy asked me if I was having a party because I got three orders of chips. Alas, I was not. 
I played Luigi's Haunted Mansion (a VERY scary horror game) on my friend's 3DS, ate my nachos, and watched local Vermont commercials from a weird illegal stream, so a pretty good Super Bowl. 
The that's thing about the Super! Bowl. It's like, really super. Like just so great. They pick the most superest, most universally adored teams and players, and get them all on the field!
Wait — I'm being told that Tom Brady is on the winning team. I no longer stand by my comments because I cannot get behind a man who supports...such terrible fear mongering...such poorly-informed bigotry against a whole class...such ill-supported, offensive flim-flam. The fact that he is allowed to be a public figure should be a stain on our society. I am referring, of course, to the fact that he DOESN'T EAT NIGHTSHADES? What did tomatoes and potatoes ever do to him???? What a sociopath. No wonder he's a fascist.

Free agency this year for baseball has been slow, to say the least. The two names that are still sticking around, waiting for a contract to sign, are Manny Machado and Bryce Harper. As a small market team, the Pittsburgh Pirates are not really in contention for either player, since they’re star players looking to go to a large market and the Pirates are unable to sign anybody with a contract larger than several million a year. Obviously, it’s shocking that Machado and Harper are still around, but the Pirates have made little headway in the free agent market themselves.
In recent weeks, the Pirates have signed mostly minor league deals with players past their prime or players who’ve never really hit it. Francisco Liriano and Melky Cabrera were signed to 1 year Minor League contracts, and so were the younger players Nick Franklin and Brandon Maurer. It’s classic Pirates fashion to sign a slew of players who will get a shot at Spring Training to play in the Majors again, but even the Pirates’ big-name signings this winter don’t carry the assured weight of pushing them into the playoffs. 
Lonnie Chisenhall and Jung Ho Kang are the two position players that are poised to join — or rejoin, in Kang’s case — the Pirates. Chisenhall is a corner infielder/outfielder who has a career slash line of .268/.320/.427. He’s a great utility player to round out a roster, a veteran of an Indians team that has turned around their historic misfortunes, so he could be a missing piece to the puzzle for the Pirates. However, Chisenhall only fills the gap left by the injury to Gregory Polanco and not the desperately needed batting depth at shortstop. Jung Ho Kang does the same, with the positions played by Kang matching those of Chisenhall and Polanco, and his career slash is just slightly better than Chisenhall’s. After Kang’s arrest in the winter of 2016, his position with the Pirates was tenuous, but he’s quoted as desiring to make things right with the team. 
For pitching depth, Jordan Lyles helps at the back end of the rotation, and with long innings relief, but the core of the Pirates rotation can be shaky. Chad Kuhl has an ERA above 4.0 and a WHIP that is well above 1.000. Trevor Williams had a good season last year, but some of his statistics leave questions hanging over his head, and Joe Musgrove is the same. So the Jordan Lyles signing is not quite inspiring confidence in the Pirates pitching rotation. Although, there are a few free agents left on the market that the Pirates could sign to help with that, like Dallas Keuchel, even though his contract may be more expensive than the Pirates are willing to shell out. Realistically, the Pirates could be in contention for Clay Buchholz or Gio Gonzalez, and their ability is just a little more inspiring than the current back end of the rotation.
It’s shocking that these names remain in free agency, though. Kuechel, Buchholz, and Gonzalez are all players who should be on some form of contract, but teams seem to be collectively holding off on signing anybody whose name could boost the price of their contract. The three players are all pitchers, and the first date for pitchers and catchers to report is Monday, Feb. 11. Most teams don’t report until Wednesday, Feb. 13 or Thursday, Feb. 14, but players are finding themselves out of jobs right as their season is starting. With the MLB’s Collective Bargaining Agreement up for negotiation in two winters from now, teams are gearing up for an extended arbitration with the Player’s Association. 
FiveThirtyEight wrote an article titled, “How to Save MLB Free Agency.” The most glaring detail of the article is the decline in average dollar value for free agents in the past five seasons, with the average contract value dropping from $12.6 million in 2015-16 to $7.8 million last season. The Chicago Tribune titled an article, “Something is rotten about baseball free agency.” ESPN is calling it “The broken winter” and writing about “Why baseball must fix free agency ASAP.”
There are massive issues with the way the MLB has been moving recently, with an increasing reliance on technology, growing divides between owners and players, and worst of all, potentially adding a DH to the National League. But this winter of free agency is showing some of the worst parts of an oligarchical control over a market. Workers aren’t getting paid the way they should, consumers are becoming despondent, and money is sitting in the pockets of the owners. A Fansided blog by a Phillies fan says that the Phillies are ruining free agency by sitting on their hands, waiting for the price of Machado or Harper or Keuchel to go down, but saying it’s strictly the fault of the Phillies Front Office is saying that one team has the ability to control the entire free agent market, which means there are a few larger issues with the way free agency works.

"5G moves us to a truly connected society with very high data rates, low latency, and massively interconnected devices," said Carnegie Mellon University Engineering and Public Policy (EPP) Department Head Doug Sicker, as quoted in a January press release.
5G operates on three different spectrum bands (low-, mid-, and high-band) compared to 4G’s two. Sicker, along with Kazi Mohammed Saidul Huq of the Instituto de Telecomunicações in Portugal and EPP Carnegie Mellon graduate student Rohit Singh, is working not to develop 5G technology but to increase the bandwidth spectrum that 5G can take advantage of.
The “G” in 5G stands for “generation,” as in the fifth generation of cellular communications technology. While each generation is defined by certain technical specifications, what’s more exciting to researchers are the ways each new generation of mobile network tech has changed the way we use technology in our everyday lives. 2G gave us text messages and multimedia messages; 3G supported mobile internet; 4G was fast enough for streaming.
“Our work looks to provide massive amounts of new spectrum for IoT [Internet of Things] type services, particularly with bandwidth-intense demands,” explained Sicker.
5G is especially suited for the Internet of Things. While a 5G network can support vastly higher speeds and greater numbers of users than 3G and 4G, the fastest 5G signals can’t pass through walls.
“While this may sound like a disadvantage, containing the signal in a small space like a building or even a room can help multiple users and devices reuse the same spectrum,” reads the January press release on Sicker’s team’s work. “Furthermore, this containment can help keep harmful interference to a minimum, allowing the same frequency to be used from one house to the next without getting in each other's way...5G Advanced opens up a whole new world of possibility for connected indoor devices: smart thermostats and refrigerators, security systems, even integrated sensors to monitor building health.”
Telecom giants are understandably looking to 5G as their next big draw for customers, and things are heating up as widespread 5G draws nearer on the horizon. 
On Thursday, Sprint filed a federal lawsuit against AT&T, accusing the company of intentionally misleading customers that their phones were already receiving 5G network speeds.
“Some 5G networks are technically live already,” writes Michael Simon in a PCWorld report, “but they’re limited to home-based broadband and hotspots in certain areas of the U.S…there won’t be…nationwide coverage until at least 2020.”
While AT&T does operate a small number of 5G hotspots, Sprint’s concern is actually with AT&T’s 4G services. While connected to AT&T’s 4G networks, some AT&T devices have replaced the 4G LTE icon with “5GE.” 5GE does not meet the technical definition of 5G — it’s a slightly faster 4G network — but according to AT&T, this stands for “5G Evolution,” as in an evolution in technology that will eventually lead to 5G. “We feel very comfortable with how we have characterized the new service that we’re launching,” said AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson on CNBC Friday morning.
“In its claim, Sprint said it commissioned a survey that found 54 percent of consumers believed the 5GE networks were the same as or better than 5G, and that 43 percent think if they buy an AT&T phone today it will be 5G capable, even though neither of those things are true,” explains Engadget news editor Richard Lawler.  “The significance of AT&T’s deception cannot be overstated,” reads the claim.
“We understand why our competitors don't like what we are doing, but our customers love it,” said AT&T in a statement to the press. If Sprint’s suit is successful, AT&T will no longer be allowed to use “5GE” in their marketing. 
Rather than using cutting-edge tech to boost corporate rivalries, Carnegie Mellon’s 5G research is fostering international collaboration. Sicker’s transatlantic team represents CMU Portugal, a research partnership program with the Instituto de Telecomunicações in Aveiro, Portugal. "We are excited about this initial work," Sicker said, "and we hope to go after much bigger projects with our colleagues in Portugal in the future."

The heart is the most essential human organ, regulating blood flow to every other part of the body. Engineers at Dartmouth College’s Thayer School of Engineering have developed a device that can convert the kinetic energy of this important organ into electricity to power implantable devices.
Millions of people rely on pacemakers, defibrillators, and other vital implants that run on batteries that need to be replaced every five to 10 years, a complicated and expensive procedure that puts patients at risk for infection.
"We're trying to solve the ultimate problem for any implantable biomedical device," said Dartmouth engineering professor and lead researcher on the project John X. J. Zhang in a press release. "How do you create an effective energy source so the device will do its job during the entire lifespan of the patient, without the need for surgery to replace the battery?"
Funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and published as the cover story for Advanced Materials Technologies, the study was a three-year collaboration between researchers at Dartmouth and clinicians at University of Texas Health San Antonio.
The team invented a dime-sized modification to existing pacemakers that continually charges their batteries using a lead wire that converts kinetic energy from the heart. They introduced a thin polymer piezoelectric film called PVDF which, when designed with porous structures, can convert small mechanical motion to electricity. In addition, the same technology has potential for integration with sensors to allow doctors to monitor patients’ conditions in real time.
"Of equal importance is that the device not interfere with the body's function," said Dartmouth researcher and first author Lin Dong. "We knew it had to be biocompatible, lightweight, flexible, and low profile, so it not only fits into the current pacemaker structure but is also scalable for future multi-functionality."
Engineers estimate that the technology is around five years away from commercialization. The team will use the next two years of their NIH funding to complete the pre-clinical process and obtain regulatory approval.
"We've completed the first round of animal studies with great results which will be published soon," said Zhang. "There is already a lot of expressed interest from the major medical technology companies, and Andrew Closson, one of the study's authors working with Lin Dong and an engineering Ph.D. Innovation Program student at Dartmouth, is learning the business and technology transfer skills to be a cohort in moving forward with the entrepreneurial phase of this effort."

During the Zika virus outbreak, public health officials attempting to stop the virus from spreading further and scientists trying to understand its genetics were limited by the fact that the blood of a sick patient does not contain very many Zika virus capsids. In response to the outbreak, researchers in Broad Institute scientist Pardis Sabeti’s laboratory developed a new computational method known as the Compact Aggregation of Targets for Comprehensive Hybridization (CATCH) method, which they believe can help overcome that major hurdle in disease detection.
This new method involves designing molecular baits for infectious viruses and each of their possible strains. Baits are molecular probes composed of short DNA or RNA strands, which pair with complementary viral DNA strands. Because this method is more adaptable to different viruses, it allows smaller sequencing centers worldwide to conduct disease surveillance in a cheaper and more efficient manner. 
The study was led by Hayden Metsky, a graduate student from MIT, and Katie Siddle, a postdoctoral researcher also from MIT. According to Christian Matranga, a co-senior author of the study, advanced genomic sequencing tools like CATCH will help scientists to detect outbreaks earlier and gather more data on pathogens than previously possible. 
Older virus surveillance tools are not quite as effective as CATCH. In the past, scientists have often made use of metagenomic sequencing, a method of sequencing which scans through all the genetic material in a given clinical sample, making low-abundance viruses like Zika detectable. However, the major flaw of this method is that it typically misses some viral material which is hidden within a variety of other microbes as well as the patient’s DNA. 
Another method was enriching a sample for some given virus by immobilizing a target virus’s genetic material with a genetic bait. The rest of the genetic material is then washed away, leaving only the virus’s genetic material. Although this has worked successful in the past for analyzing the viral genomes of Ebola and Lassa, the probe designs only worked for a single microbe. Therefore, researchers had to know exactly what they were looking for when using molecular baits. 
Compared to past approaches, CATCH is a major improvement. The CATCH method permits those using it to design custom probes which can capture the genetic material of any microbial species, including any virus which can infect humans. A user then inputs genomes taken from the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s sequencing database into CATCH. CATCH then determines the sets of probes most fitting for whatever a user would like to recover and sends this information to a company that synthesizes probes.
Tests of some CATCH probes have already shown promise. A few probe sets’ sequencing data contained more than 18 times the viral content than before enrichment, which allows researchers to generate more complete genomes from this data than they were able to before. Another set of CATCH-designed probes were able to rescue samples of Lassa virus from 2018 that were unable to be sequenced without enrichment. The research team also greatly improved viral detection in samples composed of unknown sequences coming from both patients and mosquitoes. 
The research team has been working with other scientists in West Africa to establish laboratories and furnish them with equipment capable of analyzing pathogen sequences. In this region, viral outbreaks and fevers that cannot be clearly diagnosed are common, so Siddle hopes that CATCH will allow scientists to more efficiently perform metagenomic sequencing. For fevers especially, CATCH allows for further investigation if they are suspected of having a viral cause. As for future applications, the research team hopes it can be useful for clinical diagnoses. The team believes that CATCH can also improve large scale high-resolution studies of microbial communities.

Last Friday, the Chinese Student Association (CSA) hosted their New Year Extravaganza around the black chairs of the Cohon University Center to welcome the “Year of the Pig” of the lunar calendar. The entire event was well balanced between hyped performances and intermittent food breaks, allowing the attendees to enjoy exciting performances while tasting indigenous Asian night-market food provided by different student organizations, such as the Japanese Student Association (JSA), the Korean American Students’ Association (KASA), and the Awareness of Roots in Chinese Culture Organization (ARCC).
I attended the event as one of the dancers representing KASA dance. However, it was a total situational irony that led me to the event. Even though I am Chinese, I did not plan to go because of a potential time conflict. But, as a member of KASA dance, I was invited back to the event as a performer, dancing in front of my Chinese friends while wearing colors representing Korea. Korea! I thought in disbelief. It took me a while to internalize the turn of the event without feeling weird. For those who are acquainted with the cultural hot pot of America, this probably would only merit a shrug, a “Yeah, so what?” But as one of the Chinese international students coming from a homogeneous society, where everything about New Year is patriotic and strictly emphasizes China, seeing outside cultural elements dominating the center stage was a brand new experience for me.
I noticed the mentality difference when our KASA dance choreographer, Christine, proposed that during our performance we can wear shirts with “Korea” spelled in large letters in the front. Out of reflex, I immediately uttered a jammed “no, no, no” in response to her proposal. For a second, she frowned and looked at me in confusion. At that moment, I realized that I could never properly translate my previous eighteen years of Chinese New Years’ experience, but can only change my mindset to accept and discover the beauty in what used to be utterly unimaginable, yet is now a different kind of reality.
I remember standing on the second floor of the UC, overlooking the crowd, seeing a variety of people converging at the food stands, then forming a semi-circle to view the performance, amazed by how intercultural and welcoming CSA had made this event to be. Each body feeling the beats in their own rhythm, each mind taking in this occasion through their own lenses, each person contributing a little something unique and taking away a little something unique — just like how they also transformed my Chinese New Year from family reunions, firecrackers, red decor, and traditional Chinese customs to now, food from all over Asia, people from all over the world and a new reality that shines in the beaming beauty of intercultural experience.

Movies
Silence of the Lambs
This 1991 horror classic is another one of my personal favorites and available to view on Netflix. This creepy psychological horror thriller finds Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) interviewing cannibal serial killer Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to gain insight into the mind of a killer. The film doesn't take long to get under the viewer's skin. The concept in and of itself is disturbing, but the film goes into it all the way without sugarcoating anything. It's an undeniable horror masterpiece and a masterclass in suspense and tension. Anthony Hopkins is barely on screen, and yet he leaves an undeniable mark on the film's tone. Every performance is directed to perfection. The script is also incredibly tight, with the psychological breakdown of disturbing characters like Lecter and Buffalo Bill providing fascinating insight into the mind of the grisly murderers and killers we hear about on the news. This film is the only horror film to date that has won Best Picture, and it is well deserved. If you haven't seen this classic, check this out as soon as you can. 
Beasts of No Nation
This Netflix original film is the second best in their catalog and one of the best films of 2015. It was sadly overlooked by the Academy at the time since it was a Netflix release, but that didn't stop the film from getting the recognition it deserved from lovers of film everywhere. The film follows a child soldier named Agu (Abraham Attah) who is recruited into a guerrilla army by a warlord (Idris Elba) during a fictional civil war in a fictional African nation. The performance by Abraham Attah was one of the best child actor performances I've ever seen. He plays a battle hardened soldier so well that I forgot I was watching an actor. Idris Elba also gives one of his best ever performances as the unnamed warlord, playing a very complicated character with gravitas and bringing layers of empathy to his character. The film shows the horrors of war on full display, and the script does not shy away from exploring the consequences and complicated politics that goes into these kinds of civil wars. You slowly watch as these characters abandon their humanity for the sake of a cause, and you wonder if they can ever find themselves again after the atrocities they have seen and committed. This is a very dark film that is not for the faint of heart, but if you're into war films or want a fascinating, well directed, well shot drama to watch, then I highly recommend this film. 
TV Shows
The Vietnam War
If you don't know much about the Vietnam War, this 10-episode docuseries will leave you both disgusted and fascinated with the conflict. Ken Burns and Lynn Novick spent over a decade compiling archival footage, documents, and interviews for the project, which makes History Channel documentaries look like student work. It constantly shifts between U.S and Vietnamese narratives, starting with the revolution against French colonial rule and ending with Watergate. The interviews with jaded veteran foot soldiers are reminiscent of Walter Dean Myers' Fallen Angels, while the interviews with decision-makers and historians' analysis make it seem like the U.S had no choice but to invade. The Vietnam War will make you a skeptic of our government if you aren't already, and with narration by Peter Coyote and a soundtrack featuring Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Simon and Garfunkel, and The Byrds, it's a fun watch.
One Day at a Time
This Netflix reboot of a classic 1975 sitcom has all the heart of its predecessor, updated for a modern audience. It follows the life of Penelope Alvarez (Justina Machado), a Cuban-American veteran living in an apartment with her two children and aging mother, played by the indomitable Rita Moreno. Other characters include Penelope’s privileged landlord, her meek boss, and various love interests. The series gained critical acclaim in its first two seasons for tackling serious issues such as racism, homophobia, immigration, and mental illness. The third season, released on Feb. 8, continues the trend, discussing drugs, alcoholism, teenage sex, and more. Some might accuse it of being moralistic, but it approaches each episode with such genuine heart that any missteps are easy to forgive. In an age of cinematic television and anti-heroes, it’s nice to see a sitcom with a consistently funny and lovable cast. One Day at a Time will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it just might make you wish you were part of the Alvarez family as well.

Welcome to Pop Culture Roundup! Can’t keep up with what’s going on? Check here for quick blurbs on the major stories!
21 Savage arrested by ICE
On Sunday, Feb. 3, Grammy-nominated rapper, 21 Savage, was arrested by ICE officials in Atlanta for living illegally in the United States for over a decade. 21 Savage, whose real name is Shayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, has long been associated with Atlanta, GA, often performing with other Atlanta-native rappers like Lil Yachty and Migos. The agency alleges that 21 Savage is actually a United Kingdom native, having immigrated to the U.S. in 2005 (when he was 7 years old) with a visa that expired a year later. In an apparent effort to debase his character, an ICE official told CNN that his “whole public persona is false.”
While many fans were stunned by this news, many were also skeptical of the timing of his arrest. According to 21 Savage’s lawyers, he had filed for a U Visa in 2017 (which is a kind of visa set aside for victims of crimes who have suffered substantial abuse while in the U.S.), but the agency had not taken action until that weekend. The reason why this timing seems suspect? Only a few days beforehand, 21 Savage had released a music video for his song “A Lot,” which explicitly called out ICE’s inhumane border policies and called out Trump’s family separation policy.
He also performed the track on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, again criticizing the agency on national television. Whether or not this was the reason ICE decided to take action that weekend, 21 Savage’s arrest shines a brighter light on the agency’s tendency to target and harm immigrants — they’ve tried to damage his public image by “exposing” his immigrant status and invalidating his experiences as a black man in America. On the positive side, a conversation surrounding the intersection of black identity and immigration has been brought to the forefront, but the rapper has been denied bail, and currently faces deportation.
Liam Neeson’s comment in Cold Pursuit interview
Taken actor Liam Neeson faced backlash over comments in a recent interview for his upcoming movie, Cold Pursuit. In Cold Pursuit, Neeson portrays a father set on avenging the death of his son. When asked by The Independent’s Clémence Michallon how he stepped into the revenge mentality, Neeson responded with an anecdote recounting how, after hearing how one of his female friends had been raped by an identifiable black man, he had deliberately searched for black men to fight.
He said, “I went up and down areas with a cosh [a bludgeon], hoping I’d be approached by somebody — I’m ashamed to say that,” he told The Independent in an interview published on Monday. “And I did it for maybe a week, hoping some [Neeson apparently gestured air quotes with his fingers] ‘black bastard’ would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know? So that I could … kill him. [My response] shocked me and it hurt me. I did seek help. I went to a priest, I aired my confession, I was reared a Catholic. I had two very, very good friends that I talked to. And believe it or not, power-walking helped me. Two hours every day, to get rid of this. I’m not racist. This was nearly 40 years ago.”
Some praised Neeson for his willingness to make his past — and his efforts to fix it — public, but many have criticized him for playing hero with his admission. While it’s important for people to recognize their own prejudices and to have the difficult conversations confronting those prejudices, Neeson’s comments fail to accept the truth of those racist comments. By saying “I’m not racist,” Neeson is essentially denying the prejudice behind his behavior and deflecting responsibility rather than taking ownership of that shame. In addition, a large part of the way his comments were perceived was due to the setting in which he said them. An interview about a movie where a man tries to get revenge for the death of his son is maybe not the best place to begin a dialogue about confronting problematic pasts.
As late-night host Trevor Noah says, “If Liam Neeson had told this story on Oprah, and there was like a conversation, then we would have seen it as a person admitting to a time in their life when they allowed their anger and hatred to fester into racism they’re ashamed of.” It may not be right to call him “brave” for admitting his racist past, but there is almost something powerful in confronting it so publicly. Neeson’s admission — information that he volunteered, not called out for — does highlight an important point: that society can encourage hate to fester inside you if you’re not careful, without even realizing how harmful that hate really is. Taking a moment to step back and examine your own actions is what allows you to realize that and grow. Perhaps with a more nuanced perspective and presentation, this could be a step forward in how society discusses racism in the past and present.
Ariana Grande and Japanese BBQ grills
Biggest Day 1 Global Pop Album. Biggest Day 1 Global for a Female Artist. #1 in 84 Countries. Ariana Grande is back in the headlines this past week after releasing her fifth album, thank u, next (not to be confused with the single of the same name) and making music history. However, that’s not the only reason she’s been one of the most talked-about musicians in the past month. After being criticized for her appropriation of Japanese culture in the music video for “7 Rings,” Grande received major criticism for her latest tattoo: a depiction of Japanese characters shi and chirin on her palm. What was meant to mean “7 Rings,” in reference to her song, actually meant shichirin — a type of traditional small Japanese BBQ grill.
In the caption of the original photo, Grande stated that it was meant to be an abbreviation of the full phrase (seen in the “7 Rings” music video), shortened due to how painful the tattoo was. Angering and confusing fans, Grande doesn’t seem to have absorbed the criticism concerning her pattern of cultural appropriation and insensitivity. While the tattoo may have come from a genuine place, the lack of research seems to indicate a similar lack of respect for Japanese language and culture. A mistake may just be a mistake — and a bad tattoo just a bad tattoo — but this is one that could have easily been avoided by consulting a tutor. And she eventually did—after asking for help to fix her Japanese BBQ grill tattoo, her tutor explained to her that she could easily fix it by placing the character for “finger” directly above and in-between the characters she already has. Since Japanese is read right to left, top to bottom, the tattoo would’ve read something a little closer to “7 Rings.” But instead, Grande got the character for “finger” and a heart tattooed directly underneath the character for “7,” which unfortunately made it even worse. Rather than “7 Rings,” the tattoo now reads “Japanese BBQ grill, finger, heart” In an effort to fix the problem, Grande ignored what her Japanese tutor recommended, only to end up with an even worse kanji tattoo.°

This week, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald will be screening in McConomy. This was reviewed in previous editions two separate times.
Personally, I can’t even pretend to like this movie or say anything good about it. It’s a confused mess of a film that doesn’t know what to focus on. It’s fun to watch Eddie Redmayne again, but he seems like he’s there for a paycheck at this point. Everyone there only seems like they were there for a paycheck, which I’m sure isn’t true, but the film is so lazy and incompetent that I can’t think of another reason anyone would sign up for the project.
The biggest crime of this film is not one of Grindelwald’s, but that it’s so boring. There is so much exposition throughout the whole thing that you get weighed down by it all. There also appears to be no consistency in the universe anymore either with the magic powers, beasts, and even the timeline of when certain characters are alive. The visual effects and technical side are all bland, the score goes unnoticed, and the action in the film is dull. I honestly can’t think of a single reason anyone would want to watch this, even die hard Harry Potter fans. Go see it for free if you’ve been meaning to, but go in with low expectations and don’t expect them to be met.

With the Lunar New Year, many countries in Asia celebrate the new year according to the traditional lunar calendar. In China, nian gao is a popular rice cake made to celebrate the New Year, which is also known as the Spring Festival. Nian gao literally translates to “sticky cake,” but can also mean "year cake" or "higher year" due to the homophonic nature of the language. 
There are many types of nian gao, according to the different cuisines of various regions of China. Shanghai nian gao is savory and white, stir-fried with beef, pork, and vegetables. Northern nian gao is sweet to taste, usually steamed or fried. Guangdong’s (Canton) version is also sweet, with a distinct dark color due to brown sugar. It is steamed first, then fried, and dipped in egg. Traditionally, nian gao is steamed or fried because most families did not have ovens. In the United States, the prevalence of ovens led to the popularity of baked nian gao. This recipe is a gluten-free Chinese American baked concoction, closest to the Guangdong style that has been refined through thirty years of trial and error.
Yield: 25-30 pieces | Prep time: 15 minutes | Cook time: 50-60 minutes
Ingredients:
*Also known as glutinous rice flour (which is gluten free), sticky rice flour, or mochiko.
Directions:
Note: Using an electric mixer is recommended.

Netflix kicked off 2019 with a new series, Tidying Up with Marie Kondo. Organizing consultant Marie Kondo walks through her signature KonMari method in different American households, a method partially inspired by the Shinto religion that requires gathering all items within a certain category and keeping only those that “spark joy.” Earlier this month, Kondo helped Stephen Colbert tidy up his desk on his show.
Kondo has enjoyed massive success as an Internet darling who has inspired many to reconsider their current possessions and their future purchase decisions. However, she has received her fair share of criticism, some unfortunately predicated on racist beliefs. American political activist and journalist Barbara Ehrenreich posted, in a now-deleted tweet, that “I will be convinced that America is not in decline only when our de-cluttering guru Marie Kondo learns to speak English,” a clear jab at Kondo speaking Japanese on her Netflix show. Ehrenreich later clarified that “I confess: I hate Marie Kondo because, aesthetically speaking, I’m on the side of clutter. As for her language: It’s OK with me that she doesn’t speak English to her huge American audience but it does suggest that America is in decline as a superpower.” Not only are these claims outwardly racist, such messages also imply that other cultures are not welcome in America. In a heterogeneous culture like that of the U.S., it is especially disheartening to see that someone with such a platform can believe that one culture is inherently superior to another and has nothing to gain from learning about another’s. Kondo contributes a personal philosophy that was crafted from her background and unique experiences. It’s safe to say that hubris does not spark joy nor productivity; let’s propose to — as Kondo would say — dispose of it.
Even some compliments made towards Kondo have been backhanded, painting her as ethereal or as something that “exists in an art gallery, waiting room or mausoleum.” Although these may not have been made with racist intentions, they are degrading and fall into the stereotype that Asian women are submissive and exotic creatures. There’s no denying that Kondo is charming and comforting, but reducing her to such superficial qualities is to fail to recognize her as an individual woman who wants to share her passion in self-improvement.
Regardless, Kondo’s presence in the public sphere and overall message seems to have come at a perfect time. People are becoming more aware of the impacts of consumerism, leading to a wave of minimalism and anti-consumerism. “Declutters,” where people curate their material collections, seem to be trending online. Millennials, who comprise about a quarter of the total U.S. population and most of the workforce, are especially compelled to embrace a more minimalist lifestyle for various reasons. Growing awareness of materialism and its environmental impacts, placing more value on experiences than material items, economic factors, and more all contribute to millennials’ general tendency to be more cognizant in their purchasing patterns. As millennials gain more societal influence, it appears Kondo and KonMari are both here to stay.
Am I encouraging you all to donate half your possessions and survive only on the clothes on your back? Of course not. Neither is Kondo. She discourages arbitrarily getting rid of items for the sole reason of reducing clutter. Even she understands that people find that some level of clutter does, as she would say, “spark joy.” The message she is sending is about being more cognizant about mindless spending and accumulation of material goods. I think we can all relate to making impulse decisions that ultimately end up leaving us with yet another dust collector. Through her work, Kondo inspires others to be more aware of what they own and be happier with it, ensuring that whatever they add to their lives truly adds value. That’s a lesson that all of us can benefit from.

After settling into life at Carnegie Mellon over the past two and a half years, I wanted to learn more about the city that has come to be my home. As students, we mostly stay in the familiar parts of Pittsburgh — Oakland, Squirrel Hill, Shadyside. Perhaps some will venture to the South Side to go shopping, or Downtown for cultural events, but there are many eclectic neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, from Bloomfield to the Strip District to Polish Hill. Recently, I decided to explore the Mexican War Streets of the North Side.
Mexican War Streets? When I first heard the unique name of this historic district, I was surprised and confused. Why would this be the name of a series of residential streets in the North Side? It turns out that there isn’t really a compelling or interesting reason why. More simply, why not?
In the 1840s, as Pittsburgh continued to grow, General William Robinson developed this area, calling it Buena Vista and named the streets after prominent places and people of the Mexican-American War, which was raging on at the time. Robinson was the son of James Robinson, who is considered the first settler of the North Side.
Today, the Mexican War Streets make up a small area of Pittsburgh compared to other regions of the city. It’s simply a row of parallel streets and another of perpendicular ones. In its northern corners, it is framed by two famous art centers, the Mattress Factory and Randyland. It has a Commonplace Coffee at a street corner, but every other building is a townhouse. They vary in architectural styles, but are consistently colorful and unique. Some are red with yellow trim, others have symmetrical purple doors, and some are made of intimidating stone.
Beyond the two museums, there isn’t much “activity” in the Mexican War Streets per se. You’ll see families walking around, or people taking their dogs out, sure. But for someone like me who loves to know the history of how unique things came to be, it was great to simply walk around on a quiet, cloudy winter day and explore.

Last week I ranted about Hollywood and the Oscars. This week I’m going to talk about an even more dirty industry. This industry is so sleazy, lazy, and fake that it makes Hollywood look like professionals. It’s an industry so shallow and devoid of meaning at this point that it is insulting to even call it art.
I’m referring to, of course, the music industry.
As per usual, the yearly popularity contest known as the Grammys are here and I am not watching it. There is no reason to, as there is nothing to get excited about. At least with the Oscars, there are always two movies or a few awards you care about. For this one, there really are none, because the ones you do care about mostly don’t show up in the actual televised event. The awards are all just based on who had the most listeners rather than an actual, curated pick of the year’s best music, interspersed with live performances that tend to be very lackluster.
Anyone with half a brain will know that the music industry isn’t about the music. It’s all about marketing. The most popular music that is on the radio for the most part isn’t music anymore. It’s just a cookie cutter, corporate, board-approved collection of computer noises and autotuned voices with any modicum of creativity left on the audio engineer’s floor. The Grammy’s Record of the Year and Album of the Year awards are representative of this, with a huge number of the songs representing everything wrong with the music industry.
That’s not to say there aren’t some good songs nominated this year. Naturally, the Black Panther soundtrack got a lot of well-deserved nominations for some good tracks. Childish Gambino’s “This is America” is fine but not memorable enough to warrant being picked for a top award by a supposedly prestigious institution. But there isn’t much else of note. All the popular music that came out this year was really lame for the most part. Once again, it’s just whatever had the most amount of air time on the radio or the highest number of total listeners. When will people realize that Drake is a hack with no flow or style? “God’s Plan” is not a good song, and Drake has been irrelevant since Pusha T released that diss track.
It’s also weird that there even is an award for deciding the best overall song of the year (instead of Song of the Year, which is about songwriting). That’s practically impossible. At least with film, you can compare filmmaking craft amongst genres and choose the best film of the year. I don’t think that’s even possible with music. You could compare composition, but most songs nominated for the top categories aren’t compositionally interesting. It’s obviously a celebration of which record label marketed their songs the best. Let’s also talk about the fact that there a shocking number of artists who should have nominations but never received one, such as Talking Heads, The Velvet Underground, The Strokes, Janis Joplin, The Who, and even The Spice Girls.
Overall, the Grammys are an absolute joke and no one should take them seriously. It’s obvious that most people don’t. The music industry is a sham and most of the music nominated for the big awards are songs that people usually dance to. It’s a shame that there is no genuine show that exists to celebrate the best of what music has to offer. There are some amazing artists out there putting out creative content like Robyn, Earl Sweatshirt, Brockhampton, King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, Melody Echo’s Chamber, and Blood Orange. But they get no recognition from the self-important music industry. I suppose it’s for the best. If they did recognize any talent, they would sanitize it and turn it into a shell of its former self.

Carnegie Mellon PhD student Aayush Bansal is teaching computers how to imagine. Working with professors Deva Ramanan and Yaser Sheikh of the Robotics Institute, Bansal recently developed an algorithm which has made a splash in both academic and mainstream media. His method, titled Recycle-GAN, autonomously transfers the contents of one video to another, while making sure that the style of the target is retained. For example: imagine watching a video of Donald Trump speaking, in which his mannerisms, voice, and facial movements are those of Barack Obama. Or a time-lapse rose blooming in the style of an azalea. This is all possible with Recycle-GAN.
The approach combines the functions of two recent AI projects, OpenPose and Cycle-GAN, to track the movement of key points from one video and transfer that movement to the image in a similar video. The project’s website shows the final product on multiple different videos, with original footage next to the retargeted footage of people speaking, flowers blooming, sunrises, origami birds flying, and robotic arms picking up objects.
Prior work in this field has been aimed specifically at facial retargeting, but Bansal’s research team has broadened the applications of the technology. “We aren’t using any specific facial information,” he explained from his desk in Smith Hall, which is littered with philosophy books and Disney-Pixar posters. “We just wanted to see if we could automatically learn the video retargeting or not.”
Video retargeting is not new technology — Hollywood has been doing it for more than 20 years. Animators in Furious 7 created a digital version of Paul Walker, who died before they finished shooting the movie. But until now, tasks like that required a team of artists. With Recycle-GAN and programs like it, virtually anybody can generate retargeted videos — the code is freely available on GitHub.
For some, this is cause for worry. In April 2018, BuzzFeed released a video of Jordan Peele’s now famous “deepfake” video showing a convincingly-rendered Barack Obama saying a number of things the actual Obama probably never would. Peele’s video warned the public that deepfakes are a threat to reliable information, prompting a recently released CNN investigation titled “the Pentagon’s Race Against Deepfakes,” which summarized the history of video augmentation and the current research on both generating and detecting fabricated audiovisual content.
Bansal’s research was mentioned in the report, and though he resents the term “deepfake,” he made his opinions clear on the topic: “Whenever a user is looking at a video, she or he should know if it’s a real or generated content. We should beable to tell people if it’s a real video or fake.” His Recycle-GAN algorithm can help researchers working on deepfake detection methods by generating data for them: instead of paying a team of highly-skilled digital artists to make a retargeted video, researchers could just pass two clips into his algorithm and generate their fakes in a matter of minutes.
The key to this kind of technology is an old idea but a fairly new research topic: artificial imagination. “If you can’t collect data, create it,” joked Bansal. One of his earlier projects involved taking a black-and-white, unshaded outline of a stiletto heel and uploading its visual data to an AI program that generates several different colorized and shaded sketches of what that shoe could look like. This task might be easy for a human; every time we read a description or see a black-and-white photo, our imagination creates a more complete image for us. For a computer, however, this process is complicated: the program must accept an incomplete signal and generate multiple plausible outputs from it.
This technology has implications far beyond  deepfake videos. Bansal imagines a future where programs like Recycle-GAN will be able to create data which can’t be captured. Self-driving cars, for instance, mostly have accidents when it is dark, rainy, or misty, because their sensors have trouble interpreting visual data in these settings. “We could use a lot of data from good weather conditions to try and simulate data for bad weather conditions,” he offered. Another potential use includes documentation: if several different people film the same event from different locations, retargeting algorithms could potentially stitch the separate 2-D footage together to create a 3-D virtual reality version of the event.
Bansal’s personal hopes for the technology’s future lie in entertainment. “I have a fascination with animation,” he said, adding that he wants this technology to make the animation process quicker and easier for companies like Pixar and Dreamworks, so that more stories can be created. “Storytellers shouldn’t have to worry about how their stories will be told,” he said, “I’ve always thought that people’s ideas are just sitting on the shelf because they don’t have sufficient resources to make them.”
Whether those ideas are safer autonomous cars, more accurate video evidence, false videos of someone saying things they never said, or the next Disney-Pixar blockbuster, one thing is certain: Recycle-GAN will make the road to creation much easier.

In response to a stark increase of hate crimes and Anti-Semitism, the FBI asked for the community’s help to prevent future hate crimes in the Pittsburgh area.
The Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh hosted four FBI agents at the Rodef Shalom Congregation on Fifth Avenue in a forum this past month about indicators of extremism and hate crimes. Rather than talk about the Tree of Life shooting, they were focused on empowering members of the community to identify and report dangerous behavior to stop hate crimes before they happen.
“We’ve never seen or heard from the Ku Klux Klan, until three or four weeks ago,” said Brad Orsini, director of Jewish community security for the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh. He held up a ziplock bag containing literature from the KKK. This was one of many that had been distributed throughout Squirrel Hill in recent months. Birdseed was also present in the bags, reportedly to prevent the packages blowing away.
Orsini encouraged citizens to call 911 immediately upon coming across such material. He urged citizens not to post them on social media or open the packages. “We want a proper police response to identify each and every place these are set.”
The FBI agents distinguished between hate speech and hate crimes at the forum. “This is not illegal,” explained Agent Pulscaro, gesturing towards the distributed KKK pamphlets. The pamphlets are technically hate speech, which is protected by the First Amendment. However, the FBI agents emphasized that reporting hate speech is critical to prevent hate crimes, and citizens’ right to report is also protected by the First Amendment. Agent Matt Trosman added that “everything has intelligence value” in matters as consequential as this.
“We need those puzzle pieces to put together the picture,” stated Trosman. He encouraged community members to photograph and report any hate speech they might see. “We can’t be everywhere, we can’t see everything, so, [prevention] starts with you,” he said.
A recent FBI study found that 51 active shooters from 2000 to 2013 had declared their intent to engage in violence online or to colleagues. 54 percent of those who observed this hate speech did nothing. Of those who were alarmed enough to act, 83 percent communicated only with the soon-to-be shooter.
The FBI has seen a shift in extremism, from the fringes of society to the mainstream. They are not just recruiting “typical skinheads,” but college educated people.
“Statistically, we’re talking about white men,” said Agent Melissa Moore. Yet, she explained that it is important not to generalize and to pay attention to behavioral indicators. 
Potential active shooters often espouse a “grievance narrative” against an entire group, praise past attacks and have a history of, or fascination with, violence.
Agent La Salle Burka showed a third-grade report card of the Pulse nightclub shooter, Omar Mateen. It described Mateen as prone to “verbally abusive, aggressive behavior.”
The FBI agents showed the most common logos of white supremacist groups. The Othala rune, an antiquated Viking symbol, is being used in place of the swastika. The Nazi symbol has reportedly become too identifiable.
“The internet has created a way for people to access information without any group affiliation,” emphasized Agent Moore. The agents emphasized that the FBI can only search online for dangerous and offensive material if it has been reported to them. Additionally, it is important that alarmed citizens take a screenshot of hateful material they come across before reporting it. Hateful material is often removed shortly after it has been posted, they stated.
Agents Trosman and Pulcatro emphasized resisting the urge to debate or engage with people who post hate-speech on social media, since “it is not worth putting [yourself] at risk of harassment, violence, or doxing,” each common tactics by hate groups.
“Take your community back,” urged Agent Pulcastro. “Don’t tolerate it, report it.”

Last semester, a Campus Lighting Pre-Investigation Paper (PIP) was presented to the Senate’s general body regarding the lack of outdoor lighting on campus. After the PIP was approved by the Senate, the Campus Life Committee took it upon themselves to investigate the problem.
Last week, we met with the Carnegie Mellon administration to inform them of the problem with the lack of lighting. This benefits the undergraduate population because it will hopefully provide more lighting all around campus, making it a nicer and safer place to walk at night. This PIP was inspired by a student suggestion that the campus felt unsafe at night. Actions will hopefully come into effect soon after the proposal is presented.
Additionally, Carnegie Mellon President Farnam Jahanian is coming to Senate’s General Body Meeting next Thursday. He will be joining the members of Senate to discuss topics relating to school administration and what has been accomplished so far this school year. President Jahanian will be presenting things from his perspective on different important topics affecting students and the campus as a whole.
The meeting will serve as an opportunity to learn what the role of university president means, ask questions about what President Jahanian has been working on, and possibly even suggest ideas that you may have about aspects of the university that the president has control over. This is a public, annual event, so feel free to stop by the Danforth Conference Room located on the second floor of the Cohon University Center this coming Thursday to participate in the conversation. There will be food!

Last Thursday, it was announced that Dr. Larry Pileggi, longtime Carnegie Mellon researcher and professor, was going to be the new Dean of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, effective Mar. 2019.
Pileggi, who received his doctorate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon in 1989, has earned several distinctions throughout his career: the announcement press release notes that Pileggi, “an innovative researcher,” has “published more than 350 conference and journal papers and holds 40 U.S. patents.”
In addition to this, Pileggi has received awards for his developments in integrated circuit design, secure hardware, and power systems research, with a Presidential Young Investigator award from the National Science Foundation, a Semiconductor Research Corporation Aristotle award, and Westinghouse Corporation’s highest engineering achievement award, among several others.
Outside of the classroom, he’s also a renowned poker player: last year, he finished in the “top three percent” of contestants at the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas, walking away with earnings of over 30 thousand dollars.
The department Pileggi is inheriting is one of both great prestige and continued growth. Currently, U.S. News and World Reports ranks both the graduate and undergraduate Electrical and Computer Engineering programs as among the top ten best in the world, with the undergraduate Computer Engineering program ranking first globally.
His predecessor, Dean Jelena Kovačević, “did an outstanding job and left us in excellent shape,” Pileggi told The Tartan in an interview. He continued, “we also have significant faculty leadership and excellent staff within the department, who along with the interim department head James Hoe, were able to keep things running smoothly during the department head search process.”
According to Pileggi, some of the greatest challenges facing the department are the difficulties of adapting to and integrating “online learning tools with material and videos covering every problem and topic.” With material that is “always advancing and evolving,” Pileggi says that keeping up with “the changing landscapes” of the field including machine learning and artificial intelligence research will be a major test for the department.
Regardless, the “roots” of the department, which centers upon the importance of applied research “mostly driven by the needs of industry and defense,” will not be changing anytime soon. Since the “founding [of the engineering school] as Carnegie Tech for the training of persons from the local industry,” these industry-and defense-driven roots run deep.
The growing intersection between technology, society, and business has also been a driver in development at Carnegie Mellon for years, with the Tepper Quadrangle having opened this year, and the recent partnership between CIT and the Army Research Laboratory. Pileggi echoes this sentiment: “it is quite apparent that the next few decades will be focused on research that is to advance specific applications and societal/defense needs.”
Pileggi describes the Electrical and Computer Engineering department as having “seen evolution and trends over the past 100 years for Electrical Engineering,” so it is no surprise that he is optimistic about their future. In the coming days, he is “hoping to announce some exciting changes in the not too distant future, where we build upon our solid base to aim for even higher heights.”

Winter this year was unexpectedly harsh, bringing record-breaking low temperatures and at least 20 casualties throughout the American Midwest. Caused by the breakdown of the polar vortex, as a result of climate change, the sudden cold snap ground entire states to a halt and trapped people within their homes, while those without shelter were left at the mercy of the elements.
Here on campus, students were spared the cold thanks to the cancellation of classes on Jan. 30, and Jan. 31. A few hours before announcing the decision, the university sent out an email to all students about taking precautions against the extreme cold, making it seem that classes would be still be held despite the weather. This email stoked fears of confronting the ungodly temperatures, so students banded together and created an online petition appropriately titled “Cancel Class on Wednesday” that garnered nearly 3,500 signatures, equivalent to around half of the undergraduate class.
Regardless of whether the petition had any influence on the outcome, it does show that when we, the students, want something to change, we can come together and try to make it happen. It might be an exaggeration to brand an online petition as a prime example of student activism, but at the very least, people took the time out of their day to make their voices heard. In the end, signing an online petition supporting the cancellation of classes is still a step above just privately complaining to friends or ranting on Facebook, but it was a small action that sparked some significant meaning.
This raises the question: what else do students have the power to change?
College campuses have historically been more liberal and politically active than the general populous, with students often rallying around causes they believe in. The 20th century alone is rife with examples of students rising up and making a difference: from backing the Civil Rights Movement to protesting the Vietnam War to fighting against the political status quo, college students of the past were not afraid to speak out against what they saw as corrupt or morally wrong. Today, activism is more important than ever, especially given the present escalation in issues such as gun violence, political polarization and corruption, racism and intolerance, and economic inequality. With the advent of the internet and continued growth of social media, speaking out against something is easier than ever, and it is crucial for us to consider how we may leverage towards positive societal change.
We have seen the power of student advocacy in the past as well. In 2016, students and professors helped 80 CulinArt workers who were part of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) to raise their wages from $13.35 to $16.75, allowing the workers to earn wages that were on par with workers in nearby universities like the University of Pittsburgh and Duquesne University and lead more comfortable lives. Because there were students and professors who cared enough for the employees that help run the university, the union was able to gain enough power to create a new contract for these workers.
Does that mean you should go out right now and start a protest over any nationally controversial issue? Not necessarily; Carnegie Mellon does not have as impressive a legacy of student activism as other universities. Rather, we should begin with the problems immediately afflicting our campus and our community.
Anyone can see that our university has its fair share of issues, from the continuous cycle of constructing and removing the massive tents for orientation and major campus events that leave behind ugly fields of mud, the mistreatment of food workers by Chartwells, Carnegie Mellon’s food contractor; the ethical questions surrounding the increased collaboration between the Department of Defense and the university on projects such as the AI Task Force, and the displacement of local residents through continued acquisition of nearby apartment buildings.
No matter what your perspective may be on these various issues, it does not change the fact that students have both the power and responsibility to hold the university accountable for its actions and to foster a better community both on and off campus. Solving these problems may seem daunting, and it will likely require more than just an online petition, but that does not mean we shouldn’t try. One person griping about rising tuition rates might not make much of a difference, but a well-organized group of a few thousand is certainly a force to be reckoned with. If we, as a student body, collectively make it clear that we want scholarships to meet full demonstrated need instead of trying to pad our endowment, we may be able to better influence decision makers.
Banding together and acting in unison might sound like a lot of work, but the payoff far exceeds the cost. Not only could we change Carnegie Mellon for the better and leave an indelible mark on our institution, but we could extend beyond our campus and impact the world. We should begin establishing a tradition of student activism, because as idealistic and cliché as it may sound, we must be the change we wish to see, and working together is the best way to move towards a brighter future.

I decided to take a break from the news for a while, so I ended up missing out on all the drama about the longest government shutdown in history. But I figured that the best way to get back into politics and news was to watch the State of the Union address. Let’s just say that there is a lot to break down.
The members of Congress chanting “USA” over and over was something out of a George Orwell novel. That’s what the whole speech felt like: an Orwellian sociopath emotionally manipulating Americans into believing loads of nonsense. He mixed the truth with lies and alternated between fear-mongering and celebrating “progress” to make himself sound legitimate. 
There was an obvious inconsistency between Trump’s normal rhetoric and his rhetoric during his speech. He championed bipartisan politics right after a shutdown that was nothing but pure partisan politics and after insulting Chuck Schumer at a private event just hours before the address. He was clearly muzzled by whoever wrote his speech. It lacked more substance than usual. 
Unsurprisingly, he made a lot of exaggerated claims during the speech. He exaggerated the job growth under his tenure, with more realistic estimates hovering around 4.9 million jobs being added and 454,000 manufacturing jobs, a stark contrast compared to Trump’s claim of 5.3 million jobs with 600,000 manufacturing jobs. Economic growth isn’t faster than ever. It’s fine, but it isn’t the massive accomplishment Trump makes it out to be since the growth began during Obama’s tenure. Of course, saying all of this doesn’t matter much. He always exaggerates his claims anyway, so it’s nothing new. What amazed me was how he just sprinkled in enough things he has actually done to make it seem like there has been improvement when there hasn’t been. It only goes to show just how much he treats the presidency and the country’s issues as a mere sales pitch, and many Americans are unfortunately buying it. 
Another thing I found to be quite hilarious was how he switched between topics. After fear-mongering about immigrants for at least ten minutes, he went into a brief tangent about female representation in Congress. Of course, everyone stood up and clapped when that happened, and then proceeded to chant "USA" right after. It just blew my mind, and it was representative of everything wrong about the speech. It was all just a mere distraction. Of course, it’s wrong for him to do that, but it was more frustrating to watch the crowd play into his tactics. And it only gives him more ammunition to defend himself against criticisms. 
In fact, his whole speech is designed in a way to be able to deflect criticism, and it’s very much a strategy used by conservatives like Ben Shapiro. For example, with abortion, he made the issue about the right of innocent life and killing babies rather than about women’s choice. With illegal immigration, he made it an issue of the rare instances of undocumented immigrants killing American citizens. Of course, when he turns those respective topics into the issue, it will force everyone to confront the specifics of what he says rather than real problems. It doesn’t matter that late-term abortions aren’t allowed under current law unless the fetus is not viable or a danger to the mother or the fact that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit crime and that fencing has not worked. When the issue at hand is about death or some other sensitive topic, it makes any discussion surrounding his claims difficult and will make anyone who questions him seem callous. 
In all honesty, it’s hard to talk about this State of the Union speech. It’s not new for Trump to lie or hide veiled threats in his speeches. It’s not like Trump said anything blatantly outrageous. In fact, the tempered discussion of his usual rhetoric made him seem almost reasonable. The problem is that this clearly fools a lot of people. He will make himself seem “normal” on these sorts of occasions to normalize whatever he likes to talk about. 
The Democrats have a tough challenge ahead of them if they want any hope of getting elected. Trump knows how to sell his rhetoric, even if it’s all empty. It’s an embarrassing situation all around, and it’s going to be a long, twisted, annoying, frustrating, anger-inducing road to the 2020 elections.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, known as AOC, is taking the nation by storm. From taking a stand on the broken system to making the complexities of American politics more accessible through viral C-SPAN videos and Instagram stories, Ocasio-Cortez is a disruptive tour-de-force, the voice of a generation ready to take action. We are just as ready and eager for her as we are completely terrified.
I understand that her politics are not the easiest to swallow. Her political stances are not sugar-coated phrases repeated over and over like a broken record: Ocasio-Cortez is actively fighting for a Green New Deal, a 70 percent marginal tax rate on those earning over $10 million a year, abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and establishing Medicare for All. With our current political climate, criticism of Ocasio-Cortez is almost a given.
However, I cannot turn the other cheek when critics attack her clothes, home life, and even her dance moves. The political right almost obsessively nitpicks every one of Ocasio-Cortez’s “flaws.” While I can agree that part of her rise to social media fame is the comebacks she tweets in response to her critics, which fuel more backlash from conservatives, I cannot help but look beyond the Twitter fights and see a larger problem at play: when people of color — let alone women of color — enter elite spaces, they’re often attacked as undeserving or unqualified. 
Most of the attacks Ocasio-Cortez has faced over the past few months fall under the umbrella of conservatives questioning her working-class background. From spending the majority of her young life in Westchester County rather than the Bronx, to her daring to wear a black blazer for her Congressional orientation because her clothes “don’t look like a girl who struggles”, she has been critiqued over almost everything. It is even worse considering that most of the headlines coming of these “discoveries” involve reporters going out of their way to find photos of her home, “leaking” videos of her dancing as a college student and taking pictures of her without her knowledge. This lack of respect is jarring, but the worst part is perhaps the fact that these reporters want to depict her as a liar. Naturally, if Ocasio-Cortez is a liar, she does not deserve to represent NY-14. 
Yet, not once has Ocasio-Cortez hidden that she did not grow up in the Bronx; if anything, she actively recognizes her privilege. According to Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign website, “It was clear to her, even then, that the zip code a child was born in determined much of their destiny. The 40-minute drive represented a vastly different quality of available schooling, economic opportunity, and health outcomes.”
While she did not grow up in the streets of the Bronx, she did work and spend much of her childhood visiting family there. Ocasio-Cortez has made it clear that she intends to fight for the people of NY-14, and her ability to do so should not be dramatically altered by the fact that she went to Boston University or that she grew up in the suburbs. 
Another spate of criticism comes from the fact that Ocasio-Cortez is a young woman. Despite the fact that Republican Paul Ryan was around the same age as Ocasio-Cortez when he was elected into the House of Representatives, a Fox News guest had the nerve to call her  a “little girl.” Kellyanne Conway, Counselor to the President, referred to her as a “congresswoman who doesn’t seem to know much about anything.” These comments are the product of an intense double standard in not only politics but also any area work traditionally dominated by men, especially older men. Lastly, there is a need to prove her as unqualified for the position as representative, especially a position that, in our society, she was not supposed to have.
Overall, the criticisms thrown at Ocasio-Cortez everyday are a combination of deeply ingrained sexism and racism, as well as complete and utter fear. Naturally, Republicans are terrified of the quasi-celebrity politician, of the Latina from New York with enough spunk to inspire an entire generation and the charisma of a natural politician. Ocasio-Cortez’s existence, along with the rest of the inspiring, diverse 116th Congress, is a statement of our changing society, yet I can’t help but ask if simple representation is enough to challenge deeply rooted stigmas and stereotypes.
Whether at Carnegie Mellon University or the United States House of Representatives, people of color deal with the burden of constantly having to prove themselves in elite institutions — for now, at least. It is an ordeal that can never be put properly into words, but in Ocasio-Cortez’s case, I am relieved that she knows that she deserves to represent New York’s 14th District and that she, herself, worked for her office on Capitol Hill. While her resilience does not erase the amount of empty criticisms she receives on the daily, it does make them all seem futile. 
From one Latina to another: muchos éxitos, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

In 2014, then-17-year-old Michelle Carter made headlines for sending texts to her long-distance boyfriend Conrad Roy, 18, that encouraged him to kill himself by carbon monoxide poisoning. The text exchanges published show that on June 6, just a week before the suicide, Carter helped Roy conjure up a concrete plan to die by suicide in the most discreet way possible. On June 13, the day of the suicide, Roy expressed second thoughts before attempting, but Carter encouraged him to stop "push[ing the suicide] off" and to "do it."
On Feb. 4, 2015, Carter was indicted, and the case was allowed to move forward. That year, Carter evoked some strong emotions on social media. Just two days before the indictment, she took to Twitter to post a photo of Roy telling him to "enjoy the parade from up there tomorrow" and that she was "[r]eally missing you tonight." Although the judge's order banned Carter from using social media, her mother shared photos of Carter going to school competitions, attending her senior prom, and going to Disney World on her behalf. Becki Maki, Roy's aunt, expressed her distress by saying “It’s really hard because we don’t have our nephew in our lives anymore. We will never see him enjoy these milestones...He’ll never see his sisters go to prom, and to see her awaiting her manslaughter trial on a trip to Disney World with her friends, going to school competitions and going off to prom — it just seems like she doesn’t understand the gravity of the actions that have led to the case against her.” Now, Carter is sentenced to 15 months in prison for involuntary manslaughter, a stark contrast to the maximum of 20 years that once hung over her head.
Exact motives have not been made explicit. In court, psychiatrist and critic of psychiatric medicines, Peter Breggin, testified to the court that Carter's history of taking antidepressants caused her to be "involuntarily intoxicated" by the medication. "She is not forming the criminal intent... She's found a way to use her unique power to help and to help this boyfriend — in her mind but not in his — to not keep making mistakes and not keep hurting himself."
It is important to realize that medicine is not the right treatment for everyone. Psychiatric medication is a controversial topic, even among those in the field. Some patients react better than others, and anybody using medication should be monitored to ensure their safety. Many factors — chemistry, family history, a person's specific needs, to list a few — can cause drastically different results from person to person. That's true for basically any medical procedure, and psychiatric medication is no exception. Current science shows that antidepressants have potential side effects, one of them being increased suicidal ideation. Therefore, it's possible that Carter had an adverse reaction to antidepressants. 
That being said, Breggin has been outspoken against psychiatric medicines for decades. Breggin's words reflect a dangerous trend we see in automatically linking mental illnesses with tragedies. Of course, the psychological state one was in during a certain situation is important to consider, but depression does not cause manslaughter. Antidepressants aren't some evil psyche-changing substances that manipulate people into violent behavior. Placing the blame on medication that over one in ten Americans rely on to go about their daily lives is not only a careless conclusion to make but also dangerous. The fact that a psychiatrist who was educated in prestigious institutions and has practiced in the field for decades claimed this in court can serve as further validation for those who carry this mentality.
Additionally, Breggin never actually treated Carter. His conclusions have been drawn from remote speculations, not from directly working with her. Breggins claims that psychiatric medication flipped Carter from being a compassionate "helper" to being "apathetic." Carter began taking antidepressants in 2011, and the couple met in 2012. In the beginning of the relationship, Carter actually encouraged Roy to seek professional help. Between then and the incident, there was no change in medication prior to the incident, so for effects to kick in three years after beginning a medication is rather unlikely. If antidepressants were the sole reason for Carter's change in personality, her change should not have occurred during the relationship.
However, Carter's response to the suicide makes room for a completely different possible intent. After encouraging Roy to die by suicide, she didn't call authorities or even reach out for help. Prosecutor Maryclare Flynn argued that Carter wanted sympathy for being the "grieving girlfriend."
There's no concrete evidence for Flynn's claim. However, past social media activity isn't necessarily helping Carter's case. Although she expressed remorse to her friends — allegedly claiming she herself "chickened out" of attempting suicide — the fact that she continued life as usual by completing her high school career, going to Disney World, and going to tanning salons all after the incident is a bit unnerving. Additionally, there is speculation that she took inspiration from a show she enjoyed, Glee. Parallels between quotes from Lea Michele — both on and off camera — have been made to Carter's words in response to Roy's death. "[Michele's] just been my inspiration and stuff lately I love her haha," Carter told her friend. Glee was a show that she admired. This has led people to question her motives behind pressuring Roy to kill himself or the authenticity of her mourning.
Regardless of intent, Carter undeniably preyed on Roy's vulnerability. Would Roy be alive today if someone had called for help? It's difficult to say. Both Roy and Carter struggled with mental health and needed further care, and Roy had experienced suicidal thoughts leading up to the event. However, Carter may have been the final catalyst who pushed him to end his life, and until we have a cure for such psychiatric illnesses, we must remain vigilant in treating those who are suffering.

Last week, The Tartan reported on Carnegie Mellon's latest partnership with the U.S. military, the Army AI Task Force. As the article states, “the Army AI Task Force represents only the most recent chapter in a 70-year history of Carnegie Mellon working with the Department of Defense.” Nevertheless, this is a particularly outrageous chapter, and the justifications for it are deceptive and inhumane.
In support of the Task Force, Army Futures Commander General John Murray says that “the ‘character of war’ continues to evolve,” citing “quantum computing, ventures into space, directed energy, AI, and machine learning.” He predicts that very soon, “artificial intelligence will be ‘in everything, and everywhere.’”
In this way, General Murray seems to portray technological change as a natural force that humans don’t cause and couldn’t possibly redirect. In fact, the U.S. military has intentionally brought AI into war, dumping military funding into related technical areas. Their strategy has been to incentivize engineers and scientists at universities like Carnegie Mellon to work for war profiteers, to coax them into ignoring their conscience even as people everywhere, including in this country, are increasingly skeptical of the U.S.'s status as “leader of the free world.”
The U.S. military is currently occupying or bombing seven countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa, and it maintains special operations forces in over 100 others. It provides weapons, targeting assistance, and diplomatic support to the human rights-abusing regime of Saudi Arabia even as that government carries out a genocide in Yemen and regularly locks up and executes activists and dissidents from its own country. Right now, the U.S. military is threatening undemocratic regime change in Venezuela and Iran. To be clear, this is the institution that Carnegie Mellon's AI Task Force is supporting.
According to General Murray, the Carnegie Mellon-Army partnership will both “make our soldiers and units of the future more effective,” and “better yet” create a situation where “there will be nobody in the world who will challenge [the U.S.].” The General’s first point is a typical canard of pro-war discourse: even if you disagree with U.S. foreign policy, you should support any decision that “helps the troops.” We should reject this framing. The central issue is not the soldiers and units, but the policies they are carrying out: coups, bombings, and other acts of unprovoked violence. Why should we want such policies made “more effective”?
With his second point, General Murray betrays a desire for total U.S. domination. But we have seen, since 9/11, how U.S. occupation of regions like the Middle East has not brought ordinary people great benefits — to put it mildly. Globally, income and wealth inequality are increasing. Climate change and environmental degradation are accelerating. Migration crises, horrible in their own right, are creating political space for rising fascist movements in Europe, Asia, South America, and elsewhere. This is how things stand now, with the massive U.S. military encircling the globe, commanding advanced weaponry that our closest competitors could hardly dream of. Does it seem just to give the military even more power?
Discussing advances in AI, Secretary of the Army Mark T. Esper argues that “whoever gets there first” will be given a “decisive edge on the battlefield for years to come.” Again, this implies that changes in technology are simply occurring somewhere “out there” in the wild, with the Army’s technologists “discovering” them. In reality, U.S. leaders are actively fostering these changes in a race to the bottom with similarly militaristic war planners in China and Russia.
We don’t have to approach the issue that way. After decades of bloody proxy wars, it was direct negotiations that ended the Cold War with the Soviet Union in 1989. If negotiations had been more consistent, it may have ended much sooner. In his second term, President Obama’s administration held direct talks with Iran, a country that President Bush had relegated to the “Axis of Evil.” The result of Obama’s diplomacy was a multilateral agreement that made the world safer. If the U.S. wants to prevent AI from being used by China or Russia, it should work cooperatively with these and other world powers on a global AI weapons ban.
Instead, even our very own university president, Farnam Jahanian, is committed to war over diplomacy and negotiations. The Tartan reports that President Jahanian “excitedly stated ‘Carnegie Mellon stands ready to assist the Army.’” This is unacceptable. The President did not seek the input of students, faculty, or staff before proffering this view on our behalf — or indeed, before committing Carnegie Mellon to the Army AI Task Force itself.
For our part, SDS members stand ready to hold the U.S. military accountable and check its power at our university. When President Jahanian states that AI military applications “benefit society,” we strongly disagree. Any Task Force designed to keep the U.S. at war forever, dominating and controlling the world, is anathema to democracy, peace, and social justice.
