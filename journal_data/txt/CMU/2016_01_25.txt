Men’s Cross Country
Coming into the season with new head coach Timothy Connelly, the Carnegie Mellon men’s cross country team had a lot of questions about what direction the program would take, a year after winning NCAA Regionals and placing 24th at NCAA DIII Nationals.The team made a statement in Connelly’s first year, winning the UAA Championships in cross country for the first time in 10 years on the way to an 18th place finish at nationals, a six place improvement from the year before. Helped by one of the deepest rosters in recent history and great performances by junior runner Ryan Archer, the Tartans established themselves as the team to beat in the conference.
Football
The Carnegie Mellon football team got off to a slow start, dropping an important conference game to Washington University in St. Louis on their way to a 1–3 record through the first four games. The season looked to be in trouble, even though sophomore running back Sam Benger managed over 200 yards rushing in two of three losses.
Benger’s statistical contributions didn’t stay out of the box score for long, with the Tartan men breaking out of their slump to win their next four games by 21, 44, 28, and 54 points before entering their next UAA contest. There, the Carnegie men turned heads with a 52–7 lights-out performance to take care of business with the visiting University of Chicago Maroons.
This paved the way to a conference showdown with rival No. 22 ranked Case Western Reserve University for the UAA Conference title. The Tartans carried their momentum into the contest, and held on for a tight 52–42 result. With a midseason turnaround, a strong defense, and an unstoppable offense the Carnegie men took their first conference championship in 10 years and went on to win the ECAC Legacy Bowl to put a stamp on the end of their season.
Four players were named to the D3football.com All-American team, the first Carnegie football players to be recognized as such since 2006.
Men’s Soccer
Looking to make a mark with a competitive lineup entering the season, the Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team came out scoring to open up the 2015 season. Going 7–1–1, including a 4–3 win over #3 ranked Messiah in September, the Tartan men positioned themselves as contenders entering UAA competition.
The Tartans entered their final conference matchup against Case Western Reserve University with a 3–1–2 record in conference play. Through an evenly matched and tightly contested game, the Spartans eventually came away with the win off of a late goal in double overtime. The Tartans took the loss, but still managed a third place finish in the UAA going into the NCAA tournament.
The Tartans’ tournament run ended up being a short one, as leading scorer and senior midfielder William Webb failed to find the net in a 2–1 defeat to Gordon College. In spite of the loss, the Carnegie men’s return to the NCAA tournament and their strong finish in the UAA conference standings both bode well for next season.
Women’s Cross Country
Debuting under head coach Timothy Connelly, the Carnegie Mellon women’s cross country team had a mix of successes that both showed the talent and tenacity of the team. Coming off of a positive 2014, highlighted by 7th place finish at NCAA Regionals, the Tartan women looked to continue to improve.
Early on, Carnegie made subtle improvements, equaling a 4th place finish at the Carnegie Mellon Invitational from a year ago despite an expanded field. But the Tartans didn’t stop there, generating excitement for their great potential with a 1st place finish out of 29 teams, including two UAA rivals, at the Inter–Regional Rumble at Oberlin College the following week. Led by senior runner Rekha Schnepf, the Tartans finished 7th at NCAA Regionals again this year, but showed they have room to improve. The team will be one to watch out for next season.
Women’s Soccer
The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team had one of the best years in program history, dominating through most of the season in a potential bid for a UAA Championship and more. The team followed through on their UAA bid, finishing off UAA play with a win over Case Western Reserve University to leave them 6–1–0 in conference play, good enough for the championship.
The team then entered the NCAA tournament as the No. 5 ranked team in the nation, and went on to win games in the first two rounds of tournament play. The Tartans fell in the sectional semifinal to 20th ranked Calvin College, losing in overtime in spite of a strong offensive and defensive combination through out the game.
With a lot of success and something left the strive for, the Carnegie women can look back on their accomplishments with pride while looking forward to a chance to do even more next year.
Women’s Volleyball
The Carnegie Mellon women’s volleyball team opened up their season with a winning clinic, taking care of business on 24 of their first 25 sets, while winning 11 straight games. Extending their success going into the UAA tournament, they went 4–3 in conference play, backed by strong play from senior libero Molly Higgins and junior setter Emily Newton.
Despite of their positive record all season, the Tartan women found themselves disappointed early in the UAA tournament, with a first round loss to University of Chicago ending their bid for a conference title. The team finished the tournament with a couple wins in order to secure a 5th place UAA finish, before continuing to ECAC South tournament play.
In the ECAC South Tournament, Carnegie built off two wins to advance to the final, and finished as the runner–up in the region to Swarthmore College. With a 29–8 finish to the season, and a runner–up finish in the ECAC south tournament, the Tartans managed a successful result through tough competition.

On Feb. 7, 2015, Super Bowl 50 will shape up to be the biggest entertainment event in history, at least until the next year’s game. Well over 100 million Americans will watch the game and the halftime show, and millions more will be watching all over the world. It’s safe to say that football has been the dominant sport in the American market for quite some time, and that title carries a huge payday to the National Football League (NFL).
The Dallas Cowboys, New England Patriots, Washington Redskins, New York Giants, and Houston Texans are all worth over $1 billion each and are the most highly valued teams in the NFL. At the bottom of the barrel, the St. Louis Rams’ net worth of $930 million stands as a testament to the amount of money in football. Player salaries have risen considerably since the latest collective bargaining agreement (CBA) put an end to the $70 million contracts that top rookie prospects commanded. The top-tier quarterbacks in the league now command $100 million contracts easily, with Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers making $22 million last year alone. Head coaches top out with $8 million for Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll and New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton while the bottom five head coaches took $3.5 million each.
Despite the financial boom in football that shows no sign of slowing down barring a huge recession, the NFL continues to face big challenges to its status as the premier sports league in the United States. The integrity of the league itself has undergone intense scrutiny due to its handling of the Deflategate scandal from the 2014 AFC Championship Game. Commissioner of the NFL Roger Goodell was resolute on issuing a strict punishment on the Patriots as other owners put the pressure on him to act stronger than he did in 2007 Spygate scandal. Although Patriots owner Robert Kraft accepted the league stripping the Patriots of two draft picks and fining the team $1 million, he was furious when Goodell decided to suspend Patriots quarterback Tom Brady for four games.
The basis for the suspension was a report conducted by a firm called Exponent, whose findings were cited by the Wells Report and considered proof that the Patriots had intentionally brought underinflated footballs to cheat. Outside the NFL, many scientists disagreed, reaching conclusion that the deflated balls in the game were consistent with the Ideal Gas Law. Carnegie Mellon physics professor Gregg Franklin explained away the issue in a January 2015 press release. “It’s pretty simple physics,” Franklin said. “If you pump up a bicycle tire using air from a warm room and then take it outside on a cold winter day, you’ll find that the pressure in the tire decreases as the air in the tire cools off. The air pressure in a football is no different. If a football is inflated to the minimum pressure allowed by the NFL—12.5 pounds per square inch—using warm air, the football’s pressure will drop below this minimum value as the air cools.”
Goodell’s insistence on being both the deliverer of Brady’s suspension and the only one the quarterback could appeal to drew much ire. Brady and the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) argued that Goodell was overstepping the bounds of the CBA. The NFLPA took Brady’s case to the legal system, and U.S. District Judge Richard Brennan sided with Brady, forcing the NFL to cancel the suspension. Still, Goodell insisted on appealing to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, continuing to escalate the feud to this day. Had Goodell abided by the rules of the CBA and issued a fine on Brady, his authority as commissioner might have been attacked by other owners, but it would never have gotten into the U.S. court system. With a judge’s order to reel in the commissioner’s powers, it appears that there will be unrest in the league’s system as the balance of power changes. What effects this may have on football’s future is completely unknown.
While the changing balance of power may lead to devastating consequences down the line, player safety concerns threaten to destroy the game more immediately. Early on during the last offseason, four players under the age of 30 decided to retire early rather than risk developing lasting impairments. San Francisco 49ers linebacker Patrick Willis, Tennessee Titans quarterback Jake Locker, Pittsburgh Steelers outside linebacker Jason Worilds and Oakland Raiders running back Maurice Jones-Drew all decided to retire in spite of the money on the table. Though the NFL has been trying a number of measures to try to improve player safety, the reality of professional football’s damage to the human body could end up making the tough nature of football a huge deterrent rather than a positive for the league.
For the NFL, times are good now, and they probably will stay good for quite some time. However, the ongoing challenges that the NFL faces must be handled well. Otherwise, football will relinquish its status as the most prominent sport in America, something that no player, owner, or league executive would like to see.
Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article referenced the St. Louis Rams’ value of $930 million, rather than their net worth of $930 million.

Men’s Golf
The Carnegie Mellon men’s golf team is looking to build off of steady improvement in the fall going into championship season. The Tartan men worked their way from a 14th place finish out of 18 teams at the Flower City Preview in September to a 1st place finish out of six teams at the Carnegie Mellon Fall Invitational to close out the fall season.
Paced by sophomore Nikhil Mohan and ever consistent first-year Austin Lin, who has recorded scores between 75 and 79 in all of his rounds, the team is poised to outperform its UAA Championship performance from a year ago. Last time around, only two players recorded scores under 80. This year, the men have a good at chance at getting four scores under the mark.
With the UAA Championships set for the weekend of March 12th, Carnegie will look to improve on last year’s second place finish.
Men’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team has had a slow start to their season. Currently 7–9 (0–5 in the UAA), the team has struggled in conference competition. Last year, the team faced similar struggles early on, winning only one conference game in January, before going 4–5 in the conference in February, upsetting 12th ranked Washington University in St. Louis.
Junior forward Jack Serbin will be a key to any Tartan turnaround, playing as an offensive and defensive centerpiece for the team through their first 15 games. Current Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference (ECAC) South Player of the Week Serbin has led the team in scoring and rebounding, with 19.3 points per game and 10.7 rebounds per game.
The group has benefited from the contributions of first-year center Patrick Ehland, a young spark for the team with a team–leading field goal percentage of 56.4 percent. With more UAA contests coming up to determine the final conference standings, the team will take advantage of contributions from throughout the roster as they try to turn things around.
Men’s Swimming & Diving
With continuing dominance in duals a foregone conclusion (9–0), the Carnegie Mellon men’s swimming and diving team is working to build momentum going into the UAA Championships in February. There is room for improvement at conferences, with last year’s 5th place finish serving as a reminder of the fierce competition the team will face from other parts of the UAA.
The Tartan men look to have a very bright future, with a dominant young roster. The swimmers are led by freshmen sprint specialist Jack Dangremond and freestyle and butterfly specialist Mitchell Riek. The two freshmen combine to lead the team in seven events, five of which are led by Riek. On the diving side of the team, first-year diver Gabriel Bamforth provides an injection of talent to the dive team, leading the men in scoring in every dive event. With a very young and talented group powering the roster, the team will look to turn heads at UAAs.
Men’s Tennis
The Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team will look to improve on a strong performance from last year, with continued dominance by senior singles player Abhishek Alla and growing depth brought by the freshmen class. Alla showcased his benefit to the team with a win at the ITA Southeast Regional, beating 64 other contestants in a dominant fashion.
The team also showed off its depth at the same event, with a semi–final appearance by first-year singles player Daniel Levine, who was eliminated by Alla. The first big test for the squad will come in a dual meet against Duquesne University at the end of the month. This is where the group got handed their first loss of the season last year.
The Tartans will then go on to test themselves at the ITA National team indoor championships on February 19th.
Men’s Track & Field
The Carnegie Mellon men’s track and field team has gotten off to a strong start this season, and will look to translate their successes into victories in a dual meet with Case Western and at the UAA Indoor and Outdoor Championships later on in the season.
At the indoor championships, the Tartans will look to replace the contributions of last year’s 5000–meter UAA champion George Degen by turning to other contributors on a deep squad. Passionate first-year long jumper Rai Walters earned ECAC Rookie of the Week honors in his first collegiate competition with a jump of 6.80 meters, demonstrating the young talent on the men’s squad.
The team will look for a strong UAA performance on February 27th at New York University (NYU).
Women’s Golf
In their second year as a varsity team, the Carnegie Mellon women’s golf team looks to improve on their breakout first year as a program. A strong core of sophomores spearheads the team, which demonstrates strong potential to improve their standing within the UAA and nationally.
With four starting players having recorded rounds under 85, the team has the talent to compete at big meets, but needs to establish consistency. However, since they are currently outside of a conference with an automatic qualifier for nationals, it will be a challenge to rise to the top level this year.
Women’s Basketball
Looking unstoppable in the early goings of the season, the No. 21 ranked Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team has rolled to a 13–2 (2–3 in the UAA) record. With a mix of high-scoring beat downs on weaker opponents (the Tartan women currently average 77.7 points per game) and challenging showdowns with other highly ranked UAA opponents, the season looks to be a big one for the Tartans.
Junior center and forward Lisa Murphy has played consistently at very high level for the Tartan women, averaging a nation leading 26.1 points per game. Murphy’s field goal percentage of 78.0% also leads the nation, and leaves little doubt about why the women have proved to be so successful. Murphy has already collected 5 UAA Player of the Week awards this season.
The Tartan women will look to ride Murphy’s success to additional victories in UAA play through February. Matchups against No. 6 Washington University in St. Louis and No. 8 NYU loom large on the schedule. These games look to play a big factor in the team’s late season outcomes.
Women’s Swimming & Diving
Rolling at 9–0 with aspiration for the UAA championships and the NCAA DIII Championships, the Carnegie Mellon women’s swimming and diving team has looked strong and balanced early.
A diverse group of athletes of all ages provides a balanced backing to the Tartan team. Junior freestyle specialist Allison Kirkby will take charge in the sprint events, as she leads the team in the 50, 100, and 200 meter freestyle. Sophomore Individual Medley and butterfly specialist Mary St. John will help out a deep group of swimmers in the longer events, excelling at the 400 IM. And senior diver Winona Li will provide support from the dive team, leading the group in both the 1 and 3 meter dives off of six attempts.
With contributions from a large group, the group will look to make their depth count late in the season.
Women’s Tennis
The Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team will look to translate a good showing in the fall into a continuation of their success in championship season this year. Coming off a 2nd place UAA finish last year, and an All American selection for junior singles player Vanessa Pavia, the team will work to improve its UAA standing this time round.
Senior singles player Brooke Tsu was a source of the Carnegie women’s fall success, finishing as runner up in the ITA Southeast Regional in October.
The team will resume play for the year in earlier February, with home opponents including a tough matchup with Duquesne University on February 13th.
Women’s Track and Field
Coming off a strong performance at the Al Hall Freedom Games, the Carnegie Mellon women’s track and field team will try to continue the success through the UAA Indoor Championships, and the UAA Outdoor Championships later in the season. The Tartan women will look to have a big year, by reloading their squad after the loss of seniors Sasha Spalding and Erin Kiekhaefer from last year’s squad.
Freshman high jumper Tessa Allen started off her opening season with an impressive performance, jumping 1.60 meters, which tied her for 2nd all time in the history of the women’s program.
The Tartans’ first big test will be against Case Western Reserve University on January 30th, where they will look to recover from a loss last year.

The Tartans will return to action in the Battle for the Obelisk against Case Western Reserve University on Saturday, Jan. 30.
Women’s Track & Field
The Carnegie Mellon women’s track and field team split into two halves to compete at the Denison Lid Lifter and at the SPIRE North Coast Indoor Track & Field Open on Saturday. The North Coast Open was unscored, but the Tartans placed third at the Lid Lifter with 92 points.
At the Lid Lifter, junior pole vaulter Grace Yee broke the school pole vault record by vaulting for 3.20 meters, breaking the old mark of 3.10 meters set by Lisa Marion Garcia in 2011. First-year hurdler and jumper Claire Yuan ran to a second-place finish in the 60-meter dash with a time of 8.50. First-year jumper and thrower Hannah Mahon placed second in the high jump with a height of 1.47 meters. At the SPIRE, junior hurdler and jumper Rebecca Fortner tied a career-best after clearing the bar at 1.60 meters in the high jump to place third. In the mile run, junior mid-distance runner Shaheen Essabhoy ran a career-best time of 5:34.63 to finish second. The Tartans will next compete at the Battle for the Obelisk against Case Western Reserve University on Saturday, Jan. 30.
Men’s Basketball
On Friday, the Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team traveled to Emory University, falling 75–61. The Tartans were able to jump to an early lead.

On Sunday, the Tartans squared off in a tight matchup against the University of Rochester. The battle was tight to the very end. First-year forward and center Patrick Ehland managed to get an offensive rebound as time ran down on the Tartans’ last hopes for a win, but a three point attempt by senior guard Jason Sebak fell short of the mark, ending the game in a 66–63 loss for the Tartans.
With the two losses, the Tartans fell to 7–9 overall and 0–5 in the UAA. The Tartans will look to rebound against New York University on Friday, Jan. 29.
Women’s Basketball
On Friday, the Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team ranked 20th in the nation by D3hoops.com took on Emory University, falling by 63–52.
Junior guard Jackie Hudepohl made the first three shots for the Tartans, helping them jump to an early 8–5 lead. The Tartans managed to keep it close with the Eagles, but a missed opportunity to tie the game 52–52 allowed Emory to seal the game away. Junior center and forward Liza Murphy was the driving force of the team, scoring 23 points and making 15 rebounds.
On Sunday, the Tartans faced off against the seventh ranked University of Rochester, falling 75–52. Rochester’s defense kept the Tartans to a season-low 31.5% shooting from the floor. Hudepohl led the Tartans with 13 points while Murphy scored a season-low 12 points.

Carnegie Mellon University Hyperloop team gave a quick overview presentation of their entry for the 2016 SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition on Friday, Jan. 22.
The ultimate goal of a Hyperloop system is to “revolutionize travel and connection between people,” according to Michael Hill, a masters student in the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon. The purpose of the Hyperloop system is “to create a tube connecting San Francisco to Los Angeles” where one could travel at speeds approaching 760 mph, condensing the entire 386 mile journey into 30 minutes of mach-speed travel. 
Elon Musk, the CEO and CTO of SpaceX, has outsourced this problem to universities and engineering teams far and wide in an effort to make this futuristic dream a reality. As one of the 100 teams sorted out of 1,500 to be in the semi-finals, Carnegie Mellon Hyperloop is well on its way to making a functioning Hyperloop happen.
The end goal for Carnegie Mellon’s Hyperloop team is to receive the okay to build a functioning Hyperloop pod and compete against 10 to 14 other teams in California this coming June. The team began its work in May and has since grown to include over 75 members, not only from engineering backgrounds but from design and business as well. This robust team has allowed Carnegie Mellon Hyperloop to raise a tremendous amount of support and money — $25,000 so far. If they make it through to the next stage of the competition, they will be looking at a $100,000 price tag for their Hyperloop pod prototype build.
The presentation, given by the project manager Anshuman Kumar, a masters student in the Integrated Innovation Institute, focused on the internal mechanics of the pod’s design. The system was designed to move at low levels of friction utilizing an air bearing system that has never been used before in mass transport. Air bearings use a thin layer of pressurized air, which allows two surfaces to support an object’s load, similar to the way an air-hockey table supports a puck. 
Since air bearings are a contact-free system, they steer clear of many problems relating to friction, lubrication, and wear. They also have high-speed applications which are prime for Hyperloop purposes. This system is an interesting choice, considering the low-pressure, low air density conditions within the Hyperloop tube itself. One of the main balancing acts facing the team, it seems, is the balance between having enough air for the bearings to function and having as little air as possible to create drag and slow down the pod.
One of the most enterprising features of the Carnegie Mellon Hyperloop team’s progress is that they do not seem to be phased by obstacles. Every time the team encountered a particular component that was nowhere to be found on the free market, they created their own; from the air bearing system to the air storage tank to the re-purposed helicopter compressor, the designs are one-of-a-kind. For every problem, it seems, the team is working on a feasible solution.
The CMU Hyperloop team will travel to Texas A&M University this coming weekend, Jan. 29-30, to present their designs to SpaceX and Tesla engineers in an attempt to move into the final round of prototype construction and the final race event in June.

On December 22, the White House named Jonathan Rothberg, a Carnegie Mellon University alumnus and trustee, one of eight recipients of the 2016 National Medal of Technology and Innovation.
The National Medal of Technology and Innovation, created in 1980 by the United States Department of Commerce’s Patent and Trademark Office, is the nation’s highest honor for technical achievement. According to the White House, the award recognizes those who have made lasting contributions to America’s competitiveness and quality of life and helped strengthen the Nation’s technological workforce.
Rothberg, who holds a B.S. in chemical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, an M.S., M.Phil., and Ph.D. in biology from Yale University and an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Mount Sinai School of Medicine, is being recognized for pioneering what has come to be known as Next Generation Sequencing, a method of DNA sequencing that has greatly increased the speed and efficiency of analyzing genomes and decoding DNA.
“My motivation for developing high-speed ways to understand a person’s genetic makeup was personal. I wanted to know why my son was having difficulty breathing,” Rothberg said. “I’m gratified that answering this question allowed me to take a journey with the most creative engineers, scientists, and physicians to impact the lives of people we love. I am excited to see Next Generation Sequencing help heal, feed, fuel, and secure the world by giving researchers a tool to answer some of our greatest challenges including understanding and treating cancer and other devastating diseases.”
Previously, the sequencing approach used by the Human Genome Project took ten years and relied on an approach that did not scale well. In order to address these issues, Rothberg began exploring ways to miniaturize the process. Instead of the tens of reactions that DNA sequencing was previously limited to, Rothberg’s invention enabled geneticists to perform tens of millions of sequencing reactions in parallel. All reactions take place on a small single substrate, which reduces the cost of sequencing DNA more than a million fold.
Next Generation Sequencing is now a central tool in life science research, from agriculture to environmental studies, and is starting to play a key role in both a researcher’s ability to understand disease and a physician’s ability to treat it.
In addition to receiving this award, Rothberg is the first person to be named a World Economic Forum’s Technology Pioneer four separate times; he is an Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year, and he received The Wall Street Journal’s First Gold Medal for Innovation. He also received Nature Methods’s first Method of the Year Award, The Irvington Institute’s Corporate Leadership Award in Science, the Connecticut Medal of Technology, and the DGKL Biochemical Analysis Prize.
Rothberg is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering, a life trustee of Carnegie Mellon University, and an Adjunct Professor of Genetics at the Yale School of Medicine. He is also the founder of several successful companies, including 454 Life Science, CuraGen, Ion Torrent, Raindance Technologies, Hyperfine Research, Butterfly Network Inc., LAM Therapeutics, and 4Catalyzer.
“We congratulate Jonathan on this important honor,” said Carnegie Mellon University President Subra Suresh in a university press release. “Jonathan’s work embodies the culture of Carnegie Mellon – finding innovative solutions to scientific challenges that make a real difference in the world.”
The recipients of the award will receive their medals during a White House ceremony early this year.

Carnegie Mellon researchers, alongside others, are focusing on neurological research with the goal of gaining a deeper understanding of how specific parts of the brain relate to the organ’s overall function. Currently, many specific functions are thought to be localized in certain parts of the brain. The neocortex, for example, which is comprised of six layers, is the part of the brain that is associated with higher cognitive processes such as spatial reasoning, generation of motor commands, sensory perception, and conscious thought. 
Each layer of the neocortex is made up of different cell types, which are organized in a very specific way. Based on a particular person’s experiences, or the “load” experienced by their nervous system, neurons in the brain form or retract, and can even grow new connections. These connections are called synapses, and they form the basis for neural communication.  Researchers are currently working on understanding the activity of these neurons and defining the specific set of rules that govern cell-to-cell communication.
A new method developed by researchers at Carnegie Mellon uses machine learning algorithms coupled with a specialized staining technique to create a broader picture of neocortical synapses. This method of microscopy takes in a large piece of tissue and visualizes all of the synapses across its entirety. These synapses appear as little, dark spots with a specific shape. 
This method then uses a machine learning algorithm to identify and differentiate the synapses in the data. By doing so, a larger area of the cortical region can be analyzed, compared to the relatively tiny capability of existing microscopy                   techniques. These techniques not only took a much longer time to analyze the same amount of tissue, but also had a very limited scope of vision. For example, they would allow a “cell-by-cell,” “pair-by-pair connection” to be observed, but the cost, in terms of both time and efficiency, were very heavy. Thus, by giving less importance to cell-type specificity, the team’s new technique allows for a much faster way to understand synaptic activity.
“This is probably the largest microscopy study that has ever been done in terms of looking at lots of animals and a really broad array of tissue,” Alison Barth, one of the key members of the research project and a member of the Center for Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC) said. The CNBC is a joint program between Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh.
Barth explained that this new machine learning technique allows researchers to rapidly count and compare different animals’ brains across different conditions to see what part of the circuit changes when the input is altered. 
A study of the data reveals that, when the sensory input that arrived at the brain was changed, the density of synapses across layers changed. The density of observable synapses increased or decreased and in some cases, synapses even became longer. These longer synapses had not been visualized before. Barth explained that “by using machine learning to do the work for us, we are breaking open the direction that we want to go and expanding the areas of the brain that we want to focus on.”
An invention disclosure has been filed for this technique, and Barth believes that there is potential for this technique to be used as a tool for medical diagnosis or understanding learning processes. The study was published in the Journal of Neuroscience and featured on the cover. 
The lead author and researcher of this study is Santosh Chandrasekaran, a graduate student from Carnegie Mellon and currently a Postdoctoral Associate at the University of Pittsburgh. In addition to Barth and Chandrasekaran, the research team included Saket Navlakha, currently at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies; Joseph Suhan, a lecturer from Carnegie Mellon’s Department of Biological Sciences; and Ziv Bar-Joseph, a professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Machine Learning department.

Since the creation of the Internet, humans have been able to harness it for great purposes, such as creating databases of knowledge, providing pathways of communication, and—most importantly—streaming Netflix. However, there is a lot that occurs between the time when you click on the Internet icon and when the browser pops up. Connecting to the Internet involves a complicated integration of hardware and software, especially to connect across platforms — synching a phone to a computer, for instance.
To get online, a user needs to have a device that can connect with the Internet. An electronic device can be designed to sync to another device based on the hardware it contains, thereby generating a network, or connection, between devices. The Internet is a large web of these networks. It provides a pathway through which millions of different electronic devices can connect to and interact with one another.
Because the Internet is accessed by millions of different electronic devices, it has to be governed by certain universal protocols to make sure all the devices can talk to one another. These protocols are implemented into both the hardware and software of Internet accessing devices. The Internet itself is not a physical entity, rather a set of protocols through which electronic devices can access each other.
These protocols involve Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, which are analogous to street addresses. Much like a house needs an address to send and receive mail, each computer requires an IP address in order to identify where to send information and where said information came from. An IP address is not built into a computer; instead, IP addresses are assigned to various geographical locations by an organization called the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). These IP addresses can change from time to time. But certain devices, such as an Internet server for a company like Verizon, require constant, efficient connection to the Internet. In order to provide this, IANA assigns static IP addresses for these devices.
Once a connection has been established between the start point and the end point of a message, a pathway must be provided along which the data can be transmitted from sender to receiver. When a message gets sent across computers, the software in the sender computer actually breaks the message down into smaller chunks of data called packets. When it does so, it assigns an IP address to each packet to indicate where the message must be sent.
To reach the receiver, these packets travel through various devices called routers, which deliver the message to its proper destination by reading the IP address of each packet and forwarding it along to a router closer to the destination. Packets are sent across millions of different routers—each with varying efficiency and strength—and because of this, packets can be delivered in any randomized order. To overcome this obstacle, the sender computer embeds a serial number within each packet of data to identify its place in the entire message. This way, when the receiver computer receives all these packets, it can reassemble them correctly to produce the proper message.
The number of different paths a packet can take across routers are nearly infinite, and the same path is almost never repeated. Additionally, specific devices at the edges of the Internet pathway provide data transmission between the computer and router media. These devices are provided by organizations called Internet Service Providers, which act as the connection between a user and the Internet.
The Internet is analogous to a mailing service: it takes a message containing a destination address and the sender’s address and provides the medium through which this information is delivered. As we continue designing technologies which are capable of interacting and communicating with each other, we continue to improve convenience and usability across  platforms.

Venus flytrap learn by counting insect touch
A German research team has found that the Venus flytrap initiates different processes in its digestion of insect food depending on the number of times an insect stimulates the plant’s sensors. Broadly speaking, an insect that sits on the inner surface of the plant’s maw, the part of the plant used to trap prey, stimulates the micro sensors located there, which causes the firing of biological electrical impulses known as action potentials. 
The study reveals that after two action potentials, the trap closes shut in a 10 to 15 second time window. Once the prey has been trapped, another three or more action potentials cause the release of prey-degenerative fluids that allow the plant to obtain the necessary nutrients from the insect. Further studies may focus on reachers’ ability to better understand exactly how the series of electrical impulses triggers the different stages of the plant’s biological response.

Hagfish hydrogel has unique properties
Recently, the gel properties of Hagfish slime have caught the attention of a group of ETH Zurich researchers at the Laboratory of Food Process Engineering of Professor Erich Windhab. Hagfish are eel-shaped fish that have been around for millions of years. 
The hagfish’s defense mechanism consists of secreting two types of cells into surrounding ocean water, one producing protein filaments and the other producing mucin, a protein whose key characteristic is its ability to form gels. When released, these cells burst, and the two proteins react with the water to instantaneously form slime, which can immobilize the surrounding water and predators. Hagfish slime consists of nearly 100 percent water and only 0.004 percent gelling agent. These filaments, measuring 150 micrometers within the fish, extend to several centimeters in length when introduced into ocean water. While this mechanism is under heavy study, it eludes researchers thus far.

Robots to wither into dust alongside humans
Scientists at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) are creating bioplastics from food waste, which can be used to create lifelike, biodegradable skin for robots. This could allow robots to decompose at the end of their lives in an eco-friendly manner. Athanassia Athanassiou, who leads the Smart Materials Lab at the IIT, says that the bioplastic can be flexible or tough, so it could be used for both robot skin and interior robot parts. 
A biodegradable robot can have many uses, and, as robotics Professor Jonathan Rossiter at the University of Bristol stated in 2012, “once a biodegradable robot has reached the end of its mission, for example having performed some environmental cleanup activity following an oil spill, it will decompose into harmless material.” Athanassiou says that creating a completely biodegradable robot could be possible within the next few years.

Zebra stripes not for camouflage nor social interactions
Researchers from the University of California, Davis and University of Calgary, Canada have suggested that zebra stripes are not used primarily for camouflage, as previously thought. This study involved the analysis of data that took into account the visibility of stripes by hyenas, lions and even zebras under different lighting conditions and over several distances. 
It was found that, unlike humans, zebra predators cannot distinguish zebra stripes at distances of 50 meters in daylight and 30 meters at twilight. Furthermore, it becomes harder for most species to distinguish these stripes from nine meters on moonless nights. Within such short distances, most zebra predators can already smell and hear their prey. This renders the stripes ineffective as camouflage. This also disproves the hypothesis that stripes perform a social function, since zebras cannot identify the stripes from distances that are significantly greater than their predators can see.

Internet use affects family dynamics
A study from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and Georgia State University aims to better understand the familial communication and relationships of students with problematic Internet use (PIU). PIU is characterized by “spending more than 25 hours a week on the Internet on non-school or non-work-related activities, and experiencing Internet-associated health or psychosocial problems.” 
The study involved interpreting data from 27 students who identified themselves as being problematic Internet users. The results of the study show that these students connect with their families better when away from them but demonstrate deteriorated communication and conflict when with them in-person. PIU is associated with negative mental health issues such as depression, social anxiety, and sleeplessness, and it is estimated to be found in as high as 15 percent of the U.S. population, with college students especially prone to it.

Science disproves Spiderman viability
Research from the University of Cambridge’s Department of Zoology recently found that geckos are the largest animals who can reliably scale smooth, vertical walls using their adhesive footpads. Larger animals would need far more pads covering their body’s surface area to perform the same kind of climbing endeavors. 
The study, published in PNAS, found that the percentage of body surface covered in padding increases with body size for all climbing animals, from spiders and mites to larger animals like geckos. Research from the University of Cambridge’s Department of Zoology postulates that humans would need about 40 percent of their total body surface covered in sticky pads to mimic the climbing abilities of geckos. This translates to roughly 80 percent of one’s frontal body. This research has implications on the feasibility of large-scale adhesives.

The 88th Academy Awards, to be broadcast on Feb. 28 at 7:00 p.m. EST from the Dolby Theater in Hollywood, CA, has been shined with a dim light in recent weeks since The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced their nominees. Opinions have been flying and, though all are valid, have distracted from the Award’s true purpose: the celebration of film. The story on every headline regards an important and immediate problem that has to be solved, but I’d like to take a step back from it for a moment and look at this year’s Best Picture nominees. This section will strive to find the light in the darkness, even if it may require pulling a rabbit out of a hat.
The Best Picture slate this year has a little of everything, just like your favorite three course meal. Best Picture is typically earmarked for dramas, but 2015 presents a main course of action drama; a sprinkle of indie spice; and a tall glass of comedy. And for desert? One scoop of political thriller sorbet to clean your palate. Voila! Bon appétit! Now that dinner is served, let’s dig in.
The Big Short
You wouldn’t think that the man behind Anchorman and Talladega Nights would be able to tackle such an issue as the 2008 crash of the United States housing market and achieve it with an artistic self-awareness that audiences are not accustomed to. Attempting to entertain, as well as educate, writer/director Adam McKay frequently breaks the fourth wall to carry the audience along for the ride. The Big Short follows a group of off-Wall St. lenders and analysts who saw what no one else dared to glance at: the instability of the housing market. They plot to short, or bet against, the market in anticipation of massive returns when the defaulting bonds they have shorted go bust. But when they realize what they have done — bet on a broken system — reality takes out its bat and takes a big swing for the fences sending our guys into a spiral of riches and melancholy understanding. Starring Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale, and Brad Pitt, The Big Short was a favorite of mine in 2015 because of its light-hearted, human approach to a side of, perhaps, the most somber event of the last decade.
Its nomination is well deserved, but I do not anticipate The Big Short to take home the prize. The nominations list has some heavyweight fighters on it, and The Big Short sports a mean right hook, but the field seems too stacked for producers Brad Pitt, Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner to be walking on stage on Oscar Sunday.
Additional nominations: Actor In A Supporting Role, Christian Bale; Directing, Adam McKay; Film Editing, Hank Corwin; Adapted Screenplay, Charles Randolph and Adam McKay
Bridge of Spies
There are certain players in Hollywood that play on another level from others. If the director is the head coach, Steven Spielberg is Bill Belichick. Tom Hanks is Tom Brady. When these two pair up, you can count on the movie being good. Bridge of Spies is no exception. Hanks plays James Donovan, a Cold War era insurance lawyer chosen to represent captured Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). Rylance delivers the performance of note. Political thrillers run few and far between nowadays, but Bridge of Spies is another top tier film in 2015.
Additional nominations: Actor In A Supporting Role, Mark Rylance; Original Score, Thomas Newman; Production Design, Adam Stockhausen; Set Decoration, Rena DeAngelo and Bernhard Henrich; Sound Mixing, Andy Nelson, Gary Rydstrom, and Drew Kunin; Original Screenplay, Matt Charman and Ethan Coen & Joel Coen
Brooklyn
I will admit it: I am a crier. When movies can make me well up, that’s a sign that I am thoroughly enjoying myself. Congratulations, Brooklyn. Some are calling the lead, Saoirse Ronan, a “breakout star,” but I wouldn’t call her a “breakout.” She’s been here for years. Nominated for Best Supporting Actress in 2007 for her role in Atonement, Ronan delivers again as Eilis Lacey, a young Irish girl who immigrates to New York in search of a better life. Set in the 1950s, Brooklyn’s exploration of themes like family, home, and the mysteries of the heart is shown elegantly by director John Crowley. The film is visually stunning, with an intriguing script that uses the juxtaposition of cultures to its advantage.
Additional nominations: Actress In A Leading Role, Saoirse Ronan; Adapted Screenplay, Nick Hornby
Mad Max: Fury Road
Perhaps the biggest “dark horse” nominee among the eight nominated films is director George Miller’s wasteland road rager. What I remember after eight months since its May release are the stunning visual effects, dynamic cinematography, and music. Starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, Mad Max: Fury Road is an epic journey through endless desert to escape the clutches of Immortan Joe. It is not a complex story that makes this film as brilliant as it is. It is the rooted effort to achieve originality that sets Fury Road up for brilliance. Personally, I think Mad Max: Fury Road has the smallest chance of winning Best Picture simply because of how unlike typical Oscar winners it is. It is not the best film of the year, but it is my personal favorite.
Additional nominations: Cinematography, John Seale; Costume Design, Jenny Beavan; Directing, George Miller; Film Editing, Margaret Sixel; Makeup and Hairstyling, Lesley Vanderwalt, Elka Wardega and Damian Martin; Production Design, Colin Gibson; Set Decoration, Lisa Thompson; Sound Editing, Mark Mangini and David White; Sound Mixing, Chris Jenkins, Gregg Rudloff, and Ben Osmo; Visual Effects, Andrew Jackson, Tom Wood, Dan Oliver, and Andy Williams
The Martian
Ridley Scott’s The Martian traps Mark Watney on Mars after a storm separates him from his team. The team is forced to liftoff after connection with Watney is lost. Surviving the storm, Mark must retrofit his skills and equipment to survive while attempting to make contact with Earth. At face value,  there’s not much difference than Cast Away or Robinson Crusoe but The Martian takes a unique approach to the survival story, and not at the expense of character. Watney is not the serious survivalist most left-alone stories star. Watney is a charismatic man with a self-aware sense of humor. The film hits on a series of comedic instances that paces the film quite nicely. Most of the drama, in fact, takes place back on Earth as the world tries to establish contact and wade through the public relations disaster that is leaving someone alive on Mars. Some are calling Ridley Scott’s not being nominated for Best Director one of this year’s most glaring snubs, and I am inclined to agree. The pacing, comedic, and production elements of The Martian are to be celebrated and, though the film did receive a number of other nominations, Scott should be congratulated on another successful venture into sci-fi.
Additional nominations: Actor In A Leading Role, Matt Damon; Production Design, Arthur Max; Set Decoration, Celia Bobak; Adapted Screenplay, Drew Goddard
The Revenant
Only two directors in history have won back-to-back Best Picture awards: John Ford in 1940 (The Grapes of Wrath) and 1941 (How Green Was My Valley), and Joseph L. Mankiewicz in 1949 (A Letter To Three Wives) and 1950 (All About Eve). Alejandro G. Iñárritu can join this list with his exposé on the resilience of the human spirit and the will to survive. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as hunter/explorer Hugh Glass, The Revenant is a powerful film that achieves excellence on a number of different levels, none more so than the acting and cinematography. Leonardo DiCaprio is a fan favorite to win the Best Leading Actor category, and Emmanuel Lubezki could be receiving his third consecutive Oscar for cinematography, having won in 2013 for Gravity and in 2014 for Birdman.
Another of my favorites of 2015, The Revenant is being discussed as one of the films most likely to take home the ultimate prize, though it will not be easy.
Additional nominations: Actor In A Leading Role, Leonardo DiCaprio; Actor In A Supporting Role, Tom Hardy; Cinematography, Emmanuel Lubezki; Costume Design, Jacqueline West; Directing, Alejandro G. Iñárritu; Film Editing, Stephen Mirrione; Makeup and Hairstyling, Siân Grigg, Duncan Jarman and Robert Pandini; Production Design, Jack Fisk; Set Decoration Hamish Purdy; Sound Editing, Martin Hernandez and Lon Bender; Sound Mixing, Jon Taylor, Frank A. Montaño, Randy Thorn and Chris Duesterdiek; Visual Effects, Rich McBride, Matthew Shumway, Jason Smith and Cameron Waldbauer
Room
One year ago, an independent film called Whiplash was nominated for Best Picture. Audiences stormed theaters as a result of the nomination and persistent positive word of mouth. The film received a strong following and a hefty bump at the box office, all stemming from sheer quality. This year, the film I anticipate reaching similar credit is Room. Brie Larson plays Ma, a young mother who, seven years prior, was abducted and put away in a garden shed called “Room.” Now, Ma and her five-year-old son Jack must gain their freedom so Jack can experience life outside Room for the first time. Director Lenny Abrahamson explores the power of love, family, and the beauty of the world despite its worst occurrences to present a beautiful film. Based on the novel of the same name, Room is adapted for the screen by the book’s author Emma Donoghue. Good movies that exist strictly within a genre have anticipated reactions. Action movies should raise your heart rate. Comedies should make you smile. Dramas should make you cry. But great movies are able to use elements from all these to fuel its story. On a series of occasions, Room had me crying, or smiling, or having a heart attack. This is a gripping story and a film worth treating yourself to. Larson has already received a number of awards for her performance and is my choice for Best Leading Actress. Though not nominated, young Jacob Tremblay has also been recognized for his performance as Jack, and rightfully so.
Additional nominations: Best Leading Actress, Brie Larson; Directing, Lenny Abrahamson; Adapted Screenplay, Emma Donoghue
Spotlight
I have not seen a courtroom drama accomplish what Spotlight was able to. In any number of ways, this film could have fallen apart. There are so many moving parts, but director Tom McCarthy is able to keep the train on the tracks. Certainly one of the best ensemble pieces in recent years, Spotlight is the story of the “Spotlight” investigative team at the Boston Globe during the development of the Pulitzer Prize winning exposé of abuse in the Boston clergy in 2001. The brilliance of Spotlight is in the delivery of its message. The film is essentially a biopic, meaning we know how the story ends. What we may not know, and where the delivery lies, is the journey and the characters’ reactions to the startling revelations of the story. This was executed with an elegance and maturity that you would come to expect from champion journalists. There’s no childish shouting matches or nonsensical overreaction. Only a gripping and disturbingly unsettling story unfolding itself before your eyes.
Additional nominations: Actor In A Supporting Role, Mark Ruffalo; Actress In A Supporting Role, Rachel McAdams; Film Editing, Tom McArdle; Original Screenplay, Josh Singer and Tom McCarthy

Some celebrity deaths hit you harder than others. The first Thursday of classes, the news of actor Alan Rickman’s death hit me harder than I was expecting, especially following only four days after musician and cultural icon David Bowie’s death on January 10. Both of these artists were pillars of my youth and childhood; their deaths came unexpectedly and the cold weather always sets a rather blue and unhappy tone for the days going by.
If there is anything that deaths like this teach the rest of the world, it’s that underneath the frenzy of the Harry Potter franchise or avant garde artistry, these artists — and others like them — lived private lives, just like regular people. Deaths like this bring to the forefront the idea that in this day and age, the media allows us to know a true artist, that their lives are public fodder, and then turns it on its head. While the world mourns the loss of these talented individuals who were in the cultural landscape for so long, it’s important to recognize the extent to which art and person are one and the same, as well as the key distinctions between the two.
Alan Rickman, known perhaps best by millennials as Professor Severus Snape in the film adaptations of J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series, passed away at the age of 69 from cancer. His voice, which can only be described as mellifluous, is the kind that you want love letters to be read in. Even in some of his other performances, such as in Die Hard, Sense and Sensibility, or Love Actually, I picture him weeping and clutching the lifeless body of Lily Potter during the emotional memory montage of Snape in the final Harry Potter film.
Bowie, conversely, wore so many hats that it is hard to picture him in one era or one musical genre. In a cruel coincidence, Bowie passed away at the same age and from the same cause as Rickman. But while Rickman’s most notable and enduring feature is his voice, Bowie is perhaps most notable for not really having any single voice. As a result, Bowie is indelibly etched into my memory as Ziggy Stardust, his alter ego for a while. But Bowie’s career spanned beyond that in either direction. In fact, his most recent album, Blackstar, was released just two days before his death.
While these two men seemed to have little intersection, except for an interesting collision on an episode of The Simpsons years ago, their deaths, and the coincidence of them happening almost in conjunction, led to an enormous social media response. For all the Facebook statuses that pledge sorrow and sympathy toward the individuals and their families, there is the response of those close to the deceased describing more of their lives and their true nature. Many musicians paid tribute to Bowie through performances, however many of Rickman’s colleagues expressed their sorrow through stories of working with him and knowing him. Longtime collaborator actress Emma Thompson and Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe were among those who expressed their thoughts about working with Rickman: about his compassion, unwavering support, and humor, among other characteristics.
While it is great that the lives of these stars impacted so many — that is, in fact, the goal of art — it is important to respect that being impacted by their art is not the same as being impacted by their lives as individuals, nor should we treat it as such. In an era where media, social and otherwise, give people the impression that they can truly know someone, it is important to recognize that there are limits to art, and limits to the personal connections that can be made through it. The idea of this personal connection encourages people to emulate others in a positive way at best, and convinces those that they have the liberty and obligation to criticize and demean others at worst. From behind the veneer of anonymity, lashing out against anyone, not just artists, out of the illusion of personal connection is damaging and incredibly hurtful.
Now more than ever, as we mourn the loss of these great people and their art, we need to remember the limit of human understanding, and the hurt that feelings of closeness can cause. The world is so privileged by what they shared and who they were, regardless of whether or not everyone truly knew them.

After watching The League last summer, I convinced myself that I would be good at fantasy football. And when I couldn’t convince any of my friends to start a league with me, I actually found a public league through ESPN, signed up, and competed against 19 Internet strangers for four months. Team Ya Gurl Gutie actually came in eighth place, mostly thanks to the research I did every week in order to write my column in the sports section. It was probably the fiercest challenge I’ve ever faced, and it was nothing at all like The League. It did, however, fill me with a certain competitive spirit.
With the adrenaline still pumping, The Bachelor gave me one of the best late Christmas gifts a girl could ask for: thebachelorbracket.com. I really wish that Chris Harrison and his army of minions had publicized this prior to the season’s premiere, but better late than never. I created a league very soon after and began my research. It was like draft day. I got online, reread everyone’s biographies, stalked Ben Higgins — this year’s bachelor — on social media to try to figure out his type, and wasted most of an afternoon trying to guess who would be going home. I thought I would have it nailed. The bracket is very simple: every week you select the group of girls that will be continuing, thereby purposefully not selecting girls that will be going home.
I feel that The Bachelor franchise is really pushing the competitive angle this season, with the creation of the brackets, but also with the dates. It’s bad enough that these women are risking severe heartbreak at the hands of Ben Higgins — dreamcake. Plus, you have frighteningly aggressive women like Olivia and Lace who already do enough to inspire a natural sense of competition. It seems as though it couldn’t get any more cut throat. But then they’ve been making these poor, helpless victims of The Bachelor literally compete for his attention.
In week two, he sent them back to high school. They had to pair up to compete in challenges like creating an erupting volcano in a science fair and actually running hurdles, and after each challenge one team would get eliminated until the winning pair competed against each other for the title of homecoming queen. Anything having to do with high school already makes me want to punch a hole in a wall, so this “challenge” really irritated me. At least the only thing on the line was a tiara. But then, this week the group date consisted of a soccer lesson with Kelley O’Hara and Alex Morgan (of the World Cup winning U.S. women’s team), which was followed by an actual match. They divided the girls into stars and stripes and made them face off. The winning team got to go on a date with Ben, and the losers had to go back to the mansion.
Unsurprisingly, these challenges are met with a good deal of intensity. So they really aren’t even competing for his affection; it’s just a chance to earn his affection. Twin Emily came out of nowhere to be an amazing goalie. My field hockey coach always used to yell at us, “sacrifice your body!” and boy, was she ever living that. She instantly went from being totally off my radar to being one of my favorites. I like her spirit.
Sidebar on the twins: it’s my understanding that this coming week Ben will be taking them for a two on one. This is my absolute least favorite date of every season. It always ends so painfully, like one person crying on a mountain while the other two take off in a helicopter. In this case, we really haven’t even gotten a chance to get to know them as individuals. But when we finally do, one of them has to leave! I think this is cruel. I want them to have a chance to be Emily and Haley, not just the twins. We’ll finally get to know them, but only when they’re pitted against each other. This situation is honestly an outrage. Shame on you, Chris Harrison. But honestly it’s just a matter of time before E! gives them a reality show. Check out blondesense702.com.
And finally, I am thoroughly loving the unraveling of Olivia, the epitome of competitiveness. I don’t have her making it through week four, but I love that she’s in denial. Her ego got so inflated so quickly that it popped for us all to enjoy on network television. The group date started with her interrupting Ben to take him away. She arranges to take him up to a room at hotel where the date is taking place, and then proceeds to howl “helloooo” from the balcony to the other girls, waving like a pageant queen. And when she didn’t get the date rose, she noted that when Ben stood up he touched her leg. That was his way of saying “Sorry, Olivia, you can’t win every time, but I’m still thinking about you.” This alone was spectacular.
But then right at the cocktail party, Ben announces that a couple very close to his family died in an airplane crash that morning. He expressed that the evening’s conversations would be really important to him understanding which women can be there for him when he’s feeling low. So naturally, Olivia interrupts him again at the beginning to take him away to talk. She comforts Ben in his time of need by complaining about her cankles, actually shedding tears. She received the final rose, which she interpreted as some other unfathomable unspoken communication. She insisted that they are meant to be, and she will be Mrs. Higgins. I expect her to go out in a blaze of glory in the very near future.
Week two, which is week one of bracketing, I only got one of the girls who did not receive a rose correct and that was a woman named Mandi. I knew she was just too unapologetically weird to make it that far. Definitely not Ben’s type. But I really didn’t expect the identical twins to make it through, an early judgment I now regret — not just because I lost points, but because I’m starting to like them. That said, how Lace got a rose was truly beyond me. In the end I wasn’t particularly upset about the other women leaving, but I hoped Jackie would make it further. Anyway, this left me two points back from first, an honor belonging to Lula Banker, the Tartan’s personnel manager.
In this week’s bracket I still only got one right, and that one was Lace. I really did expect to feel more joy in her departure. We all knew that she had some growing up to do, and it was comforting that she knew it too. The part of me that loves reality television for the drama did really enjoy the spice she added to things while she was there. I was also really disappointed to see Shushanna go. I feel like we as the Bachelor-viewers of the world were deprived of the opportunity to get to know a real gem. We didn’t even know that she could speak English until week two; there must be so many more layers to peel back. And finally, while I felt bad for Jami because she just seemed so jazzed to be there, I didn’t have any particular feelings about her departure. I truly thought Amber was going home after her dramatically passive week two, but then she came out and won the group date rose this week. I also thought he would say goodbye to Lauren H. because I just haven’t seen any spark yet. With a two for three success rate in week three, I still came out two points behind Lula.
Lula’s friend from home, Sarah Waldman, is also in our league. She didn’t compete in week two, so her points reflect that (that week’s number of points per correct guess, cumulatively). I still have a significant advantage, but she did very well this week. Hopefully she doesn’t get the chance to catch up. I feel like once we weed out the randoms and get down to ten girls I’ll have a better handle on how all the relationships look.
I predict that Olivia will be roseless alongside one of the twins — right now I say Haley — and also Amber. She confronted Ben and Jubilee and lost. She won’t recover from that. I feel confident in these picks, so hopefully I’ll slide into first.

David Bowie was a revolutionary musician. He lived a very controversial life, right from his coming out as gay with the emergence of his alter ego Ziggy Stardust to later calling his coming out the biggest mistake he ever made. However, one thing remained true: his musical talent far surpasses any controversy surrounding his sexuality. From Hunky Dory to Heroes, David Bowie has a very diverse discography.
His debut album, David Bowie, was released in 1967. However it wasn’t until the 1969 release of Space Oddity that his music began to achieve commercial success. His follow-up album Hunky Dory was not as successful at the time, but it featured probably one of his most successful songs, “Changes.” This album also featured songs such as “Andy Warhol” and “Song for Bob Dylan,” which honor some of Bowie’s influences.
In 1972, David Bowie emerged as Ziggy Stardust, a flamboyant character with pale skin and red hair. He launched a stage show with the Spiders from Mars. The stage show was immediately successful and launched Bowie into the spotlight. He began touring the United Kingdom, until the show eventually came to the United States. If there was ever an artist to define the British punk movement, it was David Bowie. He was unafraid to wear or say just about anything and Ziggy Stardust definitely showed this through his extravagant costumes.
David Bowie was also very much a product of his environment in the 70s. He reveled in the sex, drugs, and rock ‘n’ roll lifestyle that seemed to follow musicians of that era around. After coming out in 1972, he later said in 1983 that he was straight and that his interest in homosexuality was a reaction to the situation he was in as Ziggy Stardust. There were even rumors of a possible relationship between him and Mick Jagger — which aren’t hard to believe if you’ve ever seen their “Dancing in the Street” music video. Bowie also had a colorful history with politics and even claimed to support fascism and showed admiration for Adolf Hitler at one point in his life. He later chalked this up to drug abuse. He also struggled to find acceptance through religion and was turned away from Buddhism and told to follow music. Following his marriage to model Iman (formally Iman Mohamed Abdulmajid), he claimed to have a reignited relationship with God. His religious stance however was never clear as he tossed back and forth between atheism and believing in God.
The most notable thing that David Bowie did in his career was pioneer glam rock. His appearance was almost as important as his music. He was the link between punk rock and pop. With such a vast discography and wide range of different yet unique musical stylings, Bowie was one of the most important pop culture references of his time. He was heavily influenced by art and it clearly showed in his music. His sound was very experimental and pushed the boundaries of what was considered rock ‘n’ roll at the time. He also pushed the boundaries of pop music with his new wave sound. It’s hard to classify Bowie’s music as just belonging to one genre because he did both pop and punk so well.
In addition to making music, Bowie also had quite the extensive film career; he even received a Saturn Award for Best Actor for his role as Thomas Jerome Newton in The Man Who Fell to Earth. There have been several documentaries made about him over the course of his lifetime because of the interesting life he led. Everyone wanted to know more about David Bowie: from his days as Ziggy Stardust to his experimental sound, he always found a way to keep audiences intrigued.
David Bowie passed away on Jan. 10, 2016 at the age of 69 from liver cancer. He had not made his battle with cancer known to the public at the time. This came two days after the release of his album Blackstar and at the the tail end of his tenure in Lazarus, a Broadway musical. There might never be another star that does what he was able to do for not only punk rock and pop, but all pop culture in general. After over fifty years in the music industry, he became a cultural icon that has left behind fans spanning several generations.

Snowmageddon is finally here: the strange and unseasonably warm and sunny weather finally gave way to the menacing cold. As winter continues to cover campus in a sheet of ice, and Mother Nature whirls flurries of snow through the air and into our faces, it’s hard to remember the colors and aromas of a blossoming springtime. But trust me, not all hope is lost! Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Garden’s most recent exhibit, the Orchid and Tropical Bonsai Show, promises sights and smells from a warm, tropical destination.
Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Garden is home to a large assortment of permanent plant and flower gardens, as well as interchanging seasonal exhibits from a variety of artists and curators. Current seasonal exhibits include Tropical Forest Congo, Garden Railroad, and an outdoor Friday Nights of Winter Lights display.
Just in time to cure the winter blues, the Conservatory reopened its permanent Bonsai exhibits with the addition of various types of orchids to create The Orchid and Tropical Bonsai Show. This exhibit, designed by the Phipps staff, has been previously displayed, and never fails to draw a crowd. The bonsai are one of the Conservatory’s most famous displays, and the orchids are a staff favorite.
The first part of the exhibit is the large bonsai display. The tropical bonsai on display at Phipps are smaller versions of their larger, naturally occuring cousins. The trees may be smaller, but are no less beautiful and impressive. Some of the tropical bonsai on display include traditional Japanese Mock-Oranges, as well as more rare Elephant Trees. Originally from Japan, the bonsai tree (which in Japanese means “tray planting”) has served as a longtime inspiration and art form, one captured beautifully in the exhibit. Artists from all over the world “train” bonsai to form into different shapes and designs. Information about the types of bonsai, as well as how they are trained to take on different shapes, can be found on plaques around the display. Ranging from tall, slim, and sharply slanted to short, swirled, and whimsical, the exhibit offers a wide array of shapes of trained bonsai.
As you walk further through the exhibit, the rooms exclusively full of bonsai lead the way toward several transitional areas where the bonsai and orchids intermingle in displays of beautiful contrast. Baskets full of orchids hang above displays of bonsai trees, drawing guests’ eyes up toward the ceilings, where more orchids are hung and intricately displayed. The juxtaposition of the two distinct plants is striking.
Walking further still, you come to areas exclusively filled with delicate orchids, which stand out beautifully against the minimalist backdrop of the strong bonsai and glass walls. Baskets of orchids fill the various walkways and glasshouses with color and fragrance.
Phipps presents the orchids as “the flower like no other,” and after seeing the exhibit, I find it difficult to disagree. There are thousands of orchid varieties around the world, and the exhibit is packed full of some of the best varieties available to the curators. The exhibit features over a hundred different varieties of orchids, ranging vastly in color, scent, and presentation. The largest section of the orchid display is the Barbara Tisherman Slipper Orchid collection, a carefully-crafted display hosted with the conservatory in conjunction with the Orchid Society of Western Pennsylvania.
One of the greatest parts about the Orchid and Tropic Bonsai Show is its large appeal to various types of guests. The exhibit commands the appreciation of all of its guests, whether they are bonsai enthusiasts with great eyes for beautiful detail, orchid aficionados with a gratitude for the professional curating, or college students just interested in a peaceful evening admiring what seem like a billion flowers.
Though many may not be willing to make the trek through the snow over to Phipps’ Conservatory, I do highly recommend making the journey. Step out of the icy cold and into the tranquility and serenity of The Orchid and Tropic Bonsai Show. The exhibit is on display every day from now until Sunday, Feb. 28.

“Hydrogen Jukebox,” a 1990 musical collaboration between Philip Glass and Allen Ginsberg and the latest operatic production from the School of Music, is a very fitting title for the collaboration between two titans of American 20th century culture: a fusion of thought and music in a single atomically explosive package.
On one side of the collaboration we have composer Philip Glass, one of the pioneers of minimalist music, best known for his breakthrough piece Einstein on the Beach. On the other side we have Allen Ginsberg, a poet of the Beat Generation, best known for the 1956 poem “Howl Part II,” a critique of American post-war capitalist culture and sexual repression. A chance meeting between the two in a New York book store in 1988 led to “Hydrogen Jukebox,” an opera intended to form a portrait of America in the years between 1950 and 1980.
The opera has no narrative structure, but is more of a compilation of different pieces. The show starts off with low bass notes emulating ominous rumbles of thunder and flashes of light to mimic the blue lightning mentioned in the first song “Iron Horse,” a reflection on the Vietnam War and the state of war in America.
The School of Music’s production features a minimalist, industrial stage. There is a wall of ridged metal in the background, and a giant billboard in the foreground that displays the lyrics being sung. The billboard at times also shows visual annotations of some of the content in the lyrics, which is quite helpful in instances where the poems make period-specific references.
Different props are also introduced and taken off stage for each different piece. While most of the time these props are innocuous, sometimes they can be ridiculous. For instance, during “Iron Horse” a giant grenade floats down from ceiling in a not-so-subtle allusion to war. During a song about atomic warfare where one of the lines is “there were people starving and crawling…” a giant hamburger appears on the left side of the stage and a shirtless man slowly crawls on the ground towards it.
While Ginsberg is mostly known for his highly political, Beatnik-era critiques of American society, many poems featured in Hydrogen Jukebox also let us see more of Ginsberg’s more intimate and reflective sides. These pieces greatly help to break up some of the more politically heavy pieces, whose enjoyment may vary depending on someone’s political beliefs or how much knowledge they have of the time era.
“Consulting — Ching” is a contemplative song about the passing of time while slowly getting high on pot and drifting off to “the deserted city which lies below consciousness.” “Cabin in the Woods” is a haiku-like composition about watching the sun rise with a cup of tea while sitting on a tree stump in the mountains that Glass transforms into an ethereal aria. In “to P.O.” Ginsberg describes a hot summer night in Calcutta with his lover. The warm yellow lighting and the staging, a single bare yellow light bulb hanging above a rocking chair, seems to transport one into the hot hotel room where Ginsberg was staying. The music, tinged with the soft rattle of maracas and the ringing of Indian bells, has a mesmerizing, ritualistic feel. “From The Green Automobile” is an imagined road trip with an old friend; the musical composition is bright and free — woodwinds and electric tones resonate with the child-like excitement and wistful imagination of the poem. A projection of hand-drawn stars appears during the verse with “forestlike unnatural radiance illuminating the mountaintop.”
The highlight of the show, however, is “Wichita Vortex Sutra,” a poem that reconciles Ginsberg’s political and personal sides. The poem, first composed by Ginsberg on a tape recording made while traveling to Kansas on a bus, is a call for healing after the brutality of the Vietnam War. Glass’s warm yet minimal piano accompaniment flows fluidly alongside with Ginsberg’s poetry and subtly but powerfully emphasizes its emotional undertones. Junior Linguistics major Dante Horvath does an excellent, impassioned reading of the Ginsberg poem.
“Wichita Vortex Sutra,” which is performed spoken, does leaves one questioning why Glass decided to convert Ginsberg’s free verse poetry into, of all forms, opera. Much of the poetry’s original musicality in terms of the rhythm of the syllables in each verse is lost in the transition into operatic song. Verses are often stretched out or condensed at places where they normally would not be if spoken. A prime example of this is in “To Aunt Rose” where the verse “limping down the long hall in Newark on the running carpet” becomes “limmping down the long halllllllll – in Newwwwwark – on the ruuuuunning caaaaaarpet” when sung.
That is not to say all of the pieces don’t work with the format. Some poems, especially those with a more lyrical or hymn-like structure to begin with, work surprisingly well. For instance, “Howl Part II,” a condemnation of war and capitalism, features a screeching, howling sax line while harsh neon pink and red lights frame the singers. Altogether, it sounds like Satanic hymn. Similarily, the closing piece “Father Death Blues,” a poem about accepting death whose structure was also originally more lyrical, uses a wide range of voices to create a contemplative lullaby.
For those interested in the works of Glass or Ginsberg, “Hydrogen Jukebox” is a good introduction to both their styles and composition. Even for those uninterested in either artist, their collaboration on “Wichita Vortex Sutra” is an experience that must be heard; it is truly a merging of their work, a piece that brings together the best aspects of both artists.

The past couple of days have alternated between frigid and mildly cold, with the most of us content to live distraction-free—going from home to class and back. The outdoors are widely regarded as too hostile to be host to any revelry. Well, it really doesn’t have to be that way. The indoors? Well, you’re gonna be stuck inside, might as well make it entertaining. Here are five really cool (pun intended) things that you can do on a snowy day!
Outdoors:
The classics: Make a snowman. Or a snow woman. Or a snow angel. Or a castle or a monster! There’s something to be said for the soft fluffiness and pristine whiteness covering everything on a snowy day that brings out childlike creativity in everyone if they just let it. Snow artifacts are fun for kids, adults, and everyone in between. If you’ve got a sizable group, you can even have a contest of creativity. Igloos are a particular challenge. If you have a large quantity of tupperware lying around, this is a perfect idea. If you are feeling a little more creative, try making a giant teacup or a snow couch. Somewhere that you and your friends can lounge while enjoying the outside world among the swirling and sparkly snow.
Ice skating: Pittsburgh happens to have some really nice skating rinks. The thing is, being outdoors, most of them are highly temperamental, and thus closed for the majority of the year, and even large parts of winter. Take advantage of a time when they’d most definitely be open and check them out! PPG place downtown has a beautiful rink with lots of great places to eat around. The Schenley Skating Rink is closer to campus and slightly bigger - but seems to be in the middle of nowhere. Going ice skating is a really great date idea. If you are awful at ice skating, adorable hand holding in mittens is a good option. Snuggling to get warm also lends itself to an adorable date factor. That being said, giggling with friends and falling down in big piles is an equally satisfying use of an afternoon and cold temperatures. Check out CBS’ list of best ice skating rinks in Pittsburgh to figure out new ad exciting places to get your ice skating on.
Go to an afternoon indie movie: Get some of that indie cred. Most cinemas offer discounted rates on cold and dreary days. Pull up Rotten Tomatoes, look up something interesting, and go check it out! Especially seeing as it is Oscar season, there’s a ton of really thought provoking small movies currently playing. Some of my recommendations— The Revenant, The Big Short and The Hateful Eight.
Indoors:
Board games: Could there be a better excuse to pull out that old dust-covered Monopoly or Risk game that you have? Get some friends and family together, and collectively obsess over fake money and territory! People will laugh, argue, and yell; someone will probably try to cheat too. Even if some of your crazier friends throw tantrums or board pieces, everyone will be closer by the end of it.
Bake something: Nothing, literally nothing, can beat the smell of freshly baked cookies or a fresh apple pie on a cold and wintry day. Even if you don’t cook much, don’t let the prospect scare you away. Making standard stuff like cookies is easy! Just don’t get distracted by other snowy day things to do while your cookies are in the oven. When they’re ready, pull out that bottle of red wine you’ve been saving, call some friends over, and have a small junk food party.

Howdy Josh,
I'm in a bit of a pickle. This semester, my classes are super duper difficult, like much harder than they were last year, and I've developed a pretty bad habit recently. I'm not doing well in any of my classes, and I feel very unfulfilled most of the time. Every morning, I'm overcome by this crazy dread, and I just really don't want to get out of bed. The cold doesn't help either, since my apartment doesn't have dependable heat, but that's another story for another time. The only way I can pull myself out of bed is to think about all of the ice cream in my fridge. Every day, before I even work through my morning routine, I sit in bed and mentally prepare for the coming day by downing an entire pint of Ben & Jerry's, and I'm not talking the simple flavors, either. I'm talking Phish Food and Chubby Hubby and Half-Baked, man. Then, when I brush my teeth, I just look at all of the chocolate chunks and caramel swirls I'm scrubbing off my teeth, and I just feel really sick. This has been a daily occurrence for the past two weeks, and it's really putting me in a bad frame of mind for the rest of the day — and I know that it's not healthy to have this much dairy in one's diet. What should I do? 
Thanks in advance,
Helplessly Aroused by Zesty English Delicacies 
Dear HAZED (and confused),
I'm sorry you're in such a cycle! The thing about emotional attachments to food is that most, if not all, people have them. Yours, it seems, is brought on by stress and has roots in the need for reward-y feelings. Since you don't seem to be getting those feelings from your class work, I think that you're trying to find it somewhere else, and the easiest thing to do is grab a pint and start eating. I also think that the time frame, in particular, is interesting. The morning is a struggle for a lot of people — especially if you have morning classes which you aren't quite psyched to attend. 
The good thing here is that you're still getting up and doing what you need to do, but moving forward, I think that the solution is to find another reason to get up, or something else that makes you really want to seize the day. Ideally, that wouldn't be something tangible, it'd be some kind of swanky internal motivation, but if you want to slowly wean yourself from the ice cream, you could find an actual bit of breakfast food that you're excited to have — something comfortable and warm and maybe even healthy. When it comes down to it, though, it's all about your own reasons for wanting to get out of bed, and your own motivation for seizing the day.
Peace, love, and puppy-dog tails, 
Josh

To start off the 2016 spring semester, Carnegie Mellon students received an email notifying them that the tuition rates for the 2016-2017 academic year and beyond (until further notice) were recently approved by the Board of Trustees. It was announced that undergraduate tuition has been increased by 3.2 percent.
For a school with an already whopping price tag, this comes as devastating news for many. But maybe having a better understanding of the necessity for these gradual tuition increases and the benefits of them will help to put more meaning behind the numbers.
For current freshmen, sophomores, and juniors, tuition will increase from $49,610 to $51,196. Current seniors, who are part of a five year program, will be slightly spared with a tuition price of $50,690. Next year’s incoming freshmen, however, will face the additional expenses of the $270 orientation fee as well as the standard first year meal plan price of $5,490, bringing their tuition increase to 3.28 percent.
Tuition price was not all that was raised. There are other factors that contribute to the total cost of attendance, most of which faced slight increases as well. Tuition rates for the entire undergraduate student body will be topped off with a $180 transportation fee, a $400 technology fee, an undergraduate activity fee of $254 and a graduate activity fee of $210. Room and board has also been set at $7,780 for a standard double room. The only price that did not change was the media fee which is still its usual $10. 
While the above stated numbers are for the average Carnegie Mellon student, there are two main factors that are sure to vary on a student by student case. Firstly, prices will vary for certain students depending on room and board selections, choosing to opt out of a meal plan etc. Also, the general price stated is, in most cases, not what students end up paying.
Carnegie Mellon has time and again asserted that it is committed to lessening the financial burden of its students through financial aid packages. The University makes it a priority to help provide students with scholarships, fellowships, grants, and other financial support methods. In essence, no one will be forced to pay a fee that is wildly out of their limit.
Knowing that you are attending a highly competitive university is usually attached with the knowledge that there will be a great price tag. In September 2015, U.S. News and World Report ranked the university as number 23 for best national university. It was also ranked seventh for undergraduate business and sixth for undergraduate engineering. The Princeton Review ranked it as the best college for theater. The recognition goes on and on. Attending a competitive school with such high recognition, in the long run, allows many students to reap the benefits of money spent on tuition now later on in their future careers.
Tuition increases, such as these, are often necessary in order to uphold the prestige and the overall rewarding college experience that is provided to us as members of the Carnegie Mellon community. It is believed that the amount of energy, time, and money that is put in to our college careers will be returned to us years later. Our tuition money is directed towards sustaining rigorous programs for competitive students as well as acquiring some of the best faculty members, in addition to maintaining and expanding educational facilities. Without any of this, we would be at a serious disadvantage at attaining the best education possible.

In honoring the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Carnegie Mellon University’s Black Graduate Student Organization arranged a discussion panel last Wednesday to address what it is like being black and involved in the media. 
In attendance were: Tony Atkins, digital content producer for WPXI-TV Pittsburgh, Kyshira Moffett, creator of thisishermovement.com and Damon Young, creator of verysmartbrothas.com. In a second portion of the event, these individuals were joined by Clarece Polke, a reporting fellow at the Washington bureau at Reuters, and Tory Parrish, president of the Pittsburgh Black Media Federation. Each of the panelists has established themselves professionally in the media, either online or on television, and was open to discussing both the obstacles and the successes they faced in their journalistic pursuits. Kristin Warren, a doctoral student in mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and president of the Black Graduate Student Organization, acted as moderator.
The panelists were first asked about their beginnings in the media world and how they climbed to the positions of power they are in now. Moffett talked about her passion for writing, saying “Initially, I started a blog for finding jobs. Then I launched another blog, rebranded a couple times while I was trying to find myself. ‘This is #hermovement’ is the newest rebranding. Now, it’s a voice for millennial professionals who care about their work – a media site to normalize black women who are not stereotyped in other media.” Atkins added that as a child he really enjoyed visual storytelling and drawing. He stated, “At first, I wanted to go into politics and be a politician, but being a journalist allows you to go into multi-faceted interests. So I studied sports journalism, and from there I went to the newspaper, the news, and now TV.” Finally, Young discussed his transition from being the associate editor for his school newspaper to becoming a high school English teacher to then running his own business at Dusquene University. “I started a personal blog, became friends with another blogger and created ‘verysmartbrothas.com.’ During the recession, I got laid off at Duquesne, but my blog continued to grow,” Young said.
The panelists were then asked to address the difficulties faced by people of color when trying to impede the media industry. Young believes that the answer to this depends on what type of media is being considered. “There is never a better time than now to go into what you want,” Young said. “There are all types of people who have voices and a platform. You need to find a way to separate from the bullshit and what’s real and what makes sense. If you’re a person of color who has an interest in media, there are literally dozens of ways to do that. Go to school, be a social media star, or just try your best to excel in your passion.”
Agreeing with Young, Moffett added that “the biggest thing is defining who you want to be. Separate who you see from your authenticity. What is your expertise and niche, passion and outlet, what can’t you stop talking about?” Atkins added his own anecdote about working in sports media in Milwaukee, describing it as being like “the good ol’ boys.” “More often than not, the guys that were ‘in’ were old white dudes who didn’t want to let go of their positions. After nearly a year, I felt more tolerated than wanted at my first internship, so I decided to leave, and join my friend’s blog called ‘bucksketball.com' and ‘acmepackingcompany.com' and I blogged and built a following through nontraditional media. I was writing and exercising those muscles when I graduated. I saw a door and I broke it down, but sometimes you have to go around it.” Young continued, “just because there are less barriers to entry now, doesn’t mean there aren’t obstacles. As you continue to ascend in certain media, there are glass ceilings for people of color and women, say, The New York Times. There are people of color everywhere else, but once you start going into those boardrooms where people are buying and making decisions, you’ll start seeing less of people of color. There is a perception that because it’s by a black person, it’s less reliable.”
Now, given the panelists’ respective struggles, Warren inquired what each media personality felt about their following, and what truly defines the meaning of “success.” “Brand creation is more of an art than an actual science,” Young said. “I can’t think of a specific point where I thought I made it, it’s just an organic feeling where certain things happen and certain opportunities continue to come. It has to do more with engagement and opportunities through your work.” Atkins added that “engagement is definitely very important.” “Try to relay any information to your friends,” he said. “I think people follow me because I’m the newsperson that’s not traditionally uptight, I try to be friendly and outgoing in my tweets and reply back and connect back, as opposed to being a stiff-type celebrity.” Additionally, Moffett noted that the most important aspects of influence are authenticity and consistency. “I didn’t expect my blog to be a business but my blog was getting customers. I know I have a good following because if I don’t post, I know people miss me. When people recognize you for your work and have taken your advice, this shows that your brand is sustainable. Therefore, it’s important to take opportunities from it. My writing gives me opportunities to talk, which is very interesting.”
At this point in the event, the audience was open to ask their own questions. One member asked whether each of the personalities felt that they were a spokesperson for a specific group or if they’ve broken the barrier for anyone of other demographics. Young responded, “My blog is a very unique style of humor, satire, style, etc. By being who we are, it has made us more popular. People who aren’t in our targeted demographic know where to find it. It’s like the cheesecake factory, you have so much on the menu. Those types of media outlets do exist, but if you don’t have that type of bank, then the best thing is to be very, very direct and specific to your goals and your brand.” Atkins agreed, noting “that different news outlets cater to different demographics.” Moffett added her own personal experience with her website. She stated “for instance, ‘bombshellbranding' is geared towards women, but I’ve had five men come to me. I’ve had a lot of men feel comfortable with coming to events. My content blogging definitely helps with that.”
Finally, in light of recent discussions surrounding the Oscar nominations, Warren inquired as to whether any of the panelists felt strongly regarding the lack of nomination of people of color in the Oscars. She surprisingly received very opposing responses. Atkins replied, “as someone who had to create his own thing to get in, I never would care. But if I was Will Smith in the Oscars, I wouldn’t boycott it, because I would never really care”. On the other hand, Young felt differently. “These awards are valuable. They give you name recognition, help your personal brand, and allow you to increase what they can command (from 2 to 10 million per movie)” said Young. “You cannot minimize the value and psychic benefit of being recognized.”
Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article said that Clarence Polke was present in the initial portion of the event and was the founder of verysmartbrothers.com, rather than Damon Young, who founded verysmartbrothas.com.

Dear readers of The Tartan,
In the last issue of 2015, we published a series of letters to the editor about the black student experience at Carnegie Mellon. When these letters were published, it was brought to our attention that the letters had been edited in the production process, which is both against our policy and highly unethical. Though the editing was an innocent mistake that resulted from a training gap, it is regrettable and unacceptable. The message of the letters was altered when the letters were edited without the permission of the authors. We at The Tartan are deeply sorry that this happened, and are taking all of the necessary steps to ensure that it will not happen again.
The letters to the editor we publish are intended to be a platform from which student voices from our community can be heard. By editing the letters, The Tartan violated the trust of the student body. In light of this, we, Brian Trimboli and Laura Scherb, Editor-in-Chief and Publisher, respectively, would like to reiterate the revised letter to the editor policy, which is effective immediately: “Letters must be submitted by 5 p.m. on the Wednesday before publication by mail or to forum@thetartan.org. Letters from within the university community take precedence. Letters intended for publication must be signed and include the author’s address and telephone number for verification; letters must not exceed 350 words. No edits will be made to any published letters without the author’s permission; in the case of no response from the author, The Tartan reserves the right to postpone the publication of the letter. Authors’ names may be withheld from publication upon request. The Tartan reserves the right to reject any letter.”
On behalf of the entire staff of The Tartan, we would like to apologize again for our actions regarding these letters to the editor. It was never our intention to silence a voice or change a narrative, and we hope that we can regain the trust of the student body in light of these actions.
Sincerely,
Laura Scherb, Publisher, 2015
Brian Trimboli, Editor-in-Chief, 2015
Addendum: 
As the new Tartan leadership, it is important to us that our letter to the editor policy be sustainable moving forward. We do not intend to return to our flawed original policy, but in the coming weeks, we will consult with industry professionals and legal aid in order to solidify a new policy that best benefits both The Tartan and the Carnegie Mellon community. We welcome continued discussion and will gladly meet with anyone who wishes to further discuss our course of action in this matter. The campus community will be promptly informed of any future changes to our policy. In the interim, the changes to the policy will stand as written above. Our main goal is to ensure that letters to the editor remain an effective platform for student and community voices.
Sincerely,
Sarah Gutekunst, Publisher
Claire Gianakas, Editor-in-Chief
Jade Crockem, Operations Manager

Last Thursday, Heinz College hosted a talk for its Leadership Lecture Series, which featured Paul Mango, the director of the Pittsburgh office of McKinsey & Company, a global management consulting firm. Mango spoke about his journey through West Point, Harvard Business School, and the U.S. Army before he joined McKinsey over twenty years ago, as well as what he had learned about leadership along the way.
Starting at his roots, Mango spoke about being a second-generation American and growing up in an Italian, Irish Catholic family in Syracuse, New York in the sixties. As the fourth child of his parents, Mango quipped that he was “basically unsupervised,” and developed a close relationship with his siblings. Mango described his background as “very traditional, but relatively lower middle class.”
As a kid, Mango spent his time playing basketball and baseball. In high school, Mango initially believed that his skills in baseball would allow him to become a professional player, paying no attention to academics. However, a sports injury during his sophomore year caused him to start considering other options for his future. Later, he reflected that the injury was “the first best thing that happened in my life.”
The second self-described “serendipity” to occur in Mango’s life was getting into West Point, in that “it was immediately post-Vietnam, and almost no one wanted to go.” It was a five year obligation, and there was only one degree offered at the time – general engineering. Having to attend class six days a week, Mango had to learn how to study, in addition to receiving training as a cadet, describing how “we all took the same course, every day, as a class, which was actually very good.”
After graduating from West Point, Mango joined the best unit in the army at the time, the 82nd Airborne Division. Its mission was “to be anywhere in the world in 48 hours,” which involved intense and comprehensive training and logistics. According to Mango, “it was a very exciting place, because from a leadership perspective, they ask 22 and 23-year-old lieutenants to take 30 people in a platoon, fly them halfway across the world, and make sure they had enough spare socks in their rucksacks to last for two weeks. You were kind of half den mother…but also had to be very cognizant of all the things associated with the mission.”
Mango’s second assignment was in Germany, years before the Berlin Wall came down, at a time when the buildup of military power had already peaked and was starting to become unnecessary. It was at that point that Mango decided to apply to Harvard Business School. It was a “radically different learning experience” compared to West Point, according to Mango, but was still a “great experience.” Mango described that “at West Point, it was very simple…if you did your homework and you studied, you’d probably do okay. At Harvard, it’s complete ambiguity ... there’s no right answer, there’s no wrong answer, and 50 percent of your grade is based on class participation.”
After Harvard, Mango moved to Pittsburgh to join McKinsey & Company in 1988. In the ‘90s, McKinsey underwent a radical change, transforming from a generalist model built around serving local clients to a “model built around expertise that had to be projected anywhere in the country or anywhere in the world.” Mango chose to specialize in health care. There was no health care practice at McKinsey at the time, but McKinsey started to serve health care clients, and so Mango helped organize the health care practice. Mango explained that “in 15 to 18 years, [the health care practice] went from nonexistent to about 15 to 20 percent of what McKinsey does ... globally.”
Reflecting on his journey, Mango commented on the serendipity in his life. In terms of how he made life decisions, he stated, “the one thing I knew was, whatever field I was going into, I wanted to be part of the best organization in that field.” His advice was not to be “overly fastidious” in how to make decisions, and to look at the quality of the organization in its field and to go for it.
Mango then spoke about the five things he learned about leadership. The first one occurred at a McKinsey partner meeting, in which the Prime Minister of Israel said something that stuck with Mango: “Let me tell you what I think leadership is about. It’s not about being on top, it’s about being out in front.”
“It’s important to understand, it’s not about hierarchy. It’s not about using authority to influence people, it’s about demonstrating through example that they want to follow you,” Mango explained.
The second thing Mango learned about leadership was that leaders have to “selflessly invest in their people’s development.” Mango mentioned an experience from West Point in which the platoon leader responsible for training his group of cadets, despite constantly calling them deadbeats, “really did care about us and his mission. He understood his mission was to make us capable, competent young soldiers, and that’s how he spent all his time. And we realized that ... no matter what he said to us.”
Mango added that “the people that join McKinsey have extremely high development aspirations, so we spend a lot of time on their programs, on their careers, on their advancement, and giving them probably too much feedback … it takes a lot of time, but it’s well worth it.”
The third lesson in leadership dealt with integrity, although Mango clarified that “leaders have integrity, but it’s not just honesty, it’s not just ethics … there’s also consistency and reliability. Think about integrity in a very broad sense.”
Mango’s fourth point in leadership was that “leaders dampen, they don’t amplify anxiety.” He said that “leadership is not just about how you act all day, but it’s particularly when you’re under stress.”
Mango also noted that “we think good leaders are fundamentally optimistic; not unrealistically optimistic, but optimistic.” 
Mentioning an incident in which a managing director at McKinsey was forced to fire a regional leader for being pessimistic, he explained that “it’s the whole demeanor that you bring to a leadership role that is quite important, and people do notice. And they respond very favorably to, again, not unrealistic optimism, but certainly optimism.”

Students from Carnegie Mellon were among those to attend the Career and Internship Connections (CIC) event earlier this month. The conference, held in major cities across the country, took place between Jan. 4 and Jan. 6, and included undergraduate students from a range of schools. 18 institutions were represented in total, including Johns Hopkins University, Washington University in St. Louis, Tufts University, and Carnegie Mellon University.
The event first began in 1999, founded on the principle of “bringing students to the employer.” 
The event is specifically designed for students pursuing career and internship opportunities in business and the social sciences, and to a lesser extent healthcare and hospitality. Rather than making numerous campus visits, employers can meet with large numbers of students who are home over break near major metropolitan areas. Also, many of the companies hiring operate out of the respective city, which would be ideal for students who are looking to work or intern from home.
Drawing on the success of the original event in New York City, additional events were started in Boston, Washington D.C., and Los Angeles. Now, the organization garners nearly 5000 student applications. New York, host to the largest event, brings in about 750 students and 95 employers every year. 
The CIC attracts a large number of students because it offers same-day interviews. Students must submit their resumes to prospective employers a month ahead of time, while additionally registering for the interviews. They meet with the employers after the career fair for a half-hour time slot, either in a group with others or individually. For students who did not sign up for interviews prior to the Nov. 30 deadline, around 20 to 40 spaces are typically left open for employers to offer last-minute interviews on the day of the event.
The day is organized into two parts: a morning career fair and afternoon interviews. Employers table with at least two to three recruiters, who interact with students and disseminate information about the company. Companies are divided into rooms based on what category they fall under, such as financial services, healthcare, or nonprofits.
Although the best chances of landing a job or internship position are with the same-day interviews, many companies at the CIC do not offer interviews and may reach out to students later after screening their resumes. Companies often have separate recruiting processes and may refer conference attendees to separate application processes. Employers at the CIC are very diverse in makeup, ranging from renowned nonprofits like Sloan Kettering Cancer Research Hospital to high-power investment banks with billions of dollars under management like Black Rock.
The Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC) at Carnegie Mellon is a great resource to prepare for events like the CIC. 
Starting with the resume, the CPDC can help students prepare for job interviews and career fairs. The CPDC has resume guidelines on their website, which are department-specific and a great place to start out. Other services include resume checking, career counseling, and mock interviews. Events similar to the CIC take place on campus throughout the year, and most require just a Carnegie Mellon ID to enter. Additionally, TartanTrak is also an online resource for Carnegie Mellon students searching for jobs and internships.
One of the greatest benefits of going to career fairs, in addition to the prospect of getting a job, is the networking opportunities. Many of the hiring managers of companies return year after year to the same conference. 
Bill Burke, the vice president of marketing at CBS consumer products, said that he recalls meeting students who built their resumes based on the advice he gave them at the CIC. For many employers, going to career fairs is a good way to keep in touch with students and offer them tips on how to be better candidates for companies. Often, if students are not qualified for the job, recruiters will hand out business cards as a way to stay in touch.
This year’s CIC was another success, providing hundreds of students with internships and job opportunities. The knowledge gained from attending these events is invaluable, and is surely a great learning experience for many.

National Academy of Sciences honors Anderson for learning technology
Carnegie Mellon’s John R. Anderson has dedicated a life of research to developing a unified theory of cognition and using it to create cognitive-based tutors. For his successful work in developing such tutors, the National Academy of Sciences will award Anderson the 2016 Atkinson Prize in Psychological and Cognitive Sciences for his “foundational contributions to systematic theory and optimality analysis in cognitive and psychological science and for developing effective, theory-based cognitive tutors for education,” according to a university press release.
The prize includes $100,000 and a gold-plated bronze medal, which Anderson will receive at the Academy’s annual meeting on Sunday, May 1 in Washington D.C. This year’s other winner of the prize, which goes to two researchers every two years, is Stanford University’s Carol S. Dwek.
“John’s work on the ACT cognitive model is at the heart of intelligent tutoring systems, an innovation that is benefiting hundreds of thousands of students and continues to be a major area of research at Carnegie Mellon,” said Anind Dey, director of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute. “This latest and very significant honor for John is fitting and well-deserved.”
CMU scientists appear in Werner Herzog documentary
At the 2016 Sundance Film Festival, Werner Herzog will premiere his latest film. Herzog’s documentary, “Lo & Behold: Reveries of the Connected World,” will explore society’s dependence on the internet for almost everything.
Of course, there’s no better place to see interconnectivity in action than at Carnegie Mellon. Herzog and his production crew visited Carnegie Mellon’s campuses in both Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley last spring, and even included Carnegie Mellon researchers in the final cut of the film.
The film has been described as a “playful yet chilling examination of our rapidly interconnecting online lives,” and includes a “treasure trove of interviews of strange and beguiling individuals, ranging from Internet pioneers to victims of wireless radiation, whose anecdotes and reflections weave together a complex portrait of our brave new world,” according to a university press release.
The most recent trailer for “Lo & Behold” includes video of the National Robotic Engineering Center’s CHIMP robot, an interview with professor of psychology Marcel Just, and an interview with Joydeep Biswas, a former post-doctoral researcher in the Computer Science Department.

The culture of Youtube beauty gurus has exploded and surpasses the viewership of many forms of traditional media. These gurus are generally entrepreneurial women in their twenties trying to get in on the oversaturated beauty genre of new media. As role models in a platform that allows for greater diversity, they ideally offer the potential for expanding the concept of beauty, but also the potential to reinforce negative values from the beauty industry in a space where the audience tends to be especially vulnerable. Leading content creators, despite their limited diversity, appear to be attempting to change the culture of fashion and beauty to be about having fun and as expressions of self confidence, rather than making them the source of self esteem.
The women who do stand out owe their fame in part to luck and good timing, but also because they were able to differentiate themselves through what they call “lifestyle vlogging.” What that means is that as much as the videos are about the quality of product reviews and tutorials, they build the fame of the beauty gurus around a cult of personality. Branding themselves as a friend or big sister who gives you beauty tips, relationship advice, and encouragement creates trust and loyalty within their fans. 
The success of this branding is evident in the amount of press these young women get. Ingrid Nilsen recently met with President Barack Obama to discuss issues important to her fan base; Zoella broke sale records with her new line of beauty products; Tanya Burr was on the cover of Glamour magazine; their meet and greets bring together young people from all over the world; and the list of high-profile achievements goes on and on.
Given the influence of the beauty gurus, a lot of people are beginning to question what kind of impact they have on young girls. The beauty industry is notoriously toxic for young girls, given that their marketing strategy involves establishing insecurity by displaying unattainable standards of beauty as the norm. Photoshopped bikini bodies and poreless skin create a false need for diet pills and makeup, conflating beauty with success, self worth, and likeability. The world basically tells young girls that you have to look like Karlie Kloss to be worthy of relationships and friends, and if you don’t look like her, then you’d better start investing in products to make yourself look conventionally attractive. And while our media and society also promote ridiculous standards of masculinity as well, in general they aren’t specifically targeted by the beauty industry in the same way. Part of the industry’s marketing is creating a rigid gender divide that expects women to be more concerned about fixing their appearance. 
Growing concern of the effect this has on young girls’ self images has led to a slew of studies on media and self-objectification — the tendency for women to view themselves based on what others would see and be attracted to — which generally conclude that these influences are strongly correlated with depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. The problems with beauty, fashion, and diet industries are pretty well known and established, so the question that needs to be answered now is to what degree does the beauty guru culture subvert the more traditional culture of beauty.
Where YouTube and other forms of new media appear to have power is in their democratic approach to media. Anyone can publish anything that they want, as long as they use a Taylor Swift song. And this illusion that anyone can make it as a YouTube star is interesting because on one hand it does allow, in theory, for greater diversity in terms of representation, but it can also be an illusion. 
In reality, the vast majority of the biggest beauty gurus are young, thin, white, cisgender, heterosexual women. So when you watch lifestyle advice or “A Day in My Life” on YouTube, what you get is repetition of a lifestyle that is predicated on being conventionally pretty and wealthy enough to buy organic foods and mountains of lip gloss. It means that if a person of color goes online to watch a haul video (videos where people show and tell about their recent shopping purchases), chances are they’ll be watching someone expound on the trendiness of “tribal prints” and kimonos. Tribal prints, by the way, generally refer to fabric prints inspired from South American designs, African fabric, and Indian woodblock printed fabric. 
The fascination with the Bohemian and ignorance of other cultures is concerning, and at times genuinely confusing, but it is a reflection of the way that fashion in the Western world is being marketed. Similarly, the values presented in boyfriend advice videos and workout tutorials and “What I Eat in a Day” videos display the same cultural expectations of normal that old media presented, just in a more personalized, and insidious, way. In general, these videos tend to be well intentioned, but it is concerning that there is a message that these videos are about real people keeping it real. People think the lives and values portrayed in these videos are the norm, when they are often unattainable. 
On the other hand, in comparison to traditional media, there is actually some diversity in the representation of beauty, gender expression, and health. Michelle Phan is probably the queen of beauty gurus, but in the traditional fashion and beauty industry she may not have been able to have her career because of her race. 
Estée Lalonde and SprinkleofGlitter  (also known as Louise Pentland), for example, talk about their own struggles with body image while also showing their audiences that they love their body and feel good in it. Louise Pentland especially fills the need to talk about body image and beauty, as she has released a line of beautiful plus sized clothing and several fun, glamorous lookbooks to counter the perception that being plus sized should mean that you can’t be beautiful. SunKissAlba's channel talks about sustainability and organic products, but also describes a beauty regime that would be more specific to people of color. 
Kaushal Beauty makes makeup tutorials for both Indian and Western events, which is helpful because she uses colors that are more flattering on brown people.
Ingrid Nilsen is a huge lifestyle vlogger who not only is biracial, but also publicly came out last year. This was huge for a lot of people because it was a way for a lot of people to see that identifying as a lesbian while also being feminine, fashionable, not white, beautiful, and ultimately the same person is okay and even normal. You see this a lot with new media representation of LGBTQA+ individuals; often the most powerful way of breaking down stereotypes and building self acceptance in marginalized groups is showing people just living their life and being happy.
All of these YouTubers have huge audiences, and although it is generally not the case that people of marginalized groups have as large of a fan base, their ability to reach a lot of people with their identity is important. It is no less important that anyone can find small YouTubers who put out messages about diversity in self love and beauty that more or less align with their own identity — and that is something that is special about YouTube, vlogging, and specifically lifestyle videos.
Beyond increased representation, what distinguishes the beauty guru platform from traditional media is how personal the content is. To a lot of young girls, these women are like big sisters or best friends who they ask for advice on fashion, boys, cooking, confidence, and how to be healthy. Whether you look at the love that came in response to Zoella’s videos about her panic disorder and managing anxiety, Ingrid Nilsen’s videos about periods, or Tanya Burr’s daily vlogs, you see these women building a really strong relationship with their fans. 
This turns out to be a really good thing because it allows these women to give advice on topics that are generally taboo or ignored, but are really important for young women to talk about. But while their popularity is built in part on their charisma and caring, their channels are also built on a trust for the products they use and review. And that’s actually how most of the beauty gurus make money — companies pay to have their products in their video. The top three beauty guru’s make an average of $33,000 a month.
In a best case scenario, that means that these women will work out deals that will allow them to be paid to show only the products they actually want to recommend, and their audiences will be more loyal because of that. But the biggest issue people have with the beauty guru culture is the idea of these young fans who unquestioningly trust these women who are on some level making videos to advertise for a variety of brands. With that kind of adoration and influence, there is a possibility that they are teaching young girls consumerism and superficiality. 
These videos are a replacement for fashion magazines, and it’s questionable whether young women take away a different message. The increased representation does mean that there are certain messages —especially about what a woman’s body should look like — that become less popularized. But these videos are still supporting consumerism in an idyllic setting, with twinkly lights and floral bedspreads. 
A lifestyle vlogger, in theory, should also be talking about fiscal responsibility, sustainability, and what a relationship with material possession should look like as well as what a makeup routine and outfit should be. In the same way that a lot of white beauty bloggers disregard the roots of the clothing they wear and the cultural context of their outfits, a lot of these women are not considering the environmental impact or ethical responsibility of the clothing they buy. Considering that most drugstore brands test on animals, and many factories that make the hot new thing in fashion barely pay their employees, it is hard to separate the problems from the potential good these beauty bloggers can do. 
There is also the question of what this teaches people who may not feel conventionally attractive, but also don’t have the money to buy beauty products and new clothes. It does appear to tell people that you can be confident, and having all this stuff is a really easy way to feel good about yourself. Telling people to buy products — even if they are actually good — for the advertising dollars just seems like an oversight on the part of YouTubers of the culture that they are creating.
Hauls, for example, are a particularly controversial form of lifestyle vlog. In hauls, users go shopping and earn a few million views showing everyone what they bought for themselves. And when successful YouTubers get paid to do haul promotions or advertorials, it can come across as showing off or narcissistic or, at the very least, far removed from most people’s financial reality. Depending on the way a channel is branded, haul videos  can frankly appear shallow. It is important to not need to be validated by what you own and how you look, and that’s sometimes difficult because these things are tied in with likeability and social status.
What’s most important here is that we keep having conversations about how we view makeup and fashion’s role in society. In feminist circles, the question remains: can makeup and fashion be empowering? Is there something negative in cultivating a love for sparkly eyeshadows and flowy dresses? It is worth noting that the idea of cultivating a love for beauty products out of self love rather than insecurity is hugely important, and a wonderful side effect of beauty guru culture on YouTube. 
You’d be hard pressed to find a lifestyle vlogger that hasn’t talked about self confidence, body image, or how makeup is more decoration than substance. In most cases, these videos are actually about how women appropriate something that might be seen as oppressive as a way to express themselves and make themselves feel good, regardless of what that boy or anyone else thinks.
If young girls and women are modeling their lifestyles after what is presented in their videos, the hope is that they pick up these messages as well. The genre is new and open enough that people are talking about these things, about living with less and what life is outside of the framework of beauty.
If the last few years of YouTube culture have shown us anything, it’s that a smart, thoughtful content creator is more than the brands they work for or promote. It may not be obvious to a casual viewer or to someone who isn’t part of the beauty guru audience, but ultimately what sells is this relationship they have with their viewers who look up to them, but also hold them accountable. On the one hand, the toxicity of the beauty industry didn’t magically disappear because Zoella went on camera and went through her day without makeup. On the other, though, there is now this experience where girls process breakups by watching Kayley Melissa’s  tutorials and braiding each other’s hair, wind down from a long work day by watching pamper routines, or just feel a little more validated in their own expressions of beauty.

Across the nation, movie fans are furious. This is a country that is drained from decades of struggle against culturally-induced racism: job discrimination, racial profiling, white privilege, and similar issues. But this is also a country that loves to watch movies. So when our injustice is illuminated by the bright lights of Hollywood, the response is ferocious.
The list of nominees for the 2016 Academy Awards has incited outrage due to its lack of diversity, resulting in the indignant #OscarsSoWhite that has spread across social media. The all-white cast of Oscar nominees has caused many popular figures, such as director Spike Lee and actress Jada Pinkett-Smith, to speak out against this racial uniformity or to declare a boycott against the Oscars.
However, racism is a multi-layered prejudice. We are all aware of the fight against conscious racism. Conscious racism has been rampant throughout most of American history, scrawled across urban walls and federal laws alike. Yet while conscious racism is no longer culturally accepted, a more current type of racism is its lingering, still very potent, remainder: subconscious racism. A hidden, quiet form of flickering racism born, perhaps, in childhood exposure to cultural stereotypes or thought patterns; living within an unknowing host. This form of prejudice is much more subtle, and in that way, just as dangerous. This is the discrimination that dwells in “Oreo” jokes and hoodies, traffic tickets, and police bullets.
No conscientious American would consider themselves to be racist. Police officers deny racial profiling, but it persists anyway. This is because officers aren’t targeting people who are black, they’re targeting people who seem suspicious. But the reasoning process that determines who’s suspicious and who isn’t occurs at a subconscious level, which is where the racial profiling takes place. Of course, this does not apply to all police officers, just as it doesn’t apply to all plumbers or teachers. Yet it applies to enough officers to statistically over-target black citizens – and offend many black Americans.
What we should all understand, however, is this: if this subtle form of racism is unconscious, it may also be considered unintentional.
In the same way, the Academy Award members did not intentionally choose an all-white cast. It takes 300 members to make a nomination. It is likely that few of them—or perhaps none of them—actively chose to nominate only white actors. But this is more likely: many of these voters grew up watching prolific, accomplished, and white celebrities such as Tom Hanks or Meryl Streep, and perhaps they’ve unconsciously internalized the image of an “Oscar winner” as a white actor or actress. Thus, when faced with selecting Oscar nominees, they may perhaps tend to—without conscious thought—give added weight to a white actor or actress, merely because the white actor fits their expectations of the image of an Oscar nominee. Perhaps.
This racial homogeneity is a result of years of cultural programming. These Academy Award members, just like many Americans, may be well balanced, open-minded, kind, and tolerant. But they may still harbor unconscious racial prejudice—and weren’t even aware of it. Until now. 
After a week of intense criticism from celebrities and fans alike, the Academy “approved a sweeping series of substantive changes”—in their own words—to diversify their membership. By 2020, they intend to double the number of female and minority votes. They hope that these changes will result in non-whites composing 14 percent and women composing 48 percent of their membership.
The response to this carefully-designed proclamation has been generally positive. While some still view these changes as inadequate or only an act of self-preservation, many appreciate the bold efforts. April Reign, the former attorney and managing editor of BroadwayBlack.com and creator of #OscarsSoWhite, said that she is “very encouraged” by the changes. She also stressed the need “to put pressure on the Hollywood studio heads to make more inclusive and diverse films, because the academy can only nominate quality work that has been made.”
So while this uniquely glamorous case of subconscious racism has received positive actions towards its elimination, the environment in which it was born still requires more forceful changes—changes that cannot be made by rewriting policy. When the origin of such prejudice lives in the American subconscious, it cannot be altered by only hashtags and celebrity boycotts. True change will only result from the education of this country as a whole, encouraging support of minorities’ films and roles to pervade society more than this archaic prejudice already has.

On Monday, Dec. 21, the Pittsburgh City Council voted 7-2 to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana. Before the law was passed, marijuana possession was punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine. Now, when police catch someone in possession of under 30 grams of marijuana, they will confiscate the drug and assess up to a $100 fine. No jail time.
The Pittsburgh City Council made the right decision, and they deserve recognition and praise for it. At the same time, we should demand even more from our city council and our elected officials at all levels of government: full legalization.
Legalizing marijuana nationwide would save taxpayers billions of dollars on the futile War on Drugs. Every year, federal, state, and local governments spend as much as $50 billion policing drug use, especially marijuana, especially marijuana. Imagine if we could instead use that money to build new schools, fix America’s crumbling infrastructure, or even reinvest it into drug prevention and addiction treatment programs. That’s to say nothing of the additional tax revenue that a legal marijuana market would generate. According to a study by the Cato Institute, legalizing marijuana would generate $8.7 billion in tax revenue. Legalization would also empower police to address real matters of public safety. Decriminalization and legalization enable police to focus less on low-level offenders and focus more on dealers, gangs, and cartels, forces that really do harm the public and deserve undivided attention.
Pittsburgh’s move to decriminalize marijuana will keep people out of already crowded jails. The United States incarcerates more of its own citizens than any other country, even China, an authoritarian state with over three times as many citizens. As many as 50% of America’s prisoners are nonviolent offenders, usually for drug possession. Legalizing marijuana nationwide would keep millions of people from going to prison every year, and can save lives, communities, and money.
Perhaps the most important reason to support legalization, though, is the clear racism in the way marijuana use is policed. Let’s face it, a lot of white, middle-class kids at Carnegie Mellon smoke marijuana, but I doubt that many Carnegie Mellon students worried much about getting a $500 fine for possession. According to a  2013 study by the ACLU, even though white people and black people use marijuana at the same rate, black people are four times more likely to be arrested for possessing marijuana than other groups. For white people, using marijuana comes with a slap on the wrist. For black people, it can derail your entire life. While decriminalization is a step forward towards equal treatment, the fine can still be applied to perpetuate systemic racism. Decriminalization and legalization help ensure that the law is applied fairly to everyone.
Pittsburgh took a huge step forward when City Council voted to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana. The move will save taxpayers money, make the streets safer, depopulate jails, and promote racial justice. However, while we applaud City Council, we must acknowledge that any journey is more than the first step forward. Now that we have forward momentum, we must work even harder to make marijuana legal.

By staying silent and not demanding to be informed, the student body is relinquishing control over their money, institution, and the form their education takes.
The tuition hikes announced last week did not come as a shock to anyone, but the resounding lack of response should have. Carnegie Mellon has been consistently raising its tuition by around 3 percent for the past five years. Looking at the same five years, I can find no evidence of mass protests against these increases, or demanding fiscal transparency from the university. There are, of course, valid and important reasons to raise tuition, but Carnegie Mellon does not provide detailed information about where the money is going, leaving students in the dark. By staying silent and not demanding to be informed, the student body is relinquishing control over their money, institution, and the form their education takes.
No one would argue that running a top-tier academic institution is cheap. There are salaries to be paid, both to faculty and staff, facilities to be built and maintained, equipment to be bought, and research projects to be funded. Obtaining enough funds to keep the university running and improving is particularly difficult here at Carnegie Mellon due to a remarkably small endowment of $1.599 billion in 2014. Carnegie Mellon is a young university, so it has not had the time to accumulate the massive endowments that back schools like Stanford and MIT. At the same time, Carnegie Mellon is rivaling with these universities for students and faculty. This leaves the school struggling to keep pace in terms of salaries, benefits, and facilities, all on a lower budget. Tuition needs to be raised so that Carnegie Mellon can stay competitive. This argument seems to hold water. Everyone who is going here wants the best education possible, and even improvements that don’t directly affect us add prestige and value to our degrees.
However, it is all a question of balance. Prestige and quality education are all well and good, but they only benefit people who can afford them. Carnegie Mellon should be trying to improve, but not at the cost of students being able to attend or their families being able to maintain financial security. Next year the class of 2017 will pay $50,690 in tuition. When they committed to Carnegie Mellon in the fall of 2012 their tuition was $45,760. Families made decisions and fiscal plans based on the 2012 number, and are now having to find an extra $4,930. This is a problem for every year in our school. My year, the class of 2018, is already facing a tuition bill that is $3,166 more than when we started, and that is before food and housing costs are accounted for.
I have heard a few responses justifying these increases for people who are already committed to the school. The first argument, that comes almost exclusively from other members of the student body, is that if people don’t want to pay the increase they can leave Carnegie Mellon. The issue with this argument is that it turns Carnegie Mellon into a place only accessible to people with thousands of dollars to spare, and that it discounts the lives, connections, and plans that people have built in their time at Carnegie Mellon. The second argument, frequently cited in newspaper interviews with college administrations, is that tuition increases are necessary to keep up with inflation. The issue with this is that tuition increases in the past decade have not reflected inflation. In 2006 Carnegie Mellon tuition was $34,180. According to the US Inflation Calculator if tuition had simply been keeping up with inflation it should have been $40,184 in 2015, a full $10,000 less than tuition for the 2015–2016 academic year. Clearly, there is something else at work.
The “something else” would seem to be increasing operating expenses, which, for example, grew by 3.1 percent or $32.1 million in 2013 according to the 2014 Financial Report. Much of this was covered by a $28.5 million increase in revenue from tuition and other educational fees, net of financial aid. In the report, operating expenses are broken down into six categories: instruction and departmental research, sponsored projects, administration and institutional support, academic support, student services, and auxiliary services and activities. I could not find a more detailed breakdown of the spending. Perhaps there is a more detailed breakdown available. Perhaps everything that is in each of those categories is completely necessary and something we as students should be supporting. Perhaps every dollar of extra tuition we pay is directly contributing to a better academic environment for us, now, and not only for future students. However, the information necessary to make those calls isn’t easily available to the student body so we cannot make informed decisions or have any kind of say about where our money goes.
The most startling thing about all of this is the extreme lack of protest on campus. While some amount of tuition increase is probably necessary, there are many things that can be done to make them more fair and equitable, and perhaps smaller. We could protest for financial transparency so that students can ensure that money is being spent on things they want and care about. We could demand that tuition be fixed when you enter Carnegie Mellon, so that each student pays the same cost all four years, allowing families to make informed financial plans. Or we could petition for better financial-aid opportunities for students already enrolled in Carnegie Mellon, such as the right to apply for the new merit scholarships that were made available to incoming students last year to account for the rise in tuition but barred to those already enrolled.
Carnegie Mellon students were not always so willing to accept cost increases. In 2009 students throughout Pittsburgh, including at Carnegie Mellon, signed petitions and attended city council meetings to protest a proposed one percent tax on tuition. Why should we fight against a 1 percent increase in tuition cost, but not a 3.2 percent one? As a campus, we need to take a stand on tuition and create a dialogue with the administration about the purposes, processes, and expectations for tuition increases.

Frustrated Democrats have brought a laundry list of complaints against Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz for her conduct as Chairwoman since 2011. And recently, these frustrations have boiled over into the call for her resignation as chairwoman of the DNC. The allegations brought against her reflect not only the possibility that she is personally biased towards Hillary Clinton, but also her failure to unite and lead the Democratic party.
Prior to the firestorm that began to rage surrounding the 2016 primaries, Wasserman-Schultz received heavy criticism for leading the democrats to two consecutive, significant congressional losses. In 2012, Democrats managed to hang on to the majority in the Senate, but maintained the minority in the House. With the loss of both the House and the Senate in 2014, however, Democrat progress has been held at a standstill. President Obama cannot pass meaningful progressive change without the help of Congress; he can only continue to threaten veto against the progress that has already been made. Wasserman-Schultz’s leadership has let down the party.
Since 2014, there have been serious claims asserting that she has exhibited an inappropriate level of favoritism toward the Clinton campaign. Many progressives cite that Wasserman-Schultz only scheduled six sanctioned debates leading up to the primaries (half of which were aired on Saturday nights and conflicted with NFL games) compared to 2008’s much larger 26 debates. There are claims that this confusing change was made in order to protect Clinton from the possibility of loss, and so that, even if she did lose, there wouldn’t be enough people watching to notice. These claims have been rejected by the DNC.
This decision also puts the entire Democratic party at a disadvantage when compared to the Republican debate schedule. Their debates are held during primetime spots on large networks. The Republican candidates have been getting more publicity, and not just because they say outrageous things, but because the DNC is simply not supporting its candidates.
Additionally, there is the misconduct surrounding Bernie Sanders’ staffers illegally accessing the Clinton campaign’s polling information. The DNC shut off the Sanders campaign’s access to the NGP VAN after a data breach in which the Sanders campaign’s data director accessed and possibly downloaded proprietary Clinton campaign polling files, which are private information. The Sanders campaign defends that this was not planned or sanctioned, but was due to a malfunction in NGP VAN’s systems. The campaign alerted the DNC to the security issue, and promptly fired the staffer. Yet before investigating these claims, the DNC’s response was to suspend Sanders’ access to the committee’s voter database. This affected his campaign to the tune of six figures in potential donations lost.
While the Sanders campaign is responsible for the conduct of its workers, Wasserman-Schultz and the DNC are also responsible for upholding the contract. According to Salon, the contract requires a written notice for suspension from the voter database, plus a 10-day grace period in order for the campaign to right its wrongs, which it did immediately. The suspension, without regard for this contract, unnecessarily deprived Sanders’ run for the Democratic ticket of millions in funds, giving Hillary an undeserved edge.
Even if these two allegations do not stand up under investigation, there is the simple fact that a large faction of the voter base does not trust her. Having lost this support, she cannot function as an effective leader and will never be able to unite the Democratic party.
 In an election year that means so much for the future of America, the DNC needs to stand together behind a set of common goals in order to protect the country from a right-wing reign of terror. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz is not the chairperson who can lead Democrats to a White House victory in 2016, and by standing her ground and fueling the flames of infighting, she is doing her party more harm than good.

The two flashpoints giving rise to the campaign against Debbie Wasserman Schultz around – the debate schedule and the flap with the Sanders campaign over the NGP VAN – are not sufficient to prove favoritism.
The debate schedule is lacking, but there are reasons besides locking down a Clinton nomination for the debate schedule to be sparse. Saying this shows favoritism for Clinton relies on the notion that debates would hurt Hillary Clinton’s campaign. That is unlikely. After most debates in 2008, she came out about the same as President Obama did, landing a few victories and a few losses. However, both Obama and Clinton are talented debaters. There was no reason to believe Senator (D-VT) Bernie Sanders or Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley would get the better of Clinton. That view has been mostly justified. Despite a small slip after the most recent debate, Clinton has mostly steamrolled her opponents in these debates, grabbing decisive victories according to live interview polling numbers (internet polls invite all sorts of biases, so their declaration that Sanders has won each debate is useless information). In fact, Sanders has been steadily gaining on Clinton, but stumbles after each debate comprise most of the gap between the two.
A lack of unsanctioned debates has shrunk the schedule, despite the number of sanctioned debates being about the same as in years past. Unsanctioned debates can become nightmares for the party participating. As campaigns heat up and get nasty, attacks get personal and harm candidates in the general more than they help candidates in the primary. Further, people have a talent to turn everything into a scandal, and nearly every debate in 2008 was followed by rumors of Clinton favoritism. Debates in the primary are a risk, but can be controlled when they are sanctioned. It’s likely Schultz was protecting the field here and not just her friend.
The second firestorm regarding the DNC’s reaction to the NGP VAN’s system breach was baffling. After unlawful activity by the Sanders campaign’s data director, the Sanders campaign managed to spin it into “the DNC is silencing us!” and got off without so much as a sweep to make sure the files were deleted. It’s easily possible that the staffer stole millions of dollars worth of polling numbers. If a tool is being used to break the law, the user loses access. It’s that simple. People go to jail over these kinds of situations. The fact that nothing happened doesn’t show Clinton favoritism, it shows that the DNC cares more about publicity than responsible enforcement of rules. This may be bad, but it’s not favoritism.
In the end, Schultz has presided over an era of endless frustration for liberal Democrats as they lose seats in Congress and watch their policy agenda be shredded by obstructionist Republicans. This may be Schultz’s fault (it probably isn’t, but that is a different debate entirely), but the witch hunt to declare her an undercover Clinton operative is simply not productive.

This letter was addressed to David Kosbie, instructor of 15-112, the introductory programming class at Carnegie Mellon. The letter poses questions about technology, social good, and whether the two actually correlate.
Dear Professor Kosbie,
You said in class that you were purposefully trying to hide your politics from us. Having just completed your class, I am kindly going to ask you questions that will require you to do otherwise. Not because I am curious, but because I am in desperate need of some perspective. 
I had no real programming experience prior to taking 112 this fall. I come from a culture where programming hasn’t become a “thing” yet, especially not at the high-school level. In fact, it is mostly associated with dull positions in the IT departments that existed since the 80’s. Therefore, I think you can recognize the culture shock I experienced coming to a place like Carnegie Mellon to study engineering. I was not sure at first I could fit in.
112 was definitely daunting at first, but I came to enjoy the rigor and creativity involved, and ended up doing fine. I was hoping that excelling at your class would make me feel as though I belong here, but it didn’t. I like to ask questions, and for some reason, that did not go well with being in an environment full of talented people whose sole purpose in life was to create technology. There were times when I felt depressed. But unlike most people at this institution, you seem to understand that technology is not intrinsically valuable, but worthwhile, as long as it promotes the interests of humankind.
You told us from the first day that you did not leave your high-paying corporate job to teach at Carnegie Mellon for your love of “for loops.” Throughout the semester, you tried to disillusion us about material pursuits, and encouraged us to program for social good. You did this in a packed schedule in which every minute counted. Your sincerity and optimism made me and many others stick with 112. I also do like for loops, however.
But the world is an ugly place, and I’m sure you would agree. Despite all of our economic and technological “progress,” extreme poverty exits, and is perhaps more widespread than ever. While asking us to volunteer for Stop Hunger Now, you yourself admitted that it is unacceptable that there can be hunger in a city like Pittsburgh. We are constantly being told that we have the power to change things, and it has some truth to it, if Carnegie Mellon students do not have the capacity to make a social impact through technology, I don’t know who else does. I have been here long, enough to realize, however, that most of us choose not to.
Big companies attract top talent, they always have. But let’s look at what the companies who frequently “farm” Carnegie Mellon grads are really doing. Facebook devises more efficient ways to get us to click on ads, Google cracks our search patterns to figure out what we might want to buy in the first place, Uber and Airbnb drive the existing service industry out of business by avoiding regulation. Not only that, but they actually drive people out of their homes, being on the forefront of the gentrification movement all across America. And these are not the worst ones, in fact, these are the ones frequently glorified for their attempts at social responsibility. But desirable urban space is rapidly becoming inaccessible to anyone without a six-figure salary. Entire cultures disappear. Class conflict is at an all-time high, surpassing that prior to the Great Depression. I’m really not sure how much philanthropy can compensate for that.
If any and all technology we create can somehow be used for socially detrimental purposes, how can we keep ourselves motivated? Can we really class ourselves responsible citizens when the traditional path to success as developers requires an indifference to what a society actually needs? Can we live with ourselves when we are so ready to blindly follow that path? How can we ever reconcile our love for solving puzzles and making a genuine social impact?
These are the thoughts plaguing my mind as I’m on the Pennsylvanian 43, about to start my second semester of college. Perhaps it is unfair of me to seek your guidance on such a topic, and I’m not sure if we are on the same page. But you seem to be my best shot, and I had to take it. Oh, and this train also happens to take 9 hours to reach Pittsburgh, and I don’t have much else to work on.
Best,
Alp
Although Professor Kosbie agreed that this is “the question,” and that we should be asking it in a rich variety of ways, he still believes that the letter captures only the “half-truth.” Technology is amoral in itself, and it can be used for good, just like it can be used for achieving horrendous deeds. Yet any attempt to block out technology will not make bad technology go away. The challenge is creating positive social impact, and then lies in finding the right puzzle to solve. He also added that the priorities of people change over time, tending to get less selfish as they begin to observe what is truly important in life.
