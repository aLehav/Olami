2019 Skate America was the first event in the 2019-20 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating. This was a competition in which athletes who performed well could earn points towards qualifying for the 2019-20 Grand Prix Final. Held in Las Vegas, Skate America saw seasoned competitors and first-timers alike vying for podium positions.
15-year-old Anna Shcherbakova, the Russian champion and Junior World silver medalist, was competing in her first senior-level Grand Prix event. Though she was among the youngest athletes in the competition, she had won gold at her senior debut at the Lombardia Trophy, and expectations ran high.
In the short program, Shcherbakova performed a double Axel, a triple flip, and a triple Lutz-triple loop combination for her jumps. However, under-rotation on the loop and a 1.00 point deduction for a fall, along with several mistakes on the step sequence meant that she received a total of 67.60 points. This placed her in fourth place, 7.5 points behind the leader, Bradie Tennell of the USA.
Shcherbakova’s free skate started spectacularly, beginning with a performance of her most difficult element: a quadruple Lutz-triple toe loop combination that seemed to have her levitating off the ice effortlessly. Landing beautifully, Shcherbakova quickly followed that up with a historic second quad Lutz that she landed just as cleanly. She then went on to perform 2 well-executed double Axels and a sequence of spins ending with a remarkable costume change, signaling the start of the second half of her routine with an accompanying shift in music.
A triple Lutz-triple loop combination was Shcherbakova’s first second-half element. Although the Lutz was done well, the loop was under-rotated. Another combination, a triple flip-Euler-triple Salchow, saw points withheld for under-rotation on the Salchow as well. Her last jump, a triple Lutz with both hands overhead, was wonderfully executed and given full points. Shcherbakova ended her routine with another set of spins, a well-choreographed step sequence, and a third set of spins, the sum of which brought her technical score up to 92.20 — nearly 20 points higher than the leading competitor.
With a program component score of 67.96, Shcherbakova received a phenomenal final free skate score of 160.16 — a score almost 10 points over her previous personal best and the second-highest ladies’ free skate score in history. She shot up to first place with a combined total of 227.76 points.
Bradie Tennell, who had led with a 75.10 personal best in the short program, put up a formidable performance, but her free skate score of 141.04 was far below Shcherbakova’s, and Tennell’s combined total of 216.14 saw her take the silver medal.
With her phenomenal performance, Shcherbakova took the gold medal in incredible style, becoming not only the first woman in the senior competition to land two quadruple Lutzes in international competition, but also the first lady to land a quad Lutz-triple combination in international competition. She also set new records for the highest valued single jump and highest valued jump combination, having earned 14.79 points for her quad Lutz and 18.66 points for her quad Lutz-triple toe combination.
Shcherbakova’s history-making quadruple Lutzes exemplifies the accelerating evolution of the sport. Scarcely two decades ago, the idea of a woman landing any quadruple jump in a competition of this scale seemed preposterous. The idea of anyone landing a quad Lutz, in fact, seemed incredible just a decade ago. Now with Shcherbakova landing two quad Lutzes a mere year after her countrywoman Alexandra Trusova landed the first ratified quadruple Lutz in competition, it is evident that figure skating is progressing rapidly towards new heights.
It seems that Shcherbakova is definitely a competitor to watch going forward, and if she continues to perform as well as she did at the ISU’s 2019 Skate America, more stunning, record-setting skates are sure to follow.

On Homecoming Saturday, clouds rolled into the sky as the Carnegie Mellon University football team faced off against the Thiel College Tomcats. In the first quarter, sophomore Brandon Nguyen opened the scoring with a 31-yard field goal making the game 3-0. With 13 minutes left in the first half, the Tartans had pushed the score to 17-0 with two touchdowns on short runs after long drives. 
The first came from a two-yard run from senior Chris Haas and the second came from a one-yard keeper by junior quarterback JD Dayhuff. By the end of the first half, the score was 30-0 thanks to a connection between Dayhuff and junior Alec Oshita on a 25-yard strike that pushed the score to 23-0. The duo linked up again for another 25-yard touchdown pass, leaving the scoreboard at 30-0 before the half. The game was assuredly in the Tartan's hands. 
Less than a minute into the third quarter, junior Luke Bikulege ran for a four-yard touchdown to push the score to 37-0, and with just four minutes left in the third quarter, junior placekicker Zack Shirk made the score 40-0 with his first career field goal. Thiel’s first run-in with the scoreboard came in the fourth quarter with a 10-yard touchdown pass to make the score 40-7. This victory made the Tartans 6-2 overall and the Tomcats 0-8 overall. The Tartans ended the game with the same electricity it began; the Tartans never slowed down and shut out the Tomcats for the majority of the game. 
Defensively, the Tartan secondary held Thiel to 182 yards of total offense. This is the third time this season that the Tartan defense has held the opposing team to less than 200 yards for an average of 273.9 yards allowed per game, but the defense is averaging only 12 points allowed per game. Senior Michael Lohmeier led the way in number of defensive tackles finishing with ten. The Tartans defense held off the Tomcats offense to two straight three-and-outs, giving the Tartans offense the opportunity to take advantage of each of their possessions and widen the score gap between the two teams. 
Offensively, Dayhuff threw for 225 yards, and Oshita was the top receiver for Dayhuff, garnering 88 yards through the air. Junior Sean Cooke led the rushing attack with 44 yards. 
In the end, the Tartans made this a memorable Homecoming by effectively boxing out the Tomcats for most of the game, capitalizing off of all of their possessions, and never losing energy and excitement throughout the game. The Tartans have a break next week, but will play host to the Titans of Westminster College on Nov. 9 at 1 p.m.

Last season, the Steelers just wanted to get to 2019. Running back Le'Veon Bell started the Steelers' season with drama by holding out for a bigger contract, and when he did not receive it, he didn't return to the team. This contributed to a losing streak that saw the Steelers go from a 7-2-1 start to finish at 9-6-1. Their record wasn't good enough to make the playoffs. To make matters worse, superstar wide receiver Antonio Brown had vocal, public disagreements with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, and eventually requested a trade to leave the Steelers.
A year later, the Steelers are free of the Brown and Bell drama, and it seemed they would not miss them much with their new star running back, James Conner, and a wide receiver core that still includes Pro Bowler Juju Smith-Schuster. The expectations were not high after a tough campaign in 2018, but the Steelers wanted to bounce back.
Six games in, the team is far from any playoff chance. After six games, they're well under .500 at 2-4.
The season started with a 33-3 shellacking at the hands of the New England Patriots. However, the Steelers can't carry too much blame for the loss. New England has continued on to a 7-0 record, and they have one of the best defenses in the NFL with 18 interceptions and an average of 4.0 yards allowed per play. Still, it was a troubling sign that the Steelers could not keep up with good competition.
The next game against the Seattle Seahawks was much more competitive, and the Steelers looked to build some momentum. However, Roethlisberger went down with an elbow injury, and the Steelers could not get the win with backup quarterback Mason Rudolph. Rudolph performed passably, but the Steelers lost 28-26. To make matters worse, Roethlisberger was ruled out for the season.
Roethlisberger's injury dealt a crushing blow to the Steelers. Rudolph performed well with a 67 percent completion rate and seven touchdowns to two interceptions, but he struggled in a Steelers loss against the San Francisco 49ers. Also, the injury bug struck the Steelers again when Rudolph left a game against the Baltimore Ravens with a concussion, and the team had to turn to third-string quarterback Devlin Hodges. Now, the Steelers are just 2-4 with their only victories against the winless Cincinnati Bengals and the struggling Los Angeles Chargers.
Now, the Steelers are hoping to recover from injuries and subpar play to make a playoff push before it is too late. This week, Rudolph and others like linebacker T.J. Watt will return from injury, and they hope to ease into things with a game on Monday against the 0-6 Miami Dolphins. At the least, the team's goal will certainly be to improve their play. Rudolph has performed serviceably, but his season high in attempts is 28 in today's pass happy NFL. This has put pressure on the running game, and it has sputtered with 3.5 yards per attempt despite having Conner, their star hopeful running back.
We won't know if the Steelers are back on the right track until they play better competition, but a win against the Dolphins would be a good start. If they want to turn their season around and return to the playoffs, they will have to start their push on Monday.

Baseball is best played in October. The air is cooler, the nights are darker, and under the bright lights, the play is better. So far, the 2019 Major League Baseball (MLB) postseason has been stellar, a mix of thrilling games, shocking upsets, fighting underdogs, and great lineups and rotations working together. As the American League champion Houston Astros and National League champion Washington Nationals are embroiled in the middle of a tight World Series, let’s look back at their paths to the Fall Classic.
With the best regular season record in baseball, the 107-win Astros entered the postseason as favorites to take back the championship for the second time in three years with a killer rotation that features Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander, who could both take the Cy Young, no questions asked. Most of their 2017 lineup has remained, with 2017 World Series MVP George Springer, 2017 NL MVP Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa, and Alex Bregman, who finished September with MVP-level stats.
But in the ALDS, the Astros had to get through the Tampa Bay Rays, who beat the Oakland Athletics in the Wild Card game and have the lowest payroll in baseball. The underdog Rays pushed the Astros to fives games in a best of five series, winning two elimination games before the Astros put it together to win Game 5 and head to the ALCS. Against the 103-win Yankees, the championship series for the AL pennant was a rematch of the 2017 ALCS, but this time it was clear the Astros were slightly better, winning in six games that featured two walk-offs, including Altuve’s series-winning home run.
The Astros met the Nationals in the World Series, a team that few expected to be in the conversation late in October. After losing franchise star Bryce Harper in free agency and a slow start to the season, the Nationals had little chance to even make it the postseason. But on the back of their two aces, Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg, and a high-contact lineup with Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto, the Nationals have defied expectations.
They defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in a come-from-behind win in the Wild Card and then pushed the heavy favorite Los Angeles Dodgers to five games in the NLDS. After two straight World Series appearances, a great regular season, and a stacked roster, the Dodgers were expected to cruise their way through the series. After trailing most of Game 5, the Nationals tied it up in the eighth, and then Howie Kendrick hit a grand slam in the 10th to advance the team to the NLCS. There, they cruised, sweeping the St. Louis Cardinals en route to the World Series.
The two teams have quite a few similarities. They have two aces, with a great third option: Zack Greinke for the Astros, who was traded mid-season, and Patrick Corbin for the Nationals, who was signed in free agency in the off season. They have stars, like Altuve and Soto, a second-year player who just turned 21 and has burst onto the national stage in the last few weeks.
And so they clashed, the road team winning in the first four games to even up the series at 2–2, effectively resetting for a two-of-three series. Maybe it will go all seven games, like the best World Series do. Perhaps the Astros will assert their dominance like all the pundits expected, or the Nationals will continue on this great run they’ve had. Let’s grab our friends, bundle up in our late fall jackets, grab a foot-long hot dog, and watch the last baseball games of the year.

This is Penalty Shouts, The Tartan’s sports column inspired by the The New Yorker’s column Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled column will focus on anything and everything funny in the sports world that is deserving of our comedic attention.
There is a new soccer God, and his name is Christian Pulisic. Has Messi ever scored a hat trick against Burnley? Has Pulisic ever evaded his taxes? Has Ronaldo ever been cool? No. No. And no. 
As someone who has played, in my own Pennsylvania childhood, against a team that Pulisic would have scrimmaged against regularly in his time on the PA Classics Academy team, I have the definitive facts that prove Pulisic is, like, really good at soccer. And those facts will prove that I am simply a fallen God of the soccer world, my talents instead wasted on dumb teenagers that I played pickup against last week. Or at least I think they were teenagers. They could have been toddlers. Basically the same thing. I digress.
When I was a young buck, my soccer skills were quite unmatched. I was a goalie for my team, diving this way and that to prevent the other team from scoring. In one game, I only let in eight goals. My worst moment was only a single occurrence — better than most — and it was only because I had to go to the bathroom. So I faked an injury. But that only says my on-field prowess was unmatched by everyone we ever played.
Now the day I played against the team Pulisic would have played against in practice, I was really on my game. At one point, I made a scorpion kick save. This one kid was really good, however, likely a nice matchup against Pulisic in any number of practice drills and games. During the game, he got a few shots on net early in the game, but my goalie fu left him scoreless. Although my best save of the game came in the last few minutes. This top player was on a breakaway. He ran at me with ferocity. He made it all the way to me. He wound up for a shot. I punched him in the face. He didn’t score! 
After that, I went off the field because the dumb referee called it a “foul,” but I didn’t see any dirty play. The kid kinda deserved it. And I even apologized once his nose stopped bleeding, but the referee didn’t see eye to eye with me. Anyway, we lost the game 16–1. 
It’s safe to say that I took that kid to task, and since he (likely) played against Christian Pulisic in practice, I am almost as good as our new American soccer God. Whenever I start playing again, I’ll surely be offered a spot at Tottenham, at least. That’s when I’ll show the world my true skills.
Until then, Godspeed Pulisic. May America have mercy on your soul.

While we have long known that neural activity in the brain is responsible for disorders such as dementia and epilepsy, recent research conducted by scientists in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School (HMS) has shown that it also plays a role in human aging and life span.
The study was published in Nature on Oct. 16. Researchers observed mice, worms, and human brains and found that a lot of activity in the brain is correlated with shorter life spans. As such, suppressing brain activity extends life spans. This is the first piece of evidence that supports the hypothesis that nervous system activity impacts longevity in humans. Past studies have demonstrated that portions of the nervous system affect animal aging, but no prior work has shown similar effects in humans.
“An intriguing aspect of our findings is that something as transient as the activity state of neural circuits could have such far-ranging consequences for physiology and life span,” said study senior author Bruce Yankner, professor of genetics at HMS and co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biology of Aging in a HMS press release.
A chain that affects longevity, the insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway, is apparently where neural excitation acts. An integral portion of this signaling cascade is RE1-Silencing Transcription (REST), a protein that the Yankner Lab has shown prevents brains from developing dementia and other disorders.
Neural activity is defined as all of the electrical currents and transmissions contained within the brain. Neural excitation can result in many outcomes such as a muscle twitch or a change in our mood. As for mood, the study has not yet shown if someone’s thoughts, personality, or actions change their lifespan.
“An exciting future area of research will be to determine how these findings relate to such higher-order human brain functions,” said Yankner.
Yankner and his colleagues looked at gene expression patterns in donated tissue from people who died between the ages of 60 and 100. None of these adults had dementia.
They found that those who were alive for more than 85 years expressed neural excitation genes to a lesser extent than those who died between the ages of 60 and 80. In order to test if these results were due to correlation or causation, the researchers conducted many experiments on C. elegans, genetically altered mice, and more brain tissue.
They found that blocking REST, a protein responsible for suppressing gene expression and neural activity, caused higher neural activity and earlier deaths. Centenarians’ brains contained more REST than those who died earlier.
Thanks to this study, the development of new therapies that can treat conditions involving neural excitation such as Alzheimer’s disease or bipolar disorder is imminent. In addition, the scientists have found that some forms of medicine like drugs that target REST or some actions such as meditation may be capable of increasing lifespan through the modulation of neural activity. Since human variation in neural activity may have both environmental and genetic causes, this study has opened up future avenues for therapeutic intervention.

According to a study from Tel Aviv University and researchers from Spain, early Paleolithic people stored animal bones for weeks and then feasted on them, according to archeological findings in Qesem Cave in Israel. The Lower Paleolithic time period that occurred 400,000 years ago has had much of its history discovered at the cave.
“Bone marrow constitutes a significant source of nutrition and as such was long featured in the prehistoric diet,” explained Professor Ran Barkai of Tel Aviv University in a press release. “Until now, evidence has pointed to immediate consumption of marrow following the procurement and removal of soft tissues. In our paper, we present evidence of storage and delayed consumption of bone marrow at Qesem Cave.”
The study reveals how early humans adapted and interacted with each other to survive. The residents of the Qesem Cave usually brought some parts of animal carcasses, including limbs and skulls of fallow deer.
“We found that the deer leg bones, specifically the metapodials, exhibited unique chopping marks on the shafts, which are not characteristic of the marks left from stripping fresh skin to fracture the bone and extract the marrow,” said Professor Jordi Rosell of Rovira i Virgili University in Reus, Spain.
The bones were covered in skin in order to preserve marrow. Indeed, experimentation by the researchers determined that marrow fat was only minimally degraded after up to nine weeks of storage in the cave.
“We discovered that preserving the bone along with the skin, for a period that could last for many weeks, enabled early humans to break the bone when necessary and eat the still nutritious bone marrow,” added Tel Aviv University’s Professor Ruth Blasco, lead author on the study.
Essentially, the bones were vessels for the marrow that was so critical in these Paleolithic humans’ diets. When the people of the Qesem Cave wanted to eat, they simply peeled back the protective skin and shattered the bone. This pattern of food storage represents a major advancement in hunter-gatherer behavior and a step towards growing human intellect.

Clean energy is a hot topic in today’s scientific community, with researchers all over the world dedicating herculean amounts of time and effort towards finding innovative and sustainable solutions to fueling future generations. Although the term “clean energy” prompts many people to think about wind turbines, solar panels, and hydroelectric plants, researchers at the University of Cambridge, led by Professor Erwin Reisner, took a unique approach by mimicking the photosynthetic machinery of ordinary leaves to produce syngas, a widely used gas in commercial products that’s currently produced from fossil fuels.
Much like ordinary leaves, these artificial leaves take in sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water, the staples of photosynthesis. While one portion of the artificial leaf outputs oxygen like an ordinary leaf, the other portion focuses on reducing carbon dioxide and water into carbon monoxide and hydrogen, forming the syngas mixture, forming the syngas mixture. As a pleasant surprise, the researchers found that their combinations of catalysts and sensors also operates efficiently under low-light conditions, meaning that the artificial leaf performs effectively under low-light and cloudy conditions, a step above ordinary solar panels.
“This means you are not limited to using this technology just in warm countries, or only operating the process during the summer months,” said PhD student Virgil Andrei, first author of the paper, in a Cambridge press release. “You could use it from dawn until dusk, anywhere in the world.”
While the creation of the artificial leaf itself is a breakthrough, Reisner and his team are already looking at ways to improve the device to start generating liquid fuels since syngas is a component for the synthesis of liquid fuels. What the team hopes to accomplish is to produce liquid fuels in a one-step process rather than making syngas first and then converting the gas into fuel. With such an advancement, fuel generated from the artificial leaves could be used as a sustainable and carbon-neutral alternative to petrol and fossil fuels.
Whether or not such efforts will yield success remains to be seen, but the team is confident that their choice of components, as well as their current results, indicates that they’re moving in the right direction. As the global demand for liquid fuels continues to escalate, the commercial introduction of the artificial leaf could help move us towards a more sustainable and energy-rich future. Changing means of energy production is good for the environment.

The Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens has managed to reinvent itself from a beautiful area dedicated to the cultivation and preservation of a wide array of plants to a space that could be enjoyed and celebrated by children of all ages. Many of their different gardens have become places for children to play. In one room, a children’s train set was inserted into the shrubbery and the tracks were laid into the soil. Small lifelike figures of people stood between the leaves, tiny windmills spun in the breeze, and houses and farms decorated the spaces uninhabited by plants.
Upon entrance to the Conservatory, a staff member points out the path of the activities. First, though, goodie bags filled with candies and small games are offered. In a winding way, the participant, child or adult, floats from room to room in a sparkling wonder. Surprisingly, the only thing out of place was the wedding rehearsal happening in a large space in the southwest corner of the gardens, seeming to remind all of the adults and even some of the children that the experience that they were having in the conservatory was a once a year event and that they should enjoy it while it lasted.
On the other side of the wedding rehearsal, a game was well underway with a dozen children lining up to try and toss a ring onto a witch’s hat on the ground. Magnificent as the rehearsal was, it was clear that the event would not squelch the capacity for fun on the evening. Children’s enjoyment was to be had in every room possible at every possible second, even during a wedding rehearsal, making the evening magical for the children that were there.
Outside, across a small, beautiful bridge, and back inside again, the line for face painting stretched on and on. Peering to see the work of the artist, one could find the faces of children masquerading as unicorns, green goblins, butterflies, and fairies. Walking past the line, the room with multiple train sets was the next spectacle. Children bent around the tracks trying to peer inside of the tiny, moving trains. Some even ran alongside the train, too impatient to wait to see it a mere minute later when it came back.
The last spectacle to complete the circle was a pot your own plant station. Somehow we had gone from goodie bags to ring tosses to unicorns to trains and back to plants, the main attraction of the gardens. Perhaps the last station was a reminder that families could take home with them a reminder of what the gardens had promised these children for one night only: magic, in whatever form they could find it.

Everyone dreams of being the hero of their own story, and Frank Abagnale Jr. is no exception. Like many, he dreamed of a fascinating life, but lived his life like no other.
Based on the autobiography and the 2002 film of the same name, Catch Me If You Can recounts the tale of former criminal Frank William Abagnale Jr. and his teenage heists: impersonating a pilot, doctor, and lawyer all while making a fortune. Scotch’n’Soda’s production certainly makes its mark bringing Catch Me If You Can to the stage, serving this musical with a rather bitter introduction and a sweet aftertaste, all with its twists and rocks.
Frank Abagnale Jr. (Clayton Edwards), is first introduced to the audience as a 16-year old, caught in the middle of his parents’ infidelity and subsequent divorce. The character himself is an acquired taste for the audience. Almost like a Sour Patch-Kid, Frank comes off as a little sour at first, almost unlikable, whiny, and stubborn. Even when he’s impersonating a pilot, Frank seems a bit too outwardly naive: in real life, Frank’s apparent lack of confidence while pulling off his stunt as a pilot would probably get him caught right away. It wasn’t until his first attempt to charm his way out of being arrested that the audience finally got a glimpse of the hidden genius behind Frank Abagnale Jr. The sweet charisma, chutzpah, and brilliance that gave Frank the ability to scheme his way was finally revealed. For me, that was the turn-around point when I started laughing with him instead of at him.
From then on, until the 11 o’clock number “Goodbye,” I found myself rooting for Frank despite the gravity of his crimes. The emerging maturity of the character and his emotional development contributed to a far more enjoyable presence throughout the second act, as well as during the finale.
Carl Hanratty (Quincy Eaton), the seemingly antagonistic FBI agent bent on catching Frank, was the metaphorical Cadbury Cream Egg: tough on the outside while emotional on the inside. Slightly more comic than truly intimidating, Hanratty’s supposedly hidden ‘flamboyance’ added to the giggles scattered throughout the audience. His signature number complemented by Eaton’s superb dancing skills (appropriately titled “Don’t Break the Rules”) was certainly one to remember. Honestly, I don’t think I’ll ever get the image of Hanratty channeling his inner Fred Astaire out of my head any time soon. In short though, his character is quite stagnant throughout the show, almost absent of development, but nevertheless manages to leave a pleasant impression.
Though Catch Me If You Can is a story of Frank’s escapades and Hanratty’s chase, the supporting characters certainly make their mark long after the show. Some notable figures include Brenda Strong (Zoe Lehn), the eventual love interest of Frank, who successfully subverts the all-too-familiar Mary Sue trope while playing the grounded foil to Frank’s chaos. Lehn’s strong (no pun intended) vocal range and acting abilities made her character likable and turned her performance of “Fly, Fly Away” from a simple ballad to a vocal, tear-jerking showpiece. Meanwhile, the FBI agents Branton, Cod, and Dollar (Grant Martin, Olivia Snavely, and Nathan Blinn, respectively) provided the largest source of comic relief throughout the show. Starting off as barely laughable through their mutual ‘hazing’ antics, they ‘bring the big guns’ (still no pun intended) through the second half delivering laugh-out-loud, slapstick-like comedy gold as they accompany Hanratty on his crime-fighting quest.
While I highly appreciate the efforts made by the lighting crew to use a colorful variety to represent various physical and emotional turning points in the plot, I personally found the set itself to be rather empty. For a musical (and a protagonist) that seeks a life “in living color,” “la dolce vita,” and “butter ‘outta cream,” I was expecting a bit more embellishment. The minimalist set, while not unfamiliar, seemed unsuitable for Catch Me If You Can, given its plot about Frank living the stylish, glamorous, and fast-paced life.
As highly anticipated as they were, the musical numbers certainly did not disappoint. The orchestra, despite the surprisingly small size, delivered a powerful sound that carried energy and musicality. (However, the proximity of the not-really-in-the-pit orchestra made the actors slightly difficult to hear throughout the show.) My personal favorite, “Live in Living Color”, literally set the stage in the best energetic and colorful way possible. “Butter ‘Outta Cream” and “Little Boy Be a Man” served as jazzy songs describing the two contrasting types of father-son relationships. The former, performed by Frank and his father, and reprised with Frank and Hanratty, hints at a friendly relationship, almost confidant-like, and serves as an homage to the American dream. Meanwhile, the latter describes an authoritarian style of parenting, as well as a source of bonding (and good chemistry) between Hanratty and Frank’s father. And I’m sure that I will hear the romantic and sweet “Seven Wonders” at weddings, anniversaries, and proposals for years to come. Last but not least, “Goodbye” had me in awe of Edwards’ tenor and acting ability as he portrayed a changed, slightly saccharine, Frank Abagnale Jr., ready to leave a life of crime. It was truly the best farewell I have ever heard.
All in all, a job well done by Scotch’n’Soda Theatre for delivering a feel-good performance with memorable numbers and characters.
Now excuse me as I make “Live in Living Color” my phone alarm.

It feels like my past several Pillbox articles have been concert reviews. In these past few weeks, I’ve been to more concerts than I have been in my entire life combined, but I’m not complaining! Last Thursday, Oct. 17, Hoodie Allen performed at Foxtail as part of his Whatever USA tour. After being a longtime fan, and being unable to go to his two previous shows, I finally got to see him. I guess third time really is a charm!
I’m not new to smaller venues, but this bar set was a first. The bar was absolutely packed with other fangirls chanting along to every word to every song, as well as to Lizzo’s “Truth Hurts” during the intermission. It might seem a bit “basic,” but what fun is life if you don’t let yourself enjoy things?
Rapper Jake Miller opened. Sometimes opening acts don’t get the hype that they deserve, but that was not the case with Jake’s performance. I’m personally not too familiar with his music and arrived halfway through his set, but I could still feel the high momentum and energy that matched that during Hoodie’s performance.
Hoodie kicked off the show with the title track of his latest release, Whatever USA. I was partially expecting his tour to focus on his newer tracks, but he had a nice mix of older and newer tracks. He went back to Crew Cuts with OG favorites like “Two Lips” and “Cake Boy,” letting me live my best junior high life (back in the day when I listened to those on my iPod). Tracks from People Keep Talking and Happy Camper threw me back and made me almost believe that my high school years were my glory years (thankfully, they were not). The Hype, and now Whatever USA, captured the brighter parts of my college experience.
Should I have outgrown boyish music idols by now? Maybe. Perhaps one day I will. But for now, I enjoyed the performance. In the words of Hoodie himself, “I wanna stay young; don’t wanna fit in, I wanna have fun; so if that’s okay, I don’t think I’m ever gonna act my age.”

“Wokeness” is dumb.
Now before I get attacked for that, hear me out really quickly. I am not referring to actually being socially conscious. I don’t think anyone thinks that being more socially conscious is bad, unless you’re a self-proclaimed “anti-SJW” like Ben Shapiro or Jordan Peterson. When I say “woke,” I refer to companies who try to be socially conscious for the sake of trendiness and being hip. It’s become a term drenched in irony, more often than not used as a joke or a criticism because of how much of a parody it has become.
There is a lot that can be said about “woke culture” in particular, but I’m going to specifically focus on pop culture. I think “wokeness” in our pop culture has been ruined by “cultural analysts” in the media who like to write filler, and corporations exploiting it for profit.
Part 1: The Media
For the first point, let’s look at the Joker controversy, which has been done to death, but represents everything wrong with how the media tries to be “woke.” For “cultural analysts” in the media, the “woke” goal was to be ahead of the curve. If you spoke out about the movie being dangerous before seeing it, reviewed the movie and happened to like it, and then the shooting happened, at least you can point to the first thing you said and be like “see, I was right all along and I’m really woke.”
Here are the problems with this whole ordeal. First, movies don’t cause violence. They haven’t ever been correlated. Second, the hysteria caused by this will only increase the likelihood of a shooting, not the opposite. Many “cultural analysts” thought the new Joker movie would inspire another shooter akin to the one in Aurora, CO from 2012, who claimed he was inspired by the Joker. Except he wasn’t. That was a rumor that got erroneously circulated. A simple Google search could have cleared that, but that didn’t stop these “cultural analysts” from going ballistic.
The movie was also called an incel movie repeatedly, which none of the trailers indicated. The movie itself didn’t turn out to be one. If anything, the main point many of these “analysts” jumped to is that a story about a white guy going insane is an incel movie, which isn’t “woke” at all. It’s just wrong and they seem to completely not know what “being an incel” means. What even is an incel movie? Incels will view any awful, sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, and/or violent white character in any piece of media as a hero, especially when that piece of media portrays said character in a negative light. That’s what incels do. It’s the same way racists liked Borat and homophobes liked Brüno without getting the fact that they were being made fun of. Don’t give incels the negative attention they crave with this unwarranted “woke” crusade.
If you really wanted an actual cultural critique of the movie, talk about how the movie correlates mental illness with violence. That discussion has been severely overlooked, and the film’s lack of nuance regarding that subject was grating. A film creating empathy for the main character who is an awful person doesn’t mean you’re glorifying that character. Saying that it does for the sake of being “woke” is dishonesty and bad criticism, especially when you’re cherry-picking which movies to have that point applied to.
Part 2: Corporations
No one should be surprised by corporations ruining “wokeness.” Let’s look at Disney, a company I would love to see get dismantled piece by piece. We all know their remakes are bad, but the more I thought about it, the more I was bothered by the way they try to be “woke.”
After torrenting the remake, I rewatched the original Dumbo, and I swear to god there is a scene with a pack of crows led by a crow named Jim Crow who sounds like a caricature of a black person that a racist white person would imitate. The remake doesn’t even acknowledge that, cutting out the crow characters entirely. Now that doesn’t seem bad until you realize they have an entire anti-animal cruelty message running throughout the whole movie to “correct” the mistake of the original. In the original, Dumbo gets drunk and hallucinates, but in the remake they “correct” that by keeping the alcohol away from the baby elephant when someone offers it.
This is a microcosm of what’s wrong with these movie studios trying to be “woke”: it’s “woke” for the sake of profit. It seems obvious, but it’s really insidious and people eat it up. Animal cruelty and women’s empowerment are things that can be marketed. But Disney’s racist history? That’s not marketable. Just erase it entirely and pretend it doesn’t exist. It works. Aladdin and The Lion King made tons of money. Both featured scenes of all the female characters being “extra empowered,” such as Jasmine getting an extra song talking about how she won’t be silenced in Aladdin (which wasn’t a problem in the original anyway) and with Nala getting a fight scene in The Lion King because Disney really wants to show how strong she is. But neither addresses the racist material in both movies, and both movies diminish the female characters by making them one-dimensional in the remakes.
The industry just seems to be content with ignoring its racist history, and will claim it’s solved racism, sexism, and all the other -isms by marketing how it’s becoming more “representative.” Writing one-dimensional female characters who are physically strong is totally good representation. Who cares about writing good female characters? Doesn’t matter. The industry says they respect women, even though they pay them less on average and are hesitant to hire female directors and writers. Recasting previously white characters as different races is such good representation. Who cares about writing good characters for non-white actors to play? Doesn’t matter. So many “woke” people will eat up this garbage, pandering nonsense from the industry, but it’s just corporate robots selling them a PR vision.
Ok so you criticized everything. What’s the point?
At this point, I just find people claiming “wokeness” to be disingenuous. This isn’t me acting all high and mighty, nor am I calling people bad for being disingenuous. Their intentions are in the right place. But I haven’t heard a single socially conscious person refer to themselves as “woke” without being ironic. I think many people can do better to be more conscious, and it’s not hard to do better.

The Lighthouse is not a “strange” movie (David Sims, The Atlantic) nor is it “savage” and “beyond belief” (Anthony Lane, The New Yorker), and really, it’s not even that horrifying. The Lighthouse is, however, a kind of Romantic sea-tale set somewhere among the literary tradition of Austen, Coleridge, and Melville, while taking contemporary cues from the likes of The Evil Dead and the genre of horror. But from the outset, you are not placed into the traditional horror. This world is different, more visceral and more realistic.
In the opening moments of Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) and Thomas Wake’s (Willem Dafoe) time on the island, they stare straight out at the camera as if aware they are being photographed. Yet, we get each of their most intimate moments. Both Winslow and Wake have moments of unbridled sexuality depicted on screen, from images of sexual fantasies and not-so-dreamlike moments of masturbation to subtle spoken moments of homoeroticism that turn into aggressive displays of masculinity. Always being watched, like Winslow and Wake are, creates an anxiety around some of their more intimate moments, but sometimes, you really don’t care who sees what. People do some really disgusting things on camera after all, like masturbate to a mermaid figurine.
Before continuing with Winslow and Wake, it would probably help to explain why this movie isn’t horror, even though the generic conventions are present. There’s a pervasive sound of a bullhorn from beginning to end, but rather than the normal anxiety-inducing sound effect, it’s just an annoyance. It’s not exactly striking fear into anybody’s hearts. There’s the fog, the desolation, and isolated setting where they are trapped by a storm of epic proportions that sets up Winslow for a psychotic, murderous rage, but none of those things make for a particularly psychotic or murderous rage. It’s the dull, mundane rage built up by a moralizing and importunate superior that drives Winslow crazy, and that is where the story is made.
Winslow, our representative of our fallen world, is driven insane by his bewhiskered superior with an injured leg and tendency to sound like Captain Ahab, and the comparison is driven home by Wake’s fanatic protection of the idyllic world, the light at the top of the eponymous lighthouse. It becomes so obvious, Winslow has no choice but to call out Wake by saying he’s tired of Wake’s Ahab shtick, labeling him a “goddamn parody.” Some reviews have called The Lighthouse a two-hander (two main characters), but Winslow is the hero of the story, as he is given the Promethean task of defeating Wake, ascending the lighthouse, reaching into the light, and returning to the fallen world alive. But those tasks are only one conflict of Winslow’s in the movie. The other conflict revolves around Winslow’s sanity, and his fight against the darker forces of humanity.
As the movie progresses, Winslow’s sanity is questioned more and more as he faces a descent into the dark parts of humanity. Ultimately, the conflict between Winslow and the dark supernatural forces of the movie are comparable to “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” but instead of an albatross shot down from the sky to change the winds of fortune, The Lighthouse uses a seagull that, for the first half of the movie, provides a comically stubborn antagonist. The scene where Winslow ends the bird’s life is not particularly gory or gross or terrifying, but the winds change, the storm blows in, and the two men are forced into conflict. Before the murder of the seagull, there is a chance for Winslow to escape the island. Winslow must descend into Hades and face the dark forces within his psyche to actualize his ascent to the top of the lighthouse, destroying the fervent and evangelical protector of the light on the way.
Beside all of that, The Lighthouse is a two-hour romp of a story, with righteous comedic timing, sublime performances from Pattinson and Dafoe, and aesthetically enjoyable photography with appropriate referentiality to painting and photography of the era. Go see it. It’s cool and fun and shows up every A24 movie about dumb things like family.

“The greatest thing you’ll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.”
This was one of the iconic lines of the 2001 romantic drama film, Moulin Rouge! — a film recently adapted into a stage musical, currently playing in Broadway’s Al Hirschfeld Theatre.
Recently, I spent a weekend in New York City, and had the privilege of seeing Moulin Rouge! The Musical, and it was an experience to remember.
Upon entering the theatre, I was caught off guard by the sheer bold grandeur of the set. The entire house was bathed in red light. The stage itself was lined with cabaret lights, and the words “Moulin Rouge” hung in the middle of the stage in giant neon letters. The elephant stood above stage right, and the windmill spun slowly above stage left. In the center, the stage extended out to a can-can table, with two alcoves cut out for exclusive seating.
The Al Hirschfeld Theatre is a relatively small, intimate theatre, and standing in spot 13, I could see nearly everything — the overhang of the mezzanine just barely blocking the windmill and part of the elephant. A shift in lighting signaled the start of the show, and for the next 2.5 hours, the audience was plunged into a tale of artful desire and fateful fortune.
Throughout this experience, actors used the aisles liberally, frequently entering and exiting from the leftmost and rightmost aisles, so that standing where I was, the actors that passed were often less than five feet away, something which made the experience feel closer and more immersive.
Aaron Tveit and Karen Olivo did a phenomenal job of bringing their characters to life. Tveit perfectly balanced Christian’s optimistic charisma and stubborn confidence in happy endings, walking the line between naive love and passionate madness. Olivo splendidly portrayed Satine’s persevering, but weathered protectiveness and resigned, but enduring strength, exuding that sense of sybaritic mystique and sensitive confidence.
The entire company did well to bring out the dynamic interplay between personalities and classes, emphasizing the larger-than-life feeling the show inhabits.
Staying true to its status as a jukebox musical, Moulin Rouge! retains some of the songs used in the film soundtrack from artists such as Madonna, Nat King Cole, and Elton John, while expanding its listing — more than doubling it, in fact — to include music from the likes of REO Speedwagon and the Rolling Stones, alongside contemporary pop icons such as Katy Perry, Adele, and Beyoncé.
The integration of songs from different genres and eras was considerably well-done, and the choice of music often played into the fun, comedic enthusiasm of the show. The energy from the music did seem to be slightly excessive at times, especially during the more serious scenes, in that the tempo of the music was sometimes distinct from the graveness it was meant to portray. However, the exaggeration still worked in the context of the overall superfluousness the play itself intends to embody. Overall, the song choices and their incorporation into the musical could certainly be considered unorthodox, but in a way that I feel exhibits creativity and artistic wit.
On the more technical side of things, the show’s lighting and costume design were both extremely well-done. The mix between the cabaret-style lights, strobe lights, neon lights, and LEDs implemented by lighting designer Justin Townsend was instrumental in moving the story. The distinction between the bold vivid palette used for the Moulin Rouge performers versus the muted colors of the Bohemian artists and the pastel of the aristocracy, all courtesy of costume designer Catherine Zuber, emphasized the lifestyle and symbolic differences in the characters.
At its core, Moulin Rouge! was the epitome of spectacle. It intentionally played into the absurdity of extravagance, and did so in spectacular style. The contrast between the outward lavish brilliance of the show and the underlying tragedy it narrates made it all the more compelling, and the blend of ecstasy and despair along with fervent infatuation and desperate belief made it a truly remarkable masterpiece.

This review contains minor spoilers.
If you’re looking for a fun night in with a so-bad-it’s-kinda-good (but not really) movie, look no further than one of Netflix’s newest releases, Tall Girl. Take a rom-com plot, notably along the lines of the John Hughes classic Pretty in Pink, and make it modern and cinematically worse. Honestly, I’m doing a disservice to Hughes by comparing this movie to anything in his filmography, but the plots are way too similar: outcast girl falls for attractive, popular guy and makes a fool out of herself after her best friend who secretly (Pretty in Pink), or not-so-secretly (Tall Girl), has a crush on her and unsuccessfully dissuades her from attempting to get the guy. The outcomes are different, but the main plot is essentially the same. Hughes just, as expected, does it way better.
In Tall Girl, Jodi is tormented by her classmates at her high school for being 6’1”, but the support of her friends, Fareeda and Dunkleman, has gotten her through it while she keeps her head down and tries not to draw attention to herself. I don’t know about other people’s high schools, but it just seemed petty and unrealistic for people to be that obnoxious to her for something so silly. Also, it statistically seemed strange how not a single human was taller than Jodi in the whole school? But okay, sure. Whatever.
Despite having two incredible friends, she longs to be a girl that guys want to date. Dunkleman constantly expresses his interest in her, and yet she can’t see past the fact that he is considerably shorter than her and continues to not take him seriously. He tells her that her expectations are too high for a perfect boyfriend, yet she still daydreams about it. As luck (or cringe-worthy screenwriting) would have it, the new, tall Swedish exchange student, Stig, just happens to waltz into chemistry class during this discussion and instantly make all the girls swoon for him, including Jodi. To make the love triangle even more dramatic, Stig is living with Dunkleman while he’s in the States. Actually, it’s a love square: Kimmy, the most popular girl in school (who happens to be Jodi’s worst tormenter), immediately digs her manicured claws into Stig and claims him as hers. All I have to say is yikes.
Tension rises as Jodi stumbles across Stig playing the piano, joins him in a duet (with singing from Guys and Dolls and everything), and is caught by Kimmy, who warns Jodi to stay away from Stig when he’s not listening. Of course, Stig is a friendly guy who is oblivious and still tries to hang out with Jodi, and more havoc ensues throughout the rest of the movie, resulting in Jodi losing her friends and lots of other drama.
Everything in this movie was absolutely ridiculous, which made it fun to watch with friends and laugh about how awkward and uncomfortable it was. However, it was not remotely a well-made movie. The character development was nonexistent, their motivations made no sense, their decisions seemed impromptu and out-of-character based on the little knowledge of each person we did have, and there was barely any natural plot progression. It seemed very forced.
Also, Jodi was just not the most likable character. Maybe it’s because everyone else’s expectations of her were so unrealistic, but she continuously made questionable and irresponsible choices and couldn’t handle it when she had to face the repercussions. She wasn’t evil, but she definitely was inconsiderate of those who genuinely cared about her. Considering all the horrible things she had to deal with socially, she seemed rather gullible and susceptible to being swayed by the popular crowd after her sister and mom gave her a makeover, which in reality seemed to be a simple swap from sweatpants to jeans and the ditching of her daily ponytail.
The only positives throughout the whole movie were her best friends and her family. There were definitely rough patches in Jodi’s relationship with Dunkleman and Fareeda, but Dunkleman’s devotion to Jodi and Fareeda’s willingness to fight anyone to keep Jodi safe was really sweet. Although her family could be really awkward and often did all the wrong things to make her feel better, they genuinely cared about Jodi’s well-being. Her sister was a bit strange since she was a pageant queen (to act as a contrast to Jodi’s supposed awkwardness), but she was a genuinely nice person who tried to help her sister out in her time of need, and the moments Jodi shares with her dad were some of the most heartwarming and believable moments in the whole movie.
In the end, I wasn’t disappointed by Tall Girl, but I also didn’t come in with high expectations. It was probably as good and as bad as I could have expected. It’s worth a watch just to make fun of it.

Pittsburgh sits on the Marcellus Shale, one of the largest deposits of natural gas in the United States. This past Wednesday, President Trump delivered the keynote address at Shale Insight, a conference hosted by the Marcellus Shale Coalition, the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, and the West Virginia Oil and Natural Gas Association. 
This marks his second visit to the region in the past months, after his Aug. rally at the Shell cracker plant in Beaver County.
The Shale Insights conference was attended largely by those working in natural gas. In his remarks, Trump emphasized his support for the industry, citing the rollback of environmental regulations and withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords. 
The keynote address was open to the public, with a section cordoned off to create space for a rally in the back, and Trump addressed some of the activating issues for his supporters, including re-upping his claim that he is working for “Pittsburgh, not Paris.”
Indigenous activists and anti-fracking groups gathered at Point State Park and held a water ceremony in the Ohio River before marching into downtown for a second Defend the Water rally in protest of the conference. The rally was intended to “address the destructive impacts of the petrochemical industry build-out in the Ohio River Valley and beyond on people and the environment,” according to the website of Breath Project, one of the rally’s co-organizers.
The protests expanded beyond an opposition to fracking, many focusing on Trump himself. 14 protesters, holding a sign that read “Our solidarity will defeat white nationalism,” were arrested for blocking a ramp from the Fort Pitt Bridge near the convention center where the conference was being held.
Mina Karimi, a Carnegie Mellon doctoral student in Civil and Environmental Engineering, “didn’t see any” protests as she presented her research around modeling extraction-related earthquakes at the conference’s research showcase. To Karimi, the conference was an opportunity to talk to people in the industry about projects in natural gas extraction.
Karimi said that her experience of the conference was “not that different” from past events since keynote speakers are mostly presidents and vice presidents of shale and gas companies who also are important decision-makers in the oil and gas industry.
The protests did reach inside the conference. Eight protesters from the progressive Jewish activist group, Bend the Arc, began a chant of “Trump endangers Jews” during the keynote address, and were subsequently removed. The conference was just a couple days shy of the one year anniversary of the Tree of Life shooting, something the protesters referenced in a statement on the organization’s website.
“Don’t hurt him, please. They don’t know they’re dealing with very tough people in this room,” responded Trump.
Isabella Mahal, a first-year political science major at the University of Pittsburgh, attended the rally with the intent of causing some sort of disruption. She and her friend, fellow Pitt student Keri-Anne Laing, had been Googling chants on their phone when they heard the Bend the Arc group and decided to join in.
Mahal’s interactions with Trump supporters in the first part of the rally had been mostly apolitical. She likened them to conversations she may have had with neighbors back home in Colorado. Once she joined the protest, however, she said watched some of the same “faces who I had been seeing, they were smiling at us, dancing,” yelling and jeering at them and the other protesters.
“It was definitely [a] moment of real fear about if in fact, I did not know what I had walked into. And I think that that hit me in that moment. The thought that immediately followed that was, this is what people my age, this is what people younger than me live with every day,” when they are unable to pretend, because of their race or gender presentation, that they might fit in at a Trump rally, said Mahal. Since she could pass as a straight, white Republican, Mahal said that this experience reinforced her belief that she has a responsibility to “leverage her privilege” and protest.
“I liked everything Trump was saying, but I didn’t like the crowd,” said Andrew Hutner, a fifth-year in mechanical engineering who supported Trump in the 2016 election. He didn’t think the disruption was productive, but also didn’t like the crowd’s reaction.
“Trump has a polarizing effect,” says Hutner. His main takeaway from the rally was that “everyone needs to calm down.” 
At Carnegie Mellon, Hutner says he doesn’t have many political conversations. He thinks that most students at Carnegie Mellon are not very politically involved, which he says is “one of the reasons I like CMU.”

During the first-ever Tartan Community Day, students attended a presentation on the results of a multi-year study on personal well-being among the Carnegie Mellon student body, gathering together and enjoying ice cream sandwiches in the Rangos Ballroom. The presentation was given by David Creswell, a professor in Dietrich College’s psychology department and principal investigator for the project they call Life@CMU.
“This project is so distinctly CMU,” President Jahanian stated, describing the project as being centered on science and data analytics to improve student wellbeing. “The Life@CMU study illuminates the nuanced ecosystem of individuals, traditions, culture, that make up our community. It has allowed us to better understand the CMU experience and draw on the data that’s collected to influence our interventions, programs, and resources.”
Concluding his introductory statement, Jahanian added, “I want all of you to know that no one is immune to feeling alone or vulnerable at times… not even your president. But in moments of uncertainty we must remember that we are a community. There is an incredible network of support that surrounds us. Use it. Lean on one another. This is one of the most profound ways in which we can act as a community and also thrive as individuals.”
Creswell described the goals of the project as an attempt to “better understand the culture at Carnegie Mellon, the stress culture… we wanted to understand stress, we wanted to understand mental health and sleep patterns here in our students so we can better help our students, with their health and academic success.”
Before going into the Carnegie Mellon-specific results, Creswell provided context for the growing mental health problems in our broader society. As an example, he pointed to findings from a study that tracked mental health outcomes of a nationally representative sample of people in the U.S. that found there was a 50 percent increase in major depression diagnoses from 2009 to 2017 among younger Americans.
Phase I of the Life@CMU project followed a sample of first-year students over the course of the 2017 spring semester. The following spring Phase II tracked first-year and sophomore students over the semester as well. They were able to track 85 students who participated in both phases to examine their transition from being first-years to sophomores.
They gathered data on factors of students’ well-being and experiences, including sleep, stress, depression, loneliness, and life satisfaction, looking at students’ baseline scores at the beginning though the end of each semester. They also used Fitbit sensor data and phone information to sample for patterns in usage and activities over time.
The Life@CMU study also used experience sampling on participants’ phones to survey what students are doing during their waking hours, finding that on average 50 percent of that time is dedicated to school-related work. Students also used 29 percent of their waking hours for what Creswell described as the “catch-all” category of personal time, 9 percent on eating, 6 percent on naps, and 4 percent on exercise. Students also reportedly spent an average of three hours on their phones per day, which many people at the event were surprised wasn’t higher.
“A lot of this is tip of the iceberg stuff that I think is really important and can generate some important conversation around what the CMU experience is like,” Creswell explained.
They found that 8 percent of the Phase I students at their pre-semester baseline showed high-risk stress scores, but that escalated to 58 percent of students by finals week. Additionally, Creswell says there is a “ratcheting up” of stress scores for students going into their second spring semesters compared to their first spring, with pre-semester stress scores being higher among sophomore than first-year students.
Following the same trend with depressive symptoms among students, the project found that 34 percent of Phase I participants had been scored at high risk for major depression diagnosis at the beginning of the semester, but by finals week 58 percent of participants scored as being high risk. Creswell explained then explained that while the measurement they used “is not diagnostic of whether you have a major depression diagnosis, but it’s a really important predictor” for finding who may be at risk.
When they measured loneliness they found that it was consistently high throughout the semester, leading to likely increases in stress and depression. Creswell made note that “if you come into the semester with high loneliness scores it predicts you having increasing depression over time.” He also acknowledged that the high levels of loneliness surprised them as they expected the college environment would run counter to loneliness.
Creswell stated that he wants to talk more about loneliness and that we should start a dialogue on trying to understand loneliness among younger adults, especially noting why it might be higher than among other generations.
Based on the results of the study, one of the narratives Creswell is trying to adjust is that Carnegie Mellon has a unique stress culture. “I think there’s a lot of stress, but I don’t see anything that suggests that our stress culture may look a whole lot different than other college student cultures,” he said.
Depression levels in Carnegie Mellon, Creswell stated, are “similar depression scores to other college samples… nonetheless, we’ve still been really concerned.” This same similarity can be seen in student’s loneliness scores as well.
One of Creswell’s main “myths” that he was trying to dispel with this presentation was of sleep. While the Life@CMU team found that the average of students’ perceptions for amount of sleep was 5.6 hours, CMU students were found to actually have closer to 7 hours per night.
As the audience laughed at a sleep graph that showing a spike in the average amount during spring break, the professor explained they didn’t find much variance in students’ sleep amounts and schedules. Creswell then showed that they found the average sleep time to be at 2:23 a.m. and the average wake time at 9:30 a.m. He did stress here that these variables are predictive of “mental health and GPA-type outcomes.”
It appears that the mental health situation of Carnegie Mellon students is more complicated, however, as the project team found that life satisfaction scores returned with fairly high scores in comparison to other colleges’ scores. 
“How is it that students could be carrying these depression burdens, particularly as you ramp up over the course of the semester, but also say that I have gratitude and purpose in life?” Creswell asked.
He answers that the students he’s spoken to on this have told him, “This makes sense. I wouldn’t trade being at CMU for anything, but I’m dealing with a lot of these mental health challenges.”
Outlining next steps, Creswell explained how members of the Life@CMU Project have also been using machine learning to predict a student’s depression risk. Additional research currently under review shows that they can predict “end-of-semester” depression with about 85.7 percent accuracy. The professor stated, “Some of the work we’ve been doing shows that even in the first two weeks sensing data can predict with reasonable accuracy who’s likely to be ratcheting up a level in terms of their depression symptoms.”
The project has begun Phase III intervention study for first-year students to examine strategies for improving resilience. Creswell himself will also begin teaching a “Hack Your Life” course for future first-year Dietrich College students in the fall.
As a final call to action, Creswell emphasized the importance of preparing Carnegie Mellon for future at risk students, showing results from a study that found the rate of pediatric emergency room visits for suicidal ideation or attempts has doubled over the past decade. “We really need to think about ways to support each other and to create an institution where we can minimize those who are really struggling with this.”
Creswell describing the message of the Life@CMU Project as twofold: “First, I do think it’s one of hope. We’re seeing high happiness and purpose in life in our students and really an increasing greater availability of mental health resources and initiatives on campus.”
However, echoing Jahanian’s comments, Creswell said, “I also think that the second part of it is that this work is really a call to action among every one of us here. We need to be proactive about helping our current students with their mental health and wellness and hopefully this work really accelerates our efforts our students and thus future generations of students.”

After winning a prestigious DARPA competition in 2016, ForAllSecure, a Pittsburgh-based company launched by Carnegie Mellon faculty, has expanded its collaborations with U.S. Department of Defense's (DoD) Defence Innovation Unit, or DIU. Their products help the DoD detect vulnerabilities in software at machine speed and scale.
According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), as weapon systems become more and more computerized, there are “more opportunities for attacks.” A 2017 DIU contract with ForAllSecure and multiple other design partners aims to be a solution to this problem, improving weapon systems security with the company’s “Mayhem” product. The company calls it a "next-generation fuzzing solution which automatically detects and eliminates vulnerabilities in software."
ForAllSecure was founded in 2014 by David Brumley, a Carnegie Mellon electrical and computer engineering professor, alongside Thanassis Avgerinos and Alex Rebert, both graduates and researchers from Carnegie Mellon. Mayhem, ForAllSecure’s flagship cybersecurity system, initially began as a project from Brumley’s Carnegie Mellon research group.
Chelsea Mastilak, a spokesperson for the company, told The Tartan in a phone interview that the company was started largely on the idea that “cybersecurity plays a huge role in making the country safe.”
ForAllSecure started with a prototype of Mayhem, which was much more productive than previous machines, said the company.
In 2016, with the Mayhem system developed, ForAllSecure entered the Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC), a competition created by DARPA in correspondence with the DEF CON hacker convention. One of seven teams that participated in the competition, ForAllSecure eventually won the competition after showing its strong auto-correcting power in fixing vulnerabilities in software in front of a crowd of over 5000 computer security professionals.
After winning the competition, ForAllSecure signed a contract with the Defense Innovation Unit, an organization under the DoD which aims to implement emerging technology into the U.S. military by contracting with startups and companies.
According to a U.S. GAO October Report of and studies performed by Carnegie Mellon’s Software Engineering Institute, nearly all previous weapon systems had some sort of vulnerabilities. However, only one out of 20 of those vulnerabilities were corrected previously. Seeking to “automate the process [of finding and correcting vulnerabilities in software] for modern developers”, ForAllSecure signed an $8 million contract with the DIU to help eliminate these defects in weapon systems.
Besides its great power in automatically checking for vulnerabilities, Mayhem also “uncovers defects with zero false positives,” according to the company’s website. ForAllSecure were able to achieve such precision by emphasizing reproduction in order to enhance the system. “The analysis engine runs the test case three times to verify that it is able to reproduce the same behavior,” their website states.
Mastilak says that ForAllSecure has completed the three stages of their contract with the DIU and is currently working on collaboration projects with individual clients from DoD. She notes that more clients in the DoD, not limited to the DIU in general, are interested in implementing Mayhem.

“She was one of those students who was smarter than the teacher, and the teacher knew it but wouldn’t say it out loud,” confessed Jim Daniels, English Professor at Carnegie Mellon and former teacher of author Sarah Valentine. Daniels showered Valentine with praise before her MLK Jr. Day Writing Awards speech on her life story and autobiographical book, When I Was White: A Memoir.
During her time at Carnegie Mellon, Valentine was a part of the English Department and the Modern Languages department, where she studied Russian as an undergraduate. She graduated in 2000.
Valentine’s speech was held last Thursday in the Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion. Setting the stage for Valentine’s speech, M. Shernell Smith, Associate Director at the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs, said, “there are times in this room where you really don’t know who’s who. It’s good because we can create this sense of connection.”
“I graduated almost 20 years ago, and it’s great to see how much the university has grown in terms of its engagement with diversity. Even then, the English department was ahead of the curve. The MLK writing awards program started when I was a student,” Valentine said.
Valentine thanked Daniels for his praise. She also thanked him for being an important mentor to her at Carnegie Mellon. Much of her speech and memoirs from her book focused on her senior year at Carnegie Mellon.
When I Was White and the speech she gave at the MLK writing awards focused on Valentine’s struggles with racial identity throughout her life. Raised in an Irish-Italian household by her biological mother’s family and stepdad, Valentine was expected to conform to her European identity by her mother and was unaware that her father was a black man. Valentine has had to grapple with her African-American identity after believing she was white growing up.
Recounting a Saint Patrick’s day festival from her college years, Valentine said she told her friends that she was Irish, to which they responded, “Yeah, everyone’s Irish on Saint Patrick’s day!” Valentine told the audience that, though her friends saw her as other, she felt connected to her Irish identity, and she was terrified to confront this difference she had with her friends.
Valentine also told the audience about how she stole an Irish heritage ring from a vendor at the festival, later tossing it on the ground out of guilt and abandoning it. A guard searched her to no avail when she was reported for it, and Valentine told the crowd that her friends thought she was being racially profiled.
Valentine wanted to confess about the ring badly, and she finally got her chance in Daniels’ poetry class where she got to write about the incident. She joyfully recalled her time as a student with Daniels.
“Jim showed me what it was like to be a poet in real life. He was such a regular guy,” Valentine said, laughing. “That’s a good thing. He was a family man, no one crazy, who was able to show me he could be a good writer. It let me know I could be myself and be a good writer.”
Valentine also told the audience a few heart-wrenching anecdotes from her childhood. She commented on how she was expected to look and act white, and one aspect of this was straightening her hair. Once her mother ironed her hair, painfully burning her scalp.
“I ended up admiring the white girls at my school for their hair. I fell into the role of the well-behaved, well-groomed daughter to satisfy my parents and other adults. I felt like I was in a struggle to please people as a little girl and be myself at the same time.”
“White people had been asking me questions about my identity my whole life and accepted whatever answer I gave them. I was constantly questioned about my hair, family, and ethnicity. I had few black people in her life, and I felt as though I’d been hiding behind my whiteness,” said Valentine.
During the Q&A session, Valentine revealed to the audience that she has yet to figure out who her biological father is. “I had searched before but decided to suspend the search because of how much energy it took. I came to accept that I didn’t need someone else to validate who I was. I’m still interested, but it’s not something I need to know to move on with my life.”
Many of Valentine’s friends and family were in the audience, and they mentioned that talking about Valentine’s dad during her childhood was very much off limits. Valentine described her current relationship with her mom as being a “truce,” and she says she has forgiven her parents, who now recognize her African-American identity.
After Valentine’s speech, Daniels talked with The Tartan about his time as Valentine’s teacher. From 1998 to 2000, Valentine was in every one of Daniels’ poetry workshops. She also participated in a mentoring program Daniels did with high school students at the Pittsburgh High School for the Creative and Performing Arts.
“In class, she wasn’t the student who spoke the most, but when she spoke, she was able to read the subtleties and nuances of poems with amazing depth and insight. She had a warmth and generosity of spirit that set the tone for the class and allowed the other students to be both frank and empathetic with each other,” Daniels said.
“When I first read When I Was White, I found myself underlining and starring passages just like I did when she was my student. On a sentence-by-sentence level, her writing really sings. It’s not just the unusual, provocative story she has to tell, but the skillful way that she tells it that makes the book so special.”

In the Sept. 29 issue of The Tartan, senior Hadrian DeMaioribus had expressed frustration with what he sees as limitations in the recently announced expansion of the Carnegie Mellon commitment to sustainability. DeMaioribus observes that the Sept. 23 announcement did not include specific commitments for staff hires, monetary investments, actionable benchmarks, or the creation of an Office of Sustainability.  We welcome the opportunity provided by his letter to make a few points about what this effort is and is not. 
The Carnegie Mellon Sustainability Initiative aims to take our university to the next level in sustainability education, research, and practice, through the engagement of our entire community.  Decentralized initiative and action, with support from the university leadership when needed and appropriate, is a long-standing characteristic of our campus culture.  In the Sustainability Initiative announcement, Provost Garrett committed to providing support as recommended by a Steering Committee and Advisory Council comprised of faculty, staff, and students that has just begun to meet.  The same Faculty Senate Ad Hoc Committee that encouraged an expansion of efforts in sustainability is supportive of the Sustainability Initiative as the right path forward for Carnegie Mellon and endorsed its alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
We note also the long history of sustainability-related achievement and innovation at Carnegie Mellon as documented by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education’s Sustainability Tracking and Rating System. The fully transparent report catalogs Carnegie Mellon’s achievements that earned the Gold level rating: equal to or better than our peer institutions. 
Yet, we can do more to take advantage of a once in a generation opportunity provided by the SDGs that run through 2030.  This paradigm shift in how communities around the world address sustainability includes, but goes beyond, environmental aspects and addresses, for example, efforts to reduce inequality and increase gender equity.  The Provost’s announcement included a commitment to conduct a Voluntary University Review or VUR, replicating how entities around the world are measuring progress on the SDGs.  In this way, we are part of a global effort, and we will, with the support of volunteers across the Carnegie Mellon community, compile our triumphs and shortfalls as they align with the SDG frame and publicly report the findings next year during the UN General Assembly.  As a first step, we will conduct a university-wide survey of Knowledge, Attitude and Practice to create a baseline of how students, staff, and faculty relate to the breadth of the SDGs, whether passionate about green energy, reducing food waste, halving violence and corruption, or creating smart cities.
What this effort is not is the work of one person alone at Carnegie Mellon.  Elevating sustainability to the next level will require interest, engagement, and initiative across our community.  We encourage all students, staff, and faculty members to get to know the SDGs, get involved, and participate in the Sustainability Initiative. We welcome your ideas at sustainability@cmu.edu
