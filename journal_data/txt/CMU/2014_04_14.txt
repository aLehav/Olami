The 95th annual Sweepstakes competition — better known as Buggy — was a memorable one despite Friday’s preliminary races being washed out due to rain. Fog on Saturday morning delayed the races by thirty minutes, but the streets were soon crowded with enthusiastic campus community members to see one of the biggest events on the Carnegie Mellon calendar. 
The Student Dormitory Council (SDC) buggies came out on top in both the men’s and women’s races, with a margin of over nine seconds in both. This year marked the third year in a row that SDC has won both races in the competition.
There were a total of nine organizations that took part in the races; traditional powerhouses, such as Fringe and Sig Ep, made significant strides from last year. Sig Ep had an exceptional day in the men’s category, finishing second by over two full seconds ahead of Fringe A. 
Sig Ep’s B team gave Fringe A a run for their money, coming in only a fraction of a second after Fringe to take fourth place. In the women’s races, Fringe A finished second and were around seven seconds ahead of SDC’s B team, who finished in third place.
The weather was beautiful once the fog cleared, and the performances from the teams were top notch. The SDC men’s team finished with a time of 2:04.473, which was just a second off the course record despite the challenging conditions of this year’s race. 
The weather has been bad all throughout the semester, and rolls did not start nearly as early as it was hoped. Even though the Sweepstakes committee did their best to organize weekend rolls with cones for the drivers to follow the new path, it was hard for the drivers and pushers to get enough practice. 
Head mechanic for Fringe junior Vivek Nair said “I don’t think any of team’s drivers got enough practice on the course and it made race-day all the more challenging.” 
One of the most talked about topics through this year’s races was the several potholes on hill two, which made the driver’s task exceptionally difficult and resulted in several “Did Not Finish” (DNF) classifications, especially in the men’s category. 
There were two major crashes during the races. The Fringe C team buggy, Banyan, crashed into the curb rather than the hay in the women’s race, and the driver was hospitalized overnight for her injuries. The buggy could not be used for the men’s race later. In the men’s race, SDC B buggy, Vice, lost both of her wheels during the chute turn and spun into the bales.
Besides the top positions, there were several interesting performances from other teams amongst the lower ranked teams too. In the men’s races, SPIRIT A and PiKA B came in fifth and sixth with strong performances, with SPIRIT less than two seconds off of Fringe in third. 
PiKA A looked to be going strong with their sleek buggy and could have competed for a place in the top three, but spun out at the end of hill two. SDC’s B and C teams spun out but looked fast enough for places in the top 10. 
Even their D team gave others like the Fringe B team a tough fight. SPIRIT C, CIA A, CIA B and SDC D rounded out the top 10. The likes of SDC B and C, SigNu A and PiKA A not finishing in the men’s races made the morning dull for some but extremely good for others.
In the women’s races, SigEp’s A and B teams came in fifth and seventh respectively,with PiKA A sandwiched in between, rounding out an excellent day overall for the organization. CIA A finished in fourth place after a reroll improved their time by eight seconds. SPIRIT A came in seventh, while SDC C beat Fringe B to take eighth place. 
The difference between the fifth and ninth places was a mere five seconds, which meant the positions changed throughout the morning. APEX B finished 10th, but were approximately 12 seconds behind ninth place.
First-year mechanical engineering major Aditya Krishnan summed it up perfectly when asked what he thought about Buggy, saying “I have, in my seven months of staying on campus, never seen so much excitement and passion for any single event on campus.” 
The alumni website said of the event, “If you aren’t here for buggy, you’re the one losing race-day.”

Last week, an article titled “Compubookie predicts SDC to win Carnival buggy races” was printed in the sports section of The Tartan. This article contained a section titled “The Field,” in which inappropriate comments promoting racial stereotypes and connotations were printed. The Tartan apologizes for the comments that were allowed to be printed.
Compubookie is an annual article submitted by an anonymous author. The article does not reflect The Tartan’s opinion, nor does The Tartan wish to promote any of the stereotypes that were allowed to be printed. Typically, these types of connotations and stereotypes are removed from the Compubookie submission. This year, the failure to remove all inappropriate comments was an unfortunate editorial oversight, and The Tartan editorial board apologizes for the comments’ appearance in last week’s issue.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track and field teams competed in the Bennie Benson Memorial Invitational  on Saturday against a field comprised of athletes from Division I, II, and III schools. The meet was hosted at Robert Morris University.
The women’s team excelled in the track events. Junior Hailey Brown took home a first-place title in the 3,000-meter steeplechase with a time of 11:57.02. Brown dominated the field, beating the second-place runner by over 30 seconds. 
Senior Jacqueline Guevel grabbed the only other podium place by a Tartan, with a third-place win in the 400-meter intermediate hurdles, crossing the line at the 1:03.99 mark. Guevel also placed seventh in the 100-meter high hurdles with a time of 15.79.
In the short distance runs, junior Sasha Spalding finished sixth in the 200-meter dash, while first-year Ariel Tian placed seventh in the 400-meter run with times of 26.44 and 1:02.92, respectively.
First-year Rebecca Fortner finished with the best time for the Tartans in a field event, placing sixth in the high jump after leaping over the bar at 1.48 meters. 
The men’s team had a bit more success at the meet, starting with the 3,000-meter run. The Tartans dominated the event, claiming five of the top eight spots, starting with senior Josh Newby and his winning time of 8:55.33. 
Juniors Joe Pane and Grant Langevin took third and fourth with times of 8:58.14 and 8:59.83, respectively, while senior Adam Cantini and sophomore Brian Bollens finished seventh and eighth, respectively.
The Tartans also performed well in the 3,000- meter steeplechase, with first-year Curtis Watro and junior Elliot Watson taking first and second with times of 9:50.01 and 10:00.39, respectively. Watro’s time was also a career-best finish.
Rounding out the track events were a pair of fourth- and fifth- place finishes, with junior Ben Walker and first-year Nathan Willis in 800-meter running times of 1:58.92 and 1:59.22, respectively, and first-year Andrew Chang and sophomore Ben Neiman finishing the 110-meter high hurdles with times of 16.07 and 16.11, respectively.
In the jumping events, first-year Kyle Weaver leapt to second place in the pole vault with a 4.60-meter jump that tied his own school record and career best. Junior Michael McDermott finished fifth in the high jump, making it over the 1.85-meter bar.
Because of the increased competition, the Tartan throwers were unable to keep up the dominance they had sustained in previous weeks, claiming only two top-three finishes. 
The honors went to senior Zachary Erra-Hernandez, who finished second in the shot put with a distance of 15.79 meters and third in the hammer toss with a 50.36-meter hurl. First-year Jacob Brooks had a career-best day in javelin, taking home fourth with his 54.23-meter hurl.
Both squads will compete at home on Wednesday at the Carnegie Mellon Tri-Meet.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s golf team participated in the two-day Edward Jones Shootout at The Links at Spring Church in Apollo, Pa. over the weekend. The Tartans entered two teams into the tournament, with the ‘A’ team competing under the school’s name and the ‘B’ team competing individually.
Carnegie Mellon placed third overall with a combined score of 599 over the two days. Senior Ian Bangor led the squad, shooting just six over par for the tournament on his way to a third place overall finish. First-year George Qian was the most consistent Tartan, shooting five over par both days for an eighth place finish. First-year Ryan Karbowicz also shot a total of 150, but was scored as an individual.
The next pair of Tartan’s tied at 11th with junior Cameron Low and first-year Jordan Klodowski, although only Low was part of the team competition. Klodowski had the best turnaround of any Tartan, shooting a fantastic 72 on Sunday.
Rounding out the team competition roster was sophomore Ben DuCarme and first-year Bradley Jennette, who finished 38th.
The team’s next scheduled competition, the Carnegie Mellon Invitational, initially to be held this Tuesday at Longue Vue Country Club, has been postponed. The team’s next competition, the California (Pa.) Vulcan Invitational, will be at Cedarbrook Golf Course in Belle Vernon, Pa. on Saturday.

On the first day of Carnival, comedian Hannibal Buress took the stage at Midway and poked fun at some of the oddities about Carnegie Mellon University. He laughed at our fraternities for standing around, playing a ball-throwing game while blasting “Call Me Maybe.” He laughed at our students for wearing Google Glass. He also jokingly assumed that everyone in the audience was a robot-builder. It seemed that he was almost flabbergasted at the peculiarity of the Carnegie Mellon community.
For that reason, it’s a good thing Buress didn’t stay a day longer to watch the 20th annual Mobot Races, a competition in which participants race autonomous vehicles (Mobile Robots) along the slalom course outside of Wean Hall.
The event took place Friday afternoon amid a downpour of rain. The Buggy races were scheduled for Friday as well, but were rescheduled for Saturday due to the bad weather. However, in true competitive spirit, about 100 people — the contestants, hosts, and audience of the Mobot Races alike — lined up outside of Wean Hall in the bludgeoning rain holding umbrellas, and wearing coats, plastic wrap, and whatever else they could find to keep dry. Rain or shine, robots were going to be raced on that day.
The race track was composed of curved white lines outside of Wean Hall. The robots started at the top of the hill and followed the path to the bottom of the hill. Small metal gates were placed over the white lines, and the robots had to navigate their way through the arches. 
This navigation became challenging at certain points further down the course because there were multiple white line paths that could be taken, but only some of them had the arches that the robots needed to pass through. Each robot was raced individually, and the one that got the farthest in the fastest time was crowned the winner.
To visualize the scene, imagine a crowd of screaming fans lined up on either side of the race track. Now imagine a man dressed in a plaid kilt waving a sword while commentating on the race — this is Greg Armstrong, a senior research technician at the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute. Every time a competing robot successfully navigated through a gate, Armstrong would yell “Hip! Hip!” and all the people surrounding the scene would respond with a loud “Hooray!” Finally, in a great crescendo, when the robot reached the end, hysteria would erupt as the fans cheered wildly.
There were two divisions —  the undergraduate division and the open division — and a winner was crowned in each. 
The undergraduate division champion was Team MoBoss++, composed of sophomore electrical and computer engineering majors Cosku Akay, Kenneth Li, and Nishant Pol, and sophomore mechanical engineering major Sam Zeng. MoBoss++ reached the ninth gate with a time of 1:46.35. 
The Open division champion was Team Revo, represented by Carnegie Mellon University alumnus Daniel Jacobs (CIT ‘13). Revo reached the fourth gate with a time of 0:33.87.
The Ben Brown (Judges) Choice Prize was given to Team Megubot 7, which consisted of Megan McKelvey, a C-MITES student, and her father, Terence McKelvey. Megubot 7 passed through the fourteenth gate with a time of 1:40.65. There was also a Special Mention given to sophomore electrical and computer engineering major Hui Jun Tay and sophomore mechanical engineering major Vijay Sampath. Their Mobot passed through the first gate with a time of 1:31.47.
The Mobot Races are an event that embodies the spirit of Carnegie Mellon. 
Even though not all robots made it through the course, the work that went into each and every one of them was apparent.

Carnegie Mellon has long been known for its excellence in math and science programs, a statement that has been supported by Carnegie Mellon students’ participation in the Mathematical Association of America’s 74th William Lowell Putnam Competition, a mathematics contest for undergraduate students held on December 7. 
Results for the competition were recently released. Thirty-five Carnegie Mellon students scored among the top 10 percent, and the university’s team placed second overall in the Putnam competition.
The Putnam competition began in 1927, but it was not until 1935 that the competition was placed under the control of the Mathematical Association of America and became what it is today. Students participating in the Putnam competition are given six hours to solve 12 complex mathematical problems. This year, 4,113 undergraduate students participated in the competition. Participants came from 557 different undergraduate institutions, both American and Canadian. Three students from each institution formed the teams, which compete for the overall score; other students are allowed to participate for individual rankings.
Carnegie Mellon’s team, coached by Carnegie Mellon assistant professor of mathematical sciences Po-Shen Loh, included sophomore math major Linus Hamilton, junior math major Michael Druggan, and first-year math major Thomas Swayze. 
All three students are Knaster-McWilliams Scholars. The Knaster-McWilliams Scholars program, funded by Alexander M. Knaster (CIT ‘80) and Bruce McWilliams (MCS ‘81), is a scholarship program paired with an honors program. The program offers increased access to faculty and early research opportunities for students.
“I did math contests in high school, so this was a continuation of that,” said Swayze. “Math contests like this were a big focus for me in high school. I put most of my free time into training for math contests since there wasn’t access to university level math courses.”
Swayze also noted the amount of preparation that went into the competition. “For preparation, I took Putnam seminar, which is a class in the fall that is stratified by the various levels that people are at,” explained Swayze. “It’s a couple hours a week; we worked on practice problems and discussed techniques.” The Putnam seminar is led by Po-Shen Loh and allows students to improve their problem-solving skills through complex mathematical problems that require both knowledge and creativity to complete. Students have the opportunity to participate in two competitions, the Virginia Tech Regional Mathematics Contest (VTRMC) and the Putnam competition.
“I basically enjoy the contest because I enjoy math.... It is sort of like a six-hour competition between you and a set of problems, more so than a competition against the other teams. It’s just a question of how many problems you can crack in the allotted amount of time,” Swayze said.
Carnegie Mellon’s team placed second, which secured them a third consecutive year in the top five. The Carnegie Mellon team also secured a spot in the top five in 1946, 1949, 1987, 2011, and 2012. Since the competition began, only 13 universities have placed in the top five over five times. Only 11 other institutions have placed in the top five over two times since 1990.
Carnegie Mellon had 163 students participate individually. 35 students placed in the top 442, the second most out of any university. Hamilton, Swayze, and first-year math major Samuel Zbarsky placed in the top 16.

To kick off the celebrations for National Robotics Week, Chief Technology Officer and Director of Boston Dynamics Marc Raibert delivered this year’s Teruko Yata Memorial Lecture in Robotics this Thursday to members of the Carnegie Mellon community.
Raibert is not a stranger to Carnegie Mellon: He was an associate professor of computer science at the university and a member of the Robotics Institute from 1981 to 1986. While at Carnegie Mellon, he established the Leg Lab, which specialized in developing robots that use legs to move and balance dynamically instead of relying on wheels or treads used by most robots. After moving the lab to The Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1986, he used his work to form Boston Dynamics in 1992. The company does not sell commercial robots, but has instead relied on funding from partners like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to advance the field of robotics through its research. Google recently acquired Boston Dynamics on Dec. 13, 2013.
Raibert’s lecture, “Walk, Bound, Gallop, Climb,” focused on the work Boston Dynamics has done since the success of BigDog, their groundbreaking project from 2005. BigDog is a four-legged robot with dynamic stabilization, which allows it to traverse rough terrain like rocky hills or snow-covered trails. 
It can even recover its balance if shoved. Videos of BigDog have been YouTube hits, generating more than 20 million views and spawning numerous parodies. Raibert and the rest of Boston Dynamics are now aiming to develop the ideas behind BigDog further to create a new generation of robots that are unprecedentedly strong, dexterous, and agile.
One of the robots presented during the event was the Legged Squad Support System (LS3). Like BigDog before it, LS3 is a four-legged robot with dynamic stabilization. In contrast to BigDog, which was noisy and could only travel 12 miles, LS3 is relatively quiet and can travel up to 20 miles while carrying 400 pounds of equipment. DARPA has supported the development of LS3, going so far as to create its own test courses for evaluating the effectiveness of LS3 in the field.
Boston Dynamics is working on advancing the speed of their robots as well. Their Wildcat robot is capable of galloping or bounding short distances across paved surfaces at 16 miles per hour. Cheetah, an earlier tethered robot from Boston Dynamics, could run 28 miles per hour.
Teams at Boston Dynamics are now working on developing humanoid robots with dynamic stabilization. One such robot, PETMAN, can perform a wide array of motions like walking, skating, and stretching. It is intended to help test the effectiveness of clothing that protects against chemicals, a task that has traditionally required humans to perform repetitive movements over many hours. 
PETMAN can perform these very same movements, allowing for the clothing to be tested without the need for humans. Another humanoid robot, Atlas, is designed to traverse rough terrain like that negotiated by BigDog and LS3. Several copies of Atlas are currently being used in the DARPA Robotics Challenge, an ongoing competition to develop robots capable of performing a variety of tasks that could be helpful in disaster scenarios like a nuclear reactor accident.
After the lecture, Raibert fielded questions from the audience. He conveyed openness to considering new ideas and techniques, saying that he tries to avoid being “too religious” in his existing beliefs. When asked about the safety and compliance measures currently in place, he also acknowledged that the company has work to do in making their robots safe for use around humans. 
When asked about Boston Dynamics’s future, Raibert admitted that he could not discuss much about their work since the company was acquired by Google, but later teased that he and his team “are going to make smaller things now.”

Computers are used for a wide variety of purposes, including heavily computational programs that can solve complicated problems. However, is it possible for a computer to create something completely on its own, such as art or new knowledge?
To decide whether or not a computer can create art, art must be defined. A creation can be considered art by either the designer or the beholder. For example, a piece may be considered art by the one who creates it if it tells a story or holds a personal meaning. Therefore, it would be difficult for a computer or program to create art because computers cannot generate human experience or emotion. 
On the other hand, if we look to the opinion of the beholder, even nature could be considered art. By this logic, any computer output that a person views as beautiful could be a candidate for art.
Is it possible to create a program that will produce an output that is not attributed to the work of a computer scientist? For example, media artist Matthias Dörfelt created an algorithm that randomly generates entirely new drawings of faces from scratch. The cartoons highly resemble those drawn by illustrators, yet an artist never conceived the images. However, we must also consider giving credit to the one who wrote the algorithm in the first place. We cannot necessarily say the computer created these images on its own if a human wrote the program.
Yet, we must compromise by admitting that there are impossible tasks that are made feasible by computers. For example, a long computational simulation may make calculations at the rate of a thousand a second, a task that will never be replicated by human beings. Although a computer is instrumental in producing these calculations quickly, a human could do it at a slower rate. The computer can only make a unique creation if a human does not know how to replicate the output.
If a computer can generate undiscovered concepts and produce a unique output, why should we care? Just because a computer has generated a solution to a complicated algorithm, it will be difficult to convince people to trust it. As students in a heavily computer science-oriented school, we are aware of the seemingly infinite capabilities of computers. We leave it up to you to decide whether these computers are capable of generating unique and creative material.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of their discussion on whether computers can contribute new knowledge.

Today, smartphones can be used to triangulate a person’s position within a few meters from almost anywhere on the Earth. Despite having this advanced technology, the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which vanished on March 8, 2014, is still ongoing, and there have been no traces of the plane. Much of the world has been shocked at how a Boeing 777-200 jetliner carrying  239 people on board can simply disappear without a trace.
After the plane’s communications were disabled, the only data from the plane were a series of pings to Inmarsat 4-F1, a communications satellite that sits perfectly stationary above the equator at the Indian Ocean.
Unfortunately, three satellites are required to determine an object’s location on the earth. A single satellite can only measure distance based on the time it takes for radio waves to go from the object to the satellite. A sphere can be generated with this distance, as the radius and the object can be anywhere on this sphere. By having two satellites and two distance measurements, the object is confined to anywhere on the intersection of the two spheres. A third sphere can be used to find the intersection of all three and, thus, the location of the object.
Based on the single Inmarsat data, searchers identified two possible paths for the plane on the one sphere they generated. The Guardian reported that engineers working for Inmarsat used a clever approach that involves the Doppler effect to determine the plane’s final path.
The Doppler effect is when sound, light, or radio waves are emitted from a source and the observer receives a changed frequency of waves. If the source is moving toward the listener, the distance between successive waves decreases so they bunch together, increasing the frequency. Conversely, if the source is moving away from the listener, the distance increases between waves and frequency received drops.
Analysts identified slight changes in the frequency of the radio waves that the satellite received from the plane and deduced that the plane was traveling south away from the satellite at the equator. The plane’s last ping was then deduced to be about 1,500 miles away from the coast of Australia.
Now that the general location of the plane is known, the task of searching through the southern Indian Ocean remains. Search teams are listening for a black box flight recorded, which sends pings for about 30 days a distance of two miles. They must identify a ping that lasts 9.3 milliseconds, a tenth of the time of a blink of the human eye that is repeated every 1.08 seconds in a vast ocean that is filled with many other noises.
CNN reported that a Chinese and Australian search vessel heard pings at the right frequency on April 5 but have not heard them since. An official close to the search is now reporting that the batteries on the black box are most likely dead. 
After one month of searching, MH370 has eluded the whole world, seeming to simply disappear into thin air.

[BOLD]Blood moon to occur on Tuesday[BOLD]
On Tuesday night, there will be a blood moon — a total lunar eclipse during which the moon will turn a burnt reddish orange as it passes through Earth’s shadow. This eclipse is the first of four total lunar eclipses, each of which will feature a blood moon. The four blood moons will occur on April 15, 2014, Oct. 8, 2014, April 4, 2015, and Sept. 28, 2015. However, despite this apparent frequency, these are not commonplace events. 
Though there are about two lunar eclipses per year, most are penumbral, so they are vaguely visible and often go unnoticed. According to CNN, “getting four umbral (total) eclipses in a row is like drawing a rare lunar poker hand of four of a kind. The astronomers’ name for this lucky draw is a tetrad.”

[BOLD]Google Glass helps Parkinson’s victims[BOLD]
Researchers at Newcastle University are exploring the use of Google Glass to assist patients with Parkinson’s disease in monitoring their symptoms and increasing their mobility. 
The voice-enabled device is especially useful in scenarios when the patient’s syndrome renders them immobile. In such a case, the patient is able to use Google Glass to orally place a phone call or connect them via video to a family member. In addition, the sensors in Google Glass can measure eye and hand motion and notify users if their symptoms become worse.

[BOLD]iPhone app helps overcome jet-lag[BOLD]
Researchers have developed a mobile app called Entrain to help people overcome jet-lag. They developed a method to synchronize the body clock based on the assumption that light from the sun — mainly the blue wavelengths — is the strongest signal to the circadian rhythms, which correspond to the body’s internal clock. Their app guides the user to be in light or darkness at particular times to ensure their speedy adjustment to a new time zone. 
Since the shortcuts prescribed by the app often require light or darkness at an unusual hour, one can wear pink-tinted glasses during the day to block the blue wavelengths from the sun and simulate darkness, or use a therapeutic light to simulate bright outdoor light at night.

[BOLD]Tissue engineering reconstructs nose[BOLD]
Scientists at the University of Basel, Switzerland, have been able to use tissue engineering to reconstruct the human nose. They extracted cartilage cells from patients’ nasal septa, multiplied them, and expanded the cells onto a collagen membrane. This collagen membrane was then shaped according to the defect and implanted. This method improves upon the earlier method of taking grafts for reconstruction from the nasal septum, the ear, or the ribs, and using those to reconstruct the nose.

This year’s Carnival Concert turned the Cut into a filthy, beautiful party on Friday with an energetic performance from popular artists Icona Pop and Mac Miller. Icona Pop are Swedish EDM-pop crossover artists well-known for their 2012 anthem of reckless abandon “I Love It,” and Miller, a Pittsburgh native, has made a good name for himself with such white-boy party classics as “Donald Trump” — which even earned the interest of the walking comb-over billionaire himself in a trademark suit — and the kind of precisely trimmed facial hair that is only capable with a high-quality electric razor.
The night opened with a performance by student musician Kai Roberts, a senior business administration major. Roberts played songs off his debut album, Carnegie Café, which details his own experiences with Carnegie Mellon stress culture. The fact that audience members were singing along with many of his songs revealed his large fan base among students.
Icona Pop opened the night with a series of high-energy club bangers that had the crowd pumping their fists and getting down. Their performance of the recent single “It’s My Party,” which samples the 1965 hit by Lesley Gore of the same name (It’s my party and I’ll cry if I want to!), got everybody in the crowd moving and was a great example of electronic music’s recent trend of taking what’s old and making it new through remixing and sampling. 
The female duo kept the crowd hyped by fully throwing themselves into the performance and frequently interacting with the crowd. Before jumping into their signature tune, “I Love It,” the duo played a brief mix of hip-hop songs that included crowd favorites such as “Pour It Up” by Rihanna and Juicy J’s “Bandz A Make Her Dance,” that created a thick air of anticipation.
Mac Miller’s set suffered from the artist’s own limitations as a musician. Miller’s brand of party-rap works when it connects anyone and everyone with catchy choruses and nice beats — and it was at these moments that the performance was truly captivating — but his recent experimentations with avant-garde “acid rap” — which are plenty interesting while consciously listening with headphones in between classes — didn’t quite land in the live setting and had the crowd checking their phones and carrying on chitchat.
Songs, such as his early hit “Knock Knock,” were fantastic experiences in the camaraderie of it all, but unknown new songs, and many of the recent ones, didn’t spark any connection and felt like forced listenings. Miller teased the use of more classic, 90s-style hip-hop beats, which elevated his music to a much more mature level and hopefully becomes a constant in his future releases. Perhaps Miller may be successful in his recent attempt to be taken seriously, if only he can keep up a consistent and quality product.
What kept Miller going was his own undeniably charming personality. His frequent shout-outs to Pittsburgh — and Squirrel Hill in particular — elicited a fair amount of cheers and kept the moment feeling special. Miller made a concerted effort to engage the crowd — multiple songs were prefaced by a call to “put your hands in the air” — and was often met with a warm response. By the end, however, getting loud began to feel like more of an obligation than a privilege.   
Despite the few downsides, what made the Carnival Concert a great event was seeing the students of Carnegie Mellon get lost in a celebration on the Cut, right in front of the rows of academic buildings that we are forced to lose ourselves in almost every other day of the semester. The concert was two hours of letting loose and enjoying being young, which is a feeling Carnegie Mellon students should probably feel more often.

The sun was shining, the wind was blowing gently, and on the Morewood parking lot, lines for booths snaked endlessly across the pavement this weekend for the one-hundredth Spring Carnival: Best of the Best.
From Pirates of the Caribbean to One Booth to Rule Them All, the booths were a hit with visitors: alumni, families, and students alike.
Fraternity and sorority official winners Sigma Phi Epislon’s Lord of the Rings booth and Kappa Alpha Theta’s Pirates of the Caribbean booths were similarly fantastic, featuring intricate details that paid homage to the classic stories they portrayed.
This year, we award our second annual Boothy Awards in what were, although not necessarily category winners, some of the best booths of the 100th Spring Carnival. Without further ado, here is the second edition of the Boothies.
The Hipster Boothy for Best Design
Fringe’s booth “Pittsburgh: The Best City in the World” was unlike any we’ve seen during our time at Carnegie Mellon. Fringe creatively topped its booth with a yellow bridge similar to those Downtown. Better yet, Carnival-goers could walk up a flight of steps to cross the bridge, and what better place for a picture opportunity is there than on top of a bridge?  Fringe also provided visitors with a sprawling view of the rest of the Midway with this design. While less impressive than the structure overhead, the room beneath the bridge — containing a racing game that allowed players to use water guns to squirt their own rubber duck through the three rivers of Pittsburgh to the finish line — was still an enjoyable experience.
The Pong Boothy for Best Game
While not strictly a game like the one in Sig Ep’s Lord of the Rings booth, Alpha Phi’s Monster’s Inc. booth provided children with light-hearted entertainment through their activity. Sisters of the sorority surrounded a bed in which a still child, constructed from papier mâché, lay. The sisters asked visitors to scream to wake the child up. When they screamed, he popped straight out of bed, like the child in the simulator in Monster’s Inc. does when scarers like Sully put on their fiercest growl. While seemingly less intensive than some other organizations’ activities, Alpha Phi’s scare game was creative and charming.
The Andy Warhol Boothy for Best Art
The ASA Charlie and the Chocolate Factory booth was colorful, fun, and wacky — one that Andy Warhol surely would’ve loved. The swirling pinwheels on the front of the house were one of many eye-catching features that made this booth worthy of the recognition for best art. Their crazy color schemes and the candy cut-outs were well suited for the booth, and the whole experience was fun and playful. ASA’s work paid off this year, and the booth featured the best art on Midway.
The Andrew Mellon Boothy for Most Underrated Booth
Delta Delta Delta’s St. Jude Hospital booth was not only whimsical and fun, but had an additional philanthropic aspect that other booths did not. The booth was modeled after the hospital, which works with children who are battling cancer. Featuring the playroom, the prom room, and the celebration room, the booth represented an ongoing commitment to charity more than a three-day structure. The final room included an area for donations to the hospital as well as a place for visitors to write down what they’re thankful for. Beautiful, magical, and heart-warming, the St. Jude booth deserved to be recognized.
The Hannibal Buress and Tig Nataro Boothy for Funniest Booth
Alpha Epsilon Pi’s The Simpsons booth was bound to be funny, and the fraternity delivered well. The booth was based on the popular, long-running and hilarious TV cartoon The Simpsons and played on familiar themes from the show in a manner that was humorous and effective. The booth was structured like the house from the show and featured quirky details and numerous references to the show to delight fans, such as a copy  of the “In Rod We Trust” magazine cover and a book titled “Drinking Games for the Advanced Alcoholic.” A walk through this booth was sure to be laughter-filled, making it our clear choice for funniest booth.
The Andrew Carnegie Boothy for Best Overall Booth
We hate to be unoriginal, but there was no comparison: Sig Ep once again built the best overall booth. Expectations were high, but the fraternity managed to once again go above and beyond. The sheer scale of the two-story recreation of the Hobbit house — from the tiniest details that were thoughtfully incorporated to the design to the incredibly advanced video game on the second floor — was even more impressive than last year’s Up booth. The effort they put in clearly paid off.
Conclusion
This year’s booths were some of the best we’ve seen while at Carnegie Mellon. Many of the booths seemed significantly more complete than those constructed last year, and it was apparent that organizations put their all into making their booths live up to the hype surrounding the 100th Spring Carnival. This year’s Spring Carnival committee gambled big with the theme “Best of the Best” by giving students open reign to build any booth they desired, but it was clearly the right choice for such a milestone celebration.

“This is what Google Glass is made for!” said stand-up comedian, actor, and Spring Carnival Comedy Show headliner Hannibal Buress. And he was right: The Spring Carnival Comedy Show with comedians Tig Notaro and Buress was the best I’ve seen during my four years here, full of potential runaway trains, a ballerina rap, and a certain turkey leg.
Both of the performers are highly-praised stand-up comedians on the cusp of national fame, well-suited for the 100th Spring Carnival’s annual Comedy Show. 
Notaro has been performing comedy for 17 years (having appeared on NPR’s This American Life and Conan), is a writer for Comedy Central’s Inside Amy Schumer, and most notably gained critical acclaim for her 2013 Grammy-nominated stand-up album Live, in which she recounted her deeply personal and recent ordeals with breast cancer, undergoing a double mastectomy, and the death of her mother.
Buress is a stand-up comedian who has worked as a writer for Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock, and released his hour-long Comedy Central special Live from Chicago on March 29. 
After a short delay and an introduction from AB Comedy Chairs sophomore history major Ramya Chinta and sophomore materials science and engineering major Mariana Rodriguez, Notaro took to the stage. She was self-deprecating, whether it came to her own physical appearance or the venue she found herself in. “I’ve been doing stand-up for the past 17 years,” Notaro said, “and walking into a carnival, I feel blessed.” One of the funniest moments was when she recounted trying to impress a classmate with her musical tastes, specifically the introduction to the Rolling Stones’ “You Can’t Always Get What You Want”, and realizing that the introductory chorus was a little lackluster.
Notaro was able to improvise well, both with the Carnegie Mellon environment and the unfortunate crowd interruptions that occurred. While her material on impressions seemed to drag on just a bit too long, her stage presence and good rapport with the crowd made her worthy of being the headliner in her own right.
After Notaro’s set concluded with a standing ovation — despite any annunciation confusion — Buress began with a highly Carnegie Mellon-centric opening. Discussing “Call Me Maybe” playing from a fraternity and how an audience member in the front row was recording the show with Google Glass, Buress was able to personalize and improvise his set with hilarious results.
Buress asked the audience how many people saw his recent Comedy Central special. After hearing the response, he said that it was a good amount of people, but not good enough to not use jokes from the special in his current performance. Any comedy fan who watches Buress thus may have recognized his stories about opening for Tracy Morgan and wanting Will Smith to die before him. However, this comment wasn’t a strike against Buress; it was more of a testament to having incredibly timely, relevant, and entertaining comedians for the Spring Carnival Comedy Show.
While some of the material was familiar, he entertained with new jokes and stories as well. “I’ve taken Adderall just to clean up my apartment, but I never finish,” Buress said. “I get distracted by something from my past, like my high school yearbook.” One of the most interesting aspects of the show was his use of music and prerecorded stand-up bits, triggered by Buress’s DJ and man with the best job in the house Tony Trimm. Talking about how ridiculous rap lyrics can be (“A crib in every state? Both Dakotas?”) and how fraternity hazing must occur at Carnegie Mellon (“You need to build a robot. With mustard. And a coat hanger.”), Buress had the packed Midway Tent consistently amused.
This year’s Spring Carnival Comedy Show was the funniest one I’ve been to since I enrolled here in fall 2010. Notaro and Buress’s solid material, ability to improvise, and crowd engagement made for one of the best events at Carnival this year.

While parties raged through Oakland Saturday night, a group of enthusiastic young filmmakers and filmlovers gathered in McConomy Auditorium for the second annual SHOT FOR SHOT Student Film Festival. The event was created last year by Carnegie Mellon students to showcase innovative work being done by students in Pittsburgh, and the creators successfully accomplished what they set out to do. This year, the event continued to be welcomed by the Pittsburgh community — the festival received over 30 film submissions from four different schools throughout Pittsburgh. One school in particular that took full advantage of this event was Point Park University. Festival Chair and fifth-year business administration major Nick Hurt said the Festival Committee “can safely say that the eleven films we have hand-chosen ... showcase the raw talent, intellect, and ingenuity of student filmmakers coming in and out of this city.”
SHOT FOR SHOT was divided into two programs, the first featuring “PG-rated” short films and the second featuring “R-rated” shorts. Between the two programs, there was a short intermission and a look at some works that are currently in the making.
The eleven films showcased the creativity of the student filmmakers with diverse tones, genres, and plots. The audience experienced everything from dramas and comedies to sci-fi and documentaries.
A highlight from the first program was Milk, a four-minute film directed by sophomore creative writing and information systems double major Chris Compendio. The humorous short follows an argument between two roommates regarding whether milk would spontaneously appear in a cereal bowl if they wait long enough. The film represented a very Carnegie Mellon-esque argument with one roommate’s use of the laws of physics to back up his ridiculous claim that the milk would spontaneously appear. This film was a simple, enjoyable one that kept viewers laughing from start to finish.
Another highlight from the first program was Concealer, co-directed by first-year directing major Ariel Zucker and first-year musical theatre major Iris Beaumier. This powerful short shows four different girls applying makeup. At first, they apply a small amount, the amount that they probably wear on a day-to-day basis. As the film progresses, however, they use more and more makeup until it resembles war paint. 
The film features only loud music rather than dialogue, which grows in intensity with the content of the film. In a filmmakers’ panel after all of the films were shown, Beaumier shared her and Zucker’s inspiration for the film. “I heard this quote once that ‘there are things done to women, and there are things they do to themselves,’ and we wanted to look at that through makeup,” Beaumier said.
An inspiring documentary short in the first program was Throne, directed by Point Park senior film major Nathan Osche. Throne follows the story of Jonathan Stark, who was left paralyzed and in a wheelchair after a serious car crash. Stark refuses to let his circumstances keep him from following his dreams, however, and participates in a sport called wheelchair motocross, or WCMX. Stark’s continual optimism and determination to do a backflip in his wheelchair is inspiring, and fulfilling as he accomplishes his goal.
The second program was much darker in tone and featured some of the most creative story lines. One that stood out in particular was Dot, directed by Point Park senior directing major Garrett Kennell and Point Park junior cinema production major David Light. Dot is about a young girl with OCD who feels she must kill anyone who makes a mess. However, she is taken off-guard when a cute boy takes an interest in her and shows her that messy can be good.
Kennell said the inspiration for the story came to him in the shower. “I had this image of an old fat man in his underwear in his bedroom. And then I thought, ‘What if this guy was a serial killer?’ And then I thought, ‘What if he was an innocent girl?’ And then somehow we went from that to this,” he said.
Much of the making of Dot followed a similar growing pattern. Kennell later added that the short was originally going to be three minutes and cost about $200, but became longer and longer until it got to be the much more expensive thirty-minute film it is now. The directors are hoping to make it into a feature-length film.
Another unique piece in the second program was Rage, directed by senior Point Park film major Ryan Boosel. The film follows Kurt Niles after he came back from the dead to seek revenge on the man who killed him. It resembles movies like Watchmen with its dark, graphic-novel vibe and gory, over-the-top content.
In the end, Rage took the Special Jury Prize, while the Grand Jury Prize went to Throne, and the Audience Award was given to Dot. The Audience Award was chosen after counting ballots that audience members filled out after the end of the second program.
Overall, SHOT FOR SHOT set out what it aimed to do — showcase the diverse creativity and talent of student filmmakers in the Pittsburgh area.

Throughout the years, scores of power-seekers have sought to gain access to the power of hypnosis and mind control to create an enslaved population ready to carry out their bidding at any moment. Luckily, the only people who have such power are benign entertainers such as hypnotist Paul Ramsay, who recently performed a show on Saturday during Spring Carnival.
First, Ramsay did some preliminary testing to see who could potentially come on stage to become hypnotized.
In the first test, Ramsay had the audience close their eyes and hold their hands out. He told them to imagine one hand was full of bricks and the other hand was being held up by balloons. When he finally told the audience to open their eyes, some people had one hand raised and the other lowered; those people, according to Ramsay, were more susceptible to being hypnotized.
Afterward, Ramsay went into another test in which he told the audience to forget their names. He then asked those who forgot their name to come up on stage and did a demonstration showing that he could wipe their names from their minds and bring it back again with the snap of his fingers. He then eliminated certain people who did not properly answer his questions until there were only five people left on stage.
In Ramsay’s show, the audience used remote controls to participate in an interactive poll to decide what actions Ramsay should get the participants to perform next. Unfortunately, much of the value added to the show from this mechanic depended on how far you were away from the screen; the screen was small and on the left edge of the stage, making it difficult to see the text.
First, Ramsay hypnotized the participants into believing they were the founding members of the Carnegie Mellon Ballet Club and had them dance ballet moves on stage. Then he had them hypnotized to do individual behaviors at the mention of a cue word. One guy had extremely itchy nipples. Another participant shouted “WHO’S YOUR DADDY!” whenever Pittsburgh was mentioned. Another person behaved like a pirate captain. One person jumped up from their seat, and another person felt wind blowing in her ear.
At times, the hypnotist seemed to be surprised by the intensity of his powers. For instance, in a segment involving a Guitar Hero championship, at the end Ramsay asked the participants to do a special move. One Asian male performed an intense twerking maneuver (dubbing it “The Korean Sexy”), which seemed to disconcert Ramsay somewhat.
Disappointingly, music always seemed to be cut short in the show. During one segment, when a participant was hypnotized into believing she was Miley Cyrus performing her hit song “Wrecking Ball,” the song was cut off once the twerking started. Also, at the very end, when the participants were encouraged to start a group singalong of Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’,” the song was once again cut short just as everyone had got up and started singing. To call it “killing the moment” would be an understatement.
At the end of the night, Ramsay’s show might not have gotten audience members to believe in the power of hypnosis, but it nonetheless offered an entertaining show full of ridiculous people doing ridiculous things.

Amidst the events and festivities over Carnival, it can be hard to focus on any responsibilities during those few days. 
However, the members of Scotch’n’Soda produced a fantastic and well put-together performance of The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, displaying hard work and focus even during such a busy time. It was great to see quality acting, an interesting and fun storyline, engaging dialogue, and creative set design that involved the audience.
The show is centered around a spelling bee competition in the fictional Putnam Valley Middle School. The characters are the six contestants of the spelling bee, who are each quirky and have complex backstories, as well as two adults who are as equally quirky and ridiculous. 
As the musical progresses, each character reveals a connection to the spelling bee and the importance of winning the competition. Each character has a backstory that deals with a relationship or situation in their life that adds a complex meaning to their participation in the spelling bee. 
Olive (played by sophomore voice major Shannyn Rinker), a shy girl competing in the spelling bee, reveals her distant relationship with her parents — who are not present to watch her compete — and her yearning for their affection. 
Marcy, (played by senior costume design major Abby Botnick), another contestant who appears extremely knowledgeable and intimidating throughout the show, performs a musical number “I Speak Six Languages” in which she reveals the stress and pressure she experiences from her family to excel at many things. After, she purposely misspells a word and is disqualified from the competition. 
The contestants all slowly develop relationships among each other throughout the course of the play, which also affect the outcome of their competition.
The acting in the show was great; each actor portrayed unique mannerisms and voices for the characters, giving an immediate sense of what the characters were like. Rinker maintained Olive’s reserved quality even as she revealed the complexity of the relationship with her parents and performed her musical numbers, especially “The I Love You Song.” 
Barfée, the cocky contestant set on winning, played by junior voice major Ethan Crystal, was humorous and engaging in his tactics, saying “I know” when he was told that he spelled a word correctly. 
The acting made the show humorous, fun, and a pleasure to watch, and was especially impressive for a show like this one that requires a decent amount of comedic improvisation from its actors.
The members of Scotch’n’Soda arranged the plays’ set in such a way as to involve the audience as much as possible. At times, the actors walked through the audience and out the back door of the theater when going off stage. During intermission, an actor portraying a snack boy walked around the audience, and as the show resumed, he went straight from the audience onto the stage to perform his music number “Chip’s Lament.” The audience thus also served as the audience for the spelling bee in the show, adding a creative and engaging touch to the play.
Overall, Scotch’n’Soda put on a great production that was funny and fun to watch. Student reactions were glowing, with first-year undeclared Dietrich College student Laura Gunsalus calling the show “very cute and charming” and first-year business administration student Brian Walsh praising Scotch’n’Soda’s ability to “perform a musical that relies as much on improvisation as it does on written music.” 
The great acting, storyline, and set made the show fun to be a part of. During the busy time of Spring Carnival, it can be difficult to put hard work and effort into a show, but the members of Scotch’n’Soda did a fantastic job with their acting and set design to create a wonderful and engaging spelling bee.

Dear Matt & Ryan,
What’s this I hear about you two graduating? I thought once The Tartan had found two replacements to Patrick Hoskins, I’d be able to pick up a paper once a week for the rest of my life and get bad advice from familiar faces. Don’t go! Stay forever!
How will I say:
Going On Okay, Don’t Bid Yourselves Exit?
Dear GOODBYE,
The only advice we can give you quotes Boyz II Men:
“I don’t know where this road 
Is going to lead 
All I know is where we’ve been 
And what we’ve been through.
If we get to see tomorrow 
I hope it’s worth all the wait 
It’s so hard to say goodbye to yesterday.
And I’ll take with me the memories 
To be my sunshine after the rain 
It’s so hard to say goodbye to yesterday.”
Ryan II Matt
Hey Ryan & Matt,
Carnival ... oh my. It was a blast. I went to a near constant stream of house parties, I lost my voice cheering for my buggy team, my jacket got puked on, I saw alumni I haven’t seen since last year, and I ate a disgusting amount of funnel cake without any shame. The issue is, we still have some time before the end of the semester, and I have no idea how I’m still going to care about classes and schoolwork. How do you recommend I keep motivated?
Sincerely,
Reasonably Intoxicated Person Laboring Intensely, Vanquishing Each Requirement
Dear RIP LIVER,
For starters, Matt and Ryan are out, probably in the same position as you. I’m Josh. So, get up to speed on that. As for what you asked, if graduating and self-respect aren’t motivation enough, you can always try making a game out of schoolwork. Give yourself points for turning in homework assignments or getting up before noon, then compare your scores with your friends.
Because competition is at the heart of every Carnegie Mellon friendship,
Josh

The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug
The journey of Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) continues as he ventures through Middle Earth with the wise old Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellan) and his team of dwarves in the second film of the trilogy of J.R.R Tolkein’s The Hobbit. In an initially unexpected journey that sets up the first movie, Bilbo is forced to team up with dwarf leader Thorin Oakenshield to reclaim Oakenshield’s lost kingdom. What ensues soon after includes everything from giant spiders, elves (ladies, the heartthrob Legolas makes a return — sigh!), and an epic fire-breathing dragon voiced by the one and only Benedict Cumberbatch. Unlike its predecessor, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug jumps straight into action with incredibly imaginative storytelling that manages to be immersive with its special effects and direction. The movie revives the trilogy’s energy and reminds us of the magic that we as audience members can never get enough of.

Carnegie Mellon University held the naming ceremony for the Jared L. Cohon University Center midday Friday in Kirr Commons of the University Center. The event was well-attended, with faculty, administrators, staff, and students standing to watch the ceremony.
Current university President Subra Suresh and members of the university’s board of trustees were all in attendance in the dedication to former university President and current university professor of civil and environmental engineering and engineering and public policy Jared Cohon. The Soundbytes a capella group opened the ceremony and were followed by a brief bagpipe performance.
Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno then took the stage, announcing “I couldn’t be more pleased to join in this celebration of Jared L. Cohon,” continuing, “I am so grateful that my first three years of deanship were under [Cohon]’s leadership.”
Casalegno called the University Center “a hub for student engagement” and “a place for our diverse community to gather and learn about self, each other, the world around us, and to gain new perspectives.” Casalegno explained how, during Cohon’s tenure as university President, the number of student organizations doubled from 140 to 280. She referred to the University Center as a place where students can “take refuge” from their stresses, often at the black chairs, which was the location for this event.
The announcement that the new University Center would be named after Cohon was made through a campus-wide email in March, which explained that the University Center will be expanded and renovated over the course of the next two years. The message explained, “In keeping with CMU’s tradition of naming buildings for past presidents, the University Center will be named in recognition of Dr. Cohon’s many contributions to the success of the university, its students, faculty, and staff during his 16 years as president,” adding, “As the center of campus life, the Cohon University Center will be an enduring and fitting tribute to Dr. Cohon’s extraordinary personal engagement with students and his leadership style that focused on bringing diverse groups of people together to create better outcomes for all.”
Vice Chairman of the Board of Trustees James Rohr took the stage to share a story regarding the search for university president that resulted in Cohon’s selection. He joked that the university “needed to have a unique person as its leader, so it made sense to find a dean of forestry.” Rohr continued, explaining that Carnegie Mellon’s strengths in both the arts and sciences meant it needed a president who could address both these aspects of education.
University Provost and Executive Vice President Mark Kamlet spoke of the study done under former university President Richard Cyert for a committee on student life, which concluded that the state of student life was “rather devastating.” 
It was this committee that spearheaded the construction of the University Center, which University Center administrator Stanley Krowitz said plays an extremely important role for the campus community. Krowitz concluded, “this will truly be everyone’s home away from home on campus.”
The event saw a series of speakers representing alumni, current students, and members of the administration. When President Suresh took the stage, he remarked, “It’s a great day for the Cohon family. It’s a great day for the university.”
During the conclusion of the ceremony, Cohon took to the stage to receive a plaque to be mounted on the University Center’s wall and a framed picture signed by the employees of the University Center. Cohon was then surprised as black drapes were lifted from the balcony walls to reveal his name mounted in letters on the University Center wall.
“This is kind of overwhelming,” Cohon said when he took the microphone, giving thanks for an “unbelievable honor.”
Cohon thanked the staff of the University Center, saying “thank you for letting me put my name on your building.”
“I can’t thank you enough for this incredible honor,” he concluded.

An array of Carnegie Mellon start-ups were on display at Project Olympus’ 18th Show and Tell last Thursday. From providing essential nutrients to solving crossword puzzles, each of the concepts used technology in novel ways.
The event, which took place in the University Center’s McConomy Auditorium, featured distinguished professors and alumni, as well as students and staff. The program highlighted a small selection of the many entrepreneurial activities within Carnegie Mellon.
Illah Nourbakhsh, a professor in the Robotics Institute and the director of the CREATE lab, discussed his efforts to empower people to take charge of environmental issues by arming them with data. Nourbakhsh has made inexpensive air quality sensors and water quality sensors, which are particularly useful for residents near fracking sites. “We want technology which is inherently creative,” said Nourbaksh, who feels his sensors will lead to “public discourse supported by data.”
Boris Sofman (SCS ‘05) presented the most commercially successful product of the event, Anki Drive. Sofman launched his first project, a cyber-physical racing game, last year. Users race on their iOS devices while physical cars move around a track. Sofman discussed the launch of the product at Apple’s famed World Wide Developers Conference last year, and showed a soon-to-be released advertisement. His product is currently sold at all Apple stores throughout North America.
Project Olympus awards exceptional entrepreneurs with Project Oriented Business Exploration (PROBE) grants, which include a $50,000 investment and additional mentorship. Three awardees presented their work, including Elijah Mayfield (SCS’13), who founded Lightside; Mary Beth Wilson (CIT ’13), who founded Innovesca; and Daniel Gorziglia, a sophomore in electrical and computer engineering, who founded AssignLink.
Many of the entrepreneurs presenting attributed much of their success to Kit Needham, the associate director.
“I really leaned on Kit for lots of business mentorship,’ said Wilson in an interview after the show. “I have an engineering background — I’m not a business student.” Wilson’s company processes plants grown in sub-Saharan Africa, which create jobs in an impoverished region, and provide more sustainable nutrition. “We’re developing ingredients with optimized nutrition from underutilized plants in developing regions. We make use of nutrients in food that already exist as opposed to genetically modified foods.”
Gorziglia had a similar appreciation for the work of Project Olympus’ staff. “Kit Needham is my business adviser. We meet biweekly,” he said. “Project Olympus is really good having you connect with people.” And these connections have paid off. Assignlink, which offers innovative calendars for students, has already been implemented in five schools.
Several current Carnegie Mellon students who had won TartanHacks competitions also presented their entrepreneurial work. Out of many projects presented, sophomores in computer science Bram Wasti and Michael O’Farrell, and sophomore human-computer interaction and information systems double major Stefan Dasbach presented a version of RaspberryPi, a computer that costs only $35, that could serve as an Apple Airport, which costs $99. Another project, PuzzelPal, allows users to photograph a crossword puzzle with a smartphone. The app then solves the entire puzzle. Senior computer science major Siddharth Dhulipalla and junior computer science majors Jonathan Goldman and Harsh Pandey created PuzzlePal. The program ended with a speech by Dan Gilman (H&SS ‘04), a Pittsburgh city councilman. Gilman said he wants to transform Pittsburgh’s government to make it friendlier to the plethora of startups which want to stay here, but are often lured to the west coast due to funding and a more functional local government. “We’re behind the times in every front,” said Gilman, “but we can lead with the technology coming out of our schools and our hospitals.”
In an interview after the show, Needham said, “I was thrilled — it’s easy to take a lot of time to explain things, but everyone had only two minutes.” Needham encouraged more Carnegie Mellon students to work with Project Olympus. “My goal is that anyone who has an idea feels comfortable showing up — just to learn.” She emphasized that the ideas do have to be a finished product; the goal of Project Olympus is to help students learn what might work in the business world.

Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, and alumni, as well as members of the surrounding community gathered in the Morewood parking lot on Thursday afternoon for the official kickoff of Spring Carnival, the Midway Opening Ceremony.
The ceremony featured speeches from Head of Booth and senior information systems major Rachel Crown, Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno, university President Subra Suresh, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, and Spring Carnival Committee Co-Chairs senior lighting design major Jackson Gallagher and senior statistics major Emily Hrin, with the rest of the members of the Spring Carnival Committee watching from scaffolding behind them.
Many of the speakers acknowledged Carnival’s importance to the university community, a nod to the fact that this is Carnegie Mellon’s 100th Carnival.
“Carnival is a tradition we all hold very dear in our hearts,” Hrin said. “Carnival has existed for a hundred years while the university has lasted for about 110. So Carnival started very early on in this university’s life.”
“There’s one common theme that stands true throughout the last hundred years of Carnival in that it is the time for the entire campus body to come together, unite, and have a weekend of fun and excitement,” Gallagher said.
“I didn’t realize how important the hundred year anniversary was until [Hrin] said that Carnegie Mellon’s only been around for 110 years,” said sophomore mechanical engineering major Deepak Gopalakrishnan. “After watching the ceremony, I understand why it’s a big deal, why the hundred year anniversary is so important.”
Other speakers remarked on the varied traditions of Carnival and their evolution over time, mentioning Buggy, Booth, plank jousting, circuses, canoe tilts, and bear wrestling.
“[Booth] is only the beginning of what carnival has to offer,” Casalegno said. “This year, and like in the past several years, booth is a representation of the ways that Carnival has grown over the last hundred years.”
“[Carnival] is a celebration of everything that is CMU, through the buggies, and the booths ... and everything else that is a part of it that brings the alumni and the community back,” Peduto said.
Many speakers commented on the pride in Carnegie Mellon and fellow students that Spring Carnival generates.
“[Carnival] is the best weekend to be a Tartan at Carnegie Mellon,” Casalegno said.
“In a uniquely Carnegie Mellon way, this event also brings together the creative spirit of the Carnegie Mellon community,” Suresh said.
Carnival’s ability to connect Carnegie Mellon students and alumni with the surrounding Pittsburgh neighborhoods and foster a sense of community was also a popular topic.
“Carnival is one of the city of Pittsburgh’s longest running traditions,” Peduto said. “It is something that not only includes the university but the community as well.”
“In addition to being a tradition, the Carnival has also evolved over the last several years as the main focal point to connect with the region and the city,” Suresh said.
Each speaker thanked the Spring Carnival Committee, as well as other members of the Carnegie Mellon community, who gave their time and efforts into creating this year’s Carnival.
“I liked that the Carnival Committee was up on the scaffolds during the whole ceremony,” said Sloane Macklin, a first-year biomedical engineering and material science double major. “I liked that they got recognition for all their hard work.”
The ceremony concluded with the cutting of the ribbon to Midway’s entrance and a performance by the Carnegie Mellon Kiltie Band.
“Let’s cut this ribbon and get this party started!” Peduto said.

“Own it.”
That’s the advice that Janet Mock had for those trying to reconcile their sexuality and gender identities.
Mock spoke at Carnegie Mellon in Porter Hall’s Gregg Hall as part of her spring book tour after publishing Redefining Realness: My Path to Womanhood, Identity, Love & So Much More earlier this year.
In 2011, then-editor of People magazine, Mock revealed in a Marie Claire profile that she is a trans woman. Mock’s new place in the public eye let her speak openly about her experience; Mock is often seen as an advocate for trans and LGBT rights. 
She wrote Redefining Realness to tell the story of her upbringing in Honolulu and transition — Mock flew to Thailand alone at the age of 18 for gender reassignment surgery — and the lessons she can give to trans youth and others like her.
The book talk was moderated by associate professor of art Suzie Silver and assistant professor of communication at the University of Pittsburgh Shanara Reid-Brinkley.
Mock spoke about her memoir, as well as current issues surrounding trans and LGBT rights and identity, responding to questions from both the audience and the moderators.
Earlier this year, Mock received media attention for her responses in a Piers Morgan interview that opened with him saying, “This is the amazing thing about you — had I not known your life story, I would have absolutely no clue that you ever would have been born a boy. A male.” 
Morgan’s interview with Mock sparked outrage on social media and across the internet until Mock returned to Morgan’s show and corrected his perspective on what it means to be trans.
When an audience member at Mock’s talk asked about the experience, she explained how she coped, as well as how she responded. “I unplugged,” Mock said. “I didn’t engage in social media; I let that all go ... before the second appearance I prepared myself. I was talking to people all day, having conversations about this. I knew I was walking into the lion’s den, so I was prepared for that — I had my battle-ready dress.”
Mock also addressed recent controversy surrounding RuPaul’s use of the word “shemale” in an episode of the show RuPaul’s Drag Race, in which contestants had to guess whether pictures of various body parts were “female or shemale.”
Mock acknowledged RuPaul’s role as a drag icon and advocate in her own adolescence, but encouraged a conversation about the blurred lines created by the appropriation of anti-trans slurs. “I lived for RuPaul growing up,” Mock said. “I liked seeing this big, black, blonde drag queen on Mac billboards and counters as a 12- or 13-year-old; it was revolutionary for me and my idea of myself and what gender was.... But I also think there needs to be more conversations and engagements with [the drag] community about their celebration of terms that are used violently toward trans women.”
Another audience member asked Mock how to deal with the intersection of race, and gender and sexual identity. Mock spoke about the grassroots organizations — many run by people of color — that she works with, such as the Audre Lorde project, which according to its website is a New York City-based “Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Two Spirit, Trans and Gender Non-Conforming People of Color community organizing center.”
“I think those [organizations] are models to celebrate and speak up,” she said. “In terms of ‘why aren’t people paying attention to this,’ it’s because they don’t care, and I think that oftentimes people in power just don’t care.”
Maureen Meyer, a junior professional writing major, was interested by Mock’s narrative. “I enjoyed the idea of naming yourself as being empowering; I thought that was an interesting conversation,” Meyer said. 
“I’m also taking a class on the rhetoric of narrative this semester, and the construction of identity and retroactive significance of everything to constructing identity was interesting to me.”
Mock ended her talk by discussing what’s next for her. After appearing on a HuffPost Live segment about trans activism, Mock said she wants to create more content and make more appearances, as well as continue writing — she is going to a month-long women’s writer’s residency in August to work on her next book, which will focus on the “aesthetics of beauty culture,” Mock said.
Mock’s talk was organized by the Garden of Peace Project, an organization meant to “increase the emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual well-being of all people, including the most vulnerable, marginalized populations, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression of Southwestern Pennsylvania,” according to its website.

Recently, Texas District Judge Suzanne Covington ruled that the Texas Department of Criminal Justice must inform the attorneys of two death row inmates of its new source of pentobarbital, the substance used for lethal injections. However, the Texas Supreme Court put Covington’s order on pause, stating that the issue must be studied further.
Texas was forced to find a new source of lethal injections after companies from foreign countries opposing the death penalty — which are nearly all of those in the developed world — refused to continue to sell the ingredients for this killer substance. While the rest of the world continues to move away from totalitarian forms of punishment, states like Texas continue to uphold them.
America, the “Land of the Free,” remains in fifth place for the most executions worldwide, behind China, Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. Interestingly, if one were to only count Texas’s 16 executions last year, discounting the 23 others nationwide, America would only drop two slots on the international scale. This fact means there are only six countries reported in the world, besides the United States, that carry out more executions than Texas.
Therefore, the recent debates come to a bigger question. Does the fact that nearly every other developed nation in the world opposes the death penalty, and therefore refuses to sell us ingredients for our lethal injections, mean that perhaps we should move forward and follow the world’s example?
An argument cannot even be made that it is cheaper to simply kill someone than imprison them for life. According to Fox News, “a death-penalty trial costs $1 million more than one in which prosecutors seek life without parole.” According to the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice, “the additional cost of confining an inmate to death row, as compared to the maximum security prisons … is $90,000 per year per inmate. With California’s current death row population of 670, that accounts for $63.3 million annually.” Therefore, Fox News is not exaggerating when it says, “Every time a killer is sentenced to die, a school closes.”
Because the death penalty increases state spending, is a blatant violator of the Eighth Amendment, and represents a totalitarian view that the rest of the developed world has already abandoned, why continue to support it? The buzz created by this case is not simply a question of whether a person has the right to know how the state is killing its citizens; it is a question of whether or not the state should have the right to do so at all.

If you’re an enrolled student at Carnegie Mellon, there’s a good chance that you’ve also enrolled in the school’s dining plan. While the plan itself is straightforward, the block schedule can be confusing to newcomers and veterans alike. Only one block can be used per “meal,” and the start and end times of those meals can be fairly inconvenient for students. Dining Services should change its block “meal” times or else do away with scheduled blocks altogether.
Blocks run on a straightforward schedule: breakfast from 3:30 to 10:30 a.m., lunch from 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., dinner from 4 to 8 p.m., and late night from 8 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. On closer inspection, though, these times appear puzzling. It makes little sense for breakfast blocks to end at 10:30 a.m., especially on weekends, when students might be getting out of bed half an hour before. I can’t say that I know any students who have dinner at 4 p.m., either. It seems silly, as well, to have a late night block at 8 p.m., when students getting out of a late recitation or lab might have their first chance at an evening meal, rather than at 9 p.m. or later.
The current meal block schedule seems much more styled to a significantly-older person’s timetable, and fails to take into account the fact that college students tend to eat, study, and stay up later than other demographics. The 8 p.m. deadline on the dinner block is a nuisance and finding breakfast on the weekend can be difficult when only two locations — Skibo Café and Carnegie Mellon Café — are even open during that time. The lack of flexibility is the system’s biggest concern: If a student has breakfast at 10:45 a.m. and wants to have lunch at 3 p.m., they’re pretty much out of luck.
To fix this system, Dining Services could simply shift the block schedule to a later time to better match student activity. Polls distributed to the student body through email and social media, for example, certainly wouldn’t go amiss. While this solution probably wouldn’t work for everyone, it would fix a majority of issues while still encouraging healthy eating times. It’s also clear that if the system as a whole remains, on-campus eateries need to moderate their opening and closing times to better meet student needs.
There are also more drastic solutions. Dining Services could introduce an overlapping block system in which breakfast blocks run from 7:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m., but lunch runs from 11 a.m. to, say, 5:30 p.m. (with dinner beginning at 5 p.m.). Alternatively, it could do away with block scheduling entirely. 
While this solution would simplify things and minimize inconvenience, it might do more harm than good to Carnegie Mellon’s goal of campuswide healthy eating habits. A compromise, perhaps, might be to allow the use of two blocks — rather than just one — in any given meal period.
For its simplicity and ease of implementation, the solution to shift the schedule should be Dining Service’s first action. While neither a complete nor permanent fix, it would be a good way to remove many students’ pressing concerns. Future changes would likely rely on the ability of student government to interface with Dining Services. It seems promising that now, after the recent student body elections, we will see some interest in changing this antiquated system.

We are witnessing the rise of the cities, according to this week's Freakonomics podcast. Massive metropolises dot the globe. Supercities attract talent and ambition. Extraordinary power, fame, and wealth are the spoils of success in these urban arenas. The inhabitants of these cities are not so much American as they are New Yorkers, not so much British as they are Londoners, not so much French as they are Parisian, not so much Indian as they are Mumbaikars, not so much Chinese as they are Beijingers. The modern man is a uniquely urban animal.
In the United States, the 100 largest metropolitan areas are home to two-thirds of the national population and generate three-fourths of this nation’s annual gross domestic product. They house this many millions and produce this much economic output while occupying only 12 percent of the country’s land mass.
In an era of extreme partisan gridlock in Washington, D.C. and in state capitols all across the country, the city hall is emerging as an energetic and innovative forum for tackling pressing political issues. Mayors across the country are amassing greater political prominence at the expense of the esteem once commanded by state governors, federal legislators, and the American president. City governments are proving far more nimble than state or federal institutions in addressing a variety of public policy questions.
Mayors are institutionally pragmatic. They are charged with solving problems, not stoking partisan fires. They get things done because they must, unlike our increasingly sclerotic national government. As legendary 99th New York City Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia once put it, “There is no Republican or Democratic way to pick up the garbage.” Such urban pragmatism extends to policing the streets, educating our children, and building next-generation modes of transportation. Pragmatism trumps the reflexively ideological nature of our national politics. Cosmopolitan cooperation between cities will one day trump parochial nationalism. Entrepreneurial mayors, whose constituencies are more united and less ideological than those of state governors, federal legislators, or the president, are the most potent force for new ideas in American politics.
Unlike state governors and federal legislators, mayors are fiscally and legally constrained in serious ways. Their zeal to make a deep impact on national issues is contained by the limited scope of their regional offices. The limited size of the revenue streams they control limits the scope of their policy platforms. However, these limitations must be kept in mind only so that mayors can efficiently marshal their time and efforts. Public-private partnerships, facilitated by City Hall, can greatly expand the range of options available to an entrepreneurial mayor trying to resolve long-term and deep-seated political problems in his or her city. Purposive cooperation with other cities can develop regional norms of governance that could produce visionary public policy without abusing the geographic boundaries of a mayor’s constituency.
Political power is devolving to the site of the real action — the city. Political energy is gathering in these cities, where social change must necessarily happen. They are replacing the nation-state as the engines of political progress. They are the newest stars on the political stage. The polis gave birth to democracy, and the cosmopolis will renew it. We are living in the Age of the City.

An article published in last week’s issue of The Tartan, titled “#CancelColbert fiasco is social justice gone wrong,” argued that the #CancelColbert hashtag was an overreaction which failed to further any legitimate social justice causes.
The definition of satire, according to dictionary.com, is the “use of irony, sarcasm, ridicule, or the like, in exposing, denouncing, or deriding vice, folly, etc.” But like all things, this word also has a social context outside of the dictionary definition that must be taken into account. Satire, as history has taught us, is supposed to mock the privileged classes, not the minorities. Satire is supposed to punch up at the oppressive social structure, not down at people who continue to be oppressed. The tweet that started the viral #CancelColbert Twitter hashtag did none of these things.
The tweet — “I am willing to show #Asian community I care by introducing the Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever” — was posted by The Colbert Show’s twitter account as an out-of-context reference to a joke Stephen Colbert made on the show several weeks prior. 
The tweet was supposed to highlight the hypocrisy in Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder running a charity for Native Americans, considering the racism inherent in the Redskins’ name and mascot. It was supposed to be satire exposing racism, but it used racism in order to do that.
This kind of satire — which uses one oppressed minority to emphasize the wrongs done to another — never works. How many people are actually talking about the Redskins now, rather than talking about Colbert or the tweet itself? Even the article written in this paper last week had very little mention about the cause that Colbert used to justify the tweet — that and his usual play of ducking and covering under the word “satire,” of course. There has been no call to action, no discussions, nothing about the Redskins.
Taken in context, the joke does criticize the name, and the hypocrisy that Colbert wanted to call attention to has been received. But the real issue is that he still used this call-out as a sort of comic relief. The words “Ching-Chong Ding-Dong” are indeed reaffirming in the tweet that they are just as racist as “Redskins,” but the problem is that Asian people are still the butt of this joke, even if it may have been criticizing the people in power. Satire should never be used to demean a group that is already oppressed by throwing out words that have always been used to degrade, mock, or patronize that group.
Also, if the point of the tweet was that “Ching-Chong Ding-Dong” was just as racist as “Redskins,” what gives Colbert the right to use those words at all? It sets up the idea that Colbert — and other white, heterosexual, cisgendered men in positions of power — can be so obviously not racist that they are above racism. That even if something he said is racist, his intentions were not and, therefore, he’s still not racist.
The thing is that intentions don’t matter in these discussions. The very valid feelings of many in the Asian-American community do matter. While some Asian-Americans might have been okay with the tweet, others were most definitely not, and it’s important to take into account the full range of public response in this discussion.
It’s not just about hurt feelings, either. The words that Colbert used in his tweet have been used against Asian-Americans to systematically oppress for a long time, and that kind of hurt doesn’t just go away because the tweet was supposed to be satire.
Colbert is a white man with huge amounts of privilege and access. He has many avenues through which he can affect change. I’m disappointed that he would flaunt his privilege in such a way.

Can you describe an entire person with a checklist? Probably not, but that hasn’t stopped collegefeed from trying. 
This year in collaboration with collegefeed and Carnegie Mellon’s Career and Professional Development Center, Carnegie Mellon students will participate in the first-ever digital career fair, starting April 21. 
Students who wished to participate filled out a profile and named three companies they were interested in by April 5. Collegefeed then used this information to match students with potential employers. Collegefeed then sends the profiles of possible candidates to the companies, who make a final decision on who to contact.
The digital career fair does offer benefits for busy students. In-person career fairs can consume a large amount of time and yield little benefit, and the digital career fair cuts down on time wasted waiting in lines only to be told to go to the company’s website. If the system is being broken down into individual company’s online applications, why not make the whole career fair online. 
Yet for those students who don’t necessarily look good on paper, this digital shift may not allow them the opportunity to shine in person. This may also be a problem for those who wish to switch career paths and whose skills go beyond “good problem solving and synergy” which can be easily characterized in a check-the-box style. 
While the digital career fair offers an excellent second route, traditional career fairs should not disappear. Though many students may not gain anything from the TOC or EOC, the value of person-to-person connections should not be forgotten.

Newly instated Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich resigned from his post last week as a result of controversy surrounding his anti-gay political beliefs. 
Eich was revealed to have contributed money to the Proposition 8 campaign in 2008 to ban same-sex marriage in California; this discovery spurred nationwide calls for his removal, including a direct censure by popular online dating service OkCupid — which featured a message to all of the website’s Mozilla Firefox users urging them to use a different browser. Clearly, these extensive efforts to tear down a homophobic CEO were effective. But were such efforts justified? 
On one hand, placement of discriminatory individuals in positions of power should absolutely be discouraged. There are many cases where the public has the right — and, arguably, the obligation — to criticize or boycott a company and its leadership. These cases include when CEOs use their companies as platforms to voice discriminatory beliefs, when they use company revenue to support bigoted policies, when they discriminate against employees, or when they market offensive products and censor tolerant ones. 
To name just a few examples, Chick-Fil-A has donated millions of company money to anti-gay organizations; Urban Outfitters pulled anti-Proposition 8 T-shirts from shelves and supported Rick Santorum’s 2012 presidential campaign; and the Salvation Army regularly lobbies for the federal implementation of anti-gay policies. Boycotting any one of these companies in response to its CEO’s bigotry — or demanding that CEO’s resignation — would be fully warranted. 
However, the case of Mozilla’s now-former CEO Eich is not so clear cut. Those condemning Eich likely knew nothing more about him than his prejudiced — and private — beliefs. They had no knowledge of his work history, business practices, or qualifications for the position. They operated instead on the conviction that, as a homophobe, Eich had to be shot down. 
Eich resigned due to public pressure before he was ever given a chance to prove his ability to operate effectively as a businessman. Chances are, Eich’s personal beliefs would have had a negligible effect on the operation of Mozilla — if that were the case, Eich’s personal beliefs would ultimately be irrelevant. The right to free speech extends even to those in positions of power, and as long as prejudiced CEOs do not take advantage of their power to promote discrimination, their personal beliefs should not be a point of discussion. 
The public should hesitate to denounce every powerful person who expresses an unsavory belief. They should check first to see if that opinion is actually impacting how that person does their job. If not, then one person’s opinion shouldn’t matter.

Aside from a little bit of mizzle — “rain in very fine drops,” according to this year’s Scotch’n’Soda musical The 25th Annual Putnam Country Spelling Bee — the sun shone bright on Carnegie Mellon’s centennial Carnival celebration, which proved to be one of the most satisfying Carnivals in a long time. 
Carnival’s standard fare was all solid this year, some of the events even taking things up a notch in honor of the centennial. The comedy show with Hannibal Buress and Tig Notaro, which you can read about on page B5, was a resounding success; Buress, currently one of America’s most sought-after comedians, seemed like he might be out of place at a school full of “socially awkward teenagers,” as he called the student body, but he played off of that stereotype to produce some amazing ad lib. 
The Scotch’n’Soda production was also successful, and President Subra Suresh attended for the dinner theater gala performance in honor of the organization’s 75th year. Sweepstakes was more exciting — and well-attended —  than ever, although some nasty crashes left some people injured, one instance leaving a driver in the hospital. While Mac Miller was a predictable disappointment, Icona Pop delivered a fantastic performance.
The Carnival Committee brought back some age-old but long-forgotten traditions for the centennial, and while some of them were fairly entertaining — everyone seemed to like the plank jousting over a mud pit — they were not advertised well to the current student body. Not many of the centennial events were made clear to current students and were thus not very well attended. If the committee brings these traditions back in subsequent years, increased advertising and awareness of these events would serve to make them more successful continued traditions.
Booth was a huge improvement from last year, when Midway’s opening ceremony yielded only a smattering of unfinished and disappointing structures. Granted, the weather during build and move-on last year was less than preferable, but SigEp’s Lord of the Rings booth and TSA’s Miyazaki film booth were above and beyond anything from last year.
Overall, the centennial Carnival was an exciting celebration of Carnegie Mellon and the brilliant things our university’s students can accomplish.

The Tartan had a great time at Carnival this weekend! So we asked, "what would you like to see at the 101st Carnival?"

Janet Mock, an outspoken transgender woman who doesn’t like being labeled an activist or even an advocate, came to Carnegie Mellon’s campus last week. 
Mock spoke about her childhood growing up as a lower-class, black trans woman, about being full of yourself, and about her intersecting identities. The room was completely filled, and people asked valid, interesting questions that she seemed to enjoy answering.
It is so important that we bring more people like Janet Mock here to the Carnegie Mellon campus. She addressed very valid fears and concerns, as well as goals and ambitions, that many here at Carnegie Mellon have, and the talk provided people with a safe space to talk about crucial issues of race, class, sexuality, and gender.
The atmosphere felt safe and the discourse was engaging. My question, though, is why we don’t have more events and places like this on campus. We have groups where people of a certain identity can go to feel safe or engage in relevant discussion, such as ALLIES, SPIRIT, or ASA, but no outlet for similar discourse about intersecting issues to take place, and nowhere for people to realize — for example — how different it is to be trans and black, rather than trans and white, and where specifically that difference lies.
Especially at a place like Carnegie Mellon, we can often get caught up in our own insulated Pittsburgh or campus bubble that we forget the outside world, as well as the way in which our intersecting identities can affect the way we view the outside world. Conversation concerning intersecting identities would help people interested in learning more about these issues to be able to hear directly from people who have experienced some of those intersecting identities. It would also help create a larger number of safe spaces on campus where people can talk about such issues freely.
Some will argue that we don’t need spaces like this specifically carved out. They will argue that such discussion will happen without having to force it or plan events like Mock’s talk to facilitate it. I will argue instead that visibility and publicity are important, maybe just as important as the existence of events like Mock’s talk. 
If such events happen and no one is aware of them, what good does that do to either the campus community or the discussion itself? Visibility helps people realize that they are not alone in what they’re going through, if nothing else. 
Public events also publicize that these issues exist, and that these issues matter, and that’s just at the tip of the iceberg when considering the possibilities of making such discussion accessible to the larger campus community.
Mock advocated being full of yourself in her talk. As one of the moderators put it, “No one else is going to be full of you.” That’s advice that we should embrace in a society that tries to put people down based on their self-identified gender or their skin color — be full of yourself — you and your intersecting identities — because no one else will be.
