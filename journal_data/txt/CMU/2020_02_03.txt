On Friday, the Carnegie Mellon University Men’s Basketball Team traveled to New York City to take on the New York University Violets.
The first half was tightly contested, with the Tartans and the Violets staying within three points of each other until a layup by senior Trent Suddeth, assisted by senior Colin McNeil, gave the Tartans a five-point lead. With just over seven and a half minutes left of the first half, the score read 28-23.
Although a layup from New York University closed the gap to 28-25, a corresponding layup from Carnegie Mellon University senior Zach Howarth, with the assist coming once again from McNeil, re-established the margin of the Tartans’ lead just six seconds later. Capitalizing off a foul by the Violets, Howarth then made a free throw.
Shortly thereafter, Suddeth, once again assisted by McNeil, made another layup, expanding Carnegie Mellon University’s lead to eight points. With the score reading 33-25, the Tartans forced New York University to call a 30-second timeout with just over six and a half minutes to play in the first half.
A free throw made by the Violets after the timeout narrowed the margin by one point, but another layup by Suddeth put the Tartans ahead by nine points. Although New York University responded with a layup of their own, two free throws successfully made by Carnegie Mellon University senior Cooper Williams maintained the degree of advantage the Tartans had.
The score stayed locked at 37-28 in Carnegie Mellon University’s favor for over two minutes. A free throw made by the Violets brought the score to 37-29, where it stayed for nearly another two minutes. With just over a minute and a half left on the clock, a layup by junior Ethan Miller increased the Tartans’ lead to 39-29. A layup by Howarth in the last five seconds of the first half of the game ensured the 10-point lead would carry over into the next half.
With the commencement of the second half, New York University sought to mitigate the gap in the score, but the Tartan defense held strong, allowing only a single point to slip through to their opponents. A three-point jump-shot by Howarth then extended Carnegie Mellon University’s lead to 50-39 with just under 18 minutes to play. 
However, the Violets fought back. Taking advantage of a few jump-shots and free throws, they brought the scoreline to 50-46 — just four points shy of the Carnegie Mellon University team. Although New York University attempted to keep up the momentum, strong defensive work by the Tartans prevented further shortening of the score difference.
At this, New York University called for their first team timeout. This seemed to benefit their attacking strategy, and points were traded between the two teams, with the margin remaining at around four points, until a jump-shot made by the Violets shortened the gap to 56-54. With just two points separating the teams and just over 11 minutes of playing time left, the game began to heat up.
Both teams traded points, but the Tartans were unsuccessful in holding off the Violets, and with nine minutes on the clock, a New York University layup brought the Violets level with the Tartans, at 58-58. After a free throw by McNeil, Carnegie Mellon University used their first team timeout.
The Tartans’ timeout seemed to effectively stop New York University’s momentum, and a layup by Howarth along with a dunk by McNeil raised the scoreline to 63-58, re-opening up a five-point gap and forcing the Violets to call their second team timeout with just under eight minutes left in the second half.
With a layup and two free throws made by Suddeth, along with a three-point jump-shot by Miller and a layup by Howarth, the Tartans found themselves in good shape heading into the final stretch of the game. With just over six minutes remaining in the second playing period, the score read 72-58 in Carnegie Mellon University’s favor. With the Tartans leading by 14 points, New York University were prompted to call their third team timeout.
The timeout seemed to be effective for the Violets, and a series of layups and free throws put New York University at 72-66. However, the Tartans quickly stifled the Violets’ progress, limiting the margin back to an eight-point difference. A couple of well-planned stratagems, along with a couple of layups, put the Carnegie Mellon University team in the lead by 13 points, the score reading 80-67 with two minutes left to play. 
Although New York University put in their best effort to stop the Tartans’ momentum, utilizing their final team timeout, free throws courtesy of junior Daniel Weiss, along with McNeil and Howarth, made sure that the score stayed as is.
Though the Violets managed to score two free-throws in the last 15 seconds of the entire game, it was still not enough to overcome the gap between the scores. The game ended with the Tartans presenting a 13-point lead, the final scoreboard reading 84-71 in favor of the Carnegie Mellon University men.
Overall, the Tartans performed quite well, having only nine turnovers — half of their opponents’ numbers — with 25 points scored off of turnovers compared to the Violets’ seven. In terms of assists, the Carnegie Mellon University men also led, with 22 compared to New York University’s 8.
Of the 22 assists, 17 came from Colin McNeil. This statistic means that McNeil has broken the single-game school assist record and tied the University Athletic Association (UAA) single-game assist record. Now, he needs just 4 more assists to break the decades old single season assist record, and 33 more to become the Carnegie Mellon Men’s Basketball Program’s career leader.
The Tartans now look to face New York University at home on Friday, Feb. 7.

Last week, retired NBA star Kobe Bryant died in a helicopter crash at the age of 41. Bryant’s daughter Gianna, age 13, also died in the crash. The tragedy also claimed the lives of seven others, including the pilot.
Over the past week, tributes to Bryant have come from across the NBA. The first night of NBA games after his passing saw teams taking a shot clock violation, 24 seconds, and their opponents taking an eight second backcourt violation. One night, the Lakers left shirts on each seat with Kobe’s numbers, 8 and 24, and left roses on seats where Kobe and Gianna Bryant previously sat.
In interviews, NBA players expressed their sorrow at Bryant’s passing. Numerous players posted their condolences to Twitter or Instagram. Many discussed the impact Bryant has had on the game from his time on the court, reaching numerous milestones, to his time after retirement, acting as a mentor to many of the young stars in the league.
Early in Bryant’s career, he faced an allegation of sexual assault. The case was settled out of court, and Bryant wrote a letter as part of the settlement deal. Since then, Bryant has not faced other allegations of sexual misconduct.
The day before Bryant’s death, LeBron James passed his career point total, and on Saturday, James finally played his first game since Bryant’s death. In a speech to the crowd before the game, James said, “Kobe’s a brother to me. From the time I was in high school, watching him from afar to getting in this league at 18, watching him up close. All the battles we had throughout my career. The one thing that we always shared was that determination to just always want to win and just want to be great.”
Kobe Bryant’s legacy as an NBA star is similar to that of many other famed players, like Michael Jordan, where their on-court reputation and importance to the sport outweigh any off-court issues they may have had. Bryant won one MVP award, and averaged 25 points a game, 5 rebounds a game, and 5 assists a game over the course of his career. He helped the Lakers win 5 NBA championships.

This is Penalty Shouts, The Tartan’s sports column inspired by the The New Yorker’s column Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled column will focus on anything and everything funny in the sports world that is deserving of our comedic attention. 
Late in January, I interviewed some old geezers at the National Baseball Hall of Fame to hear about the recent election, which saw Derek Jeter and Larry Walker elected to the Hall. 
Two additional people were  chosen by the official baseball league old-persons committee. However, no one remembers who they are.
The consensus across the voting members of the old geezers, also known as the Baseball Writers’ Association of America, was that Derek Jeter was an obvious first ballot HOF’er. “He didn’t shoot dope, and he played the game like it was supposed to be played. Not to mention, he could definitely rub tar on my bat,” they said in a press statement.
In light of Curt “bush-league play” Schilling missing out on the Hall of Fame once again, the writers only had one thing to say: “Good.”
Other people that were not to be elected this year include cheaters Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens. “These fools will never, ever be in the Hall of Fame because they tried cheating and got caught,” the Writers’ Association said. 
In light of the statement, Both Bonds and Clemens responded by saying that their success was a function of their baseball skills, not their steroid use. “We still have to play the game, right? Our talent was obvious, but our careers were extended by the steroids. Even without the steroids, we would still likely be in the Hall of Fame,” Bonds and Clemens said. Individually, Bonds wrote, “I just wanted to hit 756 home runs. I never meant for it to go any farther.”
At the very end of the election, the geezers doffed their robes and returned to their wheelchairs. They exited their cult hall and left the candles burning.
Unfortunately, one of the candles fell over and lit the building on fire. Everyone escaped unscathed, except for Chone Figgins. Figgins, who was invited to attend the election as a player’s representative, earned zero votes from the committee, and when he found out, he went to the bathroom. Definitely not to cry.
All of the writers laughed their throaty laughs. It made Figgins feel bad.
So he went to the bathroom, and the writers ended the election. They sent out the white smoke to announce a new Hall of Fame member. Then, they left, the candle fell, and Chone Figgins was trapped.
He had to jump out of the bathroom window, which was on the first floor, but on the way, he broke a nail. Everyone is extremely sad for Figgins. Hopefully, he’ll be able to recover someday.

These days, we often take the accessibility of sports broadcasts for granted. As such, it’s rather rare for the vast majority of the spectators to be fully aware of the technological innovations taking place to enhance the game’s experience. Often, the adjustments resulting from these are, in the grand scope of things, rather small, but the combination of ideas and fine-tuning mean that today’s viewing experience is leaps and bounds beyond that of just a few years ago.
DreamlandXR is a festival that celebrates and recognizes the latest innovations in immersive technology, music, and eSports. Held in Las Vegas, it’s a chance for developers and consumers across industries to convene and confer. One of the accolades that DreamlandXR presents is the Best Sports Project Award. This year, beating out American industry giants NBA and WWE, Frankfurt-based Deutsche Fußball Liga received the prize.
The subsidiary of DFL – Fußballverband, the DFL is wholly responsible for the operating business of the Ligaverband, which includes the German Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga. Recently, the DFL has been working closely with Vodafone, in partnership with immersiv.io, to develop a lean-forward experience for spectators.
The concept of a lean-forward experience is not a new one. Popularized near the beginning of the last decade, it’s part of the concept that the media can either have receivers actively interacting and controlling the flow of information — thereby leaning forward — or have the audience passively receiving information without active involvement — a lean-back experience.
Since its conception, soccer, along with most, if not all, other sports, have been almost exclusively lean-back experiences. The DFL is changing this. With immersiv.io’s  specific specialization in augmented reality for sports and the unmatched speed of the 5G mobile network, the DFL and Vodafone developed a real-time smartphone app for 5G-compatible devices.
The first trial of the app, conducted back in September of last year, was a live demonstration of its capabilities during a Bundesliga match between VFL Wolfsburg and TSG Hoffenheim at the Volkswagen Arena. The spectators who took part in the trial received real-time statistics, among which included players’ individual match values, player speed, and expected goal analyses.
In doing this, the DFL seeks to connect fans’ unique stadium experiences with the now-commonplace flow of digital information. According to the DFL Group’s Executive Vice President of Digital Innovations, Andreas Heyden, “the Bundesliga continues to pioneer new innovations. Powered by 5G technology, together with our clubs, we will soon be able to provide real-time data and expand the stadium experience with the help of augmented reality.”
“This award marks yet another milestone for the investment we are making in this area, recognition of the quality and progress we have achieved with our partners and further reason why we’re considered one of the leading sports brands by the tech industry — football’s innovation leader.”
The DFL has expanded its prospects for innovation to media output as well, having experimented with broadcasting Bundesliga fixtures in a 9:16 format alongside its traditional 16:9 ratio scarcely two months ago. This change in proportion allows for smartphone users to view the match in portrait mode if they so wish. Although a relatively small change that may not significantly enhance the viewing experience for a majority of the audience, the accommodating nature of this development is still commendable.
All in all, innovation in the broadcast and presentation of sports, particularly innovations that involve enhancing the experience of the audience in creative, original ways, are integral to the overall progress of the sport and the industry. It is hopeful that more leagues and operations will follow in the DFL’s example in developing contemporary solutions to keep pace with and to take full advantage of contemporary advancements in technology.

It is no secret that almost 60 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, structural racism is still a prevailing issue of our time. Even if segregation and racial discrimination laws are no longer explicit in their wording, their impact can be felt today, even if it is not always easy to see.
This is where EarthTime comes in. EarthTime, an interactive mapping software developed by Carnegie Mellon’s Community Robotics, Education and Technology Empowerment (CREATE) Lab, has collected huge amounts of data obtained from the census, NASA, the UN, university research, and more. The software collates the data into layers that can be displayed geographically over time for a powerful visual effect.
Anne Wright, Director of Operations at CREATE, leads the local demographic mapping work for EarthTime and works with local organizations on a variety of missions. She recently visited Davos, Switzerland to give a talk at the 2020 World Economic Forum pertaining to Pittsburgh’s housing issues and population displacement, using EarthTime to show them in their historical context.
“EarthTime is understanding how our world is changing in various ways … Mostly it involves a combination of exploring data sets to understand what is and has been, and what stories can be illustrated in a way that can help people understand the context and the history,” Wright said in an interview with The Tartan.
Pittsburgh, like many major cities in America, has a history of redlining, the racist banking practice of offering housing loans based on where the applicant lived. Redlining thus ensured that communities of color could not obtain housing loans, and prevented them from moving out of their neighborhood. Even though this practice has been banned since the Fair Housing Act of 1968, segregating African-Americans and people of color into discrete communities is a hard process to undo. 
“Pittsburgh has a very high degree of racial segregation to this day. [The racial demographic] borders correspond directly to the historical borders of the redlining maps. The main difference between Pittsburgh and Milwaukee [one of the most racially segregated cities in the country] is that Milwaukee has one big predominantly African American area with fuzzier edges, while Pittsburgh has a number of areas with sharper edges,” Wright said.
A key factor preserving the effects of redlining is school districts. Since public education funding is drawn from property taxes in the school district, the separation of African American communities from white communities, compounded with historical impoverishment, results in predominantly African American school districts having less funding per student than predominantly white school districts. In Pittsburgh, this can be seen rather easily, as there are incredibly sharp gradations in housing value when crossing from one school district to another.
“The school district boundaries in Western Pennsylvania are among the most segregated in the country … If you look at those boundaries, they’re also significant boundaries with respect to housing values, race, income, employment, you name it,” Wright said. 
Another factor reproducing the effect of redlining is gentrification; several of these historically African American neighborhoods are being faced with wealthier, white people moving in. This results in property value increases (meaning rent increases), and eventual displacement to the outer suburbs.
“Some of [the displacement] is people moving further out into the county … [Recently] there is a significant increase in the African American population in the East Hills. One of the things I did not understand at the beginning of this is that not only are the public transportation options higher inside of Pittsburgh but so are the rights; there are more protected classes, the commission on human relations that does fair housing enforcement. These are not available outside of Pittsburgh in the same way, so when the people are displaced … they end up further out. They are potentially more vulnerable and have fewer opportunities for transit to work, school, childcare and so on,” Wright said.
“We have been working with organizations that are trying to support vulnerable populations, especially African Americans who are vulnerable to displacement from increased rents,”  she continued. “We are trying to understand from [these organizations] what are the things that people in power do not understand that they need to understand so that we can bring those stories to them.”
EarthTime’s ability to explain more recent trends is limited by its data sets. “We don’t have new block-level data until the 2020 census comes out,” Wright explained. “The American Community Survey data, which is what we have that is more recent, uses 5-year averages released yearly, so, for instance, I can see that there are new apartments being built, but I will not see on the block-level that folks are there until the 2020 census.”
Wright can see where public housing has been closed or privatized and replaced with profit-driven housing pushing out people of color, such as in the East Liberty negihborhood. With more data from the 2020 census, EarthTime will be able to visualize what might happen next to these housing communities.

Legends from around the world feature characters whose sadness turns their hair grey overnight. Bizarre as they appear to be, those stories actually include an element of truth. Researchers at Harvard University confirmed that stress can indeed lead to grey hair and discovered the reasons behind it. 
In a study published in Nature, the authors found that the nerve cells involved in the fight-or-flight response cause permanent damage to the pigment-regenerating stem cells in hair follicles in mice. This finding advances our understanding of how stress impacts the hair, moving researchers one step closer to blocking its negative effects.
To discover the cause of grey hair, researchers tested and eliminated different possible sources. They initially hypothesized immune attacks on pigment-producing cells were the cause, but mice without immune cells were still susceptible to grey hair. 
They proceeded to other theories such as cortisol, the hormone elevated by stress. The theory of cortisol was disproved by further experiments on mice. After the mice lost their abilities to produce cortisol, they could still grow grey hairs under stress.
After several rounds of the process of elimination, the scientists landed on the sympathetic nerve system, which is responsible for the body's fight-or-flight response, as the culprit. Sympathetic nerves branch out into every hair follicle on the skin. When stressed, the nerves will release chemicals that are taken up by nearby stem cells, activating them into pigment-generating cells used to color the hair. An excess amount of pigment-generating cells will be activated when under stress, and the pigment reservoirs of these cells will be prematurely depleted. Once depleted, there are no longer cells that can color one’s hair.
This finding helps scientists move towards moderating or blocking the effects of stress. In stressful environments, people are going to get grey hair at an earlier age. Currently, there are over 1.5 million posts with the hashtag #Greyhair on Instagram, and research in 2018 shows that 32 percent of British women under the age of 30 have already started to go grey. Indeed, grey hair is beginning to impact even those in their 20s. Even though factors like nutrition, medication, and genetics also play essential roles in greying hair, stress might have the greatest impact overall.
The relationship between stress, hair, and stem cells could also lead to new discoveries about how stress affects organ functions and blood vessels in comparison to stem cells. Scientists across many disciplines hope to ultimately exploit this relationship to find a way to control stem cells.

Yale researchers discovered that ketogenic (keto) diets result in health benefits in the short term. However, being on a keto diet for longer than roughly a week negatively impacts health. In a study on mice published in Nature Metabolism, researchers found that participating in a keto diet for a short period of time lowers diabetes risk and inflammation. This mouse study also serves as an integral first step toward initiating human clinical trials.
A keto diet derives 99% of calories from fat and protein, with the remaining 1% coming from carbohydrates. Celebrities such as LeBron James, Kim Kardashian, and Gwyneth Paltrow have praised the keto diet as an effective diet to lose weight. Due to their endorsements of the diet, it has enjoyed a recent spike in popularity.
The Yale researchers discovered that the keto diet’s impact – positive and negative – is primarily due to immune cells known as gamma delta T cells. These T cells are tissue-protective cells responsible for lowering the risk of diabetes and inflammation. 
Lead author Vishwa Deep Dixit from the Yale School of Medicine explained that a keto diet effectively manipulates the body into burning fat. Because the diet has a very low carbohydrate content, one’s glucose level is greatly reduced, tricking the body into acting like it’s in the midst of starvation. Thus, the body switches its primary fuel source to fats rather than carbohydrates. Chemicals known as ketone bodies are yielded from this process. As ketone bodies are burned, tissue-protective gamma delta T cells proliferate in the body. According to Dixit, a keto diet results in an overall reduction in diabetes risk and inflammation, thereby improving metabolism. Inflammation and blood sugar levels in mice were reduced after being on the keto diet for a week. 
Researchers observed that, while the body is in a starvation state, fat breakdown and fat storage both occur. Dixit said mice on the keto diet for longer than a week consumed more fat than they were able to burn and developed obesity and diabetes. 
“They lose the protective gamma delta T cells in the fat,” remarked Dixit in a press release. “Before such a diet can be prescribed, a large clinical trial in controlled conditions is necessary to understand the mechanism behind metabolic and immunological benefits or any potential harm to individuals who are overweight and prediabetic.”
Emily Goldberg, postdoctoral fellow in comparative medicine at Yale, was the scientist who discerned that the keto diet results in a proliferation of gamma delta T cells in mice. Goldberg wrote, “Our findings highlight the interplay between metabolism and the immune system, and how it coordinates maintenance of healthy tissue function.”
Long-term human clinical studies are necessary to confirm the keto diet’s health benefits. With about 84 million prediabetic American adults according to the Centers for Disease Control, this research could be critical to reducing the risk of many chronic illnesses, including stroke, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.

I used to listen to music in the way a lot of people do: I had 10-15 songs that I played repeatedly, which cycled through as songs were forgotten and new ones discovered. Sure, I would listen to a new album here and there or indulge myself in some throwbacks from my childhood, but for the most part, I listened to the same songs. This continued until 2018, when I decided to start listening to current releases as a way to expand my musical knowledge and enjoyment. I figured that there was so much music that I could experience and appreciate, and something about the concept of an album — a dynamic artistic expression packaged up into a cover with a name and subsequently mass distributed — fascinated me.
I followed through with this plan, but about halfway through it, I got a more ambitious idea: Why not apply this on a larger scale? I imagined how much music I could discover from before I was even born. I decided to dedicate 2019 to listening to 100 albums from each decade starting with the 1950s. My goal was to expand my musical knowledge, but what I discovered was something much bigger and much more important than that.
I knew I needed some kind of structure for this endeavor. I didn’t want to just pick random albums for each decade. Instead, I started following “Top 100” lists for each decade. I would listen to these in chronological order, with 2 months dedicated to each decade. I also knew that this would mean something significant: I was going to be listening to a good deal of music I didn’t like. Nonetheless, I wanted to grasp the full picture.
It was a frigid New Years Eve, in my living room in the dead of night, when I embarked on my musical journey. There I was, sitting in my living room, with the dulcet tones of Richie Valens softly cooing in my ears. It was then that I realized: this was going to take effort. This realization became more and more clear to me over the following month, as I was listening to jazz album after jazz album, with seemingly so little perceptible variation in style. I had to constantly remind myself that I couldn’t let this be a passive process. I had to focus on what I was hearing and engage with it. There were many a time when I would drift away dreaming of Led Zeppelin while Miles Davis’ trumpet yelled at me for it in my headphones. I realized it would take effort, and patience. This effort and patience turned out to be the biggest reward of the experience.
I transitioned into the 60s in March, as the weather was beginning to thaw, which I found to be a sort of metaphor for coming out of the relatively monotonous and unadventurous 50s. As I became more comfortable with this new pace of listening, I found certain pockets of my routine that would be associated with new albums: walks to school, walks to work, my art class, weekend mornings, long drives. I enriched these daily, sometimes boring parts of my life by experiencing a new song, album, or artist during them. I began to discover the magic of what I was doing. I began to realize that I could pick a song or album from my ongoing playlists and remember where I was when I was listening to it, and even sometimes my thoughts at the time. As I traveled into the 70s and simultaneously the end of my high school career, I developed a sense of nostalgia about the music I was listening to: certain songs and artists evoked a memory or a feeling that I had while listening to them. The decades became deeply-embedded representations of different phases of the year: the cold and cozy winter for the 50s, the warm and gentle spring in the 70s, and then the hot and bright summer in the 80s. The pop, dance, funk, and (finally!) hip-hop of the decade became the soundtrack for sunburns, salty hair, warm nights and sunny days.
It was also at the end of this decade that my family drove down to Pittsburgh to drop me off here at Carnegie Mellon. I was immersed very suddenly in an entirely new environment, and the music I listened to reflected this. Following the blissful 80s I plunged into the grimy, heavy grunge that characterized much of 90s music. These albums and artists evoke memories of the cloudy and rainy fall days, along with many of the “firsts” of my college experience. They bring about a sense of rawness that comes from the music itself as well as the context in which I was listening to it, as I was adapting to my new environment. The stark contrast from the 80s was fitting with the daunting change that I underwent in that period.
Entering the 2000s in November felt like entering the home stretch, and it was akin to what I was feeling about the first semester. The anticipation created by entering the current millennium of music corresponded to my anticipation of going home for Thanksgiving. The music was becoming more familiar, and it felt as though I was coming out of the strange dream of the 90s, my most unfamiliar decade of music. I was listening to songs and albums that I remember playing on the radio or in my headphones so many years ago, but also seemingly just yesterday. The recognition provided a sense of comfort, of control, of return. In a way this feeling was a predecessor to that of going home later that month, feeling like I was returning back to the familiar after a long and strange dream, a dreamless sleep.
Going into this musical journey, I expected something quite different from what I got. I knew certain things would happen: I knew I’d experience the changing of music, and the rise and fall of big names in recent musical history. I did experience these things, but I also found a deeper meaning to music and life in general. The experience taught me a lot about what makes something memorable, such as providing yourself with new stimuli when you can rather than going through the same motions repeatedly, a trap that is especially common among college students. It also taught me much about patience — the value of indulging in something, even if you suspect you won’t like it, and even if you don’t like it. Music provides a safe way to step out of your comfort zone and try to understand something you dislike. You might learn to appreciate it, or even grow a fondness for it. An album might have 11 songs that make your ears bleed, but that one song you save to your library can become a marker for valuable memories, and that is a great metaphor for life.

"When I was younger, I was born in the wrong body, which means that I am transgender."
Dutch YouTuber Nikkie de Jager, popularly known as NikkieTutorials, publicly posted a video titled "I'm Coming Out." Her video quickly went viral globally, spreading from The Ellen Show in the U.S. to the news on Dutch television. Her coming out also elicited emails “from lawmakers that got inspired to change the world.” In just over 17 minutes, de Jager managed to inspire other “little Nikkies” finding their places in the world, along with parents supporting children who could relate to her story, and broadening the discussion of transgender rights.
Unfortunately, she did not come out completely on her own terms. After she had been blackmailed by someone who threatened to “’leak’ [her] story to the press,” she decided to take control over her story by coming out herself “under my conditions.” In a follow-up video, de Jager urged the public to leave the rest to the officials. She claims that she doesn’t wish the experience of being blackmailed on anyone, and giving the blackmailer public exposure would cause her to stoop to the level of her perpetrator.
The follow-up also indirectly addresses the extended tensions between de Jager and the cosmetic brand Too Faced that dates back to 2016. Lisa Blandino, who is known by the name Dani California on Instagram and is the sister of Too Faced’s CEO, changed her Instagram bio to read “Transgender huh? That’s not the only thing she’s been LYING [sic] about.” She quickly changed her bio to read “Let’s be clear, I love trans people & dislike anyone who lies to hurt others! Period!” Although she has been cut off from the company, this incident further reinforces the problematic idea that transgender people are inauthentic or a threat. This kind of rhetoric can be found in more common comments about how transgender women are deceiving straight cisgender men, to the so-called trans panic defense.
Her coming out was, of course, an act of courage. However, in her case, her coming out was her taking agency over her own identity. In 2015, she skyrocketed to popularity in the beauty community with her video “The Power of Makeup.” In the video, she transforms half of her face with her usual style of makeup while leaving the other half natural. Through the process, she sends the message that she is the same regardless of how she chooses to express herself. She acknowledges that makeup may be used to fit societal expectations or to hide one’s insecurities, but she sees it as an art form that provides her agency over her self-expression. Her message now is an extension of her message then: she should have control over how she wants to write her story, just as anybody else should for theirs.

This review contains some spoilers for the movie.
There are plenty of reasons not to watch this Scorsese crime drama. It’s three and a half hours long (just ahead of Titanic by 15 minutes), most of which is just talking, and has a plot revolving around more names than the Pentagon Papers. For the viewer who’d rather relish the chance to turn off their brain, I hate to break it to you, this film may not be for you. The constant over-the-shoulder shots and harmonica theme would probably bore you faster than the line at La Prima.
Nevertheless, there are several reasons why you should certainly give The Irishman a try, aside from the fact that it has ten nominations at this year’s Academy Awards. Given a chance, the film’s plot, characterization, and even its cinematographic decisions will certainly leave a permanent impression in your mind. However, remember that it is three and a half hours long, so I’d highly recommend creating a personal agenda of intermissions. (Preferably an ice cream break as well — you’ll see why.)
Based on the book I Heard You Paint Houses by former prosecutor Charles Brandt, the story centers around Frank Sheeran, an Irish mafia hitman, and his alleged murder of union president Jimmy Hoffa. Before I go any further, “to paint houses” was a term used by the mafia to mean, well... to kill people by contract, comparing paint to the blood that would splatter against the walls. This phrase was usually followed by, “I also do my own carpentry,” meaning that the contracted killer’s jobs included getting rid of the bodies (and the weapons too). Even though this phrase itself is hardly mentioned in the film, it is important to know this term if you’d like to be able to keep up with the story. I digress.
Frank Sheeran, played by renowned actor Robert de Niro, begins as a World War II veteran and Pennsylvania truck driver, where he meets lawyer William Buffalino (Ray Romano) and mafia head Russell Buffalino (Joe Pesci) on a false accusation of company theft. Through these connections, he eventually crosses paths with Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) and begins a political career balanced with his contract killing.
Out of this all-star cast, Al Pacino certainly didn’t fail to bring his iconic on-screen charisma; he made me laugh more times in this film than he made me blush in The Godfather. Without a doubt, it was a breath of fresh air to see him back in a role where he gets to ‘play around’ with his character, adding vocal nuances and physical mannerisms that make his character memorable. Pacino brings his signature, flamboyant flavor of acting and blends it with the no-nonsense, never-wait-longer-than-ten-minutes personality of the real Jimmy Hoffa, topping it off with a voice that never made the word ‘solidarity’ sound better. By the way, this character loves ice cream; he enjoys 4 sundaes within the movie. The real Jimmy Hoffa was known to be a non-drinker and a non-smoker, but apparently loved his ice cream. The screenwriters and Pacino chose to use this as a recurring theme. Nevertheless, Pacino’s one-liners and wit, covered in a heap of situationally-appropriate cussing take the cake as his most memorable characteristic. The quote ”You always charge a guy with a gun! With a knife, you run away” will probably be forever associated with Pacino’s face, along with “say hello to my little friend” and “Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.”
On that note, another notable cast member Anna Paquin is cast in the role of Sheeran’s daughter Peggy, with the younger version played by Lucy Gallina. Many critics find her silence meaningful throughout the film, almost show-stealing worthy. Acting with her eyes most of the time, she conveys her own perspective on her father’s occupation and her silent negative judgment. Contrasting with Pacino’s flamboyance (with whom she shares great on-screen chemistry), Paquin’s method of acting fits her role perfectly and even surpasses the acting of many of the other cast members of The Irishman.
From a cinematographic point-of-view, The Irishman raised eyebrows with its use of computer aging in order to show the time progression of the central characters. While many found it distracting, I found it quite pleasing - it certainly removed the constraint of casting different actors to play the same character through different walks of life. In addition, the inclusion of vintage music, especially “In the Still of the Night” by the Five Satins, added a constant presence of warmth in a film filled with scenes of minimally embellished violence and subtle dramatic dialogue.
When I was finished with this three-and-a-half-hour long piece of cinema, I’ll admit that I was ready to give this a 4 out of 10, simply because it felt like the action was faltering and the plot increasingly difficult to follow. However, after a bit of journaling, some online research, and yes, some much-needed rewinds, I changed my mind. Now, I’d give this film an 8/10, for its acting and amazing technical work, and I’d tell you to keep an eye out for this piece of cinema at Sunday’s Academy Awards.

The Light in the Piazza by Adam Guetteld. Directed by Seamus Ricci and conducted by Christopher Larkin. A truly beautiful piece of art. Presented in the Chosky Theater in the Purnell Center.
The story follows a young American girl named Clara and her mother Margaret on their trip around Italy in the 1950s. On the trip, Clara falls in love with an Italian man, and even though there is a language and cultural barrier, nothing can stop them from being together.
The students of the School of Music did a wonderful job bringing these characters to life. Both casts created unique atmospheres and relationships to tell the story. Each actor came into their own for their respective roles. It was evident from watching that each individual on stage had unique ideas surrounding their character and motivations. Each student had such a beautiful and powerful voice and presence that captured the individuality of the roles onstage and their own interpretations of said characters.
As an audience member, it was clear that the actors had worked closely together on how they would be interacting onstage. Despite a large portion of the cast being the same on all nights, there was a cohesion among the ensemble as a whole. I recognize that each show would be different due to the difference in cast members. Despite the change in people, it seemed that all members worked together to figure out their character dynamics with their respective cast members.
It was a pleasure getting to witness how dedicated and imaginative each of these students are in performing this type of show such. The intense, detailed work that had been done prior to the show was highlighted throughout all four performances. Each audience recognized the extreme effort taken to perform such an intense show, and lauded the cast highly with multiple standing ovations.
Overall, the show was an incredible success, with many elegant costumes and quite a few costume changes, an imaginative set design with suspended furniture, gorgeous singing, a fantastic instrumental score, and an ensemble with enormous love for performance, pouring their hearts into their work.

Blair Underwood was forced to leave Carnegie Mellon halfway through his junior year for financial reasons, but just two years later he was starring on L.A. Law, one of the biggest shows on television.
Underwood, soon to co-star in the Netflix series Self Made, has played a wide array of characters, with many spotlighting African Americans in roles where they have been historically underrepresented. Now, he’s starring on Broadway as Captain Davenport in A Soldier’s Play, which revolves around the murder of an African-American sergeant on a Louisiana army base in 1944. Davenport investigates the case, battling discrimination by white officers, even as he unearths the bitter rivalries among the black soldiers.
Underwood deftly switches between charisma, stoicism, and exasperation at an unfair system. Despite years of TV stardom, it’s clear Underwood still loves theater, describing the “symbiotic relationship” between actor and audience as “riding a wave, every night” in a phone interview with The Tartan: “As actors, at the end of the day we’re storytellers.”
Growing up in a military family, you moved a lot. Did having to constantly adapt to new places, new cultures, and new people inform you as an actor?
Growing up like that, you either stick to yourself or you learn how to adapt and assimilate, not to the point of losing yourself, but to connect and be absorbed into a school, a community, a church, whatever else. That’s very much the life of an actor—it’s a very nomadic lifestyle, you have to go shoot on location or do a play. You’re constantly pulling up roots and putting them down somewhere else.
Has playing Captain Davenport helped you better understand what your father went through as an African American Army officer?
Any character you play, you put their skin on. You take their thoughts and their dreams, and every night for two hours you take that journey. Of course, this play is set in the ‘40s, my dad was there in the ‘60s and ‘70s, but there are a lot of similarities in terms of being underestimated, being “tolerated” by some who may not want your presence there, yet you still forge forward with excellence as your beacon. Experiencing that journey every night has given me a broader understanding of his career.
What did you feel like you got out of Carnegie Mellon while you were here?
What I learned was process, how to build a character. We learned everything you could want to learn really. It was all-consuming, comprehensive, I loved getting in the trenches and being challenged like that. They expect a lot of you, which I’m grateful for.
What did it mean to you that the school later offered you the opportunity to complete your degree?
It meant a lot to me. I never like to start something and not finish it, so to be able to come back and actually graduate and get my diploma was important. I’m a very practical person, and pragmatic, so I knew it was a win-win situation. At the time I was on the number one drama on television, L.A. Law, so it wasn’t a bad thing for the school to say “that kid on T.V. came from here.”
They let me use those three years that I’d been out in the world as “real-life” work credit. I had to write a final thesis, “The Business of Show.” At that time, we learned everything we could about the craft, nothing about even auditioning or getting a job, much less building and maintaining a career. I know they’ve remedied that since, to help people make the transition from a university to the business.
This is your first time back on Broadway since playing Stanley in A Streetcar Named Desire. Is there a noticeable difference between acting on a Broadway stage versus elsewhere?
The experience between the actors on stage and the audience is the same wherever you go. That said, what is unique and incredibly special about Broadway is the community of Broadway shows and actors. Every time a show opens, all the other 40 houses will send a fax or an email of a congratulatory wish where the whole cast signs it. The night we opened we had 40 different pages taped all over the doors from the different shows, so there is a sense of community, which is very nice.
And the fact that it is Broadway, it is the epitome of our theatrical experience in this country. The stakes are higher on every level: tickets cost more, productions cost more, reviews carry more weight, expectations are much higher. It makes it much more electric and exciting. 
You’re one of the two veterans in the cast, alongside David Alan Grier. Do you try to mentor the younger actors?
I try to lead by example, I think you can make an impact by just how you present yourself. If somebody asks me questions we’ll have a conversation, if they want my advice I’d freely give it. I’ve been in the game for a long time, and if I see a place where I can drop a seed here and there, I’ll do so.

Next Sunday is the 92nd Academy Awards, where Hollywood will christen the “best” films, performances, and technical work of 2019. It seems that every year there is something wrong with the Oscars: the nominees are too white, the host is too controversial, or the actual announcement of Best Picture is wrong (you know what I’m talking about).
The annual outrage and disappointment is understandable, or rather, expected. There are hundreds of films that get made and released each year, and the Oscars can’t (and won’t) honor them all – it’s just impossible for one person to watch all the good films (and it’s a great thing that there are so many great movies being made right now). Maybe your favorite film of the year was snubbed for one reason or another, or the performance that touched you the most was left off the list, but there’s nothing we can do about that.
Some ask, “Why do the Oscars matter?” Well, the fact that we ask that question just feeds into its continued importance. The Oscars matter because their prestige carries weight in the film industry – actors who can now be billed as “Academy Award winner” have clout, and the writers, directors, and producers that go home with the statuette gain power to influence what gets made. The Oscars are still the cultural touchstone of movies in America and around the world, and will remain so for a while.

Spoilers for The Good Place series finale to follow
I’m not usually someone who throws myself into TV shows, but The Good Place was something special, something I always looked forward to at the end of each week. Even during the ensemble’s lowest lows, there were always bright and funny moments that lifted my mood and brought a shared joy to the friends I watched with. The finale aired this past Thursday, and I don’t know what I was supposed to expect, but this … was not it.
The finality of the last episode really shocked me. While I could understand Michael Schur’s creative direction, it still left a bitter aftertaste, especially after his reliance on the cyclical nature of the plot for so long. What was meant to be a comedy show ended with me crying for more than half of the finale, which seemed like a kick when I was already down, considering I was already upset over having to say goodbye to the beloved show. There were definitely some funny moments, but it was mostly depressing to watch. Although the characters did enjoy their time in the real Good Place, it was unsatisfying that we never really got to see those happy moments. After all the characters had been through, the creators should have given us more time to celebrate, but they just breezed through and didn’t allow us to relish in the last few good memories Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, Jason, Michael, and Janet were able to make together.
The pacing was surprisingly good, but I hated watching the progression of events because I didn’t want the characters to go their separate ways. A group of friends who balanced each other out perfectly quickly dissolved before my eyes, and it was heartbreaking. Four seasons of them fighting, making up, struggling together, and laughing together were over.
What now?
Now that it’s over, my friends and I are on a quest to find a new show that brings the same palette of emotions. The first thing that came to mind, after seeing many ads for the recently-premiered second season of the show, was Miracle Worker. The first season, released last year, follows the lives of angels who work at a corporation run by a slacking, unmotivated God as they attempt to convince him not to destroy Earth and create a restaurant in its stead.
Miracle Workers is slowly filling the void left by The Good Place, but it won’t for long, as the first season is only seven episodes long, and the second season follows a new set of characters. I don’t want to compare the two in every aspect, but I definitely enjoy that Miracle Workers similarly follows an eclectic cast of misfit characters that have to come together and ultimately save humanity from an unjust “higher power” type system. The premise of switching the characters but keeping the cast is interesting. And the new Dark Ages setting for season two will be exciting, I’m a bit sad that we won’t be able to get a deeper read of the first season’s characters. Craig, Eliza, Sanjay, and God seem like very rich and fleshed out characters, and yet we’ll only have the chance to meet them for the seven episodes, and Craig and Eliza will have only 14 days to save the earth from destruction. And coming from a show like The Good Place, with four seasons of intensive character growth for all six main characters, it’s hard not to grasp for more information about these angels and their God.
We’re three episodes in, so here’s to the next four satisfying our cravings.

Welcome to Maddy's Monthly Meme Madness, where we take a look at the Top 5 most-liked memes on the Facebook group, Carnegie Mellon Memes for Spicy Teens, posted in the past month.
1) "Forbes Ave" by Shelley Kim (10/10)
“Only 90’s kids remember” culture honors turn-of-the-century landmarks like Rugrats and butterfly clips. However, let us not forget the pinnacle of the Carnegie Mellon experience up until the summer of 2019: the beloved Beep Boop.
2) "CIT protection" by Bethany Bauer (10/10)
This is one of very few coronavirus memes that is actually hilarious. Is the hermit engineer trope overplayed? Perhaps. But it’s nice to be able to laugh at a meme that unites us in this trying time.
3) "Costing an arm and a leg" by Wan Shen Lim (10/10)
In true Carnegie Mellon style, this high-quality meme brings out quantitative analysis to show the trajectory of our tuition. Although it has yet to cost an arm and a leg, the tuition cost is well on its way to costing a kidney.
4) "Office hours" by Pratham Gupta (9/10)
Approaching professors can be daunting in of itself. Not being able to reach someone is daunting. The two together create an unbearable concoction that can deter students from seeking academic help. Let’s hope that the new decade welcomes more access to academic guidance.
5) "Bear traps" by Malique Bennett‎ (9/10)
The holiday season may have passed, but our beloved institution has tacked on another wintery annual tradition: raising our tuition. Still, we are lured in by prestige and promises of a high salary right after graduating. Let’s hope that the trend of astronomical costs of higher-cost education dwindles.

Carnegie Mellon’s custodial workers have ratified a new four-year contract that will increase wages and simplify job classifications. The contract follows a 2 month negotiation period with Aramark, the contracted company that Carnegie Mellon uses to handle custodial staffing.
The ratification vote took place in the Cohon Center’s McConomy Auditorium this past Friday. In the large lecture hall, spirits were high as custodial staff, many in their maroon uniform jackets, filed in. Towards the front of the auditorium sat a group of students with the CMU Labor Coalition, a campus organization that aims to support Carnegie Mellon employees.
Presiding over the event was Sam Williamson, district director of the Western Pennsylvania 32BJ SEIU union that represents Carnegie Mellon’s custodial staff. He opened the event with a thanks to the CMU Labor Coalition, who he said helped “set the tone from day one” regarding contract negotiation with Aramark. He referred to the coalition’s actions in November of last year, when members of the coalition marched into the open bargaining sessions with Aramark demanding a fair contract.
Williamson introduced Margot Stewart, an undergraduate computer science student and member of the coalition, to address the crowd. “Our coalition will continue to have the backs of workers,” Stewart said to applause, “we will not tolerate mistreatment.” She concluded, “when workers unite, and when workers and students unite, we win.”
The new ratified contract established several changes to the existing one. At the vote, Williamson ran through each change, taking questions as he went. One of the biggest changes is a new wage increase structure that will require a 50 cent wage increase each year for three years, starting in 2021. For 2020, custodial workers will receive a 45 cent per hour raise, and they will get back pay for time they’ve already worked this year.
Job classifications have also been amended by the new contract. The contract introduces a new role of “lead”. Leads are not supervisors or bosses, but will be promoted from within to organize work, and receive higher pay. The job description is forthcoming. In the previous contract, “extras” filled in when people took off on vacation or during short-term vacancies. Now, Williamson explained, Aramark has agreed to simplify job classifications. All former “extras” have part time status, which means they can receive time off proportional to hours worked.
Holiday work assignments have also been amended. Full-time employees can no longer be assigned to work on holidays, and the work will now be classified as overtime. If holiday work needs to be assigned, it will be assigned by inverse seniority, meaning new employees will be called in before more senior employees.
The contract also incorporates new language about sexual harassment complaints. Williamson stated that complaints will now be easier to process, and that Aramark has agreed to investigate claims, even when complaints are against employees or staff members not contracted by the company. The contract also mandates more information sharing with those that file a complaint.
Williamson noted that the new contract makes no concessions on workers’ existing insurance and pension plans with Aramark. According to him, however, this isn’t something Aramark is doing “out of the goodness of their heart.” “They’re scared of you,” Williamson said to the custodial staff sitting about McConomy. Turning to the coalition of students seated at the front, “and they’re scared of you.”
At the time of publishing, Aramark was unable to be reached for comment on this article.

As technology becomes more intertwined with our daily lives, governments, organizations, and researchers have begun taking more actions to increase data privacy rights and awareness among users. This past Tuesday, Carnegie Mellon University hosted its seventh annual Data Privacy Day event to showcase the data privacy research underway at Carnegie Mellon.
Professor Lorrie Cranor, the Director and Bosch Distinguished Professor in Security and Privacy Technologies and one of the event coordinators, told The Tartan that “most people don’t have a lot of awareness about how their privacy is being invaded or the steps that they can take to protect their privacy.” As the only university in the world with a graduate program in privacy engineering, Carnegie Mellon has shouldered some of the responsibility towards combating this lack of awareness.
Researchers and students gathered in the Simmons Auditorium at the Tepper Quadrangle to spread awareness about the importance of data privacy, discuss the dangers of the internet, and share new research done in the field of privacy engineering. Large, colorful posters lined the walls, and researchers in “Privacy Matters” t-shirts explained their work on a variety of topics, conversing with others passionate about data privacy and security.
Projects ranged from analyzing the data protection of smart speakers, to developing apps for improving mobile privacy, to inspecting the quality of ad blockers. One project educated others about the use of cookies and cookie policies. Another studied the data privacy of those using Carnegie Mellon’s network. There was even a booth where attendees could type in a password to test its strength.
Although the topics were diverse, they all emphasized the importance of data protection and privacy. Chenghao Ye, a graduate student in the privacy engineering program, told The Tartan, “It’s quite dangerous if those apps can steal your data, because you have no idea what they can do with it.”
Several projects focused on smart devices, such as TV software like Google TV and Roku TV, and smart speakers like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, devices which have risen in popularity in the past few years. However, researchers and users alike have become increasingly concerned about the data privacy protections on these devices.
Dev Patel, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon studying privacy engineering, posed a hypothetical about data privacy: “Let’s say someone is conversing with a voice assistant, and that conversation may be personal. Maybe they are conversing about something that is about their financial information, and that information can be used by these companies.” As a result, he says, “the person or the customers can be manipulated with the data that is collected.”
Currently, there are few data privacy laws, or companies that address the data protection of its users, so it’s now up to the users themselves to ensure their own data privacy. For smart speaker devices, Chenghao advised users to be careful of the skills (add-on programs similar to apps) that they install. “In terms and conditions, Google and Amazon both claim that they will not be responsible for whatever happens to your skills or to your device, so you have to make sure it is safe by clicking the descriptions of the skill,” he said.
Daniel Mo, who is a graduate student studying privacy engineering, also encourages users to know their data privacy rights. He told The Tartan, “Both Amazon and Google provide the right for all the users to request the deletion of their own private conversations, but most users do not know. We believe that to ensure your privacy, you need to know what rights you have.”
Of this year’s event, Cranor said, “I hope people who came to the event learned a bit about steps they can take to protect their privacy and security online and on their phones and connected devices.”

This week, former Carnegie Mellon University lecturer Clive Newstead returned to campus as part of the hiring process for a new job in the math department. Unlike most other visiting applicants, he also spent time signing students’ textbooks — specifically, one he wrote while he was a student at Carnegie Mellon.
During his visit, Newstead says that “one person printed out the front cover of the book and asked me to sign it.” When he visited in 2019, “one person brought me a copy of Rudin, the analysis textbook, and asked me to sign [it].” Newstead has been highly respected among math undergraduates for the past few years, much more respected than most would expect a math Ph.D. to be — pretty surprising, even to him.
Newstead returned to Carnegie Mellon with many fans in the math department, including a number who were not even enrolled at Carnegie Mellon by the time Newstead left. His esteemed reputation stems from his work as a TA for Mathematical Concepts and Proofs, and his textbook, An Infinite Descent into Pure Mathematics, which he wrote during his time as a TA and a Ph.D student.
His book is now the main text for 21-127: Concepts of Mathematics and 21-128: Mathematical Concepts and Proofs. Students enjoy Newstead’s easy-to-read writing and are inspired by his story of writing the textbook while teaching at Carnegie Mellon is well-known.
His former colleagues in the math department share the same respect for Newstead as their students. Teaching professor John Mackey, who teaches Mathematical Concepts and Proofs for first-year students every fall, wrote of Newstead, “He is certainly the best graduate student with whom I’ve taught during more than thirty years in academia, and he compares favorably to many university-level teaching award winners with whom I have had the good fortune to interact.”
This high praise for Newstead has helped him gain a small fandom. Current Concepts of Mathematics TA Jung Hwan Min said that his own teaching assistants, when he took the class, called Newstead “the legend Clive.”
Newstead has been surprised by much of the reaction to his work. Regarding his time at Carnegie Mellon, Newstead said, “I didn’t play that much of a role [at Carnegie Mellon], to be quite honest.”
After growing up in Yorkshire, England and earning a BA from the University of Cambridge, Newstead came to Pittsburgh as a Carnegie Mellon Ph.D student in 2013. He served as a TA and instructor for a few courses, and he taught another version of Mathematical Concepts and Proofs, Concepts of Mathematics, during the summer of 2015.
He tried looking for a good textbook for the class, but he couldn’t find one that covered enough content without problems. So, he said, “instead of writing a textbook, I took it upon myself to write some lecture notes.” After that class finished, he served as Mackey’s teaching assistant for Mathematical Concepts and Proofs in 2015 and 2016, where he continued writing the lecture notes for Mackey’s class.
Newstead was not particularly famous as a teaching assistant. His notes did, however, became the text for Mackey’s class while Newstead was a teaching assistant. But, Newstead said, “it didn’t really feel any different from when I [taught] it any other time.” 
Newstead did notice that students especially liked his teaching. He said, “I was in a very good place to respond to people’s questions.”
Newstead continued to work on his notes after he stopped teaching for Mackey. “After [teaching] for John Mackey a couple of times, the notes grew and grew,” Newstead said. “It just occurred to me this is basically a textbook.” So, Newstead decided to turn it into one.
While Newstead began a postdoctoral lecturing position at Northwestern University in 2018, students at Carnegie Mellon learned from Newstead’s free textbook and heard stories about him from Mackey and the other teaching assistants. Coupled with the fact that he was away, the legend of Newstead began to grow among math majors. Jung Hwan Min said, “Not many people have personally talked with him.” As a result, “he is often seen [as] more of a distant, admirable figure.”
His legendary status has made returning to campus a bizarre experience to Newstead. “It’s strange to me that [the textbook has]... developed a following of sorts.” He also says it made him nervous when he had to teach a Concepts of Mathematics lecture as part of his application. “Before I was just [a] random, anonymous TA,” Newstead said, but “because I wrote the book, there’s all this expectation.”
Now, Newstead hopes to find a position for after the end of his postdoctoral work. If he returns to Carnegie Mellon, he may get to teach the students who admire his book so much.

While the U.S. is caught in its own fascist nightmare, other countries are dealing with their own. One such case is India, the world’s largest democratic republic, with over 800 million voters. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, has a cult of personality, cultivating the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — the right-wing Hindu-nationalist party that is currently dominating India — as a personal army.
In Dec., the BJP government passed a bill called the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), amending the Citizenship Act of 1955 to provide a pathway to citizenship for refugees and migrants that have fled Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. The key distinction is that the CAA provides a pathway to citizenship for Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, and Sikh refugees, but not Muslim ones. The BJP justifies this by stating that Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan are Muslim-majority countries.
The CAA is related to the National Register of Citizens (NRC), which requires that Indian citizens provide documentation to prove their citizenship. However, the NRC is only implemented in Assam, a state in east India that borders Bangladesh. The register became an issue when many citizens themselves didn’t have proper documentation and were labeled “foreign.” Despite this, the BJP government intends on implementing the register for the entire country.
There is no need to talk about the bill in any depth or the dynamics of religious politics in India. It’s very clearly wrong and is a dangerous move designed to target Muslim minorities and set the precedent to target others. The overtly fascist move sparked large-scale protests from Muslim universities, but expanded to many other universities in India when students were attacked and detained for the initial protest. It’s a far cry from the U.S., where students only seem to protest when their own bubble is directly affected. Even then, many campuses don’t seem to care.
The stress culture or workload in the U.S. is not preventing large-scale mobilization. Indian universities are notoriously difficult, with intense workloads and harsh grading systems. What differs between India and the U.S. is that student activism in India is often backed by political parties on both the national and state level. Unlike U.S. political parties, the Indian political system values the contributions of younger voters, which prompts them to engage more. 
In the U.S., many Republicans hold a condescending belief that younger generations have a “lack of understanding” of the world, so young people’s political views are belittled. The Democrats have their own struggles, having a tough time connecting with the desires and views of younger generations. In contrast with India, even with the culture of respecting elders and the ageist philosophies of elders knowing better, there is an understanding that the younger generations comprise a significant portion of the voters, so it’s best to engage with them. 
With that being said, the BJP has also weaponized student activism, which is fracturing the key demographic. This is nowhere more than at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), a prestigious humanities university and hub for student activism. The primary group on campus is the JNU Students’ Union, which has been outspoken against the CAA and the NRC. On Jan. 5, members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) attacked students and teachers associated with the student union on campus with rods, sticks, and acid. ABVP is a right-wing student group backed by the BJP, and associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing, Hindu-nationalist, volunteer paramilitary group.
While political violence in India is not uncommon, a targeted attack like this was different. The BJP had been working to set themselves up as untouchable, and this attack marks a notable instance of an attempt to silence groups critical of the government’s policies. This has backfired, as universities across India showed solidarity with JNU students, and the calls from students against the Modi government’s fascist tendencies has grown louder. 
A good chunk of the media in India has been focused on the discussion of the BJP’s facilitation of political violence, directly or indirectly. The direct targeting was what made people notice, but the BJP’s role in facilitating that political violence had already been there. It took the JNU attack for the implicit call to violence to be a subject of discussion.
The U.S. is currently in a similar position to that of India. Hate crimes and right-wing terrorist attacks, such as the Tree of Life shooting and the attack at the Unite the Right Charlottesville, are rarely associated with conservative politics by the media and the general public. That would require the Republicans to acknowledge their own passivity in addressing it as well as how the rhetoric espoused by President Trump that emboldened and inspired these attacks. It’s scary that it will take something like an organized, targeted attack on Trump’s critics or something worse before this discussion is even relevant.
A significant factor in the growing radicalization of the right-wing is the weaponization of social media, which is becoming a tool for fascists across the world. The Republicans have set new precedents in the spread of disinformation, through their own platforms on Twitter and other social media, their approval of outlets like Brietbart and Fox News, and their attacks on journalistic integrity. They add their rhetoric on top of it to play themselves off as victims or saints. Simultaneously, the disinformation leads to political violence while undermining whatever integrity is left of the nation’s political system.
India faces a similar issue now. The ABVP organized the JNU attack through WhatsApp. The app, owned by Facebook, has been used to spread disinformation about issues like Kashmir and the CAA. Facebook’s involvement is important. In the U.S., the company has been very hands-off in handling disinformation. But in India, Facebook is practically nonexistent. Disinformation has also spread beyond the BJP, and the government has to shut down the internet at points in their authoritarian attempt to control the situation. But it is still an advantage for the BJP, and it has helped them cultivate a façade of infallibility. 
Ultimately, the goal of fascists is to create hopelessness and undermine our faith in institutions to gain power and control. Both the BJP and the Republicans look like they’re succeeding, rallying around nationalism and religion. It feels hopeless, and the current sense of despair is disheartening. For students in the U.S., it doesn’t help that the political system refuses to engage with us. But, we should take inspiration from the students in India who are standing in solidarity with their peers at JNU. They are fighting for a better future as the fascists try to take it away from them. We should be doing that more intensely. If the political system doesn’t engage us, we’ll engage it.

The War on Drugs began with President Nixon declaring drug abuse “public enemy number one." The War on Drugs — ramped up by the Reagan Administration — has overcrowded the criminal justice system, with about one-fifth of the incarcerated population serving time for drug-related charges. This decades-long war has disproportionately affected people of color and low-income communities. The criminal justice system is broken and longing for repair. Pittsburgh seems to agree.
The city of Pittsburgh is on its way to adopting law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD), which seeks to keep people who commit certain nonviolent crimes — drug possession, prostitution, petty theft — out of the criminal justice system. Instead of taking these nonviolent offenders to jail, the LEAD program relies on the discretion of police departments to turn these individuals over to a social services coordinator. The North Side of Pittsburgh is currently piloting the program. 
The criminal justice system often operates in a cyclical manner, keeping offenders behind bars due to continuous violations. The cycle demonstrates that incarceration does not help individuals with unmet behavioral health needs because many individuals fall back into old habits after their release from jail. Not only is this system ineffective, but it is also very costly. The LEAD program, developed in Seattle, WA, is meant to tackle this very issue.
So far, the LEAD program has been successful in the cities that have adopted it. In the Seattle LEAD program, participants were 58 percent less likely to be arrested after enrollment than those individuals that went through the typical criminal justice cycle. This statistic may not seem too significant, but as more cities around the country adopt LEAD programs, the rate of incarceration for low-level crimes caused by unmet behavioral needs or poverty will begin to decline. Additionally, those individuals who would have served time for such violations will receive the care they need, which will ultimately result in better functioning communities.
It is no secret that America is in the midst of an opioid crisis, with over 130 people dying from opioid overdose. In Pennsylvania, 12 lives are lost each day as a result of drug overdoses. The LEAD program can be an effective way to combat the opioid crisis as any drug-user can walk into a participating police department and ask for help without the threat of arrest. 
The LEAD program places an emphasis on harm-reduction, working with mental health professionals, drug treatment providers, housing providers, and other service agencies to offer a humane alternative to the criminal justice system. Harm-reduction programs meet people where they are and provide the services necessary to help them improve their health and their lives. 
Additionally, the LEAD program has had an unintended positive effect on relations between police and the community. At a time in which policy debates surrounding policing have reached a fever pitch, this unplanned effect should be celebrated. Treating people like human beings instead of criminals can actually bring positive outcomes. Who would have thought?
As Pittsburgh explores the LEAD program, surrounding police departments should consider adopting the program, because investing time and energy into improving peoples’ lives is more productive than locking them up. The LEAD program will not cure all of the ills in the criminal justice system, but points a way forward to a criminal justice revolution.

College education should be free. For everyone. Who decided to put a price tag on education, anyways? Who decided what the monetary value that accompanies certain information should be, what makes one subject more “valuable” than the other, and what knowledge itself is worth?
Knowledge should be considered a fundamental human right for all people, no matter where on the globe they reside. That is why, when I received the email about Carnegie Mellon's decision to raise tuition by 3.2 percent, I became nervous. I consider the approved increase a hindrance to this right. I have a right to learn in an environment where I am not stressed or impacted by my ability to pay for it.
Carnegie Mellon has increased its tuition steadily each year. According to Carnegie Mellon's Finances Institute Research and Analysis (IRA) Factbook, the estimated total cost of attendance for first-year undergraduates has spiked from $49,464 in the 2006-2007 academic year to $67,980 in the 2016-2017 academic year. In ten years, the cost of attendance increased by over $18,000. A classmate of mine proposed that the trend of spiking tuition like this would only discourage students of lower socioeconomic status from applying to Carnegie Mellon in the first place. Unfortunately, I have to agree. The prospect of simply being able to afford going to a good college should not cause brilliant and dedicated students to shy away from applying.
Yet, with tuition inching closer and closer to costing six figures each year, it is perfectly valid for anyone scouting for colleges to widen their eyes in surprise and take Carnegie Mellon off their list of options. Most students in the U.S. that come from households struggling financially already find it hard to pay for the fees to take subject tests and apply to the colleges themselves. Adding to those expenses the potentially ridiculous cost of tuition, just to graduate with suffocating debt, isn’t doing prospective students any favors.
On the other hand, I will give it to Carnegie Mellon that along with this 3.2 percent increase in tuition, there was also an increase made by 3.8 percent in the amount of financial aid provided. However, many students don't receive financial aid, so they are not affected by the increase. 
I thought of my international friends who are provided no financial aid as non-U.S. residents. On top of not receiving aid from Carnegie Mellon as an institution, they are unable to apply for an overwhelming majority of scholarships, based on the same premise that they are not U.S. residents. Now, let’s look at how this impacts international students statistically. In 2018-19, the school was ranked one of the top 5 U.S. institutions with the highest amount of international students in attendance. 22 percent of students at Carnegie Mellon are international students, according to Carnegie Mellon's Undergraduate International Students webpage and the U.S. News Short List. This means that the increase in financial aid provided to compensate for the increase in tuition does not apply to 22 percent of the student body. With virtually no aid provided, it’s highly plausible this increase would further discourage applications from  talented individuals not just from America’s lower socioeconomic classes, but from across the globe.
At this point, it costs less to attend Princeton, Harvard, Stanford, and Yale. The continual tuition increase is a dangerous form of economic exclusion. It is preventing certain demographics of people from obtaining the opportunities and the education that Carnegie Mellon has to offer, and it is placing loans and piles of debt into the hands of current students. The debt increase leads to increased levels of stress and generalized financial anxiety across the student body. 
If Carnegie Mellon University wants to provide the optimal “diversity, equity, and inclusion” that they so tirelessly advertise, the “stress-free” environment for their students, then they should live up to their word — beginning with their tuition.

Manuel Brito grew up in a small city in Guatemala, surviving violent persecution as a member of the Ixil community, a Maya indigenous people targeted by a genocidal government operation. He eventually fled after conscripted military service, walking through the desert borderlands and making it to Pittsburgh at 20 years old. He reunited with his dad and found steady work.
In 2015, while tracking down an unaccompanied minor in Pittsburgh, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) found Manuel. He was deported back to Guatemala in 2017. Two years later, Manuel Brito was found murdered on the side of the road.
In Jan. 2018, ICE arrested an individual at Union Grill in a “targeted enforcement operation.” Every week, around 35 undocumented immigrants are targeted and deported in Pittsburgh.
Carnegie Mellon’s proximity to these stories is not just the walk to Union Grill or the short distance to the Berks County Family Detention Center. Two pipelines are happening in our community: one that deports people to abuse and death, and one that sends students to build that very deportation pipeline. 
Technology makes this pipeline deadly and invasive. It enables ICE, a federal law enforcement agency under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, to obtain the location, detain, and deport undocumented immigrants. 
The Trump administration has made drastic changes since Jan. 2017 to how ICE performs detentions and deportations. These changes include an increase in the number of raids, the length of detention time, and the number of immigrant detainees without criminal records. 
Under executive orders and political pressure to deport, ICE relies on technological augmentation more than ever. By establishing billion-dollar contracts with software companies, ICE uses these tools to process, track, and target data from undocumented immigrants, especially from those with elapsed visas and from those with families and homes in the United States. 
Palantir is one of the key technology providers enabling ICE to carry out mass raids, detentions, and deportations at unprecedented rates. Palantir sells two technological tools to ICE. The first, Investigative Case Management (ICM), is “mission critical.” According to official government records, it was used at the border to investigate the families and sponsors of children who crossed the border alone. The operation is designed to dissuade children from joining their families in the United States, and it resulted in the arrests of at least 443 people over 90 days.
Palantir’s second tool, FALCON, is used by ICE agents to carry out workplace raids. This technology enabled these raids to increase by 650 percent during President Trump’s first year in office, leading to thousands of undocumented immigrants being arrested and subsequently deported. On Aug. 7, 2019, FALCON enabled the largest workplace raid in Mississippi. ICE agents arrested 689 people en masse, leaving hundreds of children to come home to find their parents missing. At least two children were left unaccompanied for eight days because both of their parents were arrested and detained by ICE.
On two separate occasions last year, Palantir has come to campus to recruit. The first was a secretive session organized by the School of Computer Science on Oct. 2nd, 2019. The second was an alumni recruiting talk as a part of the Master of Science in Information Technology (MSIT) Privacy Seminar series. Only five out of the 60 students present at the Privacy Seminar knew what ICE was, despite being recruited to join a company that enabled ICE deportation work on immigrant communities. Many of these students being recruited were international students who also face greater vulnerability in workplaces with work sponsorship. The Carnegie Mellon University community, as well as international students across the U.S., deserve universities that serve as safe spaces from the terror of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
This responsibility is even more important in light of recent news of Iranian students being deported following the U.S.-Iranian military escalation in early Jan., and ICE beginning workplace visits for some students participating in the federal Optional Practical Training program: a program that allows those with student visas to take temporary jobs related to their academic studies. 
At Carnegie Mellon, 338 students have signed a petition as a part of Mijente's #NoTechForICE campaign, and 39 faculty and staff have signed a petition citing they strongly object to Palantir's presence on our campus. Carnegie Mellon students have expressed their outrage with Palantir's presence on our campus multiple times, gaining broad community support from student groups, nonprofits, and organizations working with immigrants and refugees. Carnegie Mellon University hosting a company that actively develops tools enabling mass raids, detentions, deportations, and family separation is not only harmful, but in direct violation of the university's statement of support for DACA students. 
Additionally, as a charter member of the Public Interest Technology University Network, Carnegie Mellon University has pledged “to consider, evaluate, and consciously address the way that new technologies impact the world from a social, political, and economic perspective.” There is no better opportunity to demonstrate an awareness of technology's societal impact than to stop actively encouraging a pipeline that sends students to work for inherently harmful companies. The first steps towards this would be to stop inviting Palantir onto our campus or granting Palantir recruiting space, release an official statement pledging to cease all relations with the company, and actively support marginalized communities with scholarships, resources, more student liaisons, and immigration support.
As a Carnegie Mellon University representative would certainly state — as they have in the past — this university supports “freedom of speech.” Does this university also support harm reduction? Does this university also take responsibility to act in response to human rights abuses?
When it comes to choice, undocumented immigrants do not ask to be surveilled, targeted, and deported. They do not choose to be held in cages, separated from their families, left to wait for a court case that may never come. They do not choose to get their rights violated every single day. 
As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, we should not be giving a platform to the work of family separation, migrant detention, and human rights violations. Carnegie Mellon must stop normalizing and supporting harmful technology development and take responsibility for the impacts of student work, or accept an institutional legacy of harm.

Last Monday night, a post on the Facebook group Overlooked At Carnegie Mellon drew attention to something most students probably don’t think about after orientation: the guides to Pittsburgh distributed by our school. Although they might look perfectly innocent, they are actually far from it, perfectly highlighting the power of maps and of institutions like Carnegie Mellon in determining the destiny of communities. And they should alert us all to the way this power has been used historically to place communities of color in disadvantageous positions in cities across America. 
Up until this week, there was a similarly problematic map in the basement of the Cohon University Center, right outside the game room. While the map colorfully highlighted neighborhoods that are familiar to Carnegie Mellon students — Shadyside, Squirrel Hill, the North Side — they very obviously omitted information about some neighborhoods which are just as close to campus, like the Hill District and Garfield, which have been centers of Black culture and multicultural history in Pittsburgh for decades.
The problems here are much deeper than just pamphlets at the admissions desk and a mural in the basement of the Cohon Center. These maps reinforce a legacy of racial and economic discrimination in the city of Pittsburgh that goes back almost a century. In the 1930s, the federal government created “Residential Security Maps” of America’s cities, which dictated to banks which neighborhoods were “secure” for them to make real estate investments and issue loans to potential homeowners. Those which were deemed “not secure” were outlined in red — this practice became known as “redlining” — and the neighborhoods deemed “not secure” were almost always predominantly Black ones. 
Pittsburgh’s Hill District was entirely redlined, as was much of Garfield and East Liberty. Because it was near-impossible to get a mortgage on a home in a redlined neighborhood, few people moved to or invested in those areas. This led to their further decline, triggering a negative feedback loop of decline, disinvestment, and discrimination. Neighborhoods which became victims of this cycle were then easily dismissed as being “blighted,” “undesirable,” and “high-crime,” which allows individuals and institutions like Carnegie Mellon to justify the erasure of these communities’ histories.
The Hill District, located between Downtown and Oakland, was once known as the “crossroads of the world.” It was a center of Black culture, not just in Pittsburgh but also in the country. Its clubs, like the Crawford Grill, whose building still stands today, hosted some of the era’s greatest musicians. Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, John Coltrane, and Louis Armstrong all made stops in the Hill District as they toured America; its main streets along Centre and Wylie Avenues were home to dozens of thriving Black-owned businesses. The Pittsburgh Crawfords, a Negro League baseball team started in the Hill District, became one of the best Black baseball teams in the country (future MLB great Satchel Paige got his start on the Crawfords). Their Greenlee Field was the first Black-built-and-owned baseball stadium in the United States. 
As with many Black neighborhoods across the country, the Hill District was selected as a site for “urban renewal” in the 1950s. To facilitate planners’ vision of a “renewed” neighborhood, 8,000 residents — the vast majority of whom were Black — were displaced from 1,500 buildings to make space for a hockey arena and parking lots for people visiting Downtown. This was done with little regard for the existing community. One Pittsburgh City Council member, George E. Evans, wrote in support of the renewal plan in a July 1943 issue of Greater Pittsburgh magazine, saying “there would be no social loss if [buildings] were all destroyed.” As this “renewal” disconnected the residents of the Hill District from Downtown Pittsburgh, the vicious cycle brought about by disinvestment began. Since the 1950s, the Hill District has lost the vast majority of its peak population and many of its businesses. But history shows us that further neglect of communities only makes the situation worse by perpetuating the cycle of disinvestment. That’s why it was so disappointing to see our school, which has the power to be a force for positive change, instead elect to buy into the narrative of “undesirable” neighborhoods and encourage patterns of racial discrimination.    
Some responses to this might point to the same conclusion as Wikipedia’s article about the Hill District: the area has “struggled with varying levels of dilapidation and crime,” therefore suggesting that Carnegie Mellon is right not to recommend students to visit the area. But according to real estate website NeighborhoodScout, which publishes maps of crime rates by neighborhood, the Hill and Garfield have crime rates comparable to East Liberty, as well as parts of Shadyside, both of which are featured on Carnegie Mellon's guides. 
These exclusionary maps have several effects on student life as well. First of all, students are missing out on things to do beyond the walls of our campus. Garfield, for example, is home to numerous art and creative spaces, such as Assemble, The Irma Freeman Center for Imagination, and the Pittsburgh Glass Center (where students are already able to register for classes!). The Hill District contains the August Wilson House, the birth home of the award-winning Black playwright August Wilson; the Ujamaa Collective, a space dedicated to promoting entrepreneurship among Black women; and numerous community gardens and urban farms. Both of these neighborhoods are easy to access on buses that stop near campus. Thirdly, and perhaps most tragically, we are failing to show students of color, many of whom already feel underrepresented on our campus, that our connection to the history of the city of Pittsburgh is important to our university.
Carnegie Mellon must take action to rectify this. There is tremendous value in producing guides to the city of Pittsburgh; as students, we tend to forget that the world does actually continue on the other side of Forbes Avenue. Although our time for non-academic activities can be limited, we should take those opportunities to get out and get to know the city. But these guides must be written and produced in a way that centers around not just the student experience, but the experience of the communities in our city. We should reach out directly to residents and institutions across Pittsburgh — particularly in those communities which weren’t featured in our previous guides. Our goal should be not only to create better maps but to actually be an ally, as a university, to communities which we have neglected. This week’s activity on social media shed light on the apprehension towards Carnegie Mellon that exists in many Pittsburgh communities, who fear that interventions from institutions like ours will fuel displacement and gentrification. We can start to turn this around by reaching out to communities in a way that is focused on the work that they have done to restore their neighborhoods in the face of systemic discrimination.
We have the power right now to address this in a way that uplifts Pittsburgh’s communities — to reverse decades of inequality, not to advancing our school’s interests — as well as students of color on campus who feel their history has been erased and ignored. As students, we can take action by spending our weekends getting to know the world that exists beyond our campus. And we can all learn a lesson about how powerful a map, something we often take for granted, can be at perpetuating narratives. It is up to us now to decide what narrative about Pittsburgh’s communities we want to convey to students and our city.
