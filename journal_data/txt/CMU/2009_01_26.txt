The Carnegie Mellon swimming and diving teams finished strong in their last home meet of the year against Westminster College this past Saturday. The men’s team finished with a 151–111 victory margin while the women closed out the meet with a final score of 153–109. Both teams are currently 7–2 and have two more away meets left in the season before the University Athletic Association (UAA) finals.
Senior Tom McConnell led the sweep of the mile, taking first place in 16:10.71 and followed by Tartan juniors Jonas Altman-Kurosaki and Gates Winkler. Sophomore Josh Matthews later led the sweep of the 200-yard freestyle, finishing in a season best time of 1:44.45. Matthews was followed by his classmates Alex Hanson and Frank Olechnowicz, who placed second and third respectively.
Junior Jeff Dahlen recorded two first place finishes in the 100- and 200-yard backstroke. Touching only .04 seconds ahead of a Westminster swimmer, Dahlen closely held the lead in the 200-yard race. The 200-yard medley was won by the Carnegie Mellon quartet of juniors Scott Moorby and Jason Huber, sophomore Travis Piper, and senior Ron Papa. Papa also won the 100-yard freestyle in a time of 48.18 and later the 200-yard IM with a season best time of 1:58.94. Huber claimed first in the 100-yard breaststroke with a time of 59.28.
The women’s team recorded nine first-place finishes, the first coming during the opening race of the meet. Sophomore Brianne Burton overcame Westminister on the last leg of the 200-yard medley relay to finish with a time of 1:51.80.
Burton continued to dominate, setting career-high times of 24.73 in the 50-yard freestyle and 54.32 in the 100-yard freestyle. The sophomore was later part of the team to win the 400-yard freestyle relay with a time of 3:47.49. Team members included junior Sara Andrews and first-years Chrissy Swerkocki and Kaitlin Ahrens.
Coming away with three first- place finishes was sophomore Molly Evans. Evans finished the 100-yard backstroke in 1:00.24, the 200-yard backstroke in 2:07.97 and the 200-yard IM in 2:10.99.
Sophomore Rebecca Ussai took first in the 200-yard butterfly and her teammates Jen Sung and Victoria Adams finished second and third to give the team a sweep, both first-years. Ussai recorded a winning time of 2:12.43 and Sung recorded a season best of 2:15.48. Adams also placed second in both the 1650 and 500-yard freestyles, swimming a career-best 18:01.57 in the 1650.
On the diving board, senior Alex DeFazio scored a 259.95 on the 3-meter board, provisionally qualifying her for the NCAA Championships.
The last home meet of any season is usually a symbolic event, especially for the senior swimmers. Burton commented on the final home meet saying, “It was really nice that everyone was able to step it up, especially for our graduating seniors.” The Tartan swimmers have much to look forward to as they take on their final two opponents of the regular season, Denison University and University of Pittsburgh.
The teams will be in the pool again next weekend at Denison University. The meet begins at noon.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s basketball team came away 1–1 in a University Athletic Association (UAA) doubleheader this weekend, but in preparation for the UAA weekend, the Tartans took on an out-of-conference game against the Lycoming College Warriors Tuesday. The Tartans defeated Lycoming 71–56 by starting the game with a 14–4 run in the first nine and a half minutes of play. The Warriors attempted a comeback by bringing the score to 14–10, but the Tartans pulled away once again, going on a 10–2 run. Carnegie Mellon maintained the lead throughout the game, but the Warriors cut the Tartans’ lead to nine with 2:22 left in the game. The Tartans pulled away with a 71–56 victory. Senior guard Ryan Einwag led the team with 22 points, followed by sophomore Shane Rife with 13.
On Friday, the 18th-ranked Tartans took on the Maroons of the University of Chicago and came away with a 64–58 win. As a personal tradition for UAA games, senior guard Elliott Curtis dressed in his lucky Tartan plaid socks. Socks or no socks, the Tartans came out strong in the opening minutes of the game and kept the momentum throughout the game, never allowing the Maroons to take a lead.
The Tartans ran into some trouble early in the game with their leading scorer Einwag accumulating three fouls and only seeing five minutes of action in the first half. Einwag is 54.7 percent from the field this year and 38.5 percent from the three-point line. Senior Corey O’Rourke stepped up for the Tartans, scoring six points in the first nine minutes. Junior Jack Anderson helped carry the slack with seven points in the first half. The first half was a physical and defensive battle as the Maroons scored 10 of their 24 points off free throws. The Tartans ended the half with a 30–24 lead.
Anderson came out powerfully in the second half, scoring seven of the team’s first 13 points and giving Carnegie Mellon a 14-point lead with 14:44 to play. The Tartans seemed to be pulling away and fans thought the game was all but over after a monster dunk by senior Terrance Bouldin-Johnson extended the lead to 16 with 14:23 left. But the Maroons refused to cave, and they rallied after Einwag picked up his fourth foul. With just 3:46 in the game, the Maroons brought the score to 56–52, and the rest of the game came down to the final seconds. The Tartans held on and secured a 64–58 win. In the victory, the Tartans were led by Anderson with 18 points and O’Rourke followed suit with a season high of 15 points.
On Sunday, the Tartans took on last year’s national champions, Washington University in St. Louis, who are currently third-ranked. The former national champions proved to be too much for the Tartans, who fell 90–70 to the Bears. The first five minutes were an even match as there were seven lead changes, but with 6:41 to go in the half, the Bears went on a 9–0 run taking a 32–29 lead. WashU maintained its lead throughout the half entering the break with a 44–37 lead.
The Tartans cut the Bears’ lead to three early in the first half, but the Bears soon caught fire and went on a 17–0 run pulling ahead 67–47. As the second half continued, it seemed as though WashU could not miss. “We played well and we played hard but [the Bears] were shooting great,” said senior Rob Pearson. “They were the national champions last year so we knew they would be good, but we get to play them twice so we will be even more ready for the next game.”
In the loss, the Tartans were led by Anderson who scored a career high of 25 points followed by Einwag with 13.
The Tartans head to Atlanta, Ga. for UAA games against Emory  University and Case Western Reserve University on Friday and Sunday.

With just a handful of meets left before the NCAA Championships take place in March, senior swimmer Tom McConnell has proven that he wants to be competing until the end of the season to complete his collegiate career on a high note. 
McConnell has had strong showings at the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships throughout his career at Carnegie Mellon, and he qualified for the national meet last season. 
While the Tartans are keeping their eyes on a first-place conference finish this year, McConnell talked with The Tartan about his experiences as a swimmer and an artist at Carnegie Mellon.
Tartan: Since Pittsburgh’s winter weather is usually less than enjoyable, are there any particular ways that you try to beat the cold? 
McConnell: It’s pretty bitter walking to morning practice at 5 a.m. in January, so I usually drive to school to avoid the walk.
T: What area of art interests you the most, and do you plan on working with that in your career? What are your plans for next year? 
M: I’m most interested in animation. I am going to pursue a career as an independent artist/animator. 
Next year I will probably stay in Pittsburgh because it’s a cheap place to live and there is a burgeoning art scene with lots of great opportunities for young artists.
T: Do you have a favorite artist, or an artist that you sometimes emulate through your work? 
M:  There are a number of artists who influence me, and I’m constantly finding new people to be inspired by. Lately, I have been really into the animations of Fleischer studios from the 1920s and 1930s.
T: Which bands or musicians are on your warm-up playlists while you are at meets? 
M: I don’t really listen to music before races.
T: Do you have any big plans for spring break as a senior? 
M: Hopefully I’ll be here at school training for NCAAs. If not, I might go home and see my family.
T: Where is your all-time favorite place to swim? 
M: The ocean is the best place to swim.
T: Of your four years at Carnegie Mellon thus far, which would you say was the best? The worst? Why? 
M: My junior year was the best since I made the most progress with swimming and work. Freshman year was the worst because I kept getting homesick.
T: One last question: any predictions for Super Bowl XLIII? 
M: Go Steelers!
The Tartan swimming and diving teams will travel to Denison University Saturday and the University of Pittsburgh the following weekend before heading to the University of Chicago for the UAA Championships during the weekend of Feb. 12.

This year’s National Football League (NFL) playoffs have played out as if they were designed by a year-old blueprint. Once again we see a storied powerhouse emerge from the American Football Conference (AFC), Goliath to the NFC’s unlikely David of a representative team. The Pittsburgh Steelers have surprised no one by emerging from the three-week AFC round robin on top, although like the New England Patriots last year, it hasn’t come without its doubtful moments. On the other side, the Arizona Cardinals have emerged as this year’s New York Giants, putting together a stellar four consecutive weeks, beginning with the last game of the regular season, in which they have scored 30 points in every game.
Last year, it was in vogue at the end of January to suggest the Giants would be able to trip the seemingly unstoppable Patriots on their way to a perfect season. This year, however, the Cardinals are not being given a lick of a chance to prevent the Steelers from attaining what would be an NFL record sixth Super Bowl in franchise history.
With a potent passing attack featuring Larry Fitzgerald, probably the most valuable player of these playoffs, lining up opposite a now healthy and always dangerous Anquan Boldin, the Arizona Cardinals can shift the momentum of any game within the blink of an eye. The Cardinals are always one acrobatic Fitzgerald catch away from scoring a touchdown, and thus can never be counted out in any game regardless of the score. Against the league’s number three defense a week ago, the Cardinals blew the game open with 24 points in the first half to Philadelphia’s three, with Fitzgerald catching all three touchdowns. Although this lead all but disappeared in the second half, it is a testament to how quickly Arizona’s offense can take control of a game.
Nonetheless, such a performance will be difficult to repeat against a Steelers defense that has once again lived up to its Steel Curtain name by finishing the season ranked statistically at the top of nearly every category. Safety Troy Polamalu not only sports the same hairdo as Fitzgerald, but is every bit as much the game changer, whether leaping over the line of scrimmage to single-handedly prevent a pivotal fourth down conversion against Baltimore last week or making a game-ending interception. The matchup of Fitzgerald versus Polamalu will be one of the decisive ones this Super Bowl and certainly will be entertaining to watch.
But as fun as it will be to watch the top-tiered Cardinals offense and Steelers defense face off, more crucial to the outcome of this game will be what happens when the Steelers have the ball. With number one target and Super Bowl XL MVP Hines Ward hampered by a sprained medial collateral ligament, Pittsburgh, with an already average offense at best, will have a tough time putting points on the board. Against a Cardinals defense that has forced 11 turnovers in the past three weeks, not having Pittsburgh’s most reliable offensive weapon at 100 percent will be a huge disadvantage. If the Cardinals defense is able to continue to take the ball away from Pittsburgh at the same rate they have all playoffs, the Steelers may see their sixth trophy begin to fade away.
It is no coincidence that both teams are led by quarterbacks that have won the Super Bowl in the past. Experience on the game’s biggest stage is a huge asset to have during the playoffs, especially in the quarterback position. But while Kurt Warner and Ben Roethlisberger both own Super Bowl rings, only Warner has a Super Bowl loss on his résumé. Warner was on a Goliath team of his own back in 2002, when then no-name quarterback Tom Brady and his still unproven Patriots prevented Warner’s 14-point favorite St. Louis from winning back-to-back Super Bowls. Warner knows how hard it is to win the Super Bowl, and he also knows how little bearing the line set in Vegas or the predictions made on ESPN have on the actual outcome of the championship game.
It is unlikely the former league MVP will fail to rise to the occasion, or anyone on this Cardinals team for that matter. The Cardinals have disproven media analysts every week of the playoffs by advancing further and further toward their first Super Bowl appearance ever. Arizona is playing with a chip on its shoulder, and thus counting the team out Feb. 1 would be a huge mistake. Everyone should expect a nail-biter Super Bowl Sunday — and don’t be surprised if the Cardinals attain their first Lombardi trophy as well.

Last Monday, the Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team traveled to Oberlin College to take on the Yeowomen. In a tight contest, the Tartans used strong defense to come up victorious, 52–47. Then the Tartans played host to the University of Chicago on Friday and Washington University in St. Louis on Sunday. Chicago, however, proved too strong as the Tartans fell 66–38. With that, the Tartans dropped their record to 5–10 on the year and 0–4 in University Athletic Association (UAA) action.
Against Oberlin, the Tartans led 20–16 with 6:58 to play in the first period, after a jumper by first-year Jacki Cortese. Oberlin then rallied with a 12–5 run to end the half, leading 26–25.
The second half started with high defensive pressure from the Tartans, forcing the Yeowomen into six turnovers in seven possessions. The Tartans then capitalized on the Yeowomen’s mistakes, with a 10–2 run, resulting in a 35–28 advantage. Senior Stacie Aleski had two consecutive baskets during the run.
Oberlin fought hard, but the Tartans never lost their lead. A three-pointer by senior Colleen Light put the Tartans up 50–45 with 2:06 to play. Tough defense then prevailed for the Tartans, and Light finally sealed the win with two free throws with just five seconds remaining.
After the game, Light commented on the team’s performance, “Our main focus was to play great team defense and use that to create our offense.”
Cortese led the Tartans with 12 points off the bench while Aleski tied her season-high with 10 points. Light finished with seven points while senior Rachelle Roll scored nine and grabbed five boards.
Against Chicago, the Tartans looked to continue their mindset of turning defense into offense. Prior to the start of the game, Aleski gave The Tartan insight on the team’s approach: “The focus is to stop them with tough team defense and make every trip down the floor on offense a scoring situation.” Light added onto her teammate’s response, “In order to be successful against Chicago, we would have to continue to play solid defense, take care of the ball and limit our turnovers.”
The strategy seemed to prove effective as Carnegie Mellon jumped out to an early 6–4 lead off a three-point basket by Aleski. However, the Maroons fought back with a 12–2 run to take a 16–8 lead with 12:17 to go in the first half. They continued to build on that lead, obtaining the biggest lead of the half, at 30–13. The half ended with the score at 33–19, with the Maroons leading.
The Tartans came out strong in the second half, scoring the first five points to cut the deficit to 33–24. However, Chicago’s fierce shooting proved too strong for the Tartans as Chicago eventually prevailed, 66–38.
The Maroons dominated in the paint, scoring 42 points to the Tartans 16. Chicago finished the game shooting 49 percent from the floor while the Tartans ended the game shooting 20 percent.
Aleski led the Tartans with a season-high 12 points. Cortese finished the game with seven points and a game-high 10 rebounds. First-year Alison Aunkst also recorded a career-high eight rebounds.
Chicago was guided by a core of players as junior Molly Hackney led the charge with 12 points. Sophomore Alex Leach and junior Micaela White cashed in with 11 and 10, respectively. Hackney and White totaled eight rebounds each for the Maroons.
Next, the Tartans played host to 23-ranked Washington University in St. Louis and fell 61–72 to close out the UAA double-header. Although the Tartans led 34–26 after the first half, the Bears rallied and stepped up their offense to take the win. Aunskt led the team in total points with 18, followed by Aleski with 14 points and seven rebounds, and Cortese with 13 points and eight rebounds.
The Tartans travel to Emory University this weekend to take on the Emory Eagles and Case Western Reserve University.

Last Saturday, Carnegie Mellon Athletics and the Student Athletic Advisory Counsel (SAAC) introduced the first Tartan Olympics. The games kicked off during a halftime show at the women’s basketball game Friday with a three-point shot competition that continued later during the men’s basketball game at halftime. Aside from the first event the night before, the rest of the Olympic events commenced Saturday. There were 17 teams lined up at the Opening Ceremony held in Skibo Gymnasium, ready to compete for as many points as possible in order to win the grand prize of $500 with runner-up prizes available.
Before the games began, Sarah Strano, a member of Engineers without Borders and double major in engineering and public policy and civil and environmental engineering, commented on the first Tartan Olympics: “Personally, I’m excited for karaoke. These games will help us build a sense of teamwork.” Heading into the games, teams battled it out and struggled to show their strengths in a game of tug-of-war. After the battle of the bodies came, the battle of the minds ensued and the Olympics broke into a series of mind-boggling, finger-twisting, and brain-engaging events. With a Rubik’s cube relay, Knock-Out, Tartan Trivia, Theater, and a Spelling Bee under way, students were challenged to complete grueling tasks perfectly in order to advance by gaining points for their team.
“I have an all-star team together. I’m very excited about the events, especially dodgeball. They call me sticky hands,” said junior chemical engineering major Muhammed Shodeinde who played for the National Society for Black Engineers (NSBE) team before the games began. Unfortunately they were knocked out in the second game. One of the events that drew a big crowd was karaoke, which invited participants and bystanders to sing along to the music. The event was initially a tie between Amusement Park and NSBE, but NSBE pulled through with the win.
Students stood around the pool to cheer on friends as they watched the splash competition. At the closing ceremony, NSBE left the competition victorious with $500, they will put the money toward their organization. The second place team left with Scottie Dog bobbleheads donated by the University Center bookstore and the third-place team received Jimmy John’s gift certificates. After a successful first Tartan Olympics, psychology junior Ashley Reid, who came to watch the games, said she hopes to watch next year. “Maybe I’ll join a team.”

For Luis von Ahn, an assistant professor in the computer science department at Carnegie Mellon, developing innovative programs to accomplish work is just part of his everyday routine. Von Ahn, recently named in Discover magazine’s “50 Best Brains in Science,” is the creator of Games with a Purpose (GWAP) and reCAPTCHA, two programs that have affected millions of people worldwide.
He first thought of creating these programs when he noticed that much time is wasted online by playing games or surfing the Web. With the help of the Microsoft Research Fellowship and MacArthur Fellowship, he started working on making use of the time that people worldwide spent on the Internet.
He decided to find a way to use that time to do work computers could not, such as digitizing old books with smudged words or accurately labeling pictures in Google’s image database. Essentially, von Ahn has created a productive service that is powered for free by the world.
Games with a Purpose are programs that allow users to have fun while at the same time helping label and categorize various types of media for an organization. In one game, called ESP, two anonymous players are shown an image and are supposed to type words to describe the picture. When the words both players type match, they are awarded points and a new image is shown. The associated labels are then stored with the picture on some database, such as Google Images. Another game has two players listen to an audio clip and write a description of what they hear. 
By using human input to solve these simple problems, the Internet population is also helping computers to act like humans.
“Literally billions of hours are wasted everyday by people playing games online, so the question is can we do something good with that?” von Ahn said. “As [a] side effect, we are kind of recycling their brain energy.”
The reCAPTCHA service is von Ahn’s more well-known brainchild. It originally started off as a spam blocker for commercial websites. CAPTCHA, as it was originally called, would display a distorted word that only a human would be able to recognize. 
That way, computer spam programs would not be able read the word, and thus could not access the website. It is estimated that 200 million people take 10 seconds to type a CAPTCHA every day.
However, once the program became popular, von Ahn began feel guilty about his program, since it wasted a combined 150,000 hours a day. 
“When I heard this [the popularity of CAPTCHA], I was quite proud of myself, because I thought, look at the impact my research has had: I mean 200 million people a day. And then I started feeling bad because each time you type one of these CAPTCHAs, you waste 10 seconds of your time. If you multiply that by 200 million, that is a lot of hours wasted.”
Von Ahn created a new program, reCAPTCHA, which took distorted words from old books and literature and had users translate them instead. When several people typed a word the same way, it would be placed into the digitized text version of the book.
To date, his reCAPTCHA programs have almost finished digitizing every New York Times article published since 1851.
“Your brain is doing something a computer cannot yet do. Your brain is doing something amazing for 10 seconds, so can we use those 10 seconds for something useful? When you type that word, you are helping the computer recognize the word,” von Ahn said.
The most recent project von Ahn is working on is with Severin Hacker, a graduate student in the computer science department. This program is a type of translator game, which will take a sentence from a foreign document and list all the possible definitions below it. 
A human user will then go and pick a string of words that makes the most sense from the choices. The best part of this program is that the user doesn’t even have to know a second language to play. Von Ahn stated that test human translations of German sentences into English were more accurate than translations performed by a computer. 
He also explained that programs like these help computers identify nuances of the human language so as to provide better translations. This type of program could be used to help online resources like Wikipedia translate English pages into other languages.
Although he has created numerous programs with international impact and received media attention and prestigious honors like Popular Science’s Annual Brilliant 10, von Ahn humbly dismisses them. 
When asked about his accomplishments, von Ahn said, “I feel like I could do more. It’s funny, I think the most rewarding part is teaching [my class], it is not my research.”

The lethal wave of cholera that broke out in Zimbabwe last fall is rapidly spreading to other parts of southern Africa, devastating communities in its path. Indian waters are heavily contaminated with pollutants dumped in them by drug factories. Naturally occurring arsenic washes ashore on the coasts of Bangladesh.
All of this contaminated water claims thousands of lives every year. Waterborne disease is hard to battle, but certainly not impossibly so. With the creation of “LifeStraw,” a customized line of water purifiers introduced by Vestergaard Frandsen, high-ranking specialists in emergency response and disease control textiles, combating waterborne infections may not be so hard anymore.
The LifeStraw series includes two water purifying systems: LifeStraw Personal and LifeStraw Family. While LifeStraw Personal is a portable device meant for individual use, LifeStraw Family is aimed at groups of people sharing the water distributed from the filter.
Both systems effectively remove 99.99 percent of all bacteria, viruses, and parasites from contaminated water. Also, both can be used as point-of-use treatment filters. This basically means that they can be located at the faucets in single households, enabling pure water to flow in from residential taps. They can be carried, stored, and even shipped with utmost convenience due to their lightweight construction.
LifeStraw Personal is particularly geared toward the traveler, since it conveniently provides the user with safe, clean drinking water wherever they are. Despite its portable structure, it can filter at least 700 liters of water.
With a high impact polystyrene outer shell, LifeStraw Personal resembles a clinical syringe and has a neck string attached to it. The primary active ingredient used here is halogenated resin that is prepared without using any halogen acids. Halogens deactivate the harmful bacteria, making the water safe for consumption. After careful testing on common bacteria like Escherichia coli B and Enterococcus faecalis (indicators of fecal contamination) and virus MS-2 coliphage (an indicator of human enteric viruses), LifeStraw Personal proved to eradicate large quantities of these contaminants, removing particles as small as 15 microns.
Furthermore, it can be easily used in rural areas that experience irregular electricity supply or are more prone to power outages, since it requires no electrical power or spare parts at any point. LifeStraw Family, on the other hand, is a larger-scale product with a higher flow rate and the ability to purify highly muddy water. It comes with a wide blue bucket to contain the water, while the filter sanitizes the water.
It can filter at least 18,000 liters of water, thus providing hygienic drinking water to a family for up to three years (based on the assumption that a family’s consumption will not exceed 20 liters daily).
Just like LifeStraw Personal, LifeStraw Family does not depend on electricity or battery charge, and does not require any spare parts during its lifetime. LifeStraw Family has undergone tests at the University of Arizona similar to the ones performed on LifeStraw Personal for its lifespan, durability, and microbial reduction performance. 
The water purification systems are equipped with easy-to-clean pre-filters and purifier cartridges.
Vestergaard Frandsen has also launched a program that makes it possible to donate LifeStraw systems to impoverished regions that have restricted access to clean water and where waterborne diseases are rampant.
IMA World Health and Rotary International are some of the major donation agents that supply LifeStraw to these areas. The Danish manufacturers have also conducted a pilot study using LifeStraw in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The LifeStraw line has been approved by the World Health Organization and has received several accolades and awards during the past decade, including the “One of the ‘Ten Things that Will Change the Way We Live’” award by Forbes Magazine and “Best Invention of 2005” by TIME.

Rangos Hall was buzzing with excitement Friday as faculty from Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon gathered to congratulate Dr. Rajiv Jain, Chief of Staff and MRSA Program Director at the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS), for his Service to America Medal for Citizen Services. The Service to America Medals (Sammies) award program honors those who serve in the federal work force and have shown extreme commitment toward the betterment of the country. These are some of the most prestigious awards given to America’s civil servants, and in 2008, eight such medals were presented, one of which was awarded to Jain. 
He was chosen for his momentous leadership in an initiative that reduced the MRSA infection in VAPHS hospitals by 60 percent. 
In an interview, Jain attributed his success to his desire to “enhance patient safety ... and to that extent [my team and I] have contributed to the cause for making health care safe for everyone.” The Institute of Medicine has estimated that every year, 2 million patients in United States hospitals attain an infection that could have been contracted during a routine procedure, and about 100,000 of those people die from the infections.
MRSA, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus, is a pathogen that is one of the leading causes of those infections. This bacterium cannot be killed by a number of antibiotics, including penicillin and amoxicillin, and it causes excruciating pain, suffering, and death. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this so called “superbug” kills more people each year than AIDS, and is rapidly taking its place among the nation’s most shocking health threats. The cost for treating such infections is also quite high. 
Jain and his team have proven that such a dangerous infection can be easily prevented. In an interview, he explained that his program, called the MRSA Bundle, involved four steps: Hand Hygiene, Active Surveillance, Contact Precautions, and Cultural Transformation. These ideas are the core of the success of the MRSA program. Jain’s idea also coordinates handpicked front-line workers who review data weekly and report methods by which the infection is spread and how well it is being controlled.
At the reception held in honor of Jain’s award, he explained how “positive deviance” was responsible for making VA hospitals all over the country look at MRSA in the same way as VA Pittsburgh. Positive deviance is an approach to solving problems in which one member of a community acts as a “positive deviant” and has certain special abilities that, if adopted by other members of the community, would enable them to function more efficiently. VA Pittsburgh acted as the positive deviant in this case and the other VA hospitals adopted the techniques that were used effectively in Pittsburgh.   
In 2007, Jain and his team’s innovative program led three state legislatures to pass a groundbreaking bill that required hospitals to routinely test high-risk patients. Following these states’ examples, now 18 other states are necessitating published infection rates. Presently his program is being utilized in all 143 Veterans Affairs hospitals. Many of the speakers at the reception commented on the tremendous change that Jain’s efforts have brought about. Among the speakers was U.S. Congressman Tim Murphy, who exclaimed, “It is time for health care professionals to step up, and VA Pittsburgh is doing a tremendous job.” 
As he stood on the stage at the reception, Jain said, “I think the award should really go to the people [working in the hospitals] because, although we came up with the idea, they are the ones carrying it out every day.” The future for Jain and the MRSA program is very hopeful as he and his team continue to prevent infections. For Jain, the mission is still not complete, “Of course, our longterm goal is to reduce the occurrences [of infection] to zero,” he said.

Imagine a Caucasian speaking English with an exotic Chinese accent. Strange as it sounds, patients with the Foreign Accent Syndrome (FAS) do just this.FAS is a rare brain disorder often caused by a stroke, traumatic brain injury, or multiple lesions. Only around 50 cases have been reported since 1941. 
People with this syndrome speak their native languages with a foreign accent. FAS has been documented in cases around the world, and accent changes from Japanese to Korean, British to French, American English to British English, Spanish to Hungarian, and many more have been recorded.
According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, one of the earliest cases of FAS was recorded in Kirkenes, Norway in 1941. Astrid L., a 35-year-old woman who suffered from a severe head injury by shrapnel during an air raid, mysteriously adopted a strong German accent after her recovery and was greatly shunned by fellow Norwegians.
A recent case of the syndrome came about in 2008. CindyLou Romberg, who has never even left Port Angeles, Wash., developed an accent that could be from any number of exotic countries in the world. According to an interview conducted by ABC News, Romberg sometimes “rolls her R’s like a Russian, chops her syllables like a German, or turns an unsuspecting W into a V like a Swede.”
Romberg also shared her experiences on Good Morning America, and recounted that when she was in the grocery store, people would go up to her and say, “Oh you have a beautiful accent. Where are you from?”
At first an enigma, recent studies and investigations have shed some light on FAS and its underlying mechanisms. The human brain is divided in two halves: the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere. However, unlike our pairs of eyes and legs, the right and left hemispheres of the brain have different functions and roles. While the right hemisphere of the brain deals more with the visual activities and has a vital role in processing information, the left hemisphere deals more with language and has a significant role in analyzing information that is given to the brain. 
Therefore, it is not surprising that researchers found that most cases of FAS were associated with lesions to the left hemisphere of the brain. More specifically, patients usually have damage in the Broca’s area, the motor strip adjacent and inferior to the Broca’s area region, and/or the middle frontal gyrus.
In addition to the knowledge of the functions of the different parts of the human brain, a pattern found in all the patients was an important piece to solve the puzzle of the mysterious FAS. According to a review article in the Journal of Neurolinguistics written by a group of phoneticians who listened to the FAS patients, the patients’ speech “does not consistently resemble a foreign dialect.” 
Instead, it fluctuates in its similarity to a wide variety of languages, and even to different families of languages. Therefore, the name “Foreign Accent Syndrome” may be a misnomer. The patients, in fact, perform continuous alterations in linguistic prosody — the rhythm or tone of speech — that untrained ears generally mislabel as a different dialect or accent.
Thus, patients of FAS adopt their “foreign accents” due to a disruption in the ability to carry out variations in linguistic prosody, such as syllable length, vowel production, and pitch of speech. As stated earlier, the inability to produce these variations is often the result of damage in the Broca’s area.  
This damage could also lead to Broca’s aphasia, which causes people to have trouble performing the motor or output aspects of speech.

Mutation increases heart disease risk
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the world. Around 60 million people worldwide carry a heart disease mutation that, according to a study, is most common among people in India. In fact, by 2010, researchers have estimated that India alone will have 60 percent of the world’s heart disease cases.
The mutation is a deletion of 25 bases of the genetic code from MYBPC3, the heart protein gene that was found in two Indian families five years ago. The mutation results in an enlargement or thickening of the heart muscle that weakens it by reducing its ability to pump blood. The symptoms usually become more prominent in the middle age and can cause sudden cardiac death.
Genetic screening can help identify the mutation gene at a younger age so that it can be possible to develop drugs to correct the mutation.

Mono still prevalent among students
Although Mononucleosis, or the “kissing disease,” has been common for a long time, a definite cure or vaccine for the disease still does not exist. Mono is spread by close contact and has symptoms such as fever and severe fatigue. 
Since mono is such a common disease, experts feel that it has not received the importance it deserves.
There is still no vaccine or drug that can combat the Epstein-Barr virus, the herpes virus that causes mono. Doctors have prescribed steroids to patients with mono. The body can never actually get rid of the Epstein-Barr virus, which makes it difficult to find a drug that goes into the cells to treat the virus. Hank Balfour, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Minnesota, is optimistic about a new antiviral drug called “valomaciclovir” that may help patients recover faster.

Family abuses dementia patients
There are about 24 million people worldwide who have symptoms like memory loss and problems with orientation that lead to several forms of dementia. Researchers have concluded that people caring for family members with dementia often abuse them by shouting and swearing.
The study, reported in the British Medical Journal, found that a third of the people abusing their family member said that their abuse was significant, in some cases even physical. This abuse is causing some patients with dementia to forget their loved ones.

Clean air increases life expectancy
Cleaner air has caused a five-month boost in the average life expectancy in the United States. The study, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, was conducted by researchers from Brigham Young University and the Harvard School of Public Health.
The researchers say that this is the first study that has shown this increase of a few months in average life expectancy. Since 1978, the average life span has increased almost three years and at least five months can be attributed to cleaner air.

New worm plagues computers
A new worm has infected nearly 9 million personal computers around the world in what experts claim to be the worst infection since 2003. Computer security experts believe that the worm is the first step of a multistage attack and as yet have no idea who programmed the worm.
The worm, named Conficker or Downadup, has spread because of a newly discovered weakness in Microsoft’s Windows operating system. It spreads through portable devices like USB flashdrives and by figuring out network passwords. This worm is capable of causing infected computers to form botnets, which are systems that can be controlled by a remote user. The worm could, thus, cause infected computers to send spam, infect other computers, or enable the remote controller to get a hold of the user’s personal information.

Antarctica faces global warming
Recent research shows that Antarctica has been steadily warming over the last 50 years at almost the same rate as the rest of the world. This finding contradicts previous belief that although the rest of the world was getting warmer, Antarctica was actually getting cooler. The eastern part of Antarctica is getting cooler, but the western part is getting warmer. Since the warming is greater than the cooling, the net effect is that Antarctica has become warmer over the past few years.
The study, published in the journal Nature, reported that the warming in West Antarctica was more than 0.1° Celsius over the past 50 years.

Japan sends satellite into space
On Friday, Japan launched a satellite for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions. Seven smaller satellites were also launched along with the bigger one. 
The H-2A rocket that was used for the launch was carrying the largest number of satellites ever used for a Japanese mission.
The large satellite will help scientists record carbon dioxide and methane densities from 56,000 locations on the earth. Through this launch, Japan seeks to contribute to the global effort of coping with climate change.

Forests deplete due to global warming
A new study claims that forests in the Pacific Northwest are diminishing twice as fast as they were 17 years ago. Scientists believe global warming to be the cause of this increased death rate of forests. Data for the study was collected over a period of 50 years from forests in Oregon, Washington, California, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and British Columbia. Of all the sites, California was found to have the largest tree death rate.
The study was conducted in forests that were up to 500 years old and increased death rates were found for trees of all ages. After ruling out a number of other possible causes for forest depletion, scientists narrowed down to global warming as the cause for the death of trees.

On Friday Jan. 23, artists Dara Greenwald and Josh MacPhee came to Carnegie Mellon University to introduce their new exhibit, Signs of Change: Social Movement Cultures 1960s to Now. Their work, going back almost five decades ago, displayed movements that ignited major change. From revolutions during the 1960s to ones that are still occuring today, social reform has been exhibited in many aspects of American culture, and Greenwald and MacPhee wove through a map of time with their poster and video depiction of these social changes.
Dara Greenwald is a media artist and a Ph.D. candidate in the electronic art department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Her areas of specialty include video/new media/performance, public/social art, and writing. 
Her co-curator, Josh MacPhee, is an artist, curator, and activist. He recently released a book titled Reproduce & Revolt (Soft Skull Press, 2008, co-edited with Favianna Rodriguez).
During its brief introduction to the upcoming piece, the audience was informed that there would be seven aspects to the exhibition. The exhibit opened with “Social Context: Understanding the social context of images is important.” During this section, we could see images that reflected important pieces to not only the curators, but history as well. An example of such a reflective piece was a film clip of people in Indonesia rising against the second president, Suharto, who opposed art. In the video, one man said that when you become more self-conscious, history becomes more important.
“History kept coming up as we did research. We had no idea [these posters] existed,” MacPhee stated, commenting on the numerous posters that came up during his search for more pieces to add to his work. One of the posters they displayed originated from South Africa. It read “*Eet geen outspan sinaasappelen pers geen zuid Afrikaan uit*,” which means “Do not consume Outspan oranges. Do not squeeze a South African,” with the image of a boy’s head being squeezed on a lemon squeezer. The poster represented a major movement: apartheid. Apartheid was the social and political policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by white minority governments in South Africa from 1948 to 1994. “Apartheid is not even on the radar for high school and college students, even though it [was] around until 1994,” said Greenwald.
“Autonomy: Social transformation that happens from the bottom up” was the second section introduced. At this point, the curators let everyone know that nothing in the show was contributed or produced by the government. By leaving out electoral materials, they wanted to show that “there are thousands of other ways people participate in political issues in their society.”
The third section, titled “Social Forms: All production is social and art is no exception,” included slides, posters, and a video of various struggles while we heard the lyrics of “Singing For Our Lives,” Holly Near’s song: “We are a gentle, angry people. Singing, singing for our lives.…” The impact a poster can have on someone or something is great, and MacPhee emphasized that a poster isn’t simply a poster. Production of posters is important “because in the act of making a poster or setting up camps, people build a relationship with each other.” This led into the upcoming pictures of people sitting at border camps speaking across border lines.
“Archives: Our collective history begins in the commons” is a section that deals with the topic of the origins of the posters. Some of the posters came from people who just happen to have had them in basements, and some came from museums. Others were found at institutions, but as the institutions wouldn’t allow them to be publicly displayed, they could not be a part of the exhibition. “Everyone should have access to this stuff,” said Greenwald. MacPhee commented that it was hard to save some of the posters. Some people don’t have enough money to maintain them and those who do have the money simply don’t have the will.
In “Movement as a Producer: Social movements redefine what it means to be an artist,” a poster depicts the Latin struggle with the saying “*Si Se Puede*” — meaning “yes we can.” The underlying meaning behind the heading of the section was determined by depicting “movements as producers rather than individuals,” said Greenwald. The Community Arts Project (CAP) in Cape Town, South Africa (1980s) had print shops that trained South Africans in concentration camps. The vast majority of these people weren’t artists, but some of them were activists. They took their knowledge and tried to spread it around the country, but some of these print shops were firebombed by the government. In the Nicaraguan Revolution of the 1970s, graffiti and street art became a way for the movement to express itself. In their art and posters, there was a picture of a little blue hat. According to MacPhee, that little blue hat has now become symbolic of the Nicaraguan resistance.
The sixth section was titled “Prefiguration: Marginal ideas often end up transforming our world.” One example of this is of the White Bicycle Plan of Amsterdam that was proposed by Luud Schimmelpenninck in the 1960s. It said that Amsterdam should produce white bikes that anyone could ride anywhere and leave it where they please, and anyone could then pick it up and ride it elsewhere. This community bicycle program was part of a movement for zero-carbon transportation. However, within the first month, many of the bicycles had been stolen or found by a nearby canal.
The last section was titled “Communication: Social movements try to harness the potential of all available communicative technologies.” MacPhee said that during the Civil Rights Movement, activists wanted to get bitten by dogs in order to get media coverage. A member of the audience seemed to dispute this and MacPhee restated his comment, and said that maybe they didn’t want to get bitten but they would purposely put themselves in situations that would be seen by those who had televisions. “Social movements have all different relations to media,” said MacPhee. He corroborated his statement with an introduction to an incident in Paris that occurred in Oct. 2003, where groups of people went into the subway station and by morning all of the advertisements had been destroyed. In the Institute for Applied Autonomy, Txtmob was created and protesters used it to get updates on what was going on. Txtmob was originally created for protesters of the Democratic National Convention and the Republican National Convention. Txtmob is now a mobile messaging service, still in use for sending messages to groups that belong to various topics.
The night concluded with many of the guests and the curators heading to the Miller Gallery in the Purnell Center for the Arts to view the exhibition. There were various posters from different eras on display along the walls of the gallery. The posters were of all colors, shapes, sizes, and creeds. Some had pictures, some were just words, but each of the posters told a different story and had a different meaningful contribution to the evolution of time and social interactions. MacPhee and Greenwald said that the selected pieces were ones that they felt were most important. They tried to come up with a balance of materials that would engage people and at the same time would be interesting in terms of historical context.
This exhibition has showed viewers all the different aspects of social change from different cultures and countries across the globe. There are various things that can be seen and interpreted from these images, posters, and videos, but it is up to those who are doing the viewing to derive meaning from these documents. During the question-and-answer section, an audience member asked what the ultimate goal of the collection of posters was, and MacPhee said that there were two answers: the Utopian answer is “total liberation and social transformation,” the real world answer is “just getting these things out of people’s basements.”
In the years to come, there will be many more events and movements that are catalysts for change. Maybe in the future, there will be an exhibition that displays movements that have revolutionized the current times and those to come.

The idea of self-sacrifice has long been associated with helping to make the planet greener, even in small ways. On a crusade to cut down on plastic shopping bags? Be prepared to fork over the cash for your slew of trendy canvas ones. Saddened by the amount of paper you throw away when the semester ends? Spend the time to haul boxes of it to the UC’s Green Room. 
What about saving the planet and having fun while doing it?
The sustainable clothing industry, a small, steadily-growing supplier of eco-friendly clothing, might just be the way to go. Jeff Fulmer, owner and founder of Bamboo U, a bamboo-based T-shirt shop, says that while the idea of sustainable clothing, let alone bamboo, might sound a little weird at first, it’s actually quite easy to get used to. 
“It’s a challenge getting people to know about it,” he commented, “since bamboo is well-known, but not known for clothing.”
Fulmer started Bamboo U last year after learning about how sustainable clothing was beginning to gain a foothold in the United States. Already a successful veteran of the T-shirt business, he decided it was time to try something new. 
At first glance, the T-shirts look just like their cotton counterparts, ranging in a variety of styles and colors, with one major difference: they’re softer, more comfortable, and much better for the environment than the common cotton variety. 
“I wanted to do something more positive, eco-friendly,” Fulmer said. He found that bamboo, the major component used in the T-shirts (the other is a small percentage of organically grown cotton), grows quickly and doesn’t require much tending. Some varieties can grow up to three feet in a day; the species needs nothing more than rainwater, and it can be grown all over the world. 
Bamboo plants regenerate themselves, so there’s no need for re-planting. On top of that, they even absorb more carbon-dioxide gas than an equivalent amount of trees. But, when it came down to the tried-and-true test of wearability, Fulmer reported that there was no competition. “When I felt it, it sort of sold me,” he admitted, laughing.  
While it’s possible to make the T-shirts completely out of bamboo, organic cotton is added to give the fabric some support. Fulmer explained that his company’s choice of 70 percent bamboo and 30 percent organic cotton was because T-shirts made completely from bamboo would feel more slippery than comfortable. 
Sure enough, the fabric is incredibly soft, much more breathable than the typical T-shirt’s. “It’s a little silkier, a little softer,” Fulmer mused, recalling that the bamboo in the fabric is what gives the shirts their unbelievably comfortable feel. Fulmer also revealed that Bamboo U has plans to expand from the T-shirt market into more varieties of casual wear, such as hoodies and super-soft sweatpants, that are perfect for lounging around in and that would be fun and feel good to wear around campus, as well as help to reduce carbon emissions.
“It’s an easy choice to make,” Fulmer said. “There’s no downside. I’m misquoting Kermit the Frog, but honestly, it’s easy being green.” The challenge, though, is getting people to be willing to change their spending habits and try out something new. Most people, when confronted with the idea of bamboo clothing, Fulmer recalled, thought that the fabric would be very rough and uncomfortable, when in fact it is the exact opposite. 
“People are so entrenching in their wearing habits. Try something new, even if it sounds weird, since it might be kind of fun,” said Fulmer. While the idea of bamboo clothing may still seem new and a little strange, Fulmer sees the sustainable clothing industry expanding in the years to come. People, he said, will be willing to try new things as they become more environmentally conscious. “In 10 years, everyone will wear bamboo,” Fulmer joked. “But, no, I won’t see King Cotton going away in my lifetime. There’ll be a long-term shift toward sustainable products.”
As more and more people take part in the movement to go green, it makes sense that creative ideas for lessening environmental impact will begin to spread. The challenge right now for green clothing, as Fulmer said, is for consumers to be a little adventurous and try something new.

Few would have thought it would be even remotely possible to write a 90-minute production about that crisis all women eventually have to go through — the period in a woman’s life commonly known as “The Change.”
But alas, it can be done, and rather brilliantly, too. “Four women at a lingerie sale with nothing in common but a black lace bra AND memory loss, hot flashes, night sweats and not enough sex, too much sex and more!” reads the synopsis of Menopause The Musical. In the play, a professional woman, a soap star, an earth mother, and a housewife from Iowa, all in the midst of menopause, meet in Bloomingdale’s. And for 90 minutes, the audience watches each of them go through the horrible ordeals of menopause. Horrible it may be for women in real life, but this musical’s goal is to turn menopause from “The Silent Passage” it has become into something that is known and talked about. They proclaim it is a perfectly natural passage that all women have to endure at some point, and at the same time, they raise issues concerning women’s health. Some of the proceeds from the show are donated toward research about ovarian cancer. The show has already raised $500,000 in its 2005-2006 tour.
The production is showing at the Byham Theater and is set entirely in Bloomingdale’s, with the action being played out between the four women alone. Staging wasn’t anything special or spectacular, but that certainly was not an issue, and by no means affected the overall production of the musical. In fact, such basic staging allowed for the audience to fully engage and appreciate the sheer hilarity and raw talent of Cynthia Jones (the professional woman), Cherie Price (the soap star), Ingrid Cole (the earth mother), and Carolynne Warren (the Iowan housewife). Sure, the script itself was funny, but it was, without a doubt, the talent of these women that really made the words come to life. From the reading of lines to the very, very funny facial expressions, little things turned a line’s worth from a giggle to a hearty, stomach-hurting, eye-watering laugh.
Now, as the show suggests, menopause is a rarely discussed topic, and there are times throughout the production where one may feel a little uneasy after the shock of a particularly honest line. But these awkward moments are quickly overcome as the cast bursts into song and dance with parodies of the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s. One particularly memorable parody was the changing of the lyrics of the Beach Boys classic “Good Vibrations” from “I’m pickin’ up good vibrations” to “She’s needing some good vibrations!” while the dotty Iowan housewife struts across the stage waving a large pink vibrator.
You can pretty much gather the tone of this particular musical as one that watches the womanly pains of hot flashes, memory loss, weight gain, wrinkles, and sagging. Another highlight is when “Puff the Magic Dragon” becomes “Puff My God, I’m Dragging!” as Warren drags herself across the stage in a fit of exhaustion, disgust, and disdain for her hanging flab and thunderous thighs.
Okay, so it’s maybe not one for the family, or the men, and it was pitiful to watch the handful of husbands and boyfriends who were dragged along by their enthusiastic wives and girlfriends. But it is definitely worth the watch for the female eye, regardless of age or experience with menopause.
Menopause The Musical is an extremely funny, fast-paced, upbeat production that has the entire audience in fits of laughter throughout.

Street Scene, produced by the School of Music, is not your common opera. This 1947 show, with music by Kurt Weill, highlights the poetic and ponderous words of the great Langston Hughes as the drama unfolds on the street of a downtown New York tenement. The story is adapted from the Pulitzer Prize-winning play by Elmer Rice. It is a drama of love, hatred, and jealousy that leads to an explosive and surprising climax. The School of Music has put on a fine production of this classic opera that includes Wagnerian, blues, jazz, and barbershop quartet styles of music.
Particularly poignant is the singing and acting of Ian Alexander McEuen, a junior music major, who plays Sam Kaplan, a geeky but soul-searching young love interest to the beautiful and ill-fated Rose Maurrant (played by senior music major Danielle Messina). With a vocal range that could often be heard over the occasional overwhelming orchestra volume, McEuen managed to make his message of duality between a socially awkward but inwardly soul-baring young man clear. McEuen, aware of the difficulties of expressing this split persona on stage, explains that he can “relate to Sam’s need to express himself through singing and poetry ... [since] I got through [a difficult] part of my life by discovering music.”
Although the saga takes place in New York City, its themes are relevant to all of humanity. Anna Maurrant, Rose’s mother, is convincingly conveyed by senior English and music double major Kelly Rubinsohn. A woman who struggles with her husband and who has become hardened and argumentative over the years, Anna has a fateful affair with the milkman, Sankey (played by junior music major Scott Wasserman).
Through her resounding voice and determined acting, Rubinsohn manages to appear lost in her character’s strife as her gossiping neighbors begin to spread rumors of her iniquity. Rubinsohn’s number with her young stage son, Willie (played by Joel Neely), was one heart-pounding moment of expression and emotion. Singing about how she can’t wait for her son to grow up to be a respectable man, Rubinsohn manages to mold herself into the persona of a conflicted but nurturing woman. She acts marvelously as she vocally describes who she wants her son to become and what her husband can no longer be to her. This is urban poetry presented in a way only Hughes can passionately and lyrically express.
When Frank Maurrant, performed with an intense flame of anger by senior humanities and arts major Nathaniel Krause, comes across his wife and her lover, rage and jealousy burst forth from him. This climactic scene was well-rehearsed as it ran in a logically sequenced order without becoming silly, as overtly dramatic scenes can sometimes become. Krause, with a beautifully deep voice, contributed to the success of the climactic scene and production in general with his passionate stage presence and ability to always appear on the edge of emotionally snapping. Maurrant’s principles of working hard and maintaining a moral life and household are in his family’s best interest, but his inability to control his alcoholism and jealousy prove to be his tragic flaws.
With such a serious drama comes the need for some serious comic relief. This theatrical rescue came in the form of a barbershop quartet-style number about the wonderful taste of ice cream. Leading the operatic and harmonically pleasing number is the Italian immigrant to America, Lippo Fiorentino, played by senior music major Shawn Mlynek. During this ensemble piece, the orchestra and the singers were able to find a balanced dynamic with each other and literally left the audience craving some ice cream.
The dance routine between Dick McGann, played by junior music major Timothy Ruff, and Mae Jones, performed by senior music major Ashley Batten, was another enjoyable escape from the heavy storyline. This moment was also  the highlight for the pit orchestra as they provided a big band-style swing number that was only enhanced by the choreography between Ruff and Batten.
With such timeless and human themes, Street Scene is as relevant today as it was in 1947. As McEuen states, “In Street Scene, resistance to change is presented almost as a tragic flaw. To view it in such a way is incredibly thought provoking in the present time ... as our country currently [is] going through an incredible change.” As McEuen has mentioned, change is truly an element necessary for peace and prosperity. The School of Music effectively expresses this sentiment through the thoughtful and dramatic production of a powerful American opera.

“Curry and Cumin: A Night of South East Asian Entertainment” was held last Friday night by Khalil’s restaurant on Baum Boulevard in Shadyside. Dalel Khalil, whose father originally bought the restaurant that has found a home in Oakland for nearly half a century, emceed the event, which featured a completely vegan buffet, an Indian dancer, Pakistani singing, and an exotic Middle Eastern belly dancer. And, needless to say, the “heat and flavor” brought to this event by the combination of so many different cultures was more than enough to guarantee a great evening for all who attended.
The food served at the restaurant encompasses all types of traditional Middle Eastern cuisine, and includes entrees like shish kabobs, lamb, and chicken. However, it is also a great stop for vegans and vegetarians as well. Upon arriving at Khalil’s, it was fairly obvious that the locale was not meant to handle the amount of people who had shown up for this festive event. The hospitality of the hosts was fantastic and the seating and greeting formalities took little time, despite the apparent overbooking of the event. Dalel Khalil recently wrote and published a book titled “From Veils to Thongs,” which offers a comedic yet practical look at balancing life with “one foot in the East and one in the West,” as Khalil put it. When asked about some reasons behind the multicultural event, Khalil said, “My family has always been very cultural and our mother especially taught us to be open to all cultures.”
One of the more unexpected experiences of the night involved the seating. A curtained-off area gave the appearance of cultural authenticity, until the guests were seated on the floor – due to the limited seats, the locale had become standing room only. A slight perturbance was the late start to the evening, which was scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. but didn’t actually start until about 8:40 p.m. This was explained by a fellow guest as living on “Indian time,” meaning things always run at least a half-hour late.
As most cultural events begin, food was served first. If the word vegan scares you away, this description should ease your fears. Appetizers of bread and hummus, and rice in grape leaves paved the way for the main buffet entrees of rice and sauce, fried veggies, salad, pumpkin kibi, and a delicious apple and crunchy noodle dish. The food was plentiful and despite what seemed to be an abundance of guests, they managed to never run out. The food was delicious, and even someone who is the furthest from being vegan would go back for seconds and thirds at the buffet. 
Easily the most entertaining aspect of the night was the dancing. Two young women, one performing a traditional Indian folk dance and another who belly danced for what seemed like ages, held their audience entranced for much of the night. The dancing was heated and fierce, and it seemed as if the women made the music work for them. They were truly the highlight of the night and the dancing continued well into the evening as people kept wanting more.
On a more personal level, a break was brought to the evening’s festivities for Kamana Mathur, an immigration attorney who is founding a magazine titled The Pittsburgh Immigrant, which will focus on cultural happenings of all kinds in the city and is set to debut in March. In her address to the crowd, she explained, “I wanted to do something similar to what I did overseas ... helping communication between areas where there was little interaction.”
Overall, “Curry and Cumin” definitely gave more than it was expected to deliver. The food, entertainment, guests, and overall atmosphere of Khalil’s were all excellent. Khalil’s is conveniently located just a short walk down Morewood Avenue at 4757 Baum Blvd.

Janice N. Harrington’s book of poems, Even the hollow my body made is gone, is an important tale of music and memory. This chronicle, set on the brink of the Civil Rights movement, tells the story of Lillian, Webster, their children, and their grandchildren, a family living a meager life in the rural South more than 60 years ago. The book is split into five sections, some including one poem and others 12. All of the poems point to the author remembering and reflecting back to her childhood, as an adult. 
Throughout the book, the author utilizes repetition and alliteration to emphasize important themes, symbols, and motifs in her poems. The continued appearance of persimmon, catalpa, and kudzu trees, as well as crops like cotton and corn, display her connection with nature and how observant she is of her environment. The musical and lyrical quality of her work is expressed throughout the book, with the inclusion of song lyrics in poems like “The Thief’s Tabernacle” and “They All Sang.” She explores numerous topics from her perspectives as a girl and as an adult, and the poems reflect her growth. 
Harrington does not accommodate for the reader, using incredibly elevated language and allusions that address varied topics like pain, loss, death, and injustice, as well as lighter occurrences in the life of a Southern girl, like the afternoon on a swing, described in “Waiting.” Folklore and the labor that runs life weave themselves through this rich history and cultural account of the region of Alabama. Her rich, colloquial poems draw on both folklore and science, and are tributes to her weary but tenacious family in their journey North. This book does a splendid job of recounting and reanimating some tender and touching memories of the lives of her loved ones.
The first poem, “The Thief’s Tabernacle,” is an example that dictates the tone of the rest of the book. It encompasses all the other types of poems included in the book, using the italicized lines to present the lyric and musical quality present in many of the following poems. Harrington uses lofty vocabulary like “wan,” “penitent,” “purloin,” “avarice,” and “nectarous,” all of which display her prowess with nouns and verbs to describe very specific images. She is almost encouraging the reader to consult the dictionary and look up these words. She notes nature, acknowledging animals when she mentions the “bellies of white-tailed deer,” and science when she mentions “protons.” In the same stanza, the allusion to “Cantor’s infinities,” a mathematician’s controversial and philosophical arithmetic concept, displays how her references include things from all realms of academia. With eight stanzas forming a hypothetical question, she still questions the reader’s morals, asking, “will you forgive me?” This internal probing is what the rest of the poems that follow tend to do, encouraging the readers to take an introspective look and evaluate themselves.
The poem titled “Shaking the Grass” is an interesting close to the book, and her wondering about, “maybe I did no more than swallow deep/deep breaths/and spill them out into a story” is a concern I think all writers of any type can identify with. The repetition of the phrase “all is vanity” suggests to the reader that her superfluous wonderings are conceited, or they might allude to the quite popular optical illusion drawing of the same name by Charles Allan Gilbert, an American illustrator, lauded for his stunning realism, style, and exquisite detail. Harrington might want to be compared to this interesting artist.
“Ash” is a 12-couplet poem, using alliteration to detail a very intimate moment between Lillian and the author. Phrases like “sifted snow,” “sallow feet shining,” “red roses,” “comet-cinders, cast out,” and “briefly bright” all allow the readers to see Harrington’s attention to detail, also displaying the emotion in the scene, and the caring displayed by how they were “banked beside” one another. Lillian and the author are waiting for the “colored serviceman/who belonged to us,” to come and rescue them out of the snowstorm that has trapped them in their house “as slanted as a cant of snow.” This simile allows her audience into this fond memory of piercing cold and poignant time together. “Heat” is a poem that repeats the phrase “cast iron” as an adjective for heavy and hard, to symbolize strength and sass.

Cities have long been an object of fascination for poets, writers, artists, even the people walking their streets and populating them. It is something indefinable about them, perhaps, that has captured the words and thoughts of so many, and it appears that for every stage of development for cities, from the classical era through the slow rise of industrialization, a new voice emerges to write about them.
Priscilla Sneff’s O Wooly City is a look at cities today. It is not a collection of poems inspired by the grandeur of old cities, although older cities make their appearance, but it instead presents a new mythology of the present city. As its title suggests, O Wooly City is at once sweeping and grand, whimsical and lyric, and is both a musing and a bold address to something much bigger than itself.
Sneff starts the chapbook with “New Science,” a poem that sets the tone for her collection in many ways. In her verse, she draws information from many different sources. The view of the poem is constantly shifting from one passing idea to the next, all running along a common theme of knowledge, but always transient, like the very thing that she’s trying to find out more about is always that extra step beyond her grasp: “*Here begins a new science*. Bells stirring their metal tongues,/ Bending their savvy vowels around buildings — Hooey, Hooey, — / Sounding us out. Oh, the city is finding us out,...”
Sneff’s poems are, in essence, a tempting puzzle for the reader. She works riddles and clues into the meaning of her words and her arrangements, expressing vivid images without over-burdening the reader with wordiness. She chooses precisely the right words to convey her meaning, as well as leaves a lyrical treat for her listener.
In “The Daimon,” her description of a shade not only portrays its nature with words, but also with the consonant sounds she incorporates: “...soft shadow/ of smeared ink, confection of dark air.” She combines soft, easy sounds with rough ones to produce the alternately smooth and jagged edges of the shadow and leaves the description hanging over two lines to emphasize how this shadow is itself hanging over someone.
Sneff shows that good poetry need not rhyme constantly. When Sneff does rhyme, the reader gets a sense that it’s to create a resonance within the line, rather than accent it at the end. Her musical composition and placement of the other, non-rhyming words is really what gives her poems rhythm and flow. It is almost as though rhyme has become some add-on, a flourish, that Sneff only wishes to employ on special occasions. In “Chance Become My Science,” a title which itself is very rhythmic, Sneff employs this to great effect. “...and I have/ Loved this life as an experiment — an act of science/ And an act of ruth — I’ve kept for this city my last half heart/ (I lost the other to the chance of art). And so, stirred of a loud silence, [...]”
The weak rhyme in “science” and “silence” gently joins the lines together, but, interestingly enough, what Sneff stresses with the stronger rhyme between “heart” and “art” is the connection that stretches across half a line. It sounds like a gentle rebuff, a light, clip explanation, instead of the weightier implications that it would take on being at the end of the line.
Throughout the book, it becomes apparent that Sneff likes to have fun with the words she writes. In “O Wooly City,” the titular poem, she writes, “Where love’s brooklike dagger shivers. Drat love’s daggery thirst./ And drat this wooliness: I promise you that there’ll be facts/ But many other things are, City, necessary first...”
She playa with an appearance of the dagger, curving, winding down toward the blade like a river, and then with how love itself is like a dagger, a weapon always thirsty and, in this case, always painful. Her “wooliness” is exactly the opposite of what she was doing in “New Science.” The goal is still to acquire knowledge  — facts — but she says that there are other things, untruths that must come first before the matter of fact is discussed. It seems oxymoronic at first, and leaves one to wonder if the narrator is a foolish person or just sees something else that no one else does: that sometimes the imaginary is just as important as the real.
O Wooly City by Priscilla Sneff can be found at Hunt Library.

Notorious, directed by George Tillman Jr., is the story of the life and death of legendary hip-hop rapper Christopher “Notorious B.I.G.” Wallace, also known as Biggie Smalls. This film not only explores his career, but also examines his childhood, personal relationships, and children. Notorious has an episodic plot, which makes the film choppy in some points, and there are some acting glitches, but these things do not make the story any less entertaining.
In the film, young Biggie is played by Biggie’s real-life son, Christopher Wallace Jr. He bears a strong resemblance to his father. Biggie’s mother, Voletta Wallace, is played by well-known actress Angela Bassett. 
Though Bassett’s acting is polished as always, it is disappointing that throughout Notorious she has difficulty maintaining a Jamaican accent. Once Biggie ages, he is portrayed by Jamal Woolard, who makes his on-screen debut with this film.
Notorious begins with young Biggie and his mother walking down a block in their Brooklyn, N.Y. neighborhood discussing his good grades. Waiting for them at their door is his father, whom Biggie has never met before. After realizing the type of man his father is and how his mother struggles to support them, the audience is shown Biggie’s quick transition from good student to drug dealer.
Throughout the film, we see a number of episodes that contribute to the man that Biggie eventually becomes. As a teen, his girlfriend (Julia Pace Mitchell) gets pregnant, and shortly thereafter Biggie is arrested for selling crack. While in jail, he works on his rapping, which he always considered just a hobby. 
After being released, word gets around Brooklyn that Biggie has talent. Biggie’s life changes when he meets Sean “Puffy” Combs (Derek Luke). Luke does an outstanding job of portraying Puffy through his delivery of dialogue, physicality, and overall persona. His acting steals the camera, lighting up the screen.
Once Puffy launches Bad Boy Entertainment, Biggie is his leading man. Creating hit after hit, Biggie becomes a ladies man. He has a tumultuous relationship with on-again, off-again girlfriend Lil’ Kim (Naturi Naughton), who he brings into Bad Boy Entertainment, and impulsively marries Faith Evans (Antonique Smith), a singer for his label. Even with Faith becoming pregnant, this marriage does not last too long due to Biggie’s infidelity.
Toward the end of Notorious, Biggie reaches what will be the peak of his short career. The East Coast-West Coast rivalry between Death Row Records and Bad Boy Entertainment erupts, eventually leading to Biggie’s murder.
Notorious can certainly be categorized with films like Get Rich or Die Tryin’ and 8 Mile. This story does have a special flare as it gives Biggie, one of the most well-known rappers in history, more of a personality and not just a name and a voice. Audiences are able to witness what type of man he started as, what type of man he became, and all that transpired in between. In the words of Biggie, “We can’t change the world unless we change ourselves.”

New Orleans, perhaps more than any other American city, is a tottering coat rack of clichés. We hang all manner of cultural labels on the same rickety skeleton, some of them old and tobacco-stained, with holes in the elbows, others sleek and luxuriant, speaking to oily, Uptown affluence. Others still are flamboyant and rowdy, exploding with mismatched color. Jambalaya and Mardi Gras, jazz brunch and pirates, beignets and etouffée: there is no shortage of imagery the mere name of the place can conjure.
Well, I’m here to tell you that that rack of clichés is a lot like the coat check at a hot club. Sure, it holds a part of what’s happening inside, but it’s the least interesting, supervised part. In New Orleans, anyone with good sense scoots past the rack and penetrates the dark corners to find real action — they escape Bourbon’s lurid neon for the malt and miasma of Bywater dives and soul sets at Mimi’s. They leave Emeril be and slurp turtle soup at Mandina’s. They ditch downtown casinos for an oyster loaf, dressed, at Domilice’s. And maybe, just maybe, they forego “When the Saints” at Preservation Hall for sounds uncoiling in the shadows of the underground. Maybe, if they’re brave and clever, they flee the tired labels and find Backporch Revolution — a label, for true!
Backporch Revolutionaries don’t play standards: they filet them. Geisterfahrer’s ethereal drones and Archipelago’s swampy idylls bloom like toxic gas, sweet and vagrant as Binx Bolling’s malaise. Potpie splinters classic rock and then braids the strands into fugal loops, like a cannibal weaving jump rope from his supper’s locks. Other artists on the label record within beer distillery tanks, their bedrooms, and dilapidated studios. The lot of these weird experiments are then released on CD-R and occasionally spun on college radio. It’s all decidedly post-coat rack.
So whether you make a pilgrimage for the Gras a fortnight hence or remain cloistered on campus, I’m telling you: don’t get stuck fingering the coat rack’s glut. Stumble (or click: www.backporchrevolution.com) your way to the back porch. That’s where the revolution awaits.

The date for the annual junior prom is announced for Feb. 22. This gives students enough time to prepare for the demanding dance schedule listed. The sequence begins with a two-step, followed by a waltz, followed by another two-step, and so on. Clearly, students of 1909 have not yet been exposed to the sultry three-step.

The computer science department is pushing for an autonomous department. Computer science rock star Herb Simon said that he would not push for the move, but he doesn’t find it “terribly objectionable.” Computotron 3700 feels differently, however. Both it and millions of other computers protest by making sure that Windows doesn’t work properly until Carnegie Mellon gets its own computer science department. The change occurred, but the protest still hasn’t stopped.

Applications surge up 19.2 percent. This, coupled with no intention to make the undergraduate class size larger, factors into making getting into Carnegie Mellon pretty close to impossible. A pre-college ambassador states that she knows girls who would “kill to get into the drama program.” Fortunately, murder is not a requirement for admission into Carnegie Mellon... yet.

Dear Joe,
My roommate has a computer that is worth a fortune. He’s somewhat of a jerk, and makes sure to remind me every day not to touch it. So of course I make sure to play on it all the time. The problem is that I recently spilled a bottle of water on the keyboard (one of those unreasonably expensive ones). When he came back, I blamed it on the weird kid down the hall. I feel guilty, and need some solace.
—Ruined in Resnik
Dear Ruined,
You need solace? What about that poor soul who’s taking all the heat? He already has to deal with sanitizing his Pog collection and reading the Goosebumps series for the 18th time, and now he has to deal with this? Shame on you, Ruined. You should know better. It can be a pain when someone declares their stuff as hands-off. Most of us strive toward a world where we can roam in desk cabinets and refrigerators without fear.
But we must face the facts: all of us have things that we’d rather not have people touch. Personally, I cringe every time someone lays their filthy hands on my golf clubs. Those things cost me an arm and a leg, yet somehow over half of all humans have an inexplicable need to whack the club head off the ground when testing them out. Getting back, though, you faulted big time, and now it’s time to own up to what you did. It’s not going to be easy. Your roommate may not talk to you for a long time, if ever. Frankly, if someone broke my driver, they’d be dead to me. What you did, however, isn’t just wrong. It’s a crime to not admit your fault. Pick a day (in the near future) when you’re feeling confident, and just let it out. And afterward, apologize to the weird kid for not taking the blame. To do so, however, you may need to learn a few words in Klingon.
’Fess up, 
Joe
Dear Joe,
I was waiting for lunch at the UC when I heard one of my friends saying some bad things about me. How do I respond to her trash talk?
—Scrutinized at Sequoia
Dear Scrutinized,
Given the setting of the situation, you should consider what your friend was going through before you take any action. Lunch at the UC is usually a stressful process. Shouted food numbers, cut lines, and ornery employees can make even that little old lady with the Scottie dog seem nasty. Maybe your friend was just venting over getting unwanted cheese on her burger. Also, look into what she said. Honestly, if she griped about something like “She can be so aggravating sometimes,” then I would let it pass. There isn’t a single person who’s never annoyed one of their friends. If, however, your friend is talking smack, then maybe it’s time for a confrontation.
A truly hurtful comment overheard from a friend probably means that other people are hearing the same news (or slander). If you don’t want your reputation to be smeared beyond repair, sometimes you have to do some cleaning. That means going right up to her and asking what’s wrong. You don’t have to turn it into a Jerry Springer episode. Avoid waving fingers and retaliatory insults. Also, don’t set up traps. By this, I mean driving her into suggesting that she didn’t say things about you, and declaring that she’s lying. One issue is enough. Just get to the point, state that you heard her, and ask why she would say such things. If she apologizes or explains why her comment was reasonable, then try to move on. In the other scenario, I again suggest the same thing. Move on. Just without her. The lesson from all this: if someone is driving you up a wall, call them out on it immediately.
Talk it out, 
Joe

For some, Tuesday’s presidential inauguration served as this generation’s version of a political Woodstock — only bigger, colder, and with less nudity (blame the weather). But temperatures of 30 degrees could not freeze the spirits of the crowd of 2 million who were present at the Capitol building, or as close as they could get, some of whom who had been waiting outside for nearly 24 hours, according to a Jan. 22 article in the Detroit Free Press.
The event has been deemed the largest gathering of people in North American history to date. An additional 38 million people watched the live televised broadcast, according to Yahoo! News. Washington did everything it could to maximize security measures and prepare for the crowds, which some news sources predicted could number up to 5 million, including installing several large television screens on which attendees could watch the proceedings and lining the mall with quantities of port-a-potties that regular outdoor concert-goers only dream about.
And 300 miles away in Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon students were able to witness history in the making, live, in three on-campus locations — Philip Chosky Theater in the Purnell Center, Alumni Concert Hall in CFA, and McConomy Auditorium in the University Center. In addition, the day’s proceedings were replayed in McConomy at 7 p.m. for all those who missed them the first time around.
“It was amazing, beyond words ... to describe the feeling that overcame me when it was announced that Barack Obama was now the president of the United States of America,” said first-year CIT student Elisha Clayton, who watched the ceremony on the projector in Purnell. “It was overwhelming, unbelievable, shocking, astonishing, pleasing, satisfying, extraordinary, history in the making.”
Other students expressed similar sentiments.
“While watching [Obama] take the oath, I felt proud that we have overcome in the sense that America as a whole could vote for someone that wasn’t a white male. For once we actually stand by our beliefs in America being an equal opportunity country,” said sophomore drama major Donovan Mitchell, who also watched the proceedings from the Philip Chosky Theater in Purnell.
In addition to those students on campus, a group of students in the Heinz College who are currently participating in the school’s Apprentice Program in Washington, D.C. this semester were able to attend the event.
“I felt very blessed to be alive at this point in history and physically here in D.C. at this time,” said Mark Rutledge, a Heinz master’s student in public policy and management who is participating in the program. “President Obama has proven that he can speak to the heart of every American’s hopes and dreams for themselves and their society. I truly believe that he will show that not only can he speak to those hopes and dreams, but can change our government to be a reliable partner with us as we make our hopes and dreams our everyday realities.”
Marie Coleman, executive director of the Heinz College’s Washington, D.C. office, said that she felt fortunate that the Heinz students could be present for the inauguration and to witness the shift in presidential administrations. “You can’t get a better learning experience,” Coleman stated via e-mail.
Appropriately, the inauguration fell the day after Martin Luther King Jr. Day, serving as a reminder to many of where the country has been and how far we have come. However, students also cautioned that the fight for equal rights is not over.
“I feel that Dr. King’s vision has come true, but we still have a ways to go. Obama being president was only the first; we have no clue if he will also be the last,” Mitchell said.
“Although 40 years later, after King stood on the mountaintop and delivered his ‘I Have A Dream’ speech, Obama has become the first African American in the White House to become president, that does not mean the dream has been fulfilled,” Clayton added. “We are still dreaming, yet the difference is that now we are seeing more of our dreams become reality.”
While he’s been in office for scarcely a week, Obama has already made some decisions that have set the tone for his administration. Internally, he has made a motion to increase transparency in government and has already frozen salaries in the White House. Externally, he has signed the first of four documents to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay in less than a year and reversed the Bush administration’s ban on giving federal funds to international women’s health organizations that perform abortions.
Coleman agreed that Obama has helped the country realize the dream of Martin Luther King Jr., but also that it is Obama’s individual gifts that will allow him to be a successful leader in the future.
“Beyond being the first African American president, I think that Obama has a way of reaching out to many more types of people, [and] that is probably what made him an effective candidate,” Coleman said. “He is half black, but also half white, of a foreign-born parent, lived abroad ... there are so many ways people can relate to him. He is also an effective communicator and has a way of engaging and bringing people together.”

Carnegie Mellon’s Qatar campus just got closer.
 This spring semester, the history department in the School of Humanities and Social Sciences is offering a class taught simultaneously on the University’s Pittsburgh and Qatar campuses, linked by live videoconference. Titled “Inward Odyssey: Travelogues as Windows into World History,” the discussion-based course will give students a unique opportunity to interact with their counterparts in Qatar.
“Inward Odyssey” will examine world travelers’ writings from ancient times to the present. Intended to overlap with “Introduction to World History,” “Islam and the European World,” and “US-Arab Encounters,” students will explore world history by examining it through the eyes of travel writers as diverse as Marco Polo, Mark Twain, and Mourid Barghout, as well as their Qatari peers.
“It deepens the sense of an ‘Odyssey’-like experience,” reflecting the cross-cultural experience of writers studied in the course, said Peter Gilmore, a Carnegie Mellon Ph.D. student in history and the “Inward Odyssey” Pittsburgh administrator.
“It’s shocking to today’s Islamic students how different Islam was hundreds of years ago” when Islam put a greater emphasis on many traits it shared with Christianity, such as pilgrimage and sainthood, said Benjamin Reilly, a visiting assistant professor of history at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar. He added, “We also want to teach students skills like essay writing and documentary analysis.”
The course breaks new technological ground for history courses at Carnegie Mellon. 
It will be the department’s first class taught simultaneously on both campuses since Carnegie Mellon’s Qatar campus opened in 2004. 
Georgetown, Cornell, and several other American universities also have satellite campuses in Doha’s 2400-acre Education City. 
They are part of a growing group of elite American universities that have established footprints in distant locales.
“Main campus reputations can be horribly damaged by branch campuses without the academic strengths of the home campuses; MIT was notorious 10 or 20 years ago for weak satellite campuses,” said Reilly.
Money could be compensating for previous deficiencies in similar satellite programs. College officials from universities with similar satellite campuses told the Christian Science Monitor in a Feb. 22, 2007 article that professors garner 25 to 40 percent higher salaries in Qatar’s Education City.
A sign of the student body’s strength came this week when the school sent a team to the World Universities Debating Championships in Cork, Ireland, according to a Jan. 18 Cornell University Weill School of Medicine in Qatar press release. Reilly and Gilmore stressed the potential of videoconference courses like “Inward Odyssey” to highlight the branch system’s strengths.
“Courses like this maximize the benefits and minimize risks,” said Gilmore.
Professor Reilly planned the course based on the recommendation of Carnegie Mellon University Provost Indira Nair.
Nair taught a similar course in Arab and American encounters last year. Reilly will lecture and moderate discussions from Qatar while Gilmore will administer the course from the Pittsburgh classroom.
“There’s still an awkwardness leaning into the microphone making eye contact. On the other hand, there have been some playful exchanges of [the game] Marco Polo across 7000 miles, and there is now a Facebook group,” Reilly said. “There is nothing particularly shy about the Qatari students.”
Along with readings and discussion, students can expect to experience themes from historical Western-Arab encounters in real time, thanks to the course’s innovative web-based platform.
“It’s all about shifting perceptions of visitor and visiting,” said Gilmore.
To accommodate the time difference between Pittsburgh and Qatar, the class meets between 8 a.m. and 9:20 a.m. Mondays and Wednesdays.

The University Bookstore is not immune to the nation’s economic crisis — the high price of textbooks at the on-campus store has been one of the most recent student complaints.
The issue was the focus of the Student Senate Spotlight Series this past Thursday. 
Students, faculty, and staff gathered with the Undergraduate Student Senate and Graduate Student Assembly to discuss the matter with Allison Heinemen, manager of the University Bookstore.
Heinemen shared the reasons behind the current prices and also asked students for any suggestions they might have to better the store’s service to the campus needs.
She began her talk explaining the very small role the bookstore has in setting textbook prices. She explained that the bookstore predominantly orders from four new and eight used vendors, all of which send the books with a predetermined price.
The typical protocol for used books is to sell them at 75 percent of the original price, and buy them back for 50 percent of the original price.
Several students brought up concerns that ordering books online through websites like Amazon.com is much cheaper than the bookstore.
Heinemen replied that when ordering the books en masse through vendors, this is not a possibility.
She mentioned, however, that despite seemingly high book prices, the bookstore’s direct profit from their sales is a significantly small percent. 
For each dollar the bookstore makes, it gains only 4 cents in direct profit after taking out salaries, rent, operating costs, and other necessities.
“Whenever we do get deals [on the prices], we bring them straight to you,” she said.
According to bookstore data, last December’s textbook buy-back was able to give students 2.5 times more back for their books than they had for the previous semester.
Several students offered up suggestions for improving textbook buy-back, including buying books back for prices proportional to their condition.
Textbook buy-back was not the only area of concern, however. 
A number of students expressed concerns with the one-week return period after the first day of classes and suggested extending the time to two weeks.
“A few years ago, we did have a two-week period,” Heinemen said. “[However], when people started buying books online, they started using us as a lending library until their books came in the mail.”
Heinemen said that to check why students are returning books, the bookstore has begun to make students fill out surveys upon book return asking for their reasoning.
Jared Itkowitz, student body president and junior business administration and Chinese studies double major, proposed a specific suggestion. 
“If students return the books in the one-week period, they can get full price. If they return it within two weeks, they get back full price minus ten percent to cover store costs for the extra week,” he said.
Another idea mentioned was a semester-long textbook rental system. 
“We have not tried that model here but I know that some schools are heading in that direction,” Heinemen said. “The thing with that model is that professors would have to choose a version that would stay for a few years.”
Heinemen said that she would follow up on all the student ideas with the bookstore staff.
She mentioned that an obstacle in any plan, however, is the lack of timeliness on the part of some professors for submitting the books they needed.
“Should they be meeting deadlines so that we get more used books?” asked Rotimi Abimbola, a junior social and decision sciences major and Student Senate chair.
Although this semester’s deadline was Nov. 7, she estimated that only 30 percent of professors were on time. She said that departments varied in meeting the deadline, with the entire chemistry department on time, but with Tepper having a majority of their faculty being late.
Heinemen ended her talk on an optimistic note, ensuring students that she would take their suggestions to the bookstore staff and keep them updated on the progress. 
She assured the student body that despite the nation’s economic troubles, the bookstore was in no immediate danger.
“We’re treading water right now, but I see the way that trends are going. I know that a lot of businesses are suffering, but we’re not anywhere near going out of business. I just want to make sure we’re satisfying the needs of the campus.”
Abimbola mentioned the existence of the University Bookstore Student Advisory Council.  She encouraged  students who are passionate about this issue to join.

A recent study published by professors Richard Roman, Dennis Epple, and Holger Sieg at the Tepper School of Business shows that a universal ban on affirmative action would decrease minority presence by 35 percent at top-tier colleges and universities like Carnegie Mellon.
“In recent years, court decisions have limited discretion of colleges to pursue affirmative action policies. In addition, several states have imposed restrictions on use of affirmative action. Our objective was to investigate what effect such restrictions would have on financial aid policies and on the racial composition of colleges and universities,” explained Epple.
“We developed a model to characterize decision making by colleges and universities and a model of student choice among colleges and universities.... We then used that model to study the effects of potential changes in policies,” he said.
The model looked at both admissions and financial aid policies to examine specifically the role affirmative action plays in building a minority presence at a particular school.
“We predict that the effects of a ban on affirmative action would be a substantial reduction in minority enrollment at the top tier of colleges and universities and an increase in minority enrollment in lower tier institutions,” concluded Epple. “The latter result at first appears surprising, but it is a consequence of the reduced access of minority students to top tier institutions.”
Affirmative action has recently become a very controversial and often political issue. 
While its supporters believe it is needed to help minorities overcome ethnic barriers, its critics argue it detracts from the significance of other academic merits and achievements.
“Affirmative action policies confront us with an uneasy tradeoff,” Epple said.
In an ideal world, affirmative action would neither be needed nor permitted. 
As our results show, however, an outright ban on affirmative action is likely to result in a significant reduction in attendance by minority students in top-tier colleges and universities.”
However, Epple insists that his study was not intended to contribute to any side of the debate. “The broader implications for society ... is a subject of much research and debate, but it is not the question that our study was designed to answer.”
Nevertheless, some students take issue with the implications the study seems to make on the qualifications of many currently enrolled undergraduates.
“Maybe this percentage is true, and we’ll see the effects if and when affirmative action is repealed,” said first-year biological sciences major Turi Alcoser, who identifies as Mexican-American. 
“I have a righteous mind that is capable of solving the same math equations or physics problems as any other Carnegie Mellon student. 
It would be a shame to attribute my enrollment on the sole basis of affirmative action, and I wouldn’t feel any different four years from now when I’m receiving my diploma.”
But regardless of any perceived magnitude of affirmative action’s role in admission and financial aid, minority students currently make up on average 14 percent of the student bodies at the top-tier colleges and universities, and Carnegie Mellon has a 10 percent minority undergraduate enrollment. 
President Jared Cohon has indicated his support for increasing diversity across campus in his annual diversity advisory report, saying, “community success and diversity have remained as university priorities, reaffirming our commitment to create an inclusive, rewarding, and collaborative environment that enables all of us to reach our fullest potential while advancing the university’s mission and values.”
Epple also remains hopeful, saying, “Carnegie Mellon has been a leader and innovator in developing and employing objective criteria for admission and financial aid decisions that support the mission of the university. I expect that the university will now play a similar role in developing procedures to apply the criterion of holistic review in a sensible way.”

The rapidly dropping temperature has brought out scarves, hats, and gloves, as well as the sniffles. 
Many students are actively trying not to catch the common cold, and while dressing warmly is important, new research conducted by Sheldon Cohen, a professor in the psychology department, shows that students may need to sleep more to fight off coughing and aching.
For the last 25 years, Cohen has been studying the effects of stress and social support systems on one’s health and susceptibility to infectious diseases.
In the past years, Cohen’s work on the role of psychosocial factors in vulnerability to the common cold has been published in the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Cohen has gotten results about the effects of sleep on catching a cold. In his study, there were 153 healthy volunteers between the ages of 22 and 55. 
For two weeks prior to the experiment, the 78 men and 75 women were interviewed daily about the quality of their sleep on the previous night.
The volunteers were then exposed to a cold virus and sequestered in a hotel for five days. 
During this time, the volunteers were carefully monitored and checked for signs of certain cold-related symptoms like sneezing, nasal congestion, sore throat, and coughing.
Of the 153 volunteers, 54 showed the symptoms of a cold.
The study looked at two aspects of sleep: sleep duration and sleep efficiency. 
Cohen observed that in terms of sleep duration, or how long one sleeps, the people who reported fewer than seven hours were 2.94 times more likely to develop the symptoms of a cold than those who reported eight or more hours of sleep.
In terms of sleep efficiency, which is measured in the percentage of time one actually sleeps between lying down to go to bed and waking up the next morning, Cohen found that those with an efficiency score of less than 92 percent were five and a half times more likely to develop colds than those with efficiency scores of 98 percent or higher.
“Feeling rested” did not correlate with developing a cold. 
Other variables in the study that could have impacted the results, such as smoking, stress, mental health issues, and depression were carefully screened before allowing the volunteers acceptance into the study.
When asked why sleep plays such an important role in our vulnerability to the common cold, Cohen replied that this is “probably because it influences our immune system’s response to infection. Specifically, those with poor sleeping habits produce too many inflammatory chemicals, causing many of the symptoms of a cold.”
What surprised Cohen most about his results was “how small differences in both duration and efficiency of sleep were associated with relatively big increases in the risk of getting colds.”
“I definitely agree that how much sleep a person gets affects how likely it is that he gets sick,” said first-year creative writing major Katie Dickson. “I’ve experienced this firsthand. I feel like every time I’ve been sick, it was during a period of time when I was severely sleep-deprived.”
First-year history major Nancy Brown said that she was surprised by how much more likely students who don’t get enough sleep are to catch a cold than those who do sleep eight or more hours a night.
“I always try to go to sleep at regular hours, because I’ve experienced that when I don’t get enough sleep, or when I’m restless during the night, I feel the symptoms of diseases like a cold the next day,” Brown said.
Cohen has studied the effects of sleep on catching a cold and has also found some enduring stressors, “especially those that derive from ongoing social conflicts,” such as a bad marriage or a bad work situation. 
These factors can also influence a person’s likelihood of becoming infected with the cold.
He has found that having a diverse social network, such as having good relationships with family, social groups, or church, reduces one’s risk of getting sick. 
Cohen stated that more enthusiastic and upbeat people tend to have reduced risk.
To help Carnegie Mellon students fight the cold in Pittsburgh’s weather, Cohen suggests that students take steps to improve their overall health, including getting regular exercise, avoiding smoking, and developing regular sleeping habits, as well consuming the recommended amounts of Vitamin C.

Randy Pausch’s legacy lives on. 
As a result of his New York Times best-selling book, The Last Lecture: Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams, which is based on his final lecture at Carnegie Mellon, Pausch has been featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show and ABC News.
Most recently, his story has been featured on ESPN.
The longest-running sports series on television, NFL Films Presents, aired a segment spotlighting Pausch, which ran on ESPN, the NFL Network, and NFL.com over the winter break. 
Footage of Pausch giving his last lecture at Carnegie Mellon was featured, focusing on the part when he talked about his childhood dream of playing in the National Football League.
Although Pausch remembers he was the smallest person on his childhood football team, he recollects that the most important things he learned from his years on the football field, the place where he felt the most comfortable even in his adult years, were teamwork, sportsmanship, and perseverance.
“Randy taught many things, but most importantly the process to success,” said Kerry Handron, a former colleague of Pausch’s at the Entertainment Technology Center, upon watching the clip.
NFL Films wanted to illustrate this process to show that mastering the fundamentals of a craft is essential before centralizing on the “fancy stuff” as Pausch conveys.
J.J. West, an executive at ESPN, recalled, “for me, The Last Lecture has sharpened my desire to do more with my life and has reminded me to continue to dream big because anything is possible.... Pausch’s mantra: ‘Don’t Complain, Just Work Harder’ because ‘complaining does not work as a strategy’ is a quote which is commonly used in sports but applies to everyday life. We thought sports fanatics could learn a lot from Pausch about putting things in perspective and reflecting on what’s most important in life.”
Pausch never played professional football, but he did get to suit up with the Pittsburgh Steelers, his favorite team, before he died. In his last lecture, Pausch said, “I did not make it to the National Football League, but some things you’re not going to do, so maybe you just want to stand close to the people ... If I didn’t get the dream of playing in the NFL, that’s okay, I probably got stuff more valuable.”
Pausch’s segment is scheduled to play several more times over the next few months on ESPN, the NFL network, and NFL.com, posthumously achieving his NFL dreams.

Carnegie Mellon’s Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) is participating in the first Global Game Jam.
A game jam is the term used to describe a game-building marathon.
The Global Game Jam will last for 48 hours, beginning Friday, Jan. 30 at 5 p.m. in Dunedin, New Zealand. Countries in 14 other time zones will be participating in the marathon, which will last until 5 p.m. Feb. 1.
Each participant in a new time zone will join the game jam at 5 p.m. local time; everyone is connected through the streaming videos on the Internet.
New participants joining the jam will not be informed of any time-sensitive information until they are officially part of the game jam marathon. The theme is not announced until the game jam begins, and for each time zone a special constraint is introduced to prevent any particular location from being advantageous.
Students at Carnegie Mellon can join the Global Game Jam because the Pittsburgh chapter of the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) is hosting one of the venues. In order to reserve a seat, there is a $10 fee, which also covers the cost of food.
An ETC alumnus, Kyle Gabler, will be keynoting the global event via Internet broadcasting.
For more information, visit the event website at (http://www.globalgamejam-pgh.com).
Carnegie Mellon’s School of Drama students get a week off from classes; however, their time will be spent in rehearsal for the highly-anticipated pieces performed in Playground: A Festival of Independent Student Work.
Playground gives drama students a chance to create, plan, organize, rehearse, and perform original or adapted pieces.
This week will also allow drama students to expand their creativity without the restrictions of a classroom.
Acting students will be able to direct pieces, directors can sing, dramaturgs can act, and any drama student can set up installations for the public to enjoy.
The performances range from one-man shows to musical pieces, all of which are open to the campus community for free.
Even students who are not in the School of Drama sometimes participate in Playground performances, whether behind the scenes as a writer or actually being on-stage.
Playground officially kicks off Thurs., Jan. 29 and continues until Sat., Jan. 31.
A list of performances can be found on the School of Drama website as well as inside the Purnell Center for the Arts, where all of the performances will be held. Tickets for all performances are available at the box office.

Politicians make a lot of promises during their campaigns. Out of a desire to be elected, they promise to lower taxes, improve  education, reduce crime, or improve the economy. These promises — and the winners who don’t keep them — have become commonplace in American politics.
Part of the reason that politicians are able to get away with not fulfilling their promises is that people can’t keep track of the promises candidates make. If people don’t remember the promises, then the politicians are off the hook. Barack Obama, however, might not be so lucky.
An Ideapalooza.com user has created a web page called the Barack Obama Promise Tracker. The creator painstakingly scoured all of Obama’s speeches and campaign plans to find all of his campaign promises — and he found them. All 895 of them. 
The Promise Tracker divides Obama’s promises into 37 different categories ranging from “First Day” promises to “Health Care” and “Foreign Policy” promises. Categories usually have subcategories within them, like “Administrative” and “Funding.” 
Users of the Promise Tracker can check boxes next to each promise once they believe Obama has either broken or kept it. Once a box is checked, the total tally and percentage of kept and broken promises is updated, allowing the user to keep track of how well Obama is doing.
Throughout Obama’s campaign, the issue of technology has been important and is often discussed as a sign of the changing times. In this case, too, we can see the positive impact of technology on the presidency specifically and politics in general.
The Promise Tracker is a great tool that allows Americans to hold politicians to their word. It allows Obama to be held accountable for all of his promises.
On the main page of the Promise Tracker, which is a macro-enabled Excel document, the author’s note reads: “This is meant to be an objective means of measuring the candidate’s sincerity and honesty.... This is early proof that this may indeed be the beginning of an era of new openness.” 
I think that here the creator is correct. A lot of good can come of being able to hold Obama — and future politicians — accountable for the promises made while campaigning. Too often, politicians make empty promises to garner votes, and once elected, those promises take a backseat to the politician’s real agenda.
Many politicians do keep some of their promises, but they are rarely held accountable for the ones they don’t keep. Americans have become too accepting of the idea that politicians won’t keep all of the promises they make while campaigning. They rarely hold candidates accountable for these promises, and instead focus on the promises that are kept by the politicians. 
With the Promise Tracker, though, Americans can keep a close watch on all of the campaign promises and hold Obama accountable for each and every one made. These promises did, after all, get him elected, and he owes it to the American people to at least attempt to fulfill every one.
This may help to change the ways in which American politics operates. If politicians are going to be held accountable for all of their promises, maybe they’ll be more careful about how many they make. Then, we’ll be able to judge the worth of the candidates without false promises swaying our opinions. 
As the Promise Tracker’s author said, this could be the beginning of a new period in American politics, one in which politicians are honest and open about their actions. If Obama seriously attempts to fulfill his promises, then maybe it will be proof that the American people chose the right man for the job; if he doesn’t, then maybe Americans will be more careful in the next election.
Aside from the Promise Tracker, there are many other places to check on the state of Obama’s campaign promises. Various websites are keeping track of them, and by some counts he’s already kept more than 10, an impressive feat for his first week.
While it remains to be seen whether Obama will fulfill the rest of his promises, it is clear that he’s off to a good start. It is unclear at this point whether Obama will be able to fulfill every promise, though; he only has four years, and there are pressing issues in this country that are more important than some of the promises he made during his campaign.
This presidency will be very important in setting the tone for the future. This is the first time that so many resources have been available to keep an eye on what the president is doing and whether he was sincere in his campaigning. Future presidential hopefuls may be scrutinized more closely during their campaigns, and campaigns may be more focused on plans for the future rather than on bashing the other candidate.
Regardless of whether Obama does keep his promises, the Promise Tracker will only do good things for American politics, allowing the American people to hold their politicians accountable for what they say and choose candidates based on the issues instead of false promises.

With over 1300 dead, of which about 65 percent were civilians, and at least 5000 wounded in Gaza, Israel has reason to form the war crime defense team they did on Saturday — they will certainly need it. This defense team will tout justifications at human rights organizations, hesitantly complaining Arab states, and probably even the U.S. as it merely waves a disapproving finger at its spoiled child’s uncontainable rampage at a bunch of civilians. And these justifications, without doubt, will be accepted by each of these groups, making the once-seething violence nothing but a blurred memory.
In other words, the creation of such a “defense team” is nothing but a formative aspect of this war season’s Israeli propaganda. The reasons why Israel will successfully wrestle itself free from the grip of international law are difficult to comprehend without the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The bloodbath that took place in the war-torn Gaza strip, a wretched maze of refugee camps and grit pathways situated in the Palestinian authority, is not a recent phenomenon, and neither are the rest of the contributing factors: the U.S. involvement, the laid-back attitude of Arab governments, and the escalating scale of Israeli propaganda. A new facet of this conflict, however, is this dramatic defensive attitude adopted by Israeli leaders. They believe they have made the right choices and acted in the best interests of their people. But it is obvious that Israel went overboard and used Hamas’ primitive shelling of rockets on southern Israel as an excuse to wage a war against Palestinian civilians. According to The New York Times, the Israeli rationale can be understood with the help of a newly popular Hebrew phrase: “*baal habayit hishtageya*” or “the boss has lost it.” Giori Eiland, former Israeli national security adviser, explained that the phrase means, “If our civilians are attacked by you, we are not going to respond in proportion but will use all means we have to cause you such damage that you will think twice in the future.”
One of the major events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the Balfour declaration by the British. This dual-faceted declaration was based upon the assurance of Palestinian freedom, but, on the other hand, pledged a commitment to the Zionist Federation, a private organization promoting the political movement to restore a “national home” for Jewish inhabitants in Palestine. Even though the Zionists did not trust the British, they inspired this short-term victory of a “national home” because they looked forward to influx of Jews from Germany, which they hoped would give the upper hand in Palestine. However, the Jewish people, a minority in the region, were left with Israel to call their own, thanks to the anti-Hitler Soviet Union.
Moreover, the fact that self-serving Arab leaders had given tacit consent to Hitler’s atrocities fueled Israeli anger and a desire for revenge against their Arab counterparts, leading to daily conflict in the region. In addition, the Arabs disagreed with the United Nations General Assembly’s 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, since it imposed massive iniquity upon the Palestinians, who were far greater in proportion to the Jews and were compelled to live as refugees in their own land. The Arab-Israeli war of 1948, initiated by Arabs, cost the lives of thousands of Palestinians and Israelis, but resulted in a larger Palestinian refugee count. 
As Holocaust survivors swarmed into Israel, Israelis gained U.S. sympathy and an edge over Palestinians. Eventually, the people of Palestine were forcibly uprooted and turned into refugees as hundreds of thousands of European Jews were flown in. Then, in 1967, Israel acted upon its earlier intentions and colonized Gaza, the West Bank, and the mountainous Golan Heights. What we see today is the continuation of Israel’s colonialist expansion that began almost four decades ago.
Therefore, the scathing remarks issued by the media on Israeli forces are not in vain — last month’s warfare was initiated by Hamas militants, who are shameless enough to consider this war a victory. The Hamas, even though they were Palestine’s first democratically elected government, took radical, extreme measures to sustain power at the expense of the civilians. The paradox is that the more radical people are made to feel, the more radical they actually become — a cruel form of a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Nevertheless, Israel’s response, just like its share of the Palestinian land, is dangerously disproportionate. In the name of national security, Israeli Defense Forces have avenged the deaths of eight Israelis by calculatedly killing or disabling thousands of Palestinians. By lashing out at Gaza, Israel crushed any possibility of peace between Palestine and Israel, unless those who were responsible for Israel’s war crimes are held accountable by international law. However, without any support from Arab states, most of whom would not dare risk their diplomatic relations with the U.S., justice for the Palestinian victims of war is highly unlikely.
Although some Arab countries were quick to donate billions of dollars to the reconstruction of Gaza, they are still divided over a sound reconstruction plan that none of them want to be directly associated with. Furthermore, Palestine is not recognized as a state nor is Hamas as a government — which makes this more of a civil conflict than an international crime. This places the reigns in the hands of Mahmoud Abbas, who is recognized by the U.S. as the President of Palestine, but who will never be foolish enough to officially accuse Israel of war crimes. So not only is Palestine at the brink of man-made disaster, it has nowhere to turn to for the help and rights deserved by its people. 
Emerging from 22 days of massacre by Israeli forces today, Gaza has seen more than the loss of thousands of innocent civilian lives. It has witnessed a ruination of its identity. Regardless of culture or religion, one cannot erase from memory the images of hundreds of babies and children who were gunned down at point-blank range — taking with them to their graves any possible hope of an independent Palestine. Born out of conflict and tragedy, Gaza has witnessed the bloody pillage of its past, present, and future.

If the new year’s events thus far are any indication, 2009 is going to be a great year — or, if not a great year, at least an eventful one. The start of a new semester obviously begets new courses, new schedules, new syllabi, and new sources of stress eating away at free time. With this in mind, I have taken the liberty to sum up recent and future events with absolutely no personal bias or subjective interpretations. You’re welcome.
Obviously, everybody had a busy Tuesday and Wednesday last week. In a fittingly Lost-esque fashion, time stopped on Tuesday at noon for the inauguration of President Barack Obama. Has time ever stopped like this before? Have the masses of people ever simultaneously halted their mundane tasks on a regular Tuesday mid-January to stare in awe at moving images spawned by cathode ray tubes? Certainly not four years ago, for the last inauguration.
If President Obama could stop time, then Lost could manipulate time; it was indeed the long-awaited season premiere the very day after the inauguration. The episode really made fans wonder how they had survived all last semester on the mediocrity that abounded on television. The mind-bending, time-twisting plotlines reminded me, if not other fans, of a promise made by a member of the Obama administration: Hillary Clinton promised voters on David Letterman in the fall of 2007 that she was going to find out “what the heck is happening on Lost.” Mrs. Clinton, please get right on that.
In sports, my roommate explained to me that Super Bowl XLIII was “going to be big.” I checked out the official website just to be sure. And there it was: a video showing clips of Super Bowl history in all its black-and-white splendor surrounded by pictures of heroic-looking black-and-yellow clad figures with their primitive expressions of ferociousness and little red birds in all their cute chirpiness. There was even a countdown, complete with a decreasing column for seconds, just like the countdown timers people had for the Olympics or Bush’s last day in office.
In the spirit of the declining economy, I shelled out a grand total of $3.75 to catch an early-bird matinee showing of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, which has already captured a few Oscar nods. I figured that if the majority of us aged backward, we would end our lives in the luxurious masquerade of the roaring ’20s, indulging in liquor and feathers and frills, and maybe a 70-something Brad Pitt.
But then again, we wouldn’t have been old enough to appreciate a historic presidency, the (presumed) beating the Cardinals will receive from our Steelers, and, of utmost importance, what happens after they get off that island. Yes, 2009 is the year to be in.

In response to Forum Editorial (Sept. 15, 2008) “Will strategic plan be realized in the arts?”  I would like to put in perspective why Carnegie Mellon should supports the arts at the highest level.  
In the late 19th century in the U.K. many new schools of the arts were founded. Intimately linked to rapidly changing industrial circumstances, they responded to the need for new modes of design, marketing, and branding, to the needs of a changing society for re-shaping community life and culture. This model of higher education was reflected in the founding of the Carnegie Institute of Technology, with the Colleges of Fine Arts and of Engineering in dialogue with each other down the length of the Cut. 
Just over a century later Carnegie Mellon published a new strategic plan; and a few days later, the College of Fine Arts published its strategic plan also. In the Carnegie Mellon plan the words ‘creativity’, ‘creative inquiry’, ‘artistic inquiry’ and ‘thinking through doing’ are found at key points. These phrases emerged from the CFA planning process, which is an indication that the thinking found in CFA is still vitally in dialogue with the many other disciplines found in this university.  
There are many reasons why it is important that Carnegie Mellon supports the arts. First is that the arts disciplines help make Carnegie Mellon unique. The five schools in CFA (Architecture, Art, Design, Drama, Music) all have programs ranked in the top 10 in the country or, where rankings are not available, have other clear indicators of national and international levels of excellence. None of the other top 25 universities have all five of the disciplines at the depth that we have them here. This gives us an important leadership and advocacy role for the arts.   
Second, the arts enrich our lives and our experience of what it is to be human. It is through the arts that we express our cultural identity, and at a time when cultural identity is contested, rigorous education of the makers of cultural objects is crucial. Third, CFA is an integral part of many students’ lives. Over 400 non-music majors take music classes. Over 50 percent of art students have a structured interdisciplinary activity outside of art. People want to be part of the arts at the level they are carried out in CFA. 
A fourth reason for the importance of the arts is economic. Americans for the Arts states that arts-centric businesses account for 4.4 percent of all U.S. businesses. In 2004-5 arts-centric businesses had a growth rate of 5.5 percent compared to 3.8 percent for all U.S. businesses, and employment fell 1.9 percent, but just 0.8 percent in the arts. In the U.K. (which has a government minister for the creative industries) the creative industries constitute a larger part of the economy and employ more people than the financial services sector.  
Finally, I would ask you to look around any room. Everything that you can see could have been touched at some point in its production by a graduate of a college like CFA. This is a compelling reason for teaching all the arts at the highest level. The furniture, the clothes, the websites we use have been designed. The music we listen to, the films we see — composing, acting, editing, done by artists. All cultures need to tell stories that make sense of our lives. Big cultural statements and ubiquitous items all need quality design and aesthetic solutions. The iPod became the mp3 player of choice not because of superior technology, but because of superior design.
CFA has a vital and unique role to play in securing the future of all of its disciplines. Its aim, always, is for the future of the disciplines: preparing students for long careers as practitioners, and a belief that this education deserves the most rigorous of academic environments.

With the declining economy, the news is full of big-name companies that are in the midst of major layoffs. Hyundai Motor America, however, has come up with a new plan to combat dropping sales: They will allow customers to return their cars and be exempted from any remaining money they might owe.
Hyundai’s new program allows customers who lose their job within a year of purchasing a vehicle to return it, and Hyundai will pay the difference between the car’s trade-in value at the time of return and any remaining value of the loan, up to $7500.
With the creation of this new program, Hyundai hopes that customers will feel more confident about making expensive purchases like cars in the current uncertain economy. Although automobile sales have been dropping as of late, the new program could allow Hyundai’s sales to remain constant and also allow customers to feel like they have a safety net, a way out should they unexpectedly lose their jobs or run into other financial obstacles.
In addition to benefiting potential customers, the program could benefit  Hyundai as well. While it is certainly possible that not many people will take advantage of the new program (how many unemployed people will want to return their source of transportation and way of getting around to look for a new job?), the program does have the potential to bring new customers to Hyundai by showing people that Hyundai is looking out for its consumers’ wants and needs. It is very likely that customers will remember this sentiment once the economy begins to improve, something that may benefit Hyundai even more in the long run.
Hyundai, however, is certainly taking a big risk with the implementation of this program. Yes, their sales could skyrocket if many people purchase their cars and don’t lose their jobs. There is also the possibility, however, that people who buy the cars will choose to return them, and Hyundai could be left with many more cars than they know what to do with. So, while Hyundai is definitely taking a risk with their new program, it will hopefully turn out to benefit both Hyundai and consumers in these tough times.
The program is Hyundai’s way of showing that they do care about their customers and are aware of the financial constraints many people are facing these days. And that’s definitely something that people need to hear in times like these — that companies are thinking outside the box and trying to come up with solutions that benefit everyone.

Last week, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and his opposition, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, came face-to-face in talks aimed to move the country forward with a new, united leadership front. After 12 hours of discussion, however, no progress was made. The country remains politically stagnant, and its international reputation continues to falter. 
Zimbabwe has been characterized by  violent and backwards political turmoil since last summer, when the incumbent president Mugabe was re-elected from a one-candidate run-off after members of his political party, Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF), threatened and harmed some of Tsvangirai’s supporters. Largely as a result of the political chaos that has ensued, the sub-Saharan country has entered into agricultural, economic, and health-related crises, seemingly with no end in sight.
It is true that Zimbabwe is far away, in a different time zone, a different climate, and populated by speakers of multiple foreign dialects. But the country’s citizens, like those of the United States, are experiencing economic woes that are hindering the routine of their daily lives, as the economic recession/depression of the U.S. is changing the lives of citizens here. While the two economic crises must not be misunderstood as equal — they were caused at least in part by different factors and are being experienced in completely different cultures —  it is important to recognize parallels between two seemingly disparate cultures.
While widespread distaste for now-former President Bush’s actions and decisions is rampant (hey, we’re not disagreeing), U.S. citizens are lucky to avoid such a tyrannical ruler as Mugabe. His relentless desire to maintain power has led to collapsing health and education systems, a cholera epidemic, and inflation rising at such a rate that zeros were almost thoughtlessly removed from their currency to make monetary processing possible.
Mugabe is a danger to the people of Zimbabwe, and his illegitimate government is a danger to the reputation of national leaders on an international scale. His rule should cease, and the opposition power of Tsvangirai and his party should be allowed to rule such that the country may begin to recover from its own economic and political crises.

Imagine walking around Carnegie Mellon’s campus and seeing students who all look the same. Though this may seem a bit extreme, it is an example of what universities could be like without affirmative action.
Carnegie Mellon research suggests that if affirmative action were to be banned at top-tier universities, minority enrollment in those schools could decrease by 35 percent.
This research  comes after a number of major court decisions that call the constitutionality of affirmative action into question, and question its further use at universities. 
We believe that diversity is one of Carnegie Mellon’s strengths, and are against implementing a ban that might cost us this diversity. Affirmative action helps to ensure that applications from minority students are reviewed separately from their non-minority counterparts. Because there are fewer minority applicants, their applications might be overlooked without affirmative action and the diversity of our  student body would suffer. We cannot imagine that Carnegie Mellon would be the same top-tier university that it is today without the diversity that is so vital to its success.
This study provides a new way of looking at affirmative action and its effects on higher educational institutions. Rather than merely contributing to the same debate that has been going on since the program first began decades ago, the study provides possible answers about the issue: If we eliminate affirmative action, minority enrollment will fall and universities will be less diverse.
While the researchers may not have intended for the study to support a certain side of the debate, the results indicate that getting rid of affirmative action would be detrimental to the diversity of top-tier universities in general and Carnegie Mellon in particular.
Diversity is what makes Carnegie Mellon such a unique university, and increased minority enrollment benefits our campus and our community. Diversity is such a priority here that each year President Cohen delivers his annual diversity address just to talk about diversity and minorities at Carnegie Mellon. Carnegie Mellon’s minority population is currently about 14 percent, and the university has benefited greatly in terms of its interdisciplinary approach to learning from this relatively high percentage of minorities.
Having students from a variety of backgrounds improves students’ experiences and provides unique perspectives. Any decrease in minority enrollment would damage the balance of perspectives on campus and would have a negative effect on the college experience.

Hey Tartans,
I’d like to use this space today to introduce myself as the new Publisher of The Tartan and talk a little bit about some things I’ll be working on to serve you better this year. 
I come to this new position from my past year as the Photo Editor and hope to still be able to contribute an image every once in a while to our photo department. I am a junior in the Civil and Environmental Engineering program, lead worship at the CrossSeekers Christian fellowship, and sing bass with Joyful Noise.
This is an interesting time to be in the newspaper business. Papers across the nation are being shut down because of diving advertising revenues. Just last week, Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim gave a $250 million loan to The New York Times to help refinance their $1.1 billion debt and free some of their borrowing capacity.
Papers today must distinguish themselves not only in the content that they deliver but also in the way they deliver it. With high bandwidth connections and an increasing numer of mobile devices that eat multimedia for breakfast, news consumers have developed a voracious appetite for more than just the written word.
So as The Tartan moves forward into 2009, I am pursuing avenues to bring you some new ways to experience our paper. One way to enrich your experience online will be the addition of audio content to go along with the stories and photos that we publish. We will be providing training and the means for our staff to capture audio and publish it on the net.
Coming from a small island town in southeast Alaska, I have had the benefit of experiencing a great public radio station — KCAW — where it is a common practice to bring to listeners audio postcards from events in the surrounding area. I look forward to being able to bring you a clearer picture of events here on campus and in Pittsburgh through the use of these audio clips.
Be assured that I am not condemning the physical printed form of our newspaper. While I do love my Kindle for reading books while traveling, I’ve missed the way I used to be able to pass a good book along to a friend when I finished. However, it would be a shame if The Tartan did not take advantage of recent technological changes.
Thanks for picking up this copy of The Tartan and please check out www.thetartan.org for exciting new developments into this semester. Let me know what else you’d like to see from the paper at publisher@thetartan.org.
