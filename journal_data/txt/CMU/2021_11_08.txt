Week 10 was a down week in college football with no Top 10 matchups, but nobody told the teams playing. 
As a recap, #10 Auburn only managed a field goal while being blown out against Texas A&M #9 Wake Forest lost a 58-55 thriller to UNC; #4 Michigan State fell to Purdue on the road by 11 in a game that ended 40-29 in favor of the Boilermakers, taking out the Big Ten’s last undefeated team. #5 Cincinnati barely held off Tulane, while #3 Ohio State had a scare against Nebraska, winning with a nine-point margin. #1 Georgia, #2 Alabama, #7 Oregon, and #8 Michigan all won handily, and #6 Oklahoma had a bye week. With that, here are our rankings for this week:
Georgia maintained their #1 spot by crushing Missouri 43-6. An undefeated regular season is a distinct possibility for the Bulldogs, who haven’t really struggled yet this season — their closest win came against a Clemson squad that they held to a field goal. 
Alabama, at #2, narrowly survived a scare against LSU thanks in large part to a fourth-quarter goal-line fumble by the Tigers. Their performance has been underwhelming recently, but with three games to go in the regular season, Nick Saban’s squad looks poised to qualify for the SEC Championship against Georgia, should they be able to win out.
At #3 comes Ohio State, who survived Nebraska in a 26-17 slugfest on the road. The Buckeyes have played well enough this season that they should be in a position to make the playoffs, but they aren’t in the clear yet. Scheduled to face a Purdue team that has already ruined two playoff-bound seasons (those of Iowa and Michigan State) next week, the Spartans in Week 12, and the derby against Michigan in Week 13, Ohio State will have to play their hearts out to end the season with only one loss.
Below these three, with Michigan State’s loss, two undefeated teams living life on the edge — Cincinnati and Oklahoma — take the #4 and #5 slots, respectively. #6 Oregon, still held back by their bad loss to Stanford, sits at 8-1. Michigan State, after losing to Purdue by 11, sits at #7; and Michigan, who lost to the Spartans last week, is at #8. Notre Dame returns to the Top 10 at #9 and, after beating Alabama and Auburn in incredible upsets, Texas A&M slides into the #10 spot.
Next Week
Week 11, despite no Top 10 matchups, poses some risk to half of the Top 10. While teams like Alabama, Cincinnati, and Oregon should be fine against their lackluster opponents, Georgia, Ohio State, Michigan, and Texas A&M all face difficult matchups.
It's expected that #1 Georgia should beat the Tennessee Volunteers on the road, but there’s no guarantee against the feisty team that almost took out the Crimson Tide two weeks ago. A win for Georgia would cement their #1 spot, but if Tennessee can win, they have the chance to put themselves into the Top 10 and drop Georgia to #2 or #3.
It also seems that #3 Ohio State should be okay next week, but Purdue has been underrated all season, and, despite their 6-3 record, has taken out two teams widely seen to be playoff contenders. If the Boilermakers can knock Ohio State off as well, they should be a ranked team. The Buckeyes, meanwhile, could solidify their top-three spot by beating Purdue, but a loss could punish them. While they’ve been given some leeway with the playoff committee for their loss to Oregon, there’s no guarantee that they’ll be so kind the second time.
Perhaps the marquee matchup of the week will be #8 Michigan at Penn State. While the Nittany Lions (6-3) went on a three-game conference skid recently, they’re still in the running for a New Year’s Six and could pick one up by beating the Buckeyes, beating the Spartans on the season’s last day, and ending the year 9-3. Michigan, meanwhile, is still very much in the playoff hunt, but a loss in Happy Valley could end their season. This one should be close, and could be a great game.
Finally, #10 Texas A&M, who have pulled off two SEC upsets already, play Ole Miss in Oxford next week. Neither of these teams is very deep into the playoff hunt, but it should be a physical, exciting game. The winner will almost beyond doubt be in the Top 10, while the loser should drop five to 10 spots.
With just three weeks left in the regular season, the time has come to talk seriously about the playoff. Only four teams can make it. Right now, #1 Georgia seems to be nearly a lock to make it — a 12-0 regular season, even followed by a loss to Alabama, should be enough to keep them in. #2 Alabama and #3 Ohio State, on the other hand, are probably each a loss away from falling out of the playoff. The two have played comparably, with their sole losses coming to #10 Texas A&M and #6 Oregon, respectively, and impressive (but not dominant) wins aside from that. #4 Cincinnati and #5 Oklahoma are in the same boat too, as both are undefeated, but neither has performed at a level you’d expect out of an undefeated team — they’ve had close calls and every week seem to get closer to a loss. Further down, #6 Oregon and #7 Michigan State both have a bad loss to Stanford and Purdue, respectively, but they look like they could still make it. #8 Michigan, with wins in State College and Columbus, could squeak in, and everybody behind the Spartans looks dead in the water. It should be an interesting next few weeks in college football, as these eight teams are whittled down to four.

Group A
Manchester City put up a convincing 4-1 performance against Club Brugge at the Etihad, effectively putting their Matchday 2 loss against PSG behind them and regaining their position at the top of Group A. Having only won against Leipzig on Matchday 2, knockout stage qualification looks unlikely for Club Brugge, but wins on Matchdays 5 and 6 could still see the Belgian side advance. Leipzig, despite finally earning a point after four Matchdays in a 2-2 draw against PSG, has no shot at the round of 16, but two wins could still see them through to the Europa League. PSG, dropping points against Leipzig, no longer has a sure shot at advancing to the knockout stage, but a win and a draw on Matchdays 5 and 6 would see them through.
Group B
With a decisive 2-0 victory against Atlético Madrid, Liverpool has guaranteed themselves a spot in the round of 16. For Atlético, however, this is a hard loss to swallow. Sitting third in Group B, Atletico will need to win against AC Milan on Matchday 5, bet on Porto losing against Liverpool, then either win or draw against Porto on Matchday 6. In holding Porto to a 1-1 draw, AC Milan put themselves in a similar position to Leipzig in Group A, in that their Champions League campaign is pretty much over, but a shot at the Europa League is still possible. Porto will be trying to hang onto their second-place position in the table through Matchdays 5 and 6. To do so, they will need to beat Atlético Madrid on the final group stage Matchday.
Group C
Ajax beat a 10-man Dortmund on Matchday 4 and, in doing so, secured their place in the knockout stage. Dortmund, now tied points-wise with third-placed Sporting, will need to beat Sporting on Matchday 5 to maintain their qualifying position. Likewise, Sporting, having beat a 10-man Beşiktaş 4-0, will be desperate to beat Dortmund and elevate themselves into a qualifying position for the round of 16. Beşiktaş, sitting at the bottom of the table, having earned no points, is pretty much out of both the Champions League and the Europa League.
Group D
Real Madrid beat Shakhtar Donetsk 2-1 on Matchday 4, effectively putting their Matchday 2 loss against Sheriff Tiraspol behind them. With three points separating the top three teams in Group D, no one has a guaranteed shot at the round of 16, but Real will be looking to change that on Matchday 5. Sheriff, outmatched 3-1 by Inter Milan at home, will need to channel the energy they had on the first two Matchdays if they want to proceed to the knockout stage. Inter Milan, on the other hand, having won their last two Champions League games, have a good chance of making it through to the knockouts if they can keep that momentum up.
Group E
Bayern Munich put up a huge 5-2 win against Benfica on Matchday 4, guaranteeing themselves a place in the round of 16. Having lost for the second Matchday in a row, Benfica finds themselves in third, two points behind Barcelona. The Portuguese side will be traveling to Camp Nou on Matchday 5 and will do their best to flip the rankings. Barcelona’s victory against Dynamo Kyiv, although it comes as no surprise, does put Barça within reach of the knockout stage, and one more win at home on Matchday 5 will seal the deal. Dynamo Kyiv could still potentially scramble for a spot in the Europa League, but winning against both Bayern and Benfica is a tall task, and thus Kyiv’s Champions League and Europa League hopes are likely over.
Group F
Group F is still too close to call after Matchday 4. With Manchester United and Atalanta drawing 2-2 and Villareal beating Young Boys 2-0, just four points separate the top and bottom of the table, and two points separate first and third. The winners of Matchday 5 will likely see themselves through to the knockout stage, while a loss for any team could spell the end of their Champions League hopes.
Group G
Group G is in a similar situation to Group F. With Lille and Wolfsburg both seeing their first group stage victories, both in matches that ended 2-1 against Sevilla and Salzburg, respectively, the top and bottom of the table are separated by four points, and two points separate first and third. Thus, Matchday 5 and 6 will be decisive in determining who moves on to the round of 16, who is relegated to the Europa League, and who will be going home.
Group H
Group H is the only group where teams are likely set to remain in their current positions. Juventus, having beat Zenit St. Petersburg 4-2 on Matchday 4, sits comfortably at the top of the table, with Chelsea, who beat Malmö 1-0, just below. With 12 and 9 points respectively, both teams are pretty much guaranteed to move on to the knockout stage. Given Malmö’s performance across the last four Matchdays, it seems extremely unlikely for the Swedish side to win on both Matchday 5 and 6. This means that Zenit has a good chance of staying in third and being relegated to the Europa League, while Malmö will likely be going home in December.

Many remember the summer of 2016 as the summer that “Pokémon Go” was released to the public. Though it has been over five years since the app was initially launched, it has received more than one billion lifetime downloads, with more than 25 million in 2021. Since its release, the app has continually received updates that the app seemed to be missing at launch: a complete pokédex, a battling system, mega evolution, and more. Additionally, the game has made a revenue of over $5 billion across its lifetime, making $1.3 billion in 2020, its best year so far. As “Pokémon Go” has been a massive success, it’s no surprise that Nintendo and Niantic (two of the main companies involved in the development of “Pokémon Go”) teamed up once again to release an app based around another one of Nintendo’s popular franchises: “Pikmin Bloom.”
First arriving on Apple and Android app stores on Oct. 26, “Pikmin Bloom” is described as “an app that brings a little joy to your everyday journeys on foot.” The app is based on Nintendo’s “Pikmin” series. The central theme of this real-time strategy puzzle series is playing as explorers who arrive on the Earth-like planet PNF-404, where they encounter the strange creatures known as Pikmin. During their journey, the adventurers discover different colored Pikmin who aid the explorers.
“Pikmin Bloom” combines elements of the “Pikmin” series with a clear inspiration from “Pokémon Go.” In “Pikmin Bloom,” the player is represented by a “Mii,” a player avatar that is a trademark of many Nintendo consoles and games. The player has a squad of Pikmin that travels with them. As the player levels up, the size of their squad increases, which means more Pikmin can travel with you at the same time. To get more Pikmin, your squad can find more seedlings while you are walking or through “expeditions.” To grow these seedlings, you plant them and have to walk a certain number of steps (synced with the phone’s step data), similar to the egg hatching mechanic in “Pokémon Go.” 
While the core gameplay of “Pokémon Go” focuses on catching and raising Pokémon, the core gameplay of “Pikmin Bloom” is pretty straightforward: grow your squad and plant flowers. To plant flowers, players must collect flower petals from their Pikmin by feeding them nectar. Depending on the nectar given to your Pikmin, they will give different colored petals. Your Pikmin will sometimes give you fruit — which is immediately turned into nectar — after you have walked. You can also send your Pikmin on expeditions to collect fruit that is scattered across the map from places you have traveled to prior. As players progress in the game, they collect badges based on their accomplishments. For instance, players earn the “Apprentice Active Walker” badge for walking 3,000 steps and its upgrade for walking 100,000 steps.
Much like the app’s Pokémon counterpart, the player is placed on a map of the real world with landmarks serving a special purpose. In “Pikmin Bloom,” landmarks serve as big flowers, which bloom when players have planted enough flowers in the area surrounding the big flower. When the big flower blooms, its color will reflect the flowers that have been planted in its radius (which can be seen on the world map). When a big flower blooms, special items will be in its radius that players can send their Pikmin on expeditions to collect. Sometimes the big flowers will bloom into a special flower, such as a pansy or a rose.
On the world map, players can see the flowers that others have planted during their travels. Players can plant different colored flowers depending on which color petals they are currently using. 
“Pikmin Bloom” also has a friend feature, similar to the other games Niantic has released. Currently, friends can only send postcards to each other. When Pikmin are out on these expeditions, they will oftentimes collect postcards of the places they have been and give them to their owner. This allows friends to share their experiences of where they and their Pikmin have been traveling. You can also view your friends' level and badges that they have collected on their profile.
Also similar to “Pokémon Go,” “Pikmin Bloom” does contain microtransactions. Players can buy some upgrades, including flower petal storage, nectar storage, and Pikmin storage increases. Players can also purchase coins, the game’s currency. Coins can be spent in a variety of ways such as purchasing slots for growing Pikmin seedlings, flower petals, and nectar. While the game currently offers the player the chance to earn one coin for every 500 flowers they plant, depending on the player, it may take a long time to get enough coins to purchase anything in the shop without utilizing the game’s microtransactions. 
On top of its core gameplay, “Pikmin Bloom” also offers the user a chance to reflect on their day. Past 9:00 p.m., the app will show how many steps they had taken that day and then ask the user to rate their day using one of three faces: sad, neutral, or happy. The game will then select a photo that the user took that day from their camera roll (if they had taken one). The user can view how many steps they took, how they rated their day, and the associated picture in their lifelog, something that is not present in “Pokémon Go.”
Some additional features unique to “Pikmin Bloom” include friendship levels and Decor Pikmin. Players have friendship levels with each of their Pikmin and are measured in hearts. You can increase their friendship level by feeding them nectar and by sending them on expeditions. When a Pikmin reaches the maximum friendship level of four hearts, it will have a chance to become a Decor Pikmin upon returning from an expedition. As of this article’s writing, there are 155 different Decor Pikmin consisting of 21 different types. Players who connect their “Pikmin Bloom” account with their Nintendo account will receive a huge seedling that sprouts after 10,000 steps to give a Decor Pikmin with a Mario hat. 
While “Pokémon Go” has more of an actual game feel to it, “Pikmin Bloom” has been regarded as more of a walking app by many. As “Pikmin Bloom” is missing the more competitive aspects of its Pokémon counterpart, it has its own charm that appeals to a more casual community — its lifelog feature and more cooperative nature with other players are evidence of this. 
On Nov. 13, “Pikmin Bloom” will be hosting its first Community Day, similar to the Community Day of “Pokémon Go.” On this day, seedlings will grow at 1.5 times their usual speed, fruit will give twice as much nectar, big flowers will bloom into pansies, and users who walk more than 10,000 steps will be given a special “Community Day Participant” badge.

The power grid simulations that could help save lives sooner
Sometimes when the power goes out, it's just a little extra darkness in the room. Other times, it can lead to hundreds freezing to death, as it did in the Texas winter storm. Carnegie Mellon graduate student Aayushya Agarwal, Systems Scientist Amritanshu Pandey, and Department Head of Electrical and Computer Engineering Larry Pileggi worked on an algorithm that would improve power grid simulations that could prevent similar situations that result from natural disasters. Oftentimes, algorithms to locate disturbances like failed power lines or severe weather take a while to be calculated, costing time that could be used to respond to the power grid failure. The researchers' algorithm, however, is able to take prior information about the power grid to simulate what the power grid should look like in the present without the disturbance, which can help locate what is the source of the disturbance.
Looking into the future of software systems
Tech has always been seen as the future, but what is to come for the future of tech itself? Carnegie Mellon's Software Engineering Institute released a study envisioning areas of development and focus for the future of software systems. Core focuses include looking into facilitating the growth of software development with artificial intelligence and assurance practices and encouraging collaboration between academia and industry as well as software engineering and artificial intelligence. 
Anti-COVID-19 pills shown to reduce hospitalization and death rates
The U.K. approved of pharmaceutical company Merck's new antiviral pill molnupiravir, also known as Lagevrio, on Nov. 4, with the pill reducing the risk of hospitalization or death by about 50 percent for adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 cases. A day later, Pfizer announced its own antiviral pill called Paxlovid which reduces the chances of COVID-19 hospitalization or death by 89 percent. The FDA will make a decision of whether to approve Merck's pill for emergency use authorization at the end of November, and Pfizer says they will soon submit their application for emergency use authorization.
Microsoft unveils productivity app Microsoft Loop, competitor to Notion
Microsoft announced its new productivity application, Microsoft Loop, on Nov. 2. Described as a "powerful and flexible canvas with portable components," the product enables collaboration and database-integrated document editing in a manner very similar to apps like Notion, Coda, and AirTable. Its greatest difference is its integration with the rest of Microsoft Office and Teams, allowing Office users to embed documents inside Loop more easily than other apps and to send Loop documents in Teams. Its release date has yet to be announced.

It’d been a while since I’d been to an opera, and even though I got my tickets for “La Finta Giardiniera” well in advance, I guess I didn’t fully process that I was going to an opera — a real opera. I know this because when the first sung note of “La Finta Giardiniera” hit my ears, I immediately started writing my notes in all caps, my brain flung into utter chaos. It was beautiful. It was wonderful. I was reminded that opera singers sing with no microphones and it doesn’t even matter because they’re better without them. 
My experience only improved as the plot began to develop before me. “La Finta Giardiniera'' — or “The Fake Garden-Girl” — first premiered in 1775, written by Mozart when he was only 18. It puts the opera in soap opera, with a minimalist-type cast and a low demand on audience analysis. Five characters engage in a classic, plot-twist, love-triangle dance, all via Italian language vocals set over a whimsical and ever-changing melodic track.
We begin with Podestà, owner of the home where the story takes place. The story circles predominantly around an upcoming boxing match between Ramiro “The Dove” and Belfiore “The Count”; however, Belfiore has arrived at Podestà’s home for another reason: to marry his outspoken niece, Arminda. This is unfortunate because Ramiro is still nursing a heart broken by Arminda, who deemed him too poor to love. Meanwhile, Belfiore’s presence at the home has shaken up Podestà’s garden-girl — whom he is also in love with — because they had been married until he had attempted — unsuccessfully, unbeknownst to him — to kill her. In the background of all of this action, a worker in the house, Nardo, chases after his co-worker Serpetta, who has absolutely no interest in him.
The tumultuous, if predictable, action was set on a wonderfully minimal set, with simple emotions portrayed lightheartedly by the actors. The most fun part of watching this show was watching the actors have even more fun. As the program noted, the subtitles were not accurate to the literal Italian translations of the vocal parts, and in many cases lines were even added where they did not necessarily occur in the music. Rather than take away from the quality of the show however, the eccentric and ever-comedic subtitling played a large role in the overall modernization of the classic opera and consistently engaged the audience. Tropes and ideas that were native to Mozart’s teenage years were made brand new and relevant by the utter simplicity of the piece - even elements of domestic abuse were approached with care, though it was easy to see the traces of misogynistic values in what original writing remained exposed.
It was an enjoyable opera, with an incredibly charismatic cast, enjoyed by an audience that had a wholesome community aura. There was something for everyone — a failed wedding, a failed proposal, female empowerment, drugs and alcohol, and some unadulterated drama. After two of the characters decide to get high, a dark sequence followed which involved flashlights, glow-in-the-dark Styrofoam popcorn, and neon safety vests. It was pure chaos and pure joy — a wonderful intro to opera for any newcomers and a perfect piece for those who have sat through many.

Resembling Russia is open to the public from November 3rd-9th at the Ellis Gallery, on the third floor of the College of Fine Arts. Her work can also be found at www.esterpetukhova.com and @esterpetu on instagram.
Ester Petukhova's solo art exhibition, "Resembling Russia,'' is a brilliant and revelatory show, understated in its presentation yet stretched taut with ideas. In 10 or so short pieces, Petukhova crafts a slate of juxtapositions. The most obvious of these is the juxtaposition of Petukhova's Russian and American identities, but this becomes one of many when the time is taken to reflect on all the other tensions present in her work. There is a tension between sincerity and irony, a tension between the past and the present, a tension between childhood and adulthood, and lastly, a tension between sentimentality and cool detachment. While Ester is an astute mimetic, with brightly-saturated figurative works and a knack for portraiture, I am impressed by her ability to push her figurative works into broader contexts — hers could easily fit alongside work in the tradition of pop art or fit alongside artists working in text and meme-related images. However, the seriousness and rigor present across her pieces makes her distinct from her contemporaries.
Petukhova and her family left her birthplace of Vologda, Russia, when she was only one. This is an experience that any individual would find difficult to capture, so I am fascinated by how she continually reckons with this past without cliché or self-pity. The work that epitomizes Petukhova's ability to manipulate nostalgia is the standout painting "Vologda," a small square of fast-moving green. Painted with tense, small brushstrokes of great movement that differ from the flat, tight application of paint in her other works, it is a small square of pure past. A blur, a movement, and a gesture. Looking at it made me ache. I felt like a child looking out the window of a car while the world moves by at full tilt, far too rapidly.
Other standout works are her three portraits: "Portrait of Daniel Blokh: To Russia, Concerning Love," "Grocery shopping with my virtual roommates," and "Disappearing cabinets and students in the church cafeteria." These three portraits are a perfect microcosm of Pethukova’s artistic progression. Her talent for portraiture has always been obvious, but it is clear from these three works that her conceptual rigor continues to develop with momentum.
"Portrait of Daniel Blokh: To Russia, Concerning Love," painted while Petukhova was still in high school, displays her intense control of line and shape, bristling with small concentrated planes of color. Look at his hands; look at his eyes; look at the pattern in the couch. 
"Disappearing cabinets and students in the church cafeteria," by contrast, appears at first glance to be simpler. White space abounds. The subject is defined, yet the world around her seems to be slowly popping away to emptiness. Look at the layering of the colors of the stacked glasses. Look again, at the hands. Look at the sly beginnings of a smile on the subject’s face. 
The manipulation of nostalgia is at work again. I longed to see the details of the image that were left out. Was the subject with her friends? What, or whom, was she laughing at? We are left with bits, pieces, saturated colors, and an intense feeling of love and longing. 
The conceptual richness of Petukhova's approach to portraiture is most concentrated in her piece "Grocery shopping with my virtual roommates." This work combines the filled-to-the-brim relationship of colors, shapes, and textures found in her Blokh portrait with the conflict of time and memory found in “Disappearing cabinets.” At first, the painting seems to be a cohesive image, yet again, I ask you to look closer. Each element of the painting is taken from different places and different times. Petukhova is a talented enough artist that if she wanted to make it appear like each subject was in the same place, she could have. The jarring, nearly imperceptible awkwardness of how each piece slots together was a choice. It is the collapse of space. In this work, and across all her works, Petukhova crafts a past that never occured from the pieces of the past she has.
Two more things I'd like to touch on before I close out my review — Petukhova's usage of irony and her depictions of food. "Irony" is perhaps too strong a word, but Petukhova certainly seems to be rolling her eyes at something. In describing the aforementioned piece, "Vologda," I declined to mention one of the most important details — in the upper left-hand corner is a logo, painted, almost resembling a sticker, of a piece of hay with Russian text superimposed. I could translate it here, but even without translation, this artistic choice worked wonderfully to curb the sentimentality of the greenery behind it. 
Petukhova appropriates fonts and marketable images, in a way bridging the divide between the consumerist West and the nostalgic East. Using advertising slogans or referencing pop cultural icons like the Olsen twins may not be a radical choice in itself. However, when combined with the skill of her line and the seriousness of the underlying subject matter, these choices function at higher levels, pose a multitude of questions, and become less easy to define or even describe. 
Petukhova's depictions of food also defy my descriptive abilities. I encourage you, again, to see them for yourself. What I find most fascinating about these culinary commentaries is how they push the techniques she developed in her portraiture to greater extremes. There's a conflict between the beauty of the colors, the elegance with which they are arranged, and the fact that the foods themselves may be slightly repulsive. Canned fish on bread, caviar on Lay's potato chips, an elaborate swirl of mayonnaise on a grimacing fish, all rendered in colors so bright you succumb to their charms.
It is very exciting to me that such a small concentration of works can contain such an intense level of conflict, juxtaposition, and technical ability. I am excited to see what she produces next and encourage all those reading my review to discover her work for themselves.

This October, DC Comics made a huge announcement: In the newest arc, Supeman would come out as bisexual. In "Son of Kal-El," Clark Kent's son, Jon Kent, has assumed the role of Superman, since Clark Kent had to leave Earth to fight aliens (comic books shenanigans). In a forthcoming issue, Jon Kent has a romance with another man, making "Son of Kal-El" the coming out of Earth's greatest hero as bisexual.
The announcement was a point of celebration for many, and it added another bisexual character to the DC Universe after Tim Drake's Robin also came out as bisexual the month before. They joined a growing cast of LGBTQ+ characters in DC Comics like Batwoman, Harley Quinn, and Aqualad, who have come out in the years before.
However, Superman is much more popular than all those other characters, and backlash was swift. Multiple conservative politicians and commentators decried DC's decision in offensive ways I will not repeat here. Even Dean Cain, who played Superman on TV in the 90's, said of DC Comics that "they're bandwagoning." The backlash escalated further, and news broke days ago that some of the workers producing the new Superman comics received police protection after threats.
As for myself, I did not see Superman's coming out coming even though I was following "Son of Kal-el," but I welcome it. It seems overdue that comics — and hopefully movies, very soon — actually reflect the people reading them. However, it is disappointing to see such a huge backlash, and it's even more disappointing to see it escalate so quickly. 
To call the people making threats or homophobic remarks about Superman "disgruntled fans," though, would be dishonest, and, frankly, incorrect. I'm sure Senator Josh Mandel doesn't ever go to comic shops, but that's not the reason I would exclude him from being a fan. The conservative commentators and people making threats don't deserve to be called fans because Superman, as a character, has his origins standing against racism, xenophobia, and discrimination.
Superman was originally the creation of Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel, who were both sons of Jewish immigrants. However, Superman wasn't just created by Jewish immigrants. He has also been recognized as being Jewish-coded. Superman's kryptonian name, Kal-El, seems to borrow from Hebrew: in Hebrew "El" refers to god, and "Kal" means "voice". Additionally, Superman is an alien who was sent to Earth by his parents so he could live as Krypton was dying. Many have pointed out that Kal-El's journey mirrors the story of Moses.
Shuster and Siegel's beliefs also shined through their writings. In one 1940 comic, Superman arrests Hitler and takes him before the League of Nations to answer for his crimes. In this comic, Superman even threatens Hitler with a "strictly non-Aryan sock on your jaw." 
Superman's first stories established a tradition of him standing for the vulnerable. A 1940s Superman radio series "Clan of the Fiery Cross" had Superman crush the KKK, and the series was credited with decreasing the KKK's membership. In 2020, perhaps sensing the times, DC comics remade it into a new graphic novel titled "Superman Smashed the Klan," where Superman defends a Chinese-American family from the KKK.
Superman isn't compatible with the racial dogma or homophobia that the critics speaking against his coming out preach. He's the child of immigrants, has his roots in fighting xenophobia and racism, and is a symbol of hope. Unfortunately for conservatives, he's no Punisher. He's not so easily co-opted as a symbol of violence and hate because that is not what his character has ever stood for.
Still, Superman has not been the symbol of hope for all that he should be. Comic book characters in general have not been representative of people in the LGBTQ+ community. For an example, just look at the 1950s Batman. At first, Batman didn't have a love interest. Then psychiatrist Fredric Wertham published a book (based on falsified research) that started an anti-gay panic started in the 1950s. In his book, Wertham infamously described Batman and Robin as a "wish dream of homosexuals living together." The company that would become DC Comics decided that they needed to make clear Batman was straight. This spawned the original version of Batwoman, who was then a love interest for Batman. The writing mandates that made these superheroes explicitly straight kept superheroes from representing many of their readers.
However, this just makes it even more crucial that there is representation in comics now. After years of comic books without characters of different races and sexualities, the status quo is finally starting to budge. As Superman comics become more representative of their readers, they will become what Clark Kent's Superman wants in "Son of Kal-El": "A place where no one is left behind."

When I was younger, there was one coffee table book that I always returned to. It ensorcelled and inspired me. Even now, I can still remember individual pages from this book: “Going, Going, Gone: Vanishing Americana” by Susan Jonas and Marilyn Nissenson. Originally written in 1994, with a second edition in 1998, the book purports to “celebrate and eulogize the quintessential aspects of twentieth-century life — good and bad — that are disappearing forever.” 71 aspects of American Life that were, at the time, going, going, or gone are included, with extensive write-ups on each. The introduction to the second edition explains its raison d’être as so: 
“As the end of the twentieth century nears and a new millennium beckons, most of us are impelled to look backward and forward simultaneously. [...] Pundits and publicists are constructing lists of best things, worst things, most important inventions, most meaningful social developments, most beautiful, most outrageous. They are prophesying how Americans will live in the decades to come. [...] At the risk of being overlooked in all this tumult are the quotidian, the mundane, the homey, and the homely. [...] We have tried to stop time for a moment to acknowledge transitions, both major and minor [in American life.]” 
The authors mention that, of course, many things will be going without ever being fully gone. Cavities are one such example. While people still get cavities, and the amount they get may increase in the future as we eat more unhealthy foods, the advent of fluoride in our toothpaste and water has drastically reduced the amount.
A flip through the book will show a diverse range of contents, from former cultural mainstays like playing marbles, to terrible diseases like Polio. The objects and ideas that vanished from America in the late 20th Century are not all good, but they definitely all held meaning to somebody. Even now, some who think back to a better past think about hitchhiking, paperboys, or milkmen; aspects of their lives that have left them.
As stated before, not all of these supposed discarded elements of history have remained away. Something like the drive-in movie experienced a brief resurgence during the COVID-19 epidemic as a socially conscious way to watch movies with strangers. iPhones have brought back the unanswered phone, which briefly disappeared with the advent of answering machines that had gotten rid of all the mysteries of who could call when you were away. Now, of course, everyone’s voicemail boxes are filled with garbage, and who even answers calls anymore? Or what about vinyl records? Definitely on the out in the 90s, now definitely on the in.
All these forgotten aspects represent the idea of an America caught in a snapshot. We no longer have American elms, black smoke departing our Pittsburgh smokestacks, or men wearing garters to keep their socks up. Many formerly ubiquitous elements of this suburban middle class life have disappeared, perhaps gone forever. A flip through this book lets us go back to a time now gone and gives us snapshots of it the way a child would experience it. There is not exactly a “whitewashing” of history, but by the very nature of this book, most objects and ideas mentioned will have been positive, or if not positive, at least positively quirky. Like shoe-fitting fluoroscopes? Really?
Of course, by now, even this book is a nostalgic statement. The article on the slide rule shows the derision one child gave to his engineer father about how he’d “rather press buttons.” Now the same engineer would never dare use a so-called “nerd stick.”
“Going, Going, Gone: Vanishing Americana” certainly does really make a grand statement, and the authors certainly didn’t try to. Sometimes there is just room for a simple coffee table book to keep alive memories that will be leaving us otherwise. It has already been 20 years since the publishing of this book, and we have seen how short our public consciousness is, and how quickly former ubiquitous elements of life disappear. We cured Polio, but now some elements of our populace seem to have forgotten how. Or we have the automat, carbon paper, library card catalogs, fan magazines, fire escapes, fur coats, leisure suits, navy blue suits, required penmanship classes, stockings, and white gloves (among others). These are functionally no longer produced, used, or taken (unless strictly as a nostalgic reference to their existence). Let’s leave space for a book like this one. Otherwise where could we learn this:
“Sixty women in Tulsa, Oklahoma, were asked during World War II what they missed most; twenty women said men, forty said nylons. – Du Pont archives”

This article contains spoilers for Dune (2021)
While some movies feel like a love letter to their source material, Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune” feels like a wedding invitation. Villeneuve’s adaptation of the landmark 1965 book by Frank Herbert emanates the same intrigue and somber reverence of its novel counterpart, but it’s worth saying that they are both very, very long and detailed works. Therefore, rather than go over in excruciating detail each and every event in the movie and piece of backstory, I will attempt to cover the film in broad strokes, while focusing here and there on those moments that demand it.
That said, some introduction to the world is necessary. “Dune” takes place several thousand years in the future, with humanity now occupying countless planets in the galaxy. In order to allow travel between these worlds, humans need both faster-than-light technology, as well as the ability to chart courses to their destinations. The latter goal is accomplished by a substance called “melange,” or spice, a mind-expanding, life-extending drug that, when taken in heroic doses, can be used to read space and time like the cosmic pages of a relativistic book. Spice is the single most important resource in the universe for this reason alone. What’s more, the only place that this substance can be found is on the desert planet Arrakis, or Dune (small sidenote: if your ears prick up at the mention of a resource central to transportation being located somewhere that sounds a lot like Iraq, you have good instincts). Arrakis is currently occupied by two groups, the native Fremen and the offworld Harkonnen, who serve largely as the antagonists. The movie opens with the Emperor handing over the planet to House Atreides, of which the main character Paul (Timothée Chalamet) is a member. Paul is the son of the Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaacs) and his concubine Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), and is first in line for the duchy. There are essentially five forces at play throughout the book, either immediately, behind the scenes, or in plain view:
Bene Gesserit: A coven of witches who possess complete control over their bodies’ functions. They operate in the shadows, urging the crossbreeding of different Houses.
Guild Navigators: This group is in charge of transport and commerce in the Empire. They use the spice to navigate the stars.
The Empire: The overarching political body that is headed by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. His will is enforced by the fanatical and deadly Sarduakar, or “the Emperor’s blades”.
House Atreides: Long descendants of the ancient Greeks, their homeworld of Caladan is a lush ocean paradise. They value honor and loyalty above all else.
House Harkonnen: Vicious slavers that backstab and sabotage to achieve their aim. They inhabit the industrial planet Giedi Prime.
Of course, there are plenty of entities that are left out of this list, and writing this article, I begin to understand the difficulty that Villeneuve must have felt when making this film: there is too much to communicate sufficiently. Mentats, the Bene Tleilaxu, the Bulterian Jihad, the Orange Catholic Bible. All of these elements push the narrative as well, but their explanation would largely bloat what is already a hearty movie.
So then, with some understanding of the canvas, how well was it painted? One thing to notice immediately about the film is the variations of focus that are used by the camera, and how that contributes to the feeling of a scene. In dream sequences, there is often a very intimate close-up of a person’s body. Bloody hands. Narrowing eyes. Sandy feet. Much like real dreams, these visions consist not of a tapestry of cohesive images, but rather collections of icons and individual details. In the waking world, there is even more variation. People are often placed in positions that complement the geometry around them. When the Reverend Mother tests Paul in the library, she is placed such that her headdress and chair make her appear as a menacing chess piece. When the Sarduakar and Harkonnens attack the Atreides at Dune’s capital Arrakeen, the two forces are dwarfed by the size of the ships that are attacking. Wherever people are, their bodies feel very much connected to the space around them, subtly hinting that humanity’s fate is always intertwined with the places we inhabit.
“Dune” is very much a feast for the eyes, but the ears do not go without. Most sci-fi soundtracks are either bombastic John Williams marching band music or filled with electronic effects to produce an “otherworldly” feeling. Hans Zimmer’s genius shines through in that he is able to take very traditional, very human musical motifs, and bend and warp them through the millenia so that they sound very alien. When the Sarduakar throat singing kicked in, I felt chills run down my back. Here was this musical tradition that goes back thousands of years on Earth being used on a planet billions of miles away, in a language we’ll never know, for a religion that we’ll never hear explained. When the Atreides had bagpipes at their arrival on Arrakis, I felt a soaring feeling of pride, and I’m not even Scottish. I think what makes the score of “Dune” so powerful is that it does not try to separate the human beings watching from the human beings portrayed. Heroism, mystery, religious fanaticism, powerful ecstasy. These elements of humanity were preserved when we went to the stars, so why not convey them the same way we always have.
It is difficult to judge acting, especially when it is subtle. “Dune,” with all its lasguns, Holtzman fields, and swords, is very subtle. This is largely because in the book, for every line of spoken dialogue, there is a corresponding inner dialogue that the reader is privy to. In the 1984 Lynch film, you can hear the whispered thoughts of the actors on screen, but Villeneuve gives us no such luxury. Instead, those thoughts become vocalized in some fashion. The most powerful line in the film and book is easily the Litany Against Fear, a mental mantra used in times of panic to quell one’s emotions. In the book, Paul has to use it repeatedly, but the first time we see it is when he has to withstand the excruciating pain he finds himself in under the test of the Gom Jabbar with the Reverend Mother. However, rather brilliantly, we hear his mother Lady Jessica say it aloud just outside the door, trying to suppress her fear that her son is going to die. We see both actors’ faces rise in distress and horror, reach a fever pitch, and then the fear breaks. Only they remain. The dynamic between Paul and his mother is easily the best in film. It mirrors the book almost perfectly, as Paul has to take on a world of responsibility that his mother is very guilty of giving to him. In each act, Paul has to metamorphose more into the superbeing he is meant to be while his mother watches on in horror. I distinctly remember my own mother having the same reaction when I was a teenager, learning to lead holy wars and see the future.
Movie reviews are largely a tedious process, for how do you talk meaningfully about something that is meant to be read, watched, listened to, and felt in one’s heart? I think the answer is simply I cannot, and doubly so for “Dune.” With as many themes as growing up, ecological stewardship, the dangers of faith, and self-knowledge, any limp attempt made by a college-aged writer would flaccidly fall far too short of explaining it. Watch the movie, read the book, and sneer viciously at all those that tried to copy it (looking at you, George Lucas).

We encounter many strange and unusual natural phenomena here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Whether it’s the morning smog creeping over Flagstaff like the hand of fate, or random unprompted pebbles of ice pummeling from the sky, I think we can truly say we have seen it all. And this fall is no different — we will witness a yearly natural wonder: the slow but inevitable appearance of the Canada Goose across our beloved campus.
This rare and expensive being is known for its incredible insulatory properties — but beware! The wearers themselves are feral creatures, prone to snap their beaks at anyone who might question where “the money’s coming from.” The jacket? It is always a gift, and no, it’s not a status symbol; the wearer just happens to have one "'cause it keeps them warm." Unfortunately for us goose-watchers, this particular breed is wont to disappear unexpectedly over weekends, with its wearer often going on private trips both up and down the East Coast and overseas, so the species is primarily only observable on weekdays. To my fellow birdwatchers, make note!
Several other species which also bear mentioning are popping up across our festering ecosystem. Beware, birdwatcher, of the Carhartt — it is a two-faced animal. The wearer might own it simply due to its durability, but do not fall for that lovely young boy you assume is the son of a steelworker due to his workwear garb and steel-toed boots. You might find it is all, at its base, an aesthetic gesture, and the wearer is not truly working-class but rather a breed much closer to the aforementioned Canada Goose. However! This ornithologist is willing to concede that on many occasions, particularly in Pittsburgh at our particular trade school, the Carhartt is indeed being used towards its original workwear intention.
And what is this, flying down so lightly and softly to sip at the watering-hole? It is a North Face! A sturdy and colorful species, migrating south from Yosemite to hibernate in our little Tinseltown for the wintertime. The North Facer is easy to identify from far away, from the sound of their Redbubbled Hydro Flask hitting the floor with a resounding clang every four to five minutes. The soft padding of their Uggs are also a key to locating the breed. 
Lastly, but not least, by far the strangest animal I’ve observed on campus is a stark departure from these three species — it is in a category of its own. Even on the coldest, wettest, and most miserable of days, I’ve observed an abnormal number of young males wearing nothing but a hoodie, and a logo-ed one at that. Is the need to publicize one’s internship stronger than the need for warmth? Is the redundancy of stating the university we are all already attending on one’s hoodie so necessary, so vital, and so important, that a coat dare not conceal it? Further research is needed into the matter.

Q. My roommate keeps sexiling me over and over. What do I do?
A. First off, nice! That was for your roommate, not you. Get a life, ya virgin, or learn how to sleep in the tub.
Q. Hey, my roommate keeps sleeping in the tub whenever I’m trying to get busy. How do I get them to leave?
A. In a perfect world, I would tell you to ask them to join you. My freshman year, my roommate and I shared everything, and I mean everything. Needed a pencil? He was the man. Need an extra towel? Let’s just shower together dude! Your partner’s on the way? Cool, let me get us some Gatorade. My point is, if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go fa’, ménage à trois. 
Q. I’m trying to start Christmas shopping early, but I’m afraid that the supply line stuff will mess that up. How do I get around a global economic disaster?
A. There is no greater gift than the one that comes from the heart. Even before the world turned upside down, the best presents were those that people made from scratch. Did you know that raccoons observe Christmas too? Yes, they reach into the trash and create little gifts made from wrappers, old food, and what biologists call “a truly staggering amount of used contraceptives.” This year, learn from your fellow mammals and give a gift that you know they can’t throw away.
Q. I know it’s kind of late in the semester, but I want to join a club. Which ones should I look at?
A. The most prestigious organization on campus is one you’ve probably never even heard about. Called the Sons of Andrew, this secretive organization recruits only the most promising students. No, there’s no GPA requirement, referrals needed, or even an application. The best way to get their attention is to stand at the top of Hammerschlag during a thunderstorm, steel bar in one hand and a promissory note in the other. Then, you should be approached by a shadowy figure that will then dj9iaepoipoiopjpaaaaaaa

A year ago, voters took polling stations and mail-in ballots by force; the 2020 presidential election amassed the highest voter turnout since 1900. If 2021 election results are any indication of public opinion, voters are unimpressed with the Biden Administration. State and municipal governments across the country shifted right, leaving Democrats scrambling to reimagine campaign efforts.
After swinging blue for Biden in 2020, Pennsylvania restored equilibrium on Nov. 2 by electing Republican candidates down the ballot, including state Supreme Court Justice-elect Kevin Brobson and Superior Court Judge-elect Megan Sullivan. As with the majority of large cities, Pittsburgh maintained its Democratic leadership; it has not had a Republican mayor since 1936. Ed Gainey continued this precedent, defeating Tony Moreno, who ran as the Republican challenger following his loss in the Democratic primary. As a Pittsburgh native, Gainey grew up in South Oakland and East Liberty, and he has experienced the city’s complacency towards gentrification. His platform emphasized the importance of creating safe neighborhoods. Gainey secured his mayoral candidacy during the May primary, winning 46 percent of the vote — around 7 percent higher than incumbent Bill Peduto. Gainey went on to win the general election, making history as Pittsburgh’s first Black mayor. 
The gubernatorial race in Virginia was among the most anticipated of Tuesday’s elections, drawing in the highest voter turnout rate in the state since 1997. The contest was split between Democrat Terry McAuliffe (who held the position from 2014 to 2018) and Republican Glenn Youngkin (an affluent businessman and political neophyte). A day before the election, New York Times Op-Ed columnist Bret Stephens was willing to bet “a California cabernet that Youngkin wins.” A toast to Stephens: Youngkin received 50.7 percent of votes. Election analysis by the New York Times showed that, compared to results from the 2020 presidential election, every county in the state demonstrated higher Republican voting margins. Among Youngkin’s most mobilizing pillars was parental choice and authority in education. “As governor,” his campaign website states, “Glenn will empower parents and restore excellence and commonsense in education.” 
The political subtext of this statement is rooted in a fierce conservative aversion to critical race theory, an academic framework that examines the role of racism in creating and perpetuating de jure and de facto discrimination. In a televised roundtable discussion this October, McAuliffe described critical race theory as a “dog whistle,” after saying, “​​I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.” The framework is only taught on college campuses, but Republican pundits and politicians have recently seized on the opportunity to stoke parental fears that it will be incorporated into elementary and high school classrooms. It was a winning strategy.
Sweeping Republican victories in Virginia included historic breakthroughs in representation. In a 50.7 to 49.3 split, voters elected Winsome Sears as lieutenant governor. She will be the first woman and first woman of color to assume this role but has historically shifted away from discussions surrounding race. Her platform underscores tax cuts, promotes “our law enforcement heroes,” encourages pay raises for teachers, and proposes to politically and economically empower Black Virginians. Before her election campaign, Winsome Sears served as the National Chair for Black Americans Making America First. In the race for attorney general, Jason Miyares defeated Democratic incumbent Mark Herring by two percentage points. Miyares will be the first Latino person to assume this office. His campaign emphasized constituents’ security by supporting police and “restor[ing] law and order.” 
New Jersey’s gubernatorial race did little to quell left-leaning unease surrounding the Nov. 2 elections. Though Democratic incumbent Phil Murphy maintained his position with 50.9 percent of the vote, this was far less than his 2017 win of 56 percent. Yet the state’s biggest attention-grabber spotlighted the race for State Senate President. It is one of the most powerful positions in the state — and a Republican truck driver just beat its two-term Democratic incumbent. 
Regardless of general election results, Boston was on track to elect its first woman and first person of color as mayor. Michelle Wu secured the position over her opponent and former colleague Annisa Essaibi George 64 to 36. Both women were Democratic city councilors prior to their campaigns. Wu took notably progressive stances, especially on climate justice — she has proposed her own Green New Deal for Boston — and affordable housing. 
Voters in Buffalo were less enthused about their opportunity for progressive leadership. In June, healthcare worker and community organizer India Walton won the Democratic mayoral primary against incumbent Byron Brown. Undeterred, Brown led a write-in campaign in the general election, promoting centrism over Walton’s Democratic Socialist pedagogy. To advance his reelection attempts, Brown’s campaign distributed $100,000 worth of rubber stamps. He claimed victory on Tuesday.
New York City will be led by the more moderate Eric Leroy Adams, the city’s second Black mayor in history. Adams, who formerly served as a police captain, is preceded by Bill de Blasio, who reached his term limit this year. 
In addition to elected leadership, voters across the country decided on changes to state legislation. New York ballots included two measures to expand voting accessibility. The first would have removed the requirement of 10-day-advance registration (to potentially be replaced with same-day voting); the second would have let the State Legislature implement no-excuse absentee voting. Neither proposition passed. Voters also had the opportunity to advance a redistricting amendment that would require that all residents — regardless of citizenship — be counted (“should the federal census fail to do so”) and that “incarcerated persons be counted at the place of their last residence for redistricting.” This initiative also failed.
Ballots in Austin included a proposal to bolster the city’s police department following a successful 2020 defunding campaign that slashed its budget by one-third. “Voters threw [the ballot measure] in the trash,” freelance journalist Christopher Hooks wrote in the "TexasMonthly"; the proposition failed 31 to 69. This was a small victory for progressive denizens amidst recent abortion restrictions and proposed gerrymandered districts in Texas. Minneapolis also posed a ballot question related to policing: Should the city’s police force be replaced with a public safety department focused on de-escalation measures and mental health support? 56 percent of voters said no. 
Across candidate elections and ballot initiatives, a wave of red swept through the country’s political currents. Domenico Montanaro, a senior political editor for NPR, described the Nov. 2 elections as a “bad omen for Democrats.” Will they pick up the slack for 2022?

The Student Senate held a meeting with a company examining Carnegie Mellon University Police Department's (CMUPD) practices and voted on special allocations for men's water polo and Bhangra in the Burgh last Thursday, Nov. 4.
During their general body meeting (GBM), Senate held a discussion with Former Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey and Dr. Brenda Bond-Fortier of 21st Century Policing Solutions (21CP). 21CP is reviewing CMUPD's policies at the request of Carnegie Mellon. During the meeting, Senators gave input on what CMUPD could do better and shared their experiences with CMUPD. 
Carnegie Mellon asked 21CP to review CMUPD to fulfill a commitment made in July 2020 as part of the university's commitments to confront racism. 21CP is holding two community listening sessions in November, where students can share their experiences with CMUPD. Students can also email their input to 21CP at voicesofcmu@21cpsolutions.com.
Senate also voted on special allocations. First, the men's water polo club requested $5,165 from Senate after a representative for the club said at the GBM that they unexpectedly doubled their membership this year. Due to the increased membership, the costs associated with competing increased, leading to the shortfall. Senate voted 24-0-1 in favor of the special allocation.
In addition, Bhangra in the Burgh, which hosts an annual Bhangra competition, requested $2,500. Representatives told Senate was due to decreased ticket sales caused by the pandemic. Senate also voted in favor of the request 25-0-1.

During their first week on campus, many Class of 2025+ students were unimpressed with their initial introduction to food at Carnegie Mellon University. O-Week activities may have distracted students from the limited options available, but Carnegie Mellon dining staff were fully aware. In an interview with The Tartan, one service worker (A) who wished to remain anonymous recalled that “orientation was a wreck,” giving a glimpse into the mounting tension that has emerged between dining staff and administration. 
A new contract was agreed upon on Sept. 30 after weeks of negotiations between Chartwells (Carnegie Mellon’s third-party dining management) and SEIU 32BJ (university dining staff’s workers’ union). This was confirmed in a statement by Chartwells’ PR department. The union demanded free health coverage and an 80-cent hourly raise this year, followed by 40-cent raises for the next two years, according to a staff member (B), who also wished to remain anonymous. 
Had Chartwells failed to meet these demands, workers were ready to strike. The raise promised by the company was expected to take effect on Oct. 1, but staff member B said that some dining staff — who are paid weekly — have not yet seen a change in their wages. Mike Tokarek, the operational director of Chartwells at Carnegie Mellon, responded in an emailed statement that these staff members “have now been retroactively paid to reflect the raise.” Yet, service workers maintain that, as of Nov. 4, they have still not received a raise. Their health insurance is set to begin in December. The union was also able to negotiate two additional paid holidays on Juneteenth and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday.
Every five years, the contract between Carnegie Mellon University and its foodservice management expires. During this time, dining companies place bids to partner with the university. The last time this occurred — July 2018 — the university switched from CulinArt Group to Chartwells Higher Education. Both are owned by Compass Group, one of the biggest foodservice providers in the world. On its website, the parent company boasted its 2019 revenue at $20.1 billion. Chartwells Higher Education provides food services at 300 college campuses across the country, including the University of Pittsburgh. Frustrations expressed by Carnegie Mellon service workers parallel similar experiences at other schools. Northwestern and DePaul University dining staff (both managed by Chartwells) have gone on strike within the past month to demand higher wages and better benefits. 
The transition to Chartwells at Carnegie Mellon was significant. “Everything was chaotic,” said service worker A. The worker described the introduction of entirely “new management … [and a] whole new staff of team members.” Changes also included remodeling, new location names, and different food concepts. 
Traditionally, the next cycle of applications for new dining management would begin in the next few months (having reached the five-year mark since Chartwells began in 2018). Joe Beaman, the director of Carnegie Mellon’s Dining Services department, explained in an emailed statement to The Tartan that, “In response to the effects of COVID-19, CMU extended our contract with Chartwells for an additional two-year term.” Chartwells did not extend the same opportunity to its employees: when the pandemic hit, Chartwells froze wages for employees, forcing many to apply for unemployment compensation, according to service worker A. The issue of frozen wages was compounded by the fact that workers’ 32BJ union contract expired mid-pandemic and that Chartwells did not provide workers with health insurance. 
Staff member B, who has worked at the university for nearly a decade, explained that CulinArt provided health coverage during the first few years of their contract. In contrast, Chartwells never offered coverage. The worker said this was especially difficult during the pandemic, “when everyone needed it the most.” Carnegie Mellon workers’ wages — which did not change from CulinArt to Chartwells — were also lower than their counterparts at the University of Pittsburgh and Duquesne University. Under the Sept. 30 contract, wages are now comparable to these schools, although the 80-cent raise has yet to be reflected in workers’ weekly payments.
When Carnegie Mellon returned to in-person learning this fall, the dining staff’s focus shifted from pandemic concerns to management pandemonium. Service worker A recounted that nearly “everyone was terminated” in management; only four managers were rehired when campus food services reopened. Most of the current dining staff have cultivated long careers at the university and returned this year. This has caused tension between workers who are already familiar with their jobs and management that is fairly new to the scene, according to worker B. The worker said that many of the new managers correct veteran staff members on routines they have been performing for years and “don’t know how to talk to the employees.” In one incident, a manager reportedly grabbed a staff member by the wrist in a demonstration of force. Workers filed a grievance through the union in response. Chartwells administration reprimanded the manager, who has acted more respectfully but “still doesn’t know how to talk to people,” according to the same worker. 
Part of the problem stems from Chartwells’ lack of training and team building for its employees, according to staff member B. The worker lamented that the company does not currently require managers to undergo sensitivity training and that they “take their time getting back to” service workers’ questions. In years past, CulinArt hosted a meeting for all staff members to “boost morale” each fall. No such large-scale, organized gathering has occurred since Chartwells assumed management operations. “It’s not even fun anymore to come to work. We used to have a blast,” the worker reminisced. “I just want this company to go, to be honest.” 
In an emailed statement to The Tartan, Tokarek wrote that while Chartwells does require “a variety of training programs … we recognize that these were not prioritized as they should have been when associates were onboarded this year.” In recent weeks, Chartwells has initiated sensitivity training into “daily huddles” and team meetings “to make sure the messaging is consistent, ongoing and heard by all.” 
Work has also been busier since the pandemic due to a debilitating staff shortage. Tokarek suggested that this was concurrent with national labor shortages seen in recent months. The company has been attempting to garner new hires by streamlining the application process and implementing signing bonuses and extra benefits. In response to staff shortages, dining locations have become increasingly reliant on outsourced vendors, prepackaged foods, and earlier closing times. According to Beaman, the dining team is encouraging students to seek part-time employment with Carnegie Mellon food services.
Chartwells told union members it had not received any applicants “with clean background checks,” according to service worker B, who was skeptical of this explanation. The worker’s mistrust of management also stems from its ambiguity in posting position announcements. When a new spot opens, they explained, Chartwells seldom announces it publicly, tending to favor new hires over veteran employees. “Chartwells does whatever it wants,” the worker said with a shrug.
Chartwells’ vagueness particularly comes into focus at Entropy+, the aptly-named market on campus. Whereas CulinArt included visible prices on all its products, Chartwells consistently excludes sale labels, according to worker A. In some Entropy sections — including the chip, candy, and canned food aisles — no prices are listed at all. In others, price tags are sparsely and often incorrectly matched to items. On Oct. 13, for example, Daiya Cheddar Style Cheezy Mac was marked as Gnocchi Cauliflower ($9.99). Its correct label (“Daiya Cheddar”), hanging below a row of Cocoa Loco Chewy Bars, listed the price as $6.99. The same box can be bought at Target for $4.19, 40 percent less than the Entropy price. “Prices have gotten outrageous,” service worker B said, adding that each year, students watch the expense for shampoo (currently missing a price tag) and other commodities creep higher. 
Another difference between CulinArt and Chartwells is the food itself. The former company, according to staff member B, ensured all meals were made in-house with fresh ingredients. Chartwells, in comparison, relies more heavily on outsourced, pre-packaged sandwiches. Carnegie Mellon’s Red Plan is currently 145 percent more expensive than the national average among university meal plans. Pizza that was once made from scratch under CulinArt is now baked from thawed dough shipped frozen to campus, members of the Class of 2025+ were served undercooked chicken during O-week, and students have reported moldy food at various locations across campus.
Many workers are hopeful that conditions will improve with time and, more importantly, the implementation of the Sept. 30 contract.

Brrr! Do you feel that? That’s the chill of one world leader throwing shade at another. And speaking of shade, maybe we should invest in a global umbrella, what with the world being on fire and all. To anyone who participates in edging (you know who-o-o-o you are), the G20 Summit is like Lollapalooza. It’s a bunch of people cramped together who are on the verge of agreement, but can’t quite get there. And it’s really hot. And you vaguely feel like there’s a creepy older man who wants to take you to his tent. The “20” comes from the fact that it represents the world’s 20 largest economies, and the “G” comes from “Gee, I wonder when anything will happen?” 
This year’s G20 Summit took place in Rome, Italy, and was conducted largely between tours of the Colosseum and spaghetti eating contests. World leaders from countries including India, France, Canada, South Africa, and fan favorite U.S.A. congealed to discuss scary topics such as “Amazon rainforest: friend or foe?”, “How to deliver COVID vaccines by owl” (Fumio Kishida is a surprisingly big Potterhead), and “How many mistresses is it ok to have and why is that number at least four?” In a geriatric replica of the Summer Olympics, humanity’s best strove to tackle the most existential threats to mankind. Ok, maybe “tackle” is a strong word. More like wrestle. But not wrestle-wrestle. Think WWE. Yes, our world leaders congregated to throw chairs at climate change and supplex the supply line shortage.
Now, Thanksgiving is coming up so I want you to imagine a scene as old as time itself. You’ve invited all of your family over in an attempt to broker peace, but inevitably, one of your uncles decides that one of your aunts has parked too close to their SUV, and they won't be able to pull out of the driveway. Your mom gets angry at her brother for implying that they want to leave early, and your cousins on your dad’s side-snicker at how ridiculous that side of the family is. You look over at mee-maw and think maybe she’s finally kicked the bucket, but no, she’s just in a food coma and has slumped over her iPad that right now is playing a Tucker Carlson trap remix that your cousin made on FL Studio. Now imagine that each one of those people has both nuclear weapons and enough industrial waste to cause two, maybe three, extinction events.
Wasn’t that fun? It’s great to stretch our imaginations from time to time. Back to business. One major criticism of the G20 Summit is that it did not seem to do enough. News anchors, journalists, and hippie free-thinkers all had some “ish” to say about the results of this year’s Doomsday Summer Camp. One “Golden State Inquirer” lefty pointed out that not enough global spending was going to be put toward research into green technology. The nerve! We already got a handwritten promise from Chancellor Merkel that she would give her granddaughter twenty whole Euros if her wind turbine got first place at the science fair. What a lady! Or what about Joe Biden’s remark that he swore he would look in the Oval Office sofa when he got home for some extra cash to give the EPA? There’s gotta be at least two Benjamins in the POTUS La-Z-Boy. Another snivelling journalist, this time out of “Las Vegas Afternoon Sun,” remarked that COVID relief to developing nations was not focused on nearly long enough. This is completely ignoring the fact that in a stroke of genius (and after an actual stroke, no less), Biden proposed re-designing Flintstones gummies to be in the shape and image of local deities in the developing world. What a masterstroke in global health-care and cultural sensitivity! I, for one, would love to nab a bottle of Shiva gummies for me and mine.
Was the G20 Summit a futile attempt to fight the mounting crises that threaten our world? Was it a veritable drop in the ocean of sweat that we will need to combat a world that is trying to kill us back? Was this summit a congregation of ineffective and self-serving juggernauts who are more concerned with whether or not there will be snacks on the rocket that takes them to the Martian colony than our own planet? Do we need to accept that our world leaders are not the spearheads of change but rather the foibles of any necessary revolution? Might it be that asking a series of leading questions is overly snarky and comes across as ham-fisted? No.

With its star-studded cast and success within the Marvel comic book universe, “Eternals” came to be one of the most anticipated movies of the year. Yet, according to critics, it did nothing to fulfill its purpose of rejuvenating the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after the end of the well-loved “Avengers” franchise. As an avid follower of said universe, you couldn’t imagine my excitement about the release of this movie. I walked into the theater ecstatic and left surprised.
To its credit, “Eternals” was a good movie on paper. It scored well in terms of diversity and brought onto the big screen many well-loved actors. These included Angelina Jolie, who hasn’t made waves in Hollywood since “Maleficent 2,” Kit Harington (aka Jon Snow), the comedic relief that is Kumail Nanjiani, and Salma Hayek. In addition, the special effects took the movie into a world of its own by threading highlights of gold through each and every scene, lighting up the theater with a heavenly glow. More importantly, the story had more twists and turns than have ever been seen in a Marvel movie, and, for the first time in a long time, I was genuinely surprised by how the story played out. However, there were many more faults to this movie than credits.
A major source of controversy was the abrupt introduction of these characters into the MCU. Unlike characters such as Thanos or Ego (Starlord’s dad), the Eternals had rarely been mentioned in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, yet they were suddenly featured characters. Furthermore, if they had existed this entire time, where were they during the Blip (you know, the thing that wiped out half the universe?). Marvel’s response to this was that the Eternals were instructed by a celestial being to only help Earth when deviants (monsters created by celestials to hurry along evolution) attacked. Even though this was an obvious plot convenience, it baffles me that none of the gods and celestial beings who were already in the cinematic universe ever hinted at the Eternals’ existence. Such is the Marvel way. Instead, the producers and director decided to spontaneously introduce a group of immortal beings into the universe with the hope that the audience would accept them with open arms. I don’t know about you, but this seems like too much of a risk to take with a movie with a budget as large as $200 million.
Secondly, it may be a well-known fact that some Marvel characters are named after the gods of Greek mythology, but this movie took that to a whole new level by giving the Greek gods nicknames. The audience was subject to gems like Thena, short for Athena, and Phastos, short for Hephaestus. The last one, especially, kept me from taking the character seriously because every time I heard his name I was reminded of Festus, the dragon from the Rick Riordan series, “Heroes of Olympus.” While the origin stories matched up, it was not necessary to butcher these names that form the foundation of Hellenism.
Lastly, Marvel has a storied past of attempting to copy DC characters, and they have failed miserably every time. Somehow, in this movie, they failed even worse. The character Ikaris, an Eternal with super-strength, laser eyes, and the ability to fly, acts suspiciously like Superman during the Zack Snyder cut of “Justice League.” The way he flies (chest up with his arms in front of him), his laser vision, and even his hair are modeled after the beloved DC character. Yet, Marvel went to extreme lengths to establish the difference. In a scene from the movie, Phastos’ son refers to him as Superman and comments on his cape, and Ikaris specifically said, with a disdained look on his face, that he does not wear a cape. While I have no qualms with Marvel attempting to rip off highly successful characters, they should at least be willing to accept it and acknowledge the brilliance that is DC Comics’ Superman.
In conclusion, “Eternals” was an enjoyable movie. The story line was well-built and the cast was well-chosen, yet the sudden addition of the characters to an established universe we have all come to love was jarring. Furthermore, I can’t say the movie would have been as good without the wit of Jolie and the other actors on the screen. I believe that is where the movie failed the most, that its success is credited to the big names on the screen more than the movie itself. It’s like going to watch a movie just because Zendaya was in the trailer, except this time instead of being a side character, she was in the entire movie (cough, cough “Dune”). Despite its various shortcomings, I would give it an 8/10. So if you have time, go catch “Eternals” at a movie theater near you.

As students, we can all appreciate the value of an education. Whether you spend your days hunched over sheet music, toiling with wires, or researching public policy, your education forms the basis for who you are. This is why the current conversation about education in America is so relevant and why the Virginia gubernatorial race is something we all should be concerned about. 
First, what is the debate on education? The main controversy surrounds whether critical race theory should be taught in schools, particularly to children. Critical race theory was first popularized in the legal vernacular in the 70s and 80s where it was used to discuss ways to fight racial discrimination through the legal system. Theorists looked beyond an ostensible understanding of American legal systems and postulated that racism is ingrained in American institutions in a way that individual legal reforms will not be able to undo. Additionally, critical race theory acknowledges the tendency of racist forces to push back legal progress, rendering it significantly less effective. However, it is certainly not one singular mindset, but rather an acknowledgment of the history of American racism and the way it functions today.
Since summer 2020, as people all around the country attempt to confront modern racism, conservative media and the Republican Party have challenged critical race theory as a series of fallacies about the American government that makes judgments about white people. This was furthered under the guise of questions concerning if parents should be able to have a say over whether or not their children were taught critical race theory in school. The debate became the backbone of newly elected Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin’s campaign which advocated for “parents’ rights” and took issue with critical race theory. While it is not an official part of the public school curriculum in Virginia (or other states), it is still a school of thought that has caught the attention of voters across the country. Conservatives have frequently used the term critical race theory to essentially argue that public schools are teaching progressive ideologies to children, somehow indoctrinating students into leftism. 
This idea has pushed many school boards and parents into action, creating legislation that bans critical race theory. In Youngkin’s campaign, he even declared he would ban critical race theory on his first day in office. Youngkin was able to succeed by taking on education aiming to censor topics from critical race theory to sexual content, which successfully angered people, particularly parents, into voting. This seemingly worked out for Youngkin, as he was able to win over both Trump-supporting and non-Trump-supporting conservatives and additionally win in areas that Biden won by a not-insignificant margin in 2020.
You may be asking, okay, why does this matter to me? Why should I care that some governor wants to tackle education? First, the way we look at education informs how we operate as a society and what we are willing to think critically about. As people across the country try to push critical race theory out of education, not only are they keeping the next generation from having the opportunity to think about race but also are making it more taboo to talk about these issues. While parents and conservatives may sincerely believe they are protecting their children, in reality, they are just postponing the inevitable inward look we all must take to understand our role in racist systems. The Virginia gubernatorial election only reflects just how eager people are to do so.
We have no qualms with parents having a say over their children’s education, as that is their prerogative. However, the problem comes when parents try to completely change public education to be palatable to their own beliefs, affecting every child, which serves to corrupt early education entirely. It is fine to allow parents to opt their children out of certain topics, but school curricula should be left to experts that are trained in designing education that is based in critical thinking. The training in critical thinking that children receive in their education is essential to their consumption of information later in life, which is especially prevalent today considering all the talk surrounding “fake news.” It is up to parents whether their child is allowed to be exposed to that.
