Coming off a tough double-overtime draw versus Ohio Northern in their home opener, the Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team wanted to make a statement in the second game of their seven-game long homestand. While the game might not have been a statement, a 1-0 win against No. 18 Wheaton College and a second straight shutout give credence to the team’s ability and sets the stage for improved performances over the next few games.
The results mean that the Tartans improve their record on the season to 3-0-1 while their most recent opponents drop to 3-2. The still undefeated Tartans will hope that this early season form can provide cause for more celebration over the next few games for the home crowd.
The scoreline does not reflect the dominance of the Tartans as the finishing touch or the final ball was the only thing missing in several moves that could have ended up as goals.
After an edgy first half in which neither team created much, a combination of first-year Kaili Bruch and sophomore Tori Iatarola created the first goal of the season for midfielder Iatarola.
Overall, the team had nine shots to their opponent’s three, while they had three shots on target to their opponent’s two. The goal resulted in much more open play and Wheaton’s only shot on goal of the second half also came late as they searched and pressed for an equalizer.
Sophomore goalkeeper Sarah Mahler earned her second shutout with some confident keeping and marshaling of her defense. She kept her composure for both shots on goal and earned a first win as the Tartan’s goalkeeper.
Against their next opponents, the Tartans will be looking to improve their play in the final third in order to ensure more goals. Despite dominating this game from the off, had the 88th-minute shot by Sydney Sharkey of Wheaton been better and out of Mahler’s reach, they could have been staring at two disappointing draws to begin the homestand.
More adventurous play with the ball and focused pressure off the ball will be required to generate complete performances. While this is all easier said than done, the team currently has a great combination of newcomers and experience to effectively maximize their chances of winning every game.
For their next game, the Tartans face Grove City on Friday, Sept. 18 at 7 p.m. The team will not only be hoping to continue their good run of form and remain undefeated, but also will hope to score some goals to provide the several fans that come out to watch them regularly a memorable night.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s volleyball team returned to campus for its home opener on Wednesday to face the St. Vincent College Bearcats. The Tartans got off to a quick 3–0 start in the first set, setting the tone early as they rallied to a 25–9 score and took the first set. The second set began with a fiercely contested rally, the ball traveling over the net many times before finally falling in the Tartans’ favor. The Bearcats, undaunted by the Tartans’ early lead, continued to fight tooth and nail. Though the Tartans were at one point blowing away St. Vincent, the Bearcats caught up, eventually gaining an 18–17 lead.
The Tartans, however, proved to be resilient, refusing to back down from their surging rivals. They were able to turn the tables and take the second set 25–20. From there, the Tartans continued to increase their lead against St. Vincent, taking the third set 25–10 and winning the match 3–0. First–year outside hitter Sydney Bauer led the team with five kills, and four other team members each notched four kills.
The Tartans have dominated their competition so far, having won all seven of their games and lost only one set following their victory against the Bearcats. Offensively, the Tartans have proven to be very adept at earning kills. First–year outside hitter and defensive specialist Lauren Mueller, junior middle blocker Jackie Gibbons, and first–year right–side hitter Sarah Jurgens have accumulated the most kills for the team, etching 71, 61, and 59 kills respectively. Junior setter Emily Newton has played a huge role in helping set up the offense, marking 215 assists. Defensively, they have recorded many digs that would have otherwise resulted in opposing scores; junior libero and defensive specialist Molly Higgins has led the way for the team with a whopping 94 digs.
The Tartans’ efforts this season have already resulted in a few decorations. Both Higgins and Mueller were honored by the Eastern Conference Athletic Conference (ECAC) following their strong season–opening performances. Higgins was named Corvias ECAC South Region Libero of the Week, and Mueller was named Corvias ECAC South Region Rookie of the Week. Head coach Kim Kelly earned her 450th career win and 200th win at Carnegie Mellon after the Tartans defeated Haverford en route to their victory at the Haverford/Swarthmore Invitational Tournament.
The Tartans have gone on to win all four of their games at the Marcia French Memorial Tournament. The Tartans first defeated Thiel College with a 3–0 victory, winning by 25–15 in the first set, 25–18 in the second, and 25–15 in the third. Gibbons led the Tartans with 11 kills. The Tartans then beat Buffalo State 3–1, winning by 25–8, 25–17, and 25–15 in the first, second, and fourth sets and losing by 25-20 in the third set. Bauer led the team with a season-high 13 kills.
The Tartans next faced Franciscan University and came out with a 3–0 victory, winning by 25–12 in the first set, 25–16 in the second, and 25–22 in the third. The Tartans’ final game of the tournament was a 3–1 victory against Westminster College, winning by 25–8 in the first set, losing by 25–23 in the second, winning by 25–16 in the third, and winning 25–13 in the fourth.
The Tartans will return to action at the Days Inn Blue Jay Classic.

Usually, the Super Bowl is won by one of the two or three teams that everyone expects to win the Super Bowl. Occasionally, however, an underdog breaks through that ceiling, like the Ravens in 2013 or the Giants in 2012.
This article takes two teams who are not part of the triumvirate of Super Bowl favorites (the Packers, Seahawks, and Patriots) and makes the case for why they might be the surprise team hoisting the Lombardi this February in Santa Clara.
Indianapolis Colts
While many people see the Colts as a close second to the Patriots or even a favorite to win the AFC, betting markets still see the Patriots and even the likely declining Broncos as surer bets to reach Super Bowl Sunday. This underestimation is misguided.
The main reason is the Colts’ offseason. To start this offseason, the Colts had four problem spots. First, the running back group was an absolute disaster, with Trent Richardson serving as the symbol of a group that failed to ever do much of anything. Second, the defensive line was weak, as outside linebacker Bjoern Werner failed to justify his second round draft slot. Third, Reggie Wayne’s departure left a huge hole for a receiver across from T.Y. Hilton. Finally, the offensive line was a mess, with tackle Gosder Cherlius simply not living up to his billing.
Other spots such as the secondary weren’t great Vontae Davis proved he was one of the league’s best cornerbacks last year, but one cornerback doesn’t make a secondary. General manager Ryan Grigson took those into account as well in free agency even though they weren’t disasters.
The Colts fixed all of these problems. Former San Francisco running back Frank Gore, though no longer a star, is a competent running back who can add yards to the end of a play with his patience and cutting ability. Former Philadelphia outside linebacker Trent Cole continued to play very well last year and will add a much needed extra weapon to replace the Colts’ long time star Robert Mathis. Former Texans wide receiver Andre Johnson brings Reggie Wayne’s experience and possession receiving style while arguably being an improvement talent wise. Former Philadelphia guard Todd Herremans has been great every year he has not been injured (as he was last season). He’ll help shore up the interior of a line that, for years, has looked like it was hired by the rest of the AFC South to get quarterback Andrew Luck killed. Safety Mike Adams and cornerback Darius Butler could help shore up the secondary.
All of the offseason changes are reasons to think the team will improve, while not even mentioning that Luck is entering his fourth year. He still has plenty of room to grow, and he has gotten tangibly better with both his accuracy and decision making through each of his first three seasons. 
It seems extremely likely that the Colts will waltz through their division. However, with the Broncos weakened and the Patriots losing their secondary and starting three rookies on the offensive line, the Colts might face weak competition all the way to the Super Bowl. There’s no reason to exclude them from the discussion of who can take home the prize.
Dallas Cowboys
Last year the Cowboys had an incredible offense, driven by a powerful and skilled offensive line. In their positions, Quarterback Tony Romo and wide receiver Dez Bryant were among the league’s best. While this team may miss running back DeMarco Murray, running backs rely on their offensive lines to break open holes. 
Murray was not considered a particularly good back until the Dallas offensive line went supernova two years ago. Replacing Murray with running backs Joseph Randle and Darren McFadden will likely work fine.
The defensive side is more questionable, but it lacked talent last year, too. Rookie defensive end Randy Gregory almost certainly would have been a high first round pick if he wasn’t caught committing the apparently unforgivable crime of smoking pot. The return of linebacker Sean Lee adds more talent, and Defensive Coordinator Rod Marinelli has his sterling reputation for a reason. The Cowboys’ troubled defense last season was only slightly below average, and still made it within one play of the NFC Championship game.
With an improvement on the defense and the offense continuing to hum, it’s possible the Cowboys can finally shed the endless ridicule of the last six seasons and grab Super Bowl 50.

Women’s Tennis
The Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team competed in the Carnegie Mellon Invitational against Duquesne University this weekend. Overall, Carnegie Mellon picked up nine of 21 singles matches and four of 10 doubles matches to finish 13–18 overall against the Division I competition.
First-year Jamie Vizelman won both her singles match at the top of the ladder by a score of 8–2 and also her doubles match along with senior Brooke Tsu 6–3. Tsu took home her singles match as well 6–3, 4–6, 10–7.
Vizelman also won a second singles match 8–1. Sophomores Kalyani Naryan and Cori Sidell were the other Tartans to snag second singles wins. Naryan took her matches 7–6 (8–0), 6–4 and 8–1 while Sidell took her matches 7–6 (3–0), 3–6, 10–4 and 9–7.
A pair of first-years, Marina Selenica and Charlotte Deiss, rounded out the Tartan winners tallying victories of 6–2, 4–6, 10–8 and 8–3, respectively.
Vizelman also took a second doubles match teaming up with junior Nicholle Torres to win 7–6 (6–0). Deiss also won a pair of doubles matches. When she was teamed with sophomore Katie Lai, the pair took home their match 6–4. When Deiss paired up with senior Abby Hamstra, the two won 6–2.
The Tartans will continue competition on Friday, Sept. 18 to take on Grove City.
Men’s Tennis
The Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team competed in the Carnegie Mellon Invitational as well this weekend, picking up 11 of 18 singles matches and four of eight doubles matches to finish 15–11 overall.
Four Tartans were able to rack up multiple wins. First-year Vayum Arora was able to notch victories by counts of 6–3, 6–2 and 6–4, 6–1. Junior Kunal Wadwani took two matches 6–0, 6–3 and 8–1. Sophomore Edward Ang put together two wins by scores of 3–6, 6–3, 10–8, and 8–0. First-year Daniel Levine was also able to pull out a pair of wins by scores of 6–3, 6–7 (0–8), 10–6 and 9–8 (3–0).
Five additional Tartans took down their competition. Senior Abhishek Alla won a match 4–6, 6–2, 10–4. Sophomore Connor O’Kelly managed a 6–4, 6–2 victory. Junior Kiril Kirkov won 7–5, 6–4.
In doubles competition, a team of Alla and senior Yuvraj Kumar picked up their match 6–1. Arora and sophomore Andrew Pratt won 6–2. Arora also took another doubles match, this time joining forces with Kirkov to win 6–3. Ang and sophomore Matt Seifert won their match by a score of 7–5.
The men’s tennis team will continue their schedule Friday, September 18 against Grove City.
Men’s Soccer
The Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team dropped a close 4–3 match in its first lost of the season this weekend against No. 9 Kenyon College. Senior midfielder William Webb put the Tartans up early with a goal just past the five minute mark. The Lords tied the match but sophomore forward Ryan Stinebaugh put the Tartans up in the 16th minute, giving them a lead that would last until the second half. In a twenty minute period from the 69th to the 89th minute, three Kenyon goals stopped the Tartans’ winning streak at three despite a last minute goal by Stinebaugh to drop 4–3.
The Tartans had been undefeated until this match. The Tartans will continue competition Sunday afternoon at 4 p.m. as they take on Wooster.

Senior quarterback Andrew Hearon prepares for his last football season with as much hope as ever for the team’s success. The civil engineering major has found on the team a consistent, positive culture that has remained as supportive as it was when he first came onto campus unsure of what the future lay in store.
Sports have followed Hearon through his whole life. “I’ve always had a big interest in sports at an early age,” Hearon said, citing his involvement in flag football, basketball, and baseball since he was four years old. As he grew older, he settled on football as his sport of choice, becoming “pretty successful” as he got into high school. At the Metro Christian Academy in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Hearon led the team to the state semifinals his junior and senior year, and was named Gatorade Player of the Year in his senior year.
Turning his eyes toward college, Hearon wanted more than just a shot at athletic glory. “What was most important was finding a good balance between an athletic program I wanted to be in and an academic program I wanted to attend,” he said. Going to Carnegie Mellon gave him “a big change academically.” Much like many first-years, he came onto campus with an unwavering vision for his future. “I wanted to major in engineering because I knew I was decent at math and science,” he said.
As the years went by, however, Hearon learned a lot about what he really wanted to do with his future. “College helped me decide engineering’s not really what I want to do. When I’m done here, I’ll be entering the financial industry.”
He advises those who are uncertain about going through with their intended major to seek out different avenues of interest since college is the ideal time in life to examine what they really want to do.
Though his academic life has taken a few twists and turns, Hearon has been able to rely on football to provide stability. “Football helped smooth out everything.” From his first practice before orientation to his final season, Hearon has made a large number of friends. “The people have really made this school special.” He has attributed the constant positive atmosphere to the coaching staff, allowing him to see the team differently yet recognize the team he first joined as a first-year. Hearon has emerged as a leader on and off the field, and he has earned a few accolades, such as an All-UAA Honorable Mention for his performance last season.
As his playing career winds down, Hearon is considering coaching as a way to stay involved in the game. “I would like to get into coaching at the high school level.” Although he knows that he won’t be able to play the game as much in the future, “football will never really leave.”

In the race to put zero-emission vehicles on the road, plug-in electric cars have dramatically increased in popularity in recent years. Tesla Motors, along with other manufacturers, has already found success in bringing their “green” vehicles into the automotive market. Trailing behind plug-in electric cars, however, is an alternative class of vehicle powered by hydrogen fuel cells. These vehicles offer many benefits, including sourcing energy from both renewables and fossil fuels, trumping combustion engines in terms of efficiency and leaving nothing in their tracks but a trail of water vapor. Researchers from Carnegie Mellon, including Shawn Litster, a mechanical engineering and materials science and engineering professor, have worked to set these vehicles on the road to widespread adoption.
The main focus of the team’s research is a type of hydrogen fuel cell called a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC), which can power automobiles by capturing energy from a reaction between hydrogen fuel and oxygen gas. As the hydrogen fuel combines with oxygen from the atmosphere to form water, the flow of electrons between the two reactants generates the current used to drive the electric motors of the vehicle.
Although hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have been built and tested with promising results, taking these prototypes from the research phase to the dealership is a much bigger challenge due to obstacles such as high production costs. The current production cost of a fuel cell vehicle — nearly twice that of a vehicle using an internal combustion engine — greatly exceeds the price that even those with the deepest pockets would willingly pay. The high cost of today’s hydrogen fuel cells is mostly due to the platinum catalyst needed for electron transport, the process that generates the electrical current to power the vehicle. Researchers believe that reducing the amount of platinum is the most efficient way to bring down the overall cost of the vehicle. 
Previous attempts to reduce the required mass of this precious metal have been generally unsuccessful. “The key to lowering the cost is to reduce the amount of platinum,” Litster said in a university press release. “But, as industry and researchers attempt to do this, they encounter a previously-neglected resistance in the cathode that prevents further platinum reductions.” In this way, the main obstacle to reducing fuel cell costs becomes understanding this resistance.
“This resistance causes a surprising amount of power loss, and its origin is not well understood,” Litster said in an interview with The Tartan. “Significant research and development efforts have been focused on trying to better understand it in order to remedy the situation; however, the field has been somewhat split between two hypotheses as to what is the cause of this resistance.”
According to Litster, the first hypothesis focused on reduced oxygen permeability, and subsequently reduced electron transfer, in the extremely thin, nanoscale polymer films that cover the platinum catalyst. The other hypothesis questioned whether the electrolyte in the solution could be poisoning the platinum catalyst and reducing its efficacy, which could also lead to a decreased flow of electric current. This split became the focus of Litster’s research, which ultimately brought strong evidence against the first of these hypotheses.
In order to determine which of these hypotheses was correct, Lister’s team began by separating the platinum catalyst from the polymer films and measuring the resistance associated with polymers of various thicknesses. They determined that even using films as thin as 30 nanometers did not dramatically affect transport properties. Because the films did not impact resistances much, it’s likely that they aren’t the problem. This means that the second hypothesis is the more likely one. 
“The short term effect [of this research] is that oxygen transport resistance is not as much of a mystery anymore,” said William Epting, a Carnegie Mellon PhD candidate in mechanical engineering who worked with Litster on his research. “Now that we have a better idea of where the resistance comes from, we can figure out how to mitigate it by changing the way the electrode is made.” 
This discovery, published in the journal Langmuir, has shifted the focus of the research toward the second hypothesis, which involved the electrolyte solution. The researchers hope that by focusing on the reaction between the electrolyte and the platinum catalyst, they will be able to further understand the cause of the resistance and, therefore, help speed along the commercialization of fuel cell electric vehicles.

Photography is the process and the art of transcribing light. The modern discipline was initially born from the marriage between 19th-century chemistry concepts and ancient optical philosophy dating back to 470 B.C.E.
The first camera was called the “camera obscura,” or “darkened room” in Latin. This device could be as large as a free-standing room or a mid-sized box; light would enter from a hole on one side and could be reproduced, upside-down, on the other side. In this sense, it was more of a projector than a camera; in order to preserve the image, the artist would have to trace it onto a piece of paper.
In the early 1800s, chemistry was introduced into the world of photography when a potter named Thomas Wedgewood partnered with a chemist named Humphry Davy to experiment with the camera obscura and silver nitrate. Their interest in silver nitrate came from earlier observations about silver compounds and their light-sensitive properties. In the 1770s, Jean Senebier, a Swiss botanist, had discovered that by focusing light through     a lens, the silver-darkening process could be sped up. This chemical knowledge, when put to use by Wedgewood and Davy, provided the basis for creating concrete photographs.
Wedgewood’s experiments were the first known attempts at preserving the images of the camera obscura and earned him the title of the first photographer. His experiments, however, were unsuccessful. The duo was able to project the images onto sheets treated with silver nitrate, but were unable to arrest the process and stop the silver from reacting to light. This resulted in the creation of an image, but eventually the entire sheet would be discolored.
In 1826, a French inventor named Joseph Niepce created a process called heliography, which produced images on glass or metal by using bitumen, a natural asphalt which hardened when exposed to the sun. After exposure, the metal plate would be cleaned with lavender oil so that only the hardened bitumen remained, resulting in an image. This process created the first surviving photograph, called “View from the Window at Le Gras.” This technique was the predecessor for more modern photographical processes, such as the daguerreotype process.
In 1839, Louis Daguerre publicly announced the release of the daguerreotype, the first commercial photographical process. The birth of modern photography is largely synonymous with the birth of the daguerreotype. This process involved multiple chemical treatments of polished silver-plated copper sheets, which made the surface light sensitive. The surface could then be exposed in a camera for as little as a few seconds to produce an image. The surface was then chemically treated to remove its light sensitivity, and covered with glass for preservation. 
Daguerreotypes created ethereal images which did not rest squarely on the metal plate but seemed to float above it, giving the image an illusion of realism that isn’t found in more modern techniques. Daguerre’s process was widely popular until the 1860s, when new techniques superseded the daguerreotype in cost and efficiency. Film cameras eventually replaced the camera obscura as the medium of creation, but the heart behind the process — light focused onto a photosensitive surface — was very much conserved.
In the modern day, photography has become more  a technical art than a chemical one. Instead of film, modern cameras use silicone chips with millions of light-sensitive diodes — small semiconductors that record information on a single pixel of the image. When the shutter opens, these diodes record the brightness they are exposed to and issue a charge corresponding with the amount of light — a higher charge for highlights and a lower charge for shadows. These diodes function much like the rods within the human eye, recording only brightness, not color. Color is created in photographs via the red/green/blue (RGB) system, which overlays these colors to create a single colored image.
Photography has not only a rich past but a burgeoning future; it is an art born of science and technology, and it is an art that will continue to develop within both disciplines.

The human body functions through a combination of millions of molecular interactions. In an effort to better understand the molecular interactions of a tumor suppressing protein, PTEN, a team of researchers from Carnegie Mellon University built on a key structural insight to establish the structure of the protein. The team was led by Mathias Loesche and Frank Heinrich, two professors from the physics department at Carnegie Mellon University. They hope that highlighting aspects of the protein’s stability and molecular interactions will enable other researchers to develop drugs to overcome the way the mutations in the protein could lead to the development of cancer.
As part of a collaboration that began five years ago, Loesche and Heinrich were approached by Alonzo H. Ross, a professor of biochemistry and molecular pharmacology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, to help obtain structural data about PTEN in an effort to better understand its involvement in cancer. 
Prior to the beginning of this project, published research on PTEN had highlighted its important role as a tumor-suppressing protein. In a healthy individual, the normal form of the protein acts as an enzyme at the cell membrane and plays a role in a complex biochemical reaction that is involved with regulating the cell’s growth and ability to divide. Many cancers stem from the loss of this regulation, without which cancerous cells can grow and divide out of control to produce a cancerous mass of cells. In individuals affected with certain cancers, mutations in the gene-encoding PTEN cause PTEN to be formed incorrectly, hindering its ability to interact with other molecules and carry out the necessary chemical reactions.
However, despite this superficial understanding that PTEN plays a role in disease prevalence, little was known about the complex mechanisms that mediate its interactions. To better understand these interactions, scientists often attempt to uncover the structure of the molecules to visualize them at the molecular level and understand how structure mediates function.
“PTEN belongs to a group of partially disordered proteins, which means it is very difficult to crystallize,” Heinrich said. 
The ability to crystallize is necessary in order to utilize mass spectrometry to determine the orientation of the molecules that make up the protein in 3-D space. To overcome this challenge, the team utilized small-angle-X-ray scattering (SAXS), which scatters X-rays through a solution containing the protein. Heinrich mentioned that this method is a much lower resolution approach than mass spectrometry, but does not require the protein to be crystallized. He also emphasized that “SAXS doesn’t directly give a structure of the protein; instead you get an envelope of the protein and you must use computational tools to arrange the molecules that make up the protein inside the envelope.”
SAXS has been used previously to explore PTEN, but it was always assumed to exist alone, as a monomer in solution. After looking at the data, Heinrich and his team hypothesized that PTEN exists in a dimerized form, where two identical copies of the protein are attached together. With this insight, they used the computational tool Rosetta to simulate the protein structure and docking within the envelope provided by the SAXS data.
They found that in the dimers, the C-terminal tails of the proteins may bind the two protein subunits in a cross-wise fashion, increasing their stability. Increased stability directly correlates to the protein’s ability to carry out reactions at the cell membrane.
The team also explored mutated forms of the protein to better understand how these deviations from the norm can impact the protein’s ability to function and lead to cancer. 
They determined that the mutated form cannot create dimers and will remain as monomeric subunits in solution.
“It was important to note that the SAXS data was collected from the protein in solution, whereas within a biological system, it will be near the membrane,” Heinrich said. In the future, the research team wants to better understand how the protein acts specifically at the membrane.
These insights provided by the new solution structure can give other researchers points of interest to target in the protein when developing drugs that could recover the function of a mutated form. 
The structure the team has found contributed to the understanding of PTEN and the complex molecular interactions in which it participates.

Several faculty members, students, and staff from Carnegie Mellon University attended the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Dailan, China last week. The WEF is a Swiss nonprofit foundation that, according to their website, “engages political, business, academic and other leaders of society in collaborative efforts to improve the state of the world.”
The WEF holds two conferences each year, the Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Dailan, and the WEF Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland in January. According to the WEF’s mission statement, both conferences attract decision-makers, experts and innovators to “define challenges, solutions and actions, always in the spirit of global citizenship.” Carnegie Mellon University is one out of 25 universities in the world to attend this event, and one out of only 12 universities in the United States. An even more impressive feat is that Carnegie Mellon’s fifteen person delegation — comprising faculty members, students, and staff — is the largest delegation among all universities that attended the conference.
Delegates from Carnegie Mellon included leading researchers in computer science, robotics, human computer interaction, machine learning, and information systems, to name a few. “Carnegie Mellon is always on the cutting edge of technology innovation, particularly technologies that collaborate with people to address the most pressing challenges of our time, so the WEF meetings are natural venues in which to share our ideas and demonstrate our technologies,” said Justine Cassell, Carnegie Mellon’s associate vice provost of Technology Strategy and Impact, in a university press release.
Topics discussed during the conference ranged from issues such as “What if machines outsmart us?” and “decoding cancer” to “What if scientists are the new chefs?” and “What if your mind could be read?” The Carnegie Mellon delegation participated in a variety of these discussions touching on various topics including computer science, machine learning, and robotics.
On the first day of the conference, Carnegie Mellon delegates presented an IdeasLab on “Machine Learning for Health.” In the session they discussed how machine learning can help predict neurodegenerative diseases, prevent epidemics, and aid individuals in the health industry such as doctors and health insurers. Various Carnegie Mellon delegates participated in this discussion, including Andrew Moore, dean of the School of Computer Science; Jason Hong, an associate professor in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute; Tom Mitchell, head of the Machine Learning Department; Daniel Neill, an associate professor of information systems; and Aarti Singh, an assistant professor of machine learning.
Carnegie Mellon also demonstrated advancements in robotics in a variety of presentations, such as in the exhibition “Meet the Robots,” organized by Cassell. In this exhibition, William Whittaker, a Carnegie Mellon professor of robotics, allowed participants of WEF to remotely drive Carnegie Mellon’s Andy Lunar Rover, which resides halfway across the world in West Mifflin, Pa. Ralph Hollis, another professor of robotics, showcased Ballbot, a robot that is similar in size and shape to a human, that moves while balancing atop a bowling-ball-sized sphere. 
Cassell also presented “virtual peers,” which are animated video characters that can hold a conversation with students, and have been used to aid autistic children and research the use of vernacular in schools. 
Cassell, Whittaker, and Hollis also all participated in a discussion panel on “Robots without Borders,” which focused on the topic of optimizing the incorporation of robotics into society to achieve societal improvements. Carnegie Mellon’s CREATE Lab also presented its Earth Time-Lapse technology, which aims at visualizing massive databases.
Many Carnegie Mellon faculty members were also recognized for their work at this event. Louis-Phillippe Morency, associate professor in Carnegie Mellon’s Language Technologies Institute was recognized as one of this year’s Young Scientists, a title given to leading contributors to science, engineering, or technology under the age of 40. Carnegie Mellon spinoff Neon, which was co-founded by the head of the Department of Psychology Michael Tarr and CEO Sophie Lebrecht, was recognized as one of the world’s 49 most promising technology pioneers.
Conferences such as the WEF’s Annual Meeting of the New Champions allow for leading researchers and innovators from around the world to share ideas and, hopefully, look toward an improved future. Public conference sessions and discussions of this year’s annual meeting are posted on WEF’s official website, and are available for streaming.

Human-like fossils discovered deep in South African cave
In a paper published last Thursday in the journal eLife, scientists discussed fossils that belong to a past human ancestor which were recently discovered deep within a cave in South Africa. During the excavation, led by Lee Berger, a professor of anthropology at the University of Arkansas, partial skeletons of males and females, young and old in age, were discovered. The species was named naledi and was grouped in the genus Homo, which is the genus of modern humans. 
While scientists are not sure when Homo naledi existed in Africa, researchers believe it could have been up to three million years ago. Individuals of this species have small, modern-looking teeth, humanlike feet, primitive-looking fingers and a small braincase. The fossils appeared to be located in a burial chamber, indicating that Homo naledi may have practiced ritual behaviors, a trait that is usually associated with later humans. Scientists believe that the unexpected findings may reveal more about the emergence of modern day humans, as well as spark the re-evaluation of what it means to be a human.

Smart immune cells allow neurons to heal themselves
Researchers at the University of North Carolina Eshelman School of Pharmacy, located in Chapel Hill, have re-engineered immune cells that are capable of producing and distributing protein that can initiate the growth of damaged neurons. White blood cells were genetically altered to create glial cell-derived neurotropic factor (GDNF). GDNF is related to the growth of nervous tissue and has been found to promote the healing of damaged neurons. Studies have also shown that GDNF may be able to combat the progression Parkinson’s disease, a disorder that causes complications in bodily coordination and movement. Currently, no treatments exist to stop or reverse Parkinson’s disease.  
By using white blood cells, the treatment evades the body’s natural immune response, allowing the cells to travel into the brain and deliver the protective proteins. In the near future, the scientists predict that their research will be incorporated into clinical practice. Details of their findings can be found in an online publication on PLOS ONE.

Recent clinical trial suggests new blood pressure standard
According to a recent press release from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) in Bethesda, Maryland, scientists have found that further reducing patient’s systolic blood pressure, the pressure from the contraction of the heart, under the currently recommended guideline may decrease the incidents of heart attack, stroke and death. In a study that started in 2009, one group received drugs that lowered blood pressure to 140 millimeters of mercury, while another group received drugs that lowered blood pressure to 120 millimeters of mercury.
Results showed that participants in the lower blood pressure group, when compared to the higher blood pressure group, were a third less likely to experience heart attacks and strokes. They also were nearly a quarter less likely to die. These statistics challenge clinical guidelines that healthy adults should have a blood pressure of less than 140 millimeters of mercury.
In the coming months, the NHLBI scientists will be working on publishing the results of their study.

Killer Bees located in California are now migrating north
Since their arrival in California in 1994, Africanized honeybees have migrated as far north as the state’s delta region, as reported by researchers from the University of California, San Diego. During the 1950s, imported African bees mated with local populations of European honey bees, incorporating African genes that have promoted the survival of the hybrid offspring. Africanized bees have been found to possess advantages over non-Africanized bees, including better resistance to disease and parasites.
First introduced in Texas, the Africanized bees have spread to many of the warm coastal regions in the United States. With the advent of higher temperatures from global warming, scientists predict that the bees will gradually move further north. Their highly aggressive nature, which gave them the name “killer” bees, has caused concerns about the further migration of the Africanized bees. On the other hand, the advantageous traits of the Africanized bees have the potential to solve the issue of the diminishing honey bee population that is posing a threat to food production.

Study says burning all fossil fuels will melt all of Antarctica
A group of German, American and British scientists have found that burning all the world’s fossil fuels would lead to the complete melting of the Antarctic ice-sheet, resulting in ocean water raising 50 meters in height. In their research, which is now published in the journal Science Advances, the scientists used computer models to account for environmental conditions, including warming air and ocean temperatures. They were able to conclude that there are enough fossil fuels to melt all of Antarctica. If all of this was burned, land that is inhabited by a billion people could someday disappear under water.
The scientists also investigated the effect of restricting the increase in global warming to a two degrees celcius increase, which is the goal currently being aimed for by many nations. In this scenario, countries would have time to adjust to the rising tide, which would then only increase by a few meters in the next thousand years. However, if all the fossil fuels are burned, sea levels could rise up to 30 centimeters within a mere decade.

Latest models of Apple’s iPhone are released to public
Apple has unveiled its latest models of the iPhone, including the iPhone 6S as well as the iPhone 6S Plus. While the size and shape of the iPhones have stayed the same, the newer models are slightly heavier in weight compared to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The new phones also include sturdier glass and aluminum to prevent them from bending. Improvements in hardware were prioritized over the development of design, resulting in the improvement of processing power in the updated models.
One of the novel features of the upgrade is Apple’s 3D touch, which opens up menus of different options by recognizing two different pressures of touch. For example, when a user opens an image, a lighter touch can display a preview of the image, while a heavier touch displays the image on a fullscreen. Other new features include a 12-megapixel camera, and a rose gold colored iPhone. During the past weekend, Apple has allowed the public to preorder the new phones.

This year’s Video Music Awards were an overwhelmingly political event. From the get-go, various choices that the producers made this year were questionable or ill advised. Miley Cyrus as the host was one of the choices I did not agree with. She has never hosted a single awards show, nor does she have much experience with live television in front of such a large audience. Miley has also been known for her “interesting” choices. She unabashedly says and does things that are not well received in terms of tone, audience, or delivery.
When nominations were revealed, the VMAs were already causing controversy within the political realm by snubbing Nicki Minaj’s “Anaconda” video as a Video of the Year nominee. Minaj speculated via Twitter that if the video featured extremely thin women, then it would have most likely been nominated for the award. This prompted the only female nominated for Video of the Year (Taylor Swift for “Bad Blood”) to tweet back that maybe one of her spots was taken by one of the men. Swift made the argument about herself, rather than understanding that this is more about a system of racial inequality.
The misunderstanding — or as most media called it, feud — between the artists was cleared up once Taylor talked to Nicki and understood that the tweet wasn’t a deliberate stab at her. The media’s portrayal of this brief rift made it seem much worse than what it was, and news outlets were constantly flashing imagery that only furthered racial stereotypes and the idea of the “angry black woman” and making the white girl a victim. Reporters tended to use pictures of Nicki Minaj making faces, but pictures of Taylor in nice dresses. While these actions might not have been intentional, they clearly show a lack of racial consciousness and truly showcase the systemic aspect of racism in America.
On the night of the performance, Taylor Swift was able to redeem herself and show that she was not truly fighting with Nicki Minaj by making an appearance in Minaj’s opening number during the night. They poked fun at each other by closing that opening set with Swift’s “Bad Blood.” Later on, she was able to tell everyone that she’s over everything that has happened to her on the VMA stages by introducing Kanye West for his Video Vanguard Award. As almost everyone remembers, Kanye went on stage and said that Taylor did not deserve her award and that Beyonce should have won for her “Single Ladies” video a few years ago.
During Kanye’s 11-minute speech, he apologized for being disrespectful to certain artists in the past, because he’s always been pushing for the art. He went on to say that award shows are by definition awful for an artist’s mentality because they pit artists against each other rather than showing that all of them belong to the art. They decide which one is better when there is no such thing. He then went on to say the following powerful words: “I’m confident. I believe in myself. We the millennials, bro. This is a new mentality. We’re not gonna control our kids with brands. We not gonna teach low self-esteem and hate to our kids. We gonna teach our kids that they can be something. We gonna teach our kids that they can stand up for theyself! We gonna teach our kids to believe in themselves!” And he finished off his speech with something that has left the world speechless, and the media crying “rant”: Kanye West has decided to run in the 2020 American Presidential elections.

The first floor of the Miller Gallery looks more like a 19th-century science experiment than an art piece, and that’s why it serves as a perfect introduction to the gallery’s current exhibit “Aftersound: Frequency, Attack, Return.” “Helmholtz (DUO),” an installation piece by Stanford-based artist Paul De Marinis, is a demonstration of Helmholtz resonators. Candle flames are placed alongside large glass spheres that act as resonators for a low-frequency sound that can be heard thumping like a heartbeat in the darkened space. A spinning mirror behind the flame allows the viewer to see the flame dance and respond to the soundwaves. It sounds simple, but the space creates a certain sense of delicacy in watching a small flame tremble from a barely audible thud.
The concept of the aftersound is similar to that of the afterimage, in that one can continue to “hear” a sound after it is no longer being played. The exhibit is curated by School of Art Associate Professor Melissa Ragona and Margaret Cox and features work from artists across the country and the world. All of the pieces explore the nature of sound across mediums, such as combining sound with a visual medium, transforming it across mediums, or manipulating it through technological hardware. Many of the pieces are interactive, giving “Aftersound” visitors a more dynamic experience than a traditional gallery exhibition.
Each floor of the exhibit has its own distinct feel and aesthetic. The third floor explores sound along with both static and moving visuals, in which many pieces explore the transformation of sound waves into visual mediums. The second floor, on the other hand, resembles something like Steve Wozniak’s garage. Large, messy-looking technological installations explore the transformation and manipulation of sound using magnets and wires.
On the second floor, “IR Chorus,” by Pittsburgh-based artist and School of Music Assistant Professor Jesse Stiles displays candles placed around the perimeter edge of a table. Infrared sensors are positioned above the candles, converting the flickering flame to a varying voltage which in turn modulates a set of individually tuned digital oscillators. This creates a low electrical buzzing that can be heard coming through a speaker — an actual sound that is created by the flickering of the flame. This is an example of how “Aftersound” explores the transformation of sound across mediums.
The third floor has many pieces that explore the visual nature of sound. “Quotidian Review” by New York-based artist Matt Wellins is an interactive software piece that links sounds taken from the sound effects library of animation studio Hanna-Barbera, to psychedelic visual representations of mundane objects such as Coke bottles and briefcases freely floating in the digital space. Using a mouse, visitors can move the objects around and crash them into each other, generating the cartoon sound effects.
Curator Melissa Ragona shared her motivations over email for choosing sound as the theme for this fall’s Miller Gallery exhibit.
“For many years, I have studied the critical impact sound — as a medium — has had across the arts, i.e. in particular, I have explored the use of sound in experimental film, and more recently, how sound plays a role in contemporary art. I also teach a course entitled ‘NOISE: Toward a Critical Theory of Sound and Hearing’ in which I encourage students to deconstruct the ‘hegemony of vision,’ the deeply seated visual bias dominating Western thought and culture since the ancient Greeks. I am currently teaching NOISE within the School of Art and, together, we are attempting to construct a ‘critical theory of sound,’ foregrounding the ways in which we hear (casual, concentrated, distracted) as well as the contexts in which listening takes place, i.e. the social and historical conditions of reception that give meaning to what is heard. Many of the artists in our exhibition have often been featured prominently in my class readings and playlists, such as Maryanne Amacher, John Cage, Paul DeMarinis, Marina Rosenfeld, Cathy Berberian, György Ligeti, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Iannis Xenakis. So, I’ve been wanting to curate an exhibition on sound for the Miller Gallery for quite some time now — to expand both my teaching and my own research.”
“Aftersound” will run in the Miller Gallery until Nov. 22. On Sept. 25 there will be an official opening reception from 6 to 8 p.m., which is free and open to the public and will see some of the artists in attendance discussing their work.

This summer I found myself in a couple-week slump during which I was listening to a lot of Lana Del Rey. One of the best things about Lana Del Rey is that she can always be counted on to sound sad. Even Del Rey’s songs that are arguably semi-optimistic in content sound very sad, so you can always tune out the lyrics and just focus on how unhappy the melody makes your soul feel and wallow in self-pity for an hour or two. If you find yourself listening to too much Lana Del Rey, it is always advisable to stand up, shake it off, and listen to “Lollipop” by Mika on repeat until you feel perkier. For those of us who see the positives of her permeating misery and long for the day when we can explore new facets of Lana Del Rey, we do not have long to wait. Lana Del Rey’s fourth studio album Honeymoon is set to be released this upcoming Friday, Sept. 18.
Four singles from the 14-track album have already been released. The single “Honeymoon” was released in mid-July to general appreciation, with a leading melodic string line characteristic of Del Rey’s earlier music. Contrary to some of these earlier numbers, the string line is sweeter and gentler, and there is less of her frequently-used, tortured-sounding synth line beneath it. Have no fear however: The song still has a wistful and melancholic tenor. It opens with the lyrics, “We both know it’s not fashionable to love me,” which is completely in accord with the self-deprecating, insecure, and romantic nature of Del Rey’s music.
The other pre-released singles from the album include the lead single “High By the Beach,” and promotional singles “Terrence Loves You” and “Music to Watch Boys To,” which were released progressively through the summer, the latter promotional single only a few days ago.
Del Rey is also notable for her combination of throaty, almost deadpan singing in her lower register and passionate falsetto melodic lines. If I had to determine the biggest difference in the songs so far released from Honeymoon, I would have to say that there seems to be more singing in Lana’s upper register, giving her songs a bit of a lighter feel. In general, while nuanced and often disciplined, Del Rey’s voice sounds a little less controlled and a little less produced in these singles. While there is still reverb on her voice, and they do not sound like acoustic songs at all, Del Rey seems to have taken a small departure from the extent of production on past songs. But believe me when I say that, given these songs, the sound and subject matter of Del Rey’s music has not changed much since 2014’s Ultraviolence. But that’s totally fine — Del Rey has a sound, and it’s working for her.
In addition to releasing her singles on YouTube, Spotify, and iTunes, Del Rey has released a music video for “High By the Beach” and has also released a small preview music video that features short musical clips of all the songs on the album. Revealed perhaps most obviously in Del Rey’s short film “Tropico” is her passion for sensual allure grounded in historical events. A creature of the past, Del Rey’s music often reflects common themes from history or religion. In “Tropico,” the story of Adam and Eve was a central theme. In her song “National Anthem,” Del Rey interpreted the lifestyle of a woman married to a politician in a weird re-enactment of President John F. Kennedy, with music video blending midcentury glamour and modern popular culture. In “High By the Beach,” Lana Del Rey wanders around a large and sparsely decorated beach house as a chopper floats outside the window with what looks like a paparazzo photographer trying to get a photo of her through the window. Del Rey frantically runs through the house, and the video culminates with her taking a large gun out of a guitar case and shooting down the chopper, desperately trying to live quietly and away from the limelight. The set and wardrobe in the video are simple with Del Rey’s face serene and placid to match. The video definitely continues the pattern of Del Rey’s effortless sensuality and drama.
Lana Del Rey’s life is intriguing to many, and most recently actor James Franco has come forward to announce that he is cowriting a book about Del Rey, a personal friend of his. In a Rolling Stone article about the upcoming book, Franco quoted Del Rey as saying, “Just write around me; it’s better if it’s not my own words. It’s almost better if you don’t get me exactly, but try.” This quote is so quintessentially Lana Del Rey, and is reflected in her music. It is never quite clear if her songs and videos about love, temptation, celebrity, emotional upheavals, are about her own life experiences and desires, or if they are entirely a construct of the persona she wants to portray. Her music reveals personal demons but also evokes a sense of mystery and secretiveness. It is this emotional depth and complicated meaning that keeps us all coming back to Lana Del Rey for more of her soft yet desperate vocal timbre and dramatic story arcs.
While this album may not demonstrate an incredible level of artistic growth for Del Rey, the album, which is produced by Del Rey herself, might just in fact give listeners the most authentic portrayal of Del Rey’s artistic vision to date. Most importantly, the album still seems like an excellent option for a rainy, stressful day of homework and afternoons pondering the complications of messy relationships. This excellent emotional fodder will be available to the masses Friday, when Honeymoon is released.

I don’t think I understood how a city could have a pace until I came to D.C.. There are millions of moving parts, and I feel like I’m constantly trying to catch up with them. The people I pass on the street seem so much more put together than I am, and not just because their business attire is magically intact when riding the metro in 90 degree heat. They’re smarter, more interesting, and more in control of their lives.
I’ve had office jobs before. I’ve had internships before. And yet my internship here is unlike anything I’ve ever done, because the work never actually stops. The office is constantly inundated with new information, and I’m only handling a tiny part of it. I’ll get more secure in the work over the course of the semester, but I don’t know if I’ll ever have the aura of confidence that radiates from my fellow metro riders. I have a few months to get a stronger feel for the city. I’ll come to understand the pace a little better with time.
Carnegie Mellon stress culture takes a different form here. Work-life balance in Pittsburgh revolves around campus events and social groups. Here, there is an overwhelming number of intellectual and cultural events every day, and I can never quite attend enough. I’m constantly impressed.
I went to a hearing and a briefing on the hill with interns from my office, which were both intimidating and incredibly official. The hearing discussed campus sexual assault policy, which felt important and relevant for all college students. I kept referring back to my Survivor Support Network (SSN) training. Then we sat in on the briefing about the Rethink Discipline initiative, which addressed the issue of disproportionate punishment for minority students and students with disabilities. It felt like an important issue that wasn’t getting enough attention, and yet people had devoted time and resources to it. Both events were full of people who cared about the issues and had done their research. I started to feel like experts were everywhere.
Politicians actively campaign against “Washington insiders” with every election cycle, characterizing their opponents as clueless or power-hungry. It’s easy to make fun of misguided legislation on healthcare made by non-doctors or on technology made by the tech-illiterate, but the truth is that policymakers make policy. They can’t have a background in medicine and agriculture and education — it’s the unelected people working in Washington who are advising, promoting, and crafting those policies. I met a former engineer who now serves on the professional staff for the House Armed Services Committee, specializing in nuclear weapons. Employees at federal agencies are doing the statistical analysis to support marginalized populations. These people are smart and invested in what they do, contrary to public opinion about D.C..
I’ve had so many new experiences since arriving here. They range from high-profile to small-scale, but they’ve all made me consider my own place in the city. On my lunch break last week, I walked to the lawn of the Capitol to hear Donald Trump and Ted Cruz refute the Iran Nuclear Deal. I’ve spent time in Smithsonians and got a library card from the Library of Congress. This weekend I saw a purportedly-feminist play that did a great job talking about body image and shame, even though the narrative revolved around a man. I’ve also been to discussions and debates ranging from charter schools to the Iran deal. Each of these made me think critically and carefully, in a way that I’m not used to beyond the academic bubble.
It’s exhausting.
Understanding the pace of the city reaffirms the feeling that I won’t be able to catch up, but it’s still exciting to be here.

Campus is back into the swing of things, and the sheen of being back is just starting to wear off. Joyous campus reunions are being replaced by the typical late night of Carnegie Mellon homework, and you’re probably starting to remember (or just now learning) your favorite ways to pass time and put off the work.
Don’t fret though! A new school year also means a new lineup of television shows, and we’ve got the scoop on this year’s newbies and returning favorites — plus a couple of nostalgic throwbacks.
The Mindy Project — Sept. 15, Hulu
The former FOX comedy makes its Hulu debut on Tuesday. Episodes will still be released on a weekly schedule, but without the limitations of a time slot Mindy may just have the freedom she needs to flourish. This season: Dr. Mindy Lahiri tackles pregnancy and commitment with Dr. Daniel Castellano, but everyone knows OBGYNs make the worst patients.
Scream Queens — Sept. 22, FOX
The latest Ryan Murphy creation is a parody of classic ‘80s horror films. Focusing on a series of murders involving a sorority, this newest Murphy brainchild is sure to be filled with delightfully horrible situations, punctuated by an all-star cast: Lea Michele, Emma Roberts, Keke Palmer, Abigail Breslin, and Jamie Lee Curtis to name a few members. The already released opening credits point toward the sort of tongue-in-cheek, genre focus Murphy has become known for — but don’t expect him to go easy on the gore.
Heroes Reborn — Sept. 24, NBC
In case you haven’t noticed, it is the era of reboots. While you are no doubt waiting with bated breath for Fuller House to hit Netflix, for now you’ll have to do with this 13-episode continuation of the hit 2006 series. Some original cast members are returning, but this new series focuses on Luke (Zachary Levi) as he searches for revenge after suffering a loss. While it doesn’t look like there’s a cheerleader to save this time around, there is a whole host of new characters, many with gifts that make them more than human.
Quantico — Sept. 27, ABC
Another year, another procedural drama with a twist. This time it’s Quantico, which focuses on the newest class of trainees at the FBI’s Quantico base. They’re super smart, super beautiful, and one of them is planning a massive terrorist attack. Expect a case-of-the-week structure with the added drama of national security. The creator, Joshua Safran, also executive produced Gossip Girl and Smash, so you should also expect some soapy romance and/or illicit relationships.
Madam Secretary — Oct. 4, CBS 
Among the many dysfunctional television relationships, there was one shining start last year: the stable and loving marriage between Secretary of State Elizabeth (Téa Leoni) and Dr. Henry McCord (Tim Daly). As beautiful as the marriage is, the show is even better. National security may be on the line, but somehow we still want to know more about the goings-on of the McCord household. This season: Madeleine Albright guest stars and Patina Miller (CFA ’06) continues to make us proud.
American Horror Story: Hotel — Oct. 7, FX
Ryan Murphy’s other current show almost doesn’t need an introduction. This season of the horror anthology focuses on the Hotel Cortez and a series of murders that may be connected with it. Although Jessica Lange will sadly not be a part of this season, many other cast members are returning, including Matt Bomer (CFA ’00). Lady Gaga joins the cast as owner of the Hotel Cortez. Viewers have also been promised connections with past seasons, especially the first (including an appearance by the murder house).
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend — Oct. 12, The CW
The trend that Glee started is still happening. Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is a musical-comedy series about Rebecca (Rachel Bloom) who moves across the country in pursuit of a boy who dumped her in high school. Don’t expect it to be life-changing, but don’t be surprised if it turns out to be pretty good. Things to watch for: random singing, a slight but significant character shift for Rebecca, and a love triangle. It is the CW, after all.
Jane the Virgin — Oct. 12, The CW
Speaking of the CW, Jane the Virgin completely blew television away last season. An adaptation of a telenovela, Jane depicts a young woman (Golden Globe winner Gina Rodriguez) who is accidentally artificially inseminated. A crazy premise that only becomes more complicated, this show has the type of soul you don’t see much on television, and especially not on the CW. This season we pick up after Jane’s newborn son is kidnapped by the crime lord Sin Rostro. Watch for the heart, but get sucked in by the story.
Supergirl — Oct. 26, CBS
In the midst of the current superhero overload, the idea of a show focused on Supergirl may not seem overly exciting. But don’t rule this one out yet. From the looks of previews, CBS’ Supergirl is looking to be a simpler, more hero-focused show than others out there. Don’t expect crazy interweaving plotlines. Instead, the heart of this show seems to be in the idea of a hero itself. Melissa Benoist, of former Glee fame, stars as the titular heroine, and seems to have just the right amount of sugary sweetness to make her cover story believable.
For those nights you wish you were still a kid, Reading Rainbow and Mr. Rogers Neghborhood now have episodes available on Netflix. We won’t judge you for watching if you don’t judge us. Plus, you might learn something.

As much as I’d like to believe I’m a cultured intellectual, mindless entertainment might just be my greatest weakness.
You know the drill. You’ve spent all week working your butt off, and Friday finally comes. The work hasn’t ended (does it ever?), but you have ten minutes or so to breathe. You’ve earned it. A movie is way too much commitment, and even an hour seems long to focus on one episode of a show. But 20 minutes of Friends? A YouTube video or two? That sounds perfect, right?
Wrong. That’s how they trap you. Next thing you know, you’re sitting pants-less in the dark covered in Tostitos crumbs, and you’ve literally run out of BuzzFeed videos to watch. You can actually feel brain soup leaking out of your ears. You’re distantly aware that you have class tomorrow, but the panic has been mostly drowned out by that dazed, icky, self-loathing feeling. You’ve transcended to a new plane of procrastination.
What is so darn addictive about #RELATABLE sketches, cats being cute, and strangers performing outlandish challenges? Well, I’ve decided to punish myself for this weekend by puzzling it out.
There’s a science to our stupid crap binges. For starters, length is key. The perfect YouTube video spans four to six minutes. It needs to be short enough to hold your probably short and divided attention. At the same time, it must be long enough that the process of clicking and loading and buffering feels worth it, and you don’t become aware that you have tumbled into a chain-clicking spiral. As you click, you must always be thinking: “Just one more, one more couldn’t hurt.”
Close cousins with length is cohesion. A quality editing job is half the battle won against your wrecked productivity. Editing cuts out any boring lag-time or unrelated tangents, so your attention doesn’t have a moment to waver. Through the entirety of the video, you should be laughing, “aww”-ing, about to laugh, or engaging in limited self-reflection (i.e. “Why don’t I have a cat?”; “Maybe I could pull off a faux hawk”; “How hard can it be to sneak a cat into my dorm?”). Editing turns a video into a bite-sized dopamine blast. Much like Tostitos, you can never have just one.
Now that we have the form locked down, let’s take a look at content. A video (at least one that doesn’t feature small, fluffy creatures) should satisfy at least one of two natural human compulsions: finding people who are “Just Like You” and gawking at those who are definitely not. I call this the relatable-voyeuristic spectrum, where the vast majority of popular videos find a home. 
BuzzFeed has the spectrum down to a fine art. With the sheer scope and volume of its content, you can try on identities like hats. Right now, a playlist of “tall/gay/Asian/awkward problems” is out there waiting for you. It won’t be long until your relate-ability standards dwindle. You’ll start clicking on things like “11 Startling Boob Confessions” because, hey — you have those.
Voyeurism is also a tempting beast. People like to watch other people do things that they can’t, don’t, won’t or shouldn’t do. While you probably wouldn’t want to go anywhere near surströmming (“The Stinkiest Food in the World”), people’s faces are pretty freaking rich when they get a whiff. And while no one will likely ever let you on the Wipeout set, it’s a hell of a lot of fun watching equally unfit people give it a try. Maybe you’d love to have a professional makeup artist transform you into Lady Gaga, but most of us just don’t have those kind of resources. Watching it online is the next best thing.
Addictive videos allow you to live vicariously through other people, and personality is critical. Sure, you’re alone in your room, not with any actual friends. But keep watching and the strangers in these videos will start to feel like friends. Vloggers get popular by inviting strangers to peer into a window at their usually glamorous, fun, and interesting lives. Even mass-produced, common-denominator BuzzFeed lures in viewers with characters like “The Try Guys.” You’ll start thinking “oh, that guy’s got cool hair, he’s pretty funny” and end up thinking you might as well watch every video he’s ever been in.
Basically, trash entertainment is the slipperiest of slopes. There’s a fine line between a guilty pleasure and an actually self-destructive habit. I’m still walking the tightrope. I hope your balance is better than mine.

This might be my favorite season for movies and, fortunately, it lasts about three months. The time when acclaimed directors submit their next projects to selection committees and world premieres of the next wave of Oscar contenders get their time in the sun. While films that dominate the Sundance Film Festival in January get their summer releases, the Toronto International Film Festival and the New York Film Festival have become the main stage for films holding a fall release, and those that get serious Oscar buzz come award season. Here’s a look at some smaller titles that may not be on your radar but have the right pieces in place to make a great night at the theater.
Beasts of No Nation
Cary Fukunaga (Jane Eyre, True Detective) writes and directs this war drama set in present-day West Africa. Starring Idris Alba as “Commandant”, a military general, this film actually focuses on Agu, a child who is forced to join a group of mercenaries after civil war tears his family apart.
Idris Elba has taken on a variety of roles that range all over the spectrum. That wouldn’t be special, except for the fact that he always kills it — every time. From the action-thriller No Good Deed, to the thrilling action of Pacific Rim, Elba brings his insane talent to every character he portrays. There’s no doubt he brings it again in Beasts of No Nation. Look for this one on Netflix and independent theaters starting Oct. 16.
Black Mass
The last time director Scott Cooper was in charge, we got Out of the Furnace; a gritty and well-acted film starring Christian Bale and Casey Affleck. Now he’s bringing us Black Mass, starring Johnny Depp as infamous Boston-based mobster James “Whitey” Bulger. Taking place during the late 1970s, while Bulger acted as an informant for the FBI, Black Mass is shaping up to give Johnny Depp an opportunity to remind us why he is one of the best. Black Mass gets its theatrical release on Sept. 18.
Room
There is no hesitation in saying Brie Larson will eventually become “Academy Award Winner” Brie Larson. She has an outstanding, unsung talent to be the most authentic person on screen, and Room has the premise to convey that message loud and clear. “What if, when we were born, we were mature enough to be in awe of the world around us? To be stricken by its beauty? And what if we were able to experience it with the person we love most?” Larson plays Ma, a mother who, along with her 5-year-old son Jack (played by Jacob Tremblay), has been locked inside a shed, known as “Room”, for the last half-decade. Jack has only ever seen the inside of “Room”, and Ma must teach him about the world outside of it. The trailer is chillingly beautiful and I anticipate great performances from both Larson and Tremblay. Room hits limited theaters on Oct. 16, to be expanded nationwide on Nov. 6.
Sicario
Director Denis Villeneuve isn’t necessarily a household name, but movies such as Enemy and Prisoners immediately make my ears perk up. Now I hear he’s got Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro, and Josh Brolin in his next film centered around the Mexican-American border. Blunt plays Kate Macer, an FBI agent tasked with preventing escalation of the war against drugs. Early showings at the Cannes and Toronto Film Festivals have started a hurricane of good-graces for all players involved. Mark your calendars for a limited release on Sept. 18 with a national expansion on Oct. 2.
These four films will certainly get the blood flowing. In case these don’t tickle your fancy, be sure to look into other interesting titles such as Trumbo, 99 Homes (Andrew Garfield, Michael Shannon), Mississippi Grind (Ryan Reynolds, Ben Mendolsohn), I Saw The Light (Tom Hiddleston, Elizabeth Olsen) and Spotlight (Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton).

Once again the British have come. Once again they were great.
For those who don’t know, every year for the past 6 years or so — according to director/writer Hunter Allen — Scotch’n’Soda Theatre has hosted the illustrious Cambridge Footlights. The Footlights, a sketch comedy troupe from Cambridge University, start afresh each year with an entirely new cast and crew, as they have been doing since 1883. Past members include Peter Cooke, Eric Idle, Hugh Laurie, John Oliver, and many other famous funny Brits. Point is, they’re pretty cool.
This years show, “Love Handles,” had everything, from poop jokes to cowboys in love to some gossipy grapes. I attended the 10 p.m. show in McConomy Auditorium on Friday night, which was the second of two shows they performed that evening. While McConomy was not totally full, the show was a great experience for everyone involved. The actors played their parts well, and it was clear to the audience that they knew what they were doing. They moved together and performed as a cohesive unit.
Toward the beginning of the show they did a sketch in which one character had received another’s arms in a transplant, but all control remained in the original owner. One character moved their arms in relation to the other’s storyline. This scene only worked because of the intense connection the actors clearly had. It was rehearsed well and made to look thoroughly convincing.
From this they moved to a musical number centered around the forbidden but burning love between the outlaw and the sheriff, riffing off of the Brokeback Mountain trope we all know so well. This number, and subsequent musical numbers, shared the same sense of humor and wordplay utilized by Jermaine Clement and Bret McKenzie of HBO’s Flight of the Conchords. For those who like that kind of humor, which plays off of preconceived notions, hidden emotions, and whimsical wordplay, this would have done it. I’m pretty sure I cackled at the line, “I’m not into necrophilia, I just want to necro-feel your ass,” which was, arguably, the best line in the entire show.
In a later scene, the two men, Luke Summer and Archie Henderson-Cleland, are linked together gossiping away. It is revealed that the two are grapes hanging on the vine talking trash and collecting/telling secrets about their neighboring grapes. While this scene in and of itself was funny and had the audience laughing away, the most impressive part came at the end. The two leaned into an audience member and asked for a secret. When they hopped back up, they told the audience the secret. What was impressive, however, was that instead of simply repeating what the audience member had said or stating something previously scripted they improvised a secret in almost perfect unison. Now, anyone who has watched Saturday Night Live has seen two people try to simultaneously improvise a unison line — Kristen Wiig and Fred Armisen did it as Kath and Garth all the time — but what you may not have seen is it being done successfully. While Armisen and Wiig manage to entertain, it typically becomes a situation in which one of them comes up with the phrase and the other masterfully reads the direction of speech to create unison. Summer and Henderson-Cleland, however, actually managed to mentally tie in and appeared to create the line together in the moment, making it that much more entertaining.
Each actor was great at what they did. Summers has a great talent for accent, Henderson-Cleland moves like a praying mantis and matches Summers’ accent talent almost completely, Eleanor Colville fully committed to each moment utilizing body and speech beautifully, and Olivia Le Anderson has incredible control over her body. I later found out that she in fact studied ballet for many years, and thus her physicality is less surprising and still incredibly funny and impressive.
Ultimately it was clear that the Cambridge Footlights was a unit. These people have worked together for months at this point and have really learned how to play off of both each other and the audience. According to some members of cast and crew, the audience in each place is quite different. I’m sure some members of our campus community would be glad to know that we are the most heckle-y audience they’ve had so far. Well done.
In one of the final scenes Summers, as an Australian chiropractor, plucks a volunteer from the audience to whom he offers an adjustment. At the 10 p.m. show I attended, the man they chose did about as much as he could to make sure he was funny. He was, by the way, but what made it great is that every time the audience member laid down incorrectly, or later straddled Summers in a new and different way, Summer played it off beautifully. He never broke character, he never got frustrated with the scene, he never even tried to speed the audience member along. He simply played further into it. His conviction and dedication to the scene and the space was expert, and made the event seem much more welcoming and open than many shows I have seen in the past. The fourth wall wasn’t broken because the fourth wall was never really there.
The entire night was a conversation between the audience and The Footlights, and we loved every minute of it. Every joke may not have landed, but every scene was funny and we spent the majority of the show laughing away. The man behind me giggled through the whole thing. I love having the Cambridge Footlights here every year, and every year they manage to exceed expectations. I sincerely hope they continue to stop in the years to come, and for those who missed this year don’t worry, they’ll be back in a mere 12 months.

Hi, Josh
I’ve just entered into a new relationship, and I really need some advice. Before Joscelyn, I had a really strict routine. I used to wake up at 4:00 a.m., go on a run, lift, do my beauty routine, make breakfast, and do any work that spilled over from the previous day.
Now, though, I wake up around 8:00 a.m. when she wakes up, and we hardly have enough time for eat breakfast because we both have 9:00 a.m. classes. I love her already, and I really love spending time with her, but I fear that by forgoing my established routine, I’m not being my best self. I miss gently exfoliating and moisturizing in the morning after a tough workout. I fear that my girlfriend’s presence is making me ugly and weak.
Sincerely,
Undergoing Gross Lessening of Youth
Dear UGLY,
The honeymoon phase can often be an upset to one’s daily routine. It’s a change, a time of transition, allowing someone else to share your life. My advice is not to stress out about it. In time, maybe a week or two, you can get back to your routine and possibly bring Joscelyn along, or even adapt your routine to include her. Either way, you are going to be able to work out and beautify again, don’t worry. While we do often feel weak, significant others are there to give us strength when we need it most.
Cheers,
Joshua Brown.

The hilarious story of a man and his teddy bear companion returned this summer with a sequel. It opens with John (Mark Wahlberg) recently divorced from Lori (unfortunately no Mila Kunis in this one), while Ted (Seth McFarlane) has married his girlfriend Tami-Lynn. With the marriage growing stale, they decide to adopt. The process then leads the State to determine that he is legally property, not a person. As a result, his marriage to Tami-Lynn is annulled and he loses his job. John suggests that they take his case to court, and they receive a pro-bono lawyer named Samantha (Amanda Seyfried). The rest of the movie follows the legal struggle to restore Ted’s personhood, while John and Samantha obviously fall in love.

Driving past Bakery square on the way to Target, Carnegie Mellon Students can spot a new construction on Penn avenue. With Google’s Bakery Square campus flanking either side now, it is hard to not notice the growth that Pittburgh is experiencing. Carnegie Mellon has long been a home to some of the brightest minds in computer science, so it should not come as a surprise that a corporation which prides itself in hiring the best and the brightest situates itself so close to a campus with this reputation.
Google began its work in Pittsburgh in 2006 with a mere two engineers, according to its website. After five years, the Fortune 500 company grew to the point where the move to its current location was the most logical decision. Now with an office population greater “than the number of Spartans at Thermopylae,” or in other words, 300, expansion seems the logical step for developers in the area.
That is exactly the opportunity the company Walnut Capital has invested in. Self-described on its website as “one of Pittsburgh’s largest and fastest growing real estate management, development and brokerage companies,” Walnut Capital further bolsters its growth with the Bakery Square expansion currently under way.
Situated on Walnut street — a cultural and commercial bastion of Shadyside — Walnut Capital finds itself near flourishing companies like Duolingo, and those that are well established and internationally recognizable, like Rolex. With this cultural position, it is not surprising that Walnut Capital would invest in diversifying an area by a company that prides itself in diversity: Google.
Diversity is exactly what Bakery Square has. Walnut Capital’s own website lists the demographics of Bakery Square and its surrounding areas: just under 338,000 residents live within a five mile radius of Google’s Bakery Square location. Bakery Square is a predominantly commercial real estate location, and for potential buyers, the client base is large. In 2010, “Over $131,700,000.00 [were] spent on dining out & over $138,059,381.00 [were] spent on apparel service purchases in the neighboring communities,” according to Walnut Capital’s website.
Looking around the area, it should be clear that it is undergoing gentrification. With popular student restaurant destinations such as Noodlehead just up the street and consumer locations like Home Depot and Target on its peripheries, Bakery Square stands as an icon to Pittsburgh’s technological growth. According to Walnut Capital’s statistics, “14.2 percent of Households [in the area] have a net worth of over $500,000.00,” and over 250,000 employees work within five miles of the site. Google acknowledges its reasoning for moving to the Bakery Square location in its online description of the Pittsburgh offices. The webpage says, “We have an especially deep relationship with Carnegie Mellon (CMU), co-hosting seminars with the university, running shuttle buses to CMU for Googlers teaching or participating in events on campus and hosting CMU students in our office a couple of times a month.”
With an expansion of the already large campus — housed in an old Nabisco factory, and including a Kennywood roller coaster replica — Google and Carnegie Mellon can expect to positively develop their symbiotic intellectual relationship. Carnegie Mellon has continued to become more relevant in the modern technological age, and the school’s name can be heard on the radio and seen on the news nearly weekly. With Google’s campus so close, both the school and the company will benefit from each other’s intellectual nourishment and ability to recruit pure talent.

Title IX, a section of the 1972 Education Amendments, mandates that all educational institutions receiving federal funds treat male and female students equally. Although Title IX covers all aspects of higher education — everything from coursework to athletics — the national focus has recently shifted to Title IX in the context of sexual assault and relationship violence.
To that end, Carnegie Mellon recently established the Office of Title IX Initiatives. The goal of the Office of Title IX Initiatives, according to part-time Interim Director of the office and Title IX Coordinator Holly Hippensteel, is “gender equity broadly defined.”
As part-time interim director, Hippensteel hopes to “really launch the office [and] make it a resource that people are aware of around campus,” she told The Tartan. “We want to take a look at some existing structures that are currently there — how do we want to tweak those; how do we want to centralize that?”
The newly formed Office has a space in West Wing 102, where Hippensteel sits with alumna Jamie Edwards (DC ’07), assistant director of Title IX initiatives. Edwards graduated from Carnegie Mellon with a bachelor’s degree in political science and history & public policy, and previously practiced law related to domestic violence and abuse in Pittsburgh and New Jersey.
The search is currently underway for a full-time director of the new office; although the university has not yet established a timeline for the search, Hippensteel will hold the position part-time for a year. Hippensteel also works under the Department of Student Affairs as a housefellow and assistant dean of Student Affairs.
The Office of Title IX Initiatives is part of an ongoing fight against sexual assault and relationship violence on campus, spurred by a lawsuit brought against the university by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in December 2013 and the subsequent investigation of the university by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR).
Last semester, the OCR held a series of roundtables on Carnegie Mellon’s campus as part of the investigation. After the OCR’s roundtables, the Office of Student Affairs held its own series of roundtable discussions, arranged by Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno. The roundtables, targeted toward varied demographic groups in the university community, asked students how the university can best educate students and the surrounding community on the issues of sexual assault and relationship violence.
The university is also in the process of updating its Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault, and looking at the results of last semester’s survey on sexual assault and relationship violence. The results of the survey, Casalegno wrote in an email to the student body, will be available later this fall.
The Office of Title IX Initiatives is in charge of much of the sexual assault and relationship violence prevention training on campus — including that given to resident assistants — community assistants, and members of Orientation staff. The Office is working closely with Coordinator of Gender Programs and Sexual Violence Prevention Jess Klein, the Survivor Support Network (SSN), and student groups such as Got Consent? and Student Senate to increase outreach to and coordinate education for the university community about sexual assault and relationship violence prevention.
“We have all these functions and roles, like prevention, education, support, and response,” Hippensteel said, “But there wasn’t a central office that was really coordinating or facilitating the effort. There were good people doing good work in lots of different pockets, but it wasn’t necessarily coordinated all out of one spot.
“I think it’s really important to keep people aware, and keep it on people’s minds,” Hippensteel said. “And I think the more the community is aware of what’s happening, and the more that they know this is something for us all to be committed to, the better off we are.”
Students can reach out to the Office for Title IX Initiatives by email at tix@andrew.cmu.edu and learn more on their website at www.cmu.edu/title-ix.

With the recent reopening of the Jared L. Cohon University Center’s (CUC) revamped athletics facilities comes many overdue state-of-the-art changes. The changes include drastically improved locker rooms, new pool ventilation, and more secure facilities, to name just a few. However, one change may not be as pleasant for many longtime patrons: the new towel purchasing and washing system. 
Previously, the CUC provided all guests with a free towel service that allowed for a carefree trip to the gym: In theory, one simply had to grab a fresh towel at the start of a workout, and toss it down the laundry chute upon conclusion. In actuality, many towels were being borrowed and never returned. 
Upon the reopening of the CUC, the towel service was discontinued, and as of Oct. 1, patrons will be able to purchase a towel for the year for a $25 fee, which can then be turned in for washing. In addition, the new towels will be larger and of much nicer quality than the old ones. 
When asked about the new changes, Assistant Director of Athletics Sara Gaunter explained, “When we closed the facility in March, the athletics administration — as we always do — and we decided to implement the new service. Previously we were losing 12 to 15 dozen towels per month, which was not an efficient use of resources from an operations standpoint. This inefficient system had been running for at least the eleven years that I’ve been here.” Gaunter went on to tell The Tartan that the money being saved on towels will be used elsewhere in the recreation department, for things like hiring new instructors and purchasing new equipment.
While there are many upsides to the new system, frequent CUC recreational swimmer and Professor of English Kristina Straub told The Tartan via email, “It’s hard for the university to do anything right on this one. People used to complain all the time about how tiny and thin the towels were; it’s amazing to me that anyone would want to steal one.”
Straub also admitted that while she herself is not negatively affected by the new system, families that bring their children to the pool for lessons might be. “It’s one thing to organize a towel for yourself, another to organize towels for a whole family,” she said. 
In addition, English instructor David Cerniglia noted the understated effect the policy will have “It seems unfair that they’re asking undergraduates who are already spending a lot of money to be here — on tuition, books, and food — to spend more money to rent a towel, especially when they’re trying to do something positive like exercise. We should be making that easier.” 
On top of the economic advantages created by the new system, the school will be practicing more environmentally conscious washing methods, due to the diminished amount of water and laundry detergent needed to wash the towels. As parts of the country are ailing due to drought, decreasing laundry loads can only be a positive; the typical washing machine uses around forty gallons of water per load. 
While Straub and Cerniglia bring up the inconvenient aspects of the new system, Gautner provides the counterargument. Yet only time will tell which arguments — in conjunction with the improved environmental footprint — will outweigh the others.

Carnegie Mellon Student Government is all over social media. The Facebook statuses showed up last week, peppering timelines in the Carnegie Mellon network with information about the Undergraduate Student Senate and its various subcommittees.
The Undergraduate Student Senate is made up of 37 voting members, and each one of them is responsible for not only representing the students from their academic college, but for joining one of six committees within the body. The committees — Academic Affairs, Business Affairs, Campus Life, Communications, Finance, and Internal Development — are all a part of the larger mission of Senate: to improve the lives of students at Carnegie Mellon and the campus community as a whole, according to senior social and decision sciences major and Senate chair Julia Eddy. The committees are headed by senators who have been elected by their peers.
The heads of each committee are a part of the Executive Committee of Senate, which meets weekly to check in on the progress that each committee is making. While some of the committees overlap in their goals and projects, they all have a set of objectives that they aim to achieve within the semester and for longer term.
As the subcommittees kick off their year, most are working on projects that all serve one common purpose: making life at Carnegie Mellon easier for the students who undertake it.
Campus Life
The Campus Life Committee is headed by junior statistics major Kruti Koppolu. “The goal of the [campus life] committee is to help students reach into the Pittsburgh community and get out of the Carnegie Mellon bubble,” said Koppolu. “We want them to enrich their CMU experience that way.”
Campus Life’s agenda focuses on elements of student life, such as mental health, housing, dining, and school spirit. The Campus Life committee was responsible for putting together the Strip District Crawl of January last year, an event that was such a huge success that they are planning to host a second iteration early next semester.
“Our approach to campus life is three tiered. We focus first on how campus life impacts students, then how it impacts the campus as a whole, and finally, how we can reach out to Pittsburgh and engage with the community here,” Koppolu said.
Along with the Strip District Crawl, Campus Life will be organizing a trip Downtown to participate in Light Up Night, Pittsburgh’s celebration of the holiday season and a school spirit event during Cèilidh weekend.
Overall, Koppolu said, the goal of the committee is to bridge divisions of school, wise and ethnicity by focusing on events that highlight Carnegie Mellon’s diversity. “Students will come out to these events, meet new people, and find out more about CMU. Even if you’re a senior, there’s always something new to learn and getting involved on campus is a great way to help out. We want to make people aware that what they’re putting into CMU will come back to them,” she said.
Academic Affairs
Chaired by sophomore computer science major Eric Zhu, the Academic Affairs Committee works to improve the academic aspect of life at Carnegie Mellon. One of their primary initiatives that will be launched this semester is the faculty-student lunch program, which provides free lunches to students and faculty to encourage conversation and engagement.
The committee also focuses on how to hone in on the academic parts of campus life that may cause stress and brainstorms ways to decrease it. Zhu said that the committee has a few ideas for new projects and that they will continue to work on past initiatives to check in that they are still effective. Such efforts include mental health syllabus blurbs, professor talks, the Academic Relationships Code, and Student Spotlights.
Communications
The Communications Committee’s primary role, according to junior economics and statistics double major and committee chair Srishti Jain, is to bridge the gap that exists between the student population and Senate. “Our goal is to make the student body aware of what we’re working on, how they can get involved, and also what ideas they have that we can crowdsource from them and act on,” Jain said.
The committee is responsible for publicizing efforts and initiatives, such as the faculty-student lunch program, for which they created designs, posters, and a website. Essentially, it serves as the liaisons between the Senate and the students that Senate serves.
“Sometimes, Senate gets caught up working on all of the projects that they undertake and forgets to tell students what we’re doing for them. We work to make students aware of what Senate can offer to them,” Jain said. They are working on social media updates, website refurbishment, and a plan for Senate week to that end.
“We just want to remind people that we exist and that we’re doing things,” Jain said. “Otherwise, what’s the point of all of the work that we do?”

European Union seeks solution to Syrian, Afghan, Iraqi refugee crisis; in Vienna, Germany announces state of emergency
Last Wednesday, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, proposed a plan to begin making a dent in the massive migrant problems that have been making international headlines throughout the past month. Juncker called for each of the member countries to open their borders for a portion of 160,000 immigrants. The plan was met with significant opposition from countries that would be expected to welcome a quota of refugees from Africa or the Middle East. In the past, the European Union has failed to agree to terms that give a quota for migrants. However, with the rise of international awareness of the problem and a stronger push for reform, a search for a compromise will continue. 
Germany announced on Sunday that the country had declared a nationwide border state of emergency. Interior minister Thomas de Mazière stated that the decision was “desperately necessary” for the integrity of the German nation.

Iran nuclear deal passes in the House
On Tuesday, U.S. president Barack Obama’s Iranian Nuclear Deal passed in Congress with 41 votes. The deal will now go to the Senate, where it is unclear what the fate of the deal will be and how Democrats will strategize to pass it.

California assembly passes right-to-die legislation; governor makes final decision
On Wednesday, the California state assembly passed a bill to allow terminally ill residents to ask their physicians to administer life-ending drugs. California Governor Jerry Brown will have the final say on the bill. California has the opportunity to join Oregon, Washington, Montana, and Vermont in growing assisted suicide legislation, which is modeled after Oregon’s right-to-die law. This issue, which has been contested in California for nearly a quarter of a century, gained notoriety last year when brain cancer-stricken Brittany Maynard moved to Oregon from California to end her life.

Congratulations to Yi-Fen Chou for being featured in The Best American Poetry 2015, an annual anthology edited by David Lehman and a rotating guest editor. Shame on Michael Derrick Hudson for using the pen name Yi-Fen Chou to get his work published.
It’s no secret that writers use pen names all the time. Lewis Carroll’s real name is Charles Lutwidge Dodson. George Eliot’s real name is Mary Ann Evans. Lemony Snicket, the author of the beloved children's series A Series of Unfortunate Events? His real name is Daniel Handler.
As far as the more well-known nom de plumes go, it’s clear that they all aim for the same persona: a white male. White male names dominate literature. Anyone who doesn’t fall under that category is automatically stored away into their own subgenre. This writer is a woman; that writer identifies outside of the gender binary. But they are never just a normal writer.
Many people denied the privilege of being “normal” are constantly trying to fit themselves into a mold that Michael Derrick Hudson already fits into. His work has already been featured in numerous other publications. His biography has its own page on the Poetry Foundation’s website. Yet he’s found that using a Chinese name has helped him “place” his work in publications. In this year’s Best American Poetry, Hudson reveals that the poem featured in the anthology was rejected 40 times under his real name, but only nine times under his pen name before Prairie Schooner selected it.
As much as I want to tear Hudson’s statistical reasoning and conclusion apart, that’s obviously not the bigger issue at hand. Hudson seems to think that the privilege of being a white male with a somewhat established presence in the poetry world isn’t enough. He felt the need to take advantage of what this year's Best American Poetry’s guest editor, the famous Native American writer Sherman Alexie, calls “racial nepotism.” 
I’m not going to call out Sherman Alexie for his choice to include Hudson’s poem, even after discovering Hudson’s true identity. In fact, I respect Alexie’s decision to pay slightly more attention to an Asian-named author. The only works written by Asian writers that I can recall seeing in a big-name bookstore are Lost Names by Richard Kim and Everything I Never Told You by Celeste Ng. And even those, despite praise and merit, were buried behind copies of the latest James Patterson thriller.
To take on a name from a marginalized minority group and claim that it is to your advantage is offensive no matter which way you look at it. Asian names are constantly westernized in an attempt to make things easier for people who aren't quite as comfortable with the way each consonant rolls off their tongues. 
Moreover, names are westernized in an attempt to somehow normalize an Asian individual's identity on paper. I've had the privilege of being given a Western first name, but don't think for a second that I've never thought of legally changing my surname, or that I haven't submitted work to publications under a Western pen name. 
It is refreshing, however, to see a nonwhite name credited to excellent work. And I know I'm not the only one who feels that way, considering that more and more people are clamoring to get their hands on good work by people of color.
In a world where minorities are constantly seeking representation and want their voices to be heard, someone accidentally gave the mic to a masked Hudson. He might be able to steal a name, but he's never going to understand or want the problems that come with it.

Two weeks ago, Carnegie Mellon announced a $35 million dollar donation from Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), a tech services firm based in Mumbai, India. The gift is the fifth-largest in the university’s history, the largest donation from outside of the United States, and the largest gift that the university has ever received from a corporation.
Securing funds and donations for Carnegie Mellon has been one of University President Subra Suresh’s most prominent agenda items since he took office in November 2013. Suresh has procured deals and gifts from a variety of sources, including Uber — a five-year-old ride-sharing company already worth more than $50 billion — and Legendary Entertainment, a production company founded and chaired by Carnegie Mellon trustee Thomas Tull. 
Many of these donations are providing funding for the upcoming Tepper Quadrangle, an ongoing project that will turn what is now the Morewood Gardens parking lot into a brand-new space for university-wide learning and collaboration. The project was kicked off by a $67 million donation from David Tepper (GSIA ’82), announced the same day as Suresh’s inauguration ceremony. 
All of these donations are good for Carnegie Mellon’s national and international reputation, gradually bringing it closer to Ivy League schools like Harvard University, which received a $400 million donation this summer — its largest ever. More money is rarely a bad thing: Carnegie Mellon, like many United States institutions of higher education in recent years, is chronically underfunded. 
Many of the gifts that Carnegie Mellon has received since Suresh took office, however, have come from financially powerful corporations built on ethically shaky foundations. TCS, for example, has recently come under fire for exploiting U.S. Department of Labor policies to replace American workers with foreign-born employees on temporary H-1B visas. 
While this is a nuanced and contentious issue, TCS is playing into a flawed system by exploiting foreign-born workers — many of them from India — as part of lucrative deals with American companies who lay off thousands of American employees so that they can be replaced with relatively low-wage foreign workers. The recently laid-off employees are often forced to train their replacements, who in turn are underpaid and overworked. The system benefits no one but the companies responsible for the new contracts — companies like TCS.
Likewise, Uber has made a name for itself in its short history by strong-arming local and national governments to assert its dominance. Whether or not you support the so-called “sharing economy,” it’s undeniable that Uber’s business practices have been questionable at best. 
Although Uber was officially legalized in Pittsburgh six months ago, the company had continued to operate after a cease-and-desist order from the city’s Department of Transportation. Uber has also aggressively infringed upon the business of its largest competitor, Lyft, and was recently embroiled in a controversy after being faced with a class-action lawsuit from its drivers over their status as contractors, not employees. 
It should have come as no surprise, then, when Uber immediately poached around 40 of Carnegie Mellon’s top roboticists from the National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC) after entering into a partnership with the university in February. 
Last week, Uber announced a $5.5 million donation to the university, which many see as belated compensation for the brain drain caused by the partnership. Although the Uber-Carnegie Mellon partnership was ostensibly for the purpose of furthering research on self-driving vehicles, it sometimes feels like even the architects of the deal aren’t sure what the terms are. 
Carnegie Mellon has marketed the recent partnership with TCS as an opportunity for students to work with the internationally known tech company and create a "lasting impact." 
“As global leaders, Carnegie Mellon and TCS have the intellectual power, creativity, institutional nimbleness, and global reach to capitalize on new opportunities and have a lasting impact on society and industry through cutting-edge digital research and a long-term commitment to education,” TCS CEO and Managing Director Natarajan Chandrasekaran said in a university press release on the subject.
Still, it’s hard to see how the partnership will directly benefit students. The university’s lack of fiscal transparency makes it difficult to follow the money, and even more difficult to see how these donations improve the lives of Carnegie Mellon students. Suresh said,  for example, at the university event announcing the donation, that the money will go toward the creation of the Forbes Avenue “innovation corridor,” part of the university’s planned expansion that remains wrapped in abstraction and hyperbole. 
Although some of the money is going toward more immediate goals, like the endowment of presidential scholarships and building the new facilities of the Tepper Quadrangle, few of these projects have immediate, tangible impacts on student life. Often, Carnegie Mellon focuses more on using high-minded, empty rhetoric to please corporate sponsors than on the heart of the university — its students.
The university is also facing the problems inherent in corporate-academic partnerships and the clashing ideologies of free market-driven, globalized companies and the (theoretically) purely research-driven university. Can anyone really blame Uber, for example, for acting in its own best interest by offering higher salaries to Carnegie Mellon roboticists, many of whom are world-renowned leaders in their fields? 
Corporations have a vested interest in doing what’s best for their bottom line, while universities work toward intellectual goals, regardless of profit. These lines are becoming blurred, however, as Carnegie Mellon begins more and more to resemble the corporations that it feeds off of. 
The size and frequency of donations to the university are an important metric on many best-of lists — notably the U.S. News and World Report’s well-respected university rankings — but it’s frustrating that Carnegie Mellon is focusing on garnering donations from companies, rather than focusing on the welfare of its constituents. Carnegie Mellon needs to build its reputation from the ground up by strengthening its academic programs and catering to those who pay to attend the university: the students.

If you're planning a trip to Sesame Street, you might want to double check the address. Last month, Sesame Workshop — the nonprofit that has been producing the beloved children's educational television program since 1969 — announced a new partnership with HBO. 
When people hear "HBO," they don't usually think of brightly-colored puppets and learning the alphabet. Nonetheless, starting next season, Sesame Street will find a new home on the premium cable channel and its accompanying streaming service. It will also continue airing new episodes on PBS, but only after a nine-month wait period. 
According to Sesame Workshop CEO Jeffrey D. Dunn in USA Today, the deal "provides Sesame Workshop with the critical funding it needs to be able to continue production of Sesame Street and secure its nonprofit mission of helping kids grow smarter, stronger and kinder; it gives HBO exclusive pay cable and SVOD access to the nation’s most important and historic educational programming; and it allows Sesame Street to continue to air on PBS and reach all children, as it has for the past 45 years.” 
The massive funding and production power HBO packs will mean that Sesame Street can produce twice its usual number of episodes, as well as a spin-off program and a brand new series. In turn, HBO gets its hands on one of the longest-running and most celebrated children's shows of all time. On a practical level, the deal seems like a win-win for all parties. 
However, the ideology behind the change leaves a lot to be desired. Sesame Street was created as an all-access program for the benefit of  low-income families, who have a more difficult time providing their children with a quality formal education. At $15 a month, HBO access would strain the budgets of this original audience. 
Even though PBS will air the episodes eventually, privileged children now have first dibs, while less advantaged children must wait for their leftovers. The new paywall will ensure that the program is never again equal access across class lines. 
Sesame Workshop has sacrificed its principles in favor of the alluring glow of capitalism. Sesame Street has sold out, and while no one can be reasonably surprised, it still leaves a bitter taste in the mouth.

Amid the upcoming election season, where both politicians and "Average Joes" have focused their energy, President Obama has continued to battle against the largely Republican House of Representatives for the benefit of Middle America. Last week, Obama issued an executive order ensuring that federal contractors offer a certain number of paid sick days. 
The American federal government has historically followed the mantra of trickle-down economics. It often utilizes this as an explanation for pushing policies that minimally interfere with everyday life. What politicians fail to realize is that these policies only have long-term benefits for a small percentage of the population. 
For example: If the income tax is lowered, another tax will probably have to be raised. These are policies that give the appearance of the government working for the general welfare, but in actuality they show how stagnant America is as a nation. 
Despite this lack of progress, America is changing for the better. Although Obama's executive order will only apply to about 300,000 individuals, it shows a shift toward targeting the right demographic and within the right time frame. The policies being enacted are moving away from a “free market,” in which oligarchs reign, and into a system in which people are starting to receive the assistance they need to move themselves up in society. 
Under the Obama administration, new policies have allowed easier access to quality education, the growth of small businesses, and a plethora of other developing opportunities. The key to long-term benefits for the average American lifestyle is planning for the future. There is only a certain level of influence any president can offer toward this goal. Therefore, it is the task of Congress to move away from their old policies and place the good of the nation over the good of their constituents. 
A quote very pertinent to America’s political system is: “If you are not moving forward, you are moving backward.” During this upcoming presidential election, we will hopefully see an individual rise up and hold Congress more accountable for their lack of action in terms of progressing of America. 
America used to be a superpower with every other country envious of its success. Eventually, America got complacent with where it was as a nation, giving other countries the opportunity to rise to and even surpass its level. In essence, an unwillingness to change and progress is what has caused America to “move backward.” With Obama's executive order, the United States has finally started to move back to a competitive level.

Why has it taken this long for the Obama administration to consider accepting more Syrian refugees? 
The United States has only taken in 0.03 percent of the 4 million refugees forced to flee from the crisis that began almost five years ago in Syria, according to CNN. Since America has been a world leader in recognizing the moral responsibilities of refugee resettlement, these numbers seem especially hypocritical.
Just this week, Obama stated that the United States would resettle between 5,000 and 8,000 refugees. The International Rescue Committee is requesting those numbers be increased to 65,000. In response, National Security Council spokesman Peter Boogaard said, “It is important to note that the United States has provided over $4 billion in humanitarian assistance since the Syrian crisis began, and over $1 billion in assistance this year,” according to CNN. However, it’s evident that the funding hasn’t been enough. 
Most of the responsibility to help is being placed on the European Union, as demonstrated by media headlines such as “A European Disaster” (Slate) and “E.U. Nations Urged to Accept 160,000 Migrants” (New York Times). Meanwhile, there hasn’t been enough pressure on the United States to act. The issue is our indifference, which may have finally reached a pressure point with the heartbreaking photos of refugees that have recently been circulating the Internet.  
Following World War II, refugee resettlement in the United States was defined by two issues: who to admit, and how many to admit. Refugees were expected to help themselves from the minute they were stepped into their new home. Gradually, America began to consider a more extensive process, which has become increasingly complicated in the intervening years. 
It appears that the United States is shying away from admitting more refugees because of the complexity of the resettlement process. However, leaving the crisis to the Europeans does not live up to the United States’ reputation as a world leader. 
Refugee resettlement is a federal responsibility that calls for international attention. It is a process that must be flexible, due to the unique and specific needs that come with every crisis. America should consider clarifying quotas and even simplifying the resettlement policies. 
The fact that it takes years for refugees to be approved for resettlement is a sad excuse for inaction. If our leaders increase the number of refugees accepted, the United States can live up to its reputation of setting moral standards for the international community.

After a Title IX complaint in 2013, Carnegie Mellon University has been fighting an uphill battle toward making the school a safe and healthy environment in which to discuss gender, sexuality, and equality. 
The latest advancement in this ongoing campaign is the opening of a new office called the Office of Title IX Initiatives. The office will work to define gender equity at Carnegie Mellon, according to The Tartan's interview with part-time Interim Director of the office and Title IX Coordinator Holly Hippensteel. 
According to its website, "The Office of Title IX Initiatives is dedicated to promoting gender equity at Carnegie Mellon University, which includes coordinating the University's efforts to prevent and effectively respond to all forms of sexual misconduct impacting community members, including sexual assault, sexual harassment, dating and domestic violence, and stalking."
The university has made tremendous strides since the 2013 lawsuit, and efforts to that end should be lauded. The Tartan is proud of the steps that the university has taken, and the opening of the Office of Title IX Initiatives is no exception. This office is a key part of the learning process — for both the university and its students — on what gender equity means at a modern day university, especially one as forward-thinking as Carnegie Mellon.
The real test, however, will come during the course of its first year as the Office works to spread the word about its creation and mission on campus. The Tartan hopes that the Office will engage students and community members in meaningful conversations regarding gender equity and how it can be improved on campus.

This summer, the "research-based social innovation challenge" UpPrize announced that one recipient of their $200,000 runner-up prize was Marinus Analytics, a startup founded by Carnegie Mellon alumna Emily Kennedy (DC '12). 
Marinus uses a software called Traffic Jam to mine information online and find patterns which aid in the detection and prosecution of sex traffickers. Currently more than 75 law enforcement agencies have employed the software, and it has helped to rescue 120 victims of trafficking.
The project began as Kennedy's senior honors thesis. She took her passion for finding a solution to human trafficking to the Auton Lab in the Robotics Institute, which deals primarily with statistical data mining. Researchers there create software to sift through large amounts of data, find patterns, and implement real world solutions. In Kennedy's case, they helped track advertisements for escorts and connected the perpetrators using information in them, such as phone numbers and locations.
This kind of interdisciplinary cooperation is an underutilized benefit of attending an advanced research institution like Carnegie Mellon. The typical Tartan experience tends not to extend beyond college boundaries, except perhaps to satisfy unit requirements. The university has so many resources to offer us in terms of lab space, funding, networking, and extremely talented professors and peers. We only have access to them for four short years. It's important to take advantage of every opportunity Carnegie Mellon can offer, not just within your own major or college.
Not only do these resources give us a once-in-a-lifetime chance to grow as students and individuals, they enable us to make lasting change in the world. Kennedy's project started as a personal passion. Because she reached out and took advantage of the university's potential, it grew into a venture that is saving people's lives . Now with their new funding, Marinus has the potential to expand into counterfeit trafficking and terrorism monitoring. Students should better acquaint themselves with the interdisciplinary resources around them to better achieve their goals.

Note your color scheme and individual style. Try clean cut lines and bold colors. 
Select clothes of best quality, but always dress appropriately for the occasion. Look for classic suits or silk fabrics. 
Geminis have the biggest wardrobe of all the signs. Go for neutral attire such as jeans, shirts, waistcoats or easy jackets. 
Cancers should wear clothes with lateral cuts and a soft lunar shape. Perhaps chose colors with pink and blue tones. 
Throw on an elegant style with a juicy color. Sated color schemes such as dark blue and cherry contrast well with black and white. 
Virgo usually chooses the most practical models of clothing. You are capable of creating new fashion from simple combinations. Stay away from gray, sand and brown shades. 
Use expressive accessories to brighten your attire, such as scarfs, a handbag or a hairpin for women and a tie, a belt, or a hat for men. 
The suit of a Scorpio can look bulky, but never cheap. Be sure to wear embroideries of gold, silver, or lace. 
The natural colors for a Sagittarius are crimson, claret, and violet. 
Choose clothes which are not split by cut lines, such as a one-piece dress, a dress suit, or a double-breasted suit. 
Aquarius is involved with everything bright and out of the ordinary in fashion. Try on some open work socks or stockings in boots with lacing. 
The best fabrics for you are soft silk, jersey, and elastic. Go for washed tones of dark-blue, blue, violet, pink, and green.
