This weekend, the Carnegie Mellon’s swimming and diving teams hosted a tri-meet against the University of Rochester and Grove City College. Each tri-meet, both men’s and women’s, is scored as three unique head-to-head meets. This tri-meet saw the men winning 232–62 against Grove City and 214.5–73.5 against Rochester. The women’s team won 225–75 against Grove City and 175–124 against Rochester.
The men started off strong with a win in the 200-yard medley, with senior Josh Lucheon, first-year Matt Chu, sophomore Sivan Mehta, and sophomore Brian Jay combining for a time of 1:34.39. This was followed up by a one-two finish in the 1,000-yard freestyle with first-year Josh Taekman taking first in 9:59.51 and fellow first-year Alex Glidden right behind in 10:13.51.
The Tartans kept up their blistering pace as they had another one-two finish in the 200-yard freestyle, this time with junior Steven Geier taking first in 1:45.23 and senior Andrew Yee taking second with a time of 1:46.36. In the 100-yard backstroke, Carnegie Mellon had to settle for just first place as Mehta claimed the top spot with a time of 52.93.
Chu kept up the trend of relay participants also winning their individual competitions, taking the 100-yard breaststroke in a time of 58.55, just before the Tartans swept the top spots in the 200-yard butterfly with sophomore Brian Walsh, senior Dave Campbell, and first-year Edward Healy touching the wall with times of 1:54.45, 1:56.79 and 1:59.79, respectively.
The next win for the Tartans was actually a tie in the 200-yard backstroke when first-year Michael DiBacco tied with a Rochester swimmer with a time of 1:57.54. This was quickly redeemed in the 200-yard breaststroke when junior Matthew Nielson, Jay, and Chu finished one-two-three with times of 2:11.47, 2:14.61, and 2:15.20, respectively. Yee, Tackman, and Glidden repeated the feat in the 500-yard freestyle with times of 4:48.62, 4:48.63, and 4:53.94, respectively.
In the 100-yard butterfly, Carnegie Mellon managed to only win, and not sweep, the podium, with Walsh taking the victory in 51.50, but quickly returned to domination when Nielson, sophomore Jay Jin, and senior Roy Sung took the top three spots in the 200-yard individual medley with times of 1:57.77, 1:58.35, and 2:01.99. To cap off their domination, the Tartans took the final swimming event, with Jay, Tackman, Mehta, and first-year Kevin Steinhouse winning the 200-yard freestyle relay in a time of 1:26.87.
On the diving side, juniors Noah Fatsi and Yannos Michailidis were still a ways behind their competition, but showed a marked improvement from the beginning of the season, particularly in the 1-meter dive.
For the women, dominance was the expectation and the result starting from the first event where first-year Anna Wong, junior Felicia Wang, sophomore Gillian Crews, and first-year Tiana Marrese combined for the 200-yard medley relay in 1:49.70. First-year Emma Shi had the next Tartan victory in the 200-yard freestyle with a tie of 1:57.85 followed by a one-two-three finish for Wong, junior Kira Singhaus and first-year Brinda Malhotra in the 100-yard backstroke in times of 1:00.46, 1:01.09, and 1:02.22.
First-year Kim Hochstedler and Wang combined for a one-two finish in the 100-yard breaststroke with times of 1:08.00 and 1:08.76, respectively, before Shi, Malhotra, and junior Paige Sieffert finished one-two-three in the 200-yard backstroke, touching the wall at the 2:09.27, 2:12.69, and 2:14.64 marks, respectively. This feat was matched in the next event when Hochstedler, sophomore Natalie Kronfli, and Wang went one-two-three in the 200-yard breaststroke in 2:30.51, 2:32.90, and 2:33.79, respectively. In the 200-yard individual medley, Carnegie Mellon only managed a one-two finish, with Shi and first-year Mary St. John touching the wall in 2:11.73 and 2:16.81, respectively.
On the diving side, the women were more competitive than the men, but still failed to win with sophomore Machika Kaku coming closest with a second place finish in the 1-meter dive.
Both Tartan teams will next swim on Saturday when they host Washington and Lee University and Allegheny College.

The weekend started off with a suspenseful series of matches in the UAA volleyball championships on Friday.
Carnegie Mellon’s women’s team got off to a strong start after defeating its first opponent, New York University (NYU), 3–0. During the first set, Carnegie Mellon successfully stayed ahead of the opposing side amid serving errors, attack errors, and other penalties. First-year outside hitter, Heather Holton, was responsible for seven of Carnegie Mellon’s kills and had earned the most points that way on the team.
During the second set, Carnegie Mellon seemingly started off on a weak foot, with NYU ahead by two points due to attack errors by the Tartans and kills from NYU. 
However, this underdog status did not last long, as Carnegie Mellon slowly caught up, with Holton smashing a non-redeemable hit and NYU making another service error. NYU maneuvered themselves another step, but a kill made by senior right side hitter Ali Celentano and an unfortunate attack error on NYU’s side caused them to wallow in temporary defeat.
Eventually, both sides were tied 6–6, but from that point on, the numbers on NYU’s scoreboard took a ride downhill until the end of that round, with sophomore setter and opposite hitter Emily Newton making the winning kill for that round. In the third set, a series of penalties on NYU’s side granted four consecutive points to the Tartans after two initial kills were made by sophomore middle blocker Jackie Gibbons and first-year middle blocker Eliza Donohue. This set ended with NYU losing to Carnegie Mellon 23–1 during which Carnegie Mellon players Holton, Celentano, Gibbons, and Donohue scored three points each, making the majority of the team’s points.
At this point, Carnegie Mellon’s first match in the UAA had ended and the team secured its position to face their next opponent: No. 6 Emory University. 
This game, though it started out hopeful, did not finish as it had started.
Though the match started with Holton making two kills on the first three points, Emory followed up with two consecutive points. 
Though Carnegie Mellon did keep scoring after that, they seemed to progress much more slowly than Emory. More often than not, either Emory kept making kills or Carnegie Mellon kept making serving or attacking errors. Numerous times after Carnegie Mellon made their fifth point in the first set, Carnegie Mellon players just could not manage to convert.
Gibbons would have been able to keep up the game for the Tartans if she had landed the ball within the boundary on Emory’s side. 
Holton, who had excelled in the first game, seemed to be on the verge of losing her winning streak, since she made more out-of-bounds hits even though she also scored three times.
In the second set, Emory started getting ahead of the game after both sides scored three points. 
With Emory leading 11–4, it appeared that the visiting team’s players made more ruthless shots, as can be observed from Donohue failing to block a hit. However, Donohue redeemed her position by blocking the very next shot, earning Carnegie Mellon a point.
After that, it seemed that most of Emory’s points were gained from Carnegie Mellon’s service and attack errors. These errors occurred in five consecutive shots, as Emory increased their score from four to five while Carnegie Mellon stayed at three. This happened again later in the set when Emory went from 19 to 21 and the Tartans maintained nine points.
In the third set, however, the Tartans scored consecutive shots, first starting from a service by Emory, followed by kills from Gibbons and sophomore middle blocker and outside hitter Casey Salandra. The biggest triumph during that set was probably the point made after those shots. Celetano served a ball that could not be returned, putting Carnegie Mellon in a tie at 10–10. More consecutive shots were made as Salandra and Newton smashed shots that were faster than the receiving opponent’s reflexes. However, the points were not enough to triumph in the end, and the final score was 25–20, Emory.
Though the ladies had a promising start and fought long and hard, they did not progress to the next challenge in the UAA Championship matches. However, they did receive an opportunity to play against Washington University in the third place match.
Carnegie Mellon finished in fourth after dropping to No. 5 Washington University in straight sets.

The Carnegie Mellon football team looked flat Saturday as it was handed a 28–7 loss by the University of Chicago.
Carnegie Mellon let up a touchdown in every quarter, and could not muster any points of its own until the team’s last drive in the fourth quarter. The Tartans had a particularly difficult time protecting junior quarterback Andrew Hearon, who was sacked nine times. He was under pressure on every play, and was forced into two ugly interceptions, one of which doomed Carnegie Mellon’s first of two trips to the red zone.
Carnegie Mellon’s first drive of the game took 5:10 off the clock. This might have been their best drive of the day, as they stayed on schedule and consistently picked up short gains, moving the chains and into the edge of Chicago’s red zone. However, two consecutive sacks on secondw and third downs dragged the Tartans from the 22-yard line all the way back to the 34, and they were forced to punt the ball away, coming up empty. The drive immediately following saw Chicago score a touchdown on a 50-yard run, setting the tone for a very long day for the Tartans’ defense.
As the first quarter came to a close, Carnegie Mellon’s offense stalled deep in their own territory, punting the ball away and giving Chicago excellent field position.
The Maroons capitalized and punched the ball in on a 15-yard crossing route, extending their lead to 14–0.
Both teams traded punts and fumbles, but neither offense could make any noise until the break, and the score stayed that way through halftime. The second half started differently. The Tartans defense could not get a stop, allowing Chicago to make consistent gains and passes for first down after first down. Even a holding penalty did not stop the Chicago offense, as an 11-yard touchdown pass put Chicago up three scores, seemingly putting the game out of reach for Carnegie Mellon. The Tartans responded well, however, putting up their longest drive on the day. They ran four plays for gains of 3, 17, 13, and 19 yards to set themselves up on Chicago’s 17-yard line before Hearon forced one into the end zone, turning the ball over and ceding Carnegie Mellon’s first real chance to score.
Afterwards, both teams traded punts, but an interception by first-year safety Drew Fitzmorris stopped a Chicago drive deep in Carnegie Mellon territory. The ensuing drive by the Tartans was moving down the field smoothly, but disaster struck at midfield, as Hearon’s second interception of the day was returned for a touchdown, burying Carnegie Mellon in a 28–0 hole.
By that point, the game was effectively over. Consecutive turnovers on downs gave Carnegie Mellon the ball with great field position, but only just over five minutes left. Carnegie Mellon quickly got deep into Chicago’s half of the field, setting up first and goal from the Chicago nine-yard line. An incompletion, sack, and another incompletion, however, left Carnegie Mellon staring down fourth-and-goal from the 18-yard line. 
A desperate heave from Hearon somehow split two defenders and stuck to the hands of junior wide receiver Chris Herrera, but it was too little too late. Chicago ran the clock to its expiration on the following drive, capping a 28–7 loss for Carnegie Mellon. The loss leaves Carnegie Mellon at 3–6, (3–5), and finishes a winless slate of away games.
Carnegie Mellon will attempt to move to 4-1 at home and nab their first victory since a 21-10 win over Grove City on Oct. 18 in a UAA contest against Washington University next Saturday.

On Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s soccer teams finished up regular season play against Emory University. The men tied No. 14 Emory 0–0 to finish 8–5–3 overall and 2–2–3 in University Athletic Association (UAA) play. The fourth-ranked women lost to No. 24 Emory 1–0 but were still able to claim the first-ever UAA championship for the program on the back of their 5–2–0 UAA record and 14–2–0 overall record.
As expected in a 0–0 draw, the men’s game featured a lot of defense and some outstanding goalkeeper play. Senior goalkeeper Jacob Rice was outstanding throughout the game, and was tested early when the defense allowed a cross in the ninth minute. Rice was forced to make a diving save and managed to tip the ball off of the crossbar.
Overall, the Tartans and Emory were about even on shots, with 10 for Carnegie Mellon and 12 for the Eagles. The difference came in shots on goal. Junior midfielder Connor Webb had trouble shooting online, as he only forced a save on one of his six shots for the game. This was one of only two shots on goal for the Tartans, with junior midfielder Stefan Dasbach getting the second. In comparison, eight of Emory’s 12 shots required a save, with Rice making seven of them and a blocked shot denying the eighth.
The game started to get a little rougher toward the end, with a yellow card for Emory in the second half. Carnegie Mellon received two yellow cards in overtime: one in the first overtime period to senior defender Ian Rosado, and one in the second period to junior defender Greg Allen.
For the women’s game, it was a similar story of goalkeeping and defense, this time with Emory striking a shot low toward the far post past otherwise perfect sophomore keeper Katie Liston in the 69th minute.
The women had a similar problem to the men with an inability to convert shots into shots on goal, as they led Emory 9–5 in shots, but trailed 5–4 in shots on goal. 
First-year midfielder Tori Iatarola was the leading shooter for the Tartans but was also only two of five for shots on goal compared to shots taken.
Regardless of this loss, the Tartans still automatically qualify for the NCAA Championship Tournament based on their UAA Championship. The NCAA selection show will take place at 1 p.m. Monday and will be streamed live for those who want to see Carnegie Mellon’s path to a national championship.

At a recent Pugwash meeting, the discussion group examined the social implications of filter bubbles, a factor which isolates Internet users from outside viewpoints.
Information bubbles have always existed. For example, our communities isolate us from outside ideas to a certain extent. Many hoped the Internet would bring us into a larger, more diverse community, exposing us to a larger universe of ideas. Paradoxically, in many ways it has had the opposite effect.
While the Internet allows access to new ideas, it also gives us greater access to others sharing our own beliefs. People continue to isolate themselves within small groups, but now these groups can be even more homogeneous than ever. Twenty years ago there may have been two or three newspapers to choose from. With each newspaper serving diverse subscribers, everyone in a community read roughly the same news. Now that it is possible to choose between hundreds of electronic subscriptions, the news that two different people read may have little in common.
A completely new factor keeping users isolated from differing viewpoints is the personalized content that platforms such as Google, Facebook, and Yahoo News produce. These platforms customize what we see based on our location, Internet browser, computer type, frequency of travel, who our friends are, our search history, and what links we have clicked on in the past. All this information goes into determining our search results, whose updates will show up in our Facebook feed, and what articles will be in our Yahoo News headlines. As Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google, commented, “[Soon] it will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them.”
This type of personalization is convenient, but creates filter bubbles in which users are isolated from content they disagree with or would find uncomfortable. What is particularly worrying about filter bubbles is that few users are aware that they are in one. If it were not for filter bubbles, users would be aware of outside information, even if they chose not to examine it. However, with personalized results, users may honestly believe that no debate exists over controversial topics, or that raging debate exists over settled ones. There are important discussions to be had on how filter bubbles might affect civic discourse, people’s susceptibility to propaganda, and whether they might lead to greater divides within our society.
Personalized content gives us what we want to see, but is that content what is best for us? Filter bubbles also raise the question of whether the providers of our Internet content have a civic responsibility to show us just what we want, or to leave open windows into the wider world. One of our members suggested adding scalable options to search engines for the amount of filtering applied to uncomfortable content and for alternative points of view.
If you would like to escape your filter bubble, you can try the popular alternative search engine DuckDuckGo, which does not individually customize results. You might also try subscribing to a large mainstream newspaper, in lieu of personalized headlines, such as those from Yahoo News. Perhaps most importantly, make an effort to click on articles on uncomfortable topics or ones that challenge your point of view. After all, filter bubbles are only the streamlined process of the filtering which we already engage in.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article summarizes their discussion on filter bubbles.

In today’s society, the term virus is widely understood due to its role in common, well-known diseases. Nevertheless, there is still much that is unknown about the mechanisms that control viral function. Recent findings by Alex Evilevitch, associate professor of physics at Carnegie Mellon University, have shed light on several of the mechanisms behind viral infection.
Many viruses consist of double-stranded DNA surrounded by a protein coat called a capsid. For replication of the DNA to occur, the DNA is injected into a host cell. After the cell has replicated the DNA, it is once again packaged back into the capsid of the virus. Evilevitch, along with Fred Homa, herpes virologist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, examined the mechanism behind the transfer of viral DNA from the capsid into the host cell.
In prior research, Evilevitch and his team measured the pressure inside bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacteria cells. The team discovered that the force driving DNA from the virus into the host cell is a mechanical pressure, which suggests that large physical forces could be involved in viral infection.
“That was the breakthrough measurement,” Evilevitch said. “I was then interested to see if similar mechanisms can be found in eukaryotic viruses or, more importantly, human viruses.” The researchers found that the herpes virus was the human virus most similar to the bacteriophages they had been studying, as it had a very similar structure. This discovery led the researchers to measure the pressure inside the herpes virus. Their results ended up being very similar to the phage measurement, suggesting that it followed the same mechanism of DNA release into a cell as the bacteriophage.
This discovery led to many more questions, namely about the physical structure of the viral DNA. The researchers were aware that DNA, at the density required in a virus, is packed in a rigid crystalline structure. They had also measured the rate of DNA release from the herpes virus and determined that the release was an extremely quick process.
“The big question was: If DNA is packaged like a solid crystal, how can it be released so quickly at tens of thousands of base pairs per second into the cell and cause infection?” Evilevitch said. To answer this question, the team used atomic force microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering to image the virus at different temperatures and to determine the stiffness of DNA packaged inside the virus, which in turn, allowed them to measure the fluidity of the DNA.
“We were interested to see whether biological temperature would have an effect on the structure of the DNA that could potentially explain how DNA is released in the cell during infection,” Evilevitch explained. “We found that DNA stiffness in the capsid undergoes a rapid drop at the temperature of infection. This showed us that at that point, DNA doesn’t show any resistance and is completely fluid, which suggests that it can be freely released and infect the cell.” Evilevitch explained that this result clearly illustrates the concept of viral metastability, the idea that a virus needs to be stable in between infections, but unstable during infection in order to transfer its DNA to the host cell. 
“Previous studies tried to show that the capsid was metastable. We found for the first time that it’s actually also the genome that’s metastable,” Evilevitch said. “Inside the virus when the environment is not favorable for infection, such as at lower temperatures, it behaves like a solid crystal. When the physical environment is optimized for infection, such as at infection temperature, DNA can freely flow from the virus into the cell nucleus and initiate infection.”
Evilevitch explained that the research had a dual purpose, to further understand the mechanism behind viral infections and to develop potential treatments that inhibit those mechanisms. 
If methods of inhibiting the viral DNA phase transition can be developed, the virus becomes essentially noninfectious. “Herpes is a serious health issue — it’s the second largest human pathogen after influenza,” Evilevitch noted. “These studies suggest a completely new approach to the development of antiviral herpes treatments.”
The research, supported by the Swedish Research Council, the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the McWilliams Fellowship at Carnegie Mellon, was published in Nature Chemical Biology and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

When robots appear in movies, they’re not usually friendly — think of the personal robots gone bad in I, Robot, or Arnold Schwarzenegger with his skin melted off and his metal skull showing at the end of the original Terminator.
In 2008, Disney first showed viewers friendly (and adorable) robots in Wall-E, which told the love story of two post-apocalyptic robots working together to save the human race. In Big Hero 6, which premiered on Friday, Disney plays upon a little-talked about ’90s Marvel comic book series to tell the story of a boy, his robot, and his team of superhero pals. Big Hero 6 takes place in the futuristic San Fransokyo, a mash-up of two existing technologically advanced cities. In the movie, Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter), a budding roboticist, meets Baymax, a personal health care robot created by Hiro’s older brother, Tadashi (Daniel Henney). Together, Hiro and Baymax — along with their friends Gogo, Wasabi, Honey, and Fred — save the city from a masked man with an army of “microbots” (small robots invented by Hiro himself).
When he meets Baymax, Hiro also meets Professor Callaghan, played by Carnegie Mellon alumnus James Cromwell (CFA ’64), who’s not a stranger to working in movies starring robots after playing a robotics researcher in I, Robot.
Baymax isn’t like the Terminator, or even Wall-E and his robot love interest, Eve — instead Baymax is soft and huggable, a robot designed to be safe for personal use. While looking for inspiration for Baymax, Disney researchers visited the soft robotics lab at Carnegie Mellon, where researchers like Chris Atkeson, a professor in the university’s Robotics Institute, have been working to create soft, safe robots.
“About 15 years ago there was a project called NurseBot, which said ‘let’s make something that acts like a nurse in a hospital,’” Atkeson said about how soft robotics research got started at Carnegie Mellon. “And that was followed by a number of National Science Foundation projects, most in the Quality of Life Technology Center.” 
The Quality of Life Technology Center is a National Science Foundation-funded research center that “adapts robotic technology to meet the needs of the elderly and people with disabilities,” according to a university news release on Carnegie Mellon’s role in the creation of Big Hero 6. Up until then, Atkeson said, researchers were working exclusively on what he called “metal monsters.” “Metal monsters,” Atkeson said, are too dangerous to work closely with humans. “You know, if you have a robot that brushes your teeth or combs your hair, you really don’t want a metal monster. It’s like asking someone to brush their teeth by taping a toothbrush to the bumper of a car and having someone else drive back and forth with the car while their mouth is on the brush.”
Atkeson said that he draws inspiration from pool toys, balloon animals — anything inflatable. When asked what a soft robot would feel like, Atkeson responded, “Have you ever been in a bouncy castle? Just like that.”
In 2011, when Disney started doing research for Big Hero 6, Co-Director Don Hall visited the Robotics Institute for inspiration. There, Hall saw a soft robotic arm developed in Atkeson’s lab by Siddharth Sana, a doctoral candidate in the Robotics Institute at the time.
“I met a researcher who was working on soft robots,” Hall was quoted as saying about his visit to Carnegie Mellon. “It was an inflatable vinyl arm, and the practical app would be in the health care industry as a nurse or doctor’s assistant. He had me at vinyl. This particular researcher went into this long pitch but the minute he showed me that inflatable arm, I knew we had our huggable robot.”
Baymax works in health care, just like Atkeson envisions soft robots doing in the real world future. Baymax, however, isn’t completely soft.
“Here we get an interesting divergence: For a variety of technical reasons, it was easier for animators to put ‘bones’ back in,” Atkesons said. “So in the movie, Baymax has a skeleton. You just can’t see it. And even when they do show you what the insides are like, you barely see the skeleton at all; they don’t make a big deal of it.”
Atkeson’s goal with soft robots is to reduce mass, because, as he said in another interview, “Mass kills.” So, the soft robots developed at Carnegie Mellon are made of polyurethane supported by cables.
“It sounds crazy,” Atkeson said. “You think a robot like that would be really weak, but it turns out you can make it fairly strong, and there are a lot of different engineering techniques to do that.”
Since Hall looked at the soft robot arm in 2011, Atkeson said, soft robotics have come a long way at Carnegie Mellon. Carmel Majidi, who was hired as an assistant professor of mechanical engineering in 2011, and Yong-Lae Park, who was hired as an assistant professor in the Robotics Institute and School of Computer Science in 2013, have joined Atkeson.To Atkeson, soft robots are a natural progression in the field of robotics. 
“Let’s face it. Eventually we’re going to have robot friends — you’re going to stop having a relationship with your iPhone, and start having a relationship with your robot friend,” he said. “I bet your robot buddy will be soft, too.”

Games are becoming more immersive than ever due to the many new technologies used to enhance play and the systems they can be played on. But as Robin Hunicke, co-founder of the independent game studio Funomena said in a Human-Computer Interaction Seminar Series lecture last Wednesday, “It is not the technology that makes games new or interesting right now. To me, what’s compelling about games as a medium right now is that they are exploring deeper subjects via interactivity and empowering people.” To Hunicke, games have expanded into a new platform on which to convey messages and experiences, and will become even more influential as games become more and more interesting.
As a young girl, Hunicke was attracted to games and activities that allowed her to flex her creative muscle. As a result, she loved the arts, writing, and music. This passion for creativity pushed her to do an interdisciplinary study at the University of Chicago, where she “ended up majoring in women’s studies, computer science, fine arts, film, oral narrative, and computer programming.” Although she hadn’t planned on studying computer science, she realized that she could combine many interesting fields and represent them in programs and applications.
After she completed her undergraduate degree, Hunicke went to graduate school at Northwestern University, where she became interested in artificial intelligence (AI) and heard of an interesting theory that making the AI in a game better would also improve users’ experiences with the game. As a result, she decided to research whether or not this was true. However, she found that just improving this mechanism did not make the user experience better, leading her to develop the Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics (MDA) framework, a formal approach to game design and game research that allows all parties to better understand what makes a game better. The MDA framework can describe how emotional aesthetics or feelings can be conveyed to the player of a game. Most importantly, Hunicke realized that she could apply this knowledge to commercial games.
Hunicke first began working at Electronic Arts — an American developer, marketer, publisher, and distributor of video games — on The Sims. She first went through a learning phase where she tried to understand the communication aspect of her job. She realized that there were many creative ideas that were all put out, but needed to be blended into something that would convey a feeling. As she started to run her own team, she asked herself, “What is it about making games that makes it so hard?” She found that there were many aspects to running the team that she had previously neglected, but said that it was an interesting experience. She also found that game development teams turned out to be extremely top heavy, where huge franchise games started sucking money from the more casual smaller games.
This realization led her to want to create “elegant, expressive, emotional games that we haven’t made yet,” or a “triple E,” as she calls it.
Hunicke wanted a game that not only would be easy to create, but also would make the user experience more expressive. She wanted the user to experience new feelings and allow them to respond to the experience. She began to map the many games that had been made to figure out what types of games could be found at the extremes — “the extreme triple E game.” As she began work on her new game Journey, she and her team tried to implement these goals.
In the end, the game won many awards, but she still felt that it was not a perfect triple E game. She asked herself if it was maybe the background of the people who worked on the game, or possbily just the working environment. Although they had not achieved that ideal game, she realized what she could do in order to create a good game. Hunicke  found that prototyping and removing elements repeatedly would help in creating a polished game — using this process would allow others to create a triple E game that would connect with the player.
Now, Hunicke is trying to make a “feeling-first company” that prioritizes feelings in games above other things. She wanted to work on a big idea while taking into account human-centered design. As she said, “The games that I love were made by people who wanted to communicate with me about their feelings.” This notion is why she has co-founded Funomena, a company that holds these ideals at heart.

Remember those simple calculators that had a dark black rectangle above the screen and stopped working when you put your finger over it? 
That dark black rectangle consists of solar cells, cells that require light to operate. But how do those cells actually convert light into the electricity used to power the calculator?
The idea of utilizing light and the sun’s energy isn’t a new concept. In the seventh century, B.C., magnifying glasses were used to concentrate the sun’s rays to make fire. Allegedly, in 212 B.C., Greek scientist Archimedes used bronze shields to focus sunlight and set fire to Roman wooden ships attacking Syracuse. 
But “modern” investigations of solar energy really kicked off in 1839 when French scientist Edmond Becquerel discovered the photovoltaic effect. Using an electrolytic cell, he observed that the generation of electricity increased when the cell was exposed to sunlight. Since then, it’s been discovery after discovery, from Einstein’s photoelectric effect in 1905 to the development of the first silicon solar cell by Daryl Chapin, Calvin Fuller, and Gerald Pearson of Bell Labs in 1954.
Solar cells, also called photovoltaic cells, are made up of semiconductors, materials that have a conductivity between that of an insulator and a conductor. When light strikes the cell, the semiconductor absorbs a portion of it. As the semiconductor absorbs energy from the sun, electrons in the semiconductor are knocked loose, allowing them to flow freely and create a current. By placing metal rods on the top and bottom of the solar cell, that current can be captured and the resulting electricity can be used for power.
According to energy.gov, the most common semiconductor used for solar cells is silicon, due to its crystalline structure. The silicon atom contains four valence electrons, resulting in a half-filled outer shell. Silicon shares these electrons with four other silicon atoms, which share their four valence electrons with four other silicon atoms, et cetera, resulting in the crystalline structure necessary for a solar cell to work.
However, since silicon on its own does not conduct electricity well, other atoms are added to silicon’s structure; for example, there could be one phosphorous atom for every million silicon atoms. Because phosphorous has five valence electrons in its outer shell, it bonds with four silicon atoms and has one electron left over. 
When the solar cell absorbs sunlight, those extra electrons are knocked loose and can flow freely.
The process of adding other atoms to silicon’s structure is called doping. When doped with phosphorous, like the above example, the silicon is called n-type — “n” for negative because of the free flowing electrons that have negative charge. When doped with an element like boron, which has three valence electrons in its outer shell, the silicon is called p-type — “p” for positive because instead of free electrons there are free openings that carry positive charge.
The solar cell actually begins working when the n-type and p-type silicon come into contact with each other, creating an electric field as the free flowing electrons in the n-type begin to occupy the free openings in the p-type. When light hits the cell, electrons are knocked out of the openings, again creating free flowing electrons that seek the free openings. Therefore, there is a constant flow of electrons when light hits the cell, providing the current. The cell’s electric field provides the voltage, resulting in the power needed to run your calculator.
Currently, scientists are researching ways to make solar cells more efficient and competitive with more traditional energy sources. 
The main problem is cost — although sunlight is free, the electricity generated from solar cells is not; we have to factor in the cost of making the solar cells as well as the cost of installing them, remembering that solar cells don’t convert 100 percent of the light it absorbs. 
Furthermore, solar cells only work when there is sunlight, so scientists are also researching ways to not only harness the energy from sunlight, but to effectively store it. 
With enough time, solar cells and solar energy are a promising green technology that can positively affect our future energy consumption.

Orbital Sciences plans to replace Antares’ engines 
In the aftermath of the Antares rocket explosion on Oct. 28, its manufacturer, the Orbital Sciences company, announced plans to replace the Antares’ AJ26 first-stage engines by 2017. The Antares rocket explosion caused the destruction of the company’s unmanned Cygnus spacecraft, resulting in the loss of 5,000 pounds in supplies that were intended to be delivered to the International Space Station, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
The Orbital Sciences Corporation reports evidence that approximately 15 seconds after ignition, one of the two AJ26 engines failed. Lately, the company has been scrutinized for using AJ26 parts, which were built more than 40 years ago for the Soviet Union’s ill-fated N1 moon rocket. 
The rocket engines were then later refurbished by an American company.

Bats compete when hunting prey via jamming calls
Biologists Aaron Corcoran and William Conner, respectively from the University of Maryland and Wake Forest University, have conducted a study on the competition among Mexican free-tailed bats in the search for prey at night. They found that bats use jamming calls in an attempt to distract their competitors as they hunt for prey. Their research took place in a research station in Arizona and in a high school parking lot in Animas, N.M. In one experiment, the team used highly-sensitive cameras and a specialized array of ultrasonic microphones to trace the interactions between traveling bats using emitted sounds. In another experiment, they lured bats with moths suspended on delicate fishing lines, while performing jamming calls. From their data, the biologists determined that jamming calls from exterior sources, given the right time and frequency, were able to cause a bat to miss its prey.

Tech company develops new exoskeleton suit
An advanced technology company, Lockheed Martin, has created an exoskeleton suit that can take off 36 pounds of weight from the users’ hands and arms, and transfer that weight to the ground. 
While the exoskeleton, known as the Fortis, contains 30 pounds of anodized aluminum and carbon fiber, the suit actually feels weightless to the user. The Fortis also has joints that parallel those normally in the human body and is able to flex across the waist. Fortis minimizes muscle fatigue, increasing productivity of the users. Its design team found that workers could hold a 16-pound grinder overhead for as long as 30 continuous minutes, which is a major improvement from the maximum three minutes without the suit.
The suit was also designed to give users the flexibility of moving in complex environments, such as climbing up the stairs or a ladder.

Cretaceous footprints found in diamond mine
Paleontologists discovered ancient track marks of Cretaceous vertebrates in the Catoca diamond mine, the world’s fourth largest diamond mine.
The fossils are said to be the first record of Cretaceous vertebrates in inland Angola. Finding the footprints of these large mammals was significant, as ancient warm-blooded animals were often too small to leave durable track marks.
In the past, after some animal tracks were discovered, members of the PaleoAngola Project asked the diamond mine to help preserve the footprints, to which the diamond mine cooperated. The PaleoAngola Project is an international effort to investigate vertebrate paleontology in Angola.
Months later, paleontologists came to the mine and discovered ripple marks in the stone surrounding the fossils, suggesting that a shallow lake may have attracted the mammals.

Dopamine levels are connected to Parkinson’s
In a recent study from the Cell Stem Cell journal, researchers from Lund University were able to restore motor function in a rat model of Parkinson’s disease. Authors Malin Parmar and Shane Grealish transplanted neurons taken from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into brain regions that dictated movement in the rat.
Affecting millions worldwide, Parkinson’s disease is an incurable, progressive disorder that involves the loss of control over dexterity and the speed of movement. Its current treatment options often cause side effects and decrease in effectiveness over time. Part of the disease can be attributed to the death of neurons, causing low levels of dopamine release in the brain. But within five months, after successfully transplanting the cells, the researchers were able to restore dopamine to its normal levels, as well as establish a correct pattern of long-distance connections in the brain.

Neurologists find a way to create “ghostly presence”
In a recent paper from the journal Current Biology, a team of Swiss neurologists identified a possible reason for the “feeling of a presence” (FoP) phenomenon. FoP occurs when a person falsely senses that somebody is physically nearby, contributing to the belief of a “ghostly presence.”
After studying brain activity in patients with severe cases of FoP, the scientists recreated the neurological experience in healthy volunteers. Blindfolded, subjects were asked to perform a series of movements with their arms. Robots hooked up to the patients would mimic the subjects’ movements while tracing the subjects’ backs.
The group found that by delaying the robot’s movement, a subject would experience FoP, which they concluded is caused by mismatches in sensorimotor signals.

A friend’s dad told her that she needed to be uplifted, so he bought us tickets to see St. Paul & The Broken Bones at Mr. Smalls Funhouse on Wednesday. While I wasn’t lifted entirely to heaven, I was lifted pretty close to it. The outing provided an escape from the weekly Carnegie Mellon grind, with some smooth, jazzy soul, and an opener that I enjoyed more than the headliner.
St. Paul & The Broken Bones performed songs from their first and only studio album Half the City. Paul Janeway, the lead vocalist, blew the pulpit out of the church-turned-concert-venue with his commanding range, and arsenal of soul-stopping dance moves.
During many of the songs, Janeway shuffled his feet across the stage with his hands in the air and his head to the ground as he belted out a scream. During others, he panned his hands across the crowd as if speaking to every concert-goer in the standing room. When he pointed out into the crowd whispering sweet words of endearment, it seemed as if he was truly speaking to the individuals milling about in the back of the venue near the bar.
Accompanying Janeway were guitarists, a drummer, and a pianist, as well as standout trumpet and trombone players — without whom the band would not have its jazzy soul sound. The trumpet and trombone seemed to come in at the perfect moments to compliment Janeway’s raspy, yet sensual voice.
As part of a three-song closing, Janeway and the band performed “Call Me”, the band’s most popular number. The energy from the crowd almost matched Janeway’s energy — which is a feat considering that a kid hyped up on candy would have a hard time matching his energy. Where Janeway really shined though was in his cover of ”Try a Little Tenderness”. Janeway continually belted out notes that seemed to exhaust him, theatrically panting after each one, before the band kicked up the tempo of the song and continued on. Janeway eventually fell to the ground as the band played on and a guitarist checked on him. He jumped up in a burst of energy one more time to deliver a last walloping bout of song before collapsing for good.
But the headliner wasn’t my favorite part of the show.
Jessica Hernandez & The Deltas opened for St. Paul & the Broken Bones with a sweet, smooth set. Although I had not heard of the band before that night, I was able to peacefully bop my head along to Hernandez’s mellow voice accompanied by two guitarists, a pianist, drummer, and trombone player. Hernandez’s presence on the stage was captivating as she romped around the stage in a floral shirt and brightly patterned skirt. 
Hernandez made it apparent that she and the rest of the band members were like a bandwagon of siblings: jamming out with the guitarists, and even grabbing an extra pair of drum sticks for one song to produce her own beats alongside the drummer during a lengthy instrumental break.
Hernandez was also able to do something that St. Paul & The Broken Bones did not: engage the audience. While the headliner had fans in the crowd who knew the words to their music, they did not interact with the crowd beyond mentioning previous visits to Pittsburgh and the larger Pennsylvania state. Meanwhile, Hernandez admitted to the crowd that she assumed most of her music was new to their ears. Nevertheless, during one song, she commanded the audience to crouch to the ground and slowly rise with her while she built up the beat before telling everyone to dance.
“And for those of you who hated that, this is ballad,” Hernandez joked, before whisking the audience into the slow, almost heartbreaking ”Cry Cry Cry” from what is also this band’s only full album Secret Evil. 
The song, a deviation from the band’s usual upbeat, raw sound, was pleasant to sway to amid the feet-stomping tunes that surrounded it.
Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed St. Paul & The Broken Bones’s soulful songs that made me feel as if Mr. Smalls was being transformed back into the church it once was. It may have just been that Hernandez’s music was more in line with what I listen to when I put in my headphones, but I almost would have preferred that she was the headliner with St. Paul & The Broken Bones as the opener.
Thanks for the tickets, Mr. Goldberg!

To an outsider, the life of a professional musician can seem like easy street. You sit around and come up with songs, then go play said songs before stadiums of screaming fans on tours that typically last one calendar season — two if you’re big in Japan. This dream may be true in some cases — Tiesto, Justin Bieber; I’m looking at you — but for most musicians it’s a constant stream of session gigs, long treks back and forth across middle America in a Dodge Ram, and impassioned performances in half-empty clubs.
Borahm Lee and Adam Deitch, who together comprise the electronic hip-hop duo Break Science and who played a spectacular show to a small crowd at Mr. Smalls Funhouse on Thursday, are two artists who embody that determined spirit. Both have toured and worked with countless other artists, including Pretty Lights, The Fugees,Talib Kweli, and 50 Cent. Deitch, an accomplished drummer and graduate of the Berklee School of Music, was making his second stop at Mr. Small’s in two weeks; he was here with funk outfit Lettuce on Oct. 22.
Break Science’s live show combines producing and keyboards from Lee with drums from Deitch. The addition of the live drums gives their sound much more weight than that of many other electronic producers, and injects their performances with a powerful energy. Possibly nowhere was this more apparent than on the duo’s opening song, the lumbering “Forest of Illumination” off of their 2012 Monolith Code EP. From amidst an ocean of ethereal voices and bright keys, Deitch’s steady smack of the snare drum broke through, signaling that the night was off and running.
Deitch was mesmerizing to watch, seeing as he’s a player who treats the drums as a lead instrument. He employed a diverse spectrum of beats and drumming techniques, hitting every piece of his immense kit at least once during every song. Lee did what he could from behind the laptops and keyboards, jumping up and down and mouthing along to the samples.
The group touched on a number of their high-energy bangers during the show, including an energetic main-set closer of “Who Got It” from their 2013 album Seven Bridges and their recent viral smash “Vibe Walk,” a mash-up of “B*tch Don’t Kill My Vibe” by Kendrick Lamar and Tycho’s “A Walk.”
The Thursday night turnout was small — there appeared to be perhaps 100 people in attendance — but the group did not act like it. New material was premiered and familiar tunes, such as “Now You Want More,” were given new life with extended jam sessions — which is exciting, seeing as improvisation wasn’t a feature of the Break Science live show up until now.
Last Thursday’s show was part of the 18-date “Break Thru” tour, which features electro-soul producer Manic Focus and psychic trap artist Space Jesus as openers. The addition of Manic Focus is particularly noteworthy, seeing as he and Break Science have been working on a collaborative project titled “Manic Science.” The project has thus spawned one single, “You Gotta Move,” and a full-length is reportedly in the works. Attendees to Thursday’s show, and likely those to many other stops on the tour, were given a peek at what is in the works when Manic Focus was brought on stage for the last few songs. The group tore through a host of unreleased material, including an energetic remix of Pretty Lights’ “I Can See It In Your Face” and a powerful mash-up and cover of Busta Rhymes’s “Got You in Check” and 50 Cent’s “In Da Club.” Manic Focus especially seemed to be enjoying every minute of it, grooving and twisting behind the decks like an excited fan.

Have you ever thought that the work of Pulitzer-prize winning novelist Cormac McCarthy, which includes such highly-lauded works as Blood Meridian, The Road, and All the Pretty Horses, was missing something? Perhaps quotation marks? Perhaps more sex? Perhaps, bird sex? If you said yes to any of these, then Mike Tyson Mysteries is the show you’ve been waiting for. The new Adult Swim show, styled after Scooby-Doo and other cartoons of the late 1960s, features a surprisingly all-star voice cast of Mike Tyson as Mike Tyson, Norm MacDonald as an alcoholic pigeon, Rachel Ramras as Tyson’s adopted daughter Yung Hee, and Jim Rash as the ghost of the ninth Marquess of Queensberry. (Yes, this article has been fact-checked.)
The premise of Mike Tyson Mysteries is simple enough. Tyson, known for his hard-partying and hard-punching ways, has decided to lower his fists to help the world by solving mysteries. He receives pleas for help via a fleet of carrier pigeons he keeps stored in a shed behind his pool, and his team of companions head out in their truck to crack the case.
The supporting cast of unique characters is one of the best parts of the show. The Pigeon was once a man, but was turned into a pigeon by his ex-wife. He spews venomous insults and sarcastic comments constantly, with a drink perpetually clutched in his wing. Yung Hee, Tyson’s adopted daughter, was left on Tyson’s doorstep as a baby and is a typical over-achieving young woman who constantly bugs Tyson about looking at colleges. Tyson credits his reformed life to Yung Hee, who he claims spoke to him the day he found her on the front steps. But the credit for that actually goes to the Marquess, an egotistical and neurotic ghost.
Despite the harebrained concept, it appears from the first two episodes of Mike Tyson Mysteries that the show is aimed at a much more diverse demographic than one would expect.
The first episode, “The End,” had the Tyson crew answering a plea from a blocked Cormac McCarthy to help finish his novel. The team arrives to aid the struggling author, only to find that a chupacabra is lurking in the night, sucking the blood out of McCarthy’s horses. The show abounds with specific and — if you get them — hilarious literary jokes. In one memorable scene, Pigeon struggles to find an erotic sequence to pleasure himself to while reading the McCarthy draft, “It’s nothing but cowboys talking to other cowboys. McCarthy’s a prude; he’s no John Updike! I like those John Updike women. Those middle-aged, tan gals.”
One of the more hilarious aspects of the show is the horrible quality of Tyson’s voice acting. He sounds incredibly awkward, and the things the writers have him say only work to highlight it. In response to learning of McCarthy’s reclusive nature, Tyson lisps his way through, “Did his face burn off in a fire, and he had a messed up face, and now he’s afraid of his face?” It’s always amusing to see celebrities parody themselves, and Mike Tyson Mysteries takes it to a whole new level merely because of how horrible an actor Tyson is.
Episode two, “Ultimate Judgment Day,” sees Yung Hee participating in a chess competition, orchestrated by an evil Thomas Watson, against “Deep Blue,” an IBM supercomputer, and Tyson punching out chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov because he assumes him to be the grandmaster of the Ku Klux Klan. There’s a great scene involving a cryogenically frozen Bobby Fischer, but I’ll let you find out about that one for yourself.
Overall, it’s hard to say how I feel about Mike Tyson Mysteries. It exists in a Twilight Zone — it makes no sense, yet it also makes perfect sense. It has all the facets of a dumb-brain comedy, yet surprises with clever plot elements and highbrow references. If you’re at all intrigued, tune in to Adult Swim on Mondays at 10:30 p.m., and remember the words to that famous old song: “Ain’t got no time for bird sex, I wanna fly!”

Warning: This article contains spoilers for Fool for Love.
The stage is dark as a mysterious figure (junior musical theatre major Nick Sacks) dressed in all black paces the stage slowly. No context is given as the lights are turned on to reveal a defunct motel room in the middle of Nowhere, U.S.A. The School of Drama’s production of Fool For Love, which ran in the Phillip Chosky Theater from Nov. 5th through Nov. 7th certainly brought the location to life. The production designers really went to town on that set. If you don’t get the impression that the hotel room is dilapidated, then you are clinically blind. Go see a doctor.
The play opens up with May (junior acting major Kelsey Tarantino), a chef barely making ends meet, clinging to Eddie (junior acting major Casey Cott), a confident Hollywood stuntman, in desperation barely saying a word. Then like a short-circuited switch, she flips. She starts berating him about his alleged fling with “The Countess,” assumedly another Hollywood type that he met while away working in Hollywood. This fling is a point of contention, since May and Eddie had made a pact. A pact for what? I don’t know. There was a lot to be inferred in this play. The pact was probably to stay faithful to one another in some way, though the jury is still out as to whether he slept with her or actually only went on the two dates he alleged they went on. Eddie promised that “The Countess” meant nothing and it was May who was always on his mind.
Eddie then tries to convince May to live with him in a trailer in Wyoming. But that is automatically shut down because May says she would get bored. Still a little irked by Eddie’s public flirtation with “The Countess,” May reveals that she has been seeing another “man.” Not a guy, but a man. And because May did not call him a “guy,” Eddie remains unfazed and still believes that she is in love with him. To Eddie, “guy” signals an actual attraction and “man” signals mere respect. Eddie leaves to get a gun and some alcohol from his car. He cleans his gun and guzzles the alcohol when he comes back in the room — an indication that Eddie is still slightly insecure and feels threatened by this other “man” and that she actually has moved on.
At this point in the play, the mysterious man reappears; only this time, he interacts with Eddie and Eddie acknowledges him. They have a drink and the man throws his hat at him. So who is this guy? What is he? Usually, ghosts are portrayed in this way, but why is he able to make contact with the physical world? He seems like he is a family member or a good friend. The audience can tell there is some history between them, but his purpose is still unknown at this point.
The next sequence of events is a series of slammed doors, yelling matches, and returned departures. Eddie continues to lean and slouch his way across the set, as May is constantly on the defense with a tense and stiff disposition and the quintessential damsel in distress southern accent.
This sequence is suddenly interrupted when a pair of headlights flashes through the window. Eddie assumes it’s the “man” that May has been seeing, but suddenly ducks down when he sees the car. May then runs to the window and sees it’s a black limo Mercedes-Benz, a car belonging to The Countess. Eddie shuts the lights off and ducks down as bullet shots are fired. It clearly did not end well for these two. Eddie and May stay piled on one another until Eddie believes The Countess is gone. He turns the lights back on and looks out the window to see that his windshield and the horse hitch on the back of his truck are completely destroyed, though Eddie seems to not be as mad as he should. It appears that he might have expected something like this to happen.
This scene sparks another fight in which Eddie and May go back and forth internally asking them why they are so drawn to one another. They are always fighting, but they can’t be without one another. It’s a volatile relationship to say the least.
Enter the “man,” Martin (junior acting major Sam McInerney), who with looks alone is completely different from Eddie. Eddie wears a white tank top, worn-in jeans, a denim jacket, a cowboy hat, and cowboy boots with spurs. Martin has perfectly coifed hair, is clean-shaven, and wears a track jacket, sneakers, and a plaid button down tucked into his khaki cargo pants. Martin is a square while Eddie is a wrinkled circle. Instantaneously, Eddie assesses Martin and is reassured of his place. Eddie knows that May will never be happy with Martin, and for most of the scenes Martin and Eddie have together, Eddie rests on the floor unconcerned. To Eddie, when someone is standing, it indicates tension. So now that he believes Martin poses no threat, he is relieved and practically glued to the floor.
As May joins the mix, so does the mysterious man. He starts telling a story that seems to captivate both May and Eddie, but Martin is completely oblivious. He goes through this long speech, which ultimately concludes with the reveal that the mysterious man is both May and Eddie’s father. Twist à la August: Osage County and cue an audible gasp from the audience. It’s clear now that the mysterious figure is not a ghost nor a spirit, but the manifestation of an absentee father.
May and Eddie, at this point, are forced to confront their feelings. Safe to say, the two of them are not completely comfortable with that reality. They realize at this point that their relationship is not safe. Eddie says he is briefly going out to his car and will be back, but May knows better. Eddie is gone for good. And in an action that totally befuddles me, May follows him out the door with suitcase in hand. The ending was completely beyond me, yet I found it very profound and compelling.
Sam Shepard wrote Fool for Love as part of the “dirty realism” literary movement. It is more than just a love story, it is an in-depth study of the effect of hidden motives and the subconscious. Tarantino and Cott fantastically communicated that in their performances. They both disappeared into their role to represent the minutiae of a relationship. I often forgot that the actors and the characters were two separate people. The costumes in part had to do with the transformation. Dressing Eddie in an over-the-top cowboy outfit and May in a slinky satin nightgown established the characters quite quickly and let the audience pay attention to the dialogue, rather than the costumes. Overall, this play had good direction, production design, costumes, and acting. Next time Fool for Love comes to the Purnell stage, I greatly encourage you to go watch.

It’s a 12-hour flight from the Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv to New York City, and from there, it’s at least a seven-hour car ride until you see the sun rise over the three rivers and 90 neighborhoods that make up the city of Pittsburgh. Nearly 6,000 miles away from the lands of their parents and grandparents, it is here that Chay Machluf and Hadeel Salameh are students on the campuses of Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, respectively.
They go about their days just as you do: studying, sitting through hours of class, relaxing with their friends, and participating in campus culture. Nothing sets them apart from anyone else — nothing, that is, except for their unique perspectives that make the news that we read every morning much more real.
I wanted to seek out voices that know firsthand what this polarizing Palestinian-Israeli conflict looks like, especially given that it has received so much attention in Pittsburgh after Conflict Kitchen sparked controversy with its Palestinian menu. I wanted to seek out student voices to describe the view from the ground. Israeli and Palestinian respectively, Machluf and Salameh sat down with The Tartan to give us a glimpse into their worlds and how their experiences can inform a campus.
Chay Machluf
Machluf is a junior exchange student from Technion Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, Israel, studying electrical engineering and physics at Carnegie Mellon University for a semester. He’s tall, with thick dark hair, glasses, and a sense of intense intelligence.
At age 25, he’s older than most juniors, whether they’re from India, Japan, or the United States.
He’s not 20 going on 21 like the rest of us because when he graduated from high school, he spent the next three years in the Israeli Defense Force, like every other man over the age of 18 living in Israel. He worked with engineers during his term, and through that experience, was exposed to what would become his passion: electrical engineering.
“I love the concept of engineering as an idea: to acknowledge a product and turn it into something useful,” Machluf said. “I didn’t want to do mechanical engineering because it’s literally just the reinvention of the wheel. I want to be in unexplored territory.”
Machluf was drawn to Carnegie Mellon from Jerusalem, his hometown, which he calls “a very diverse place with lots of people from all over the world.” It’s hard for him to live in the present moment here in Pittsburgh, though, knowing that back in Jerusalem, his family remains in the midst of the conflict. “I know that the situation back home, in Jerusalem, isn’t the best. It makes me sad to know that my little sister is hesitant to use public transportation because of the fact that rocks are being thrown at it. It’s difficult not to be there for my family, to be unsure as to whether or not everyone is safe and out of harm’s way,” Machluf said.
Though he was initially worried about the culture shock that he would experience as an Israeli living in the United States for an extended period of time, Machluf has found that life isn’t that different at an American university compared to an Israeli one, despite what consumers of the sensationalized media coverage of his home country might think.
“I have a similar mindset to many of the people here. I’ve been able to connect with people who are as passionate as I am. The professors speak the same language as me: science.”
Part of what’s made the transition easy for him, he says, is the incredible Jewish community in Pittsburgh. “It’s been refreshing to be away from the tension and stress. It’s one of those things you don’t realize you deal with every day until you’re removed from them. I miss home, but Pittsburgh has been wonderful to me —  I really feel like I’ve been welcomed by the community and the people,” he said.
But, all the same, there are still stark, noticeable differences.
“The media here is very different from in Israel, which is understandable. Sometimes, I feel like information about foreign events is shut out and all the information isn’t given, and everyone just reacts in the way that they do based on what they believe and their opinions,” Machluf said.
He stressed that despite the heresy, he “doesn’t necessarily agree with the actions of my government. 
“No one agrees with them all the time regardless of where in the world, but the one thing I do know is that violence only leads to more violence — it hardly ever gets you the result you want. Just last week, a man was killed and several others were hurt when a terrorist ran them over with his car. Some of the papers only reported that the police shot and killed an Arab man, disregarding the reason for the action — neutralizing a terrorist.... There are so many versions of what’s going on. I don’t really think these [Americanized media versions] can be accurate, really. You can’t, really. It’s always more complicated than it seems.”
Hadeel Salameh
There is a small but flourishing town in Palestine, near the Jordanian border called Bidya. It’s more of a village than a town, with a population of about 8,000 people.
But among those people are the grandparents and countless cousins of University of Pittsburgh senior creative writing major Hadeel Salameh. Salameh travels to Palestine every summer to visit her family, but returns to Somerset, Pa. where she and her family make their home.
“For me, Palestine is the definition of beauty,” she said. “It’s so beautiful because although the people there are so economically poor and living such challenging lives, they’re always so happy, always smiling. The attitude of the people is so upbeat, so resilient all the time.”
Salameh says that when she returns from her trips to Palestine, she takes advantage of her privilege to make a difference. “I always come back, and I’m inspired to make a difference here. There are a lot of people, adults and young adults, there trying to do something about their conditions, but they can’t. They’re too restricted, she said.”
Her eyes light up and her hands gesture swiftly as she describes the plight of her family and friends in Palestine: fighting unreasonable laws that allow a two-year-old to be jailed for 20 years for throwing a rock, protecting a historic and religious landmark, and figuring out how to go to school on a campus that is riddled with rubber bullet attacks and tear gas canisters.
She stresses, however, that this conflict is just a small part of her identity as a Palestinian-American. “For years, I’ve struggled with my identity and my culture, what it means for me to be a Palestinian-American one generation removed. But it gives me a nice perspective,” Salameh said.
On campus, she serves as the president of Pitt Students for Justice in Palestine, an organization that promotes awareness of the disparity of justice in that area of the world. They work to hold events on campus that focus not on from where someone comes, but rather how people of different backgrounds can work together to achieve peace.
“People are always asking me what I think of Israelis. And I tell them that what I think of them is what I think of Americans, of Palestinians. They’re all people,” Salameh said. “It has nothing to do with people.... Palestinians and Israelis, for the most part, do not hate each other. It’s a political fight about land and expansion.”
Salameh is working on a novel about Palestine, and says that she wants to stress to the world that Palestinians are just people who want what everyone wants: security, happiness, and opportunity. “Sometimes, politics get in the way of us realizing that.”
Editor’s note: These two stories are part of a series focusing on members of the campus and the community who have a unique perspective on current events.

“A thing is a thing. Not what is said about that thing.” 
Such is the underlying mantra that carries the absurdly cacophonic dark comedy Birdman. It follows washed-up movie star Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) as he tries to restart his ailing career by directing, writing, and starring in a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver’s short story “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.” Thomson, in particular, is trying to recover from his decision to walk away from his career-making “Birdman” superhero franchise. After a trilogy, he decides to walk away from his iconic superhero character, the one responsible for his initial superstardom and now bruised ego. Still attached to the power Birdman once gave him, he finds connection to the real world through his “telekenetic powers.” Whether the powers are real or not is somewhat irrelevant. What matters most is the major question that challenges us as the audience; to wonder how far ego can serve Riggin, and people in general, to achieve true self-fulfillment. When does ego inhibit Riggin’s ability to function as an artist, and a human being, in the “real world”?
It’s dubious at best that director Alejandro González Iñárritu would randomly select Keaton, an actor notable for his work in the Batman films of the late ’80s and early ’90s, as the main character struggling with the balance between maintaining artistic integrity as an actor, and Hollywood celebrity. Fellow actor Edward Norton, who played the Hulk in the 2008 reprisal, also supports this intriguing theme of commercial versus artistic sense. Does the importance of cultural relevancy trump the need to validate oneself as an artist? Riggin certainly struggles with this question nearly to the point of mania, in which the actual voice and persona of Birdman haunt and taunt him for his subsequent failures as an actor. Even if he is a mediocre performer, does the success of Birdman substitute for any personal failures Riggan suffers?
There is one particular scene which is possibly the most bitter yet liberating part of the film, in which Riggan actually confronts his trepidation as an artist when he tries to woo the favor of renowned New York Times theatre critic Tabitha Dickinson (Lindsey Duncan). One review from her could singlehandedly make or break Riggan’s play. When he tries to tell her about how he wanted to become an actor, she cruelly shuts him down, telling him that no matter what, she will write the worst review ever. To Tabitha, Riggan represents an entitled Hollywood elite who uses their commercial success to stomp over the genuinely creative minds that are undeservedly forced into the backburner of anonymity. She feels it her responsibility to put a stop to this commercial takeover in the once dignified realm of theatre. In what could be a moment of complete disheartenment for Riggan, he turns the tables on Tabitha, saying that her critical reviews are simply an excuse to sugarcoat her uninformed conceptions of celebrity versus artist. To Riggan, Tabitha is dismissing the fact that Riggan is putting his entire life into this play, thus ignoring the noble artistic sensibility that Tabitha claims she wants to uphold. She doesn’t admit he is wrong, but is still intent on destroying his career. Both characters strive for artistic integrity, but their skewed ideas of what counts as integrity are what keeps the segregation of commercial versus artistic success alive and well.
The film is a triumphant work that reinvents and reboots the rather lackluster and monotonous genre of comedy existing in American theaters today. Most comedy films today are filled with farcical, one-dimensional comedic breaks filling in for the otherwise lazy filmmaking. It is assumed that comedy is only about telling jokes, filmed statically, which offers no development within the dynamic of a film.
Birdman, however, blazes through the comedy genre with a no-nonsense sense of momentum that is magnetically driven by the pacing of the film. It not only expects the audience to catch up with the story, but challenges them to dive into the absurdity of this journey. This is demonstrated especially through the compelling wizardry of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (he served as the cinematographer for a little film called Gravity), who collaborates with Iñárritu to edit the film as one continuous take. It’s nothing short of unbelievable — the amount of thought that goes into crafting a film that appears to be one 122-minute tracking shot. There are none of the cutaways or clear transitions between scenes that we are so used to to help us distinguish the structure of a story. It engages the audience with its seamlessness, almost to the point where it is exhausting. One moment blends into the next with no clear exposition or time for us to stitch scenes together. The camera use is meant to communicate that the story moves along the same way time does. Again, the film is draining due to its devotion to being a filmic reincarnation of time, but it’s ultimately rewarding in its fearlessness in depicting the absurdity of life (even if it’s through its own outlandishly experimental ways).

I’ve read a lot of fashion magazines in my time, and changing one’s personal style seems to be a very common concern. Many people feel as if they’re stuck in a rut with their style and want to change it. But it’s not always easy to know where to start. Keep reading for a few tips on reinventing your wardrobe.
A great way to reinvent your style is to go to clothing stores where you normally would not shop  or that you’ve never entered. There might be that one store at the mall where you’ve always wanted to try the clothes but thought against it, thinking you wouldn’t like anything anyway. The same goes with online shopping. Looking through the same websites can get boring after a while, so look up stores that are similar to the ones you like. Though this may seem counterintuitive if the goal is to reinvent your style, even stores that are similar do not cater to exactly the same style, and there’s a chance you’ll find some interesting and unique pieces.
If you can’t find what you’re looking for at a new store, find a style icon for whatever look you’re trying to achieve. Usually this is a celebrity, not only because a lot of people try to emulate their style, but also because celebrities usually have stylists who pick certain pieces that convey a specific look. As a result, most people are aware of an outfit that Blake Lively would wear or what kind of style Taylor Swift has. Looking into outfits that are commonly worn by a celebrity whose style really inspires you, or is reminiscent of the style that you are trying to emulate, can be incredibly helpful. Even if you’re not sure how to change your style but know that you need a change, finding one or a few celebrities whose styles you like and blending those together can be a great way to reinvent yourself.
Once you’ve gotten an idea of what you would like to change your personal style to, based on what you’ve recently been liking in stores and which celebrities’ styles you enjoy, you can begin building your wardrobe around a few new pieces in the process of reinventing the way you dress. The wrong thing to do would be to go out and buy a million pieces that stereotypically fit under one genre. Not only would this confine you to one style that may or may not represent you, but it could also end up looking outlandish. Instead, the better option is to pick two to three pieces that would work well with your current wardrobe but are still different from the things you currently own. Mixing different styles is always a good thing, especially if the result is unique.
The last part of reinventing your style is getting rid of clothing items that you might have loved a few years ago. It’s possible that you still wear a clothing item out of habit, but if you are trying to reinvent and redefine your personal style, then the best option is to remove old clothing from your closet. Being somewhat of a hoarder myself, I understand that it’s difficult to part from clothing items you’ve had for a long time, but for this purpose, it is necessary.
Reinventing your style is definitely easier said than done. It’s a long process, since most people don’t (and shouldn’t) go and buy several items of a specific style that they may or may not like later. The most important part of it is making sure you pick things that you actually like and that you believe would represent you well.

Dear Evan,
We’re taking a really, really hard test in the Adamson Wing, and right now the only thing harder than formulating this essay question response is keeping myself from pissing my pants — seriously, I really have to go to the bathroom. If I get up to leave, though, I’ll have to run all the way to the back of the lecture hall and up two flights to the second floor, since the men’s bathroom on the first floor of Baker flooded yesterday when someone tried to flush a bottle of Riesling wine (the actual bottle).
If I tried to go, I wouldn’t get back to the test on time to finish it, but I’m having a little trouble focusing, so I need to figure this out right now. 
To pee, or not to pee?
Anxiously,
I Truly Shouldn’t Have had A Mocha Latte, Especially Two, Too Immediately, Making me Edgy
Dear IT’S HAMLET TIME,
I feel the need to point out the obvious here: You don’t really have time to read my response, do you? For you, you either piss your pants and finish your test, or relieve yourself and get … what, a B? I really don’t see an issue here. 
But, since you’re probably one of those people who can’t stand to get anything less than an A on anything, and since I’m a childish person, let’s talk about peeing.
Pissing your pants seems like the absolute worst option here. You’ll end up having to walk around like that all day, unless you brought a change of pants (just in case this happened?) or you run to the student store after the test to buy some cardinal red, Carnegie Mellon-emblazoned sweatpants (only $23.99!). And depending on where you are in the room and how long class has been going, pretty soon everyone in class is going to smell it. Smells travel fast in that room. Trust me.
But if you really want every possible moment you’ve been allowed to finish this test, I suggest that, if you’re sitting next to someone you dislike or don’t know, you discreetly piss on him or her. Not only do you not have to go anywhere and avoid soiling yourself, but if they’re a particularly good student, you get to screw up the curve, too.
But really, just go to the bathroom,
Evan Kahn

A new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie has been a popular notion for a while. But when Michael Bay volunteers to produce it, you are sort of inclined to accept. I am sure that if you are a fanboy/girl, you will have some qualms with the movie — but that’s life when you live in a world where Hollywood wants everything to have three sequels and a remake. Since it has been seven years since the last Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, TMNT, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles does start out with the origin story all over again. The premise is as follows: April O’Neil (Megan Fox) wants to branch out from being a lifestyle reporter, into a hard-hitting news journalist. Nobody really believes she can do it until she sees a pack of vigilante teenage human-size turtles with ninja fighting skills attacking members of the current street gang. So instead of wondering, “who slipped hallucinogens in my lip gloss?” she chases them down. And as they say, the rest is history. Essentially, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a children’s cartoon turned blockbuster that is inappropriate for anyone under the age of twelve.

Conflict Kitchen, a restaurant in Oakland that serves food from nations with which the U.S. is in conflict, announced last Friday that it is closed until further notice after receiving a letter containing death threats.
“We have received a letter today containing death threats and we will be closed until the credibility of the letter can be established by the Pittsburgh police. We hope to reopen shortly,” the restaurant posted to its Facebook page.
Conflict Kitchen, located in Schenley Plaza, stirred up controversy when the restaurant began serving Palestinian food last month. The restaurant has been criticized by pro-Israel groups in Pittsburgh — including Carnegie Mellon's Tartans 4 Israel — for what some claim is an anti-Israel bias. Much of the criticism has been directed toward pamphlets handed out with the restaurant’s food, which are filled with interviews from Palestinians living both in the U.S. and in the West Bank and Gaza.
“Like we have done for four years with every other country of focus, our food wrappers contain the viewpoints of multiple people within our focus country on a wide variety of topics,” Conflict Kitchen posted on its website in response to coverage by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “The interviews were done by us personally with Palestinians in Palestine, and in our own city. The thoughts and opinions that come through the interviews are informed by their personal context, experiences and histories as Palestinians.”
The Heinz Endowment disavowed a $50,000 grant, given to Conflict Kitchen in April 2013, after urging from B’nai B’rith International, an organization dedicated to promoting the international Jewish community and human rights, according to its website.
The creators of Conflict Kitchen, Professor of Art Jon Rubin and Dawn Weleski (CFA ’10), could not be reached for comment.

During the rapid expansion of Carnegie Mellon University that has taken place over the past 10 years, the area surrounding the school has changed, including Craig Street. The face of Craig Street has evolved with the area around it, impacting both the business owners and the students who frequent the South Craig Street stretch to satisfy their coffee and bubble tea cravings.
Just this past month, in the official groundbreaking of the Jared L. Cohon University Center expansion, district city councilman and alumnus Dan Gilman (DC ‘04) commented on the overall campus expansion plan: “[Carnegie Mellon] is embracing Forbes Avenue; we’re giving a new face to the future of Forbes, which will add definition to campus.” The plan highlighted CMU’s interests in its community beyond campus, and Craig Street is certainly an important part of it.
As of 2014, the university owns properties on Craig Street, including the University Police headquarters, 300 Craig Street (the building that contains Razzy Fresh), and 407 Craig Street. “We have been very excited by the energy and enthusiasm of the businesses on Craig Street to embrace the campus community, and especially our students,” Michael Murphy, vice president for campus affairs, said in an email to The Tartan. “The university owns and leases a fair amount of property in and around Craig, some of which is used for university functions and some of which is residential. It is important for the street to have a mix of businesses and activities that appeal to students. The quality of life for CMU students will only be enhanced by a stronger, more vibrant Craig Street district, which can only be accomplished if all the constituencies work together.”
The university has put together multiple committees and focus groups to drive the vision for Craig Street and the surrounding area. One such committee is the Craig Street Corridor Committee, comprised of students, faculty members, and administrators, according to fourth-year architecture student and Undergraduate Student Senate campus life committee chair Nikhil Sambamurthy. Sambamurthy said the committee has spent a lot of time reflecting on the Craig Street Crawl, which took place at the tail end of Orientation, and focused on looking to create another event this semester or in the spring.
“The Craig Street corridor is increasingly central to the life of the campus, adding vitality to the whole of the Carnegie Mellon experience,” Murphy said.
To that end, the university has acquired a number of plots of land, both along Forbes Ave. and on S. Craig Street. In 2009, the university announced in a press release that it had purchased “three nearby Forbes Avenue properties, including the former site of an Exxon service station at 4621 Forbes, from Museum Park Partners, a land development firm, for future development in the Forbes Avenue and Craig Street corridors. In addition to the former service station, the purchase includes a hillside just east of 4621 and a house on Filmore Street, which sits behind 4621.”
According to the press release, prior to the acquisition, the university had also purchased three acres of land on Forbes and three separate properties, which at that time “housed a bar, vintage clothing shop, and restaurant.” The purchases, which have been adding up since that press release was published, have all been repurposed for the university’s use, either through office space or renting out to retailers, according to both Murphy and Justin Miller, a senior city planner in the Department of City Planning who works specifically with the Craig Street neighborhood. The area that makes up what is colloquially known as Craig Street is actually just the southern end of the street, which, according to the department of city planning, is classified as a public realm.
“Public realms are intended to provide a development framework for areas of the city that have a regional significance that don’t really meet the basic requirements of our basic zoning districts (for example, residential or commercial) ... and have their own unique set of guidelines. It’s unique. It’s not a standard business district,” Miller said.
According to Miller, a public realm differs from a typical zoning district in the regulation categories, for example, for height and setback, and in the standards that the city planning committee uses to approve projects. “It has to be sensitive to the nature of the public space.... The committee will evaluate the project for how well they think it fits in with the public space,” Miler said.
Though most of the property owned by Carnegie Mellon falls under the zoning classification of EMI (educational/medical institution), the properties that the school has purchased on Craig Street remain public realm.
According to Miller, unless the university chooses to petition to change it, there is generally little cause for re-zoning, leaving the newly acquired Craig Street properties under the looser guidelines of the public realm. “It’s up to the university in that case to decide whether or not they want to go through that process and then they would follow the same process as anyone else,” Miller said.
Business owners on Craig Street questioned the benefits of having the university expand into their territory in 2009 letters to the ex-Mayor Luke Ravenstahl and Councilman Bill Peduto cited by Trib Total Media, but campus town halls and the master plan have indicated otherwise.
The 2012 master plan that the university released to the community and to the campus outlined the plans that the university has to expand its borders, primarily into the Craig Street Corridor. And, according to Miller, as long as this statement of intent is present in the master plan and accounted for at the city planner’s office, the university is within their rights to build up and out. And build out it plans to.
“I am very pleased by the energy and focus on the ‘campus sphere’ beyond the footprint of the campus. We are in such a special location — with the park, golf course, great neighborhoods, museum, University of Pittsburgh and more — it is a terrific environment and we will continue to partner with others for even increasing vitality throughout this region,” Murphy said.

While America went right, Pennsylvania went left.
A frustrated America booted Democrats from both the U.S. Congress and a majority of state governments during midterm elections last week, with Republicans now controlling the House and Senate for the last two years of President Barack Obama’s final term.
Yet this past Tuesday, Pennsylvanians chose Democrat Tom Wolf as the state’s new governor. Wolf ousted Republican Governor Tom Corbett in a historic election, making Corbett the first governor not re-elected in the history of the Keystone State since Pennsylvania allowed governors to run for consecutive terms. The Carnegie Mellon community contributed a respectable amount of votes in the midterm elections, joining Pennsylvania’s higher-than-expected voter turnout.
“We need to reestablish education as the priority,” stated Wolf at his victory rally in York, Pa.
A businessman from central Pennsylvania, Wolf defeated Corbett as approval ratings for the incumbent governor continued to drop.
For Wolf, the state’s public education system demands the most attention. Since the start of Corbett’s term as governor, the highly contested state education budget cuts incited a bold backlash from voters across the state. As stated by the University of Pittsburgh’s website, the state’s handling of the education budget has been a challenge for the school: “Pitt trustees have approved a $1.97 billion operating budget for the fiscal year that began on July 1, 2014. The University’s state funding remains at the same level as it was in 1995, in absolute dollars unadjusted for inflation. If inflationary adjustments are made, state support now is at its lowest level since Pitt became a public university in the mid-1960s.”
Corbett’s loss is a sharp contrast to the overwhelmingly successful elections of Republicans in state and federal governments in this midterm election. Corbett’s miscommunications with the public concerning the education budget cuts, among other issues, are recognized as the main reasons for his loss. Perhaps Corbett will be best remembered for permitting the legalization of gay marriage in Pennsylvania.
Wolf has never held public office before now. Previously, he directed his family’s building supplies company outside of Harrisburg for three decades. He received a doctorate in political science from MIT, and served with the Peace Corps in India. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Wolf spent $10 million dollars of his own money on his campaign, a significantly higher amount than that spent by his far more politically-experienced rivals. Wolf’s most aggressive campaigns against Corbett concerned the controversial education budget cuts.
Although Carnegie Mellon does not have a large number of enrolled students from Pennsylvania, voting turnout at the school proved solid. Four voting booths were set up on Tuesday in the CUC’s alumni lounge under the supervision of the Center and Allegheny County. 241 persons voted in the Pennsylvania elections at Carnegie Mellon. Another seven absentee ballots were counted, meaning seven persons voted in the elections from outside of the state.
According to Marcia Gerwig, the Director of the Cohon University Center, the voting system at Carnegie Mellon underwent changes to become more convenient for the community. Originally polling booths were positioned at the former Skibo building, with the booths relocated to the nearby city golf course during construction of the CUC. In 2008, student body requests for closer voting locations moved the booths back to campus.
The majority of Carnegie Mellon students hail from outside of the state, and 20 percent of students come from places outside of the United States. Still, Wolf’s administration will have an effect on Carnegie Mellon. His goals, he said after he was elected, are “to fund a world-class public education system, create family-sustaining jobs ... build safe communities, and keep Pennsylvania beautiful.”
Sophomore Casey Devine, a global studies major and Pittsburgh native, shared her thoughts on the race: “I followed the election and I did vote.... I think [Wolf] has a lot to offer. He is truly progressive in terms of women’s issues, the environment, and marriage equality and education, but I do think that he will be very challenged by the fact that he is facing a heavily Republican legislature.”
Also an undergraduate from Pittsburgh, sophomore computer science and English major Steve Epple voiced his concerns about the election. “You caught me. I didn’t vote. It is my eternal shame,” joked Epple. “That is not to say that I found Tom Wolf to be a particularly strong candidate. I was disappointed that he did not address the elephant in the room, the UPMC/Highmark split, during his campaign. I am also concerned about how he is going to handle education in Pennsylvania. While I believe investing in education to be of utmost importance, I am concerned by Wolf’s eagerness to reinstate Corbett’s cuts to the education system. I think the education system needs to be drastically reorganized before risking more money in an already struggling system... I appreciated his environmental platform and support his position on taxing natural gas manufacturing.”

Carnegie Mellon housing is planning some large changes to their current system: moving up the housing selection timeline, and launching a rebranding campaign to attract students to stay in on-campus housing.
Housing and Dining Services confirmed by email that online housing selection will be available on Feb. 15, and the deadline for general room selection will be noon on Feb. 26, with the specific dates for the various phases of room selection occurring throughout February and March.
Director of Marketing for Student Affairs Mandi Semple explained that “the thinking behind it was that students are already thinking about where to live in the next year when they get back from winter break,” continuing, “students will be completely done with housing selection by spring break.”
Semple spoke of how busy the second half of the spring semester can be for students, between exams and Carnival, saying, “from a student perspective, this is supposed to make life easier.”
Semple explained that Housing had benchmarked its calendar with those at other universities, some of which begin their housing selection as early as January. “We’re now more on par with other institutions,” she said.
As a result of this shift in the housing calendar, the selection for resident assistants (RAs) and community advisors (CAs) will also happen earlier. 
Director of Upperclass and Greek Student Life Lucas Christain confirmed that applications for RAs and CAs will open Nov. 24, and that the CA selection process will conclude the week of Jan. 12. RA selection will conclude the week of Feb. 9.
Additionally, the selection process for “themed housing,” which was previously called special interest housing and includes Wellness Living in Henderson House, Global Living in Clyde House, and the Sustainability House in Margaret Morrison Apartments will be slated to begin Jan. 26. “This process starts a bit earlier to ensure that the students who apply for themed housing will still be able to participate in the general room selection process if they are not offered a space in the themed living community for which they apply,” Christain explained.
These overall changes are part of Housing Services’s overall effort to rebrand itself, which, as Semple explained, “is part of the university’s strategic plan.”
Addressing factors such as infrastructure, financial planning, and marketing to students, Housing Services is drafting and considering revisions to housing facilities, rate structures, websites, and social media.
“There will be some time before the end of the academic year [when] students can see and provide feedback on [these changes],” Semple said. “Ideas will be brought to students, focus groups, and the student dormitory council,” in a fashion similar to what Dining Services currently does.
Christain summarized the rebranding effort, saying “there is an intentional push to increase marketing and awareness of what housing has to offer our students.”

Piecemaker, a 3–D printing startup created by Carnegie Mellon master’s student in mechanical engineering Arden Rosenblatt and master’s student in electrical and computer engineering Alejandro Sklar, announced their partnership with retail giant Toys “R” Us at a launch party this Thursday.
Piecemaker brings 3–D printers to retailers and allows customers to design custom pieces on touchscreen kiosks — ranging from small plastic toys to pendants — and watch them be printed in the store.
Rosenblatt and Sklar first introduced the idea of bringing 3–D printing to the public at Project Olympus, Carnegie Mellon’s startup incubator, in 2013.
Kit Needham, entrepreneur in residence at Project Olympus and Piecemaker advisory board member, gave an opening speech at the launch party, discussing the origins of Piecemaker.
“I can always tell when I give presentations, that [the students] I’m getting the most questions from inevitably I do see not too long afterwards, and this was the case with Arden and Alejandro,” Needham said, referring to Rosenblatt and Sklar’s decision to take leaves of absence from Carnegie Mellon to run Piecemaker.
Needham first met with Rosenblatt and Sklar in January of 2013 and worked with the pair to create a focus and direction for Piecemaker the following summer.
“This whole process got us to be more specific, to actually find concrete uses, and to build a whole system around that,” Rosenblatt said. “Kit’s our hero; she’s been here with us since the beginning.”
“[Project Olympus] connected us to a lot of great people” Sklar said. “You get out of it what you put into it, but they have a great network and they will connect you to the right people.”
Don Morrison, chairman of deal flow at BlueTree Allied Angels, and Piecemaker board member, also gave an opening speech at the launch, discussing Piecemaker’s place in the future of retail.
“The only certainty about retail is uncertainty. Whatever it is today is going to be different tomorrow,” Morrison said. “Piecemaker is perfectly positioned to take advantage of the personalization, customization, and the omnichannel opportunities that there are.”
After Morrison, Rosenblatt took the podium to speak of the past successes of Piecemaker and their new partnership with Toys “R” Us.
The concept of the Piecemaker Factory was first launched at the 2014 Toy Fair in New York City, where they garnered attention from over 30 retailers and were named one of the top trending toys of the year by CNBC.
“It was a little bit of a moment of truth for us,” Rosenblatt said. “It was more than just a concept; it was a system that was supposed to be viable, to make money, to be simple, to be fun, to be meaningful.”
The first in-store pilots came soon afterward, in S.W. Randall Toyes and Giftes in downtown Pittsburgh and Squirrel Hill, as well as and Playthings Etc. in Butler, Pa. The pilots were a success, accounting for 5 percent of the stores’ sales in the first month.
These successes led to the startup’s partnership with the largest retailer in the toy industry, Toys “R” Us. The Piecemaker Factories will appear in the Cranberry Township, Pa. and Totowa, N.J. Toys “R” Us stores in late November.
However, Rosenblatt and Sklar have bigger plans for Piecemaker, beyond the realm of toy making. Sklar spoke of expanding into new markets and exploring different materials and technology.
“We don’t want to just be toys. We see a much bigger vision of this,” Sklar said. “We’re not pigeonholing ourselves into just 3–D printing toys. It’s much bigger than that.”
“We really strive at this company to do things that are not just exciting and new, but really peerless and unprecedented,” Rosenblatt said. “We want to keep going bigger, to do things that have never been done, on a scale that they’ve never been done.”

Special Allocation: Pi Kappa Alpha
A motion was discussed on whether to fund Pi Kappa Alpha’s philanthropic Tembo Soccer Tournament for the prevention of drug and alcohol abuse. The organization asked for $1,500 to cover operational costs, but the Finance Committee recommended $600 in funding. According to Senate’s bylaws, Pi Kappa Alpha should be able to fund food and T-shirts on their own. In the past, the organization has raised $11,000 for the Gateway Rehabilitation Center, so funding would prevent them from having to cut into these proceeds to cover operational costs. Discussion concluded that funding operational costs exclusively would be appropriate, and that the Finance Committee’s recommendation would be followed. Additionally, the lack of fiscal transparency by Pi Kappa Alpha was noted, as the organization did not provide an updated budget for three weeks. This financial allocation was approved by a vote.
Policy presentation
Senior information systems major Andrew Schwartz gave a presentation about changes in the Student Body Constitution about Senate’s ability to spend the collected student media fee, unless there is unstructured graduate student money in their account at the beginning of the fiscal year. Additionally, during non-allocation years, the Senate’s executive branch will be able to function in the same capacity as the University Center Allocations Board.

By now we’ve all seen the video “10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman,” which has gone viral over the past few weeks, showing a woman consistently being “catcalled,” or bombarded by unsolicited sexually suggestive comments by strangers, as she walks the streets of New York City.
This video is a dramatic depiction of what women face on a daily basis. However, this video has also sparked substantial controversy, as it features a white woman being harassed by men of color (resulting in allegations that the white male harassers were edited out of the video) as she walks through lower income neighborhoods. It was produced by Rob Bliss Creative, which describes itself as “A Viral Video Marketing Agency.”
These controversies, particularly regarding the race of the catcallers featured in the video, have caused a great deal of discussion and debate. It is important that the criticisms of this video do not eclipse the larger issue at hand: Catcalling is sexual harassment, and it is experienced by women on a regular basis, from men of all colors and walks of life.
Since the widespread recognition of this video, both public and private debates have been held regarding catcalling, the frequency of its occurrence, and the extent to which it constitutes a form of harassment. Some of the more infuriating critics of the video have contended that catcalling is a form of flattery, and that women wouldn’t mind if the men harassing them were attractive. 
After being presented with the fact that women have faced violence in reacting negatively to such harassment, one commentator on CNN even went so far as to suggest that to avoid catcalling women should carry guns.
Catcalling is a problem and affects women every single day. We need to ensure that people are free to go about their daily business free of sexual harassment. 
While “10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman” has done an effective job of starting a larger conversation on this matter, debates over the video’s construction are threatening to eclipse the important discussion that needs to be had: We all need to band together to stop catcalling and sexual harassment in our society.

Carnegie Mellon is embarking on a critically important strategic planning process. This process will set the stage for the evolution and development of Carnegie Mellon both in the next few years and for the next decade. As a member of the Carnegie Mellon community for 45 years, I have witnessed a number of strategic planning events led by former Presidents Cyert, Mehrabian, and Cohon. Each one resulted in significant changes in the direction of Carnegie Mellon, and these have been critical evolutionary steps that have brought the university to its position of prominence today.
As I think back over previous strategic planning initiatives, however, I am struck by the absence of strong direct student involvement. Yet nearly every aspect of the strategic plan will have a direct impact on our student body, and we want to encourage student input in the strongest possible way.
I am writing to encourage broad student participation in this planning process — along with all other members of the campus community. President Subra Suresh has identified three major thrust areas: Transformative Teaching and Learning (led by Richard Scheines, dean of the Dietrich College, and Nathan Urban, interim provost), Transformative Research Creativity, Innovation and Entrepreneurship (led  by Jim Garrett, dean of the College of Engineering and Farnam Jahanian, vice president of research), and the Transformative CMU Experience (led by Ramayya Krishnan, dean of the Heinz College and Michael Murphy, vice president of campus affairs).
I want to encourage all of you to become engaged in this process. There are a number of ways to participate. First, there will be a campus-wide town hall meeting — the first in a series of such meetings — scheduled for Nov. 17 at 4:30 p.m. in the Posner Center, at which many of the thrust leaders will be present to gather campus input. Second, you can contact any of the thrust leaders mentioned above and convey your ideas. Third, you can visit the strategic planning website at www.cmu.edu/strategic-plan, or send an email to strategic-plan@andrew.cmu.edu. Finally, you can discuss ideas within your own student organizations and have those organizations directly engage in the process.
Strategic plans are important and lead to real change. Planning in the Cyert administration resulted in each department narrowing its research agenda to a few areas in which it could be nationally competitive, as well as a concentrated focus on interdisciplinary research and teamwork. This led to the development of signature programs like engineering and public policy.
Under the leadership of President Robert Mehrabian, the strategic plans emphasized the quality of the undergraduate experience. This resulted in the improvement of faculty teaching and advising, and the construction of the Jared L. Cohon University Center as a tangible way to enhance the students’ academic and nonacademic experience.
There were many changes that took place under President Jared Cohon. In my mind, one of the most significant was the strategic decision to strongly develop the university’s capabilities in the biological sciences, even though Carnegie Mellon did not have a medical school. This required a significant investment by the university, and led to the strengthening of the department of biological sciences, the creation of a department of biomedical engineering, and the creation of the Ray and Stephanie Lane Center for Computational Biology, each of which have greatly broadened opportunities for our faculty and students.
President Suresh has been in office for only 16 months, but he has already shown the ability to accelerate new initiatives, such as the Simon Initiative in technology-enhanced learning and BrainHub, which is integrating our many brain science activities across campus while also creating new global academic partnerships. The current strategic planning effort is especially important given our president’s great strengths in creating and executing major initiatives.
The strategic plan will focus on both short-term and long-term directions, and there are many simple and radical ideas that must be explored. For example, should we change the university calendar? Should we institute some sort of winter term for either non-academic and/or academic short courses, service projects etc.? Can we make better use of technology to eliminate many of the large lectures and replace them with smaller, more interactive classes? Is it advisable to increase the course offerings that combine faculty from different colleges, such as the new IDeATe program? Although we have substantial diversity in our undergraduate student body, how can we enhance interaction among the many distinctive groups on campus? Can we bring more of the academic portion of the undergraduate experience into the dorms? What changes can we make to further enhance the student experience?
These are only a few of the areas that the upcoming strategic plan can address, and each would have a significant impact on our students. At this seminal moment in Carnegie Mellon’s history, I call on the entire campus community to engage in the process and have a hand in setting the university’s course for the next decade.

Interim Executive Vice President

Last week, Brittany Maynard died. She had been diagnosed with a stage four glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive form of brain cancer, several months before her death. On Nov. 1, she ended her own life using a mix of sedatives and upper respiratory-system depressants prescribed to her by a doctor under Oregon’s Death with Dignity Act. I’d like to advance a potentially controversial opinion on her decision: It’s nobody’s business but her own.
Maynard chose to bring her illness and her death into the public consciousness in a very deliberate way. She wanted to open up the conversation about medically-driven suicide, and she certainly did. However, I don’t think that her public discussion of her choice to end her life makes that choice any less intensely personal.
After Maynard’s announcement, replies abounded from other people who suffered from terminal forms of cancer, such as Maggie Karner and Kara Tippets. Both Karner and Tippets pleaded with Maynard not to end her own life; Karner argued that Maynard should not deny her family the opportunity to care for her as she died, and Tippets argued that suffering can be a beautiful experience, not something to fear. Nadin Naumann wrote about her mother’s struggles with Maynard’s same disease, and argued that her mother’s decision to try to live as long as possible was the right one, because the experiences that they’d had together outweighed her mother’s suffering.
All of these experiences — all of these choices — are personal.
I don’t think that Naumann’s mother’s experience is comparable to Maynard’s, or Tippets’s, or Karner’s. Each person’s experience with death and dying is unique and, ultimately, private. For Tippets and Karner, dying with dignity means living as long as they can and enduring suffering to be with their loved ones. For Maynard, dying with dignity meant ending her life before her disease robbed her of everything she was.
Maynard had the right to choose the time and place of her own dying. Her glioblastoma was destroying her brain. Maynard would have suffered increasingly violent seizures; her ability to speak, her memories, her personality — all of these essential parts of her would have been profoundly damaged. In one of her interviews with CNN, just after she went public with her decision, Maynard described moments when she would look at her husband and not remember his name. Maynard was going to spend the last months of her life suffering. There is no immorality in wanting to avoid that end. Equally, there is beauty in Tippetts’s and Karner’s respective decisions to live with cancer for as long as they can.
Many of the arguments leveled against Maynard’s decision have relied on the concept that Maynard owes someone something — either her family her presence, God her faith, or the opinions of others her attention. A few enterprising souls even suggested to Maynard that she freeze some of her eggs so her husband could have children without her.
This last suggestion, for me, raises the question of how much Maynard’s gender impacted the way this controversy played out in the public sphere. If Maynard’s husband, Dan Diaz, had been the one diagnosed with brain cancer, there may have been a lot less discussion of him owing anyone anything. Culturally, we have a habit of expecting women to shoulder suffering without complaint or anger. Maynard’s suicide defies this cultural expectation we have of women, which is part of the reason it makes us uncomfortable. But regardless of gender identity, every person’s decision in a case like this — a guarantee of a long, slow decline, followed by a painful death — is achingly personal. In her article, Naumann asked: “How about the friends and family that are affected by their loved one’s diagnosis? Shouldn’t they get a say in this?” In my opinion? No. They shouldn’t.
It’s important to note that in Maynard’s case, her mother and husband did have a say in her decision, and they supported it. But even if they hadn’t, the decision ultimately would have still been Maynard’s alone. The only obligations Brittany Maynard — or anyone, really — had in her final days were to her own self.
Dying from a terminal illness is a messy, painful process. For some people, that experience offers the opportunity for greater personal or religious enlightenment or for closeness with their families. For others, it’s just long, drawn-out suffering. Choosing one of these paths over another is neither courage nor cowardice. Your death will be your business. Brittany Maynard’s was hers.

The recent public discussion surrounding Conflict Kitchen's decision to serve Palestinian food has been lacking, to say the least. Very little ink spilled has been spilled over what the opposition to Conflict Kitchen actually is. While Conflict Kitchen is ultimately justified in serving Palestinian food, the public has a much more important right to adversarial and engaging discourse. 
This discourse is what allows people to cultivate informed opinions and eventually contribute to a more diverse and responsive political environment populated by more views than just “blue” and “red.” Unfortunately, it seems many people who have chosen to back Conflict Kitchen have skipped over that engaging and adversarial bit.
A preponderance of blog posts, including a recent article on Jezebel, have criticized the opposition to Conflict Kitchen. Many have featured a quote from Gregg Roman, Director of the Community Relations Council at the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, stating that "Palestine is not in conflict with the U.S." and "the restaurant is stirring up conflict for the sake of trying to be relevant.” This quote indicates that those in opposition to Conflict Kitchen are struggling to put together real arguments. Though Roman uttered a bizarre sentence, one sentence from one person is a pretty disappointing attempt at capturing the public unrest with Conflict Kitchen. It conjures up conservative images of liberals who talk past those who disagree and pat themselves on the back for being worldly.  
However, it is important that the actual common argument against Conflict Kitchen’s actions that I gathered from conversations with people in Squirrel Hill, even if it fails to survive close scrutiny, gets in print somewhere.
Many of the conversations I have had gave me the general sense that people take issue with the word Palestinian. It is a very common position that the idea of the Palestinian was created to indict Israel. The gist of the argument is that, prior to the escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, Palestinians were largely referred to as Arab refugees — natives of Jordan, Lebanon, and other Middle Eastern nations. The unification of their identities was created to justify the establishment of a Palestinian state where Israel had been implanted by the United Nations. Some people feel, then, that Conflict Kitchen serving Palestinian food is legitimizing an identity constructed to indict Israel.
This argument is not exactly a death knell. The idea itself that Palestinians did not exist before Israel is debatable. However, people have been born in Gaza and the West Bank well after this conflict started and have known no homeland except for Palestine; it clearly is a nationality now, even if it was not before. 
Further, even if it is entirely true that Palestinians only exist to de-legitimize Israel’s claim to the land, the fact that actions in the area have forced people to fundamentally alter their identities is more likely an issue with Israel than with Palestine. 
However, to gloss over it in public discussion of Conflict Kitchen serving Palestinian food defeats the entire purpose of public discourse. The view that conflicts are too complicated for us to understand from afar—and that we should just focus on our shared humanity—helps no one. It’s just a way to convince ourselves that we’re good people while the world burns outside of our peripherals.  
Actually talking about things helps people know the issues, and heated arguments result in both parties understanding the other side’s point of view better. The absolute lack of engagement with arguments surrounding this conflict further entrenches people on both sides of the field. Many people who are against Conflict Kitchen's decision to serve Palestinian food will start to believe that others are in favor of it just because they’re politically ignorant, and many who support it will believe those who disagree with them are knuckle-dragging bigots.
There are plenty of reasons for people to assume that the Jewish community believes the humanization of Palestinians to be anti-Semitic. Many Jews have taken up the pro-Israel cause due to the occasionally blatantly anti-Jewish sentiment that comes out of the anti-Israel media coverage. 
If you don’t think the painting of this conflict as the Israeli military machine gleefully murdering Palestinian children is a not-so-subtle reference to the Jewish media machine and blood libel, you’re kidding yourself. If you think that attacks on temples in Germany and the shooting at the Jewish Museum of Belgium — justified as anti-Israel protests — weren't anti-Semitic, you have superseded kidding yourself and might have some genocidal tendencies.  
People have equated pro-Israeli sentiment with the dehumanization of Palestinians. However, many Jewish people and organizations have said that criticism of Israel’s security policy is not only good, but necessary. Many Jewish people believe that Israel’s politics are a corruption of the Torah, and they want Israel to take a new tack. Even pro-Israel Jews tend to support the view that the Palestinians need a homeland, as long as Israel retains its current borders. 
Humanizing the Palestinian people is not something that scares the Jewish community, nor is the Jewish community against it in any way — not even those who oppose the serving of Palestinian food at Conflict Kitchen. They simply have questions about what being Palestinian means, and believe the answer to be in political opposition to them.
The serving of Palestinian food at Conflict Kitchen is almost certainly not anti-Israel, and even if it was, Conflict Kitchen is within its rights to oppose whomever they want. The humanization of Palestinians is also important because Americans often think of foreigners as distantly removed from them. Sometimes we forget that the rest of the world is filled with people, not news headlines.  Food is a very stark reminder of this.
However, portraying the resistance to Conflict Kitchen as a neurotic reaction to the humanization of Palestinians does a disservice to the public understanding of the conflict. Not talking about conflicts every chance we get simply makes us ignorant. I probably have not mentioned even half of the arguments people actually make against Conflict Kitchen, but the real problem here is the fact that even a meager straw-man argument is the closest public discourse has come to truly engaging the issue.

Oct. 31 marked a tragic day in privatized space travel when Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo, a suborbital spaceplane designed for space tourism, crashed as the result of an in-flight breakup and killed one pilot. However, this tragedy will have little to no effect on the growing success of the privatized space industry, nor should it.
With something as risky as space travel, the possibility of tragedies occurring along the way is unavoidable. However, people like Virgin Galactic’s Sir Richard Branson, SpaceX Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Elon Musk, and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos will not be held back. They have made it clear that they wish to revolutionize and privatize space travel. Musk has went as far as envisioning a colony of 80,000 on Mars, predicting that he can bring down costs to $500,000 per person. .
People think he is crazy to say something like this when NASA’s Curiosity rover hit costs of nearly $2.5 billion. However, the amount of funding that NASA spent on its space shuttle program was much larger than the $400 million that Virgin Galactic spent on the development of its SpaceShipTwo. Crazy people like Musk are the ones that revolutionize the world. Government programs like NASA are too matured, bureaucratic, and costly to do something as radical as this.
While Virgin Galactic’s crash was horrific for those involved, those in the private space industry can be thankful that this occurred during a test flight and not while a number of wealthy, most likely prominent, citizens were aboard. The negative spotlight that would have resulted from such a disaster might have overshadowed the private space industry with backlash from investors and the general public.
Despite the fact that the SpaceShipTwo crash was indeed a tragic event, the private space industry is at an all-time high in profits, popularity, and potential. Companies like Virgin Galactic and SpaceX promise a bright future out of this world. Private universities such as our own are coming closer than ever to sending private rovers to the moon at a fraction of the cost of a NASA rover.
More importantly though, companies and universities will not simply go to space; they will bring space to the masses. Someday, SpaceX and Virgin Galactic will make travel to space more accessible than ever. Carnegie Mellon’s Andy Rover team, in conjunction with Astrobotics, is currently working on a project to bring virtual moon travel to the public with an Oculus Rift linked to its Andy Rover cameras.
Whether through virtual reality or physical presence, private companies and universities will bring space closer to the general population than ever before. Sure, there will be road bumps along the way, such as the Virgin Galactic accident. However, one thing is for sure: in the past half-century, the government has proven that it cannot succeed in its space travel goals affordably. Only minds like Musk, Branson, Bezos, and those found at universities like Carnegie Mellon will make them a reality.

On Oct. 27, Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane announced the arrest of eight suspected child predators, among them Carnegie Mellon graduate student Adham Mandour, who is pursuing a master’s degree in biology. Mandour is charged with child pornography possession and distribution, and was arrested on Carnegie Mellon’s main campus, according to the attorney general’s office press release.
When relaying information about crimes or other situations that could potentially harm campus members, the university typically either issues information through official communications or crime alerts.
According to Ken Walters, the university’s executive director of media relations, the Dean of Student Affairs “may take summary action or implement interim measures that limit a student’s ability to be present on campus ... and/or interact with specific members of the university until a resolution is reached” for incidents that pose immediate concerns for the well-being of campus members. For incidents in which the university deems criminal activity to be a “serious or continuing threat to the university community,” the university issues crime alerts.
When determining whether or not to announce the arrest to the larger campus community, the university followed its standard protocol, as outlined by Walters. However, as the university assesses future cases of a similar scale and nature, The Tartan hopes that the university will consider making exceptions on a case-by-case basis to its crime communications protocols regarding high profile cases like Mandour’s, especially as Carnegie Mellon attempts to establish itself as a campus with appropriate transparency amidst the sexual assault investigation that the Office for Civil Rights is conducting.
Through a conversation with Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno, as well as conversations amongst The Tartan’s editorial board, The Tartan agreed that the case did not pose immediate concerns for the safety or welfare of students and did not pose a serious or continuing threat to individuals. 
This conclusion is based on the information that the student was immediately detained from campus and, therefore, the situation did not necessitate a communication based upon standard protocol.
However, information about the arrest was shared on local news station WPXI. To some, the university’s choice not to inform the campus community about the arrest in light of WPXI’s story may seem as if the university wished to withhold information from its students and faculty. In high-profile cases that capture the attention of local media, The Tartan hopes that the university will respond with an official communication or alternative channel to inform campus members of the incident so that the university is not perceived in this light.
In this instance of Mandour’s case, The Tartan hoped for the university to issue an official communication explaining the incident in appropriate detail. 
Furthermore, the university should have explained that, since the incident had not been assessed to be an immediate threat to campus members, it therefore followed its standard protocol in its decision not to issue an initial alert. The Tartan hopes that communications which deviate from the standard protocol will be provided if a case like Mandhour’s occurs again.
The university prides itself on being communicative with the larger campus community, and while the university’s intentions when not sending out a crime alert for this case were not to block the campus community from knowledge of the case, the lack of a communication could be perceived that way when the case is relayed to campus members through other sources, like WPXI and The Tartan itself. In this and many other ways, Carnegie Mellon should strive to be an open campus.

Controversy is brewing in one of the most unlikely places: The hot topic on many executives’ and advocates’ minds is the new nutrition labeling proposal put forward by the Federal Food and Drug Administration. 
The proposal, which was made at the beginning of the year, would be the first significant transformation of the Nutrition Facts label since 1993.
Though the proposal suggests several changes, including updated serving sizes and the removal of the “Calories from Fat” section, the buzz in the food industry is around one specific change: the addition of an “Added Sugars” section. Added sugars in this case are classified as those which are not originally present in foods, but are added during production and processing. 
The FDA proposes labeling these extra sugars due to expert findings suggesting that added sugars lead people to consume less nutrient rich foods, and more calories overall. In essence, added sugars represent “empty calories.” Currently, Americans consume, on average, 16 percent of their total calories from added sugars.
Food producers have been livid about the proposed changes, claiming that there is no scientific evidence to support the addition of an added sugars label. This is no surprise, considering added sugars have infiltrated almost every product on the market from ketchup, to crackers, and beyond. This is hardly surprising since the human brain has been shown to respond to sweetness in a way that is similar to cocaine.
All of these added sugars have added up; it has now been shown that Americans eat three times the amount of sugar they need on a daily basis. Yet opponents continue to argue against the new labeling. Forbes magazine has even argued that the proposal violates the corporations’ first amendment right to refrain from speaking.
However, by this argument the FDA should have no authority to mandate any disclosure of nutritional information or ingredients; the information that is important for consumers to protect their health much like the added sugar label. 
The World Health Organization has warned against excess sugar intake due to its link to a number of serious health issues. Therefore it is critically important that consumers be able to assess where these excess sugars are entering their diet from, especially due to the overwhelming presence of sugar in today’s food market.
Food is a $5 billion dollar industry, and there is no doubt that they will do everything in their power to prevent this new legislation from passing. 
Citizens need to stand up for their right to know what is being put in their food, especially if this measure is to pass. We can only hope that the FDA will abide to its founding purpose of protecting consumer interests.

As artists who have traveled in Israel and throughout the West Bank in 2013, and as attendees at two recent events sponsored by Conflict Kitchen (including the Oct. 7 lunchtime discussion with Dr. Nael Althweib and Professor Ken Boas), we take issue with some of the claims reported in Laura Scherb’s story “Conflict Kitchen’s Palestinian theme causes contention.”
Apart from quoting one Pitt student who felt “uncomfortable and unsafe” at the discussion, Scherb does not establish that any of her other sources have actually attended any Conflict Kitchen programming related to Palestine. 
As witnesses to the variety of accounts and opinions that were presented by articulate people in a civil manner in broad daylight in Schenley Plaza (a public space), we are dismayed that anyone could have feared for their safety and find such remarks either naïve or inflammatory.
While eyes may have been rolled at some comments, the discussion was lively, but respectful, and we neither saw nor heard any ridicule or muzzling of any speaker. In fact, an Israeli veteran, a spokesman from the Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh, and Israeli citizens all contributed to an informative exchange and dialogue. 
There was both defense and critique of Israel and the impact of its policies on the daily lives of Palestinians.
Academia and public life are full of presentations that deliver points of view without rebuttals. A focus on Palestine does not necessitate an equal focus on Israel, especially in a country like ours that is so politically and financially committed to supporting Israel, the largest beneficiary of American foreign aid. This and the preponderance of media support for Israel is apparently not enough, though the Conflict Kitchen event we attended gave plenty of space to pro-Israeli voices. There is simply no credence to the claim that Conflict Kitchen is excluding “other voices.”
As stated on its website, Conflict Kitchen “uses the social relations of food and economic exchange to engage the general public in discussions about countries, cultures, and people that they might know little about outside of the polarizing rhetoric of governmental politics and the narrow lens of media headlines.” This iteration of Conflict kitchen is doing exactly that. 
While Tartans 4 Israel proposes a “Coexistence Kitchen” that will engage its “audience with trivia questions,” we applaud Conflict Kitchen’s solid research, authentic and delicious cuisine and thought-provoking programming. Conflict Kitchen provides substance and sustenance.

It’s safe to say that the 2014 midterm sent a message. After the polls closed on Tuesday, Republicans found themselves gaining at least seven but likely nine senate seats, at most five but likely three governor’s mansions, and between 12 and 15 seats in the House of Representatives. This gave Republicans control of the Senate, their largest House majority since the 1920s, and two-thirds of the governorships in the country. Additionally, Republicans now control more state legislatures than they have at any time since 1860. 
No matter how you slice it, Republicans had a great election and now control the vast majority of the country’s political centers of power, with the exception of the presidency. What makes this more interesting, however, is the fact that Republicans vastly outperformed every single predictive tool used this election. A bold pundit before the election would’ve had Republicans picking up seven seats in the senate, rather than the six they needed to take control of the upper chamber, in addition to picking up three or four seats in the house and losing a few governorships.
The polls also reflected this, showing tight senate races in North Carolina, Georgia, Kansas, Colorado, Iowa and Alaska and tight governor’s races across the board. Meanwhile, high profile democratic pundits started claiming that the polls were skewed toward Republicans, citing systematic under-sampling of Latinos and other minority demographics more inclined to be left-leaning. Even preeminent polling analyst Nate Silver wrote a piece before the election, claiming that 2014 would see GOP gains, but only because they were playing on favorable territory. For the most part, this election was to be simply a reversion to the mean of political control, erasing democratic advantages and leaving both parties with even control across the nation.
As it turned out, the polls were skewed, but toward Democrats and by an average of four points. Races that were supposed to be close ended up being double digit GOP victories, and surefire Democratic wins in Virginia and New Hampshire turned into last minute nail biters decided by less than two percentage points. Nobody saw GOP gains of this magnitude coming, regardless of the quality of analysis done. Instead of inheriting a broken Congress against a bitter president, the GOP achieved a strong mandate to govern, with the American people unilaterally rejecting Democratic candidates in all states, even electing Republican governors in deep blue Illinois, Maryland, and Massachusetts, and casting their lot to the right wing of American politics. 
Now that the GOP has inherited this mandate, it comes to them to decide what to do with it. There’s no doubt the next few months will bring new challenges to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), as many GOP candidates who won in 2014 made their opposition to the President’s signature legislation a central part of their campaign. With the completion of this election, fully half of the senators who voted for the ACA are no longer in office, and the Republican House has time and again passed legislation repealing or altering the ACA in some way. This legislation was never brought up for debate in the Democratic Senate, but now that Republicans control the upper chamber, there’s no doubt that this issue will receive serious attention.
Additionally, a cursory whip count reveals that the Keystone XL pipeline very well may have the 60 votes it needs to pass the state and end up on the President’s desk, putting it only a veto away from approval. This may be another matter that the GOP Senate attends to within the first 90 days of their newfound political control. 
Additionally, the Republican House of Representatives has passed numerous right-leaning jobs bills and budget proposals, namely Paul Ryan’s infamous budget that puts a lot of GOP policy ideas into the federal economic architecture. These were never brought up for debate when Democrats controlled the Senate, and the GOP will likely revisit them.
In sum, everyone thought 2014 would hand the GOP a little more control in what would remain a divided and dysfunctional government. Instead, the GOP gained a mandate to govern and work with Obama to make government work again. There is no doubt that after the election, the ball is in the Republicans’ court. They have the responsibility to bring about change in our national political environment, and start working to achieve the ends that voters put them in Congress for. This election has given them the power to do just that. What remains to be seen is how the GOP will use that power, and how Obama will work with them.
