Carnegie Mellon’s football team will be joining the Presidents’ Athletic Conference (PAC) at the start of the 2014 season as an affiliate member, while still maintaining full University Athletic Association (UAA) membership in all other varsity sports.
The Tartans will continue to play football against their UAA opponents, Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Chicago. The team will also continue to play against Case Western Reserve University’s football team, as it will be joining the PAC in 2014 as an affiliate member alongside Carnegie Mellon.
Carnegie Mellon was a full member of the PAC from 1968 to 1989, until joining the UAA conference in 1990 as a founding member. 
During their time in the UAA, the Tartans won eight UAA championships and won an NCAA Division III playoff game against Millsaps College in 2006.
“We’ve had a great relationship with the UAA,” said Carnegie Mellon head football coach Rich Lackner. “We’re one of the founding members, and we have a strong commitment to the UAA as a sports association. We’ve had some great competition in the UAA over the years.”
Joining the PAC conference will enable Carnegie Mellon football to qualify for NCAA playoffs, being that the UAA is not a qualifying conference with only four football team members. Although UAA teams can be invited to the playoffs, PAC champions are automatic entrants into the NCAA Division III playoffs.
“The best part about rejoining the PAC is that a lot of old rivalries will be renewed,” said junior fullback Jake Nardone. “It’s also exciting to know that an automatic playoff bid will be up for grabs every season.”
There were also scheduling difficulties, given the lack of football teams in the UAA. 
“It’s very difficult these days to schedule three UAA games, and then not have another conference or affiliation to go along with and just try to schedule seven independent games,” Lackner said.
The PAC will also bring more competition closer to home, as conference members include teams from Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky, and the Tartans will not have to travel to Illinois for conference games. The wider variety of competing teams will enable the Tartans to experience new offensive and defensive schemes, as well as build new relationships with other teams.
The Tartans hope to compete at the high level they once did in their first stint in the PAC, which included a conference championship in 1989. The current first-years will lead the Tartans as seniors in their first season in the PAC.

Just a day after former Penn State University football coach Joe Paterno was reported to be in critical condition due to his two-month battle with lung cancer, he passed away at the age of 85 on Sunday.
Paterno’s legacy is immortal. Despite the recent scandal involving former Penn State football assistant coach Jerry Sandusky and numerous children Sandusky allegedly sexually assaulted, Paterno’s legendary 62-year coaching career outshines any tarnishing that may have happened during the last three months.
Paterno’s coaching career — entirely with the Nittany Lions — includes five undefeated seasons, three Big Ten Championships, and two National Championships. His 409 Division I-A FBS wins are the most in the history of college football. He also topped every coach in bowl game appearances (37) and victories (24). His “coach of the year” awards are in no short supply and he superbly deserved his Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year honor in 1986. His induction into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2007 came as no surprise to all college football followers.
The résumé so inadequately listed above is just a speck of how truly great Paterno was. Since joining Penn State football as an assistant coach in 1950 and his promotion to head coach in 1965, Paterno built the football program into one of the most dominant in college football history, and was also a hero to the entire campus.
In 2010, the Maxwell Football Club of Philadelphia established the Joseph V. Paterno Award to be given to the college football coach “who has made a positive impact on his university, his players and his community.” But after the Sandusky scandal the following year, the award was discontinued.
I implore the world to not follow the lead of this club. Do not let your last memory of Paterno be his defining moment in your minds. Sixty-two years of greatness outshines, dissolves, and — may I say — excuses three months of scandal. He may have been quiet when he needed to speak up, but he was influential beyond imagination in the most positive of lights.
As abruptly as his career at Penn State ended, his precious life was taken away from all of his fans at Penn State and from all of his admirers nationwide. His heart beat for Penn State football and his blood was colored royal blue and white.
Yesterday, the legendary Paterno passed away, leaving behind an unmatchable legacy. Where everything started for Paterno is where it ended — at Penn State. He was hospitalized at State College Hospital, and it is poetic that his life would end at the place where he gave so much love and received so much respect.

The epic saga of the NBA has begun since we last covered it. The lockout-shortened season of 66 games in 123 days is a formula for excitement, with more NBA games per day than one could have ever hoped for. However, the big news this week is that Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook signed a five-year, $80 million contract extension. Amidst this hectic, compressed season, did the Thunder prematurely pull the trigger on this deal with its point guard?
Westbrook’s play since being drafted fourth in 2008 by the Seattle Supersonics (and moving to Oklahoma City in 2008) has been dominant, dynamic, and superstar-worthy. His career numbers are gaudy, and his quickness and athleticism are only matched by his draft-mate Derrick Rose, the number one pick of that draft and the reigning MVP. Yet Westbrook has always been criticized for his erratic shooting, his questionable decisions, and his shoot-first mentality — given that he’s a point guard and given that his teammate, Kevin Durant, is a two-time scoring champion.
His line of 17.9 points per game, 7.0 assists per game, and 4.8 rebounds per game is impressive, and over the last two years he’s averaged 20-plus points per game. But Westbrook’s shooting percentage is a lukewarm 42.3 percent for someone who shoots as much as he does. His 27.4 percent shooting from the three-point line is equally mediocre. 
Additionally, the suspect decision of Westbrook’s contract extension is proven more questionable by the well-documented rifts between Durant and Westbrook. Earlier this year, during a time out, they had an argument that had the media riled. When asked, they said they have no issues, but the camera never lies. Both are potent scorers and have garnered the right to shoot a high volume of shots; given Westbrook’s efficiency woes, why should the Thunder hold on to a point guard who takes shots away from the more efficient Durant (46.3 percent career shooting, 49.8 percent this season)? Having two volume scorers is not a good formula for a championship run.
Westbrook is most definitely a superstar, but he is not the right fit for Oklahoma City. Durant was signed to a big contract extension last year, signifying the Thunder’s desire to hold on to him. Given the chemistry between the two players, the extension led most to believe that Westbrook would leave the Thunder either by trade or free agency. 
Westbrook’s contract extension makes sense if the trade route is the direction the Thunder is heading in. Even though Westbrook is having a down year, no team would argue his superstar status, and many would jump at the chance to trade for him.
An interesting trade that comes to mind would be to make a move for the Boston Celtics’ all-star point guard Rajon Rondo. Celtics’ general manager Danny Ainge recently reported that they would be willing to blow up the “big three” of former all-stars and future Hall-of-Famers Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, and Kevin Garnett if it meant a better situation. Although Rondo is the piece they would like to hold on to, if those three players were to be elsewhere next season, building a team around the shoot-first Westbrook makes more sense considering that, sans Jeff Green, the pass-first Rondo would have no good scorers to pass to. Westbrook would have the chance to play with his former teammate, Green, and would be excellent for helping the storied franchise rebuild, especially if Ainge blows up the Celtics.
For the Thunder, Rondo’s rebounding and defense matches Westbrook’s, yet he is a much better passer and decision maker. Rondo’s 9.4 assists per game are second in the NBA, and those assists in Oklahoma City would be effectively dealt to Durant and guard James Harden, who could fill the second scoring option role nicely. Also, you can’t forget how close Rondo and now-Thunder center Kendrick Perkins were when they were both in Boston. Rondo was very upset when the trade was made that sent Perkins to Oklahoma City.
The Thunder is favored to win the Western Conference — but Westbrook might not be part of the formula that could bring the Larry O’Brien Trophy to Oklahoma City. Given how quickly the season is rolling along and considering the approaching contract extension deadline, maybe the Thunder felt pressured to pull the trigger on keeping Westbrook. Only time will tell if this is a good parntership and only a championship will prove its worth.

Sophomore mechanical engineering major Jacquie Shaw has been one of the top performers for the women’s basketball team this season. She is third on the team in scoring and rebounding, and second in field goal percentage, helping lead the Tartans so far in the 2012 season (6–9, 0–4).
Shaw enjoys the communal aspect of being on the basketball team. “I have played basketball since third grade,” she said. “It’s not hard to find girls passionate about basketball, but it is rare to find people that are just as passionate about academics as they are about basketball.”
Shaw is averaging 11.1 points per game on 51.0 percent shooting. She is also grabbing 5.7 rebounds a contest.
Her most impressive performance this season was in the Tartans’ opening game against Elmira College last November, where she lead the team with 24 points and nine field goals.
This season, Shaw’s goal is to improve her overall record and play. “I am sure you know of our less than successful record last season [(...)] and we just want to get better every single day,” she said.
Her teammates respect her abilities and her focus on the basketball court. “Jacquie is a hard worker, she comes to practice every day focused and ready to work,” said junior forward Emily Peel. “She is also a great competitor and aggressor in games. She looks to drive to the basket, get steals, and set up her teammates.”
Shaw couldn’t put her finger on what she thought was the funniest memory of the team, but admitted there are a lot of funny moments. “Jennifer Elkin is definitely the clown of our team. She is always instigating something or singing with her voice of an angel to keep things lively,” Shaw said.
Shaw loves the lifestyle of a college athlete, as she is fond of traveling for road games. “I’m from the West Coast so I’ve never been to a lot of these cities before, and though we don’t spend a lot of time in each city, I appreciate it. Last year was the first time I’d ever been to New York, and it was cool to walk around Times Square,” Shaw said.
Along with seeing new places, Shaw and her team have a lot of fun on the road. “On away trips, I just like to chill out and listen to music,” she said. “It’s nice to get away from campus. Since I don’t have a television in my house, I also can’t complain about the television and hot tub that hotels provide.”
Another part of the team’s culture is eating. “I think the basketball team will eat about anything, especially if it’s free. But I must say we have a soft spot for Chipotle and pasta. We eat a lot of pasta,” Shaw described.
When asked what she was planning on doing post-graduation, Shaw said, “After completing my degree, I have no idea what I would like to do. Maybe something with engines.”
The Tartans play the New York University Violets (9–6, 1–3) this Friday on the road in a conference rival match-up.

Carnegie Mellon spinoff BirdBrain Technologies, in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute, recently created Brainlink, a device that enables its users to add additional functionality to small robots and other electronics.
Tom Lauwers hails from both development teams, as he is the founder of BirdBrain Technologies as well as a 2010 graduate of the Robotics Institute. He led the development of the Brainlink system, which is housed in a white, triangular chassis that fits in the palm of one’s hand and only weighs about three ounces.
But the system’s small size is by no means an indicator of the range of its capabilities.
“The Brainlink can learn the infrared signals from a robot’s remote control.... It can, on command, replay those signals,” Lauwers said. “It can also store those signals, or you can store the signals on a computer. Basically, storage is unlimited.”
Data storage is far from the only “unlimited” property the Brainlink system has to offer. The unit’s intuitive programmable interface, paired with its extensible, open-source Java API developed by Lauwers and his team, allows its users to create multiple programs for interfacing with the host robot. The system also comes with a database pre-populated with signal data for popular robots, but Lauwers ran through an example of how one would use the Brainlink with a device absent from the database.
“You could take the remote that comes with the robot,” Lauwers said. “You would hit the forward button on the remote, and point it at the Brainlink, while running an infrared signal analyzer program on your computer. The signal would get captured and stored, and then you could write a program that tells the Brainlink to replay that signal. So now if you put the Brainlink on your robot and point the Brainlink infrared LED at the infrared receiver on your robot, you could make the robot go forward by using the computer program.”
The robot’s other abilities can be programmed into the Brainlink in a similar manner. If the sensors provided by that particular robot aren’t enough, the Brainlink unit also incorporates an accelerometer and a light sensor that can help the robot react to different types of accelerations or ambient light levels. Several auxiliary ports for connecting other types of sensors, like proximity sensors or GPS receivers, are also provided.
Perhaps the system’s most appealing feature is its Android API, which allows developers to create new Brainlink Android applications or export existing Brainlink desktop applications to the Android platform. These applications can then send commands over Bluetooth to the Brainlink unit, which in turn relays them via infrared signal to its host robot. Tutorials detailing how to establish this Bluetooth connection, program the Brainlink, and even customize its onboard firmware are available on the system’s website, brainlinksystem.com.
Lauwers emphasized that, while the Brainlink system can easily be picked up by any typical robotics hobbyist, its true aim is to inspire and cultivate a desire for robotics in students interested in the field.
“We ran a small pilot where we had 16 high school students try out our prototype,” Lauwers said. “One kid just amazed me. He made a server to control his TV from anywhere. The server was running on a computer that was connected to Brainlink, so he could talk to the server from any other internet-connected computer or phone, and use it to turn off his TV ... that was pretty memorable.”
Because the Brainlink system interfaces with its host devices via infrared, it can also be programmed to work with a television or DVD player, although Lauwers warned that “it’s not meant as a substitute for an off-the-shelf universal remote control.”
Lauwers also mentioned a potential project involving controlling robots with Microsoft’s Kinect motion-sensing device via Brainlink.
According to a Carnegie Mellon press release, Brainlink was funded in part by a Small Business Innovation Research grant from the National Science Foundation. BirdBrain Technologies is also working on another project called “Hummingbird,” aimed at middle school students, that will enable them to build robots with typical arts and crafts materials. The project is slated to be released in March.

Mushrooms are used as building materials, mosquitoes are genetically modified to help prevent the spread of malaria, and other collisions of art and science are displayed at the most recent exhibition at the Miller Gallery, titled “Intimate Science.” Last Friday, the exhibition opened its doors to the public.
The exhibition is the product of collaborative work, curated by Andrea Grover, a 2010 Andy Warhol Foundation Curatorial Fellow in residence at Carnegie Mellon’s Miller Gallery. In her current project, Grover endorses creativity to address some of the world’s pressing problems.
“They both have an end goal of revealing some kind of truth,” Grover said about art and science. “I want people to take creativity more seriously, to see that creativity is not just a kind of frivolous pursuit, but that it can have value towards answering these bigger questions about humanity, like how are we going to survive, how will we provide food and energy, transportation, and shelter for growing populations.”
Grover’s research on the project began in 2010. She examined artists who placed themselves in industrial or scientific environments to conduct their work in the 1960s. However, in today’s internet age, artists have greater access to information and more opportunities to conduct their work with science and technology. Creating new building materials and performing provocative biological experiments is now a reality for some artists.
Philip Ross, a San Francisco-based artist and one of six artists whose work is featured at the exhibition, used fungal materials, specifically the fungus species Ganoderma lucidum, to create building materials. To do so, he cultivated the soma, or the body of a mushroom. A mushroom’s soma is typically hidden from view in the wild.
“A mushroom is actually just the reproductive organ of a much larger organism,” Ross explained. “When you pick a mushroom or see a mushroom, it’s just this tiny percentage of what’s often hidden from view, which is inside of a tree or hidden in the ground.”
To cultivate the fungi, Ross uses a pasteurization process which involves steam cooking a material containing cellulose and adding a living mushroom to it. The fungi then colonize the material by eating all of the cellulose and transforming into chitin, the main component of fungal cell walls, which provides its strength properties. After about two years of growth in a vessel chosen by Ross to control the eventual shape, the result is a mushroom-brick with remarkable strength. 
“Their dynamic resistance will stop a bullet and will crush metal,” Ross said. Ross built various structures using this material, and suggested that not only is the material a possible wood or plastic substitute, but that it’s a natural material in the wild and therefore has little impact on the environment during and at the end of its life.
Another project within the exhibition illustrated ways of using the natural environment to perform intricate tasks, like producing laser-cut glass objects. Markus Kayser, a German collaborator in the exhibition, achieved this by making a machine that consisted of a laser cutter that amplified natural sunlight via a magnifying glass bulb and using it to melt sand into glass. Kayser took his “Sun-Cutter” into the Sahara Desert in August 2010 to test out his machine, which produced glass objects using the abundant supplies of sun and sand in the Sahara.
In addition to new sustainable building materials and processes, the exhibition also displayed the work of a series of biological experiments aimed at solving ecological problems, such as the dwindling American chestnut tree population and the spread of malaria through mosquitoes. The results of these experiments were shown by the Pittsburgh-based Center for PostNatural History, which acquires and maintains “postnatural” organisms that have been modified through selective breeding or genetic engineering. 
“The organisms we have on display here all have something in common,” said Richard Pell, a Carnegie Mellon professor of art and director of the Center for PostNatural History. “These are all transgenic, for one; that means they have DNA from some completely different kind of species added to their DNA.”
Pell explained that the American chestnut tree population is dwindling because of the spread of a certain species of fungus that kills them. The researchers and artists are experimenting with injecting the trees with genes that kill off the fungus.
To address the spread of malaria, researchers at the University of California at Irvine modified the mosquitoes, which carry and spread malaria, by injecting them with genes that destroy the mosquito’s ability to carry Plasmodium, the parasite that causes malaria. These injected genes are able to propagate more easily than the natural mosquito genes, in theory eliminating Plasmodium ’s ability to survive, and the threat of malaria to humans.
Similar to Ross’ fungi-based building materials, these experiments address big issues, which may raise some eyebrows. 
“Both of these are specifically being designed not just to exist in a little plot of earth, but to repopulate an entire ecosystem, which is kind of a provocative idea,” Pell said. “It’s certainly one that we should be thinking a lot further about.”

Identifying whether or not two images are similar may sound like a simple task. While a human would surely be able to match similar images to one another, a computer lacks such inherent visual processing capabilities. Presented with this problem, researchers in the Robotics Institute have developed a new algorithm for identifying “uniqueness” that has yielded strikingly accurate results.
The new techniques were developed by professors Alexei Efros and Abhinav Gupta and research associate Abhinav Shrivastava of Carnegie Mellon, as well as post-doctoral researcher Tomasz Malisiewicz of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The techniques are vastly different from those of previous image-searching software; instead of finding similarities in broad areas such as colors and shapes, the research team focused on finding “unique” aspects of an image. Put more simply, instead of comparing two images side by side and trying to identify the similarities, the image in question is compared to a large number of other images and their differences are identified.
Gupta said that most programs “simply latch onto the language of an image.... We were interested in latching onto the content of the language.” The researchers also realized that this idea of focusing on content could span across different domains, such as paintings, sketches, and photographs, which previous photo-matching methods struggled with.
To determine uniqueness within an image, the program compares it to a group of randomly selected images. Instead of focusing on the color of individual pixels, where one may lose the image in a transition from sketch to color photo, the system points out an image’s unique qualities by finding which pixels or objects of the image are rarely found in the randomly selected images.
For example, if one searched a painting of the Sydney Opera House, the system wouldn’t focus on traditional domain characteristics like color and texture, or common items like trees. It would instead notice the distinct wave-like shape of the building.
The researchers have already tested numerous applications. One program allows users to take snapshots of where they are and retrieves their location from Google Maps. The computer searches for visually similar images, then hones in on the latitude and longitude of the scene to determine the user’s location. The system can also construct what is called a “visual memex,” a data set that allows users to more easily examine the visual similarities between multiple images. The user is able to search through this graphical data set or even create a movie of the visually similar images.
The Carnegie Mellon research is creating a stir in the technological sphere. Shrivastava went to Hong Kong to present the findings at SIGGRAPH, a computer graphics and technique conference. According to Gupta, response to the project has been very positive and has gained interest from other computer scientists. 
One shouldn’t expect to have a program with this algorithm installed on one’s computer soon, however. The program, although incredibly accurate, takes much more processing power and time to compute than current image-searching programs — around 45 minutes for one search.
Despite this long search time, the researchers are proud of their work.
“We didn’t expect this approach to work as well as it did,” Efros said in a Carnegie Mellon press release. “We don’t know if this is anything like how humans compare images, but it’s the best approximation we’ve been able to achieve.”

NASA’s Kepler and the search for Goldilocks
The Kepler Space Telescope, whose mission is to find potentially habitable planets outside of our solar system, has been on a roll recently. In the past week, scientists connected to NASA’s Kepler Mission have published findings of newly identified planets, and the results are “stranger and weirder than fiction.” One team observed a planet orbiting around two different stars, while another discovered the smallest planetary system thus far known to science, both firsts of their kind. Although both planets are outside of the “habitable zone” — the region around a star where liquid water can exist — the quest to find Earth-sized planets that might be “just right” for life continues.

Bird flu study sparks outrage, fear, and debate
In November, a team of scientists from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Erasmus Medical Center (Netherlands) was preparing to publish virology research on a mutated strain of the H5N1 virus — commonly referred to as “bird flu.” The mutated virus found in the scientists’ studies was able to become airborne and contagious between ferrets, indicating that the new strain would be highly contagious in humans compared to the common strain of H5N1. 
The scientists announced last Friday that they would put a 60-day moratorium on their research when the public, other scientists, and governments asserted that the potential publication of their research would pose an extreme bioterrorism threat.

Medical device advances field of cell sorting
A manuscript accepted for publication in Analytical Chemistry this week outlines a novel cell sorting method that could be used for detecting tumor cells in blood samples. Researchers used a well-established sorting method that relies on tagging cells with antibodies that contain magnetic beads, and then separating them from untagged cells within a magnetic field. 
The breakthrough comes from the device that the team created: Using a microfluidic device scaled specifically for finding rare cells, the scientists were able to sort cells at much lower concentrations than previously possible. This opens the magnetic separation method as a possible tool for other disease diagnostics.

One journal, one university, two different takes
Separate research groups at Cornell University are making contradictory claims about the greenhouse gas impact of energy from shale-derived natural gas versus coal. 
Professor of ecology Robert Howarth claims that problems like methane leaking in natural gas extraction from shale makes its greenhouse gas impact “perhaps more than twice as great” as that from coal. His research is met with a strong opposition voice from colleague Lawrence Cathles, who calls Howarth’s study “seriously flawed.” Both pieces appeared in the latest issue of the journal Climatic Change, and come at a tense period of debate for New York state, where there currently exists a moratorium on high-volume hydraulic fracturing methods of gas extraction.

Enzyme research finds a friend in Pac-Man
Bacteria are to lysozyme as power pellets are to Pac-Man. That is the analogy used by Philip Collins, lead investigator of a new study published in the journal Science that demonstrates how lysozyme, an enzyme found in saliva and tears, is able to eat through a bacterium’s cell wall, causing it to explode. In the experiments, scientists attached the enzyme to a carbon nanotube that acted as a transistor, which amplified the signal of the lysozyme’s chomping motion. The study helps to shed light on the detailed chemical mechanism for how these “Pac-Man” enyzmes do their job in our immune systems.

Building retrofits a savvy investment, new study says
A new investigation prepared by Deutsche Bank and Living Cities says that retrofitting city housing dwellings is good not only for the environment, but also for investment. The first benefit is simple to understand: Replace an existing light bulb with a more efficient one, and you will save energy. But banks have been slow to underwrite loans for large-scale retrofits, and such projects usually rely on public subsidies. The study used a 231-building dataset to conclude that such retrofits can easily offset the loans required to pay for them by savings in energy costs.

Pittsburgh Community
As you may have seen on the internet or in this week’s Forum section, Pittsburgh is now considered a hip city (at least according to one media outlet). Despite students’ and other young people’s moaning and groaning about the lack of things to do or places to go, there’s actually a lot going on in the Steel City. This is especially true for the local music scene — a scene that seems to be growing every day.
From house and techno to classical and opera, every sector of the music world has a presence here. The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) is world renowned and brings incredible soloists to the city each season. The Smiling Moose and 222 Ormsby consistently bring small metal and punk shows to the area, and venues like brillobox and Mr. Small’s Theatre bring bigger indie-rock shows. No matter what neighborhood you go to — from Lawrenceville to the South Side to Downtown — or what type of music you listen to, Pittsburgh’s music scene is quickly expanding to fill all of your live music desires.
A small but vibrant community surrounds Pittsburgh’s burgeoning electronic, house, and techno scene. With the start of the VIA Music and New Media Festival in 2010, Pittsburgh put itself on the map as a city with a real audience for these types of music. Since then, other smaller events have been popping up all over the city, including, most recently, a monthly house DJ event hosted by Humanaut called Out of Order.
Juan Lafontaine, a WRCT community DJ and one of the founders of SwitchboardPGH, a website that tracks upcoming music and art events in the area, said, “Between VIA, Humanaut, random people here and there, and just in general how DJs, techno, and house are all becoming a little more mainstream and acceptable on a regular basis ... it’s allowing more DJs to be invited to Pittsburgh for concerts and shows.”
He continued, “Pittsburgh is starting to get that name for itself — in the sense that DJ, house, and techno live in Pittsburgh, as well. And once people realize that Pittsburgh has a scene for that kind of music, then more and more things are bound to happen.”
VIA isn’t the only event bringing DJs to Pittsburgh. Venues like the Shadow Lounge in East Liberty, Belvedere’s in Lawrenceville, and the recently opened Static in the Strip District are all hosting DJ events on a regular basis.
Pittsburgh may be more of a city for DJs than bands, but that doesn’t mean that good bands don’t come here. It’s true that Pittsburgh isn’t an indie-rock lover’s ideal city: Too far from the coast to be a part of the main East Coast indie circuit and not quite large enough to be a destination city for artists, Pittsburgh is often overlooked. It’s important to give credit where credit is due, however. Venues like Mr. Small’s, Stage AE, brillobox, and Altar Bar do bring some quality acts to the city, and college students take advantage of the limited offerings.
As major consumers of music and frequent concertgoers, the large student population in Pittsburgh helps fuel the indie-rock music scene. Amy Cooper, marketing director at Stage AE, has seen firsthand the way the indie music scene has grown over recent years. “It’s just something that’s sort of caught on and it’s stuck. There have been a lot of artists that have come out and have done the same genre of music, and people just seem to really connect with it,” she said. “[The music scene has] even grown from where it was a year ago, so I think it’s going to continue to be really big.”
If you haven’t explored Pittsburgh’s music scene in the past and are interested in it, this spring is the perfect time to get out there. Within the next three months, Blind Pilot, Big Gigantic, Dr. Dog, and The Kooks are all coming to Mr. Small’s in Millvale; Grimes and Cloud Nothings are coming to brillobox in Lawrenceville; and countless other bands are playing at Club Zoo, Club Cafe, and Altar Bar, among other venues.
For classical music fans, the PSO is a major benefit of living in Pittsburgh. Founded in 1895, the top-notch orchestra puts on phenomenal performances nearly every weekend, often with impressive guest conductors, soloists, and special festivals. The PSO has played a significant role in developing Pittsburgh’s cultural scene.
In the fall, the orchestra brought some big names to Pittsburgh, including violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. This spring, you can look forward to more outstanding guest performances and, as always, hearing all of the classics from the PSO: Brahms, Mozart, Mendelssohn, Haydn, Wagner, and more. All PSO performances are held at Heinz Hall in downtown Pittsburgh, and you can find more information about student tickets on the PSO’s website.
Pittsburgh is also home to an impressive opera company. This spring the Pittsburgh Opera is presenting Engelbert Humperdinck’s Hansel & Gretel, Giacomo Puccini’s Tosca, and Wolfgang Mozart’s The Abduction from the Seraglio.
Carnegie Mellon Campus
If you’re sitting there thinking, “All of these places are at least a bus ride from campus and it’s way too cold outside for that,” no need to worry. There’s a lot going on right here on campus. The Activities Board (AB) has four committees committed to bringing a wide range of music to Carnegie Mellon, both in genre and concert size. Each of the AB committees brings live shows to campus every semester, and WRCT, the campus radio station, hosts a spring dance party every year that features student DJs.
In the past, the AB committees have brought The Black Keys, Tokyo Police Club, Guster, The Books, and many others to campus. “I think we do a pretty good job of putting shows on across the campus and bringing diverse entertainment to campus,” said Adam Kriegel, a senior electrical and computer engineering major and president of AB. “We have at least two shows per month between the Underground, Skibo, Coffeehouse, and Concerts, and I think that’s pretty good when you consider the campus size.”
Kriegel noted that indie acts, in particular, find Carnegie Mellon’s campus a welcome place to play. “I think because they know Carnegie Mellon as kind of a nerdy school, and I think there’s also a hipster thing tied to the university, so people think it’s going to be the hip, cool place to play,” Kriegel said. “So bands are always excited and usually not disappointed.”
AB Skibo works to bring local artists to campus. You can look forward to hearing Jeremy Sessa, Sleep Experiments, Tim Ruff, and Jeremy Colbert all in the next few months. AB Underground also hosts smaller artists, including Chris Frasco, who will be playing this week. Celine Berger, a sophomore in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences and the co-chair of AB Underground, said, “For the Underground, we try to bring in more acoustic shows because of the sound constraints, and the actual venue can’t really handle bigger acts.”
Small acts are happy to come play, however. Berger noted, “A lot of people that we book contact us first.”
Additionally, the School of Music frequently hosts both student and guest performances in Kresge Theatre, in the College of Fine Arts building. The spring semester is always full of senior recitals, so keep an eye out for promotional posters around campus.
With so much going on both on campus and in the community, it’s easy to see why Pittsburgh is considered a hip city. The DJ, house, and techno scene is blowing up, indie artists are starting to see Pittsburgh as a city worth playing, and there’s a consistent demand here for quality classical music. So if you’re looking for a good way to spend an evening, venture out and see who’s playing. You can go downtown, to Lawrenceville, or even stay right here on campus — wherever you go, you’re sure to find what you’re looking for.

Even before it was released earlier this month, The Fault in Our Stars has promised to stand out from the rest of John Green’s bibliography. This is in no small part due to Green’s unprecedented decision to sign all 150,000 copies of the first printing of his fourth novel (fifth if you include Will Grayson, Will Grayso, which he co-wrote with writer David Levithan).
The Fault in Our Stars lives up to the tremendous hype that Green’s cult following has built around its release, such as Photoshopping images of the book on to Ferdinand Pauwels’ “Martin Luther’s 95 Theses.”
Like all of Green’s previous works, The Fault in Our Stars explores the depths of the human condition and the ways in which the relationship between the self and society changes. However, the book feels much more immediate and visceral than anything else Green has written, perhaps barring his first book Looking for Alaska.
This can immediately be attributed to the two central characters in the novel, Hazel Lancaster and Augustus Waters, two teenagers who have been diagnosed with thyroid cancer and osteosarcoma, respectively. Both main characters display the wit and humor that are characteristic of Green’s work, but the knowledge that either character could die at any time results in the humor merely magnifying the constant threat of death. The supporting cast — fellow cancer patients, an emotionally volatile family, and health care professionals who are oblivious to the lives of their patients — also contributes to the bleak tone of the book.
Green’s dedication to his work shines most brightly within The Fault in Our Stars. It is not hard to see why, considering Green has previously stated that this novel was partially influenced by being a chaplain at a children’s hospital, an experience that had a great impact on him. The epigraph, an excerpt from a book that exists only within the world of The Fault in Our Stars, and the use of the band The Hectic Glow — a musical idea proposed in Green and his brother’s YouTube series Vlogbrothers — help to create a very insular universe.
While at times The Fault in Our Stars seems to lack the feeling of having an overarching plot, it becomes a montage of moments held together with teenage intellectualism and emotional confrontations that somehow manages to remain cohesive.

Seniors Terence Einhorn, majoring in Chinese and decision science, and Adam Kriegel, majoring in electrical and computer engineering with a concentration in audio engineering, have found the secret to remaining sane under the pressures of their coursework. Their unlikely partnership as The Rhythm Thief, a jazz-infused hip-hop experiment incorporating the work of local rappers and artists, provides an outlet for them to escape the grind of classes and academic responsibility.
On Feb. 10, the group will release its first E.P. entitled 5234 Forbes Avenue, a five-song collaboration with local Pittsburgh group Heroes & Terrorists, better known as H&T, which includes Carnegie Mellon sophomore business administration major Kai Roberts.
Einhorn and Kriegel met as first-years and began making music together by the time they were sophomores. During their junior years, they moved into 5234 Forbes Avenue, the house which their E.P.’s name honors. According to Kriegel, they began dabbling in hip-hop as seniors because it was the simplest form of music for them to create as amateurs. However, this frame of mind quickly expanded as they explored the genre.
“As we started to get more advanced, all of us started to realize that hip-hop could be a pretty serious art form,” Kriegel said. Their respect for the intricacies of creating memorable beats is apparent in the layered songs on the E.P.
The name “The Rhythm Thief” derives from the first track of a Sparks album that tells the story of a mythical demon thief stealing the beats out of songs.
“The idea is so genius; this tiny, little, crazy dude stealing instruments from people,” Einhorn said. Although he admits he never really knew what the song was about, he wanted to represent this idea. “It’s not me, it’s my sound,” he explained. Einhorn had always worked under this name, so when he and Kriegel created the project, they assumed the title by default.
When working together, they represent the opposite sides of a spectrum: Kriegel compared Einhorn to a cook or a chef, while he assumed the role of a food chemist. Kriegel looks at the frequencies and qualities of noise, performing tasks in the very beginning and end of the process. Setting up, mastering, and editing all fall under his role as audio engineer.
“You’re looking for a specific sound,” Kriegel explained. “You have to make sure it’s ready for radio play, ear buds, a person’s phone walking down the streets, radios.”
According to the duo, the countless number of uncertainties demanded attention to detail in order to eliminate audio problems. They made an analogy to a goalkeeper: The audience only notices him when he’s doing a bad job. Using this as a guideline for their music, they knew that a song was complete only when they could no longer hear flaws in it.
While Kriegel works to lay down the beginning pieces of a song, Einhorn adds the instrumentation. His musical background in jazz enables him to compose using saxophone, flute, clarinet, guitar, and bass. They emphasized the fact that they do not use any sampling in their tracks, calling it a “cheap art form.” Many of the instrumentals are live recordings of Einhorn playing one of the instruments from his repertoire. He said that he continues to learn whatever instrument he can get his hands on.
As they work together, each puts layer upon layer into a piece, one at a time. They use what they call a model of regression, switching off working on a song until they reach a conversion point where they’re happy with what they have produced. Some tunes seem to come quickly and naturally, while others can take as long as several months to finalize.
The addition of H&T, a local hip-hop group that includes Roberts, Anthony Fulton, Bilil Abbey, and Mike Combes, adds a distinctive and essential element to their music. For Einhorn and Kriegel, it was a completely different but welcoming world. “We hadn’t been exposed to people of their talent or level before,” they explained, nor had they ever worked with rappers before. When writing verses to use on a track, the two groups collaborated to figure out its meaning. One of the most prominently featured members of H&T is Fulton, also known as Alumni, who was essential in writing several of the tracks.
The Rhythm Thief recorded its album at 5234 Forbes Avenue. “The house has some definite spirit — it’s perfect for creation,” Einhorn said. Kriegel agreed that there’s a definite ambience to the house, and that the two of them are always in a state of creation. The accessibility of their present (admittedly limited) equipment allowed them to take the time to experiment and record when they were struck with inspiration.
Kriegel and Einhorn are considering continuing to work with H&T to create a complete album, depending on the success of the E.P. The group can be found on Facebook and Soundcloud, and a free download of 5234 Forbes Avenue will be available Feb. 10.

What do old clawfoot bathtubs, trendy fedora hats, and a potato gun have in common? They can all be found at Wild Stuff, a pop-up vintage store that opened Jan. 14. Nestled away in Lawrenceville, Wild Stuff makes for a fun Saturday afternoon trip to find treasures big and small.
Wild Stuff is the result of three Lawrenceville stores — Wildcard, Botero Development, and Zombo Gallery — joining together to fill an unused storefront. The store is only open on Saturdays and will run while the storefront is available — so it will only be around until the end of March. It is located at 4300 Butler St., just across the street from Wildcard, which offers trinkets, cards, craft supplies, and more.
Brian Mendelssohn of Botero Development said that the pieces of furniture on sale “are from projects that we buy — houses and buildings.” This results in some great finds, such as washing machines from the 1920s to 1950s, which are currently selling for as low as a dollar each. According to Mendelssohn, customers often find creative uses for these machines, such as turning them into coolers or kegs.
Music and art are also prominently featured in the storefront, including pieces from Zombo Gallery, which closed down more than a year ago. Michael “Zombo” Devine, a well-known DJ who is currently a community DJ at WRCT, sells some of his radio shows in the form of stacks of CDs. Additionally, plenty of albums are on sale for a dollar apiece, ranging from The Beatles to Nine Inch Nails.
Eccentric items are in abundance at the pop-up sale. Baseball fans can pick up ex-Pirates player Jason Bay in bobblehead form for a dollar. Those looking for fun T-shirts — like one with a print of a Chihuahua sporting sunglasses — can find those too. Fridges, an old treadmill, guitars, and vintage roller skates are just a few more examples of the treasures one can find at the sale.
More practical items are available, too; there are plenty of winter coats on sale. For the college student on a budget, a $10 coat that you wouldn’t mind getting ruined or lost at a party isn’t a bad idea. Framed record label covers, handmade lanterns, and twinkling Christmas lights would all make any living space livelier.
Most of the items are displayed in some semblance of order on tables, but in some areas, sifting through trinkets is required for finding quirky treasures; this is all part of the fun of going to an unconventional vintage store.
As for why the sale is dubbed “pop-up”?
“It pops up, grabs you by the ankles, [and] shakes out all the loose change,” Zombo joked.

“Ennui” is a word that means an endless boredom, a state that sets in as you begin to believe you will never be interested in anything ever again. It is also a local band, Thursday’s first opener, which played a short set while the Shadow Lounge filled with people escaping the blowing snow of Pittsburgh winter. Ennui was actually quite good, and people didn’t seem bored to tears. Rather, the crowd largely ignored the first opener as those in attendance deposited their coats in the Blue Room and ordered drinks from the bar.
Stage rearranged, Beacon began. The audience didn’t visibly react, but people were listening: The music was pretty loud and it was a small space. Beacon’s set was a non-event. The highlight was the group’s last song, a cover of Katy Perry’s “Last Friday Night,” excerpted and stretched to become nearly unrecognizable. It was perfect, but I am not convinced the audience really got it. The group distorted a pop song that most of the people in the room likely looked down upon until it was nearly unidentifiable.
Tycho took the stage after Beacon, beginning immediately as the audience moved past its unflappable behavior into loud cheers. They were here to see him. Tycho played synths, keyboard, laptop, and occasionally guitar. There were no vocals. He was accompanied by Zac Brown on bass and guitar and Rory O’Connor on drums. The show was really centered around Tycho and the visuals he created, which were projected behind the band.
The projected video presentation brought the show together. The visuals were largely abstract, almost ephemeral. Sky and seascapes with the occasional girl staring into the camera were brought in and out of focus, oversaturated with added lens flares and flashes of magenta and yellow. There was also a clear fetish for natural particle systems: Flocks of birds and the embers of a fire were overlaid in the video. The entire picture was often warped to be kaleidoscopic.
The visuals didn’t tell a story, but they were part of the environment that Tycho was creating. And they were his own. Tycho is the musical stage name of Scott Hansen, whose other alias is ISO50, a graphic designer and visual artist and the creator of the stylized visuals that back his musical persona.
With visual artist Scott Hansen and musician Scott Hansen together, it was quite a show. The audience cheered at the end of nearly every song. The smooth, almost ambient, electronic music was performed in large part identically to the studio versions, only intensified by the live performance. 
The place was a sea of hipsters: There were more men than women, wearing a spectrum of dark colors, flannels and beanies, thick scarves, thick plastic glasses, and sporting facial scruff. Most of the room refused to do more than sway, and a few people at the front were dancing like they were at a different concert entirely.
Drinks were served, the visual show went on, several members of Tycho’s team filmed the event, a few people soldiered on with their wild dancing, a girl on her cell phone kept nearly knocking over the monitor, Tycho played “Elegy” to close the set, and the crowd headed back out into the snow.

Head writer of Saturday Night Live and host of SNL's “Weekend Update” Seth Meyers performed standup comedy last Friday to an excited audience at the Byham Theater. While he is most well known for his humorous commentary on politics and news, Meyers’ routine focused more on his personal experiences and on funny stories from his life. This different persona of the popular comedian made for a surprising and hilarious show.
Most comedians, musicians, and other entertainers often open their performances by playing to the audience — talking about the city and their experiences there over the years. Meyers was no exception, going right into detailed descriptions of Pittsburgh and the local culture.
However, he wasn’t merely indulging the audience with humor about the city. He discussed how his father is a Pittsburgh native from East Liberty, and how Pittsburgh Steelers games were a Sunday ritual growing up. He wasn’t just name-dropping places in the city; rather, Meyers had actual experiences here, which was a great personal touch to the show.
It would be impossible for Meyers not to discuss the Republican presidential candidates, given its prominence in the news and his position on “Weekend Update.” Never overtly political, he described Rick Perry as “George Bush 0.5” and compared Ron Paul to the old guy in horror movies who warns the kids that the house is haunted.
Meyers’ better material revolved around his personal observations, such as the varying levels of intoxication in Las Vegas and how tough bar patrons don’t appreciate sarcasm.
While the show had the audience consistently laughing, there were a few sections that seemed rather lackluster. In one portion of his show, Meyers presented rejected “Weekend Update” news briefs that were too risqué for television. The punch lines often dealt with old topics, and thus felt stale. Not only did they lack the flavor that jokes dealing with current issues have, but they also lacked originality, staying afloat only through the crutch of crude humor. While not detrimental to the show, it was definitely one of the least enjoyable points.
Despite this, Meyers had the audience captivated. One of the funniest parts of the show was when he retold stories from his experience as the headliner for the 2011 White House Correspondents’ Dinner. He recounted the event itself, but also discussed what happened before and after the show, such as his awkward handshake with President Barack Obama.
He continued with his story, explaining that his expectations of being featured as the hilarious headliner of the dinner were dashed when, the following day, Taliban leader Osama bin Laden was killed. His admission that he was the only person in America who was upset that they had killed bin Laden had many in the audience nearly in tears.
Away from his news desk at “Weekend Update,” Meyers still delivered a performance that was entertaining and comedic. His connection with the audience was undeniable. The show dipped at times when he revisited old SNL material, but Meyers’ ability to entertain with unique content made for a hilarious and personal show.

The My Little Pony series has taken on a surprising fan base, now appealing to fans of all ages, including college students. These older fans of the show, or “bronies” as they are commonly known, are everywhere and they’re on the verge of starting their own club here at Carnegie Mellon.
The My Little Pony toy line has been an important property for Hasbro since the early ’80s. Even those who did not purchase the plastic horses or the overpriced play sets can likely recall the extensive advertisements and the infectious jingle. A cornerstone of that marketing campaign was the cartoon series. The latest iteration of toys was given an accompanying television series in 2010 called My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, which was helmed by Lauren Faust. Faust told Wired that she created the show to have appeal far beyond the targeted audience Hasbro called her in for.
Edward Garbade, a first-year computer science major and the main organizer of brony events on campus, announced their unofficial club last Saturday. This news was met by cheers from fellow bronies, who had just finished watching a Friendship is Magic episode that ended with the moral that people should be proud of their accomplishments, even if they didn’t do as well as they’d hoped.
The bronies in the audience genuinely care about the show — one latecomer screamed and cursed in surprise at a minor character speaking for the first time. “It’s just a really, really, really good show,” Garbade said about the group’s general enthusiasm towards Friendship is Magic. “As weird as it seems, watching a show about pastel-colored horses is very entertaining.”
The show has become a respectable series, unlike earlier versions of the show that were often considered low-quality, long-form commercials. “They used to be just huge marketing schemes,” said Michael McGinnis, a junior statistics major.
Jit Nandi, a sophomore decision science and computer science double major, explained that he likes the show because it reminds him of the cartoons from his youth, which were often straightforward comedy that managed to convey important life messages. When asked if he ever felt embarrassed about his passion and attending Friendship is Magic viewings, Nandi said, “I feel like a badass for coming here.”
Fellow students react to the bronies in a relatively neutral manner. “I think ‘bronies,’ as I’ve heard them called, are trying to stay nostalgic by clinging on to new things that remind them of old TV shows like Powerpuff Girls,” said Charlie Grealish, a first-year electrical and computer engineering major.
While Faust, largely credited for the success of My Little Pony, has left the show, the fans remain optimistic. After the meeting had ended and some jokes about the episode were shared, the bronies left to make “snow ponies” and consider plans to continue making chalk drawings of their favorite Equestrian characters.

In January of 1971, art historian Linda Nochlin asked the world, “Why have there been no great women artists?” Her question leads to an inquiry into understanding the foundations on which art is created. Nochlin put forth the idea that women have been institutionally blocked from achieving artistic excellence, or success, regardless of their skill or intelligence.
You may be wondering, what exactly does this have to do with music, let alone this school’s radio station? You see, despite three waves of feminism and much social progress, there are still no great women DJs.
A look at DJ Mag's top 100 DJs of 2011 contains exactly zero women. The more adventurous and experimental Resident Advisor lists the names of only eight women. Is Nochlin’s argument also true in the electronic music world?
Heteronormative notions of sexuality dominate the electronic music scene. Women who are interested in making their names as DJs are seldom taken seriously and are thought of as “cute” or as having some sort of ulterior motive; yet, even those who do take the time and energy to learn the craft are expected to cater to the crowd’s expectations of the “sexy female DJ” by donning high heels and playing erotic tunes.
It seems unfair that female electronic musicians are being pigeonholed into such meretricious classifications. Fortunately, some female DJs are pushing the envelope and working to redefine DJ culture.
Ellen Allien has run BPitch Control, one of the most influential electronic music labels, for over a decade. Magda fiercely parades her stripped-down metallic horror techno. Nina Kravitz uses her voice as a layering tool to tear down conventions of normative sexual behavior. I only hope that more women follow these artists’ examples and explore the vastly uncharted area of the female DJ.

Dear Patrick,
I’ve been sick with mono all winter break. I’m feeling better now, but I’m not sure how I got it in the first place. I know I don’t want to get sick again. Do you have any tips for preventing a relapse?
Thanks,
Keeping Isolated, Should Stay Indoors, Need Guts During Illness, Should Easily Avoid Social Encounters
Dear KISSING DISEASE,
Consider mono punishment for your hedonistic lifestyle. The debauchery that defined your last semester is going to have to go if you want to stay healthy. For starters, no booze. Mono messes with your liver, so if you have a drink, you’ll die. Probably. I don’t actually know, but that sounds about right. Next, don’t trip and fall, or your spleen will explode and you’ll die. That’s actually true, so make sure your shoes are tied. Don’t overexert yourself or you could be too tired to go home, and you’ll collapse in the street and die.
I know, I know — drinking until you’re falling down in the street is your favorite hobby, but that’s probably what got you into this in the first place.
Mono is the anti-fun,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
Have you heard about this SOAP and Pippa Middleton thing? I had to write a paper the other day, but Wikipedia was down. What does the royal family have to do with Congress and bathing? Luckily, one of the computer science boys on my floor got me around it.
I need this explained,
Anything Remotely Technical Might Actually be Jibberish Or Rubbish
Dear ART MAJOR,
You’re probably the last person on the planet to hear about this. It’s not SOAP and Pippa everyone’s concerned with, but SOPA and PIPA, or the Stop Online Piracy Act and the PROTECT IP Act. Basically, everyone’s freaking out because they say it will censor the internet. Some of the concerns are legitimate and some are overblown, but everyone’s in a huff about it.
You probably don’t need to worry about Wikipedia going black again. It was an emergency move to stop those bills from passing.
You won’t have to learn to write a paper any time soon,
Patrick Hoskins

Angels in the Outfield
8 10 12
Angels in the Outfield tells the story of the down-on-their-luck California Angels baseball team, which gets a little help from above after a kid who wants to be closer to his father prays for the team to play better. Next thing you know, angels begin helping the players perform spectacular feats on the diamond. There’s also a recent football version of this movie: It’s called Tebow in the Backfield: The Story of the Denver Broncos’ 2011–12 season. Fun Fact: the film features appearances from several future stars, including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Matthew McConaughey, and Adrien Brody.
Moneyball
7:30 10 12:30
You might think that a movie about a baseball team’s general manager wouldn’t be very entertaining, but you’d be wrong. Brad Pitt is at his finest as Billy Beane, the man behind the curtain for the Oakland Athletics. Beane’s trailblazing tenure has revolutionized the way Major League Baseball teams, analysts, and scouts look at statistics; he also introduced the word “sabermetrics” into every baseball fan’s vocabulary. Since the original book was published, the Oakland Athletics have made one trip to the playoffs and have three winning records in eight seasons. Way to let everyone in on your secret formula for success, Beane.
The Sandlot
8 10 12
For those of you at all interested in sports, this was likely one of the first movies you ever saw. The Sandlot is a classic tale about a group of young boys growing up in 1962 who play baseball every day during the summer at a local sandlot. Things start to go awry when a baseball signed by the “Colossus of Clout” himself is lost to “the beast” and the boys resolve to get it back. The movie features so many memorable quotes and scenes – they couldn’t possibly all be listed here. Darth Vader is in this movie though, and that alone should be reason enough to see it.
Field of Dreams
8 10 12
“If you show it, they will come.” That must have been what the Activities Board was thinking when it made Field of Dreams the Sunday feature film. This 1989 fantasy-drama film is one of the all-time classic pieces of American cinema. Kevin Costner stars as Ray Kinsella, a farmer who hears a disembodied voice telling him to build a baseball diamond in his cornfield. A fantastic and well-told tale involving a reclusive author and the Chicago Black Sox scandal unfolds over the next 90 minutes of this heartwarming story. A must-see for every movie buff. Fun Fact: The real-life “Field” was sold for over $5 million in 2011.

The Gates Center for Computer Science and Hillman Center for Future-Generation Technologies have officially become one of the nine buildings recognized by the American Institute of Architects (AIA) this year, winning the 2012 American Institute of Architects Honor Award for Architecture.
Opened in 2009, the Gates Hillman Complex was designed by Atlanta-based firm Mack Scogin Merrill Elam Architects and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Henry L. Hillman Foundation. They contributed $20 million and $10 million towards its construction, respectively. 
The AIA jurors remarked in their official decision that the Gates Hillman Complex is “scaled perfectly within an urban campus and within a uniquely difficult site.”
“Perhaps the most wonderful aspect of the project is a set of views and visual connections created by transparent interior glazing and non-reflective exterior glazing, as well as carefully placed and angled floor plates,” the jurors added.
Stephen Lee, dean of the School of Architecture, said that the award was “the profession acknowledging good accomplishments and work in architecture.” 
Lee said that the Gates Hillman Complex’s distinct, “contemporary” look visually separates it from the yellow-bricked buildings that line the Cut.
Guy Blelloch, a professor of computer science who described himself as “a university representative who guided the program,” was involved in the selection of architects for the building’s design as well as overseeing its development.
Blelloch said, “I think [the award] is great and well deserved. We’ve been very happy with the building.”
Blelloch described the benefits that the building offered to its inhabitants, stressing the natural sunlight the interior receives. “We’re not all in little boxes,” he said.
Lee also spoke of the advantages the Gates Hillman Complex offers to occupants, especially in the creation of an effective work environment.
Pointing out the building’s design and, in particular, inclusion of natural sunlight, Blelloch said that it presents an open atmosphere where students and professors will  feel at home and be able to work collaboratively.
Many of these advantages, Blelloch said, are due to the unique architecture of the building, with  angled windows to maximize sunlight and open cafe areas available on multiple floors, which foster a communal feeling. 
Not everyone likes Gates’ architecture, however. 
Ben Pattison-Gordon, a junior bachelor of humanities and arts student with a focus in architecture, said that, though he likes the exterior of the building and the fact that it has many environmentally friendly aspects, he has reservations about the interior, particularly the helix ramp.
“It’s cool that the handicap-accessible part is the central focus,” Pattison-Gordon said. “But navigating around the helix is really tedious. It makes getting anywhere take forever.”
Pattison-Gordon is also ambivalent about the Randy Pausch bridge, which he said he prefers unlit. “That much rainbow is really excessive. It detracts from the architecture around it,” Pattison-Gordon said.
The Gates Center for Computer Science and Hillman Center for Future-Generation Technologies has already been awarded Gold LEED certification, with the 2012 AIA Honor Award for Architecture adding another honor to the building.

Carnegie Mellon celebrated Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday last Monday with a half-day of classes as well as several events, performances, and speeches. 
Kicking off the festivities, University President Jared Cohon gave his annual State of Diversity presentation.
The presentation went over new and existing university policies intended to increase diversity, as well as the statistics that are helpful in measuring diversity, such as enrollment rates among different demographics.
“Diversity has been a high priority for the university and me personally for more than a decade,” Cohon said. “In the last couple years, though, having recognized the excellent progress we have made, we altered our approach a bit.”
“We didn’t focus so much on numbers, but also on the cultural aspects of diversity. We expanded our understanding of diversity to include more than usual, more than just ethnicity, race, and gender, but to include all that makes people different from each other,” he said.
Cohon emphasized that increased diversity benefits the university in many ways. 
Referencing the faculty hiring process, Cohon said, “We want to make sure there is adequate diversity in the pool. That’s all we can really ask for. We don’t want to hire someone just because of their race or gender. But when you make an extra effort to ensure diversity, it usually gets a higher quality pool. Because you made an extra effort to look harder, you found better candidates.”
“I was at last year’s address,” said sophomore acting major Jordan Phillips. “It was interesting to see the progress between the years.” 
Phillips was generally impressed by Cohon’s speech. “I thought the points made were very realistic. The process that was taken to enhance diversity on campus was very clear, very meticulous.”
At the lunch and panel event “A Social Justice Experience: Cultivating Social Moments,” members of the Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh communities discussed modern issues of race and gender in light of King’s achievements in social justice. 
Assistant history professor Nico Slate, whose research focuses on U.S. social movements and struggles against racism, spoke about the unacknowledged racial segregation that still exists in America. Slate emphasized the importance of finding meaningful solutions rather than dwelling on or being overwhelmed by the problems at hand.
Bernard Franklin, a consultant and friend of the King family, gave the keynote address. 
In his speech, titled “The Courage to Lead,” Franklin focused on what it takes to be a leader like King, and how future leaders in the audience should be aware of all the leadership opportunities they run into. 
Through detailed accounts of stories from the King family, Franklin wrestled with how to resolve the conflict between King’s human and superhuman traits. 
Although Franklin never met King, he met his wife, Coretta Scott King, and recounted conversations with her about her late husband. 
Franklin constructed a contrast between the human details of the family and the inherent superhuman qualities that come when talking about the deceased civil rights leader.
“So many times we put him on a pedestal, and we said he wasn’t human, he wasn’t part of us. But this man was. He had his challenges; he had his issues, his struggles with life that we all have,” Franklin said.  “But what possessed [Martin Luther King Jr.] to step into Montgomery, Alabama...? How could a young man, at the age of 26, step into the most demanding, the most humiliating, the most pressing role?”
Franklin recounted his own struggles with leadership. 
When he was young, he said, he wanted to be the President of the United States. Though Ms. King tried to help him achieve his political goals, Franklin said that he, unlike King, ultimately gave up these ambitions for a quieter life. 
“I had the Democratic Party starting to speak to me about being governor of Kansas,” Franklin said. “But I was 28 years old. I had just gotten married and had a family. The best of my life was still ahead of me. But my world in many ways was out of control.... I told Ms. King, ‘I just can’t do it.’ ”
However, Franklin strongly encouraged the audience members who do have what it takes to be aware of opportunities for leadership. 
“The universe is always creating opportunities,” he said. “You’re going to meet people. You’re going to sit besides people on an airplane. You’re going to come into contact with someone at a bookstore. Your paths are going to cross with people who have significant influence on your life. But some of you are going to walk by them because they don’t ‘look like you....’ But that may be your ticket to walk to whole other place in time.”

An employee of Carnegie Mellon housekeeping services was arrested by University Police on Jan. 6 for several alleged acts of theft on the campus.
The suspect, John Szalajda, is an employee of an independent janitorial contractor.
According to an article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Szalajda, 38, stole more than $25,000 worth of precious metals, wires, and other materials from Wean Hall and two floors of Roberts Hall, where offices of the department of materials science and engineering are located. In an official crime alert sent out to all university members, campus police chief Thomas Ogden, said that Szalajda allegedly found a set of master keys in a parking lot and used them to open professors’ offices to commit the thefts. Ogden emphasized that the incident was very unusual.
Chris Pistorius, a professor of material science and engineering who works in Wean Hall, remarked, “It was pretty disturbing while [the theft] was going on.”
He said that the department had been losing valuables since August 2010, and that students’ research had been disturbed. People had to take apart some devices , lock them after experiments, and reassemble them when they wanted to use them next. 
“It was a relief that someone was caught,” Pistorius said.
In an open forum last semester, University President Jared Cohon articulated issues concerning campus safety, saying, “The university has a good, solid set of procedures which should cover any ethical, moral, or legal breach you can think of.”  
He urged students to report to campus police if they witness any violation of ethics.

CMU-Q pledges advice to Qatar for 2022 World Cup
Carnegie Mellon Qatar and Hassan Al-Thawadi, the Secretary General of the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee, signed a memorandum of understanding last Monday in which they agreed to commit to the successful hosting of the 2022 International Federation of Football Association (FIFA) World Cup.
In December 2010, FIFA awarded hosting rights of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. Now, in the memorandum of understanding, Carnegie Mellon Qatar has pledged to provide expertise in research, strategic studies, and executive education to the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee.
The signing was accompanied by a speech from Al-Thawadi at the Qatar campus.
“Working with local partners is an important part of the Supreme Committee’s strategy moving forward,” Al-Thawadi said in his speech, quoted by a Carnegie Mellon press release. “Our goal is to harness the expertise of institutions in Qatar, ensuring that the delivery of a successful event in 2022 is a nationwide effort.”
The dean of Carnegie Mellon Qatar, Ilker Baybars, was also quoted in the press release, saying, “Through this memorandum of understanding, Carnegie Mellon Qatar is looking forward to being a strategic partner of Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee in national capacity-building efforts, scientific research projects, and Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup projects, empowering a generation of future leaders in Qatar.”
CMU assists in software development certification
Computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon are working with the Kenya Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Board to create a certification exam for Kenyan software developers. 
The exam is intended to eventually serve as a benchmark for employers of software developers everywhere.
“Kenya is emerging as the epicenter for ICT innovations and a software development hub,” Bitange Ndemo, permanent secretary in the Ministry of Information and Communication, said in a Carnegie Mellon press release. 
“We want to lead from the front and be the technology partner of choice on the African continent,” Ndemo said. 
The exam would be different from current software developer certifications in that it would require applicants to actually write software.
Most current certifications simply test applicants on their general knowledge.
Randal E. Bryant, dean of the School of Computer Science, spoke in the press release about the obstacles Carnegie Mellon and Kenya face in the development of the certification. 
“Our challenge is to identify the general skills that software developers must have and then develop model software systems that will enable us to evaluate those skills during an exam,” he said.  “We also must make certain that the exam remains up to date and affordable.”

He is currently the E.C. Chadbourne professor in the department of art history, theory, and criticism at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
An Automata-Theoretic Model of Programming Languages
Monday at 3:30 p.m.
Gates Hillman Complex 9115
Uday S. Reddy will deliver a talk about a new model of programming languages inspired by automata-theoretic concepts. 
In the model, objects are viewed as automata, described from the outside by their observed behaviors, and internally as state transformations.
Reddy will discuss the model’s connections to previous models and to demonstrate the efficacy of the model by proving test equivalences.
Reddy is a professor of computer science at the University of Birmingham. His research focuses on the areas of programming with state and linear logic, among others.
AB Lectures: The Onion
Monday at 6 p.m.
McConomy Auditorium
Members of the award-winning satirical newspaper The Onion will visit Carnegie Mellon to discuss what makes good satirical writing. 
The Onion has been in print since its inception as a University of Wisconsin-Madison student paper in 1988. Its online version has won 21 Webby Awards.
Some of The Onion’s most well-known articles include “Black Man Given Nation’s Worst Job,” which covered the election of President Barack Obama, and “Drugs Win Drug War,” originally published in print during The Onion’s time as a student newspaper, which mocked the War on Drugs.
School of Art Spring Lecture Series: Wafaa Bilal
Tuesday at 5 p.m.
Kresge Theatre
Wafaa Bilal, an assistant art professor at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, will deliver a lecture about his work.
Bilal’s brother was killed in a drone attack in Al Kufa, Iraq, and he fled the country in 1991. 
He came to the United States after spending two years in refugee camps.
Much of Bilal’s art aims to protest and shed light on violence and casualties in Iraq. 
Bilal is also known for using his body in his art. 
In 2010, Bilal had a map of Iraq, with the number of Iraqi and U.S. casualties, tattooed on his back. 
For Bilal’s current project, he had a camera surgically implanted into the back of his head. The camera transmits images to the web 24 hours a day.

Last Wednesday, many websites, including Google and Wikipedia, blacked out or symbolically blacked out their services. These websites’ aim was to protest and raise awareness about the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and PROTECT IP Act (PIPA), two Congressional bills that were drafted to cut down on online copyright infringement, but that opponents claim will seriously harm free speech on the internet. Here are some facts about SOPA, PIPA, and the blackout: 
5 million: the number of active users of the torrent site The Pirate Bay in 2007
13: the number of U.S. congress members who withdrew their sponsorship from SOPA or PIPA after the blackout
7 million: the number of signatures on Google’s anti-SOPA petition
5: the maximum number of years a person could spend in prison for streaming 10 pieces of music or movies under SOPA

The bookstore’s normal closing times for the Spring 2012 semester are 6 p.m. on Mondays and Tuesdays and 5 p.m. Wednesday through Saturdays. These times seem reasonable for most of the semester. 
However, the times are unreasonable for the first week of classes. Many students start the semester without knowing which textbooks they will buy or even which courses they will take. 
Students often do not get out of class until 4:30 p.m. or later. By the time they get a chance to buy textbooks, the bookstore has already closed.
Campus bookstores are in danger. They face threats from online markets like Amazon and half.com, as well as digital textbooks and online rental services. 
Bookstores are caught between providing an important service to students and competing in a market in which they no longer have a monopoly.
In this environment, one would expect the Carnegie Mellon bookstore to take advantage of its inherent strengths: convenience, availability, and personal service. In some ways it has done this — the bookstore now offers rental services and direct price comparisons to Amazon and other websites. However, the bookstore’s restrictive hours are inconvenient to students trying to purchase textbooks in the evening.
Instead of its current practices, the bookstore should follow the model of the university libraries and adjust its operating hours based on  the current stage of the semester. During the first few weeks of classes the bookstore should be open until at least 8 p.m. 
After the rush dies down, it can change its hours to reflect the lower demand. This alteration is only necessary for the lower level of the store — the upstairs merchandise section has a different customer base and should continue to set its special hours based on alumni, parents, and prospective students.
Traditional campus bookstores serve an important purpose. A bookstore with student-centered policies is more convenient, and sometimes cheaper, than buying books online. Carnegie Mellon’s bookstore should continue to improve its policies to better serve students.

With spring comes an assortment of seasonal icons — soft rains, blooming flowers, and (eventually) warmer weather. But the best of these seasonal markers are those that are edible: fall ushers in the pumpkin pie, winter brings the sale of candy canes, and spring marks Girl Scout cookies and their ever-cheerful, badge-bearing band of young marketers. This year, however, in addition to a sweet tooth, I’ll be counting gender equality as my motivation for tracking down extra boxes of Thin Mints come spring.
While the Girl Scout cookie has long faced opposition from those concerned with health, the cookie faces a tougher, more politically charged battle this year. The Girl Scouts of America have been bombarded by protests in response to a Colorado troop’s October decision to admit a 7-year-old transgender child into its troop. Bobby Montoya was born with male genitalia, but has identified as female since age two. Yet when the request came to join the local Girl Scouts chapter, panic broke out. Initially, the Girl Scouts of Colorado rejected Bobby, but after a national outcry, it reversed its decision and stated in a press release, “If a child identifies as a girl and the child’s family presents her as a girl, Girl Scouts of Colorado welcomes her as a Girl Scout.”
The decision to admit a transgender child quickly sparked an uprising, especially among conservative groups. Most prominently featured in the media is the response of a 14-year-old Californian Girl Scout who represents a group calling itself honestgirlscouts.com. In a video posted on YouTube, the girl calls for a complete boycott of Girl Scout cookie purchases during this year’s sales. The girl then invites fellow scouts and other supporters to visit the group’s website, which features accusations of the Girl Scouts of America’s “liberal-progressive” beliefs which, in addition to supporting LGBT rights, also evidently approves of abortion rights, Planned Parenthood, and radical activism.
With this swell of controversy descending just as Girl Scouts nationwide kick off their cookie campaigns, cookie sales will certainly be pointed to as proof of how the Girl Scouts should deal with issues of gender equality and acceptance in the future. I, for one, would hate to see cookie sales drop this year. Instead, I encourage those who support the Girl Scouts’ decision to buy as many cookies as they can fit in their cupboards — because who doesn’t like the sweet taste of victory?
You can find the closest cookie sales to your location via the Girl Scouts’ “Cookie Finder” at girlscoutcookies.org.
Courtney Wittekind (cwitteki@) is a contributing editor for The Tartan. Her favorite cookies are Shortbread and Thin Mints.

It’s that time of year again. The snow is falling, stores are filled with early Valentine’s Day chocolate, and the Port Authority is once more running out of money.
Facing a projected $64 million deficit, the transit authority spelled out the details last week of a 35 percent service cut that would take effect in September if sufficient funding can’t be found. The proposed changes make last year’s 15 percent cut look like a mere bump in the road: reduced service on all routes, with 48 of them eliminated outright and all but 13 of them shut down after 10 p.m. Fares are scheduled to increase in July, and continued service of the 28X depends on the renewal of a federal grant, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
Despite the severity of the announcement — Port Authority CEO Steve Bland called it “the beginning of the end of public transit as a significant carrier in the region” — Carnegie Mellon students and long-time Pittsburghers alike could be forgiven for feeling a bit skeptical. Doesn’t this dire prediction happen every year, and doesn’t some official always dig up a bit of loose change to keep the buses running? Usually, but that attitude misses the point. The bottom line is that public transportation in Pennsylvania is consistently underfunded; emergency bailouts are a symptom, not a solution. If the Port Authority has to go out busking instead of busing every time the annual budget is due, it’s because the authority continues to lack adequate support from the county and state governments. State aid, which makes up the majority of the Port Authority’s income, dropped 19 percent last fiscal year.
Of course, a lack of state-level funding for transportation projects of all types is another well-known problem. Last April, Governor Tom Corbett created the Transportation Funding Advisory Commission and asked it to develop a plan to reverse perennial under-investment in Pennsylvania’s roads, bridges, and public transit systems. The commission delivered its final report in July, recommending a series of revenue increases that have gathered support from trucking companies, highway construction groups, motorists’ associations, community leaders, and state legislators from both parties.
Corbett, meanwhile, has spent the last six months diligently ignoring the situation, only indicating that he will take the commission’s input into account in his yearly budget message, due out Feb. 7.
Without Corbett’s support, any transit-related legislation stands little chance of success. If the state can’t provide a more stable funding solution, the Port Authority’s directors will be passing around the tip jar and begging for the odd million or two for the foreseeable future.
As city residents and bus riders, we should be horrified at the thought.
Fortunately, as engaged citizens, we also learned last week that our voices actually can make a difference. The same day that the Port Authority unveiled its shriveling future service, millions of young Americans were changing the federal government’s mind about the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA).
After a day of shuttered websites, concerted petition-signing, and phone calls to elected representatives, The New York Times reported Thursday that at least seven members of Congress — including some of SOPA’s original co-sponsors — had withdrawn their support from a bill they had previously regarded as uncontroversial.
Corbett needs a similar wake-up call now. The thousands of us in Pittsburgh who depend on public transit for school, work, shopping, and amusement need to make it clear that we cannot tolerate continued uncertainty in transportation funding. The Transportation Funding Advisory Commission’s recommendations already enjoy broad support outside the state capitol; they should be translated into law as quickly as possible.
They would generate $2.7 billion a year in new revenue while costing the average motorist $2.57 a week, about the price of a single trip downtown on the 61C. With the commission’s proposals in place, the Port Authority would benefit to the tune of $32 million to $48 million annually. That money won’t instantly solve all of the agency’s problems, but it would be a good start and — more importantly — a dependable source of revenue for years to come.
Corbett’s office can be reached at (717) 787-2500 or online at www.governor.state.pa.us.

They’re everywhere nowadays — sitting in coffee shops and riding their fixies around town with their oversized non-prescription glasses, tight jeans, and notable facial hair (although that’s mostly guys).
Hipsters have officially taken over Pittsburgh. At least, The Washington Post thinks they have. The paper’s article provides many reasons why Pittsburgh has surpassed Portland, Oregon as the home to hipsters. With its cheap cost of living, interesting accent, and unique places, Pittsburgh is a hipster’s dream.
But how should Pittsburgh feel to be the new home to hipsters? People have various opinions about hipsters, but there is no prominent reason to dislike or fear hipsters. “Hipsterism” is a new American subculture that has developed like the ones before it. We should embrace it. 
At first, it was an easy target for ridicule because of its counterculture lifestyle. Some people thought hipsters were obnoxious because of their seemingly meticulous effort to display a nonchalant persona, so they made fun of them. 
Then, the jokes started to die down as more people decided that it was actually cool to be a hipster. Ironically, the subculture that developed to deviate from the mainstream became the mainstream — hence  the emergence of Urban Outfitters. Now hipsterism is a hot trend just like grunge, punk, gangsta, and other fads that used to be in style.
Some people have taken “hipsterism” too seriously. Douglas Haddow, a Canadian freelance writer, claims in his essay “Hipster: The Dead End of Western Civilization” that hipsters mark the decline of civilization. It is highly improbable that a group of young adults who have an unconventional fashion sense and drink cheap beer are going to destroy centuries of societal development.
This is not the first counterculture trend to develop, and it certainly won’t be the last. In addition to the aforementioned subcultures, there were the hippies of the ’60s, the greasers of the ’50s, even the flappers of the ’20s. 
These subcultures began with a group of people wishing to create an identity apart from societal conventions and they eventually moved into the mainstream. 
In essence, each subculture evolved into a defining aspect of a certain time period. Isn’t this what we are witnessing today with hipsters? 
There is a normal cycle where, every few decades, there is a more daring and experimental generation. It is natural human progression. Being a hipster is part of today’s youth just as being hippies represented the American youth of the ’60s. We are the new generation that wants to experiment and to be more self-aware. So get ready, Pittsburgh, and love your hipsters, because no matter how weird they may be to you, the future is in their hands.

The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect IP Act (PIPA) encountered major opposition this past Wednesday in the form of massive internet protests. 
Thousands of websites responded to the proposed legislation that could grant Congress power to censor sites for hosting or linking to sites that host unlawfully uploaded copyrighted material. While the internet has always been home to activism, the scope of these protests goes far beyond other internet movements.
Wikipedia, Reddit, WordPress, and other websites ceased access to their normal sites, instead displaying pages that warned users of the effects that SOPA and PIPA could have on the state of the internet. The measures taken by these websites to protest the SOPA and PIPA legislation are a landmark for internet-based political activism. 
Awareness of SOPA and PIPA increased dramatically in a very short time period due to these protests. The amount of participation was incredible, with 7 million users utilizing Google’s forms to petition Congress. But the effect that the protests had outside of the internet is what is truly remarkable. According to propublica.org, the number of opponents of SOPA and PIPA in Congress nearly tripled Wednesday to total 101. Meanwhile, SOPA and PIPA lost 15 of their supporters in Congress over the same time period. 
The protests were successful, with representatives in the Senate and House stating on Friday that they will postpone SOPA and PIPA legislation. Yet the effect of these protests will go well beyond their purpose. This activism serves as a reminder of the power of the internet, but more importantly as a reminder of the power of people. 
Censorship legislation as extreme as SOPA and PIPA would inhibit the same kind of creativity and collaborative force that allowed for these protests to happen. 
Inhibiting access to information would make such efforts for  positive change impossible. Censorship legislation like SOPA and PIPA threaten people’s ability to use the internet to its full potential.
Last year was marked by numerous protests and movements across the world, and these blackouts continue the tradition into 2012. 
The use of the internet as a tool for positive change, on such a large scope, should be an inspiration for future activism.

Pittsburgh is heading into a dark age. 
Failed infrastructure projects, lack of tech sector growth, and mass transit cuts are just a few of the predicaments plaguing the city these days — not to mention that the population has been hemorrhaging constantly since about 1950. 
Currently on the top of the list of grievances is a planned $3.2 million of protection money taken from nonprofit organizations to keep the city’s massively unsupported pension budget afloat for another year.
Why call it “protection money”? In the face of looming budget deadlines and starved-for-revenue sources, the Pittsburgh city government elected to ask a coalition of 46 nonprofits to cough up the money in lieu of being taxed — which has “mafia” written all over it. 
There are a few major faults with this approach: Namely, why is the city considering taxing nonprofits in the first place? Instead of taking money from these institutions, the city should be attempting to grow and nurture its nonprofit base. With dozens of churches, universities, prominent hospitals, and other cultural institutions, the NPO sector is truly one of Pittsburgh’s major attractions.
At a time when the city council is trying desperately to keep graduates and young people within city bounds — even going so far as to form committees to meet that end — the council is attacking the same constructs that are potentially the only reasons left to stay in Pittsburgh at all. 
Is this an act of hypocrisy, or just a lack of foresight? It’s hard to say. What is certain is that nonprofits provide a valuable and visible impact on the communities around them; in a weak economy in which graduates struggle to find jobs, nonprofits offer them jobs and positions to kick-start their careers. 
This in turn could lead to more highly educated workers staying in the city, creating businesses of their own, and generating higher-salary jobs for other workers.
Admittedly, there are certain nonprofit organizations (NPOs) which can afford to cough up a few, especially considering that Pittsburgh’s corporate base is shriveling these days as fledgling businesses flee for the coasts. 
UPMC, Carnegie Mellon, Pitt and Duquesne are prime examples of super-powered NPOs which remain relatively untaxed. Perhaps the solution is for the city to set a floor for its taxation plans; rather than taxing smaller groups, such as YMCAs, levy a tax only on large, robust organizations which earn gross revenues above a certain limit, such as UPMC. Overall, the ultimate solution should be clearer communication for everyone involved. 
The Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority recently sent back the city’s proposal (including the nonprofit pledge amount) for further review; there has been no official discussion of a pledge total from the city’s nonprofits, and city officials have had only unofficial talks with those groups. 
If we can get these issues out into the open and have a reasonable talk about contribution, perhaps the city’s nonprofit organizations can find a healthier and more reasonable way to give back.

Many of you are probably wondering where we have been and what we have been up to, since there has been minimal product to show our progress from this past semester. For better or for worse, many of the initiatives we had hoped to complete ended up being major projects for other organizations and groups. This is great for the campus community but has made it difficult for us to figure out where to go next.
Our first priority was to revamp Parents and Family Weekend, but a month later we heard about the plans for Cèilidh Weekend. As your student body representatives, we made our best efforts to attend events and help out in every way possible. Our next mission was the shuttle system, and then we found out it was completely restructured over the summer. We are currently looking into the changes that were made and are collecting data to determine how successful they were.
Most recently, our focus was on the creation of a centralized events calendar for student organization events. 
After hours in meetings with students in Senate, staff in Student Activities, and potential programmers, we came up with the ideal model for a central calendar. Just as we were about to make progress we faced another halt. 
The Student Activities office has been searching for a potential new software system to replace the current OrgTracker and BudgetTracker. In their search, they came across a new system with a feature that serves as a central events calendar. Since the Student Activities office is still unsure whether it will be moving forward with this new program, we have decided to pause our process and not hire anyone to work on our calendar.
We should be finding out in a few weeks if Student Activities plans to move forward with this new software, and if it does not, we will keep moving forward with our original idea in hopes of launching it in the latter half of this semester.

Everyone is returning to Carnegie Mellon after the holidays. So we asked, "What's the most interesting thing you did over winter break?"

You are a new person this year, or at least that’s who you’re trying to be. Changing for the better is a good thing, but it can be difficult at times. Stay on course and you will be rewarded.
You didn’t even try to have a meaningful Martin Luther King Jr. Day, so from now on, you don’t get to celebrate any of the really good holidays. Happy National Handwriting Day!
If you decide to wear all white in the snow, don’t get upset if your friends stare in your direction and don’t acknowledge your presence. Perhaps you could wear a colorful hat or at least get some bronzer.
You’re not the most outgoing person at times, and that’s okay, but you are currently in a class where you won’t do well if you don’t speak up. Don’t let yourself get lost in the crowd.
You are completely justified in spoiling the newest episodes of a show that you and your friend both watch. If he or she didn’t catch up over the break it’s their fault, not yours.
Take some time this week to spruce up your resume. Remember, being able to get to the Waterfront via public transportation means that you are not only patient, but also a creative problem solver.
If you’re in Hunt Library after 2:30 a.m., there is no need to go the the quiet floor. If a half-empty library in the middle of winter isn’t quiet enough for you, you might want to look into renting a room at the local mortuary.
Hey, hey, stop thinking that about your professor. Everyone is entitled to a quirk or two ... or three. Okay, better yet, just try to be as understanding as possible.
It’s time to start building up your reputation around campus so that people will know and remember your name. Start small and keep at it. You’re on your way if you don’t have to place an order at The Exchange.
You don’t take horoscopes seriously and anyone can appreciate that. You try to think for yourself and live life as it happens, but sometimes the silly things in life should not be ignored.
Yes, a lot of people did just hear that awkward thing that you said to your friend when you thought no one was listening. And yes, it will be online within the hour.
What are you doing? I mean really. Why are you doing that?  What is the point?
