The Carnegie Mellon women’s volleyball team took the court in Skibo Gymnasium this weekend to compete in the Carnegie Mellon DoubleTree Invitational. The hosting Tartans dominated the tournament, winning all four matches. On Friday, the Tartans took down Bethany College with a score of 3–0 then moved on to defeat Randolph-Macon College 3–1 for an impressive opening day of the tournament.
In the first match against Bethany, the Tartans shut out their opponent, winning the first 25–20, the second 26–24, and the third and final set 25–13. Senior setter Emily Newton led the Tartan offense in the first match with 39 assists, along with senior middle blocker Jackie Gibbons who had 12 kills. Sophomore right setter Sarah Jurgens and junior middle blocker Eliza Donahue each finished the match with zero errors, and Jurgens secured nine kills, while Donahue earned seven of her own. Donahue, Newton, and Gibbons each had two block assists on top of their offensive performances. Senior libero and defensive specialist Molly Higgins anchored the defensive side for the Tartans with 16 digs.
The second match on Friday was not a complete shut out, but the Tartans proved themselves with a decisive 3–1 victory. Carnegie Mellon dropped the first set against Randolph-Macon College 25–21, but surged back to take the next three sets, each with a score of 25–19. The Tartans forced the Yellow Jackets to make too many mistakes and fall behind in each set. Gibbons found herself at the top of the offensive leaderboards again in the second match with 11 kills. Donahue had another strong performance with nine kills, while sophomore outside hitter Lauren Mueller contributed eight of her own. Newton had 33 assists in the second match to lead the team once again. 
Carnegie Mellon’s defense had an impressive showing in this match, with Higgins leading once again with 27 digs. Mueller earned 17 digs as well. Donohue had nine block assists in this match, and junior Heather Holton had five of her own.
On Saturday, the Tartans closed the tournament with two matches against the University of Mount Union and John Carroll University and won both, 3–0 and 3–1, respectively. The four victories from this tournament put the No. 17 Tartans’ overall record at 15–2 for the season.
In the first match against Mount Union, Carnegie Mellon swept their opponent with set scores of 25–19, 25–20, and 25–14. The Tartans recorded their highest hitting percentage of the season in this match at .402 along with only six errors in the entire game. Gibbons and Newton continued their precedent of leading the offense in the match. Gibbons earned 13 kills and no errors on top of a .812 hitting percentage, while Newton had 39 assists. Jurgens showed up with another strong performance in this match with nine kills, along with Mueller who had seven.
On the defensive side, Higgins earned 14 digs for the Tartans, while Gibbons and Newton each had four block assists. Donahue had two block assists of her own, along with three solo blocks.
The final match of the tournament against John Carroll University was another convincing victory for the Tartan squad. The Tartans did drop a set, but won the match 3–1 with some of their best performances of the tournament. The Tartans won the first set 25–23 before falling in the second, 28–26. The final two sets went decisively in favor the Tartans, 25–16 and 25–18. 
The offensive leaders for the Tartans put up tournament-best numbers with Newton earning 50 assists, while Gibbons recorded 19 kills, which is also a career high for her. Mueller and Holton also had impressive performances as Mueller earned 14 kills and Holton had 11.
Defensively, Higgins put 32 digs on the board to close out the tournament. First-year outside hitter and defensive specialist Kayla Yew recorded a career-best with 23 digs of her own, and Donahue had three block assists on top of two solo blocks. Gibbons also had two solo blocks and two block assists to cap the undefeated tournament for her team.
The Tartans will now move on to University Athletic Association (UAA) play, which begins next week on their home turf as they take on rival Washington University in St. Louis on Saturday, Oct. 1 at noon.

A quick note regarding this column. Pillbox Editor Abhishek Tayal was supposed to write last week’s article because of being week one’s worst loser, but extenuating circumstances prevented him from doing so. Layout Manager Zeke Rosenberg has assured me that he has been or will be properly punished, so I’ll let bygones be bygones. In the future, expect the worst loser of the week to write the article, and week two’s biggest loser was me.
A quick recap of week one. Lula Beresford escaped the ignominy of being week one’s worst loser because Tayal started a suspended player. Jade Crockem changed her team’s name to complete the pun as mentioned in the article I wrote two weeks ago, and that’s totally the reason she won. Rosenberg, Sports Editor Alex Wood, and I all won our matchups by comfortable margins. Strangely, Forum Editor Sinead Foley’s second team, which I thought would be weak, scored 141 points. Unfortunately for her, the team faced Online Editor India Price’s Plaidie Daddies, coming from behind on Monday night to total 144 points. India totally won week one in the only matchup that came down to a single digit difference. Now to recap week two.
Flaming Bears over Dreamland Warriors 123–87
As expected Rosenberg totally trounced my team. He picked up Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, Kansas City Chiefs running back Spencer Ware, and Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Cole Beasley, actively playing week one’s waiver wire. Carolina Panthers tight end Greg Olsen, Tennessee Titans running back DeMarco Murray, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans led his team to victory. On my end, the New York Giants were able to greatly limit the offense of the New Orleans Saints, causing quarterback Drew Brees and tight end Coby Fleener to severely underperform. Losing San Diego Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen for the year after week one did not help my team at all. Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald, and Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy were my star players. New England Patriots tight end Martellus Bennett taunted me from the bench with a 22-point performance, but that would not have been nearly enough to defeat Zeke’s team. The Flaming Bears are now 2–0, while my Dreamland Warriors fall to 1–1.
Mr. Rodgers’ Neighborhood over Masshole Knickerbockers 96–86
See, Jade. That pun is totally the reason your team is 2–0 right now. Actually, the real reason is because injuries destroyed Beresford’s team. Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler left the game after giving Beresford a mere two points, but the more devastating injury happened to Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson. I’m really glad I didn’t pick him in the draft because he’s now on injured reserve, meaning he won’t be able to help Beresford at all unless she somehow finds herself in the championship matchup. Strong performances by Carolina Panthers kicker Graham Gano (18 points from a kicker!), New York Jets wide receiver Brandon Marshall, and the Houston Texans defense were not enough to overcome performances from Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott, Denver Broncos wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, and the Panther defense. Beresford’s team falls to 0–2, facing an uncertain future.
McManus’s Anus over extremely dank team 155–93
Publisher Sarah Gutekunst absolutely destroyed Wood’s team. Jets running back Matt Forte, Jets wide receiver Eric Decker, Panthers wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin, and the Broncos defense each contributed over 20 points, with Forte adding a massive 30 points. The previously-named Broncos kicker Brandon McManus had a strong 14-point showing that helped give Gutekunst’s team the highest single game point total thus far in the season. For Wood, Panthers quarterback Cam Newton did the team proud, but when his passes were largely going to Benjamin, the 29 points he amassed were completely neutralized. Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant was the only other player to score double digits for Wood. The news only got worse. Chargers running back Danny Woodhead suffered an ACL injury that took him out for the season. I had him pegged as a potentially great contributer for Wood’s team, but now he’ll have to forge ahead without the dual running and receiving threat. Both teams are now 1–1.
Minaj And Co. over Team Foley 136–101
Tayal took control of his team, gave it a name, and managed to dominate against last week’s highest scoring loser in Foley’s second team. For Tayal, Oakland Raiders running back Latavius Murray, Cleveland Browns running back Isaiah Crowell, Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones, and Miami Dolphins wide receiver Jarvis Landry each contributed 21 points, already enough to beat Foley’s team. Foley, like some of the other losers this week, had a player get injured: Panthers running back Jonathan Stewart. She’ll need to shuffle her team’s players if she wants to start winning (though in fairness, she would have beaten any other team week one besides India’s team). Tayal’s Minaj And Co. are now 1–1, while Team Foley falls to 0–2.
Team Foley over Plaidie Daddies 101–87
In a reversal of last week, Tayal’s first team defeated India’s team. Foley has the Cardinals to thank, as their dominant performance against the Buccaneers gave her a 24-point performance from quarterback Carson Palmer and a 22-point showing from the defense. One thing Foley should note going forward is Vikings wide receiver Stefon Diggs. 
After scoring 17 points in week one and 33 points in week two, he probably shouldn’t be on her bench. On Price’s side, the same team that got her 144 points last week only scored 87 points this week. Pittsburgh Steelers running back DeAngelo Williams, Titans tight end Delanie Walker, and Broncos running back C.J. Anderson were her top contributors, but her laggards sunk her chances of victory. 
Steelers kicker Shaun Suisham earned her no points since he was injured, and she needs to replace him ASAP. The Raiders defense is a terrible unit: scoring negative points for the second week in a row. Admittedly, they have a matchup this week that keeps them tolerable, but she needs to drop them for another defense as well. 
Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver A.J. Green will not be held to single digit performances every week, so his weak performance against the Steelers is nothing for India to worry about. She should, however, consider benching Broncos wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders in favor of Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Mike Wallace, who scored 19 points in week one and 20 points in week two. Price has the pieces for a good team, but she needs to make some moves in order to win consistently. Both teams are now 1–1.
Heading into week three, Rosenberg’s team and Crockem’s team are both 2–0. Rosenberg’s team seems poised to ascend further, after stealing Chargers running back Melvin Gordon from Tayal’s team in exchange for Ware. However, Wood’s team is poised to significantly challenge Rosenberg, especially after picking up Seattle Seahawks running back Christine Michael. The matchup between two of the strongest teams should prove to be interesting.
Elsewhere, I’m fairly certain I won’t be writing next week’s article. I’ve added Jets wide receiver Quincy Enunwa and Chargers wide receiver Tyrell Williams to my roster. Of course, Beresford is still in it against me after picking up Chargers quarterback Phillip Rivers, but she hasn’t yet slotted anyone to replace Peterson on her team.
Foley’s second team got up to a 24–0 lead over Sarah’s team after the Patriots defense eliminated the need to overexert tight end Rob Gronkowski’s return to the field. Still, Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck is questionable to play, Chargers tight end Antonio Gates is questionable, and Stewart is out. Since Foley doesn’t look like she’s going to make changes at all and Sarah’s starters are all completely healthy, I suspect that Sarah will mount a comeback.
Price’s team got off to a 14–0 lead over Crockem’s team, and she is projected to win her matchup by nine points. Of course, things would be better for India if she changed her defense and kicker, but things might still be fine for this week.
Lastly, Tayal’s team is poised to win against Foley’s first team, especially since Bills head coach Rex Ryan believes “odds probably not real good that [wide receiver Sammy Watkins] plays.” If Foley were to slot in Diggs for Watkins, she would be more likely to win over Tayal’s team.It’s hard to tell where most of these teams will be headed in the future. While Rosenberg and Wood are both clearly poised for winning, other teams have murkier fates. I would say that Gutekunst, Price, and I have some of the better teams, but that would discount Tayal’s week two performance and Foley’s two teams. Crockem may be 2–0, but that record isn’t nearly as solid as Rosenberg’s. Beresford is in danger most since she doesn’t have anyone lined up who can replace Peterson’s production at running back. Still, it is entirely too early to call it game over for anyone.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team faced off against Baldwin Wallace College on Tuesday, Sept. 20. The Tartans defeated the home team Yellow Jackets 2–0 in a convincing victory.
Carnegie Mellon applied heavy pressure to their opponents from the start, putting seven shots on goal early in the game. Despite the Tartans’ aggression, the game remained scoreless until the 37th minute. First-year forward Sydney Webber assisted the goal with a corner kick, and from that corner kick first-year defender Camille Williams collected the ball and fired a hard shot that connected with the back of the net, earning her first career score and putting the Tartans up 1–0 and finally capitalizing on their aggression.
Not only were the Tartans aggressive on offense, but their stout defense prohibited the Yellow Jackets from getting anywhere near the goal. In the first 18 minutes of the game, sophomore goalkeeper Sarah Mahler made three saves and effectively shut down any further attempt to score by the home team.
The second and final goal of the game for the Tartans came in the 73rd minute, once again assisted by Webber. First-year forward Vayda Farino scored the first goal of her career off of Webber’s assist, and that goal would end up securing the win for the Tartans. Junior forward Haili Adams attempted a shot with less than a minute left in the game, but a defender got in the way and the shot was denied. Still the Tartans ended the game with two goals for themselves and a shut out for the other team, so they can be proud. This win marks Mahler's second shut out of the season, as well as her fourth win.
On Friday Sept. 23, the Tartans traveled to Ohio to battle John Carroll University. The teams fought hard, and the Tartans looked to be in control for the whole game, but the match ended in a 1–1 tie. 
John Carroll struck first early in the game, putting a shot past Mahler in the 14th minute. This mistake did not deter the Tartans at all though. They kept pushing toward the opposing goal, even making four shots on goal in the first period only to be denied by the Blue Streaks goalkeeper. 
The Tartans continued to send shots at the opposing goal, but nothing was connecting with the back of the net. The John Carroll goalkeeper denied another four shots before the Tartans finally tied the game with their first score in the 84th minute. Adams stepped up for the Tartans and fired a shot to the goal. It went past the John Carroll goalkeeper, a rare sight in this game, and the Tartans made the score 1–1.
The Tartans were persistent in their attack for the rest of the game, but the opposing goalkeeper would not let another score through. Junior midfielder Tori Iatarola made two attempts to score in the final two minutes of the game but neither was successful, and the teams went into overtime play.
In the overtime period, stellar goalkeeping by both teams kept the score at a standstill. Senior midfielder Delaney Lam and junior forward Sienna Stritter each made a shot on goal in overtime, but Lam’s shot was saved by the John Carroll goalkeeper and Stritter’s was blocked by a defender.
First-year goalkeeper Andrea Sipos earned the decision for the Tartans after she entered the game for Mahler in the 67th minute.
While they did not lose, the Tartans surely wanted more out of their performance. The opposing goalkeeper refused to let the Tartan offense get rolling and ended the game with 11 saves. This tie is the first of the season for the Tartans, but next week they will look to get a solid victory as they host University Athletic Association (UAA) opponent Brandeis University on Saturday, Oct. 1. The game is scheduled to start at 11 a.m.

Football
The Carnegie Mellon football team traveled to Thomas More College on Saturday and fell to the 18th-ranked home team, 20–16. Thomas More scored 13 points in the first quarter, and the scoring went unanswered by the Tartans until a field goal in the second quarter. Thomas More scored another touchdown in the third, and the Tartans tried to come back but could only manage two field goals in the final quarter of the game. Tartan quarterback sophomore Alex Cline had 242 passing yards on the day along with one touchdown, but he threw four interceptions that proved very problematic. Star running back junior Sam Benger could not produce his normal level of success and finished the game with only 55 rushing yards. Juniors John Prather and Tommy Mansfield led the receiving core for the Tartans with 71 and 73 yards, respectively.
Defensively, the Tartans showed promise but could not stifle the Thomas More offense well enough to get the win. Senior Aaryn Watson and junior Kyle Brittain stepped up in the secondary and both had an interception. In the trenches, seniors Ben Winebrake and Jack Fagan each recorded a sack. Senior Samer Abdelmoty and junior Stanley Bikulege each had a career-best 12 tackles on the day.
This loss puts the Tartans at 1–2 for the season, but they will look to get their second win next week when they play on home turf as they take on Bethany College. The game will take place on Saturday, Oct. 1 at 6 p.m.
Men’s Soccer
The Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team traveled to Grove City College on Friday and suffered their first loss of the season, 2–1. The Tartans scored first in the 21st minute with a goal from sophomore Anthony Gulli for his second of the season. Grove City tied the match at 1–1 in the 39th minute. The Tartans kept putting shots on goal in the second half, but the Wolverine defense proved to be too much. The Tartans gave Grove City the lead in the 85th minute with an own goal and the game ended soon after with the Tartans falling for the first time this season.
The Tartans will take the field again on Saturday, Oct. 1 at home against Brandeis University as they try to get back to their winning ways. The game is scheduled to start at 1:30 p.m.
Women’s Tennis
The Carnegie Mellon women’s tennis team began the United States Tennis Association-Intercollegiate Tennis Association (USTA-ITA) Regional Championships on Saturday. Four Tartans advanced to the round of 16, and one doubles pair moved on to quarterfinals. Senior Nicholle Torres moved on in singles play after winning both matches, along with junior teammates Cori Siddell and Katie Lai who also swept their matches on the day. Sophomore Jamie Vizelman also advanced in singles play for the Tartans, and the pair of Torres and Siddel advanced in doubles. The tournament runs through Monday, September 26.

Magnetic bacteria may be next cancer breakthrough
In the journey to develop a nano-carrier to deliver tumor-fighting drugs, researchers of the Polytechnique Montréal NanoRobotics Laboratory may have discovered a natural means to effectively transport the drugs — magnetic bacteria called magnetococcus marinus. These bacteria have the potential to overcome the challenges that other artificial bio-chemical nanocarriers face, including the ability to naturally navigate to areas with low oxygen levels, which is the defining characteristic of where metastasis, or division of cancer cells, occurs. This will allow for more drugs to reach the tumor and hopefully slow down the rate of metastasis. The research team has conducted preliminary tests on mice and rats, and the results have been promising. The findings have been published in the August 2016 issue of Nature Nanotechnology.

Gaia measures speed of universe expansion
The value of the expansion rate of the universe, as reported by the Gaia space telescope, is much faster than what scientists expected. This is not the first time that telescopes have proposed this, but Gaia’s findings are significant because its measurements are regarded to be the most precise. If Gaia’s observations are correct, the timescale scientists currently have of the universe will be reduced by a few hundred million years. Furthermore, Gaia has the potential to be revolutionary in the quest to determine the Hubble Constant which defines the relationship between the distance of galaxies and how the wavelength of the light stretches. The Hubble Constant is the key to finding the rate at which the cosmos is expanding, and Gaia, once it completes its orbit in 2019, should have the ability to measure the Hubble Constant to a precision of 1 percent.

Plastic developed that can move like a caterpillar
A research lab at the University of Warsaw created a new “robot caterpillar” out of plastic that is half an inch long, a few millimeters wide, and as thin as human hair. When exposed to green laser light, it begins to move across a surface by undulating like a caterpillar and can carry up to ten times its weight. The type of plastic used contains liquid crystalline elastomers, and the lasers cause it to move by altering the shape of the molecules in the plastic. The purpose of this creation was to explore a field of robots without using wires and batteries and other seemingly essential hardware. Currently, there are no practical applications of this mini robot caterpillar, but the aim is to begin a new thought process in robotics that strays away from the traditional wire-battery-motor scheme. This technology is promising.

Tropical dry forests are important, unprotected habitats
Although tropical dry forests are home to many species not found elsewhere in the world, few are protected from deforestation. For example, while almost ten percent of the Amazon rainforest is fully protected, only one percent of the Caatinga dry forest in northern Brazil is under protection. The range of tropical dry forests has diminished to ten percent of what it used to be, due to their ideal conditions for growing cash crops. A team from the Latin America and Caribbean Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest Floristic Network claims that these trees’ abilities to adapt to heat and drought should make tropical dry forest conservation a global priority in light of global warming. The next step for this team is raising awareness in Latin American communities in the hopes of catching the attention of the policymakers.

Extinct reptile species resembles dinosaurs
Paleontologists have identified a new species of reptile, Triopticus primus, from before the age of dinosaurs — an estimated 230 million years ago. After CT scanning, paleontologists found that the Triopticus primus’ skull bears a resemblance both externally and internally to that of the dome-headed Pachycephalosaurus dinosaurs, like the Stegoceras. This discovery of distantly related animals — and in this case, 150 million years’ worth of distance — resembling each other is called convergence. Originally, paleontologists believed that many of the dinosaurs’ features were unique, but they are beginning to uncover many fossils of reptiles that resemble those supposedly “unique” body shapes. Researchers have stated that the discovery of the convergence of so many different reptiles in the same area is extremely rare, making this an even more interesting finding.

Bourbon inspires scientists to use fire to clean oil spill
Three scientists from the University of Maryland were inspired by a video of burning bourbon to apply a fire whirl, or tornado of fire, to oil spills. During their research, the scientists found that fire whirls are efficient in burning fuel, but produce soot to give the fire a yellow color. However, during the experiments, the fire whirl quickly turned blue. In addition, the fire whirl was even more efficient and did not produce any soot. They do not know why the vortex turned blue at this point in their research and have not found any evidence that suggests other reports of blue fire whirls, but they will attempt to recreate the blue “firenado” at an even larger scale to hopefully combat future oil spills.

Nine years ago, at a keynote address, an excited Steve Jobs unveiled his company’s latest invention to the world — a black and silver, rectangular, touch-screen phone. That device, called the iPhone, revolutionized the personal computing market. Today, touch-screen technology is indispensable. People use it to check their mail, swipe through holiday photos, scroll past endless selfies on Instagram, and catch Pokémon. But, how does it actually work? How does a glass screen respond to touch and make the device perform?
There are many different types of touch-screens. The technology varies between devices and manufacturers, and many factors ultimately determine which version is chosen. Nevertheless, they all detect the same thing: user stimulus. There are three main types of touch screens: capacitive, resistive, and super acoustic. This article discusses capacitive touch screens, because that is what almost all mainstream smartphones use.
The uppermost surface of a capacitive touch screen is made of an insulating material, such as glass. 
This glass surface is coated with a thin layer of a transparent conductor. An electric charge is stored in this conductor, establishing an electrostatic field across the surface. Unlike those in a circuit, the electrons supplied to the screen have nowhere to flow. The difference in this electric potential energy, which makes electrons flow from one location to another, is called electric potential difference. These electrons build up, creating stored charge across the display. When a user touches the screen, the amassed electrons finally have a place to flow to — the finger. The finger reduces the charge at that point on the screen, and so the charge and capacitance — the ratio of charge to potential difference — at that point are reduced to lower than the rest of the screen. These charges are very small, which is why you are not jolted with a shock whenever you interact with your phone, which would be extremely inconvenient and detract from the user’s experience.Circuits along the edges of the touch screen detect these minute differences in capacitance and pinpoint their locations in xy coordinates. The information is sent to a processor, which interprets the user’s touch as a specific command.
Touch screens specifically work with fingers and skin because the human body conducts electricity, which is why when your phone is in your pocket the touch screen is not reacting to your every movement. In addition, as you have probably noticed, it is much more difficult to use your phone with gloves on. The fabrics gloves are made of are usually insulators, so they draw no charge off the screen and no touch is detected. However, special gloves are sold with material to help conduct electricity.
Touch screens provide numerous benefits to the producer and the consumer. Most noticeably, they eliminate the need for buttons. Buttons are easily damaged or jammed, and they reduce the waterproof capabilities of a device. 
Fewer buttons allow more space for large displays, which are crucial aspects of the user experience. Most importantly, touch screens allow users to interact naturally with the user interface (think pinch-to-zoom, swiping, scrolling, and 3D Touch), improving device usability drastically. 
Touch technology has come a long way since 2007, and is continuously evolving. Today, researchers at Carnegie Mellon are developing EM-Sense, a technology that lets a user’s smartwatch know what object they are touching or holding, which could create a new era of context aware apps. The Future Interfaces Group (FIG) of the Human-Computer Interactions Institute has developed SkinTrack. SkinTrack turns the arm into an extended touch screen and allows the user to use the human body as a touch screen. In the future, as science aims to make human and machine interaction more natural, touch screens will require minimum screen ‘touch.’ It could be replaced by gesture tracking, voice recognition, etc., evident by Google ATAP’s Project Soli, which uses a miniature radar system, built into a smartwatch to track touchless gestures. 
Touch screen technology has changed the way we interact with technology for the better, and continues to define and enrich the interaction of people and machines. But most importantly, the next time you pull out your phone and swipe to unlock, you’ll know how it all works.

Often referred to as the future of computing, quantum computing is based on exploiting the laws of quantum mechanics to transfer information using ‘qubits’. At the International Conference on Quantum Cryptography (QCrypt), held on Sept. 12, at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., several research teams presented their findings in the field of quantum computing.
‘Qubits,’ or quantum bits, are the smallest unit of information in a quantum computer. They store data that is traditionally binary in the form of two distinguishable quantum states. The general principle behind storing information is that these quantum bits have properties like superposition and entanglement. Superposition is the ability of these qubits to have more than a single state at the same time, which means that, in the case of an electron, it is possible for it to be in the ‘up’ and ‘down’ state at once. Entanglement is the inexplicable phenomenon of quantum particles to be in ‘sync’ with each other, even at great distances. 
However, the existence of a fully functional quantum computer is still years away. This is because of the fact that it is a significant challenge to make qubits behave in a certain way when even the slightest disturbance causes qubits to fall out of their state. Another concern is that even though they have entanglement states at larger distances, those distances are finite and information needs to be repeated after some threshold value when using physical transfer methods. In free space, less information is lost, scattered, or absorbed.
A group of researchers from the University of Calgary in Canada reported that they had transferred quantum states successfully over a distance of 6.2 km using three spaced out stations — A, B, and C — to send states from A to C using the Calgary fiber network. One of the interesting things that the report notes is that, even though they send disembodied quantum states from A to B, B doesn’t receive any physical particle, but still sends out photons in entanglement states. Another team reports the construction of a 30 km optical fiber-based quantum network distributed over a 12.5 km area in the city of Hefei, China. According to the report, the network is as completely robust in the real world scenario and employed stabilization strategies. Both of these findings were published in Nature Photonics on Sept. 19. 
A research team from the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands developed a system of quantum memory using quantum entanglement of electrons in diamond chips. Moving the entanglement of electrons to atomic nuclei protects the states, which is a rule that could potentially be used to expand the range of quantum networks, according to a scientist on the team. 
As research teams continue to work on quantum computing, they find better ways to control quantum bits and make stronger, larger, more functional quantum networks.  Quantum computing could revolutionize computing simply because it is so much faster than traditional methods. One way to think about this is that factoring large numbers, which is one of the slowest calculations that traditional computers do, could be done in a significantly shorter, more feasible time. 
Furthermore, entanglement allows researchers to know when the data is being modified or accessed, because tweaking one qubit allows another that is far away to also change, which security systems can catch and relate to unauthorized access. Thus, another benefit of quantum computing is that it allows for better security of data transfer.

Whether it is birthday cards or smiley faces drawn in the margins of our notebooks, getting personalized messages makes us feel special and brightens up our day. New studies show that getting these messages in digital form is just as powerful as getting them in person. In particular, Facebook offers a prime platform for sending and receiving personalized messages. 
However, personalized messages must be more than simply reading or “liking” a post in order to compare to the intensity of the feelings we would get if these messages were received in person.  “We’re not talking about anything that’s particularly labor-intensive,” said Moira Burke, a research scientist on the data science team at Facebook, in a university press release. “This can be a comment that’s just a sentence or two. The important thing is that someone such as a close friend takes the time to personalize it. The content may be uplifting, and the mere act of communication reminds recipients of the meaningful relationships in their lives.”One of the most successful activities Facebook has developed in this regard is notifying friends about your birthday on Facebook and allowing them to write on your wall. Comments such as “Happy Birthday!” remind us of our meaningful relationships, and comments that include personalized photo collages make us feel just as good as if we received a card in person.
Burke earned a Ph.D. in human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon in 2011. Her research interests include bridging computer science and social psychology, specifically large-scale computational analysis of social patterns in online communities. Burke teamed up with Robert Kraut, Burke’s Ph.D advisor and the Herbert A. Simon Professor of Human-Computer Interaction in the School of Computer Science and Tepper School of Business, to investigate how personalized messages impact people’s psychological well-being. Kraut, who began his career as a social psychologist, has a broad research interest in the design and social impact of information technologies in in the home, small groups, and in organizations.
In their most recent study, the pair of researchers examined 60 comments from close friends in a month and found that the positive comments correlated to an increase in the user’s psychological well-being as large as those feelings were associated with major life events such as getting married, having a child, or getting a  promotion at work. According to the study’s abstract, “An extensive literature shows that social relationships influence psychological well-being, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We test predictions about online interactions and well-being made by theories of belongingness, relationship maintenance, relational investment, social support, and social comparison.” 
The study, entitled “The Relationship Between Facebook Use and Well-Being Depends on Communication Type and Tie Strength Authors” was published by the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication in late July, and the research was supported by the National Science Foundation and Google. These findings contrast with many previous studies, which used opt-in user surveys to determine that spending more time on social media correlates to depression or loneliness. Kraut said in a university press release, “You’re left to wonder — is it that unhappy people are using social media, or is social media affecting happiness?” As opposed to previous studies, which used user surveys, Burke and Kraut’s study used Facebook logs to examine real activity over a period of months. The 1,910 participants of the study were all volunteers from across 91 countries, and their information was analyzed aggregately as opposed to individually. 
Using the logs, which are more accurate than user surveys, Burke and Kraut could differentiate between different types of activity on Facebook, including posts, passive reading, liking, and commenting. 
The researchers could also determine whether the activity was associated with a user’s close friend or mere acquaintance. “It turns out that when you talk with a little more depth on Facebook to people you already like, you feel better,” Kraut said. “That also happens when people talk in person.” “This suggests that people who are feeling down may indeed spend more time on social media, but they choose to do so because they’ve learned it makes them feel better,” Burke said. “They’re reminded of the people they care about in their lives.”
The users of the study also took monthly surveys regarding mood and behavior, and by considering these attributes over time, Burke and Kraut were able to determine that personalized Facebook interactions predicted improvements in user psychological well-being, including an increase in satisfaction with life and happiness, as well as a decrease in loneliness and depression.Since the participants of the study were all volunteers, there was no random assignment involved, which, in a typical case, may cause invalidation of the results. In addition, many of the participants were older and had larger networks than typical Facebook users. 
However, the study’s examination of social media interactions over time and psychological well-being sets up a research method that is more reliable than one-time user surveys. In the study’s abstract, the researchers say, “Specific uses of the site were associated with improvements in well-being: Receiving targeted, composed communication from strong ties was associated with improvements in well-being while viewing friends’ wide-audience broadcasts and receiving one-click feedback were not. These results suggest that people derive benefits from online communication, as long it comes from people they care about and has been tailored for them.”
In the study’s discussion, they say, “Our research derived predictions from five complementary theories about how social interaction on Facebook should affect changes in individuals’ psychological well-being. It provides evidence that the effects depend on the nature of the communication and the relationship between communicators. Receiving more personalized communication—targeted, composed text—from strong ties was linked to improvements in well-being.” In the study’s conclusion, they say, “Specific uses of the site were associated with improvements in well-being: Receiving targeted, composed communication from strong ties was associated with improvements in well-being while viewing friends’ wide-audience broadcasts and receiving one-click feedback were not. These results suggest that people derive benefits from online communication, as long it comes from people they care about and has been tailored for them.”
Getting personalized messages makes us feel like someone out there cares, and whether that happens in person or on social media, the effect is the same. So next time you’re scrolling through Facebook, make sure to drop an encouraging comment on your friend’s page. It can go a long way.

Wearable technology adds a level of convenience to life which people have never had before. Objects like Fitbits and smartwatches allow people to have all the computing power packed into smartphones and laptops without ever having to reach into their pockets. This advantage  can even extend beyond wearables. Companies like John Dewere have smart tractors that collect data from a farmer’s daily activities. Such objects combined are called the “Internet of Things,” (IoT) - the network of everyday objects with internet connectivity.
However, the IoT comes at a cost. A Fitbit is able to track a user’s location and other portable technologies can track things like search history. This transfer of data comes with some risks to users that are not immediately obvious. Other technology becomes so invasive or necessary that we either ignore or cannot react to potential hazards.One of the first things that always gets mentioned when our ubiquitous technology comes up is that we are losing our humanity to the tech. This concern haunts a lot of people but it never really exits the realm of sleepover philosophy.
Maybe smartphones are slowly eating away at our free will, but they also create so many possibilities that they completely overwhelm that sentiment. Our technology doesn’t control us, we control our technology and the tool becomes a constant in our lives. Whether or not this creates some sort of murkiness where we end and where the phone begins is not a major concern in the continued creation and use of internet connected objects. A more pressing concern is how much power over our daily activities we are relinquishing to companies. 
The IoT relies on internet connectivity, meaning it relies on the support of its applications. When Nest, an Alphabet subsidiary, shut down its smarthome hub, the object became useless. This shows that companies have the power to discontinue a network reliant device immediately, but they can also take individual users off of a device. If a company does not like how you use their product, they can now take it away from you. If you sit on a chair backwards, you’re using it wrong, but the chair company cannot restrict your access. This power gives companies a lot of influence over exactly how their product is used which could have unforeseen consequences.
Furthermore, data privacy could be a significant concern. Almost no one reads the terms of agreement when they begin to use a new piece of software. This causes problems now, but when the data you turn over becomes exponentially larger, there are more opportunities for this to be destructive. Also, the company begins to own data that you created, but don’t have access to. Those aforementioned John Deere tractors collected data and sold it to third parties without the knowledge or consent of the farmers. The information might not have been personal, but the farmer put the labor into collecting that data and saw no return from its sale. 
This doesn’t even consider the possibility of hacking.  If someone steals your IoT data with malicious intent, it could open everything from your bank account to your house to attacks. Even items like pacemakers, which will kill people if they fail to operate reliably and correctly, could be targeted by hackers. The IoT could be the most important technological development of our lives, but we have to be careful going forward to make sure that it is a force for good and not a necessity that leaves us vulnerable.

How do you present yourself and your artwork in five minutes? Sixteen masters students from the Carnegie Mellon School of Art had to answer this question PechaKucha style round robin this past Friday night. A large audience comprised primarily of professors and students from the School of Art sat below in anticipation. One by one, students went up on stage to give a presentation. Some students followed a structure reminiscent of a college application portfolio review or a lecture, beginning their five minutes by eloquently describing the moments and questions that sparked their research or the major themes as images of their work appeared on screen. Others approached their presentations with refreshing informality.
MFA '17 student, Moses Williams walks onto the stage and grabs a small kitchen chair tucked to the side of the stage and sits down. He begins to describe a memory probably shared by most people in the audience — playing kickball with his sister and the neighborhood kids. Williams then hunches over, rolls up his black pants just past the knee and pushes his sleeves up to the elbow. Then his story no longer feels commonplace. His mother frantically called the children in from the street and informed them she was going to the hospital with their youngest sister whose finger was slammed so hard by the bathroom door it was about to fall off. Williams then grabs a tub; maybe shaving cream or gesso? It's lard. Slipping through his fingers, Williams applies a thick layer of lard onto his legs as he begins the next part of his story. In a moment so still, yet transcendent, he describes standing in front of the mirror in his parents' room sobbing while redefining the part in his hair over and over and over again. He ends by asking the audience to join him in a call-and-repeat song, and the first line, “For seven years I’ve loved” echoes throughout the room transforming into a shared dialogue. The song soon ends. Williams quietly gets up, exits the stage, and suggests that someone else controls the powerpoint. The audience chuckles. 
MFA '19 student, Nick Crockett is up next. He quickly goes through slides of his work explaining to the audience that he has a new game for them that will be more interesting than the powerpoint. He talks about games as a way to reframe the world, a medium he considers closer to dance and theater than film. Then he lands on the slide the whole room is waiting for, a yellow flashing gif that reads new game. Two people come up on stage, introduce themselves, and Crockett reads them the objective: the first player to kiss their opponent on the forehead is the winner. The audience roars as the two players begin an awkward tango, grabbing at one another’s knees and backs trying to get them to sink down into an optimal forehead-kissing position.
MFA '17 student, Lee Webster runs up on stage cheering and soon telling the audience about the process of getting into Carnegie Mellon’s competitive MFA program and her life as an orphan. She alternates between three slides: the first is solid black, applause in bold, blue text is written at the bottom of the second slide, laughter in bold, and orange font replaces applause in the third slide. Ironically the audience does not know exactly how to respond, even though Webster projects the laughter slide after stating both her parents are dead. After introducing herself she acknowledges that the audience is probably ready to see her work. Webster fills the remainder of her time with various laughs and exits the stage. Many do not know what to think, still the entire room is mystified and captivated by Webster in the span of five minutes. I overhear two students whispering at the end of the lecture, “I heard that Lee is actually really quiet.” 
I went into this presentation thinking I would make an infographic with brief summaries about each MFA student. After witnessing lectures that felt more like a series of stories and calculated first impressions, it became clear summaries would be incomplete at best. Look out for their upcoming shows and expect to be challenged, humored, and impressed by the artists in the MFA program.
The MFA candidates are Shobun Baile, Kevin Brophy, Brittany DeNigris, Hannah Epstein, Lee Webster, Alex Lukas, Adam Milner,Katie Rose Pipkin, Joy Poulard, Gray Swartzel, Moses Williams, Paper Buck, Nick Crockett, Shohei Katayama, Erin Mallea, and Jisoo Yeo.

When someone says Kanye West, what comes to mind? Visionary? Icon? Coolest man alive? We’d argue that all of those are correct. There isn’t anyone else more fascinating on this whole planet; don’t fight us on this. Which is why on Sept. 18 at exactly 8:23 a.m., when he finally made an Instagram and uploaded a picture, we were elated, to say the least. Kanye is a complex man and this picture could mean anything, but we’ve narrowed it down to three schools of thought.
One: He’s going to drop a surprise album called Lines. There are a lot of straight lines in the picture, so it only makes sense.
Two: It’s the beginning of his presidential campaign. The White House is his for the taking in 2020.
Three: North took the picture when they accidentally left her somewhere ... again.
If you love Kanye as much as Kanye loves Kanye, then you know that Kanye loves being mysteriously deep for seemingly no reason at all. So it only makes sense that he would make his Instagram debut with a screenshot of a dramatic scene from a sci-fi flick circa 1990 — Total Recall. We must admit, we did do a little research on this movie to uncover what sort of motives Kanye might have for posting the photo. Maybe he's trying to let us know that he's calling a total recall on The Life of Pablo as a means of making way for a surprise new album. And maybe this surprise new album will echo the futuristic vibe of Total Recall.  Maybe (hopefully) he's calling a total recall on Yeezy Season 4, because truthfully we're not sure how many more ripped sweaters in various shades of nude and army green we can handle. 
Next is the very real possibility that Kanye West will run for President of the United States in 2020, because apparently anybody is allowed to run nowadays. Kanye's Oval Office plans date back to the 2015 VMA's when he himself declared that "[he has decided] in 2020 to run for president." Perhaps Instagram presented itself to 'Ye as another way for him to gain momentum as a legitimate candidate. Although it's going to take him a while to match Kim's 83.3 million followers, Kanye's leap to over 1 million Instagram followers in just under five days is nothing to laugh at. But the question still persists, why the [Total Recall] reference? Let's just hope he got consent to use the photo before Kim has to take to Twitter to defend Ye's honor via Snapchat video.
Unsurprisingly, this isn't the first time we've been confused by the Instagram usage of the West Family. Throwback to late last year when young North West was accused of posting a very flattering picture of Kim while playing games on her mom's phone. She seems to be very tech-savvy for such a young age. Could we possibly be looking out for her application to Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science someday? Is North the culprit in this latest blunder? Can we expect an Instagram account from her next? Will Kanye soon shift the blame onto his young daughter? Only time will tell.
There are a number of reasons that Kanye could've chosen this picture as his inaugural Instagram post. After weighing the above options and exploring all of the various camps in this argument, we feel that we have reached the only logical conclusion. Judging from the obscure choice in photo, lack of profile picture, and absence of a caption, we have concluded that Kanye West might just not know how to use Instagram.

How I’ve met people over the past few weeks: Often times, the other person will start off the conversation with: 
“Hey! You’re in my (insert course name) class, right?” 
“Do I know you from somewhere? I think we met at Playfair or something.”
“Oooh you’re in (insert name of school)??? Me too!!!” 
Then follows: 
“So what’s your major?”
“Oh, I’m (insert name) by the way. And what’s your name?”
“Cool! Where are you staying? I live in Mudge.” 
(Because somehow 90 percent of the people I’ve met are from Mudge House). 
Introductions to new people in college have become predictable. I have no idea how exactly that came to be, but it just did. Whenever I meet a new person, the same topics or questions will come up. And after speaking with him/her there’s usually a 50/50 chance that I’ll ever talk to or even see this person again. I’m not saying that the predictability is a bad thing; it’s actually made the whole process of meeting people easier for me. I just find general introductions in college very weird. 
So far, introducing myself to new people has honestly been an easier introduction to give than other kinds. There’s this template that I can now follow for meeting people on campus. On the other hand, for introductions to new areas, schedules, or classes (for example), I have to just hope for the best. I never know what to expect. Like this one time, when the buses stopped running in some part of Pittsburgh and I had to find another route back to campus. Or the times between classes where I use a different entrance into Doherty and I spend most of the ten minutes navigating the hallways to my find my lecture hall. As a new first year, you’ll find so many instances where you’ll have to think fast and act. We’re often thrown into taking risks and stepping out of our comfort zones, which may make the entire college experience for us weird at the moment. 
Back in high school I was so accustomed to the much smaller school community, where I knew every student and teacher’s name. Taking risks seemed to be much easier in that environment because I could easily find someone, whom I knew well, to help me if necessary. After coming to Carnegie Mellon, which has an undergraduate population of about six thousand students, I’ve found it a bit harder to find people I know who would help me if I needed it. I don’t know many people in general at the moment anyway. But that’s where my “introducing myself to new people” template comes in handy. 
No matter what stage in life, introductions will always be hard to deal with. They force people to encounter unknown areas, during both convenient and the most inconvenient times. But it’s after getting through the introductions where you can find the most rewarding things. As a first year who still needs to become accustomed to the Carnegie Mellon community, I know for a fact that there’s a lot of look forward to. Even though I may feel weird now, I’ll eventually get to that point where I’ll start to feel more at home.

Dear Sarah,
Normally it really bugs me that J. K. Rowling can't shut up and just leave the [ITAL]Harry Potter[ITAL] series alone for Dumbledore's sake, but last week I made an exception. She released the Patronus test, getting me where I'm weak: Internet quizzes.
I had a near heart attack when I saw the buzz on Facebook. I scrambled to reset my Pottermore password (the neurons that housed that memory are long dead), then I answered each unnerving question with bated breath, oohing and ahhing at the on-point AF visuals. 
As I flew through the woods toward my result, I had good vibes. I knew I was going to be something amazing, like a unicorn or a snow leopard or a phoenix.
Except then I turned the final corner, and there I saw a rat. A. Rat. What am I supposed to make of this? Rowling didn't even give descriptions!
Sure, I shared the Pizza Rat video with the caption "lol relatable," but, as far as I was concerned, pizza is the only thing I have in common with rats. Then I started reflecting. What if I really am a rat? I am kind of conniving and gossipy. It's not like I'm a snitch, but I have spilled a few secrets. 
I love cheese more than almost any other food in the world. If I saw it on a neck-snapping device I would probably at least try to get a nibble. Also my hygiene could be better. I could cause a plague, who knows? Have I been living my life under the illusion that I'm a mystical creature, only to realize that I'm basically a bottom feeder? Is this what growing up is?
Fretfully,
Refusing to Accept The Results Of Negative Ugly Shit
Dear Ratronus,
Rats get a bad rap. As a lifelong rodent advocate, I want us to dispel these myths, for your peace of mind, and for rats everywhere.
Science has exonerated rats in the spread of the plague, so you can forget that. Rats aren't nearly as dirty as common perception leads us to believe.
As animals, they're not quite as evil and villainous as we think they are either. Rats are very intelligent, playful, social animals that actually make wonderful companions. They can actually be trained to respond to their names! Just think of a tiny dog with a super long tail. Isn't that better?
I, too, was frustrated with Rowling for not even taking the time to give us insight into what these obscure patronus results mean (I got vulture and was also offended), so I took to Google. Luckily, Quotev user sixbhn wrote an article to make sense of this madness. In regards to rats, Sixbhn tells us, "Ambitious, social adaptable. Rat people tend to be creative, intelligent, impulsive and ostentatious."
Those are pretty good traits. Nimbleness in all parts of life is an enviable strength!
But IRL, internet quizzes are super fun trash. Remember this. Sure, it's fun to learn more about the you that the quiz perceives you to be, but keep in mind that they are absolutely made up. Maybe even worse than horoscopes. You could probably take the test a different day and get an entirely different result.
The only test that decides who you are is the test you take when you look at yourself in the mirror. If you see a phoenix, then be that phoenix.
All the love,
Sarah

Punk rock’s not dead.  In fact, punk rock is very much alive.  At the Roboto Punk Rock Flea Market on Saturday Sept. 24, a handful of local vendors and people looking to sell their vintage items gathered to promote themselves and the scene.
The Mr. Roboto Project, a music venue in Bloomfield, brought back the market after a year-long hiatus.  Before, the market was held every couple months, but it has recently resurfaced, featuring not only the best of the scene, but also small artistic highlights of Pittsburgh as well.
Local artist Carly Casey sold her unique woven dreamcatchers and banners to the Flea Market.  She also sold her prints and patches that blended right in to the underground, vintage vibe of the Mr. Roboto Project and the Punk Rock Flea Market.
People from all over Pittsburgh gathered to sell their things, including old clocks, classic cassettes, Green Day CDs, comics as recent as Ms. Marvel and as classic as Brian Michael Bendis’ run of Daredevil, and even a Nintendo Gamecube featuring Super Smash Bros. Melee, which was left on for visitors to play with and compete against each other.  
Punky Comics and Scumball Co. also featured their art at the Flea Market.  Punky Comics sells a variety of products featuring their original art, such as stickers and zines as well as originally curated cassettes and vinyl.  Their zines feature their original art highlighting the best and the weird of the alternative culture of Pittsburgh.  Scumball Co. also specializes in weird and cool designs, selling their own shirts and stickers.
To compliment the vintage vibe of the Flea Market, The Black Cat Market sold their original blend of coffee, Grounds and Hounds Coffee, and Three Rivers Tea Company Tea, along with their own mugs, sleeves, stickers, and buttons to promote the café’s opening this fall.  The Black Cat Market will be Pittsburgh’s first cat café, where they will serve coffee and bring cats for visitors to play with.  The Black Cat Market also sold their own vegan sugar cookies, a sampling of the treats the café will have to offer when it opens.
City Grows is an urban organic garden shop that featured their air plants, which are special kinds of plants that require extra care.  The shop strives to integrate helping the earth in every aspect of their business, often recycling items or repurposing them for future use.  Additionally, the shop only sells certified organic plants and products.
The Mr. Roboto Project also sold their own merchandise outside the market, and participated in the flea market by selling other bands' shirts, records, and spools of ribbon for $1 each.
At the Mr. Roboto Punk Rock Flea Market, the community truly came together to learn about and celebrate the scene.  The scene never dies; rather it evolves, and has brought along several different aspects of what makes Pittsburgh great.

"I'm sorry, sir. You can't come in here with that camera."
"I'm sorry? What?"
"I'm sorry. But the lens is too large" 
"Um, I'm sorry, but I'm supposed to be photographing this event. I'm a journalist," (with an unreasonable amount of authority on the words): "...with The Tartan."
"I'm sorry but you can't come in here. You're going to have to put that in your car" 
The voice of Lauren Mayberry, lead singer of CHVRCHES, rang over the the sounds of my protests to the gate guards. 
My camera and I began our 1.5 mile walk back to the car from whence we came. 
As I left, my three companions shuffled into the undulating crowd and I trudged back through the shallow waves of people stumbling down the gravel road making their way to the old Carrie Furnaces. The glowing rusted bastion of Pittsburgh industry glows now from the colored lights of the Thrival Music & Innovation Festival rather than the long-gone fires of the the Andrew Carnegie factory.  
The glow permeated the air on my walk back. Dejected, I resolved that I wasn't going to spend $60 to not hear anything. I tried my hardest to listen to the songs that were becoming increasingly distant. The pulsing basses and floaty vocals oozed through the rusted metal walls, through the humid air and gently stroked my cochlea. The sound is louder. Louder than it is. I'm walking away from the glow but the pulsing is now growing. It's now infused with the buzzes of the cicadas lurking in the empty green. Filled with the echos of the people in the distance. At the festival. In their cars. On the bridge. In their little postcard houses perched like parakeets chattering in response to the ruckus below. The footsteps. Mine. The passing bands of event-goers, passing ships. The beat set not by the musicians on stage but by us. Footsteps:
thudthudthud
thudthud
thud
thudthudthudthudthud
thud
thud 
thud
...
thudthudthud...
Lauren still sings but it's haunting now. Slightly out of tune from the reverberations. It seems as though it is coming from the trees, the ghosts lurking there. The apparition poses the bodies of those brightly dressed, flower-crowned humans and they sing too. All slightly in different tunings, ricocheting off of each other without meaning to. 
I reach the bridge finally. 
It's only a few more blocks to the car. 
I think. 
A car nearly hits me as I cross the first intersection on my way up the hill.
They yells something at me. 
I yell something back. 
And then walk a bit faster. 
Quite a bit. 
The next street seems right. 
It wasn't. 
Okay, so maybe the next one? 
Also no. 
I am back again on the original street. 
I think. 
Probably. 
That church looks familiar. 
All the churches look familiar. 
I start to hear the sound of upbeat jazz. It's coming from somewhere to my left. No, behind me. No, in front. It's definitely up the hill in front of me. 
It's now part of the Campbell's Old Fashioned Vegetable Soup of sounds that are swarming through my head. 
An exceptionally happenin' Baptist church appears on the crest of the hill. 
I recognize it's green and yellow stained glass windows with dark shadows from the people dancing within. We passed this on our way from the car the first time. 
It's now filled with a new kind of energy. It's different from that of the music festival below, but somehow the same. I stop here for a bit, listening to the bouncing guitar jumping over the drumbeats and slightly mistuned piano. The vocalist has a specific kind of confidence in her voice. A kind of sound that is assured by the intimacy of the room. The feeling that everyone in there must already know each other. She is singing for friends and wants to tell them a story. I try to hear the story too, but it's much harder on the outside. Everyone in there already knows the story. But they want to hear it again anyways. They want her to tell it to them. I know it well. Singing the self-made Karaoke of friends dancing around the living room and squawking on makeshift instruments. I can't hear hear their song, and they can't hear mine, we all have our own stories we sing and our own joyous crowds that dance as silhouettes on the walls and through the windows. 
A tinted-window black BMW slowly inches up to me and I walk in the opposite direction as hurriedly and nonchalantly as I possibly can. The car waits there for a bit. I keep going away. Back down the hill. Away from my car. They slowly inch down the street, stop at the poignantly glowing red light, and then ooze around the corner. I hold for a minute. And then I walk back the way I had just left, up past the church again, and then down to the car. My finger slips and I hit the alarm key. I fumble to shut it off. It dies off after a couple more protests. Reaching into the dark cavern of the hatchback trunk, I set down my trusty companion for this little trek. The horn beeps as the car assures me that it's locked. I begin the walk back down to Thrival. 30 minutes later and without a camera this time. I cycle back through the sounds and scenes as I did on my way out. Everything still rings but is a little more distant from me this time around. 
Knowing I will be just in time to witness Lauren's "Thank you for being amazing fans" and "We've loved playing for you", I still trudged back down my familiar hill. A journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step.

The day-to-day activities of a typical Carnegie Mellon student involve interacting with many different people. This ranges from our classmates to our friends and professors. Also serving an integral part in the everyday lives of Carnegie Mellon students are the CulinArt employees who provide us with our food and beverages (coffee for many) to help us get through the day. The CulinArt employees play an important role in the inner workings and success of the Carnegie Mellon community, but how well have their paychecks reflected this?
Many of the CulinArt employees at Carnegie Mellon have engaged in a long and arduous struggle to acquire decent payment. Their fight to be heard finally came to fruition on Sept. 23 when, in a 44–3 decision, workers voted to enact a new contract that would gradually increase their wages to be over $16.75 during the next four years. $16.75 is a massive leap for Production 1 workers (those who provide us with our food), who now make up to only $13.35 an hour. Many workers make even less than this.
$13.35 is not nearly enough money for workers to make a decent living, especially with the responsibility of taking care of their families. Not only were workers desperate for change, but they were also fueled by the knowledge that they were being drastically underpaid when compared to Production 1 workers at the University of Pittsburgh (Sodexo) and Duquesne University (Parkhurst).
Compared to the $13.35 CulinArt workers currently make, Sodexo workers make up to $15.92 and Parkhurst workers make up to $15.65. This new contract will not just close the wage gap between CulinArt, Sodexo, and Parkhurst workers, but will also place CulinArt workers ahead of the other two.
The Tartan spoke with Takeisha Johnson and Ericka Coleman, two CulinArt employees, to get their perspectives on the challenges they face with being underpaid and how this new contract will positively impact their lives.
Coleman, who has been a CulinArt employee for two and a half years, can be seen at Rothberg’s Roasters II in Scott Hall. Every Sunday through Thursday, she wakes up at 5 a.m. to tend to her 13-year-old and 20-month-old daughters and 5-year-old son before she gets ready for her 11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. shift.
Johnson, who has been a CulinArt employee for eight years, can be seen at the Downtown Deli of the Cohon Center. She wakes up at 5:50 a.m. to help her 17-year-old daughter and 15-year-old son get ready for school before she arrives at 8:30 a.m. to start gathering the food for her 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. shift at the deli.
Coleman and Johnson love interacting with the Carnegie Mellon students that visit their dining areas, and love when students thank them and acknowledge their service. However, sometimes the struggle to acquire enough money to live a comfortable life can take its toll. “Everyday people ask me ‘Hi Ericka, how are you?’ and my response is I am overworked and underpaid,” Coleman said. She initially made $9.50 during her first three years as a CulinArt employee before receiving a gradual raise to $12.02, which she believes just wasn’t enough.
Service Employees International Union (SEIU) 32BJ represents the approximately 80 full time CulinArt workers. Ryan Terrill, SEIU’s Lead Representative, noted the wall of separation and inequality that can exist between CulinArt workers and much of the rest of the Carnegie Mellon community. “On a campus like this where there is so much wealth, for inequality to happen here is really shocking. I think people should be aware of it.” Terrell said. “The people that provide service here are not robots, they are people with families, children, and dreams.” He further states, “In the same way the students come here with hopes and aspirations, there is also the idea that the people working here also have hopes and aspirations.”
After Friday’s decision, Johnson expressed that she was excited that this wage increase will help her to support her family and will allow her to achieve the goals she has set for her children. She points out that she has a daughter who is currently a senior in high school and the extra money she will be acquiring will help her daughter make a successful transition to college. This additional money will also allow her to save enough money to pursue her own dreams.
Coleman and Johnson praise the professors at Carnegie Mellon who are always open to listening about their struggles and even take the time out to try and help. Gina Stanton, a Production 2 cook at Resnik, applauded the Carnegie Mellon students and professors who were an instrumental part in this new contract being negotiated. It was the collaboration of these individuals, the CulinArt workers, and the SEIU team that allowed the 80 full time CulinArt workers to receive this new contract, which will allow them to support their families, live more comfortable lives, and give back to the Pittsburgh community.
SEIU currently doesn’t represent the other approximately 40 part-time CulinArt workers, but is seeking to change this and bargain a contract that will support them as well.

Mortar Board’s Eta chapter at Carnegie Mellon University was presented the Golden Torch award at the National Mortar Board Conference in Indianapolis, Ind. over the past summer. The Golden Torch is awarded annually at the National Mortar Board Conference to the most outstanding chapters of Mortar Board across the nation.
Mortar Board is a senior honor society first founded in 1912 at The Ohio State University, Swarthmore College, and the University of Chicago. Carnegie Mellon’s Eta chapter was founded in 1923, at the then Carnegie Institute of Technology. A select few rising senior students among all disciplines are invited to join Mortar Board each year based on their leadership, academic excellence, and dedication to service. The Mortar Board plays an active role in both the Carnegie Mellon community as well as the Pittsburgh community through several annual events on campus, such as Staff Appreciation Day which is dedicated to recognize the staff members who are working behind the scenes at Carnegie Mellon. Through Mortar Board advisor Sharon Craver, who is also the principal of The Children’s School at Carnegie Mellon, Mortar Board scholars work closely with children and provide educational weekend events for students.
Joshua Zak ’17, a Science and Humanities Scholar studying chemistry, is currently serving as the president of Carnegie Mellon Mortar Board. Zak was invited to join the Carnegie Mellon Mortar Board last spring. In July, he represented the Carnegie Mellon chapter at the annual National Mortar Board Conference at Indianapolis, Ind. “The Mortar Board national conference in Indianapolis was an amazing experience,” said Zak. “In just a few short days, the national representatives and section leaders gave me all the information and resources I will need to lead a successful chapter.” He was selected as the student president of Mortar Board a few months before the conference. The experience at the conference had transformed his perspective on Mortar Board.
At the 2016 conference, 36 chapters out of all 231 chapters in the nation were presented the Golden Torch award for their exemplary performance in the past year. The most recent graduating alumni of the Carnegie Mellon Mortar Board have achieved excellence in their scholarship as well as their leadership in a variety of events. “[Last year’s Mortar Board members] were all extremely excited to hear that they had won a Golden Torch as it was one of the goals they strove for last year,” said Zak, “I hope we can repeat their successes.”
In the upcoming months, the Carnegie Mellon Mortar Board will kick off their annual fundraiser “Turkey for a Day.” This event happens around Thanksgiving to raise money for charities supported by different professors. During this event, students at the university can donate to vote for their choice of professor. The four professors who receive the most donations will dress up in turkey costumes for a day. In the past years, Carnegie Mellon Mortar Board has successfully raised over $1,000 in this one event, and has donated to different non-profit organizations.
Being a part of the organization brings not only exceptional opportunities to participate in service and volunteering activities within the Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh community, but also plenty of chances to network with accomplished alumni from across the nation. Every member selected is guaranteed a $500 scholarship from ReadAcad, a prestigious non-profit venture management program. In addition, the benefit of membership also contains opportunities to apply to prestigious scholarships such as the NIH-Oxford-Cambridge Scholars Program as well as the paid fellowship with City Hall Fellows.
Every spring, invitations will be sent to the top 30 percent of the junior class to encourage them to apply to be members of the Mortar Board. After reviewing the applications, Mortar Board invites the top 50 applicants to join the chapter.

Out of the millions of Uber customers out there, only two can say that they were the first riders in an Uber self-driving car, and it happened here in Pittsburgh.
On Sept. 14, Carnegie Mellon President Subra Suresh and Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto shared a ride in the first official self-driving Uber. They were picked up at City Hall with two Carnegie Mellon alumni, Uber test operations manager Peter Castelli (CIT, Mechanichal Engineering ‘03) and Uber vehicle operator David Power (CFA, Industrial Design ‘16), who made sure the ride went smoothly in the front seat. After driving around Oakland, Suresh and Peduto were dropped off at the University. This marks the company’s unveiling of this technology and their promotion of its accessibility to the public.
Not only is it significant for the University that President Suresh got to represent the school at this technological milestone, but Carnegie Mellon’s role in autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is also what makes this ride so important for the academic community.
“Universities like Carnegie Mellon have the power to change the world. This demonstration is a very good example of that,” Suresh said in a university press release. “This is why innovation is so closely connected to research universities. For several decades, Carnegie Mellon has pioneered the technology behind autonomous vehicles.”
According to the school’s College of Engineering website, for the past 30 years, Carnegie Mellon has been at the forefront of the AV field. In 1984, Carnegie Mellon made the first autonomous vehicle, the Terregator, that could only travel a couple centimeters per second. Since then, Carnegie Mellon has made 140 invention disclosures for AV technologies.
“The college has developed a tremendous body of work during the past 30 years in the area of self-driving technology, and we will continue our efforts in shaping the future of transportation,” dean of the College of Engineering James Garrett said in an interview for the Engineering magazine.
As this field advances, more updates will be added to auto production. For example, parking assistance and adaptive cruise control are now in commercial vehicles.
“Features of automated self-driving cars will appear incrementally and organically, with vehicles eventually driving themselves. This will make the cars affordable and encourage public adoption,” Professor Raj Rajkumar of electrical and computer engineering and the co-director of the GM Collaborative Research Lab at Carnegie Mellon said in an interview for the Engineering Magazine.
Right now, the people of Pittsburgh can experience this technology in a self-driving car through Uber’s pilot program. The ride-sharing company will be inviting its most loyal customers to have the option of being picked up by one of these cars. When requesting an Uber, the rider will get a self-driving Uber, if available, that has a safety driver to make sure the ride goes as planned.
In a press release from Uber about self-driving cars being available in Pittsburgh, the company said that “self-driving Ubers have enormous potential to further [their] mission and improve society: reducing the number of traffic accidents, which today kill 1.3 million people a year; freeing up the 20 percent of space in cities currently used to park the world’s billion plus cars; and cutting congestion, which wastes trillions of hours every year.”
Carnegie Mellon’s College of Engineering website says that predicted that the rise of AV technology will change the world of transportation in the next ten years. Also, it’s expected that during the years 2020-2030, cars will contain a virtual valet that will park cars by using a phone app and traffic jam assistance.
“In the not-so-distant future self-driving cars will provide society with many benefits pertaining to safety and quality of life,” said Rajkumar in an interview for the Engineering Magazine.

This Thursday, on Sept. 22, Jonathan Rosenbaum, a freelance film critic, gave a lecture in Porter Hall 100 about how the advent of the internet and modern technology has affected film criticism. Rosenbaum, who was the head film critic for the Chicago Reader for twenty years, continues to write film criticisms on his website.
After taking the stage, Rosenbaum immediately made it clear that “rather than planned-out lectures, [he] much prefers dialogues to monologues,” thus opening himself up for questions and commentary. This was analogous to his general attitude toward film criticism. He enjoys having an online presence, as he feels like he has “more of a community profile on [his] website than [he] did when [he] was writing for the Chicago Reader.” Now that he can write for a more film-centric niche market rather than for a general audience, he is able to open up a dialogue with his readers about topics he and his readers are both passionate about. He mentioned a few instances where his readers would write to him soon after he made a blog post, pointing out his typos and questioning his ideas.
In addition, with a website, Rosenbaum is able to reach a wider, more diverse audience. According to him, “at least half — sometimes more than half — of the people who come to the site are not even from the United States, but from various parts all over the world.” Even though Rosenbaum was given unusual freedoms, such as no limit on length, at the Chicago Reader, he still had some limits put on him by his editors, and now without these restrictions he is able to reflect on the differences between both experiences.
His experience of being politically censored by his editors illustrated those limits. In one of his articles, he mentioned his trip to Tehran, saying that “walking down the street, [he] could see it was as multicultural as the United States,” and his editor would not allow him to write that unless he could prove it. Rosenbaum states that his editor was often selective, in a biased way, about what he needed hard evidence for and what he didn’t.
Throughout the lecture, Rosenbaum brought up the viewpoints of the opposing side, the side that sees modern technology as the slow destruction of film criticism. Some of his colleagues, in fact, “feel that there was a ‘golden age of film criticism’ back in the ‘60s and ‘70s. That’s all over now. They basically see [the internet] in completely dystopian, negative terms,” Rosenbaum said. He also spoke about the issue of oversimplification, calling the problem “a conflict between market and scholarship.” The simpler an article, the wider an audience it will reach, and this kind of simplification leads to a certain amount of dishonesty, because reality is not always simple. 
In relation to this idea, Rosenbaum stated multiple times that we should not divide the world into black and white, right and wrong. To do so would be to overgeneralize.
The latter part of the lecture focused on discussion. Multiple people in the audience asked questions which led to discussions about film quality and the criteria for quality. Rosenbaum drew a distinction between “review” and “criticism,” saying that reviews had some impact on the market, while criticism did not have a consumerist side to it. He also questioned if, with regard to art and culture, we have lowered our canon, or if we have simply changed the standards for something to be included in our canon.
The lecture was informative and, parallel to Rosenbaum’s vision, felt more like a dialogue than a monologue. It reflected the different facets of film criticism — its so-called “golden age,” and how it has changed in the face of modern technology; yet it also went beyond film and media. The talk touched on ideas like how the internet affects our perception of divisive issues, the importance of being honest about complexity and reality in writing, and the value of a diverse readership. Though Rosenbaum now writes for a smaller audience, they are more engaged and ready to comment on his work. According to him, and echoed by his readers, “the quality of the audience is much more important than the quantity.”

Braddock Mayor John Fetterman held a reception on Sept. 19 at his home to raise funds for the Democratic candidate for Pennsylvania Attorney General, Josh Shapiro. If appointed as Attorney General, Shapiro will represent the state in legal proceedings and will act as an advocate for the public, according to the National Association of Attorney Generals.
Shapiro spoke to approximately 50 adults, outlining his plans for promoting minority rights and reducing incarceration. Regarding policies relevant to college students, he said, “I am going to be doing everything I can to help students in dealing with campus sexual assault, which is a huge problem on campuses, and [will help] students deal with fraud against them by student loan companies.”
Shapiro said he will ensure that when someone makes a report to an official, such as a Resident Assistant or an administrator, the official knows who this information needs to be reported to, thus creating a reporting chain. He plans to do this by requiring all such leaders to sign an agreement confirming that they “understand what their responsibilities are.” Shapiro has also promised to eliminate the backlog of over 1,800 evidence kits in Pennsylvania by processing the evidence in sexual assault cases.
In addition, Shapiro mentioned the illicit collection of student debt as a problem since many debt collection agencies deceive students so that they pay more than they actually owe on their student loans. On his campaign website, he vows to “protect Pennsylvanians with student loan debt by cracking down on the predatory lenders and collection agencies that try to take advantage of them.”
Shapiro also urged students to communicate with political leaders like him, whether it be through email, Snapchat, or Facebook. “I do things that are helpful to students when I hear from them. But they have to be engaged in the process, certainly in the political process, and ultimately in the governing process as well,” he said.
While many students are disappointed with how politicians often fail to govern effectively, Shapiro encouraged them to nevertheless advocate for their preferred candidate. “I think getting frustrated and not voting doesn’t accomplish anything since you don’t get the government that you want,” he said.
There is a large controversy surrounding the position of P.A. Attorney General since Kathleen Kane, the previous Attorney General, was forced to resign in Aug. after being convicted of nine criminal charges including conspiracy, perjury, and obstruction of justice, according to The New York Times. That’s why Shapiro said his first priority is to restore integrity to the office. Shapiro believes that if he can hire people with integrity and establish a culture of honesty, he will “give the outside world the confidence in what we are doing, and we will be able to tackle these challenges.”
Shapiro emphasized his integrity, contrasting it with Kane’s corruption by saying, “What you are hearing from me is what I say in every community across Pennsylvania. Someone said to me, ‘Oh my God, you are going to talk about LGBT rights in Western Pennsylvania?’ Yeah, not only am I going to talk about it, I am going to put an ad on TV about it.” Shapiro said this in the same spot where a same-sex couple had previously gotten married.
Shapiro also promised to protect the right to safe drinking water for all Pennsylvanians. “That’s not just because I care about the environment or that I’m endorsed by the Environmental Group. It’s because your state constitution says you have a right to clean air and water,” he said.
Furthermore, Shapiro believes that the Pennsylvania education system is not thorough and efficient, a violation of the state constitution. There is currently a case before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania contesting whether the state has been providing a quality education to all students. Even though he is seeking to be Pennsylvania’s legal representative, Shapiro has announced that he will not support the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. “I will join with the plaintiffs and I will fight to make sure we get a thorough and efficient education system,” he said.
Voters, including many Carnegie Mellon students, will have the opportunity to decide who will become Attorney General for the next four years. Shapiro, for his part, believes he can use this position to advance the public good, describing how he hopes to run the Office of Attorney General by saying, “I want to create the largest public-interest law firm in the entire country.”

Carnegie Mellon students connect sports to statistics with the Pittsburgh Pirates
Carnegie Mellon’s statistics students had the unique opportunity to explore the connections between sports and statistics earlier this month with a little help from the Pittsburgh Pirates. Recently, professional teams have become more interested in collecting data about players’ strengths and weaknesses to identify a possible edge. This is where statistics comes into play.
Undergraduate statistics majors from the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences alongside members of the Tartan Sports Analytics Club (TSAC) were able to meet with the Pirates’ analytics team before the game. Students got to ask a variety of questions to the team’s data architect, Josh Smith, quantitative analyst, Mike Fitzgerald, and director of baseball informatics, Dan Fox.
Many TSAC members have had the chance to intern or work for professional sports teams including the Pirates and teams in the NFL and NBA. Faculty advisor of TSAC and visiting assistant professor in the statistics department, Sam Ventura, works as an analytics consultants for the Pittsburgh Penguins.
BrainHub to hold its first Neurons to Neighborhoods event on Friday Sept. 30
This Friday, some of the leading experts in early childhood development will meet with local policymakers for the first Neurons to Neighborhoods community outreach event, all thanks to Carnegie Mellon University’s BrainHub. Sponsored by The Heinz Endowments, the event hopes to educate government officials and early caregivers on the latest research in early brain development.
The goal of BrainHub is two-fold: to conduct groundbreaking brain research and to share their findings with government officials and health care service providers to help them modify their policies and everyday practices.
President of the Heinz Endowments, Grant Oliphant, will give a welcome address. Dean of the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, Richard Scheines, Interim Director of BrainHub and professor of biological sciences, Alison Barth, Director of the Children’s School, Sharon Carver, the Cowan University professor of cognitive neuroscience, Marlene Behrmann, and associate professor of psychology, David Rakison, will be speaking at the event. Additional talks will be given by other early development experts from Harvard University, University of Maryland, Columbia University, and the Bezos Family Foundation.
Neurons to Neighborhoods will be held from 8:30 a.m.-3:30 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 30 in Hamburg Hall.

Editor’s Note: Dominique Escandon is the Cabinet Writer of The Student Government.
Dressed in our very best outfits for exploring and talking about our feelings, be that overalls (Srishti Jain, Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence Prevention Advocate) or an explorer hat-and-vest combo (Aaron Gutierrez, Student Body Vice President), eleven members of the President’s Cabinet made the winding trek to North Park for a Cabinet retreat. The mood shifted to reflective when Vaasavi Unnava, Student Body President, asked us to take a few minutes to write a response to the question, “What do you want CMU to be like?”
That’s a tough one. It was, of course, my active choice to enroll in Carnegie Mellon almost a year and a half ago, but every day since then my understanding of what it means to be a student here has been challenged and changed, not into something permanently ugly, but definitely something complicated.
The sentiment was shared. Frustrations toward a lack of inter-grade interactions or communal spaces to just relax or share conversation are routed in the belief that every student here is interesting and worth getting to know. A desire for more female professors — voiced by Olivia Roy, our chief of staff and a senior majoring in mechanical engineering, who has never been taught engineering by a woman —- stems from the knowledge that Carnegie Mellon attracts incredible talent and our faculty has a significant impact on our lives. The fact that many students view their Carnegie Mellon University experience as transaction-based, putting up what they need for an expected professional gain, means that we trust that this institution facilitates success based on effort.
But what about imposter syndrome, the belief that everyone around you is a genius and you are the only one who is struggling, which runs rampant through our individually-able and always-imperfect student body? The name of Carnegie Mellon, the motto of putting your all in the work (with work placed under a strict definition of academics), means you have something to prove, but it’s driving us past our limits. How can we make students more comfortable speaking about how they are doing without fear of being exposed as a “fraud”? Do students believe that they will be listened to? Are there ways to increase the potential of new positive interactions with peers for reasons other than academia, to give us a chance to breathe and explore?
Most of us choose every year to commit once again to Carnegie Mellon, but no one denies that there is much to be done to make all of Carnegie Mellon University’s promises and holistic potential a reality. The magic of student government is in their attempt to 1) understand the issues our students are facing and their causes and 2) expedite the process of creating a better university for the community it is serving. The final question we were asked to answer was, imagining that we could accomplish everything we wanted in our time on President’s Cabinet, what would those things be? Answers varied from scholarships to improved interfaces to student summits around a cause, but every single one was ambitious and inspiring (all our active projects will soon be posted online!), and we are all so hopeful for the success of this school year.

Football games are an unlikely battleground for racial debate. However, when Colin Kaepernick, a San Francisco 49ers quarterback, refused to stand for the national anthem before a game to protest police violence in America, it ignited fresh controversy to the already nationwide dispute.
The simple act of kneeling or sitting while teammates and audience members pledged themselves to their country was intended, according to Kaepernick, to bring attention to race issues in the U.S. 
However, it has inspired sharply contrasting perspectives of the true weight and meaning of the action. One is that of a selfish, pampered professional athlete pushing a personal agenda at the expense of his spectators. 
There were likely many veterans and government employees in the audience who would have been insulted by this apparent rejection of their service and sacrifice, in addition to any ordinary, patriotic American fans.
Yet there is another, more nuanced, perception — that of an American exemplifying the very ideals that the national anthem is supposed to represent. Colin Kaepernick’s decision to protest doesn’t mean that he rejects American values, but rather that he believes these values to have been abused by this nation. It is an attempt to remind his audience — which has now grown from a stadium to the entire nation — of the meaning of the song they are singing. Not only freedom of expression, but of equality, specifically racial equality. 
In an interview after one of the games, Kaepernick told NFL Media, “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”
Last week, three Miami Dolphin players replicated his actions, kneeling together during the Star-Spangled Banner before a game. In response, a police union for Broward County sheriff’s office wanted to stop their protection of Dolphins players, challenging their constitutional rights as NFL players. 
“I respect their right to have freedom of speech,” Jeff Bell, president of the union, told the Miami Herald. “However, in certain organizations and certain jobs you give up that right of your freedom of speech [temporarily] while you serve that job or while you play in an NFL game.”
Ironically, he’s completely correct, but not with regard to football players — it applies, rather, to himself. The NFL is not a government organization, so their employees are not considered servants of the people, and thus may retain their constitutional rights, such as freedom of speech. 
Police officers, however, do lose a certain degree of liberty when they put on their uniform. As law enforcement, they represent the authority of the government, and therefore must sacrifice personal opinions in favor of their duty.
These few police union members, as well as any other critics who may challenge these players’ rights to protest in this manner, seem to be laboring under the delusion that the Star-Spangled Banner represents only a flawless nation of unquestioning loyalty and superficially eloquent professions of freedom. 
It does not. The anthem represents a diverse and imperfect nation, full of division and controversy, because the only way to avoid conflict in such a diverse nation is to force silence. 
These constitutional rights were created explicitly to protect us from any such compulsion. Kaepernick decided to break the forced silence that he believed to surround this controversy of police violence, and so he kneeled, protected by the very music echoing around him.

Imagine you’re at work. There has been buzz surrounding a new employee, and your coworker won’t stop pestering you on your opinion of the new employee. Wanting to stay out of the office politics, but also wanting to be left alone, you answer a simple, “As of now, I don’t like him, but we’ve only had one conversation.” Satisfied, your coworker returns to her work, and never brings up this new employee again.
But the next morning, on the front page of the office newsletter is an article about how much you hate the new employee and are hoping he is fired as soon as possible. In the article, there is no reference to the actual words you said, but simply an analysis of what you said, taken completely out of context. It sounds completely unrealistic, but it’s not. This is something the American media has done far too often this election cycle and, in turn, they have harmed the American political process.
With an outspoken candidate like Donald Trump, the media has taken it into their own hands to interpret what Trump said without providing what he actually said. The New York Times recently published an article claiming that Trump said he believes that Barack Obama was born in the United States, and any claim otherwise was simply Hillary Clinton’s latest attempt to prove him distrustful. But, interestingly enough, the author Michael Barbaro never directly quoted the entirety of what Trump said, and only offered his own analysis.
The New York Times’ goal is clear: to continue to paint distrust in Donald Trump and show how he is inept to be President of the United States. Trump has been notorious this election for his fear mongering tactics, and Barbaro’s article (and many others like it) are the media’s way of employing their own fear mongering tactics. Fearful that America may elect Trump, they too play into the game, and only offer their fear ridden analysis.
But Americans aren’t as uneducated as the mass media would like to believe. Instead, these fear mongering tactics have become noticeable, and the public’s trust in the media is falling. Gallup recently conducted a 
poll on the public’s perception of the media, and found that only 32 percent have some trust in the media. This number has been decreasing steadily, especially among Americans aged 18-49, a measly 26 percent of whom find the media trustful.
The lack of trust in the media harms the American political process. With the media also 
labeling politicians as “stupid,” it contributes to the increasing polarization in America. Instead of allowing the public to form their own opinions on what was said or happened, the media presents a two-sided issue and defends one side. But political issues are never as black and white as they seem, and the current media presentation of issues does not allow for a gray area.
While many Americans may be distrustful of the media, it is the place they go to when they want to keep up to date with current events. So while the general public may be distrustful of what is said, at the end of the day they do see issues as two-sided. While Clinton supporters may have enjoyed The New York Times article, it only continued to place distrust in the media among Trump supporters and created further tension between the two.
This tension further harms the American political process as it decreases compromise among Democrats and Republicans. Democrats see Fox News as destructive and Republicans see CNN as spreading misinformation, and the 
increasing bias present in both continues the polarization of America.
If the media instead focused on reporting the facts — what was said and what happened — in a factual manner, Americans would be more willing to compromise. They would not be offered an analysis of what is said, but simply freedom to come to their own conclusions. And if Trump is as terrible as many media outlets believe, most Americans will come to the same conclusion, anyways.
This isn’t to say that the media shouldn’t provide any analysis. With less than half the American population aged 25 and older possessing at least an associate’s degree, most Americans don’t have the education level to understand or the time to research how current events affect our domestic and foreign affairs. But the media should first present current events in a factual manner, and then allow for analysis without the name calling.
The Founding Fathers included “freedom of speech, or the press” to allow Americans to be free to express their political opinions, and to have access to information without government interference. The press is meant to belong to the people and it’s time we are provided with the truth, not simply an analysis of it.

Editor’s note: this is part three  of The Pragmatist’s Manifesto. This weekly column encourages civil discussion about politics in the U.S. Find previous installments @ thetartan.org. 
Up to this point in my four-part defense of the two-party system, we have covered our modern media divide and a large piece of early American history. For those of you just tuning in, I will sum it up. Even though the Founding Fathers may have preferred to not have partisan divisions, the system they built in the Constitution lent itself to functioning best with two parties. Fast forward to the present day, and our access to a broad spectrum of media has entrenched people in their beliefs. This has hampered our society’s ability to compromise, a critical component of American governance in a two-party system.
For our entire lives, fellow students, we have only known one kind of politics: that of zero-sum. It is win or lose. Today, we are going to analyze how we have reached this unsustainable point in our political culture by looking back at the last 50 years of history and the factors that brought us to this election. This will include an exploration of a key principle for this argument: the Median Voter Theorem.
In the early part of the 20th century, it was the Republicans who had the support of black voters (you know, because of the whole ending slavery thing). Democrats kept those southern voters who helped elect Woodrow Wilson in 1912. After the Great Depression and WWII, however, the fight for civil rights came to the forefront with the election of 1948 and the emergence of the States’ Rights Democratic Party.
The 1948 Democratic convention saw northern Democrats fight to adopt a plank that endorsed Democratic President Truman’s pro-civil rights agenda. Several southern states’ delegations walked out of the convention to form their own third party (around this single issue), and ran Strom Thurmond for President. These Southern Democrats became known as the States’ Rights Democratic Party, or the “Dixiecrats.”
In the end, Truman won in a stunning upset over Republican Thomas Dewey. He did this even with Thurmond winning four southern states. But the Dixiecrats weren’t finished.
Through two Dwight Eisenhower routs of Democrat Adlai Stevenson and eight years of his Republican administration, the civil rights movement gained steam, especially with the Brown v. Board of Education ruling in 1954. Then came one of the most tense elections in our history: 1960.
Democrat John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Republican Richard Nixon while holding off another anti-civil rights insurrection from the Dixiecrats. Harry Byrd, a segregationist Democrat, received several electoral votes despite not actually running for President.
After Kennedy’s assassination and Democratic President Lyndon Johnson’s signing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Dixiecrats began to defect from the party. This is the beginning of the current divisions we know today. In the 1964 election, Johnson completely routed the GOP nominee, Barry Goldwater, who won only six states, five of which were in the deep south, traditionally Democratic states. Then the 1965 Voting Rights Act dismantled the Jim Crow laws of the south, causing even more Dixiecrats to defect to the Republican banner.
The 1968 election has incredible parallels to our current dilemma, which will be discussed at length next week. Nixon took up the cause of “Law and Order” (sound familiar?). Thus was born the “Southern Strategy” to attract southern whites to the GOP, and we have seen how this is a core platform of the Republican Party today.
Nixon also criticized the Johnson administration’s handling of the Vietnam War. It was the war that led Johnson to decide not to run for re-election. Nixon beat Hubert Humphrey, who had been nominated after not running in the primaries. One can imagine why many on the left were not excited about Humphrey, who was associated with Johnson’s unpopular war. This election cycle saw the Dixiecrats rebel once again in the form of Mr. Segregation, George Wallace, and the “American Independent Party.”
Wallace used a law and order narrative similar to Nixon’s, except he did not expect to win the election. He used his third party to attempt to prevent either party from achieving a majority in the Electoral College, making him the kingmaker when the House of Representatives would vote for President. This strategy failed however, and Nixon won. Wallace’s voters would flock to Nixon for his landslide reelection in 1972. Those segregationists, some of whom are still alive, found their home in the Republican Party for good.
After the Watergate scandal and Republican President Gerald Ford’s pardon of Nixon, Democrat Jimmy Carter won the election in 1976. Republican Ronald Reagan ascended to the White House by winning the 1980 election. Reagan incorporated religious conservatives into his coalition. These religious conservatives still form a block of the current GOP. It should be noted that Reagan managed to make compromises with the minority Democrats to pass laws on immigration and gun reform. We will return to how this sense of pragmatism disappeared.
The next three elections saw Republican landslides. This can be attributed to not only poor campaigns from the Democrats who ran against Reagan and Bush, but also from the general shift of ideology of the American electorate. The 1960’s and 70’s saw a shift to the left in Johnson’s Great Society programs, but the counter-movement to this was a shift to conservatism in the 1980’s. This is all extremely simplified, but can be illustrated using the Median Voter Theorem.
For the record, I am not a math major; in this portion of defending the two-party system, I have tapped the wisdom of Carnegie Mellon Math professor Mary Radcliffe for an explanation. The Median Voter Theorem follows the logic that two main parties in a country will want to appease the most number of voters by appealing to a median voter. They don’t need to hit the precise middle of the political spectrum, but a point that covers a majority of the electorate.
The basic model of the theorem puts all voters only on one dimension; for all intents and purposes, we will imagine it in two. If you are given an xy axis, and set one axis as a personal freedom preference, and one as an economic freedom preference, you can put Liberal, Statist, Conservative, and Libertarian in four quadrants with a centrist section in the middle. By using data guaging opinions from major voter blocks, we can plot points of the preferences of large numbers of American voters. The Pew Research Survey, that analyzes where you stand on the political spectrum, breaks the population down into seven major groups: Steadfast Conservatives, Business Conservatives, Young Outsiders, Hard-Pressed Skeptics, Next Generation Left, Faith and Family Left, and Solid Liberals.
Putting these voting groups’ preferences on a graph shows where candidates should stand on certain issues to have the support of the broadest coalition. Multiple parties would put smaller voter blocks in constant conflict as these narrower minded parties would have trouble forming effective coalitions. If a candidate in a two-party system can achieve a majority coalition, it ideally ensures that the party that wins the election represents the majority of the people. One can also plot candidates individually and find from where they form their coalitions and how far they are from the ideal position on the spectrum.
The preferences of major blocks can also change over periods of time, causing shifts in the entire electorate. Moving back toward our historical discussion, we can imagine that the median voter shifted from the left to the right from the 1960’s to the 80’s, causing the GOP to more easily garner a large coalition. In response, the Democrats rebranded many of their ideals toward the center, culminating in the election of the center-left Bill Clinton in 1992. The electorate had shifted back to the left.
Skipping forward, the election of 2000 may have been one of the most disruptive elections of our history. Another third party, led by Ralph Nader, disrupted the two-party balance and threw the election toward Republican George W. Bush, who won the Electoral College vote but not the popular vote after a month-long legal dispute about a Florida recount in the Supreme Court. Despite the shift to the left, we now had a Republican president.
Having reached the Bush era, we have now passed the point discussed last week when media sources started to arise that were further apart ideologically than ever before. Our politics started to enter an era of intense partisanship; compromise fell to the wayside in favor of obstructionism. This only intensified with the election of Democrat Barack Obama in 2008.
As we discussed in the beginning of this article, the current GOP coalition includes voters that supported segregation just a few decades prior. From their perspective, the election of the first black man signified that they had lost a long battle. Now I am not insinuating that the GOP is mainly made up of these voters, but sometimes they become the loudest voices in the room defining the image of a party. The GOP took up obstructionism with the sworn promise to make Obama a one-term president. It helped create the least productive Congresses ever, and by far. These policies of hindrance that both parties have taken part in rather than active governance have greatly intensified the partisan divide.
We are now at a breaking point. The Constitution designed by the founders favors two major parties; the government cannot adequately function if rivals don’t make compromises. Broad coalitions that appeal to the most voters can achieve progress, albeit at a measured pace. Our two-party system is the most effective way to continue that pace, yet it is faltering under the weight of obstructionism. In such a large country as ours, anything too extreme on either side may be harmful to our republic.

It’s no secret that Zika is a growing concern in the U.S. With the number of cases rising, fast and accurate testing is a necessity. However, many Americans are being caught off guard by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) prolonging the testing process and leaving many potential cases undiagnosed. In July, the CDC released a flowchart that broke down who should be tested into three main groups: pregnant women who have traveled outside of the country, people that have shown symptoms, and sexual partners of people that have shown symptoms. These strict guidelines shut out groups like women who have traveled recently and plan to become pregnant. Guidelines for men are even stricter, with testing opportunities fewer and further between. Anger with the CDC has mounted as people go undiagnosed, but the source of the problem seems to lie elsewhere. As usual, it can be traced back to the gridlock in Congress.
The first case of Zika was reported in the U.S. on January 15, 2016 when a baby was born in Hawaii to a mother that had previously lived in Brazil. Then came the four cases in Miami, the first time Zika had been locally transmitted in the continental U.S. The CDC began to advise against traveling to known Zika areas and America listened to its advice. But for those that chose to travel to events such as the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, they were not able to find solace in the CDC’s testing policies. All the CDC could do was warn against travel and encourage long sleeves in places like Florida.
In August, the CDC spent $2.5 million on lab equipment to increase their capacity to test for Zika, a small price in comparison to the $1.9 billion that President Obama asked for in February to fight the expansion of the disease. Despite this influx of new equipment, the CDC still remained strict in its guidelines of who could be tested. Those at the bottom of the chain waiting for tests, however, still felt neglected. 
While the restrictions are in place to prevent an overload of testing, their exclusivity makes doctors hesitant to diagnose Zika for fear of not being able to give their patient a definitive answer or proper treatment for weeks. This could lead to someone with Zika being misdiagnosed. It also makes health insurers reluctant to fund the testing unless the doctor has told them that the patient appears ill or pregnant.
There are two main reasons that the CDC seems to have set these guidelines about testing. The first is the complicated history Zika funding has with Congress. Senate Democrats blocked the initial attempt to pass a $1.1 billion Zika bill. While there seems to be no reason to block a bill dedicated to funding the fight against Zika, there were some hidden clauses snuck in by Republicans. Included in the bill were restricted access to contraceptives and weaker environmental restrictions on pesticides. These provisions tried to ride the coattails of a bill that seemed sure to make it all the way to the oval office. 
The failure of a new $1.1 billion dollar bill with revisions last week has divided the Senate even further with Democrats blaming Republicans of trying to sneak funding away from other sectors of the governments and Republicans calling Democrats out for a lack of bipartisanship. Meanwhile the CDC, which was supposed to get $394 million of funding from this bill, has made it known that they will run out of money at the end of this month.
The second factor impacting the access to Zika testing is the number of tests being ordered. At the beginning of September, roughly 600 people were tested for Zika with several others unable to get access to the tests. Due to a lack of funding, however, CDC hasn’t been able to expand the amount of tests they can run which has led to these stricter guidelines. Much of the anger seems to be focused on the CDC, but it has made it known that they were going broke for a while. It isn’t the one that decides how much of the budget pie it gets, Congress is, but with tensions running high it seems like the most immediate reaction is to shoot the messenger.
Testing for Zika isn’t exactly a black and white process either. There are certain tests that have only been approved by the FDA in emergency cases. One of these emergency tests is Trioplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). It detects the RNA of Zika virus. Regular rRT-PCR are permitted for use on people with and without symptoms of Zika. Results for this test are obtained through blood and urine samples. Serologic Zika tests look for antibodies that develop in the first week of illness and are specifically for those that actually have the Zika virus. These tests can take time to show results and sometimes require an additional follow-up.
The amount of time needed for testing puts a serious bind on newly pregnant women who have recently traveled that would consider abortion. With the most cases happening in Florida, it isn’t really convenient that their abortion laws are more on the strict side. The law allows abortions during the first two trimesters, after that it is only permissible if “necessary to save life or preserve health of mother." This gives women roughly 28 weeks after conceiving to make a decision and with tests taking several weeks due to how many are being ordered, it doesn’t leave much time to make that decision.
The CDC has also not given couples who have traveled but would like to conceive many options either. If you or your partner has traveled to a Zika country, their suggestion is to wait eight weeks before trying to become pregnant. Their guidelines don’t mention trying to get tested at all. The only instance where they suggest talking to a healthcare provider is if either you or your partner lives in a Zika area. Even then it doesn’t outright say get tested and talking to a doctor could just lead to a more prolonged diagnosis in this case.
In addition to the rules being cloudy for whom to prioritize with women, it’s even harder to understand the advice of the CDC for men. While the disease can be spread through the semen of an infected man for six months, there is currently not a way to test semen for Zika. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends six months of protected sex for men who have been exposed to Zika, not testing.
The CDC is facing pressure from all ends of the spectrum from Congress all the way down to citizens that fear for their health. The limited access to testing has made it difficult not only for women who want to get pregnant, but for men who would like to know if they risk the possibility of spreading Zika to their partners. It seems that stricter guidelines are the only way the CDC can cover their monetary deficit, even if it means leaving several others undiagnosed. Congress must close the funding gap, or people will continue to fall through the cracks. The CDC’s hands are tied, so citizens need to put pressure on the source of the problem and make Congress appropriate the funds the CDC needs to function and protect Americans.

Donald Trump has degraded a lot of people on his climb to the nomination, but his ignorance and prejudice isn’t what this article is about. It’s about the ignorance and prejudice of the people trying to stop him.
Throughout most of history, people have used humor to combat those in political power, and the political cartoonists of today have been keeping that noble tradition alive, with Trump supplying plenty of ammunition. Most of these comics are brilliant, but there are quite a few bad apples mixed in that make my laughter go sour. Somehow, in their rush to highlight the way Trump stigmatizes and demonizes whole groups of people they’ve decided it’s okay to demonize the mentally ill.
The comic that illustrates this point most eloquently ran on politicalcartoons.com last month, and depicts Trump sitting in a padded cell, bound in a straight jacket and shouting phrases like, “Ban Muslims!” and “Build a wall!.” 
While Trump’s characterization of all Muslims as terrorists and all Mexican immigrants as criminals that need to be kept out of the United States is deplorable, implying that these are the kinds of things people in mental hospitals say is also damaging. It depicts the mentally ill as hateful and down right dangerous, which, firstly, is far from the truth and, secondly, plays into and reinforces stereotypes of mental illness that need to be torn down. 
The comic also uses the straight jacket and padded cell to undercut what Trump is saying and imply that no one should take him seriously since they are just the ramblings of a crazy person. Again, this reinforces damaging ideas about the mentally ill. Mentally ill people deserve to be listened to, and implying otherwise fortifies an existing culture that often leaves them excluded, taken advantage of, or ignored.
This trend in political cartoons in not just a fringe phenomenon. The Chattanooga Times Free Press Editorial Cartoonist Clay Bennett, who, according to the Times Free Press website, has “won almost every honor his profession has to offer” including a Pulitzer Prize, has published several of these offensive cartoons. One I found particularly striking,published last week in the Times Free Press, depicts two prescription bottles, one for Clinton and one for Trump. Clinton’s bottle bears the label “Antibiotics” while Trump’s says “Antipsychotics,” the implication being that Clinton’s physical health troubles are better than Trump’s tendency to act erratically and do stupid things. 
However, the comic also says that people shouldn’t vote for someone who takes antipsychotics. It simultaneously supports the destruction of barriers to the presidency by endorsing Clinton, the first female nominee for a major political party, and builds barriers for anyone who takes medicine for a mental illness. In addition, it automatically attaches a negative connotation to antipsychotics and the people who take them, even though antipsychotics treat a whole range of disorders, many of which have absolutely no effect on other people and just make it harder for the afflicted person to function, and none of which automatically make someone bigoted, hateful, or dangerous.
Subtle putdowns and insults toward the mentally ill have not been restricted to political cartoons and newsprint. They jump off the page every time someone says Trump is insane, or should be locked in a mental hospital. Think about how often you’ve heard someone say that. Now think about what it’s like to hear that when you’ve been in a mental hospital.
As a woman who struggles with mental illness, I’ve been getting mixed messages from this election. I’ve watched Clinton shatter a glass ceiling that existed for every generation of women before me, but I’ve also heard again and again that people like me, the mentally ill, cannot be trusted in politics, should be ignored, and are automatically dangerous.
I honestly love seeing political cartoonists taking up the pen against Trump. I firmly believe that humor is one of the best weapons we have, particularly against those in power. But in our fight against the powerful we need to be careful not to victimize people who are already victims.
