Last Friday and Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon men’s and women’s track and field teams competed at the Washington and Lee Carnival in Lexington, Va. The Tartans posted impressive results, with many top-10 finishes.
For the women, sophomore Ivanna Moses led the charge, placing second in the triple jump with a distance of 10.87 meters. Moses also earned a fourth-place finish in the long jump, with a distance of 5.20 meters. First-year Carissa Iannone finished sixth in the javelin, throwing 28.26 meters. Junior Morgan Faer also contributed to the team’s success, with a personal record of 39.22 meters in the hammer throw, which put her in seventh.
On the track, junior Courtney Baker placed third in the 1500-meter run, finishing in 4:48.78, closely followed by teammate junior Laura McKee, who finished in 4:55.49. In the 5000-meter run, the Tartans also fared well with fifth- and seventh-place finishes by first-year Emily Wobb and sophomore Cassie Wallace, respectively, with times of 18:27.38 and 19:25.90.
On the men’s side, the meet was equally successful. Senior James Hulley once again came out on top, winning the discus throw in 44.37 meters as well as the shot put, with a meet record and NCAA provisional qualifying distance of 15.95 meters. 
Sophomore Ryan Kissel also achieved excellent results, with three top-10 finishes. He placed seventh in the high jump, clearing 1.75 meters; ninth in the long jump, reaching 6.46 meters; and 10th in the triple jump, leaping 12.67 meters. Junior Pat O’Brien took sixth in the triple jump, clearing 12.81 meters. Finally, junior Dustin Musselman finished 10th in the javelin throw with 45.50 meters.
Hulley was not the only one to provisionally qualify for the NCAAs. Junior Nate Bussiere finished fourth in the 1500-meter run in 3:53.53, also a provisional cut. Bussiere also placed second in the 800-meter run with a time of 1:55.42. 
“The team performed really well,” Bussiere said. “Both James Hulley and I qualified for Nationals, and many other athletes put up personal bests for the season. If we can carry this momentum all the way to UAAs, I’m excited to see what we can do.”
The Tartans will next compete at the Washington & Jefferson Invitational. The hammer events will be held at Carnegie Mellon on April 2. The rest of the events will be hosted by W&J on April 3.

The month of March brings with it a unique season known as March Madness. College basketball teams throughout the country are entered into a pool of 65 teams, all looking to cut down the nets and win a national championship. Before this year, March Madness was usually unsurprising, with the higher-seeded teams taking care of business, whether it be in close games or just absolute blowouts. However, this year was the complete opposite, as we saw brackets being busted from the first day of the tournament.
The first day of the tournament always brings a ton of excitement. People ranging from 15-year-old high school basketball players to 60-year-old basketball gurus fill out brackets in the hopes of achieving a perfect one, which would immediately earn them countrywide fame along with $1 million from Yahoo!. Those who were watching on that first day were not disappointed.
The early set of games featured a few powerhouses, such as the always-dangerous University of Notre Dame and Villanova University. Little did we know that the two teams that they were playing, Old Dominion College and Pittsburgh’s very own Robert Morris University, would respectively produce some stunning finishes that were a sign of upsets to come. Notre Dame was upset by one point by Old Dominion, and Robert Morris brought Villanova to overtime before falling short at the buzzer.
With one upset already, the first day was looking to be extremely crazy going into the later sets of games. Some of the top seeds, such as Tennessee and Baylor, were pushed to the limits but came through at the end of the game. 
Some other teams were not so lucky. The Georgetown Hoyas, one of the favorites to reach the Elite Eight and also the Final Four, faced a matchup with Ohio State, a small, guard-oriented, three-point-shooting team that was always willing to run the court. The Hoyas came out sloppy, getting down by double digits almost immediately. Showing almost no will to make a comeback, annual powerhouse Georgetown went out in the first round to this school from central Ohio. 
Other upsets in the first day featured the ever-dangerous Murray State Racers, a low-seeded tournament stalwart the past few years. Vanderbilt had the game going into the final seconds, but a buzzer-beater from 15 feet by Murray State’s Danero Thomas plunged a dagger into Vanderbilt’s tournament hopes, sending the Racers home the victors. And of course, there are the heroics of Brigham Young University’s Jimmy Freddette, who poured in 37 points en route to a double-overtime victory against the Florida Gators.
The second day of the tournament was a bit more relaxed than the first, with the only true upset going to the Cornell Big Red, giving them their first NCAA tournament win in a long, long time. Cornell used some sweet three-point shooting and precision passing to pummel the Temple Owls, who previously had the best three-point defense in the country. 
The second-round matchups did not disappoint. One of the most talked about games this year featured the Northern Iowa Panthers against the number-one team overall, the Kansas Jayhawks. Kansas, a notoriously slow starter in games, immediately went down by eight to close out the first half. Supposedly phenomenal point guard Sherron Collins was having an awful day from the field, shooting less than 30 percent. Using a well-timed full-court press, the Jayhawks got within one point with around one minute left to play in the game. However, the Panthers broke the full-court press once, using a long outlet pass to get the ball past midcourt. 
The most defining moment for the Panthers occurred in the next five seconds. Northern Iowa’s Ali Farokhmanesh made a risky decision — to pull up and shoot a three-pointer instead of burning the clock out. It turned out to be the greatest choice of the game, as he drained the three and crushed the Jayhawks’ goals of a national championship.
The rest of the tournament also had its share of upsets, and it currently boasts the Butler Bulldogs, a five seed, the West Virginia Mountaineers, a two seed, the Duke Blue Devils, a one seed, and the Michigan State Spartans, another five seed, in the final four. Out of all these teams West Virginia looks the strongest, but Duke is coming off a huge win against Baylor, so I give them the edge for the rest of the tournament.  But, with the way this tournament is going, who am I to make an accurate prediction?

The Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team proved once again why it is a top-10 team last Saturday, after the Tartans defeated number-23 University of Mary Washington 5–4. The ninth-ranked Tartans improved to 11–4.
Right from the start, the Tartans came out swinging against the Eagles’ aggressive doubles teams, but fell short of taking the lead heading into singles. 
At the third doubles spot, juniors Bobby MacTaggart and Alex Nemerov served big and controlled the net the entire match, coming out on top, 8–4.
“We tried out a variety of doubles strategies that worked very well,” Nemerov said. “Bobby’s serve and my forehand were definitely our weapons of choice.”
Seniors Niko Ljuboja and James Muliawan almost clinched a win, but an unlucky break and a hold by the Eagles at 7–5 gave Mary Washington the win. The Tartans also dropped their second doubles match, 8–2, putting the Tartans at a 2–1 deficit heading into singles.
To take the win, the Tartans needed to win four of the six singles. Senior Jon Spero finished first, winning 6–4, 6–2 at the fifth spot to set the momentum. He was followed by Muliawan at third singles, who won 6–4, 6–1. Sophomore Jeremy King, 
substituting for first-year Harsha Rao at sixth singles, overcame his opponent 6–4, 6–4 to give the Tartans a 4–2 lead. Rounding out the group was first-year Duke Miller, who dropped only four games to clinch the match for Carnegie Mellon.
“This is the third time this season we’ve been down 2–1 after doubles and come back to win against a ranked team,” Spero said.
“You can only survive so long playing bad doubles, and we know this will catch up with us eventually. I would expect us to make some adjustments in doubles before the next match, but a positive is that we have been very consistent in singles against good teams.”
The Tartans have a week of rest before they face eighth-ranked Johns Hopkins University at home next Sunday. The Tartans will be looking for redemption after dropping a 6–3 decision in their last meeting.

With the swimming and diving season coming to a close, the Tartans finished second in the University Athletic Association (UAA) conference and sent several athletes to the national meet. After earning All-UAA honors after finishing third in the 200-yard butterfly, first year Dan Glaser-Garbrick continued on to compete at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Swimming and Diving Championships and earned an All-America honor after placing eighth in the same event. This feat is impressive for an athlete in the first year of his college athletic career, and it sets the tone for successful seasons in the years to come.
A native of Dayton, Ohio, Glaser-Garbrick swam all four years of his high school career while maintaining an accomplished grade point average. Moreover, Glaser-Garbrick competed at the state level and earned a top-eight position in the 100-yard butterfly during his final year of high school. He began swimming because his parents recognized the importance of their son having an active lifestyle. The regular exercise and enjoyment of swimming became a habit that has positively affected Glaser-Garbrick’s life. Glaser-Garbrick mentioned other types of competition that he would be interested in once his swimming career at Carnegie Mellon is over: “I would choose to do triathlons, because they involve swimming, running, and biking, all of which I enjoy doing.”
Nearing the end of his first year of college, Glaser-Garbrick notes that he was nervous upon his arrival at Carnegie Mellon; he was concerned about how to handle the workload while being on the swim team. After experiencing the life of a student athlete at the university, Glaser-Garbrick has found that swimming helps him to stay focused and use his time wisely, both to complete assignments and work hard during practices. With three years ahead of him, Glaser-Garbrick is on the way to having a successful experience as a Tartan student athlete.

The number-11 women’s tennis team traveled to the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Va. to take on the defending national champion, the Williams College Ephs. The match was very competitive, but the Tartans suffered a 7–2 loss to the number-three Ephs.
The doubles matches were played indoors due to cold weather in the morning. The number-one team of sophomore Laura Chen and junior Ashley Herrick fell 8–4 to Williams’ top team of Kristen  Alotta and Nikki Reich. The Tartans were without the services of normal second doubles player sophomore Kelly Hart, so the team of sophomore Courtney Chin and first-year Alex Tapak played the spot. Both players performed well, but lost 8–6 after Williams rallied at 6–4 to win four games straight. At third doubles, junior Jennifer Chui and sophomore Cze-Ja Tam won a two-hour marathon match, 9–8, to get Carnegie Mellon on the board.
“It was a tough match, but I’m glad Cze and I were able to fight it out for the win,” Chui said. “Williams is one of the best teams in the nation, and this match, along with the closeness of second doubles and the singles matches, shows we are not far behind them.”
The match was moved outside at the conclusion of doubles as the temperature rose 20 degrees. The Tartans suffered losses at fourth and sixth singles, but Chen won at first singles against one of the top players in the nation to extend the match and make the score 4–2. Williams was able to clinch the match when Tapak fell 6–3, 6–3 at the third singles spot. Williams got their sixth point at fifth singles as Tam suffered a 7–6, 6–2 loss. The last match on the court was Chin at number-two singles, against an opponent who has a current 42-match winning streak in her college career. Chin fought hard but lost 6–4, 6–7, 10–8. The Tartans were very close with one of the best teams in the country.
“This match was very mentally tough for everyone,” Chen reflected. “We really had to elevate our games and push ourselves one step further to stay competitive. We still have a few weeks before UAAs, so we’ll be working hard to prepare.”
The Tartans will be back in action next Saturday, when they take on the University of Mary Washington, followed by Johns Hopkins University the next day, both at home. The Tartans beat Hopkins 7–2 last month at the National Indoors and look to repeat their success.

One of the strongest sports teams on campus doesn’t even compete in Division III. The number-62 Ultimate Frisbee team (of 400 teams), boasting a 9–1 season record, is the only team to compete in Division I at Carnegie Mellon.
Most notable of their successes was the IUP Nut Buster, a 10-team tournament held in Indiana, Pa. on March 14–15. The Tartans threw better and ran faster than all seven of their opponents, including John Carroll University, Catholic University, Clarion University, Kent State University, and Bloomsburg University, to finish the weekend 7–0, which included an exciting final win against the Rochester Institute of Technology, 15–9.
Captain Jeremy Kanter is hopeful about his team’s results to come. 
“The only teams in our section that have proven they can be better than us this season are Pitt and Penn State. Penn State is a lot like us: a really hard-working group that makes up for a lack of star players by playing a fundamentally sound game top to bottom,” he said. 
“They’ve had the edge on us this year, winning all three games we’ve faced them in, but they’re a team we know we can beat if we put all the pieces together for a full game.”
Just last Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon Ultimate team tore up the field in a one-day tournament held in Shippensburg, Pa, a few hours away from Pittsburgh.
The Tartans kicked off their successful day at 9 a.m. with a match against Penn State’s B team, whom the Tartans steamrolled 13–1. In their next match, the Tartans faced the A team from the same school in an exciting battle. Despite an 8–7 lead, the Tartans let their defenses down at the last minute and fell 10–8. This loss didn’t stop Carnegie Mellon from destroying their next opponents, Dickinson College, 13–5.
Last weekend concluded the regular season for the Ultimate team. They have a break before their sectionals in two weeks, hosted by Penn State University on April 10–11.

The Carnegie Mellon golf team hit the links to start its spring season by competing in the three-day Jekyll Island Invitational last week. Held at the Oleander Course on Jekyll Island in Georgia, the 6700-yard and 72-par tournament was a good way to test the golf team’s game after its spring break trip to Florida. The Tartans shot 944 (322, 312, 310) for the tournament to place 19th out of 27 teams. The first-place team was Methodist University, with a total score of 864.
Leading the way for the Tartans was senior Brett Cannaday, who shot 234 to tie for 63rd place, one stroke ahead of sophomore teammate Michael Cheng and five ahead of senior teammate Christopher Lee.
Rounding out the Tartans were first-year Charles Windon, who shot just three behind Lee with 241, and junior Brent Driscoll with 249.
Results from the McDaniel Invitational will be posted online at www.thetartan.org.

In a move not even science could predict, Pittsburgh Pirates owner Bob Nutting revealed last Friday why he wasn't spending any significant money on improving the team: He was using the money to build a time machine. Nutting then offered a demonstration of the machine by traveling back 50 years ago to the most celebrated year in Pirates history, the year they won the World Series against the New York Yankees in stunning fashion.
Just to recap: the 1960 World Series saw the Yanks outscore the Pirates 55–27 with 16–3, 10–0, and 12–0 victories, but Pirates managed to pull it out with 6–4, 3–2, and 5–2 victories before a see-saw Game 7 that ended with Pirates second baseman Bill Mazeroski's ninth inning home run to seal a 10–9 victory and win the World Series.
"[Mazeroski's] famous home run did much more than win the World Series, it was a moment that has inspired our city and our region for 50 years," said Nutting earlier this year in a press release on the team's website. "It is a moment that continues to be passed on from generation to generation."
However, it's a moment that has now been struck from baseball history.
Once Nutting made it to 1960, he used his surplus cash to purchase the team from then-owner John Galbreath, convincing him that he "had come from the future with the secret to winning a championship." Nutting immediately implemented the same methods he uses today in running the team: already knowing the outcome of the season and the Series, he traded Mazeroski to the Yankees. Mazeroski, he said, because he hit the home run, might one day ask for more money because of it, even though history showed that "Maz" never did such a thing.
Logic would hope that Nutting would have at least traded Mazeroski for the Yanks' equally light-hitting second baseman Bobby Richardson, who, like Maz, also demonstrated uncharacteristic power during the World Series when he drove in a record six runs during Game 3. But, as Pirates fans today know, Nutting doesn't necessarily use the same logic as we do when it comes to baseball operations, and Mazeroski was traded for two Players to be Named Later.
"This is a move we deemed necessary not financially, but for the better of the team," Nutting said as he faked his way through a press conference regarding the trade. "Bill was a great piece of this franchise, and we will miss him dearly. However, the players we will eventually receive from the Yankees are sure to play a part in the rebuilding of this franchise as we work our way back toward a championship. I promise."
Mazeroski was not immediately available for comment, but a close friend quoted him as saying, "What the @#$% does that even mean?"
Nutting's only response was, "Wait and see. You'll thank me in 50 years."
Fans today are still wondering what Nutting could have been talking about, as all the move has done is removed a treasured piece of baseball history and eradicated the 2010 plan to build a statue of Mazeroski outside PNC Park, saving the team a lot of money to not spend on players.

Spotted: The CW announcing their latest project, Gossip Geek, modeled after their popular teen fantasy series, Gossip Girl Who knew that beneath their disarming exterior, dungeon masters and engineers alike could be so scandalous? Rumor has it sex, drugs, and more sex run rampant behind (well, mostly on) their computer screens.
According to Executive Creative Director Terri Bleideas, the series will follow seven students who are “geeky, antisocial, and relatively below the population average of attractiveness, but very intelligent.” 
She also said that a hip setting, such as New York in the previous series, wasn’t necessary as geeks are not expected to venture into the real world basically ever.
“It started out as a joke, to make the complete opposite of what the characters on Gossip Girl represent,” Bleideas stated. “But it blossomed into a fantastic concept that will exploit — excuse me, explore — a very non-stereotypical group of people, like on our flagship show, Gossip Girl.”
Gossip Geek will focus on two young men, Frederick van Kamp deBruyker von Pweterschmidt — a “free-spirited computer science major and notorious LAN party animal” — and Gilbert Worthington IV — an electrical engineer with intentions to rule the world (of Warcraft). 
Kristen Bell, the narrator for Gossip Girl, will be replaced by Ralph Wiggum from The Simpsons.
“Getting kicked out of the library, hacking into the school’s main server, and attempting to create a stripper robot are just a few of the big ideas we have in the works,” actor Matthew Settle said. Settle plays a parent named Rufus Humphery on Gossip Girl. “I’m not exactly sure what relevance I have in a show about rich teens, let alone geeky students, but I expect I will play guitar and act idealistic, and most likely lecture people.”
Shooting is set to begin next fall. Carnegie Mellon students, put on your glasses and take out those TI-89s, because this ride is going to get tricky.
You know you’ll like it.

Last Week President Obama flip-flopped once again and decided to send humans to Mars. But instead of sending astronauts, he is going to send death panels. Here are some stats that you may not know about death panels on Mars:
Distance from Mars to the Sun (in number of planets): 4
Future children not yet killed by death panels: 8,030,283,309
Google results for "Martian death panels": 9
Death panels required to be present for all Death Star planetary annihilations: 13
Estimated cost of sending a death panel to Mars: priceless

University officials announced today that a new version of the emergency notification system — aptly titled Alert Later — would be rolled out next month. The update will enhance the current features of the system used to notify the campus community of emergencies, adding longer delays between e-mail and text message notifications.
This project continues the administration’s effort to communicate with the university’s members. 
“With the new Alert Later system, we have brought our emergency communications system in line with what the world expects from Carnegie Mellon,” Vice President of Campus Affairs Michael Murphy said. “Our students and faculty are renowned for their poor communication skills and procrastination. By refocusing our efforts on delaying notifications, we’ve brought the alert system in line with the rest of the university.”
Some students have criticized the previous system, Alert Now, for not having a fast response time. “I trust the emergency alert system to keep me safe when there are emergencies on campus,” said Jonas Inkheim, a first-year computer science major. “When there was a fire in Wean Hall, I ignored the fire alarm, so I didn’t leave until I got my notification. I was almost consumed by the flames.” The updated system should reduce unreasonable expectations such as instant notification.
Initial tests of the post-emergency reminder system were successful, and officials expect to begin implementing it starting in late April. One beta-tester, Sammy Jordan, who was involved in both Alert Now and Alert Later development, expressed his satisfaction: “I was a little concerned back when we tested Alert Now about the half-hour delays. They seemed long for an emergency communication system. I’m happy to say that the improved hour-long delays in Alert Later are great for reminding me after an emergency is over.”
Members of the university community should remember to register for the Alert Later service at www.cmu.edu/alert. Officials aim to have registration open in the next week, but admit that the deadline may slip into next year.

With an attitude of benevolence that seems out of character for a group of individuals raking in billions of dollars annually, the Tepper School of Business is now offering opportunities for those who are less fortunate.
In a recent press release, Tepper administrators announced that they would be sharing some of the money and good fortunes promised to Tepper students at admittance with other students at Carnegie Mellon whose futures may not be filled with country clubs and sweater vests. 
Now, students in the College of Fine Arts and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences can find employment doing menial tasks such as shining shoes, tying ties, or arranging paperweights.
“We realized that, with the economic downturn, there are many students in need — and we at Tepper have the chance to help,” explained Tepper dean Kenneth B. Dunn. “Not all students have spacious offices waiting for them at graduation, but they can clean ours.”
Dunn stressed that, while the program is focusing on students graduating from CFA and H&SS, the positions will also be offered to others in need at Carnegie Mellon.
“There are many opportunities at Tepper for all students, regardless of major. We realize that many at Carnegie Mellon have other difficulties facing them at graduation — issues of social capability or presentability. Not all students can match up to the strapping young men and women of our school,” Dunn said.
“We even hope to consider staff applicants. We have already received several requests from recently canceled majors including anthropology and political science. Our students certainly don’t need education from previously employed faculty in these departments, but perhaps they could alphabetize our books or something,” Dunn added.
Recent 2008 creative writing graduate Katie Fulton took a job with Tepper’s new program after finding that, in times of economic difficulty, few people are looking for new manuscripts. When she heard about the opportunities available within Tepper,  she hesitantly applied for one of the positions.
“At first I thought that working at Tepper would have to be a last resort. And then I hit rock-bottom and realized I had to apply,” Fulton said. “Now I spend my days scrubbing those giant photos of smiling graduates. It is a little sickening, sort of like shining the image of what I have failed to become. Actually, exactly like that.”
However, not all see the positions as such dismal alternatives to jobs off campus.
“I love my job,” said 2006 design graduate Steven Hammon. “I have the opportunity to tie the loafers of future CEOs and presidents. I mean, what more could you want? In fact, I hope that they make this position a permanent one, even after the economy changes.”
No word yet on how long Tepper will continue to offer positions to graduates, but all students can be comforted by the fact that, as long as Tepper continues to give diplomas, there will always be the need for a reliable shoe shine.
Courtney Wittekind (cwitteki@) hope Tepper will give her a job too. She loves Tepper.

The tents at the Fence might have started out as a G-20 protest, but they provided the administration with unexpected inspiration and a solution for the housing problem.
Last Tuesday, Kelly Coleman, director of Alternative Campus Housing, announced that the university has decided to erect permanent tents. “We want to accommodate as many students as possible, and maybe even provide housing for some grad students, so we’ve decided to extend the tent housing plan onto the entirety of the Cut. We’re also thinking about converting the Morewood Gardens parking lot into tent housing. We feel that this is a step in the right direction,” she said.
The university plans to have these new tents erected by fall with the hope that students who didn’t make the cut during room selection will be able to live on campus. This new tent housing is being lauded as the greenest student housing in the world. Because the tents use no electricity and have no heating or running water, they will replace Stever House as the housing complex with the highest LEED ranking. Coleman expected a LEED rating of Super-Platinum with Sparkles™.
Students strangely have mixed feelings about the new tents.
“I think they’re a great idea,” said junior mechanical engineering major Sara Greene. “There are a few things to be worked out, like what we’ll do when we get a huge snowstorm, but we can cross that bridge in a blizzard. I’m glad the administration is taking notice of students’ interest in being environmentally friendly, with coffee cups and tents and stuff.”
While many, like Greene, support the new tent dorms, most are willing to admit that the plan hasn’t really been thought through yet.
“What I’d really like to know about is the whole security situation,” said John Wiggins, a sophomore computer science major. “I have six computers, and I’d only want to live in a tent if I knew they’d be, like, safe.”
“I didn’t like the tents at G-20 and I don’t like them now,” said Casey Duran, a senior in business administration. “If they fill up all the open spaces with tents, where am I going to play Ultimate?”
Despite some opposition, the administration plans to begin pitching tents soon. As the kinks continue to be worked out, Coleman invites students to submit feedback to tentdorms@thetartan.org.

A group of students normally known as organized and relatively well behaved, the model student athletes of Carnegie Mellon have been hit by a scandal.
The Carnegie Mellon police department’s excellent sleuthing has recently uncovered a steroid ring within the athletics department that involves most of the varsity sports teams. 
Student athletes have sunk to an unethical level in the company of the infamous Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire, even at our average-performing Division III school. 
Although evidence is still being uncovered, it appears that the culprits were not only involved in several popular sports, but also the men’s curling team and the cheerleading team.
Max Rodriguez, chief of Carnegie Mellon’s police department, released a statement yesterday afternoon. “I didn’t even know we had a curling team,” he said, “but we are still investigating where the drugs came from and how the teams got funding in the first place, considering most, if not all, of alumni donations go to research teaching robots how to blink.”
The second half of the statement released by the police department said, “Disciplinary action will not be pursued in the case of the teams involved.” Upon further investigation, it turns out the teams on average had a winning-to-losing ratio of 1:3.
Susie Baskin, director of athletics, did not respond to any of eight different phone calls from various members from our staff.
A male athlete, who wished to remain anonymous, said, “We were told it was an organic, fair-trade Ceylon cinnamon grounds and flax seed body rub. I’ll admit that the heavenly scent of cinnamon may have distracted me from seeing the ball properly, but steroids? That’s news to me.” 
Randomly polled students on campus were also surprised to learn that sports teams even existed, besides the chess and Buggy teams.
For the men’s curling team, disciplinary action is yet to be announced. “They were polled to be seventh of eight teams in the BALCO league, and ended up getting eighth,” Gren Anderson, the temporary double-interim dean of Student Affairs, stated. “As for the other teams, I’m not sure what punishment is appropriate. One team’s season record was 1–17, with the single win being against a team that had to forfeit because their school was snowed in. I think their terrible results are enough of a punishment.”
Courtney Chin (cachin@) is absolutely completely frightened of athletes and we need to stop talking about them.

You see them sitting alone on city buses in the early hours of the morning, perched cryptically in the dark corners of the Underground, feasting on their night’s purchase, or even peeking at you from deep within the confusing corridors of Doherty Hall — but who are they, and what is the significance of their beautiful yet seemingly daunting outerwear?
These are the caped crusaders of Carnegie Mellon; they’re here, they’re a force to be feared, and their numbers are quickly increasing. One would be surprised to find out that, in recent years, a significant population of Carnegie Mellon students have decided to get “cloaked.” 
But what does this mean for the common Carnegie Mellon student? Do these rising populations pose a threat?
“Their capes may at first appear charming,” local zoologist Yugi Oh said, “but do not be fooled. These creatures are full of unbounded mystery. We have yet to uncover the details on the species or what exactly they’re hiding under those woolly veils.”
“Dangerous” was most certainly an appropriate description when, last Tuesday, a local student was attacked after supposedly getting too close to a caped creature. 
“I was just curious,” first-year drama major Biz Natch said. “I had heard so much about the Caped Carnegies, but had never seen one in person. It looked as if it was playing some sort of game on the corner of the Cut, and as I approached, I discovered Magic cards. Apparently, the caped are protective of these paper masterworks. It leaped onto me, and I was drowning in a sea of navy and emerald-green felt.”
In order to prevent incidents like this in the future, some have proposed controlled cape-hunting as an appropriate response. In theory, members of the Carnegie Mellon community would be able to monitor cape populations through recreational game hunting. A smaller cape population would ensure increased safety around campus. This issue, however, has left the campus divided.
Those in favor of the hunt have taken action. “Do not be fwooled by dher twoothy gwins,” said University Police officer Elmer Fuddwugger in a recent address to the Carnegie Mellon community from the steps of Doherty Hall. “The cwoaked cwusaders awe dangewous. I uwge all students to cawwy protection with them at all times. It’s wawlock season.”
However, a large population of students greatly objects to the hunting of capes. 
Just last week, protesters gathered at the Fence and began posting signs with the names of their fellow capes who have already been hunted. “This symbolizes the reality of the danger that capes face every day,” senior art major Gee Twentai said. “The violence is so unnecessary. These caped creatures don’t feel as though they’re welcome, and we just want to show them that they have a home here. Here, with us, in our arms.”
Debates over the next steps are expected to continue well into the coming week, so visit www.thetartan.org for continued updates.

University Police are currently investigating an incident of robot cruelty after nine defaced mobots were found scattered around campus. University Center staff recovered the first painted mobot trying to climb the stairs in Kirr Commons and began receiving calls of similar findings from as far away as Scaife Hall. The vandals reportedly used spray chalk, a semi-permanent marking tool historically used for sorority advertising.
Robot rehabilitators have been unable to remove the spray chalk from the mobots’ exoskeletons. “Once the spray chalk eventually wears off, there’s a high probability that it’s going to gum up the mobot’s bearings,” said Milton Jangles, owner of Lube-U-Right, a mobot repair shop. 
While details are still coming out, a flock of reporters has been found photographing the mobots in their debilitated state.
Anonymous sources have pointed the finger at Kappa Lambda Omicron Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa (KLOKKKKK), the campus’ animal-rights-interest fraternity.
J.W. Ramp (jramp@) is a Contributing editor of The Tartan. He has not harmed any mobots, ever.

There are many reasons why Carnegie Mellon student-athletes quit the Tartan football team. Some quit in order to pursue academic interests; others tire of the long, drawn-out practices. 
Whatever the reason may be, these athletes still hold on to the memories of hearing the roar of their 30 fans at Gesling Stadium or lose sleep over the lingering feeling of Coach Makrinos’ saliva on their face. And now, in the spirit of recapturing their former glory, 42 retired football players have organized a new team — the Carnegie Mellon Argyles.
Derek Smaertguy, a former Tartan player and the appointed team leader of the Argyles, has issued this decree: “We, the Carnegie Mellon Argyles, have assembled a group of former CMU football players who have the athletic ability and sculpted pectorals to defeat the Tartans in a game of American football. We therefore challenge the Carnegie Mellon Tartans to a game on Thursday, April 1, at 4:20 p.m. to lay claim to the official title of the school’s football team.”
The statement continues, expressing the Argyles’ demands that if they were to emerge victorious from such a competition, all “Carnegie Mellon football home games would be played exclusively by the Argyles... unless there is homework due the next day.” 
School officials are still consulting over the team’s request. When approached for an interview, Tartans head coach Rick Lackner provided no comment.
There has been speculation on all fronts concerning who would coach the Argyles if such a game were to occur. Many names have surfaced, but leading the rumor mill is Assistant Director of Intramurals Mike Grzywinski. 
A quick look into Grzywinksi’s professional coaching background reveals that he won NCAA Tournament bracket pools 11 out of 13 years in office, is a closet addict of the popular video game NCAA Football ’10, and had a history of “playing dirty” while he was an intramural athlete. 
Grzywinksi has also been seen sporting a pair of argyle socks around campus the past few days, a possible sign of things to come.

RUSSIAN BRIDE
Single male Bolshevik seeks single female democratic centrist for GMN, EQP, TYN, XPB, and FPR.

Must be capable of breeding heirs for the glorious new republic.
CFA TALENT
Caucasian female, musical theater major seeks proven heterosexual male with lust for my talent. Requesting a night of culture in my bedroom critiquing YouTube videos of Greek Sing. After a sensible meal and frozen yogurt, if things go well, we can use my Netipot till sunrise. In the morning we’ll warm our vocals up together over my sink… but know your place: no mixing, no Elphaba. Please arrive outside Purnell Center for the Arts 30 minutes prior to the end of my rehearsal, equipped with two contrasting monologues in order for me to analyze your character flaws and the prospective length of this arrangement.
FIND MYSELF
Confused Caucasian male seeks suspicious person from last week’s Crime & Incident to “find himself with.” Prefer to meet under the veil of night somewhere like, but not restricted to: underside of Randy Pausch Bridge, lower level of Gates parking garage (would settle for stadium parking lot), Robotics Institute, Flagstaff Hill between Tech Street and that comfortable ditch, wherever the campus pastries come from, Tepper’s locker rooms, the children’s playground, by the fire alarm in Wean Hall, cellar door by the Frame, Mellon Institute colonnade, or the Purnell bike rack you were caught at a month ago. If none of these locations are convenient, please leave a note in lipstick on my bathroom mirror while I’m away.
GIRL-BOY
Female-lady-woman-girl seeks man-boy for unrealistic amounts of pleasure. Male creature will have to feel it to believe it. You have never seen me in action. It will be extreme. Masculine-sir should be male with man parts. Meet me on the Cut near the CFA steps, where I will sit looking like a feminine person waiting for you, Mr. Dog-man-guy.
BABYMAKER
Thirty-one-year-old man seeks 29.7-year-old woman for child bearing. Must not be barren. Must be willing to engage in intercourse. Must be willing to make dinner, raise family, clean house. Man not unstable. Man needs long-term plan.
YOUNG’UN
Fifteen-year-old guy who shouldn’t really be in college but I skipped two grades because my mom told me I am special wants to experience life. Has been told that to do this should have “girlfriend.” Has a friend that is a girl but mom said that doesn’t count. Girl should be developed and mature to match the strength of my intellect, which is quite large. But don’t be large in person, I am pretty small, being only 15 and having stunted growth.
**SWAMP FROG **
Green guy looking for pink gal. You should be flirty, very fierce, and a little plump. Your hair will be blonde and luxurious, your nose a snout. If you didn’t get it: in bed, I’ll be Kermit, you’ll be Miss Piggy. Under the blankets our animalistic muppetty sides will take over.
APOLOGY
Once we were in love. Once we were spending every minute together, we would smile, we would stare into each other’s eyes. We were a fairy tale. And then there was that situation with the iron, the Ethernet cable, and your cat, and I can’t apologize enough for what happened, but does it have to end this way?
**COFFEE TO GO **
You made me a drink at Starbucks. I looked into your eyes, three times. You looked back. Your name was Will and I was wearing a green sweatshirt. I have returned to Starbucks each day since then, but it seems you don’t actually work there. This and the Internet both confuse me, thus my missed connection is being written in a spot where personal ads go. Not on Craiglist because I don’t know what that is. Find me. 
RESEARCH ASSISTANT
Husband and wife professor team seeks young attractive graduate student for research. Activities may include: laboratory experimentation, Chatroulette user studies, and long random walks on the beach.
GREEK LUST
Carnegie Mellon seeks new fraternities. We are a top university hoping to fill our Greek quad with a set of intentionally selected fraternities that are right for our campus environment. Fraternities with foci on vegans, Internet meme-spreading, anti-social behavior, and anything that doesn’t involve parties with alcohol would be just great. 
INFOGRAPHICALUST
Bar chart seeks line graph to smooth out my corners. Ideally data-rich and chart-junk-light. You will find me on page one where we can cuddle up together above my credit. No pie chart fatties need apply.
WANDERING BARD
Voice major seeks anyone who is willing to stand within 15 feet as I blast showtunes walking through campus. Knowledge of Italian, French, or Latin a plus. Ability to harmonize will be considered upon audition. Male, female, anything with a good noise tolerance is welcome to respond. Auditions for groupies and long-term relationships will be held on sidewalks around campus on the next sunny day.

November 2009, if you’ll cast your minds back through time, is when we might have first noticed the eruption from the Cut of a small house-like structure. In the tranquility of smooth green grass, a cottage of odd aroma and form emerged partially from the ground, peeking out at the world around it.
Little did we know that this quiet structure was one of our last reminders of the previous year’s fallen architecture students, recently found in the Monongahela River. Police have reported that the groundwater pushed the bodies from the site into the river channels, where they were found with a look of disappointment and a final review clutched in their fists.
These students had fallen into a stressful vortex, described as a labyrinth of T-squares and coffee cups. The one surviving witness who fled the department, now hiding in Homewood and wishing to remain anonymous, relayed his experiences of escaping this swift and disastrous fate: “As I was kicking one of the plotters into working order the night before our review, I heard what I thought was a performance piece gone awry on the third floor.”
Unknown to this former student, the collective stress of CFA had formed a quantum spiritual-magnetic connection to a crypt that had been forgotten since the days of Andrew Carnegie, 300 feet under Carnegie Mellon’s Cut, resulting in a small yet disastrous tectonic plate shift.
“The poplar windows of our hall were ripped from the side of CFA, coincidentally forming the most beautiful semi-detached structure I could imagine, and as I sketched it with a segmented arch to impress that girl who sleeps next to me under our cluster tables, I watched her fly out of the conical intersect.... I never returned her protractor.”
Fortunately, our witness slammed his ribs between a fallen transom bar and a canyon of inefficiently used materials, saving his life. Were he not so lucky, his body, mind, and soul would have passed through a hellish obstacle course culminating in the deep soil of Pittsburgh’s watershed.
Let us all take a moment now to bask in the recent sunshine, showering an ominous glow and twinkling silent memorial on the metal stakes that still mark their point of departure from this plane.

Considering the amount of fear in the world today, it is no wonder that the Apocalypse is on many people’s minds. On the top of the list of potential disasters are nuclear war, natural disaster, disease, and future elections. To account for the rise in world destruction pre-planning, scientists have renovated the design of the Doomsday Clock, moving from the face-and-hands model of the 1950s into the digital era of today.
The Doomsday Clock was first created by scientists following the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan in 1945. It displayed a countdown until “midnight” — the point of global atomic warfare. Over the years, the clock has been reset multiple times, and it currently is set at six minutes to midnight.
Chairperson of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Matthias Killa said: “The digital Doomsday Clock will do away with such unrefined representation.” The new clock will not only record changes in the worldwide nuclear situation down to the femtosecond, but it will also have an alarm set to go off whenever the world has been too peaceful for too long. There are rumors that it will also glow in the dark.
“In recent years,” said clock designer Phyllis Yee, “there have been many new threats that we need to account for. The clock is simply a more refined way to track... everything.” Calculating the distance to Armageddon obviously is largely influenced by the ongoing threat of nuclear war. However, other variables included in the new clock are international peace levels, the current approval rating of the American President, disease rates, ongoing military conflicts, number of living scientists, number of whales saved yearly, rate of incoming browser crash reports because of Flash plug-ins, number of people who think the current Homeland Security threat level is orange, speed of a Toyota car when it won’t stop, number of people currently on board the International Space Station, rate of volcanic eruptions in Iceland, number of licks to the center of a Tootsie Pop, number of children currently scared by monsters in their closets, number of people who think the current Homeland Security threat level is yellow, duration of sunspots, length of Pinocchio’s nose, current players on EVE, whether or not Punxsutawney Phil most recently saw his shadow, decibels of drunkenness on Brooklyn’s streets, count of remaining LOST candidates, ratio of Team Edward to Team Jacob members, veracity of Apple fanboys for the iPad, number of people who don’t know the current Homeland Security threat level, Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber album sales, and a few others that Yee thought she might have forgotten.
Variable inclusion has been a contentious process. Theologians suggest more information focusing on, among other things, the number of sinners in the world and the validity of prior rapture predictions. Secularists, on the other hand, voted on a single quotient that weighed only the existence of God. The fight is expected to be long and dubious.
While there has not been a release date announced for the digital Doomsday Clock, tentatively named Doomsday Clock: Forever, it will launch before December 2012. Killa added, “We want to make sure it works, and think that would just be the most perfect test.”

At an executive meeting last Thursday Oxford University Press decided to no longer require punctuation in their published works 
Because of the high price of publishing punctuation becomes expensive especially during these difficult economic times said Oxford publisher Perry Udd Omitting punctuation from books and articles would save about 3 percent of the resources used to publish items including printing paper and ink
Possibly the most controversial implication is the retraction of the Oxford comma The convention is used after the penultimate item in a written list Udd claims that commas make up over 40 percent of punctuation in the English language more so in the pieces we publish This would have serious implications when considering our budget Removing commas especially the Oxford kind would also compromise the comprehensibility of a text Without them lists of items would be ambiguously related to each other For example Nelson Mandela could be accidentally referred to as an 800 year old demigod and a dildo collector Thats what Peter Ustinov did in his documentary film Planet Ustinov
Another thing to consider with these cuts is the cost of copy editing added Udd Since there are fewer standards of style sans punctuation we can hire a less expensive copy staff In fact according to a recent Oxford study most copy errors that happen deal with clarifying ambiguities with punctuation Udd continued This is a waste of time but the simpler procedure could expedite the production process
A copy editor from Oxford agreed Our readers will figure it out Besides it will make them smarter by exercising their critical thinking skills We all know that every sentence begins with a capital letter all possessive pronouns precede a noun questions have question words or special syntax and clauses can be intuitively deciphered Right I mean theres no punctuation in speech Therearentevenwordboundaries

In a surprise announcement yesterday, the National Science Foundation (NSF) released its grant schedule for the 2011 fiscal year. The agency normally allocates $4 billion to distribute to researchers around the country, and many Carnegie Mellon professors commonly apply for NSF grants. “The NSF is one of our primary sources of project funding. Most of our operating budget, and my stipend, come from the NSF,” said James Fisher, a graduate student in chemistry, before the announcement.
To Fisher and many others’ dismay, the NSF announced that it would not be allowing applications for any grants for 2011. “After lengthy deliberations, we decided it was just really hard to give out all that money,” NSF Director Arden Bement Jr. said. Instead, all $4 billion will be used to buy Fiji, which will be renamed “Utopia.” Utopia will be “a paradise of science, with the laws of thermodynamics as a basis for the judiciary,” according to Bement.
Though Utopia may be a haven for antisocial scientists worldwide, some in the academic community are not pleased. Carnegie Mellon Vice President for Research Richard McCullough criticized the NSF, claiming, “This decision will put America behind in science and technology.” He added that this was because “all the scientists would leave America.”
While many scientists we talked to were concerned about the absence of NSF grants in their continued quest for tenure, others were excited about the opportunities in Utopia. Candace McMaster, a Utopia-invited cellular biologist, said, “The research equipment they showed in the presentation today does seem to be the highest quality in the world; however, I am not sure who will staff the local Starbucks.” 
Senior researcher Madeline Huhtamok had even higher expectations for Utopia, letting The Tartan know she hoped “it is going to turn out just like that movie with the blue people, except not the part where they log the whole thing and try to kill everyone. That movie was great.”

Dear children and elders,
This week, we at The Tartan have spent some time creating an issue in honor of April Fool’s Day. 
It contains many things, some real, some less real, and a few which may be complete fabrications. 
While many of the events, names, places, officials, and acts may seem as if they could be real, they are frequently fiction under the protection of satire. 
The same goes for any seemingly true event we have described. If these acts do later come true, we apologize in advance for our foresight.
We intend that this issue will amuse you, but unfortunately we can make no such promises. 
We will however ask that you kindly put your lawsuits away and simply enjoy the ride.
Patrick Gage Kelley (pkelley@) did not write this. It is all a lie. Everything is a lie. (Even the cake)

With the recent creation of the Department of Organized Relationships (DOOR), you can expect to see a lot less ogling and drooling and a whole lot more awkward first dates and hand-holding across campus. DOOR is expected to begin doing work this coming fall — just in time if you ask me, since the class of 2014 is looking like one of the least-attractive groups to come through Carnegie Mellon in years, clearly an impressive feat.
This brand spankin’ — and I mean the naughty kind — new department will lead the fight against virginity on campus by matching students based on a whole bunch of dimensions of personalities most of you didn’t even know you had. All of the best and worst traits for every student on campus will be kept in safe-like, yet unlocked, desks and drawers in a room under surveillance. Using all this highly sensitive and not-so-well protected information, DOOR will try to match students as best they can — but you must remember that for some special people, there just is no hope.
The organization’s stated agenda includes many fine goals such as reducing the sales of the “Sex Kills… Come to CMU and Live Forever” T-shirts by at least 50 percent, increasing the amount of cuddling by 25 percent, and boldly stating that they hope to decrease the time spent in clusters by 1 percent. 
When told of the latter goal, junior computer science major Nerdsome McGoo said, “Just you wait, the Final Fantasy XIV beta launches tomorrow. I’ll never surrender to the female horde!” before wheezing and beginning a high-pitched maniacal laugh that continued for seven of the most awkward minutes of my life.
Despite this virgin’s attitude, there is plenty of potential for the new department to be a success, even in such a black hole for love as Carnegie Mellon. Already there seem to be signs of change on campus. 
For example, at the ribbon-cutting ceremony in front of the newly named Grope Hall, two unidentified students immediately began making out, right in front both of DOOR’s newly appointed deans: the Dean of Attractive Students and the Dean of Unattractive Students. The crowd broke into to oohs and aahs, as if they’d never before seen lips make contact with lips. The Dean of Unattractive Students, Anna Lovely, shouted, “Those are my kids!” while the Dean of Attractive Students shielded her eyes from that display of ugly love.
And don’t be upset if your initial arranged relationship isn’t exactly up to your standards — besides, you should have thrown any standards away as soon as you walked onto this campus. DOOR will be offering students 18 arranged meet-ups per semester, with serial rejectees eventually being sent for likability workshops and community service in desolate areas.
As a stopgap measure while DOOR continues to fully implement the “DOOR Matching” system planned for the fall, the two deans have partnered with The Tartan to begin providing space to print personal ads for students who “just can’t wait that long.” Lovely believed this program should start immediately, so with her deanly approval, we present to you our first installment of DOOR personal ads:

If you saw her you would never guess.
Our conventional image of a Carnegie Mellon computer science major is a short dork in glasses who has no idea how to begin a conversation. But this girl I know is tall, fit, extremely attractive, and an amazing speaker. And a prostitute.
I had been struggling with advanced programming and I needed a tutor; she needed a tutee and some quick cash. Walking into Hunt Library I saw her, a lady who seemed very focused on her education; that is, focused on her education during the day, and spending evenings trolling Craigslist and street corners.
She was a great tutor, motivating and truly inspiring. Then one day, I was in the South Side when I saw my tutor standing on the street in a short, frilly, lacy black dress with high heels on. Her face was caked with makeup and fire-alarm-red lipstick. For days I wondered if it was possible — could my tutor actually be selling her body?
I hadn’t believed the rumors until she confessed her story to me. She told me that there were many men on the Internet, some dying to have her pretend to be their classic, college girlfriend, most just wanting sex, and some fat and ugly who could never look at a woman any other way. She gave me the names of boys on campus that bought her services, but these details are private. If I shared these it would be a scandal. 
She said she worked as a prostitute because the university is expensive and the bills need to be covered. She claimed that there were at least a hundred girls like her on campus — each hiding her secret and her client list from the others. The reality is that prostitution still exists as one of the most popular career choices, even if it’s sidelined to the dark corners of society. But if you see that six-foot-tall, gorgeous girl with the 39-inch bust — don’t be surprised, she might be offering you services in programming or pleasure.
Her name was Barbie, and while they might portray her between sheets of cardboard as a plastic computer engineer, now you know that she doesn’t just have a day job.

Fog that tends to conceal the driveway during the early hours will no longer be a major problem for drivers after General Motors R&D announced the development of technology that turns the entire windshield into an electronic display.
Few heads-up-display (HUD) projects make it past the prototype stage, in spite of their clear benefits. General Motors is trying to change that by working in tandem with Carnegie Mellon and the University of Southern California in order to devise one of the most advanced HUD systems the automotive industry has seen. 
Scientists and lab technicians at GM’s global research and development in Warren, Mich., are trying to develop a system that gathers information through a variety of built-in sensors and cameras.
According to a GM Media press release, the device can project images onto the surface of a windshield. “We’re looking to create enhanced vision systems,” said Thomas Seder, the project’s lab manager at GM R&D. The innovative technology involves utilizing compact ultraviolet lasers that take information in from the vehicle’s surroundings and process it rapidly.
“Enhanced vision systems” utilize lasers to highlight road edges, speed limit signs, and other such vital bits of information for drivers during fog-filled commutes. 
Since the surface of the windshield is wide, the system is able to alert drivers of potential dangers that exist either outside the driver’s field of vision or in a blind spot. Common hazards, such as small children and motorcyclists that often go unnoticed, can more easily be seen by drivers. Needless to say, the windshield could make driving easier and safer. Night vision will be greatly enhanced, and general navigation will be made easier due in large part to the camera-based sensors that will improve visibility and object detection ability.
The windshield is layered with transparent phosphors that emit visible light when stimulated by light from the compact laser. As specified by www.autoevolution.com, the windshield acts as a large transparent display as opposed to current HUD systems that use only a small section of the windshield. The technology improves on other HUD screens that GM first launched back in 1988. The deliberate design helps focus the driver’s attention on the road ahead by displaying important information such as speed and warning messages directly in front of the driver’s line of vision. Since drivers do not need to angle their heads down to see instruments at a lower level, driving while checking for hazardous conditions is made easier.
“That’s so awesome!” said first year-CIT student Vishal Jeet when he heard about GM’s project. “This sounds like it’s straight out of one of those sci-fi movies or one of those jet fighter games. If nothing else, it makes driving more interesting.”
There are those, however, who feel like HUD systems can cause problems for the driver. “I can’t imagine how colorful images on the windshield will not be a distraction and cover the driver’s vision,” said first-year CIT student Raghav Behl. “I just can’t see how useful this actually is. If anything, it will just make drivers dependent on the system to detect all hazards,” Behl said.
Although the technology has not yet been assigned to a GM vehicle program, Seder has stated that it could end up in cars in the foreseeable future.

For nearly 150 years, physicists around the world have been trying to work out the intricate details of various quantum mechanical phenomena. More recently, much thought has gone into making quantum computing possible — a move seen by many as essential for the world of computing to truly progress. In the race to come up with quantum mechanics-based devices, physicists lost to algae. According to Greg Scholes, lead author of a study published in Nature, algae have been using quantum mechanical processes to perform photosynthesis for over 2 billion years.
As is well known, plants convert light energy into the plant equivalent of food, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), in a process called photosynthesis. Plants perform photosynthesis by harnessing light energy to react carbon dioxide with other simple compounds to make more complicated sugars for later use. During photosynthesis, light is absorbed by organelles inside of the plant cells called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain a number of photosynthetic reaction centers where the complex sugars are generated with the help of light-capturing pigment called chlorophyll. This pigment gives plants their green color.
This model adequately explained photosynthesis for decades. However, scientists have suspected the use of quantum mechanics at some point during this process, as the process seems uncannily efficient with the harnessing and usage of light. Until early this year, this idea was widely publicized, but with little proof or understanding of the role of quantum mechanics in the process. To provide some hard scientific proof, scientists at the University of Toronto conducted a battery of tests on a common algae called cryptophytes, and they have shown that the algae do indeed utilize quantum mechanical phenomena to help improve the efficiency of photosynthesis.
The study highlighted the role of certain proteins referred to as antennae. Antennae intercept incoming photons and redirect them to the photosynthetic reaction centers, performing a function that puzzled scientists for years, as it seemed redundant. The reaction centers are fully capable of receiving light themselves without any assistance. It is this apparent redundancy that aroused such interest in the antenna proteins. The team led by Scholes fired low-power laser light in very short bursts at the algal cells and studied the electron transmission patterns using a second laser.
Under normal circumstances, energetic photons transfer their energy to electrons in atoms. These electrons then vibrate at a frequency related to the amount of energy imparted to them. With time, however, these vibrations attenuate, or lose intensity, and the electrons return to their initial states of lower energy. Scholes’ team noticed that, in the algal cells, the excited electrons remained in a state of higher energy for a period 20 times longer than normally possible. This is due to a quantum mechanical phenomenon known as quantum coherence.
Quantum coherence was discovered while conducting an experiment called Young’s double-slit experiment, using electrons instead of light. The experiment involves passing a stream of electrons through a screen with two parallel slits in it. When the electrons hit a target on the other side of the screen, the result is an interference pattern similar to that obtained by passing light waves through the slits.
This means that, unlike previously believed, once within the cell, light is transmitted not as photons but as waves. This also means that photons (or any particle small enough) are capable of doing things that might seem unreal. One example of this is a possible reason Scholes has proposed this mechanism. He believes it may be possible for every photon to decide which path to the reaction center is the most energy efficient and travel to the target via that particular best path. “That vibrating electron could put some feelers out and see which path to take,” Scholes said. This ensures light travels from the antenna to the reaction center without any loss of energy, improving the efficiency of photosynthesis.
This study shows the possibility of quantum phenomena occurring at room temperature in biological systems. Graham Fleming, a chemist at the University of California at Berkeley, who performed some earlier experiments on the same topic, predicted this possibility. He feels this is a general feature of all photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes.
Scholes’ study could dramatically improve our present light-capturing and light-sensitive devices. Considering the present efficiency of solar cells, with a record efficiency of around 40 percent for a particular prototype under test conditions, this could come as a pleasant find for the renewable energy industry.

Many people have daily habits and nervous tics. Some people bite their nails; others crack their knuckles. But when dangerous habits become compulsive or even an obsession, it may be a sign of an addiction.
Addictions can take many forms, although scientifically they only represent behaviors that will harm an organism if not stopped. 
However, in everyday terms, addiction can present itself as any sort of compulsive behavior.
Probably one of the most common addictions today is smoking. According to www.alternet.org, one-fifth of the world’s population, or 1.2 billion people, are smokers. The habit-forming chemical in cigarettes is nicotine, a natural chemical found in certain plants, including those of the Solanaceae family, of which tobacco is a member.
In our body, only a few chemicals can cross the blood-brain barrier, which is the physical separation between the bloodstream and the brain involving capillary walls. For example, oxygen molecules and hormones can cross this barrier. Nicotine can also pass into the brain, and it is in the brain that it binds to and activates cell receptors. Cell receptors are present on the surface of cells, and when certain molecules attach to them, they affect neurotransmitter production.
Nicotine causes cells to release more neurotransmitters such as dopamine, which cause feelings of relaxation and euphoria. Nicotine can also activate receptors in other parts of the body, causing the release of chemicals such as epinephrine and endorphins. Some of these chemicals are naturally associated with reduced feelings of pain and increased alertness. However, other chemicals in cigarette smoke are known carcinogens, substances that cause cancer.
Addiction to other drugs, such as cocaine or heroin, works similarly to nicotine. They artificially increase the levels of certain chemicals in the body that cause feelings of euphoria. Because drugs work with a greater effectiveness than natural chemicals, the body starts to depend on the drugs rather than natural chemicals to achieve the same physical feelings, causing an addiction.
Alcoholism is another common addiction. According to www.mayoclinic.com, drinking alcohol alters the chemical composition in the brain. One important chemical, GABA, is increased. This causes depression of the nervous system and makes the drinker feel relaxed and happy, but also uncoordinated and confused. Dopamine production is also increased, as with smoking.
Over time, chemical imbalances cause drinkers to feel a need for alcohol to be relaxed or happy again. However, as the tolerance to alcohol increases, the amount of alcohol one needs to drink to restore an adequate amount of chemicals is increased. Alcoholism may eventually cause serious diseases including cirrhosis of the liver, cognitive problems, and epilepsy. Death may also be a consequence of alcoholism.
Many factors, including age and gender, are responsible for an individual becoming addicted to any drug. In addition, genetics play a role in how easily one becomes addicted to certain drugs. For example, people with a family history of alcoholism may be more likely to become alcoholics.
Addictions can also manifest themselves as compulsive behavior or an inability to control impulses. Oniomania is a medical term for an addiction to shopping. People with this disorder often find themselves irritable when they are not shopping, or always think about buying. In addition, shopping becomes so sustained that other activities, like working at a job, become compromised, leading to financial hardship.
A gambling problem, or ludomania, causes people to become preoccupied with gambling. They may think constantly about winning and may bet higher and higher wagers to sustain a “rush” feeling. Often other people are affected by people with gambling addictions.
Another addiction that has only recently existed is an Internet addiction. According to www.nurseweek.com, this addiction was first created as a hoax, but has become accepted as a psychological condition. Usually, Internet addiction is described in subcategories, like obsessive social networking site usage and excessive Internet shopping.
All addictions can be characterized by withdrawal symptoms when the behavior is stopped. According to www.aafp.org, these withdrawal symptoms can include irritability, depression, physical sickness such as nausea, and even insomnia. However, all addictions can be treated through psychological counseling and support from friends and family. It is never too late to rehabilitate an addict.

Semiconducting ink makes RFID tags
Researchers at Sunchon National University in South Korea and at Rice University in Houston have developed a way to make Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags significantly less expensive. These tags are already used in many applications as a substitute for barcodes, since it is much easier to scan them by simply pointing a scanner in their general direction. However, conventional tags are not used for disposable items since they are made using expensive silicon and cost 50 cents per tag.
The new discovery uses paper and semiconducting ink to bring the cost down to as little as three cents per tag. The ultimate goal is one cent. The ink is made up of carbon nanotubes, which play the part of silicon in the tag.
RFID tags may eliminate lines at the supermarket, said James M. Tour of Rice University. He noted that “you could run your cart by a detector and it tells you instantly what’s in the cart.”

Artificial mother-of-pearl produced
Nacre, or mother-of-pearl, is a unique substance. It is flameproof, flexible, and strong. However, it hard to come by and is sourced primarily from shellfish. Previous attempts at creating it artificially required a great deal of labor to create even a small amount.
Scientists at the Helsinki University of Technology have developed a method of combining hard clay particles and soft synthetic polymer to produce thin, foot-long sheets of mother-of-pearl in minutes. While there remains some work to be done to remove impurities and improve toughness, the material is already extremely heat resistant. Its creators envision it being used as a cheap way to fireproof buildings and as a component in the protective armor used by soldiers and police officers. Its ability to block oxygen also makes it useful to manufacturers of electronics as a protective casing for sensitive electronics.

Revolutionary boat hopes to circle globe
Frenchman Alain Thebault, captain of the Hydroptere, hopes to halve Phileas Fogg’s circumnavigation time and simultaneously break the world record of circumnavigating the world in a sailboat. His boat is similar to a hydrofoil in that it actually “flies” a few meters above the water with only small “wings” present below the water to anchor the boat.
The fact that only a small fraction of the boat is actually immersed in the water reduces drag and allows the boat to reach speeds of 70 miles an hour. The boat will be powered by wind alone. While the plan is risky, Thebault plans to build a larger version of his boat, to be called the Hydroptere Maxi, that he believes will be able to handle the difficulties of an ocean crossing. While the Maxi, will be ready by 2013, he has another goal closer at hand: He wants to cross the Pacific Ocean in three days in 2011.

With every change of season comes a change of wardrobe, and with the incoming warm weather this spring, be sure to update your closet with the hottest trends;
Wardrobe must-haves
The casual blazer
Whether fitted or loose, the casual blazer is the perfect addition to your wardrobe. Blazers work universally. When used as a light jacket, are perfect for those breezy spring days. This year’s most chic blazers can be found in the spring 2010 lines of Burberry, Phillip Lim, Zac Posen, and Chloé.
Females should, try a fitted blazer with dark jeans, high-heeled boots, and a frilled, colorful cami. The blazer should cinch at your waist to create an hourglass figure while adding a hint of urban sophistication to the colorful pattern of your spring top. If you’d rather wear a loose-fitting boyfriend blazer, try pairing it with a high-waisted cotton skirt, V-neck T-shirt, and a powerful 
accessory. Your blazer will create a contrasting high-fashion vibe against to contrast casual cotton ensemble, and a colorful scarf, a hairpiece, or big sunglasses will perfect the look. 
Guys should sophisticate their everyday jeans and white T-shirt combo with a casual blazer. Finish this look with a pair of high-tops or colorful sneakers. The double blazer was one of the feature aspects of Milan’s fashion week. Roberto Cavalli layered his spring 2010 blazers with denim and khaki in his Milan show, and inspired audiences with his scorched sand colors and exotic patterns.
Flowery sundresses and jumpers
Recently, our generation’s childhood wardrobes have inspired several reinvented fashion trends: large hair bows, pastel leggings, baby-doll cuts, and most relevantly, floral sundresses and jumpers. Brightly colored floral fabrics are hot right now; they can be found in the spring 2010 Christopher Kane, Erdern Moralioglu, and Ralph Lauren lines. Coincidentally, floral was a prevailing theme in this year’s Paris Fashion Week as well. 
Marie Claire suggests pairing a floral dress with a leather jacket for a more rugged look, or with a loose earthy knit for a more bohemian feel.  The most popular sundresses have wide straps and a soft, round neckline. Feel free to spice up a floral dress with a solid-colored pashmina and a classy pair of wedges.
High-waisted pants, skirts, and shorts
If you haven’t caught on to the high-waisted trend as of yet, now would be the time to do it. High-waisted bottoms have been all over the fashion scene ever since the spring of 2008. The high waist is flattering on a woman; it hugs the thinnest part of her torso and veils her hips in fabric. These high-waisted bottoms have been all over the catwalk in the lines of Nanette Lepore and Emilio Pucci, and were the focus of Laqui Demkiw’s most recent London Fashion Week collection. 
When choosing a high-waisted bottom you have several options. You can try a narrow or full high-waisted skirt, either thin or full. A thin skirt protrudes less from your waist and is typically made of cotton or another soft casual material. This skirt is perfect for everyday dressing when paired with a V-neck T-shirt or colorful blouse. You can also try a full high-waisted skirt, which is usually given a bowl shape and made of a more formal material like a sheer or silk. Make sure to purchase a skirt with an elastic waist — the piece will be more comfortable and will move with your body. Avoid pairing your high-waisted skirt with ruffles or a top with extra fabric, as you don’t want your ensemble to look too busy. 
Many designers have also become fans of the high-waisted shorts and pants. While pretty much anyone can properly pull off a high-waisted skirt, pants or shorts will only look right on certain body types. High-waisted skinny jeans are adorable, but it can be difficult to find the proper top and accessories to pair with the look. Keep in mind that if you choose a pair of high-waisted jeans, the heavier fabric will act like a corset and may become awfully uncomfortable on hotter spring days. 
Trendy spring accessories
Messenger bag/purse
This fashion trend is both sensible and adorable. The tiny messenger purse or bag is the perfect size to fit all  of your necessities — your cell phone, wallet, lip balm, and iPod — and, because it is strapped around your torso, it is the perfect city accessory. Messenger bags are safe as well as trendy; you always have your belongings in plain sight, and the bag itself can’t be lost when it is draped around your body. 
Messenger bags can also make great book bags. Backpacks can load a lot of stress onto your back and often make you sweaty and uncomfortable in hotter weather. The bulkiness of a backpack can weigh you down and create a turtle-shell effect, while a messenger bag works with your body.
For men, a messenger bag can be the perfect final accessory for a collegiate look; pair it with a casual blazer and a pair of Vans and you’re ready to go. Urban Outfitters sells great casual messenger bags and purses, but The North Face makes some interesting bags that are very functional as well. 
Elastic belt
In both the fall and spring 2010 fashion week catwalk lines of VPL, Marc by Marc Jacobs, and Proenza Schouler, the elastic belt may have been the most useful fashion accessory. Outfit feeling a bit shapeless? Strap an elastic belt around that hobo-boho sweater or baby-doll dress and watch as your figure magically reappears. Gather a loose-fitting jacket and cinch it gracefully at your waist to lighten your silhouette. The belted possibilities are endless. Consider purchasing a wide elastic clasp belt from American Apparel to strap around that blazer or sundress for a tailored look. 
Unusual hosiery
Patterned tights may possibly be one of the most entertaining trends of the new season. Whether tattered and torn for the grunge look, or puckered and paired with a tutu, a festive choice of tights or leggingds is the perfect accessory to spice up your wardrobe this spring. “Allow us to introduce you to our latest leg wear crush: patterned tights. Semi-sheer and ’80s-inspired, these wispy stockings are turning up on lovely legs around the world,” raved fashion blogger Penny Lane of www.whowhatwear.com. “We adore the way they perk up an all-black outfit.”
Several designers have chosen to incorporate patterned or textured hosiery in their latest lines. Balenciaga featured polka dot tights in their spring 2010 fashion show, while the New York Fashion Week runways were littered with the accessory. Expect to see some pretty creative colors and patterns this spring.
Spring booties and heels
Everyone is bound to get sick of their flip-flops or their “reliable” pair of flats, but it’s hard to find shoes to wear when you’re sick of sandals in springtime. Think “high-heeled” by pairing your everyday ensemble with a bootie, wedge, or strappy heel. Boots were a popular trend this fall with an influx of new creative designs; however, the popular booties have carried us right into spring. These shoes cut at your ankles and are super adorable when paired with skinny jeans or sheer leggings. Do be careful, however, as booties tend to cut the length of one’s legs drastically. 
For a more casual heel, try a pair of simple wedges or strappy heels. Wedges are often a popular choice, as they are sturdy and easy to walk in. Wedges were especially common in Milan’s spring 2010 fashion week, making appearances in the lines of Dolce and Gabbana, Fendi, Marni, Moschino, and Frankie Morello. 
The snow has melted and it is finally time for your undercover fashion fanatic to emerge from hibernation. If you’re looking to reinvent yourself this spring, revamping your wardrobe may be the perfect way. Follow the lead of your fellow students and jump into the new season on a positive note with these trends. Together, we can all make Carnegie Mellon just a little bit more fashionable.

Volume Two by She and Him exhibits the heavily produced but also heavily edited quality, conservative song length, and wholly saccharine nature of the Omaha Sound. And there is something charming about a set of songs with no abrasions, violent breaks, or spots of darkness. This ain’t no Beyoncé album. If you are looking for the party song, the power-walking song, the song to be angry with, or the song to cry to, look elsewhere. The tunes dip and twang like 21st-century doo-wop, lyrics scaling most everything there is to say about romance. I can imagine looking out at the crowd of a live show, the audience rocking and tapping a foot, entranced by the noise, countenance a satisfied smirk busy with musings on lost and unrequited love.
As the title would imply, Volume Two is the continuation of a 2008 album. (Bet you can’t guess what that one’s called.) The albums play together with fluidity; for the albums like the songs that comprise them, cohesion is the rule. Once again, the unlikely conjunction of M. Ward and Zooey Deschanel is so natural that you forget when the instrumental parts begin and the singing ends. Wait, she acts, too?
Of course, you’re skeptical of the actress-singer-model. You should be! On first listen, I thought, “Oh, okay. She’s like Annie Erin Clark of St. Vincent without the talent and intelligence.” But by the end of the album, I grew to appreciate the dearth of glittery extremities. Deschanel’s voice is mellifluous and trained. It never seems to really be aware of what it is singing — or better yet, has just gotten past it. But the best part is it doesn’t emit a single crack or flourish of exaggerated emotion (“I can see your halo”). The smooth delivery is utterly satisfying, and, when you listen to the lyrics, it makes the emotional pull that much more forceful. If Volume Two moves you, it will not be because of its edge, but because of its lack thereof. Deschanel lingers vocally on the “r”s like Kimya Dawson — an endearing quirk. She couldn’t perform these songs in outrageous costumes or to Haitian victims, and that’s okay.
If there is a serious weakness to the album, it is a lyrical awkwardness. Every once in a while when you’re really getting into it, Deschanel will spit out an unrelatable metaphor: “I followed you back to the end of the path, but I never found the door.” But when the lyrics hit, they hit dead on. The seeming simplicity of the instrumentation, which was actually arduously plotted, is mimicked in lyrics like, “I think about you, then / I think about you again / and again.”
M. Ward doesn’t need a lot of noise to create an idealistic haze behind the vocals. The background music persists with unprecedented clarity in a blog-formulated world that appoints a thousand variations of lo-fi to its highest offices. I couldn’t list many other artists who can make guitars and pianos sound like Washed Out at his “chilliest.”
The first two releases by She and Him don’t do everything. They actually kind of only do one thing. They hold you up and keep you there for the duration of their play time, marinating you in an “it’s all right” attitude, which is, I’d argue, one thing damn worth doing. Everything is romance, but a self-conscious adolescent romance, nothing about being “crazy in love.” Nothing too fierce for lying in the grass or doodling at a café.

Butch Walker & the Black Widows
When the lights dimmed on a roaring audience this past Thursday night, one could barely make out the faint outline of the lone man standing onstage. Suddenly, the chords of a guitar twanged and a spotlight lit up upon the man as he jumped about the stage and belted into the microphone. After a moment, the rest of the band members began to trickle on stage and pick up their instruments, adding to the momentum already building behind the show.
“I’m Butch Walker and these are the Black Widows,” he said, gesturing to those on stage with him.
Walker was born in Cartersville, Ha. in 1969 and gained prominence as a strong performer in numerous bands in the 1980s. After being a member of both Marvelous 3 and SouthGang, he decided to start his solo career in 2002. During this time, he also wrote hit songs for other artists, including Pete Yorn, Fall Out Boy, The All-American Rejects, Weezer, and Dashboard Confessional. His latest album, I Liked It Better When You Had No Heart, was released on Feb. 23, under the name Butch Walker & the Black Widows.
The set they played Thursday was high in energy. With lots of encouragement from the band for crowd participation, the audience sang along, clapped with the beat, and screamed wildly. Walker entertained the audience with amazing tricks, like throwing his guitar pick under his leg and catching it in midair, or throwing his guitar across the stage to a roadie near the end of a song.
“I’m doing good. I’m doing better than good. I’m having fun,” Butch remarked halfway through the show, a feeling obviously echoed by all members of the audience.
During a song in which Walker played the banjo, Pat Monahan of Train walked onstage with a gigantic mustache on his face, much to the amusement of the audience, and started singing with Walker. The crowd’s cheering and laughter could be heard throughout the show. No doubt about it, everyone was enjoying themselves.
The set ended with what could only be described as an epic performance. Midway through the song, Walker jumped on a drum and played his guitar behind his head. After jumping off, he proceeded to break three strings at once. By the end of the song, all but one of the strings was broken.
“I had more fun watching them perform than any other band I’ve seen,” remarked James Wolpert, a first-year CFA student. After a performance like that, it was hard to imagine whether Train could top it.
Train
The first song Train played was “Parachute,” a popular song off their new album, Save Me, San Francisco. After playing “Get to Me,” the band started the chords of “Drops of Jupiter,” but, much to the disappointment of the crowd, stopped after a few seconds.
Monahan laughed into the microphone and said, “I know it’s a Thursday night, but you guys aren’t ready for that yet.” Instead, the band played “Meet Virginia,” a hit single off their debut album, Train.
During the bridge of “She’s on Fire,” Monahan said, “I don’t know if I can go on. I’m exhausted. I need a couple of girls to help me.” When a few girls from the front rows were picked to go on stage, they were given shirts to put on that said “Trainettes” on them. They were then taught to sing the part “she’s on fire,” and Monahan encouraged the crowd to sing along.
For “When I Look to the Sky,” Monahan announced that he was going to sing the song “without a microphone standing between me and you,” and the crowd went dead silent as he stood on the edge of the stage and sang, projecting out to the crowd using only his raw voice.
“I don’t have a Superman shirt, but I do have a Super Train shirt,” Monahan said, pulling on a Super Train shirt before singing “Save the Day.” He also pulled up a girl in the front row who was wearing a similar shirt, which she bought from the merchandise table. Monahan improvised a song where he sang about how they were wearing the same shirt.
He ended the set with the recent hit single “Hey Soul Sister.” As the lights dimmed and the band walked off the stage, the audience continued cheering and clapping, shouting for an encore. The band soon came back and finished the night with two songs: “Drops of Jupiter” and a cover of “Dance the Night Away.”
Perhaps the most memorable part of the night was when Monahan shared a story that he learned from what he called “my therapist, mainly because I paid her a lot of money to talk to me.” Monahan described how during his world tour he felt frustrated because he wasn’t happy and he wondered what he needed. When he asked his therapist, she replied, “you’re made of two people: the traitor that says you’re not beautiful or worthy, and the angel that tells you that you are beautiful and deserving.” Maybe it’s time to start listening to that angel.

From March 25 until April 4, the Carnegie Mellon Humanities Center and the Pittsburgh Foundation are sponsoring the “Faces of Globalization” International Film Festival in conjunction with the Humanities Center theme of “Global Connections, Global Responsibilities.” Various lectures and the festival itself will work to define globalization. One of the lectures actually took place the day before the opening of the film festival; Maha Abdel-Rahman spoke about NGOs and the debate over the success of their efforts. This is the fourth year that Carnegie Mellon has helped to make the film festival a reality. Past topics have included “Faces of Democracy,” “Faces of Mechanization,” and “Faces of Realism.”
The director of the event, Jolanta Lion, expects the films he features in the festival to meet certain guidelines. “I search for recent film productions with artistic merit that bring to light dimensions of the festival topic,” Lion said. Features in the event are usually ones that have not been released to the public and would have never been shown in Pittsburgh if not for the festival. The 16 events range from documentaries to feature-length films that contain messages on issues such as global war and climate change. The first film, The Age of Stupid, premiered on Thursday, March 25 at the Pittsburgh Filmmakers Melwood Screening Room at 7:15 p.m.
Since the festival draws attention to work in multiple fields and disciplines, several Carnegie Mellon professors will be speaking at the documentaries, including CIT professor Cliff Davidson of the civil and environmental engineering department and professor Roger Rouse of the history department. At the premiere of the festival, Davidson hosted a question-and-answer session focusing on the climate change of 2055 and the eventual end of all mankind. 
Rouse is moderating a film entitled The Wondrous World of Laundry, which centers on the lives of Polish workers on the German border and their struggle to maintain their families in the midst of job uncertainty. Through dialogues with three Polish women, the documentary tries to answer the question stated by Rouse: “What happens to family life when people are increasingly pushed and pulled by transnational flows of capital and labor?”
This festival is intended to provoke thought and inspire action, as well as provide a source of entertainment for campus. Students, faculty, and the general public are encouraged to attend the film festival, especially since several of the documentaries are being shown on campus. Students are able to view all of the films, which are inspiring and emotionally engaging, for free. Students can experience new perceptions of globalization while experiencing much-needed relaxation during the second half of the spring semester.

It’s a Monday night, and most Carnegie Mellon students have done their homework and have absolutely nothing to do. The laundry is done, the rooms are cleaned, and the meals cooked, but time simply won’t fly. One could watch TV, but with so many TV shows out, we just don’t know which ones are worth watching and which ones are not. Well, worry not; here is your ideal spring TV show guide. Below is a list of some of the most popular series going on right now, my personal favorites and definitely some to watch out for. Statutory warning: Some of these TV shows are extremely addictive; ready for all-nighters? 
24
After eight seasons, people would assume that a show would lose its charm or become boring and prolonged, but 24 proves otherwise. Each season of this show has 24 action-packed episodes, each an hour long. My personal favorite character from this popular series is Jack Bauer. Throughout the series, he is constantly put in positions that require re-examination of a person’s fundamental beliefs about what is right and wrong. 24 is one of the most innovative, ground-breaking, intelligent, well-written, unpredictable, and suspenseful television series of its time. 
One Tree Hill
A very old, yet popular, TV series that seemed to have lost its charm is back with a seventh season. After a series of dramatic and unnecessary episodes, this TV classic has regained its spark even though its two principal characters — Peyton (Hilarie Burton) and Lucas (Chad Michael Murray) — have left the show. This season has jumped 14 months into the future, with each of the characters settled in their jobs and lives. If you have never seen the show, you have a lot of catching up to do. I personally do not recommend seasons five and six, but the first few seasons and season seven are must-watches. And for all those interested, Robert Buckley from The Lipstick Jungle is now playing an irresistible agent in the reinvented series. One Tree Hill is scheduled to resume again on April 26. 
Gossip Girl
What could better describe the show than the series’ own catch phrase: “You know you love me.” This show takes college and the New York Upper East Side drama to another level. Currently airing season four, this show has made its way to the top of many people’s lists. You have to love Blair Waldorf and her ways and the way Chuck Bass and she complement one another. Even though it might be difficult for many to relate to this level of drama, you can’t help but be addicted to the show. Gossip Girl allows you to look into the lives of the “Queen Bee,” the young girl trying to make her way to the top of the social ladder, the cute boy next door, the player, and the lost party girl finding her way in life. 
Modern Family
A hilarious show capturing the experiences of being a parent, no matter how chaotic and impossible and highly embarrassing it may be, Modern Family makes you laugh until you’re almost in tears. Still on its first season, this show is about the stories of three families. The first family is made up of an extremely old man and his gorgeous young wife. The second is that of his son and the son’s gay husband, and the third family is the old man’s daughter’s family. The show is a pleasant relief from all the drama and suspense of college life. 
Of course, there are several other great TV shows currently going on. Did you think that you weren’t getting enough of Greek community drama at Carnegie Mellon and you wanted more? Then the TV show Greek seems like the show for you. Other shows that are worth watching include* Jersey Shore*, an extremely hilarious TV show, How I met Your Mother, 90210, American Idol, Chuck, Lost, and Community. Also, make sure to watch out for this year’s 100 Questions and The Deep End.

Just a few weeks ago we became friends, and then she exploded. Exploded, like lava and ash forming mountains where mountains once were not. That is Iceland.
Last May, my traveling companion Amy and I journeyed from our homes to Boston, and then across the Atlantic to Iceland. We landed at Keflavík Flugvöller, took a bus to Reykjavík, rented a Ford Explorer, and began our Icelandic road trip. Our goal was to drive the perimeter of the island, covering nearly all 832 miles of the Ring Road, Route 1.
Why an Icelandic road trip, you might ask? Well, that is our travel pattern. Pick a country, explore it in full. Staying solely in Reykjavík surely would have been nice, but scouting the countryside allowed us to see Icelandic cities with populations in the low thousands, reindeer grazing in valleys, sulfur bubbling from the ground because of geothermal activity right below the surface, and the clearest blue ice floating out to sea.
We traveled on our own, reading guidebooks before we went crossing the country at our own whim. We would pull off to the side of the road at any opportunity, for a photograph or just to take a walk and enjoy the early summer sun melting piles of snow up at the 66th degree of latitude. On our third night around the island, we camped at the base of a waterfall; that afternoon, we climbed glaciers.
We drove through the most dynamic landscape we had ever seen. Streams of water from the melting snow and ice crisscrossed the countryside and created waterfalls of all sizes off nearby crevasses. Between the fire underground and the ice crossing over it, what you see one year in Iceland is rescuplted by the next.
Iceland, just recently, solicited my friendship as part of the country’s new marketing campaign, presumably to increase tourism, icelandwantstobeyourfriend.com. Just as it began, it was met with a type of fireworks as Eyjafjallajökull erupted, a volcano atop a glacier which has now been erupting for eight days and has created a new nameless mountain — a mountain that didn’t exist when we were there just under a year ago.
Having canvassed the landscape and driven the oft-formidable Ring Road with its too-frequent one-lane bridges (that is one lane total for people driving in both directions; the warning signs read “Einbreid Brú,” and you learn what that means very quickly) we returned to Reykjavík. We walked the city, ate the food, shopped the galleries, and took part in a club scene that begins after midnight, lasts through the two hours of darkness, and really gets going at 4 a.m., as the sun begins to rise back into the sky. 
We stayed at the Blue Lagoon Spa and Resort, geothermally heated by a nearby lava formation; were entertained by an Icelandic metal band (the guitarist was shirtless save for blinking white Christmas lights wrapped around his chest) at Kaffi Hljómalind; and had drinks at Kaffibarinn — all reduced in price due to the recent economic troubles in Iceland.
We enjoyed Iceland and are already quite ready to return. For now, we have to be satisfied with watching videos on the Internet of lava thrust from the ground and sassy updates from the marketers of Iceland as we wait for our next trip to that constantly changing island.

Dear Hoskins Brothers,
The love of my life has fallen for another cape girl. Do you have any advice on the newest Carnegie Mellon fashions that will garner his attention?
Sincerely,
Not-So-Super Girl
Dear Super,
Don’t worry girl, I’ll hook you up. Keep in mind, with the weather turning to spring you’re going to need something lighter than a cape. My recommendation: your recreational World of Warcraft Valorous Kirin’tor Garb. This 10-man equivalent to the Tier 8 Mage’s set will keep more than 10 men chasing after you — but with its +305 stamina you’ll keep them running for a long time. Its form-fitting curves will show off all your assets, and its glowing shoulder pads are the accessory of the year.
Now I know this armor may be a little expensive — the only way to buy one is with Tokens of the Wayward Vanisher — I don’t have the time to get into how to get those sick puppies, but you need to ask yourself: Is your man worth it? If you’re asking me, which you are, any man who turns his head and goes running at the sign of another cape is not the man you deserve. You need a man who’ll stick by you through the toughest raids and longest quests.
Randy raiding,
—Patrick Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
What’s your stance on men paying for dinner when out with a girl on campus. Do we each use a block? Do I put my meal on a block and hers on DineX?
Sincerely,
Blocked Out
Dear Blocked,
Is this a serious question? Why on earth are you taking a girl for a date on campus? If you’re going out to dinner, you go off campus and you pay. Simple. The only time you should eat on campus is for a lunch date . You each pay for your own, unless she’s off the meal plan, then you offer to cover her. You have guest blocks for a reason.
Of the restaurants on campus, which is the best for a lunch date? Ginger’s — sorry, “The Exchange.” You have enough time waiting in line together to strike up a conversation, but not long enough for the conversation to get really awkward. Imagine trying to keep your cool when you’re waiting for something from the Carnegie Mellon Café — you’ll spend an hour together before you even get your food. Ginger’s has delicious food and plenty of vegetarian options.
Note: This column is not sponsored by Ginger’s, but we would like to be. All payment in the form of sandwiches.
Take her off campus,
—Brian Hoskins

It Might Get Loud
Thursday, April 1
8 10 12
Well-known guitarists Jimmy Page, The Edge, and Jack White are the focus of this documentary about the history of the electric guitar. The movie tracks the development of the unique styles of each of these three men, from how they initially learned to play to how their distinctive sounds paved their way to success. The film concludes with a meeting of the three rockers. It Might Get Loud is an entertaining look for those who want a detailed insight into the minds of some of the greatest guitarists of today.
The Princess and the Frog
Friday, April 2
6 8 10 12
The Princess and the Frog was nominated for three Academy Awards. But perhaps most importantly, the movie’s lead character Tiana is Disney’s first black animated princess. The story itself is a classic: Through a series of crazy happenings, a prince is turned into a frog, and our heroine meets the same fate after being mistaken for a princess by the prince. The two decide to team up to fix their dilemma and face much hilarity and shenanigans along the way. The film is widely viewed as a commercial as well as a critical success, having made $300 million worldwide.
No Instruments Aloud
Saturday April 3

The Carnegie Mellon Originals are an all-male a cappella group that have been performing around campus since the beginning of 1996. This Saturday, the a cappella group will convene to present the annual concert No Instruments Aloud in McConomy Auditorium. Last year, the group performed several songs including “Grazing in the Grass,” “Lost in Canada,” “Hanging by a Moment,” and “Paralyzer.” Also performing at the event is Carnegie Mellon’s coed a cappella group Soundbytes.

A world where everyone’s a vampire — sounds like the dream of every Twilight fan? Only, in this world, everyone is a “bad” vampire and they have imprisoned the remaining humans to farm them for their tasty, nutritious blood. That’s the premise of Daybreakers, a 2010 sci-fi thriller starring the actors of Jurassic Park. The film’s distinctive look and story have earned it decent reviews among critics and moviegoers alike. Fun fact: To make it look like the world was overrun with vampires, the makers of the movie hosted a contest where ordinary people could submit images of such a world online.

Dancing is legal in all 50 states, but you would never know it from going to a Carnegie Mellon concert. Last Tuesday, the 8-Bit Alliance Tour rocked Rangos, but there was no fever pitch. As New York’s Anamanaguchi played the last act of their month-long U.S. tour, I couldn’t help but notice that our crowd was stiff and our emotions dissonant.
With no kick from the crowd, Anamanguchi was surprisingly upbeat. I wondered what it would be like to follow these guys with a camera on a concert tour.
I’ve always found rock documentaries a little funny because, while you follow the band through their trials and tribulations, you also follow their audience. A good audience is what butters a musician’s bread. Audiences should learn how to give their performers a good show because concerts aren’t cheap, and it’s hard to get what you pay for. Concert documentaries have to be the best way to learn to dance and feel comfortable looking like an idiot.
The Rolling Stones have documentaries like Shine a Light and Gimme Shelter. They are the head-banging concert documentaries that, when made by such famous directors as Martin Scorsese and the Maysles brothers, have inspired the rest. The Maysleses revealed a harrowing image in 1970 with Gimme Shelter. I personally prefer the documentary A Skin a Night that followed the band The National. Under Great White Northern Lights, the documentary about The White Stripes, was screened on campus just last week.
Concerts have the potential to become amazing experiences, but I wonder if people don’t see them that way. I remember watching The National’s concert documentary and thinking I would give anything to be at that show. Maybe that was when I stopped standing at concerts and started dancing.
Why doesn’t Carnegie Mellon have more dancing at concerts? I don’t know. I just hope we do our part and get a great concert someday. Besides, if no one else is dancing, I just look like an idiot.

This week, you will conquer the ancient gods of the Egyptian religion. Ra is not very good at housework, so assign him to be your gardener.
You must accept the truth: You wouldn't make it as a semi-professional arachnid tamer, no matter how many barrels of spider pheromones you purchase.
You will perfect the formula for granting additional superhuman abilities to persons who already have them.
Weeping will get you nowhere. Your beach house has been completely ruined by an aardvark infestation.
Your roommate next year will have an unidentifiable ethnicity. This is because you are not sure where Treants hail from, but you would feel awkward asking.
The exchange program you are considering seems ideal, but in reality it is a slave labor camp set up by the remnants of the USSR. Avoid it unless you enjoy breaking rocks and digging holes.
The stars can't give away specifics, but be careful around staples, "Walking to the Sky," and oversized 10-gallon hats this coming week.
You may be pretty awesome, but you aren't the best. Remember, you don't own a porcupine like Bethany Fox of Buffalo, N.Y. does.
You will spend the rest of your life developing a more effective method for creating and organizing colonies of microbes. However, your enigmatic rival will beat you to every discovery.
Buy a trailer home, cultivate a beer gut, and get a tramp stamp of the Confederate flag; your new stepparent is quite a redneck and you will need those to blend in with your new family.
Attempt to set a new record for sleep deprivation. Approximately 33 days should be sufficient to break the record.

Candidates for student body president and vice president elaborate on their platforms at the elections debate. Watch the complete video on cmuTV's website, youtube page.
The candidates for student body president and vice president elaborated on their platforms at a debate held by The Tartan and the Elections Board yesterday. Each pair of candidates had a different take on how to shape student government in the upcoming year. Jarrett Adams, a junior information systems major, and Kate Smith, a junior social and decision science major, described their platform's focus as improving the student experience. Michael Surh and Micah Rosa, both junior business majors, targeted adapting the student body to the effects of the economic recession. Casey Brander, a junior art major — whose running mate Matt Sandler, a junior BCSA major, wasn't present but participated through a video introduction — stressed how she would tap into her creative experiences to impact student government. 
Voting opens this Saturday and runs until Tuesday, April 6.

This year’s student government elections, scheduled to begin Saturday, include a large pool of candidates for all three positions (student body president and vice president, student body vice president for finance, and student body vice president of organizations), all of whom have their own ideas to enhance the Carnegie Mellon student experience. 
The Tartan sat down with the candidates this past week to get to know them and what motivates their campaigns for the 2010 student government elections.
Shanel Buchanan and Eric Wu compete for student votes
Shanel Buchanan, junior biology and psychology major, hopes to address the issues of transparency within the Joint Funding Committee (JFC).
“My campaign offers a fresh perspective based on old values,” Buchanan said.
Buchanan feels that the image of the JFC is in need of change, as many in the student body are uninformed about how the JFC functions in the context of Student Government as a whole. She wants students to understand the process and to see that they have a large part in what the JFC does. She sees this as coming hand-in-hand with better partnerships with the Committee on Student Organizations, Undergraduate Student Senate, and the Graduate Student Assembly. 
In addition to currently serving on the JFC, Buchanan’s involvement on campus through organizations such as National Society of Black Engineers, Women’s Leadership Institute, and Emergency Medical Services has allowed her to see the organizational side of the process.
“JFC should not be thought of as just cutting budgets, but more like making helpful suggestions,” Buchanan said of the the JFC’s image among student groups.
In terms of consistency, Buchanan wants to show that the JFC can be consistent with each organization every year. She saw inconsistencies within the JFC’s yearly funding when she served as treasurer of a student organization for the past two years. 
Buchanan also wants to hold organizations more fiscally accountable for their budgets.
Buchanan mentioned additional ideas, such as continuing where current Student Body Vice president for finance Nara Kasbergen left off in terms of improving the JFC relationship with student organizations and expanding the role of the representative to serve as a mentor who can help with queries, such as how to contact AB Tech about showing a movie. Buchanan hopes that all of these initiatives will also aid in improving the visibility of the JFC throughout campus.
Eric Wu may be the first computer science major to run for a position in the student government executive branch in recent years. 
His plans are centered on expanding the role of SBVPF beyond the JFC, helping the elected student to become a campus educator for students on the financial situation of the university, as well as promoting careful spending for student organizations.
“Everyone just associates VPF with JFC,” Wu said. “But there’s so much more to it.”
Wu hopes to plan fall meetings of the JFC at which the members look not just at student organization budgets but at other financial issues faced by the university. 
Wu mentioned issues such as finding ways to communicate the university’s economic situation to students, as well as assisting with his proposed Economies of Scale initiative. Economies of Scale would promote, for example, the purchase of a projector that could be rented out to organizations at a nominal fee less than the current $100 necessary for renting university projectors. The initiative could also include things such as mass purchases of wood for organizations during Carnival.
Wu also aims to work with David Ruvolo and the Office of Student Activities to better train the JFC representatives. He spoke highly of what Kasbergen has already done in diversifying the JFC, as this familiarizes the JFC with more of the organizations.
Wu has been heavily involved on campus and cited his experiences as one of his major qualifications. In Student Senate, he served as chair of the Internal Development Committee and was heavily involved in the Healthy Campus 2010 designated smoking area plan. He also has worked with Housing and Dining in changing vendors to Parkhurst and with other programmers in developing CMU Portal at cmuevent.org. Wu has worked with other student-based organizations such as Awareness of Roots in Chinese Culture, and he has  also served as a first-year mentor in Mudge House.
“I’ve always been interested in finance,” Wu said, “and I really want to help further my peers and the university.”
Aaron Gross runs to become first SBVPO
Aaron Gross, a junior information systems and policy and management major, is the only candidate to run for this newly added student government executive position. Gross has a long history of student organization leadership including time as an Orientation counselor and the president of Scotch’n’Soda. He is also the current chair of the Undergraduate Student Senate.
“I want to be an advocate for helping organizations do the best work they can do,” Gross said. “And I want to make sure that they are appreciated.”
Gross’s Media Screens initiative proposes the addition of TV screens, similar to the one in Kirr Commons in the UC, to be placed throughout campus to be used for organization advertisement and events. Gross has spoken with peer institution Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, whose open-source technology for such TVs could be adapted to Carnegie Mellon.
Beyond promoting organizations on campus, Gross wants to learn more about the current student activity experience. His Data Collecting initiative includes conducting a survey of students regarding the effectiveness of the Activities Fair and a financial analysis of current Student Activities processes such as reimbursements.
Gross’ small grant program would reward organizations that collaborate with one another and allow for combination of funding.
“The organizations are already strong. Where the VPO comes in is clearing the roadblocks,” Gross said.
Gross cited roadblocks such as reimbursement time and lack of office and rehearsal space, for which he described a solution: approaching the Board of Trustees and discussing a place in the university’s Master Plan, a plan developed by the university for approximately 20 years of campus growth, approved by the city of Pittsburgh and most recently updated in 2002.
If elected, Gross plans on meeting individually with every student organization on campus to better assess their needs, beginning as soon as this current spring semester.
Editor’s Note: Aaron Gross is a former layout manager for The Tartan.
Michael Surh and Micah Rosa, Candidates for Student Body President (SBP) and Student Body Vice President (SBVP)
For Michael Surh and Micah Rosa, both junior business majors, the key to improving the Carnegie Mellon student experience is in through its organizations, including Greek life.
“Clubs are what’s central to CMU,” Rosa said. “We just need to make sure we’re serving them as best as we can.”
The pair’s platform includes a number of initiatives, all focused on student groups. The Student Trade Employment Platform (STEM) would offer organizations as well as students a chance to make extra money while also serving the Pittsburgh community. STEM would create a digitized database in which local businesses could list odd jobs they need done, such as designing a webpage or making an advertisement.
Surh and Rosa have a history of student involvement on campus, particularly in entrepreneurship start-ups, many of which are relevant to their initiatives and which they say gives their campaign something extra, since they have experience in already implementing all that they are proposing.
Their Active Communication Program  would include a weekly column in The Tartan as well as an opt-in/opt-out e-mail newsletter to familiarize students and groups with the happenings of student government.
In order to centralize the club community, the CMU Central initiative would build off the existing CMU Portal in listing all clubs, leaders, websites, and events in one place with the ability of categorization by club type, as well as a built-in website template for any student organization to use and modify for its own purposes. They already have a limited CMU Portal up and running.
To unite Carnegie Mellon’s diverse clubs and interests, Rosa and Surh propose redirecting the existing Tartan Rewards programs to student organization events, providing rewards both for students with high attendance as well as the organizations who put on the events for the community.
“We can’t force you to be proud,” Surh said. “We want you to have every reason to be proud of this school.”
Jarrett Adams and Kate Smith, Candidates for SBP and SBVP
Jarrett Adams, a junior information systems major, and Kate Smith, a junior social and decision science major, have termed their campaign “A College To Believe In” after an Obama campaign slogan.
“What’s behind A College To Believe In is the most student-based campaign possible,” Adams said. “A lot of students have a negative view of life here. We want to change this to a positive.”
Adams and Smith have both been very involved on campus, from Adams’ role as an RA, a member of various SACs, and a Student Senator to Smith’s role as Greek life intern, leadership in Kappa Alpha Theta, involvement in 1000plus, and former membership on the varsity soccer team.
The pair has a series of initiatives aimed at enhancing the student experience, from a CollegeConnect program featuring inter-college socials and college-based lecture programs to an increase in transparency and communication achieved by meeting with student leaders from such organizations as the Student Dormitory Council and the Greek governing bodies on a regular basis.
The Campus Life and Unity initiative aims to encourage students to get involved as early as possible. The plan hopes to motivate students to get involved as soon as Orientation is over, assuming that the Orientation spirit will carry through. The pair expressed an interest in working with the Orientation staff and serving as a resource and added perspective for them.
“We want to support students in every way that we can to make their college experience the best it could possibly be,” Smith said.
Adams and Smith spoke of the importance of looking at all the aspects that shape a student’s experience. Their Executive Grant Program would investigate endeavors such as adding electrical outlets to the Cut for student laptops, while the Great Ideas campaign would encourage the development of more student ideas.
“If students feel like they can’t complain to us, we’re not doing a good job,” Adams said.
“Seriously, give us as many [problems] as possible. We want to try and fix them,” Smith added.
Editor’s Note: Jarrett Adams and Kate Smith are staffwriters for The Tartan.
Casey Brander and Matt Sandler, Candidates for SBP and SBVP
For Casey Brander, a junior art major, and Matt Sandler, a junior BCSA major, their platform is defined by their sense of humor when describing the Carnegie Mellon student experience.
The pair has a long history in collaboration on art projects, such as a winning billboard in a recent contest and a computerized remote that shocks the player during video games. 
In addition to their shared history, they have a wide range of interests that they hope to bring to the student population. 
They are passionate about getting a lot more active off campus through expanding such events as 1000plus, enforcing the designated smoking area policy, increasing dining selection, and putting added focus on sustainability.
While doing their signature Z-snap move, the two spoke about their get-it-done personalities.
“We’re all about creative solutions,” Brander said.
The two have been involved in a variety of campus organizations. Brander is passionate about her artwork while pursuing multiple outside projects, and was responsible for bringing Reverend Billy to campus as an AB speaker. 
Sandler is currently the AB Comedy chair, is the former Comics editor at The Tartan, and has a great interest in robotics.
The two engaged in banter about the patriarchal labeling of history, the importance of robotics, and the main slogan for their campaign, while showing their complementary and similarly light-hearted personalities.
Editor’s Note: Matt Sandler is a former Comics editor for The Tartan.

“I really want to make JFC something people are proud to be on,” Robert Piston said as he withdrew his candidacy for student body vice president for finance.
After deliberation, Piston decided to withdraw his candidacy because he believed “someone who can put a lot of time into the position” deserves it, and since he had been recently accepted into the CIT Honors Research program, he wasn’t sure if he had the flexibility anymore. “I received the letter that I was a candidate for honors research after I submitted my SBVPF petition. I have been very carefully considering this decision,” he said.
“CMU is such a great research institution. It is so highly reputable, and so revered for its research. And just the fact that they allow undergraduates to participate in this is a unique opportunity,” Piston said. With Piston considering graduate school, he felt this research would “be an important step,” and he would not continue in the election.
Piston stressed that, although he has withdrawn his candidancy, he still deeply cares about the JFC and hopes that it can continue to refine its internal processes, much like Undergraduate Student Senate did this year. He spoke directly about junior information systems and policy and management major Aaron Gross’ leadership as Senate chair, applauding his use of quantitative analysis: “He analyzed what was going well, and not, through simple things: Google forms, questionnaires, compiling data, and figuring out people’s expectations,” Piston said, emphasizing that this was something he would “really like to see happen with JFC, and student organizations and their treasurers.”
And while Piston said, “I firmly believe both are very qualified candidates,” he is now endorsing Eric Wu for SBVPF. According to Piston, “[Wu] is very dedicated to his work … and I feel confident that his experience ... would serve him the best.”

A student-wide referendum regarding the potential payment of a yearly stipend to Carnegie Mellon’s student government executives is on the ballot next week, appearing as a secondary issue in this year’s upcoming student government elections.
Senior political science and international relations major Rotimi Abimbola, who currently serves as student body president, is putting forth the referendum. “I’m either in class or at a meeting, which is what your schedule is like as president. When you do have free time, people always ping you and ask you to come to meetings or make decisions … so the to-do list is really just endless,” Abimbola said. 
“After a lot of hard work and investing a lot of time and effort into the position … I began to realize that I needed some type of income.”
“Both Timi and I pay for our own living expenses, and we had jobs prior to this year. Timi was an RA, and I worked 10 to 15 hours a week for the civil engineering department,” said senior communications design major and Student Body Vice President of Finance Nara Kasbergen. “Timi no longer has a job, and I’ve kept my job with civil engineering, but only because I schedule my own hours.… Not to sound melodramatic, but we’ve both really struggled to make ends meet this year. We’ve been willing to make the sacrifice because we feel like the students and our initiatives are worth it, but really, no one should be going hungry or struggling to get by because they want to do a service to the student body.
“I guess I wouldn’t really call it compensation as much as a living wage.”
Executives stress that it is important to note that none of the current student government executives, including Abimbola and Kasbergen, would financially benefit from the proposed stipends. Stipends would be paid out at the earliest in fall 2010 to the new student body president and vice presidents. 
“It would be a disservice to the student body if the right candidate for a position decided they were unable to run because they just couldn’t afford not to have a part-time job on the side, and the many hours required by holding such a position make it impossible to have a job,” Kasbergen said.
Currently, the student government is considering using either an outside donor or the student activities fee to fund stipends, and there are strong arguments on both sides. Many Carnegie Mellon students have expressed a strong reaction to learning that they would be in part paying one of their peer’s living expenses, but that type of awareness is actually a part of what some are hoping to achieve with stipends.
“In the past, many in the student body have felt that student government is just a bunch of people who love titles and don’t do anything,” Abimbola said. “Most of the Senators [in Undergraduate Student Senate] thought stipends should come out of the student activities fee so there is some sense of accountability to your constituents.”
Junior general humanities and social sciences major Jarrett Adams is one of the Senators who believes in drawing stipends from the student activities fee, even as he enters the race for student body president. “I believe that student government executives, if given a stipend, should be given one through the student activities fee because then it holds them accountable to the student body, not to the administration,” he said. “To be paid out of an alumni endowment that is only vaguely related to student government could be a conflict of interest for student body representatives and their relationship with both the administration and the interests of alumni. Students should be able to hold their representatives accountable, and executive pay needs to ensure that happens.”
However, there are also many who believe that an outside donor should pay the stipends, despite the loss of accountability. “While it makes good sense that our constituents should support us, I believe that, if possible, we should be paid through funding from an outside donor,” said sophomore business administration major Eric Wu, who is running for student body vice president of finance. “Given the nature of our university, very few of our constituents understand the time and dedication required to excel in such a position.”
Besides worries about backlash from the student body, there are also many financial concerns about whether the student activities fee provides enough money to support stipends. “The Joint Funding Committee already has a hard time cutting down budgets with the pool that is allocated to us from the student activities fee,” Wu said.
“Everyone wants to be careful about how we are allotting our money and whether or not this is the right timing for [us] to start spending more in the middle of an economic downtown,” said junior business administration major Michael Surh, who is also running for student body president. “Carnegie Mellon is an awesome school, and there are a lot of programs here that could use extra funding. We need to make sure that every single student here gets the full experience, because that is what student government is here to do.”
“We’re facing crunches in departments, we’re facing crunches in funding, and we want to make sure that the student activities fee money goes more towards the school as whole than to the student government that is running it,” echoed junior business administration major Micah Rosa, who is running for student body vice president with Surh. “As of now, there are more responsible ways to use the limited funds we have.”
On the other hand, paying stipends through a donor also has its advantages. “If it came from a donor, it would be an endowed position, so we would not have to worry about the donor stopping funds five years from now,” explained Abimbola.
However, to many, holding a position within student government is considered worthwhile without pay. “We should be content with our positions and with the satisfaction we get from our positions. We get power, we get influence, we get respect, and we get a strong résumé builder,” Rosa said.
Some in student government, including junior art major Casey Brander, who is running for student body president with junior BCSA major Matt Sandler, see the referendum as a simple economic transaction. “My answer to all questions is: Get money, get paid.”
But for now, Abimbola and the rest of the student government executives and Undergraduate Student Senate are waiting to see how students vote on the referendum in the coming election. “I personally would not feel comfortable putting forth this type of legislation without first tapping into student opinion,” Surh said.

1000plus, an annual Carnegie Mellon day of community service, brought together over 1000 students to spend last Saturday engaged in service activities across Pittsburgh. 1000 Plus is in its third year of operation and for the past two has partnered with Pittsburgh Cares, a local nonprofit aimed at increasing community volunteerism.
Throughout the day, groups of students were shuttled to locations across the city where they participated in a variety of service activities, including adult education and literacy, disaster relief, homelessness and hunger eradication, and environmental protection and preservation. Students unable to dedicate the necessary four hours for the off-campus on-site projects were able to assist with in-house projects. These included making senior Jeopardy games and literacy bingo for schools.
Jonathan Kroll, the former coordinator of Student Development, began the service day in the spring of 2008. 1000plus is currently run by a student board and has been sponsored by the coordinator of Student Development, Lucas Christian, for the past two years.
While the event’s title stems from the aim of organizing over 1000 volunteers, just under 600 students registered in 2008. This year is the first to boast a registration over 1000.
Christian accredited this to the student-organized branding effort in 2009, which included the current website and the now-familiar silhouettes positioned across campus. The same year, they chose to partner with Pittsburgh Cares.
Pittsburgh Cares coordinated the on-site and in-house projects, drawing on a network of over 350 regional nonprofits. They offer year-round opportunities for students and community members to become involved in one-time or ongoing volunteering projects.
Alexa New, the Pittsburgh Cares program manager for Business Cares and Campus Cares, has worked with 1000plus for the entirety of the partnership. She also works with other Carnegie Mellon service organizations throughout the year. “CMU students are really unique. They are the best student leaders. They get their peers involved and really take ownership of the projects.”
Thom Dawkins, a Pittsburgh Cares volunteer, agreed with New’s assessment. “I’ve never seen a university where students are so proactive.”
Cindy Wang, a sophomore business administration major and member of the student board, also discussed the unique aspects of 1000plus among service events. “It reaches across campus and involves everyone at CMU: students, alumni, staff, as well as members of the Pittsburgh community.”
Christian articulated a desire for an even greater scope. “The hope is that 1000plus can be more than just one day of service, that it can be a group of students organizing service all year round.” To this end, 1000plus created posters staked across the Cut for MLK Day, a national day of service, with statistics about the amount of service completed by students.
1000plus also partnered with student organizations across campus, and Christian cited the Greek organizations as being especially involved. Kate Smith, a junior social and decision science major and 1000plus student board member, is a member of Kappa Alpha Theta and credits the service hours required by Greek life as a reason for pledging.
This year alone, Carnegie Mellon students, faculty, and staff volunteered around 117,500 hours. During 1000plus, over 4000 hours were volunteered, representing an contribution to Pittsburgh of about $80,000 worth of work hours.
Christian summed up this effort, explaining that “the culture of service is already here on campus.... I think it is really cool that even with a very academically rigorous curriculum, students still find time for what they’re passionate about, and one of those things is service. We want to help foster that.”

Carnegie Mellon’s SafeWalk is an independent, student-run organization that offers escorts to students, faculty, and staff walking through campus during late-night hours. The organization’s mission states that the group hopes to “minimize exposure of the Carnegie Mellon community to crime risks, to deter criminals, and to promote an enhanced feeling of personal safety.”
Any students traveling late at night can request an escort at any time from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. Students can contact SafeWalk by calling the organization’s dispatcher at (412) 268-SAFE, or by approaching any member of the escort team that is not responding to a call. SafeWalk will escort students between on-campus locations or throughout Oakland, including Webster Hall, Fairfax Apartments, Cathedral Mansions, London Terrace, Shirley Apartments, Shady Oak Apartments, and Veronica Apartments.
Current SafeWalk president and junior engineering and public policy and mechanical engineering major Ben Streeter became involved in SafeWalk during his first year at Carnegie Mellon, quickly joining the executive board with the hope of continuing to increase SafeWalk’s visibility among students.
“I became involved with the executive board after only three or four shifts because I was reading through the organization’s manual and saw a few things that could have used a little improvement,” Streeter said. 
Since Streeter joined the executive board almost three years ago, SafeWalk’s service has seen a definite growth in usage. “When I first joined the program, the service wasn’t used very much. I think we got around 12 calls a semester. It is steadily growing — with each semester we get more and more requests for escorts,” Streeter said. “Today we are up to a call volume of two or three calls a week. But, then again, one night last semester I received three calls in one night, so it is definitely continuing to grow.”
Ashish Babaria, a junior mathematical sciences major who is now on the SafeWalk executive board, became involved with SafeWalk after hearing about the group’s mission. “I feel as if safety is one of those things which is often overlooked by students during the late hours of the night.... I wanted to spread the word about SafeWalk, so that students realize how important their safety is.”
In addition to offering students a number to call when they are in need of an escort, SafeWalk also gives many students a unique option for providing a public service to the Carnegie Mellon community. 
While SafeWalk has always accepted student volunteers and now boasts a membership of over 50 individual volunteers, the organization recently created an “Adopt-a-Day” program that allows student groups to become involved as well. Adopt-a-Day allows student organizations the opportunity to sign up to provide volunteers during SafeWalk’s 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. shift one day each week. Currently four student organizations have adopted days to help out with SafeWalk’s evening shifts, including three fraternities.
Stephanie Kao, a sophomore mathematical sciences major and a third SafeWalk executive board member, stressed the necessity of such an organization on campus and simultaneously the need for a strong group of volunteers.
“In a couple months, we had more calls than we had all last year. So this really prompts us to ensure that SafeWalk is a reliable option for people when they are considering their safety on campus,” Kao said.
Any student interested in volunteering with SafeWalk, or any student organization wishing to adopt a day, should visit SafeWalk’s webpage at www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/safewalk.

Creativity in the Arts and Sciences: Contrasts in Disposition, Development, and Achievement
Thursday, April 1 
at 4:30 p.m.
Gregg Hall (Porter Hall 100)
Dean Keith Simonton, a distinguished professor in the department of psychology at the University of California, Davis, talks about whether or not creativity is a one-size-fits-all characteristic. 
Psychologists have often thought of creativity as a single entity, where some people are creative and others, by a matter or disposition, are just not.
In first examining this lack of clarity, it needs to be realized that the creativity of artists is different from the the creativity of scientists, and then various disciplines under these categories also vary in interpretation of creativity. Psychologists also look at variations in people’s traits to determine what’s needed to display our creativity.

Playground explores theater
For one week each school year, student directors, designers, actors, technicians, and playwrights in the School of Drama collaborate on more than 40 student-run productions to produce Playground: A Festival of Independent Student Work. 
The festival, which completed its seventh year this past week, offers student actors and producers the opportunity to create their own productions outside of normal classroom requirements and guidelines. One week’s worth of rehearsals and preparations culminated in performances and events staged throughout campus.
The events varied across disciplines represented within the School of Drama. They included dramatic and musical performances, installations, mural projects, and light shows.
Student productions include performances of One Thousand Paper Cranes, The Obsolete Man, PigPen presents: “The Nightmare Story,” and Parting Shots from the Musical Theatre Canon.
Projects developed by students for Playground have gone on to be produced in other venues across the country, including New York, Los Angeles, and at various theater festivals.
For more information, including a video trailer of the week’s events, please visit http://www.cmu.edu/cfa/drama/events/playground/framed.html.
Robot named most durable
One of Carnegie Mellon’s newest technologies — a robot called “Dragon Runner” — has been named the world’s most durable robot, according to the collaborators creating the 2010 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records. 
Dragon Runner is a small robot that can be used for surveillance in urban areas. The rugged robot has four wheels and is 15 inches long, less than a foot wide, and five inches in height. At only nine pounds, it is light enough to be carried in a backpack or thrown. It is also able to be powered by military batteries, making it ideal for areas with little to no electricity.
Dragon Runner is being tested in Iraq, acting as the “eyes” for U.S. Marines, as it can see around corners and deliver real-time imagery.
Dragon Runner was developed by Hagen Schempf, head systems scientist at Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute. Twelve early examples of Dragon Runner, built by Carnegie Mellon spin-off Automatika Inc., were delivered to the Marines in 2004. Today, several models of Dragon Runner are now produced commercially by QinetiQ .

If you haven’t been living under a rock (or in a cluster), you probably know by now that the U.S. House of Representatives passed a comprehensive health care reform bill late Sunday, March 22. You also probably know that Republicans are unhappy with the bill. 
Though there are strong views and valid points on both sides of the debate, it is actions outside the political arena that concern us most. In the week since the passage of the bill, several Congressmen have received threats and had their offices vandalized as a result of their votes. These petty acts of violence violate the core principles of our republic.
The past few years have seen a disturbing polarization of the American political establishment as the Republicans and Democrats move farther apart. As the parties have appealed to their bases, the radical factions of each side gain influence. Yet this polarization does not excuse threats of violence against elected officials. This is not a country with autocratic rule, where there exists no lawful way to change the government. It is not a totalitarian state where violent protest is the only way to make one’s voice heard. We are in a midterm election year, and those who have grievances with the current leadership should take their anger and join political groups or run for office.
Though Democrats would like to paint the entire Republican Party as supporting these domestic terrorists, this is a willful misconception. People who believe that threatening the families of Congressmen is a valid political statement are not part of our political process. They have probably not read any part of the actual health care bill, nor have they likely educated themselves about both sides of the debate. Doing so would have required knowledge of the principles of American government, something these terrorists obviously lack. Instead of relying on facts, these individuals know only what they have heard from sources like Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh.
The trend of radicalization and extremism in American politics over the last decade has grave risks for our future as a democracy. In a nation of laws, there should never be justification for threats and violence against government officials. Rather than participating in democracy, those who commit these acts attack its very foundations.

Endorsements are tricky.
We at The Tartan have read the candidates’ platforms, interviewed each of them, hosted the debates, and worked with many of the candidates within our own organization and through covering student government over the past year. An endorsement of a candidate compiles all of this knowledge and provides an additional, or possibly the only, reason for a student to vote for a candidate.
We have already described in recent issues the lack of general student body interest in student government and the vacancies in Undergraduate Student Senate this year, and we attempted early in the election season to convince you that student government is in fact important and worth paying attention to. Whether or not we have succeeded in these goals, we will now explain our own evaluation of the candidates and the reasons for the following endorsements.
You might cynically say: Well, of course we should endorse Gross; he is the only candidate running for this position. We would not endorse him if we were not confident that he deserved our votes. Gross has been an active member of a number of clubs and organizations on campus, as well as an excellent leader for Undergraduate Student Senate. He is thorough, meticulous, and organized, and he has a strong and compelling vision for the role of the VPO. Moreover, he is extremely personable and will be easily approachable for all of the varied student organizations that will benefit from his direction next year. All of these things are evidenced in his long and detailed platform. While we likely believe that setting forth 14 different platform initiatives — many of which are large and complex projects in their own right — presents a challenge for a candidate to live up to, if anyone can accomplish most of these projects, it is certainly Gross. We have complete faith that he is the perfect person to define the future for organizations at Carnegie Mellon.
With Robert Piston withdrawing from the race, we are left with two remaining VPF candidates to select from: Shanel Buchanan and Eric Wu. While Buchanan and Wu have both served on the Joint Funding Committee, a major component of the role of the VPF, their other work differentiates them. Buchanan’s platform was nearly non-existent; her answers at the debate, while competent, were lacking vision; and she has not solidly pulled from her experience as the treasurer of other organizations. On the other hand, Wu’s experience with Student Senate as well as his clear vision for continuing current VPF Nara Kasbergen’s goals of growing the JFC are well prepared, and we believe he will provide strong leadership for the JFC. We do question his plan to interview JFC reps as a part of the application process, as it is already difficult to find potential representatives. However, we are interested to see how he will work to separate the role of VPF from solely chair of the JFC to a larger student-advocacy role regarding university finances.
Finally, for the role of student body president, we have decided not to endorse a candidate. As described, we endorse candidates whom we believe deserve your votes. Unfortunately, this year we believe none of the three tickets have presented a compelling case for their candidacy. Each of the three has advantages and disadvantages, with none standing significantly above the others.
Casey Brander and Matt Sandler have provided a spectacle we have not witnessed in recent years. They are stark, honest, derisive, and pro-cyborg. While some have attacked them for mocking the process or turning democracy into performance art, they have followed every rule and made their method work within the system. They have brought a fresh perspective to the elections, but they have not shown a clear grasp of the issues or a commitment to the goals of the student body. As much as we actually would enjoy two-ply bathroom toilet paper, we don’t believe their platform or their experience is enough to back them in this election.
Michael Surh and Micah Rosa excelled in the debate. They were well spoken, able to explain their innovative platform, and showed an understanding of this campus as well as student government. However, even with new and creative ideas, we are not sure a website and employment opportunities are what we need student government to focus on over the next year. Their platform and background is different, also in a way we haven’t seen before. It is conservative, fiscally focused, and likely not what the student body is seeking.
Jarrett Adams and Kate Smith should have captured our endorsement easily. With Adams’ student government experience (the only candidate with any) and Smith’s committed involvement in Greek life, the pair seems to be the obvious choice. However, their performance at the debates was weak, their answers vague, and ideas even less clear. Reading their extensive platform is an exercise in double-speak. They want reform but give no examples; they want more lectures, more Greek involvement, more unity, and more transparency, but at no point do they explain how they will achieve any of these goals. They might have the most experience, but they have the least substance.

Recently, CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other people of software development importance at Facebook Inc. were awarded a patent for the News Feed feature. This patent, entirely based on software, is very potent and has significant implications for other social networks. It is not as general as many other patents, but it is a symptom of a larger problem in the U.S. patent system.
The system of intellectual property (IP) legislation was set in place, according to the U.S. Constitution, “to promote the progress of science and the useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.” IP legislation covers patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and copyrights. However, the current system has major flaws in the application process for patents. These flaws allow corporations to abuse the patent system to leech resources from companies — resources that would be better spent improving products.
The patent system is lax, and intentionally so. Allowing laxity in a system of IP protection permits patents that need not have practical applications or represent significant innovation on the part of the patent holder, in case usages are found for their devices during the term of their patent. Alternately, a patent can be used as a defensive mechanism, creating a sort of standoff where two companies produce products that have mutual violations, but no suit is filed.
However, there exists a type of corporation referred to as a “patent troll.” These corporations apply for, and receive, patents that allow them to sue existing successful companies. These companies produce no products, so they are not afraid of countersuits by the established corporations that they threaten. The companies are granted patents that allow them to siphon money from established corporations by exploiting weaknesses in the patent application process. This exploitation allows them to gain patents for technologies that already exist or patents that are so general that they could apply to almost any product on the market.
The weaknesses these companies exploit target the patent application process. When a patent application is submitted, it is reviewed by employees of the Patent and Trademark Office. These individuals are highly skilled in their field of study, but since they are expected to review patents from a diverse range of specialties, errors are inevitable. There is a section of the patent application, called the prior art section, that exists to give the reviewer the background information necessary to understand the patent. However, abuse patents simply omit the section entirely or overwhelm the reviewer with hundreds or thousands of references, making it impossible to fully comprehend the context for the patent. This leads to the acceptance of applications that should not be granted patents.
In addition, there is a new type of patent that is particularly vulnerable to abuse. These are software patents. Software patents are open to abuse because they very closely resemble business processes. This allows patenting organizations to patent processes, claiming they are software innovations, rather than inventions, and thereby removing the need for a physical component. 
In addition, the patenting of a software application removes specificity from the claimed invention, allowing any software application that performs the same function to violate the patent and create grounds for a lawsuit.
The outlook for an entity facing a suit for patent infringement is dire. All suits concerning patent infringement are heard in a trial before a jury. The defense has little hope of convincing a jury, consisting of persons not trained in the field, of the highly technical differences between the patent they are being sued for violating and the actual operating process of their product. To make matters worse, even if a qualified expert were to be drawn in the jury duty lottery, the prosecution could have the juror removed from the jury before the trial began. Because of this, defendants often settle out of court for large sums of money. This constant barrage of lawsuits drains the corporations of resources that could be used to create better products, and thus deprives the consumer of innovative technologies that could be highly beneficial.
The solution to this problem, however, is simple. By implementing a system of peer reviews, where subject matter experts are asked to weigh in on the suitability of a patent application, U.S. IP legislation can bring some sanity back into the process of patents. 
There are members of both the industry and academic communities that would relish the opportunity to review patents for the Patent and Trademark Office. By allowing these persons to review patents and have a word in the final decision, the integrity of the patent system is preserved without undermining the protections guaranteed by the IP legislation. This proposed system creates a much better distinction between those developments that are and are not patent-worthy and protects both truly innovative entities and those organizations that want to use well-established systems and concepts in order to improve their products.

When a group of Republican members of Congress started a slow-burn effort to smoke information out of the Department of Justice, they may not have expected that, when the pot finally boiled over, the only dish they served themselves was a helping of hypocrisy.
Senator Charles Grassley (R–Iowa) and a handful of other Republicans had been putting pressure on U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder since last fall to release the names of nine appointees in the Department of Justice who, in their previous practice, had represented or advocated on behalf of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Such conflict of interest, the group stated, raised “serious questions about who is providing advice on detainee matters.” That month, the Justice Department released the names of two of the officials.
The real firestorm ignited earlier this month, when Keep America Safe — an organization partly run by Liz Cheney, daughter of the former Vice President — posted an online video ad ominously asking, “Who are these government officials...? Why the secrecy behind the other seven? Whose values do they share?”
The response was explosive. Accusations of McCarthyism and treason were flung back and forth faster than commentators could keep track of them. And when Grassley and Cheney got their answer a day later, all the puffed-up threats of terror sympathizers in the federal government collapsed faster than a deflating souffle. A review of documents and reports carried out by Fox News revealed that most of the dreaded “al-Qaeda Seven” had “only minor or short-lived roles” in representing detainees.
Furthermore, as the same Fox News article pointed out, “the Obama administration is not the first to hire lawyers who represented or advocated for terror suspects.” President George W. Bush had at least three of them during his term, during which time none of the current conservative pot-stirrers had anything negative to say about the matter.
This flip-flopping behavior is turning into a general GOP trend. Republicans have been showing a disturbing lack of respect for the established truth — even from their own archives. During the House debate on health care reform two weeks ago, Republicans decried the Democrats’ proposed use of a “deem and pass” procedure, one employed more than 35 times during the last Republican-controlled Congress. In 2006, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani touted the American justice system for bringing terror suspect Zacarias Moussaoui into civilian court and giving him a fair trial. “We are a nation of law,” he said then. Last year, however, Giuliani derided the proposal that 9/11 planner Khalid Shaikh Mohammed could be brought to trial in New York instead of to a military tribunal, saying that it would be “an overconcern with the rights of terrorists.”
As Cheney’s scare-mongering video and Grassley’s scandal-digging quest highlight, the Republicans are increasingly a party more interested in politics than progress, or even consistent policies.

At the end of this week, student government elections will be upon us again. It’ll have been a whole year since I was in the position of the current candidates, biting my nails in nervous anticipation as students cast their votes for the 2009–10 student body vice president of finance. Since then, many things have changed, but the core questions in voters’ minds that are being addressed in the candidates’ platforms are still the same: How do you plan to make the Joint Funding Committee (JFC) more efficient? Should the activities fee be raised?
While those are certainly critical concerns, some equally important questions aren’t being asked. One of the foremost issues in my mind that I highly encourage this year’s voters to think about as they read the candidates’ platforms and cast their ballots is the following: What should the relationship be between the JFC and student organizations? How can that relationship be improved and strengthened?
This might seem like a rhetorical question, but the reality is that it addresses a key issue that has often been overlooked. For many years, the JFC has been an organization that has operated behind closed doors, about as far removed from students as the CIA is from ordinary citizens. The JFC did appoint a representative to each student group seeking funding, but they would meet once, and it would be a cursory and impersonal conversation with the representative pointing out a few things in the budget proposal that the JFC couldn’t or wouldn’t fund, and the student group including or disregarding that feedback at will. Occasionally, an organization would lay out its concerns in an impassioned plea for more funding, but more often than not, the representative would turn around the minute those doors were shut and recommend a decrease. Historically, JFC representatives have been too wrapped up in the self-important knowledge that they have a hand in the allocation of $1.2 million. They have failed to fulfill their duties as accessible advisers and advocates for the groups they were appointed to represent.
The good news is that this has been changing. But the aura of mistrust between the JFC and student organizations still persists. Groups still purposely inflate their budgets in anticipation that everything will get cut anyway, and in return, the committee finds that it can’t trust organizations to be honest about their needs. And that’s what this is all about: building relationships grounded in trust. It is my firm belief that we can do audits, we can raise the activities fee, we can even redo BudgetTracker, but the JFC process will never be efficient or effective while there is no trust and no partnership between the committee and student organizations.
This year, I pioneered a new initiative in the JFC, where committee members were assigned to organizations in October and encouraged to meet with their groups during the first semester to get to know them and attend their events, forming a foundation of understanding and trust before diving into the budgeting process second semester. All three candidates running for student body vice president of finance in this year’s elections were members of the JFC during the fall and were, therefore, a part of that new program, and two of them did an exemplary job. Both Shanel Buchanan and Eric Wu met with all of their groups in the first semester, and I received several e-mails with praise directed at both of them for how accessible and helpful they were during the budgeting process. Whether Buchanan and Wu believe in continuing my initiative, or if they have their own approach to the problem, I have full confidence that they both share my ideal of fostering better, stronger relationships with student groups.
In the end, though Buchanan is a praiseworthy candidate, my vote in this election goes to Wu. Not only does he have a near-perfect committee attendance record — he has only missed a single meeting — but he takes a strong stance on the issues he cares about, presenting his own opinions while also being highly concerned with consistency and fairness. But perhaps most importantly, his work on the CMU Portal project (see www.cmuevent.org) attests to his initiative and passion for helping all Carnegie Mellon student organizations — not just the ones he is personally involved in — succeed and grow. This goal is directly aligned with the objectives of the JFC and the SBVPF position. After all, the ultimate mission of the JFC isn’t to allocate $1.2 million; it’s to promote the advancement of all Carnegie Mellon student organizations within our financial means.

In many places, fortune telling will get you snickers, a few sarcastic comments, and some cash from tourists passing through the carnival square. In Saudi Arabia, it gets you sentenced to death. We had hoped that government-sponsored witch hunts were an activity resigned to textbooks, but clearly not in Saudi Arabia.
Earlier this month, Ali Hussain Sibat, a Lebanese TV show host who predicted the futures of those willing to call the show, had his death sentence upheld in appeals court. Sibat has been held since May 2008, when he was arrested for “sorcery” by the Mutawa’een, Saudi Arabia’s religious police.
Amnesty International is calling on authorities to release him, stating, “The crime of ‘sorcery’ is not defined in Saudi Arabian law but is used to punish people for the legitimate exercise of their human rights, including the rights to freedom of thought, conscience, religion, belief, and expression.”
We at The Tartan, unsurprisingly, side with Amnesty and believe in allowing people in all nations to exercise freedom of thought, expression, and speech. Sorceresses, wizards, necromancers, warlocks, magicians, and psychics are all legitimate expressions of these freedoms. Allow them to practice their sleights of hand, to channel energies from ley lines, and to read from their crystal balls if people want to believe.

Each year the student body has the very important task of electing its future student representatives. As a student body, we are choosing who we want to represent our needs. But how important are student elections? What does the student government do? How do they impact our lives? This could be a potentially contentious debate, and the answers you receive depend on whom you speak with.
In reality, the role our elected student representatives play — serving students’ needs, graduate and undergraduate alike — is integral to the functions of Carnegie Mellon University. These needs range from forming new student initiatives to stewarding programs from the past and finding liaisons to interact with the administration and with the outside community.
I have been impressed by the impact that students can have, by either joining student government or by participating in student groups. Important initiatives that affect student life and the greater Pittsburgh community have been the result of successful student leadership.
There was a time directly after this country’s most recent Presidential election when a swell of opinion around the statement “Yes, we can” created a sense of optimism that increased political and public participation. And although the imagery and hype has subsided, the sentiment remains. As members of the Carnegie Mellon community, we do have the opportunity and ability to inspire and create change. 
Although we tend to connect with the intensity of systemic and global change, it is the smaller, locals and more community-focused changes that we take on as individuals that will truly impact those around us.
On behalf of the 2010 Elections Board, I invite you to vote this coming April 3–6. Let your voice be heard: Participate in the change, innovation, and student activity that occurs on campus each day. There are four university-wide executive positions: student body president and vice president, student body vice president for finance, and student body vice president for organizations. Undergraduates and graduates can all vote for these executives. Undergraduates will also be given the opportunity to vote for their representative to Student Senate, according to their home school.
Please join us in taking the first step to decide our own future as students. Elect those among us who can represent our needs and lead the way for change.
Andrew McIntire, Heinz College 
Co-chair, Elections Board

April 1 is National Census Day. And while you might not have known that, you probably are aware that the 2010 United States Census is already here. In addition to the national marketing campaign for the census, Carnegie Mellon has also been doing its part to encourage students to participate. Though it might seem like a nuisance, we’re excited that the administration has taken this stance. President Cohon recently e-mailed the campus community reminding us of the census and highlighting its value. Resident assistants will be following up, actually providing students with the appropriate forms. 
The slogan for this year’s census is “We can’t move forward until you mail it back.” We all acknowledge that census data is important. The information is used, according to the census website, to “advocate for causes, rescue disaster victims, prevent diseases, research markets, locate pools of skilled workers and more,” as well as allocate more than $400 billion to states and communities. 
Large, national changes have also been made. The census form has only 10 questions and should take only 10 minutes to complete. You can track census data online, real-time, with interactive maps that show the participation for various regions. Carnegie Mellon currently has a 35 percent response rate. The Census Bureau has also launched a TV ad campaign using census form-themed graphics, including personified ‘X’s, to demonstrate the importance of the census data. The ads stress issues from schools and roads to hospitals and community development, while incorporating a sleek design.
We are pleased to see that the university is taking an active role in promoting the 2010 Census, and hope that students will take it seriously as well.

Last week, President Obama accomplished perhaps the greatest task of his presidency: He made health care reform a reality with his partners in Congress. In a last-minute ploy to sway those Congressmen who needed to appease their pro-life or otherwise ill-informed constituents, Obama issued an executive order just before the passage of the bill on March 21. Underscoring the existing language of the bill that delineated this payment package, Obama explicitly stated that federal funding cannot be used to finance abortions.
Ultimately, though, what will change?
At the moment, it seems that nothing, really, will change. Physical access to elective abortion procedures should be the same after ratification as it was before the bill was signed into law. Resource centers such as Planned Parenthood still exist, will still provide medical and surgical abortion procedures around the United States, and will still do their best to ensure that women seeking pregnancy termination are able to find the funding to do so when they need it most. Doctors in other offices can still perform abortions as well — the only thing that might be different is who you pay for the procedure.
Public perception of the relationship between public health care and women’s fertility rights has indeed been altered, however. In the long run, those of us who see the right to an abortion and the overall control over one’s own reproductive health as inherently sacred might see a change for the better. That is, the outrage on the part of staunchly pro-choice groups, such as Planned Parenthood, to Obama’s executive order could incite a movement of more candid dialogue about women’s reproductive rights.
To my fellow pro-choicers, who understand that the reasons for which women might need to procure an abortion are incredibly complicated, I want to make a call to you: Never back off from fighting for women’s reproductive health rights, especially for women trapped in under-served communities or otherwise unsafe environments. However, do not turn against this significant piece of social legislation, which is inherently leftward-leaning and intended to serve those previously left unprotected in a world of ever-increasing insurance premiums. Use the language of this bill to move forward.
