This weekend, the Carnegie Mellon volleyball team hosted the DoubleTree Invitational at Skibo Gymnasium. The Tartans hosted five teams and played a total of four games over the course of Friday and Saturday, ultimately finishing the weekend 3–1 against the stiff competition.
In the first match of the weekend, Carnegie Mellon took on the University of Mary Washington and opened the invitational on a high note, winning 3–1. 
After eking out a win in the first set, 27–25, the team breezed through the second set 25–12. The Tartans stumbled in the third, falling 23–25, but ultimately put away Mary Washington 25–17 in the fourth and final set. Senior right setter Ali Celentano dominated the service game with five aces, while first-year outside hitter Heather Holton and Celentano racked up the kills for the Tartans with 11 and nine, respectively. 
Sophomore setter and opposite hitter Emily Newton and first-year setter Amanda Thiele led the team with 14 and 13 assists, respectively.
Next up for Carnegie Mellon was the 5th ranked University of Mount Union. The Tartans again took the first set, this time 25–23 before dropping the second 16–25. They then rallied and put away the nationally ranked opposition 25–14 and 25–23 in front of a packed home crowd. Celentano followed up the previous game with another five aces and increased her kill total to 22 over the course of the double header. Sophomore defensive specialist Molly Higgins spearheaded the defensive effort with 23 digs.
In the third match of the weekend, and the first on Saturday, the Tartans took on John Carroll University. There appeared to be a bit of a hangover following the big win over Mount Union, with Carnegie Mellon quickly falling. 
Not as devastating as the blowout losses last week, the Tartans were able to keep things competitive falling 24–26, 21–25 and 23–25. While the service game was slightly weaker than the night before, the major change was in the number of kills, with John Carroll nearly doubling the Tartans totals 53 to 27.
The final match of the weekend offered some semblance of redemption for Carnegie Mellon as they defeated La Roche College 3–1. They came out strong, just as they had in their previous wins 25–19, before falling in the second set 21–25. Determined to end the invitational on a high note, the Tartans won the remaining two sets 25–17 and 25–12. 
Newton and Thiele repeated their performances from earlier in the weekend against Mary Washington, again leading the team, this time with 14 assists a piece.
The Tartans play DePauw University next on Sunday at the College of Wooster.

After a mixed start to the season, the Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team has found its feet, as it capped off a fantastic week with a 4-0 thumping of Bethany College on Saturday, which came after a 2-1 victory at home against Washington & Jefferson College on Wednesday. 
The two victories move the Tartans to 5-3 for the season, and they now have a three-game winning streak, scoring nine goals and conceding only one.
The scorers for the first game were juniors midfielder Connor Webb and forward and midfielder Dimitrije Slavkovic, who scored their fourth and third goals of the season, respectively. 
In the second game, both Webb and Slavkovic, as well as sophomore midfielder Tristan Lockwood and first-year midfielder Jimmy Jameson, got on the scoresheet. 
Jameson netted the first goal of his career and Lockwood his first for this season.
The plan against Washington & Jefferson seemed to be containing the opposition in the first half and opening up the game more in the second.
While they did have a wobble in the second half — conceding a goal through a penalty — the team’s plan worked. 
The Tartans were in control of the game throughout; there were no real clear cut chances for the opponents and quite a few for themselves.
Against Bethany, the attacking unit racked up 28 shots, with 12 of them on target. 
The defense was resolute too — they kept a clean sheet and allowed their opponents only two shots with one on target saved by junior goalkeeper Eric Bykowsky.
Head coach Brandon Bowman stated after the game against the Washington & Jefferson Presidents that the coaches had been preaching team unity as an important factor through the beginning of the season. 
His team seems to have received the message loud and clear. They worked well as a unit and seemed to follow the coach’s instructions throughout the game. 
Bowman commented that it’s down to the whole team to perform, and they have done just that.
The Tartans now get a week off, playing on Sept. 27 at Grove City College.
The game will be the second game of a three-game road trip that ends with a game in Chicago.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s football team traveled to Washington & Jefferson College on Saturday, hoping to recover from their shutout at the hands of rival Case Western Reserve University two weeks prior. Unfortunately for the Tartans, the Presidents had a different idea and the Tartans ultimately fell 48–30.
Washington & Jefferson made their dominance clear on the first three possessions. After a 15-yard play and a 75-yard drive off of the opening kickoff, the Presidents held the Tartans to a quick three-and-out. Although a combination of first-year punter and kicker Tyler Kohman’s directional punting and a Washington & Jefferson penalty pushed the Presidents deep within their own territory, it only took two plays, a 17-yard run, and a 70-yard pass for the Tartans to be down two touchdowns less than seven minutes into the game.
To their credit, the Tartans responded with their own long drive, putting up their first points of the regular season and cutting the deficit to seven with an 18-yard pass from junior quarterback Andrew Hearon to junior wide receiver Chris Herrera. Carnegie Mellon then flexed its muscle on defense, forcing a quick three-and-out and getting the ball back to the offense in good field position. But Lady Luck was not on the Tartans’ side, as the drive was quickly stopped when sophomore running back Don Boyer fumbled away the football just three plays later.
The Presidents were able to convert their good field position into another touchdown and then led 21–7. Carnegie Mellon, boosted by a great return into 
Washington & Jefferson territory by first-year running back Sam Benger, was able to mount a response, culminating with a quarterback sneak by Hearon to finally punch it into the end zone and cut the deficit to seven.
Any momentum the Tartans had gained was quickly squashed in the next two drives, a long touchdown drive by the Presidents and an interception by Hearon in the red zone. The combination of stout defense and poor field position for Washington & Jefferson ended the scoring for the half, leaving the Tartans down 28–14.
The third quarter started similarly to how the second ended with the teams trading three-and-outs. Carnegie Mellon was starting to string together a drive when Hearon fumbled the ball. 
The Presidents quickly scored another touchdown to push the lead to 21, further burying the Tartans. While the game would not be officially over for another quarter, Washington & Jefferson eliminated any doubt about the contest’s victor with yet another touchdown near the end of the third quarter, pushing the lead to an insurmountable 28.
With pride on the line, Carnegie Mellon responded, if only to minimize the damage on the scoreboard. A drive spanning the end of the third quarter and start of the fourth culminated in a touchdown from Hearon to junior wide receiver Max Reinertsen, with the resulting onside kick recovery by first-year offensive linebacker Kyle Brittain keeping the Tartans’ slim hopes alive.
After a failed fourth down conversion, the Presidents needed only two plays to eliminate the progress Carnegie Mellon had made. The Tartans would score one more touchdown, but by the then, the game was already decided.
Carnegie Mellon returns home for the first time this season, taking on Geneva College this Saturday.

Since the July 31 nonwaiver trade deadline, Major League Baseball (MLB) standings have taken a bizarre turn. At the deadline, the Oakland Athletics had baseball’s best record by a significant margin. The Atlanta Braves and Washington Nationals were locked in a tight race for the National League (NL) East. 
The Milwaukee Brewers looked like a surefire playoff team, riding an excellent start to a midseason lead in the NL Central. The Detroit Tigers looked like they were going to walk leisurely to what feels like a 40th consecutive American League (AL) Central title.
None of those things are remotely true anymore due to a combination of deadline moves and baseball randomness.
The Oakland A's have been one of the worst teams in baseball since the trade deadline. After trading left fielder Yoenis Céspedes to the Boston Red Sox for ace starter Jon Lester, it appeared the A’s were gearing up for a World Series run. This was in addition to the acquisition of starter Jeff Samardzija earlier in the season. 
Céspedes had a great case as one of the most overrated players in baseball, as his back-to-back home run derby crowns could not mask an abysmal .298 on-base percentage at the deadline.
The A’s recent stumble has been bizarre and hard to make sense of. Lester has been very good, but a number of key players have cratered since the trade.
Catcher Derek Norris and first baseman Brandon Moss, two players who were having excellent seasons as major contributors to baseball’s best offense, have gone ice cold, providing very little pop to a lineup that switched out its biggest home run threat in Céspedes for utility fielders. Starters Scott Kazmir and Sonny Gray have both seen huge drops in effectiveness as their innings piled up.
The A’s, who were once a common pick to win the World Series, now see their playoff hopes in peril. They sit only a half game above the Kansas City Royals for the first wild card and two games above the Seattle Mariners for the second wild card.
The Braves were never supposed to be as good as they are. After great pitching took the team to the playoffs last year, they lost three starters in spring training. With very little everyday offensive talent in its lineup, the team was supposed to have a tough time repeating last season’s magic. 
For half the season, however, the starting rotation pitched very well. The expected contributions from ace Julio Tehran helped, but more important were guys like starter Aaron Harang succeeding seemingly out of nowhere. 
As of Tuesday, the Nationals have clinched the division, and the Braves are looking very far up at the Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Giants for wild card spots.
The Brewers are another team that seems to have lost their way since deadline day, which is particularly confusing since they did not make any notable moves. It seems that the whole team was either playing over its head and took longer than expected to regress to the mean, or torrid stretches from the Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals simply outpaced the Brew Crew. 
Finally, the rise of the Royals has been shocking and exciting. Perpetually tortured Royals fans might be treated to postseason baseball for the first time since their 1985 World Series victory, all due to several key changes since the trade deadline.
The Tigers seemed to be running away with their division, but some regression from starter Rick Porcello and terrible defensive play from their infield mired the Tigers. In what was an extended cold streak through August, the Royals were given the chance to heat the race up. 
Several Royals players also finally seem to have found their swings despite brutal early season struggles. The crown jewels of the Royals’ farm system, first baseman Eric Hosmer and third baseman Mike Moustakas, were absolutely terrible for most of the season. 
Hosmer was eventually injured and Moustakas was sent to the minors. Upon return, both players have been putting up okay base numbers and surprising power numbers.
Royals starters Danny Duffy and Yordano Ventura were good for the first half of the season and have been excellent since the deadline, with starter James Shields upping his play as well. This team has an amazing bullpen, with closer Greg Holland flanked by Wade Davis, the most effective reliever in the majors this year. 
Often the excitement of the postseason buries what goes on in the regular season. This A’s collapse could be remembered for a very long time, but minor changes since the trade deadline have drastically altered the course of the MLB. 
These last few games and the postseason should offer even more excitement in what, so far, has been a thrilling season.

What does the future hold for Manchester United?
After all the euphoria caused by Manchester United’s unbeaten preseason under Louis van Gaal, the world came crashing down for the fans and the club. 
They lost their first game, at home to Swansea City 2–1. A lot of the same problems were evident during the game: United was not inventive, there were too many wasted possessions, and crosses seemed like the only outlet for attack. Of course, the defense was nothing short of calamitous.
It was all too reminiscent of outgoing manager David Moyes’s teams. When van Gaal took over, he splurged like United had never splurged before, bringing in defender Marcos Rojo, versatile defensive midfielder Daley Blind, and two world class signings in striker Radamel Falcao (on loan) and midfielder Ángel Di María, the latter for a British record fee of 59.7 million pounds. Results did not improve as United still drew 1–1 at Sunderland and 0–0 at Burnley.
The worst, however, came when they were thrashed by Milton Keynes Dons, a League One team, 4–0 in the Capital One Cup. The international break came at a welcome time when the manager got time to integrate the signings and tweak the tactics, as well as formation of the team. 
The first game after the break went well — the team scored a sound 4–0 victory over the hapless Queens Park Rangers (QPR). It was a fantastic performance, with Di María proving he was worth all that money. 
So where exactly does United go from here? What should the fans expect from this team that has been letting them down time and again?
First, it would be ignorant to get carried away with hype after just one good performance. Truth be told, QPR did not offer much going forward and was in shambles defensively. Against a stingier defense, United may have still struggled, but the linkup play between Di María and midfielder Ander Herrera, another new signing, was encouraging. United was also far from their best defensively, with the clean sheet a misleading fact.
Van Gaal switched to a back four instead of a back five, and though the coordination was better, the communication between the defenders and the keeper was still shaky. David de Gea, arguably United’s best and most consistent performer in nearly two years now, had uncharacteristic problems in goal. 
Rojo, meanwhile, started at left back this game, but it is likely that he will partner with Jones in the middle once new signing, Luke Shaw, is match fit. Evans and Blackett will both probably drop to the bench. 
Rafael was fantastic against QPR, providing the attacking spark from the back United has missed since the Sir Alex Ferguson days after Moyes’s criminal mismanagement of his full backs.
Moving forward, United should take note of how the diamond formation worked for them this game. The team lined up in a 4–1–2–1–2 format, with Blind playing the holding midfielder, Di María and Herrera playing the shuttlers and Juan Mata playing in his favored No. 10 role behind the strike duo of Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie. This formation lets van Gaal play almost all of his new signings in their favored positions.
Di María as a left midfielder in this formation is arguably in the top five players in the world. And Mata is up there with the best too. With van Persie’s form dipping recently, it is likely that Falcao will take his place in the lineup. Teen prodigy Adnan Januzaj will also be able to get meaningful minutes as either the No. 10, where everyone sees his future lie, or as a support striker, a position he is comfortable playing.
The only issue with this formation is the demand it places on the full backs to provide the width and cover defensively. 
Fortunately for them, United is adequately stocked at both positions; Antonio Valencia provides cover at right back and Rojo, Blackett, Blind and youngster Reece James are all able to play left back instead of Shaw when needed. 
Once Micheal Carrick returns, United will have sufficient depth in midfield too, something they haven’t been able to say since 2008.
The early signs are encouraging after the QPR game that van Gaal is getting his message across to the team. He has placed extra emphasis on team bonding activities, such as dinners and interviews with each other while also ensuring that each and every non-English speaking member of the squad is taking lessons to become fluent. Van Gaal is looking at United’s problems from the grass-root level and overhauling the entire system of the club.
It seems like the team is finally moving on from the Sir Alex days. For their sake, let’s hope the QPR game wasn’t a flash in the pan. Let’s hope that Manchester United are on their way back to where they belong — on top of English football.

The production of useful artificial organs has long been a goal in the field of medical science, but it has not been achieved due to many restraints with current technology. 
Keith Cook, an associate professor of biomedical engineering, recently received a four-year, $2.4 million grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to study new technologies to develop artificial lungs that can be used for months at a time.
“Millions of people suffer from chronic lung disease,” Cook said. Unfortunately, there is a disparity between the number of people who need lung transplants and the number of lung donors. Additionally, patients are currently required to stay at the hospital to receive proper support. In this kind of situation, patients also need to find a donor quickly, or they risk further harm, and possibly death. This stark difference between supply and demand drives a very real need for artificial lungs. In his research, Cook looks at patients that ultimately might not receive lung transplants, as well as those who are too sick to get transplants and need some stabilization in order to receive them.
Cook’s planned artificial lung would help alleviate these problems by allowing those patients to rely on a device that would not clot for over three months, which could have applications for not only artificial lung devices but any device that uses blood. 
In addition, he hopes to integrate these devices into patients’ homes, which would allow patients to avoid spending their time in a hospital ward while still receiving all the care they require. Patients would have little work, while the physicians or biomedical engineers could monitor the patient and intercede when the device nears failure. Cook estimated that the lungs could be used in hospitals in five to 10 years.
There are some working artificial lungs available now, but they prove useful for a month at most. One method currently used in hospitals involves extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In this process, a machine functions as an artificial lung by infusing oxygen into the blood, removing carbon dioxide, and returning the blood to the patient. However, this process is expensive and intensive. In order for the standard gas exchange to occur, a polypropylene membrane is used. The walls of the fibers are porous, allowing blood plasma to leak into the gas side or bubbles from the gas side to leak into the blood stream. Plasma leakage can destroy the gas exchange function of the lung, and air leakage can cause death in the patient.
A solid fiber such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) eliminates plasma and gas leakage. However, the long-term function of these fibers is unknown. Because both of these materials provide advantages and problems that need to be overcome, Cook is currently working with both types to try to create a membrane that could last longer. For example, coating the polypropylene with PDMS may prove useful. However, neither of the methods are currently ready.
In a human body, endothelial cells keep the blood from coagulating. However, other materials run into many problems due to the lack of vascular endothelial cell linings in foreign materials. Although researchers have been attempting to create endothelial linings, it has been extremely difficult to do so. As a result, “people control or learn to live with it,” Cook said.
He explained that people largely deal with anticoagulants, which are drugs that slow down the blood clotting process, although this creates concerns such as making sure the patient doesn’t bleed more than usual. Because the endothelial cells have many complex properties, Cook is trying to mimic these properties one at a time. Cook believes that mimicking their properties may lead to better materials for the artificial lungs, and eliminate the challenge inherent in working with endothelial cells themselves.
As more work is done on the artificial lungs, Cook believes it will become a viable device for people with chronic lung disease and other lung problems. With Cook’s designs for the device, he hopes to increase the longevity of the device by decreasing coagulation on the foreign materials and using materials that would allow for successful lung function.

In 2012, Facebook conducted a study to determine how the contents of users’ news feeds affect their behavior. In particular, they showed some users a more positive news feed and others a more negative news feed and showed that the users’ posts became more positive in the positive condition and more negative in the negative condition. 
When this study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America earlier this year, it caused a major outcry among Facebook users. Thus, Pugwash sought to understand whether this experiment was ethical, and whether Facebook or the government should do something about it.
Members first explored the consequences of an experiment like this one. It was determined that the Facebook users were affected in an apparently minor way: Their emotions were altered to be somewhat more positive or negative. While people with depression might have done things to permanently harm themselves in the case of added negative emotions, by and large, this kind of emotional impact isn’t outside the scope of daily life. However, what’s more important is that this experiment set a precedent that it is okay for a corporation like Facebook to perform experiments on its users and publish the results.
It’s easy to imagine research that Facebook might conduct — secretly or openly — in its own best interest that’s considerably more harmful; for instance, lying to users to see their behavior. Should corporations be able to conduct this type of research on their own? And should public funds be allocated to research that is associated with such corporate experimentation?
The public funding question is somewhat easier to answer, since there are already established ethical guidelines from the famous Belmont Report which stipulates the conditions under which the government can fund human subjects research. To a certain extent, the public’s trust of scientific experimentation is already founded on this document, and therefore, it makes sense to hold it as sacred, unless something is found to be seriously wrong with it.
For an experiment like this one — which involves actually manipulating a human being — the Belmont Report requires ‘informed consent’: that the user should know that he or she will undergo experimentation, and that he or she can opt out if desired. In this case, the researchers almost had informed consent, since Facebook’s terms of service do say that users agree to participate in research.
However, the terms of service also say that the research will only be used internally. Furthermore, the vast majority of Facebook users don’t read the terms of service. In the Belmont Report, it’s the researcher’s responsibility to make sure the participant understands the consent; a statement buried in a huge document that the participant signs is not enough. In this sense, Facebook and these researchers likely overstepped their bounds. However, the majority opinion in Pugwash seemed to be that the infraction was minor, especially since the government did not do very much to fund this research (the actual experiment was funded by Facebook).
Whether Facebook and other Internet giants should be allowed to carry out such research is another matter. This kind of experimentation is largely unprecedented in corporate circles.
Fifty years ago, corporations had no way to precisely monitor users’ interactions with their products, so they had little to gain by altering the experience for some users. Of course, companies did experiment with human subjects — for instance, the drug industry couldn’t exist without human drug trials — but for those experiments there was never any ambiguity about whether a given person was participating. For the drug industry, these trials are heavily regulated. However, these laws don’t apply to Internet-based research.
For Internet experimentation, the prevailing interpretation of the law seems to be that Facebook owns the feed, it is their product, and so it’s up to them what they put in it. The assumption here is that text and images are not dangerous or unpredictable, at least not to the extent that untested drugs are. If people feel Facebook is degrading their experience, they can just leave.
Thus, it can be argued that it’s in Facebook’s best interest not to do things that may harm or anger their users. But is this really true?
For an experiment like this one, it wasn’t clear whether the negativity came from Facebook or from the users’ friends. Facebook can easily be deceptive in other ways in these experiments, and this violates one of the assumptions of a free market. Furthermore, it isn’t clear that users can get away from Facebook anymore. Much of what human society calls networking has now moved to Facebook, to the extent that it’s a serious competitive disadvantage not to use it — for example, during job searches.
Overall, though, regulating Facebook seems like a heavy-handed solution to a problem that is currently minor. Ultimately, Pugwash did not come to a firm conclusion regarding how such a regulation could be implemented.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on the Facebook news feed experiment.

Migraines and other types of severe headaches have baffled the medical community for thousands of years. As medical knowledge of migraines increased, treatments also improved, advancing from trepanation — the drilling of holes into the skull — to modern preventive medications and lifestyle changes.
Today, migraines are defined as neurological disorders characterized by severe head pain and other nervous system symptoms such as loss of vision, nausea, and numbness. Although migraines are often described as severe headaches, the two conditions are actually separate disorders.
Migraines are generally caused by the dilation of blood vessels, while headaches involve the constriction of blood vessels. Headache symptoms are generally restricted to head pain, whereas migraines often include a variety of symptoms. In addition to severe head pain, migraines can be characterized by an aura (lines, bright light, patterns, or blind spots that inhibit vision), euphoria, hallucinations, nausea, weakness, numbness, and cognitive problems such as difficulty speaking or hearing.
The specific neurological cause of migraines is still unknown. Migraines are initiated by a trigger, which can be a variety of simple events, such as a change in routine or hormones, as well as environmental factors like loud noises, bright lights, and high heights.
Originally, doctors believed that migraines consisted solely of the dilation of blood vessels in the brain after the initial trigger. Today, however, it is believed that migraines are actually composed of several distinct, sequential events in the brain.
After the initial trigger, nociceptors, cells that sense pain, identify the trigger and release neuropeptides, compounds involved in the transmission of signals in the nervous system. These compounds bind to other nociceptors in the surrounding area and cause them to be more sensitive to pain and, therefore, release more neuropeptides. The released neuropeptides induce a variety of changes within the brain. Namely, they affect the muscles around the blood vessels on the surface of the brain and cause the muscles to relax. This relaxation causes the blood vessels to dilate. They also cause cranial vessels to leak, which results in swelling of the brain tissue. Together, increased pain sensitivity, brain tissue swelling, and blood vessel dilation cause migraines.
Doctors today are also aware of several risk factors for migraines including gender, age, and family history. Women are more at risk than men for migraines. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, approximately 75 percent of all migraine sufferers are women. Migraines are also more common in people between the ages of 15 and 55. Furthermore, migraines run in families. About 70 percent of migraine patients have a history of migraines in their family.
Migraines, like many other illnesses, come in a variety of different forms. The three most common forms of migraines are called classic migraines, common migraines, and ocular migraines. A classic migraine is a migraine with head pain and an aura. Migraines without an aura are called common migraines, and can be characterized by euphoria or cognitive problems along with severe head pain. Ocular migraines are migraines that have an aura, but lack head pain. Abdominal migraines also occur; they lack head pain and an aura, but still involve the symptoms of a migraine (such as increased sense perception and nausea). People are classified as having chronic migraines if they have more than 15 migraines a month. Migraine treatment can be either acute, after migraine onset, or preventive, before migraine onset. Acute treatment often includes household drugs such as Tylenol and Advil (ibuprofen). 
Although this type of treatment is generally taken after symptoms start, it is most effective if taken before head pain begins. This is particularly effective for people who experience an aura before the onset of head pain. Acute treatment can also involve triptans, a medication that mimics serotonin, which is a chemical that regulates mood.
Preventive treatment is common for people diagnosed with chronic migraines. This type of treatment usually involves various medications or lifestyle changes. Antidepressants, which alter serotonin levels, have been shown to be effective in preventing migraines. Various cardiovascular medications and anti-seizure medications have also been shown to prevent migraines. Lifestyle changes that limit the amount of variation in a person’s daily life can also be effective.
Despite substantial developments in the understanding and treatment of migraines, there are still many unanswered questions that could lead to more effective diagnosis and treatment of migraines.

White House to fight antibiotic resistance
Though the problem of antibiotic resistance has troubled hospitals and communities for decades, new genome-sequencing technologies that inspect bacterial genomes can be used to sketch out a molecular family tree, which could provide researchers with more data regarding antibiotic resistance. To support genome-sequencing technology and develop a new national strategy to fight resistant bacteria, President Barack Obama signed an executive order on Sept. 18 recognizing antibiotic resistance and creating a task force to combat the issue. The order came as a response to a report released on the same day by the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology encouraging further research on this topic. The White House also announced a $20 million prize for the development of rapid tests that can identify antibiotic-resistant infections.

Single dose of antidepressant changes the brain
SSRIs (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors) are one of the most common kinds of antidepressants prescribed. However, it is unclear what the exact effect of the drug is on the brain. A recent study conducted by Julia Sacher of the Max Plank Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences suggests that a single dose of antidepressant not only dramatically changes brain connectivity but also does so in a matter of hours.
In the study, participants were monitored in a brain scanner as they were allowed to let their mind wander for about 15 minutes and then monitored again after taking a single dose of escitalopram, better known as Lexapro. By comparing 3–D images of connections occurring in the participants’ brains, the researchers found that one dose of Lexapro reduces the level of connectivity in most of the brain.

Theory of relativity applicable to superheavy elements
Researchers have recently created the first chemical compound whose behavior can only be explained with Einstein’s theory of relativity. Researchers at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Germany have combined the 106th element of the periodic table, seaborgium, with six carbon monoxide molecules. Although other superheavy elements have never exhibited relativistic behavior before, this one seems different. As the team measured its volatility and reactivity, the values were similar to those for compounds of molybdenum and tungsten — which are in the same group as seaborgium in the periodic table — with carbon monoxide. This behavior can agree with the theoretical model only if Einstein’s theory of relativity is taken into account. The researchers plan to perform further tests on heavier elements to test such relativistic effects.

New materials used for computer processors
A recent processor designed by researchers from several universities around the world uses phase change materials (PCMs), which may be able to change computers in the future. The calculations performed by most electronics today are carried out by silicon-based logic devices. However, PCMs have the advantage of being able to reversibly switch between two electrical states in mere billionths of a second. These materials have the potential to make the processing speed of future computers 1,000 times faster than they are now.
PCMs were first developed in the 1960s and were used in optical-memory devices. But now, they have begun to take the place of traditional silicon-based memory in some smartphones. As it turns out, PCMs-based processors use less energy, making them not only faster but also more environmentally friendly.

Study reveals effect of artificial sweeteners on body
Researchers have found that artificial sweeteners may disrupt the body’s blood sugar regulation, thus causing metabolic changes that can lead to diabetes. Even though previous studies on the effects of artificial sweeteners have had conflicting conclusions, this report has earned many positive responses from scientists. The researchers performed experiments on mice to back up their assertion that the sweeteners change the population of bacteria in the digestive system.
A control-group experiment found that there was little change in the mice that drank water or sugar water while mice that received artificial sweeteners developed a clear intolerance to glucose. However, at present the scientists still cannot explain how the sweeteners affect the bacteria and what exactly results in the changes from the glucose metabolism.

World population to reach 11 billion by mid-century
Most estimates in the past 20 years predicted that the human population would grow to around 10 billion by mid-century, a number that now seems to be an underestimate. It was previously assumed that the decline in birth rate in Africa is occurring at the same pace as declines in other regions (for example, Asia). However, it turns out the rate of fertility decline has slowed (and even reversed) in some African countries in the last 15 years. 
At current rates, scientists believe Africa will likely become as densely populated as today’s China. As Hans Rosling, an international health researcher at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, expects, the world should prepare for at least 11 billion people by mid-century.

American singer-songwriter Moby visited Kresge Theatre while passing through Pittsburgh to perform a DJ set at the 2nd annual Thrival music festival on Sept. 14. However, instead of playing his popular electronic music, the singer-songwriter and DJ spoke about his experience with music as therapy.
Moby said that, as a young musician, he fought to find purpose with his work. He knew that he loved to create music and was happy with his career, but there was always an underlying feeling that it was not substantial enough. This all changed when Moby discovered the Institute for Music and Neurological Functioning (IMNF), a non-profit organization that is part of the CenterLight Health System. The New York-based company is dedicated to studying and developing effective musical treatment for neurological damage and disorder. IMNF was founded in 1995 by Dr. Concetta Tomaino with help from therapist Oliver Sacks. The IMNF is a worldwide leader in the research of music-based therapy.
Neurogenesis is the natural process through which stem cells generate new neurons. A healthy, active lifestyle is known to be conducive to neurogenesis, but Tomaino and Sacks found that music is actually one of the most effective stimulants of neurogenesis. During his lecture, Moby recalled instances of Tomaino’s and Sacks’s research that revealed just how effective music therapy could be. For example, he explained that he witnessed a mute woman sing and a crippled man tap his feet when one of their favorite songs were playing. Playing music has also proved to be extraordinarily beneficial in reducing stress and increasing endorphin output. Current research projects of the IMNF include seeing if music therapy improves the health of those in home care and reduces emergency room trips and how making music can treat depression.
Moby pointed out that the only way for music therapy to be effective is for the patient to have emotional ties to the music. Listening to music that is meaningless does not stimulate one’s brain. However, it is not difficult to create emotional ties to music. Whether it brings tears to your eyes or reminds you of that amazing summer three years ago, music prompts profound emotions. “Imagine a wedding with no music, or a funeral with no music,” Moby said. It is natural for people to tie music to a variety of emotional situations.
Moby takes this to heart in the creation of his own music. He said he strives to create music that elicits emotions within himself with the hopes that others have similar reactions. Moby urges people to use music as therapy in their own lives, as it has proven to be a cheap and effective way to stimulate neurogenesis and reduce stress hormones. As it turns out, listening to and creating music is just another aspect of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

Before you throw the paper away in disgust and turn to your bacon for comfort, hear me out. A vegetarian lifestyle may not be for everyone, but neither is the carnivorous track. Every once in a while, it’s good to set the steaks aside and go for a nice veggie roast. Here are some recipes that can be exclusively sides or vamped up and turned into a meal.
Zucchini-Corn Fritters
The most amazing thing about this recipe, besides the taste of course, is the amount of water you have to drain from the zucchini before you mix in everything else. It’s positively mind-boggling. When you do it yourself, you’ll understand why you absolutely cannot skip that step. You will end up with a soggy mess that stains everything it touches green. You’ve been warned.
2 good-sized zucchinis
½ can of corn
¼ cup of flour
1 tablespoon of cornstarch
1 egg
Plenty of salt, pepper, and red pepper
Plenty of vegetable oil for frying
1) Start by shredding the zucchini into a medium bowl. Strain as much of the water out of the zucchini as possible. The best way to do this is to start the old-fashioned way and make a zucchini snowball with your hands. Squeeze the zucchini ball and try not to gag while the juice squelches out. Repeat about three times. Then, put the ball back into the bowl, wash your hands, and sprinkle the zucchini with salt. The salt extracts the water from the zucchini, but it’ll take about 10 minutes for that to happen. Be patient. Just go scroll through Facebook or something. It’s worth it.
2) Whew. If you got through that, you’re basically done. 
3) Pour about a tablespoon or two of oil into a pan, and turn the heat up. It’s about to get hot in here.
4) Mix in the corn, then the egg, and then add the cornstarch and flour.
5) Season to taste with the red pepper, black pepper, and salt.
6) Form patties with your hands and fry them lightly in the pan. Mmmm.
This recipe was inspired in part by bonappetit.com.
The World’s Fanciest Brussels Sprouts
What are the worst two vegetables in the world? Brussels sprouts and artichokes. It’s an indisputable and universal truth. Naturally, that means that the true talent in cooking these vegetables lies in well, lying. You have to empower the Brussels sprouts to be more than a vegetable … they have to be anything but. The solution here is butter and seasoning. This recipe uses just a dab of butter and delicious fresh rosemary to spruce up a boring old bunch of sprouts. Classic. Pair this with pasta and turn it into dinner.
1 bag of Brussels sprouts 
Olive oil
1 tablespoon of butter
3 or 4 sprigs of fresh rosemary (don’t panic, just look for the herbs at GEagle)
¼ cup of lemon juice
Salt and pepper
1) Wash the Brussels sprouts and cut them in half. Put the halves in a bowl.
2) Drizzle them with olive oil. Not so much that it’s dripping, but enough to make the herbs and salt stick to the sprouts. 
3) Season the sprouts with generous salt and pepper. Strip the rosemary leaves off of the stem (otherwise, it’s basically like eating a stick) and add them to the mix as well. Set this aside, and let it marinate as you move on. 
4) Heat the butter in a pan. Just as it starts to melt and slide around, pour the sprouts in with it. Get ready to concentrate.
5) Pay attention while the sprouts are cooking. It’s easy to burn them. They’ll need to cook for a while because they’re fairly tough, and it’s unpleasant to have a mouthful of uncooked Brussels sprouts.
6) While the sprouts are cooking, make sure to turn them over so the outside leaves don’t burn. The layers are the big challenge here. Stick with it.
7) You know that the Brussels sprouts are cooked when you can easily stab one with a fork. At that point, take them out of the pan, and voilà. You have a beautiful bowl of well-seasoned sprouts.
Farm Fresh Bruschetta, or a pile of vegetables on toasted bread
Appetizer no more, this bruschetta is strong, bold, spicy, and substantial. Two or three pieces of this bad boy, and you’ll be bursting. Make sure to use a nice loaf of Italian bread with a thick crust for a solid base and a layer of cheese to separate the juices from the vegetables from the fragile, golden crust of the bread — unless, of course, you like your bruschetta soggy and caving in. 
1 loaf of Italian bread with thick crust, sliced
1 tomato
1 zucchini
1 white onion
4 cloves of garlic
2 peppers, red or yellow
Sliced mozzarella cheese (or whichever cheese strikes your fancy)
Olive oil
Salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, basil flakes, and paprika
Butter
1) Start with some old-fashioned slice and dice. Cut the vegetables (tomato, zucchini, onion, and peppers) into small cubes instead of long, thin slices. That way they’ll sit better on the bread. Set them aside and have them ready.
2) While you’re heating some olive oil in a pan, crush the garlic. To do this, peel the cloves apart and take off the first layer of peel (it’s usually already flaking off). Turn the knife so that the flat side is parallel to the cutting board, and use your palm to crush the clove. The clove should pop open, and the peel will have burst, making it easy to peel off. Slice the clove, and toss it into the olive oil with the onions.
3) After the onions have started cooking and are getting more tender, add the peppers and zucchini. Let everything stew for a bit, then add the spices. Taste the mix to see if you need more of something.
4) While the vegetables are cooking, melt some butter in another pan. When it’s melted, put the bread on top and lightly toast it on both sides. Don’t burn it!
5) When the bread is done toasting, put the cheese on top and set it aside. The cheese should melt slightly onto the bread, effectively sealing in the toasted flavor and the crispy crust.
6) Taste the vegetables to see if they’re cooked. Everything should be tender and spiced appropriately. Add the tomatoes at the last minute and stir them around with everything else. By saving them for last, you can make sure that they won’t fall apart on you.
7) When everything is done, use a slotted spoon to spoon the veggies onto the bread. You can go back with the leftover bread later and sop up the juices. Ta-dah!

Located in the Miller Gallery on campus between the Jared L. Cohon University Center and Warner Hall, the multimedia exhibit, curated by Casey Droege, features pieces from artists such as Edith Abeyta, Michael Lewis Miller, Gavin Benjamin, David Bernabo, Alexis Gideon, Ulric Joseph, Jessica Langley, Celeste Neuhaus, and Drew Droege. The exhibit, which is part of the 2014 Pittsburgh Biennial, is open from Sept. 20 to Nov. 30.
Catching Power by Ulric Joseph features a series of oil paintings that depict themes of corruption, materialism, culture shock, and racism. All paintings in the exhibit feature interesting use of color and glitter. The glitter mixes into the colors of the paintings, making it difficult to immediately discern, warranting another look. The paintings depicting cultural and native life in Trinidad, Joseph’s home country, use vibrant primary colors. As a result, the colorful background and clothing heavily contrasts against the dark skin of Joseph’s subjects, accenting his technically competent detail. One such painting, which shows two Trinidadian women with head wraps and colorful red dresses, features large fake gems. It’s clear that Joseph wishes to contrast his Trinidadian upbringing with American consumerism and culture.
In “Predator,” Joseph uses toned down earthy colors to create an ominous atmosphere. The painting consists of a stalking black man on a grassy plain, looking straight at the viewer while wearing a large gold chain and earring. Joseph challenges his audience by relaying his experience of being generalized as violent simply due to his skin color. To challenge this view, Joseph has a set of portraits depicting faces of African American people smiling at different angles. Joseph’s style carries across facial expressions quite well, and it’s clear that he wishes to humanize the often brutalized black man, a minority he feels has been unfairly judged as violent and materialistic.
Another favorite was Video Muses III: Floating Oceans by Alexis Gideon. A multimedia presentation, Gideon uses the unexpected medium of claymation to tackle heavy ideas, such as existentialism and consumerism.
The video is accompanied by very percussion-heavy music and narration in the form of rap. The rhythm of the video is very thematic in nature, as Gideon explores the nature of dreams and memory in our daily lives; the rhythm of the percussion and spoken work tend to mutate to match. For example, when the protagonist of the video is pondering the crushing mundanity of everyday life, the rapping and percussive beat becomes very uniform and steady, lending to the emotional impact of the scene.
In contrast, the dream sequences feature spaced out, syncopated, surreal rhythms. Memories and dreams feature a unique visual style as well. In dreams, 2-D pictures are interspersed with claymation to give a surreal feel to the dream, as if details are omitted. Memories are also heavily stylized, to reflect the fact that a memory of something is as unreliable as a dream. Memorable scenes include a window washer, who, as he slips, desperately tries to carve his name into the building’s scaffolding before he falls to his death, and a portrayal of two men eternally bidding over a tattered brown coat.
These are but two of the exhibits on display at the Miller Gallery, most of which contain high quality art. Plus, there is the possibility of talking to the artists if you go during a presentation, which is far too good an opportunity for the newbies and aficionados alike to pass up.

The FOX comedy series New Girl saw its season premiere on Tuesday, and it appears that creator Liz Meriwether is following through on her promise to “sex things up.”
Let’s get this out of the way. Yes, five 30-somethings still live together. Yes, five 30-somethings are all still single. Yes, five 30-somethings still do everything with each other. Get over it; it’s fictional television.
The episode starts off with the problem most 30-somethings are depicted as having to deal with: the summer wedding season. It’s the tail end of the season, and you can tell the toll it has had on Jess (Zooey Deschanel). Her break up with Nick (Jake Johnson) is still fresh and settling like a The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills cast member’s newly remodeled face.
Not much has changed since viewers left the gang in the third season finale. Everyone is still single, and with this being the last wedding of the season, Schmidt (Max Greenfield) decrees, “we are hooking up tonight, all five of us.” 
And with a Game of Thrones reference — winter is coming — the gang is off.
The wedding ceremony ends and as the party starts up, Jess sets her big, blue, doughy eyes on “wedding celebrity” best man Ted (Reid Scott, or Dan on Veep). However, no path to victory is smooth. Enter Kat (Jessica Biel, Mrs. Justin Timberlake), who is never tired, technically a genius, and lost her virginity to Malcolm Gladwell (Google him. I had to. It’s worth the extra laugh).
Jess and Kat do what they call the “Joe Biden,” a.k.a. stalk Ted throughout the entire episode. (Side note: how come that doesn’t creep him out?) As the night winds down, Ted cannot make up his mind. Kat gets bored and goes home with a priest, and Jess, feeling undervalued, gives up on Operation Get Laid.
Elsewhere in the episode, Schmidt and Nick contemplate a foursome with two bridesmaids (Nick is more reluctant than Schmidt, naturally). But when newly single Cece (Hannah Simone) returns from Australia, it shakes Schmidt (who is admittedly still in love with Cece), and he ultimately decides not to go through with the foursome, much to Nick’s relief.
On the other side of the wedding venue, Coach (Damon Wayans Jr.) keeps running into the women he has slept with during the wedding circuit this summer. This includes waiters, young partygoers, older partygoers, bartenders, and photographers. It seems as though he has exhausted his resources, for this year, at least. And due to his exhaustive workouts in the police academy, Winston’s (Lamorne Morris) sore muscles and immobility mean that his ice packs are his best chance of bringing something home. 
The night ends with everyone heading back to the apartment to get drunk and make fun of all the married couples on their night of singularity.
New Girl premiered Sept. 16 and is scheduled to air every Tuesday at 9 p.m. on FOX.

First time writer-director Ned Benson has created The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby, an ambitious love story that functions as a three-part series through the perspectives of its romantic duo. “Him” and “Her” are each filmed in the subjective narrative of Connor Ludlow (James McAvoy) and Eleanor Rigby (Jessica Chastain), while “Them” is meant to function as the most objective journey through the couple’s relationship and eventual downfall.
While the title of the film is just plain silly, McAvoy and Chastain are wonderful in their portrayal of two people struggling with loss and nostalgia. It’s mainly their performances that uplifts “Them,” especially in moments when the film fails.
“Them” starts with a flashback of Connor and Eleanor (yes, her name is a silly allusion to the Beatles song) still in the honeymoon phases of their marriage, giddily playing dine-and-dash at a restaurant and running away to a nearby park. In the midst of a makeout session, cued by fireflies to celebrate their union, Connor then utters the very cheesy line “Hey, Rigby. There’s only one heart in this body. Have mercy on my soul.” They kiss in a moment of pure bliss.
Flash forward to the present, as Eleanor attempts suicide by jumping off a bridge. What caused Eleanor to be so unhappy so fast? The film reveals the answer much later as it weaves through Connor and Eleanor’s lives as newly estranged spouses. This marks the “disappearance” that is referred to in the film’s obnoxious title as not Eleanor’s absence in Connor’s life, but rather the complete demise of who Eleanor once was. The utter loss that Eleanor, in particular, grapples with results in the extinguishment of any desire for her to continue living for herself and for Connor.
“Them” is unique through its elegant vision and delicate performances. It’s pacing is deliberate and elusive, as if shifts between the narratives of the two characters as well as through random flashbacks. The ephemerality of the pacing intentionally functions like that of memories, not centered on plot or cinematic style but, rather, on how Connor and Eleanor subjectively remember their marriage and the aftermath.
For the most part, “Them” separates the couple, trying to show how Eleanor and Connor are dealing with this unspoken tragedy. Unfortunately, the filmmakers don’t do a great job of showing this reaction. Eleanor and Connor experience moments of affection, regret, and joy. They are beautiful memories that show the love and selflessness that the couple had for one another. But it quickly fades away as they revert back to their original positions of moping.
Sure, these are genuinely flawed characters, but this constant return to bitter brooding is what makes the film so annoying to endure for two hours. The point of film in general is to explore human conflict, pain, and eventual recovery. “Them” nailed down the conflict and the pain, but skipped out on the recovery.
Overall, The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby fails to be a fulfilling film. And not in a way that would magically tie itself up in a happy ending with a ribbon on top. Its failure lies in its inability to show how Eleanor and Connor interact with the world, in a way that would show how their loss and troubles manifest themselves in a tangible way. Yes, for two hours we watch Connor and Eleanor sulking around the streets of New York with a brooding sensibility, but nothing in their relationship is furthered by this in any way. They put on a facade of “letting go” by giving in to their constricting circumstances, never allowing the opportunity for them to fully heal from their marriage. The exploration of tragedy, in this case, is elegantly displayed but ends up being frustrating as the aftermath is never fully realized.

It’s weird that James Blake, considering the style on his latest album, was first compartmentalized as a dubstep artist.
Have you heard Overgrown? No? “Save yourself first.”
The remix of “Life Round Here” is an interesting track. Blake’s voice floats over a beautiful electronic atmosphere of blossoming synthesizers and light drums until Chano (Chance the Rapper) jumps on the track out of nowhere in the same fierce way that Andre 3000 leaps on “Do Ya Thang,” the surprisingly slamming song Andre teamed with the Gorillaz and James Murphy to produce for Converse sneakers.
You have to love it when a talented producer and a skilled rapper collaborate, and that’s exactly what happens here.

Dear Evan,
It’s Saturday night, and I’m drunkenly stumbling around Shadyside trying to find my way home, and my phone is dead. Here, this large patch of grass looks like a nice place to rest. Should I just sleep here for a couple hours?
Incoherently,
Plodding Homeward, In Repose as Intruder on Plot
Dear RIP PHI,
Something very similar happened to one of my old roommates. 
He decided to sleep there, but a policewoman picked him up. The kind woman invited him — well, shoved him — into the back of her vehicle, escorted him back to his apartment — which ended up being a block and a half away — and knocked on one of his roommate’s doors (my door).
“Is this his apartment?” she asked, pointing to a sheepishly grinning roommate. Meanwhile, I was experiencing rapidly fluctuating emotions somewhere between pissed at being woken up, and frightened at there being a policewoman standing in my living room.
Apparently, he wasn’t fined or cited. So yeah, go ahead and sleep on the guy’s lawn. You can probably get the police to take you home!
Or just don’t go drinking alone,
Evan Kahn
Dear Evan,
How do I get a third helping of ice cream from the cooler in Schatz without the omelette guy giving me a judgmental look? He’s been watching me binge this whole time.
Awkward and hungry, Secretly Hoarding A Mound of Eclairs, Fighting Urge to Loosen belt
Dear SHAMEFUL,
Well, what were you doing in Schatz, anyway? No one ever eats there after their first year — oh, wait, you’re a first-year? Okay, perfectly acceptable. Sorry for jumping to conclusions.
It’s not like the ice cream you’re eating is any worse for you than those balls of grease the omelette guy serves up, so you don’t have to feel bad about the actual eating. As far as his glaring goes, look him straight in the eye and chew your ice cream slowly and satisfyingly; he’ll just be jealous.
Or just get your ice cream at Dave & Andy’s,
Evan Kahn

They always said the Devil would be attractive. They just never said he’d be the guy who sang “Get Lucky.”
These words must certainly have passed through Robin Thicke’s mind a few times in the last year. The R&B crooner’s career suddenly exploded in March 2013 with the release of “Blurred Lines,” an I-just-can’t-help-myself-no-matter-how-hard-I-try catchy ode to womanizing that Thicke, according to album credits, co-wrote with Pharrell Williams. The song, as we know all too well, went on to become the “song of the summer.”
But the Devil was lurking in the shadows, and as “Blurred Lines” shot to the top of the charts, Thicke saw his life disintegrate in the afterburn.
Controversy surrounding the song’s misogynistic and rape-condoning lyrical content, as well as the infamous NSFW music video, made Thicke a token in conversations about sexual assault.
A performance at the VMAs with Miley Cyrus — the twerk heard ‘round the world — put him at the center of a cultural firestorm involving sexual exploitation of teens, misguided racial appropriation, and bad music.
A widely circulated photograph of Thicke placing his hand on a model’s rear end at a VMAs after-party was followed by an announcement of his divorce from wife Paula Patton, whom he’d been with since the two were teenagers.
His latest album, released in July and titled Paula, is a 14-track (15 if you count the Afrojack remix) plea to his ex-wife to take him back. She has not, and the album flopped. In its first week of release in the UK, Paula moved 530 copies — in Australia, 54.
And now, due to an ongoing lawsuit over whether “Blurred Lines” plagiarized soul superstar Marvin Gaye’s 1977 hit “Got To Give It Up,” a new element in the breaking of Robin Thicke has been revealed through recently released court deposition papers: He didn’t actually write the song that catapulted him to the upper echelon of fame and then snapped him like Matzah.
In fact, he arrived late to the studio and the song was already “80% finished.” In fact, he was too high to be of any help in the studio, save provide vocals. In fact, he’s been high pretty much all the time for the past year, especially in interviews where he vigorously defended his art against detractors who accused him of perpetuating rape culture in America.
The admissions Thicke made in that court deposition — no doubt made to try to clear himself of any wrongdoing in this copyright suit — cast Thicke’s greatest year in a whole new light. Whereas before Thicke’s story was the downfall of a man who tried to appeal to our basest instincts with primitive lyrics tied to a catchy beat and received the due backlash, it now looks more like Willy Loman’s: the story of a desperate man who just wanted people to like him.
Thicke was desperate enough for fame that he signed in blood on the dotted line and just didn’t expect how much would be asked in return.
Before “Blurred Lines,” the average American’s opinion on Thicke and his gorgeous baby blues was, at best, total apathy. And while Thicke’s career may not have been the most successful in music, it was certainly one to be proud of.
His music career began before he was even out of high school. Thicke formed a vocal group (boy band), As One, and asked his father — television actor Alan Thicke, or “the dad from Growing Pains” — if he could have some money for a professional demo. Alan, accustomed to dispensing sagely fatherly advice to a blossoming Leonardo DiCaprio, told his son that he’d have to finish high school before following his dreams of singing smooth songs of seduction and heartbreak.
Like all determined kids, Thicke got what he wanted regardless. After securing the money from a friend’s uncle, he recorded the four-song demo, which eventually found its way into the lap of producer and R&B singer Brian McKnight, with whom Thicke would co-write the 1995 hit “Anyway,” off McKnight’s second album. From there, the 17-year-old Thicke began making a name for himself as an industry-man: producing and writing songs for artists.
With the new millennium came new aspirations, and Thicke began working on his own album. 2002 saw the release of his debut single, “When I Get You Alone.” The music video depicts a younger, simpler Thicke, gleefully riding a bicycle through the streets of Manhattan, his wild and untamed hair flowing free as he rhythmically bounces on the handlebars like an overexcited child.
The years 2003 through 2011 would see Thicke release a total of five albums, all of them written and produced by Thicke himself. That kind of output — especially for a pop and R&B singer — is pretty impressive, and while Thicke’s singles never made a huge pop-culture splash, they still sold well. But it just wasn’t enough.
Fast forward to 2013, as Thicke began work on his sixth album. He had a studio session booked with superstar producer Pharrell Williams, who was behind pop staples “I’m a Slave 4 U,” “Hot in Herre,” and many more.
In the story he told in 2013, Thicke strolled into the studio humming the Marvin Gaye tune “Got To Give It Up,” and suggested the two try to write a song that had a similar groove and style. They bounced ideas around the room, began catcalling to each other and thought it was funny so they threw their creepy “I know you want it”s into the song, and finally walked out with “Blurred Lines.”
But now we know how it actually went down.
Running (very) late, Thicke arrived at the studio bombed out of his gourd on Vicodin and alcohol, ready to sit down with Williams and write a song. Except Williams was pretty much done already and, seeing as Thicke was likely useless given that chemical cocktail, told the man to get in the booth and sing the words he’d written.
Once it was completed and they were listening to it, Thicke surely must have made the realization that he, at last, had a bona fide hit on his hands, and that he’d had absolutely nothing to do with it. Five albums and 18 years of writing and producing songs, giving it his absolute all, and his first smash would have happened with or without him. It must’ve felt like proof that nothing he ever composed himself would be good enough; that he, frankly, wasn’t superstar material. Even with the inflated ego granted by a water bottle of vodka, that must’ve cut deep.
On that day, Thicke picked up the pen and held it in his hand, the flaming contract in front of him. But it wasn’t until he sat down with music video director Diane Martel that he unwittingly sealed his own doom.
Martel got her start directing videos for 1990s New York hip-hop acts such as Lords of the Underground and Method Man. She also helmed many of Mariah Carey’s early videos, shepherding Carey’s transformation from innocent songstress to sexy pop diva.
Thicke asked for a “white cyc” video — meaning all the action is filmed against a blank background — and Martel factored that into her vision: “to make videos that sell records … not to make videos that express my own obsessions, but to make videos that move units.” What better way to move units than simply put a bunch of naked models on the screen, make a porno and call it “NSFW,” and release it into the Internet? From a marketing standpoint, I’d say it’s uninspired, but certainly effective.
Thicke reported that he had his doubts about the video, but declared in an interview that he decided  “Hey … let’s go for it …’cause for me, nudity is the least offensive thing in the world.” And just like a hopeless middle schooler who finally gets a chance to stay out late with the cool kids, he asked for permission from the necessary authority ­— he claimed his wife allowed him to go through with the idea – and must have begun excitedly pondering the heights to which this song would take him.
And like Faust, Thicke briefly saw all of his dreams come true. “Blurred Lines” ripped a hole in the cultural continuum, becoming a fact of life for just about anyone who existed within earshot of a speaker. But not everyone was singing along.
Women everywhere began commenting on the song’s lyrical message. Lisa Huynh wrote in a post on her “feminist in LA” blog in April 2013 that “the majority of the song has the R&B singer murmuring ‘I know you want it’ over and over into a girl’s ear. Call me a cynic, but that phrase does not exactly encompass the notion of consent in sexual activity.”
In September 2013, Project Unbreakable, a photographic project dedicated to rape survivors, held up placards comparing words spoken by their attackers to lines from the song. In November 2013, the student union of University College London officially banned the song from play, joining another 20 student unions in the UK who’d already done so. A July 2014 “#AskThicke” twitter stunt resulted in the singer’s feed being flooded with comments relating to the song’s controversy, including such gems as “When you’re not busy objectifying women, making light of rape and justifying sexual violence, how do you like to relax?” and “The world my kids will grow up in is less safe because of Blurred Lines. How can you fix that?”
Thicke could’ve shielded himself from some of the blowback by admitting the truth: that he didn’t actually write the song. But in interviews — interviews we now know he’d prepared for by downing a water bottle of vodka and a couple of prescription painkillers — he constantly held to his original story that a) he helped write it and b) the plan was for it to sound somewhat similar to “Got To Give It Up” the entire time. Why did Thicke do this? The reason is actually pretty understandable:
“I always prided myself on the fact that I wrote and produced my first six albums myself … Once [Blurred Lines] became successful, I felt like I wanted to have some of the credit for the other six albums worth of work that I had done.”
Williams wrote the song, but because it was Thicke’s face and voice all over it, Thicke got the blame.
Thicke vehemently defended the song in interviews by saying that everyone needed to lighten up and not take the song so seriously. His appearance on the Today Show now appears particularly sad. When asked how he felt about having the hit of the summer, Thicke responded, “Dreams really do come true. If you stay committed and keep trying, your dreams do come true.” As long as they’re the dreams of someone who knows how to dream for a mass audience.
At the end of the interview, Thicke broke into a performance of his song “Take It Easy On Me,” which he prefaced with a request that the world do the same to him. 
Come on guys, I didn’t even write it. No one seemed to care when I was pouring my heart into my work. Now that I’ve given you what you want, please just let me have my moment in the sun.
During his performance later that year at the VMAs, Miley Cyrus gyrated against his pelvis and everyone thought, “Gross. Isn’t that guy almost old enough to be her father?” For a man who had sparked a national discussion of sexual misconduct, dancing suggestively with a teen on national television certainly was a misstep. But once again, it’s hardly likely the performance was Thicke’s idea at all.
Given the way telecast awards shows are run — especially ones on the ever image-conscious MTV — it’s much more plausible that show producers devised the entire thing and Thicke was once again simply given instructions. But it was Thicke’s pelvis on screen, and thus Thicke once again got the blame.
Shortly after the VMAs, the infamous picture of Thicke grabbing model Lana Scolaro at an after-party surfaced. In February 2014, Paula Patton and Thicke announced their “mutual” separation.
In July 2014, Thicke released an album that he hoped would win back his ex-wife. Titled Paula, the record sports such hopefully sad song titles as “Get Her Back,” “Love Can Grow Back,” and “Too Little Too Late.” The album was a failure in all categories: Paula did not take him back, and the album completely bombed.
So now, what does Robin Thicke have left? His career will likely never recover from the damage wrought by “Blurred Lines,” his marriage to a woman he’d been with since they were 14 years old lies in a million little pieces on his bathroom floor, Marvin Gaye’s family is still suing him over the song he didn’t write, and everyone thinks the words “sexual assault” when they hear his name. At least he’s sober:
“I’ve been sober for the last two months. When your wife leaves you, it gives you good reason to sober up … I’ve actually only been sober off the … Vicodin. I still drink.”
Well, at least he’s off the pills.
So now, about a year and a half after “Blurred Lines” was unleashed upon the world, Thicke has lost just about everything he’d spent so many years building. He sold his soul for a shot at fame, allowed himself to be handled like a monkey, and will now only remain relevant as long as using his name as the butt of a crass joke is still funny.
Damn you Devil, why couldn’t you let this one go?

22 Jump Street
If you are like me and have had enough of Jonah Hill for the next ten years from watching The Wolf of Wall Street, but could stare at Channing Tatum’s jawline for hours, then you will probably like 22 Jump Street. The Hill-Tatum pairing is very well balanced (hence the sequel). But this time they aren’t going back to high school. No, sir, they are moving on up to college (just like us!). The studious, detail-oriented Schmidt (Hill) and athletic, idiotic Jenko (Tatum) are once again assigned to a case that involves them going undercover to arrest the drug dealer of a new drug called WHYPHY. Though very similar to 21 Jump Street in structure, the writers were aware of this and made fun of themselves as much as they could. This sequel, while eccentric at times, gives a spirited take on the cop movie.
Chef
Have you ever seen a movie starring food? Me neither, unless you count Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and its sequel. So let me introduce you to Chef, a lighthearted chronicle of cook Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) moving from the cutthroat world of high-end cookery to the gritty world of food trucks. Jon Favreau steps out from behind the camera and takes a stab at being the leading man. The supporting cast is nothing to scoff at, with Hollywood heavy-hitters like Dustin Hoffman, Robert Downey Jr., and Scarlett Johansson. This is the classic story of man getting fired from highbrow job, man starting own company, and man’s company becoming successful. All that needed to happen next was “man gets own Food Network show.”

Got your study groove down and just need a playlist to match it? Feeling reminiscent? If you were born in the ‘90s, this 10-song playlist will bring you back to your childhood and the awkward phase of turn-of-the-millennium music videos.
Steal My Sunshine 1999
Featured on Len’s third album, You Can’t Stop the Bum Rush, “Steal My Sunshine” is a mesmerizing tune. It’s calm enough to put you to sleep, but not because it’s boring. The song samples “More More More” by the Andrea True Connection, slowing down the original tune until it bops along at a head bobbing pace. The song is sure to bring you back to the beach and summer, even as the leaves turn colors on the Cut.
The music video seems like the final product of someone learning how to use slideshow transitions for the first time. And don’t forget to watch the clearly out-of-sync lipsyncing.
The Anthem 2003
Remember when you were a rebellious teenager? Remember when everyone around you thought it was cool to dress in entirely black clothes and chains? Good Charlotte’s “The Anthem,” from The Young and the Hopeless (cheerful title for an album, huh?) is a reminder of just how unique and rebellious you are. The song empowers listeners to be individuals who won’t take advice from anyone with its in-your-face vocals by lead vocalist Joel Madden. Despite the song’s drab outlook, you won’t be able to get it out of your head, and you’ll probably find yourself listening to it more than once in a row.
Want to learn how to look tough popping wheelies on a bike or flashing the peace sign? This music video’s for you.
Blue (Da Ba Dee) 1999
This is the song that literally turned us all blue and made no sense, but we sang along anyway. Recorded by Eiffel 65 for their debut album Europop, the song repeats the word “blue” 36 times and requires very little practice to master its chorus (“I’m blue, da ba dee da ba di”). Try matching the autotuned voices with your own un-autotuned voice though. Bet you can’t. Don’t watch the music video. Seriously.; it’s terrible.
Hey Ya! 2003
OutKast: “Shake it like a Polaroid picture!” ‘Nuff said.
Hollaback Girl 2005
“This s*** is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S.” Gwen Stefani is probably the only artist who can claim she got almost every high school cheerleader in America and their friends to scream out the name of a fruit like it was the coolest thing since Nintendo released the N64. Listen to this song for the rare times when you miss high school and having a full turnout at football games.
The music video is exactly what you’d expect —Gwen asserting herself as a tough cheerleader leading a marching band, because what else would you expect from a song overrun by piercing whistles and high school marching band instrument solos?
Stacy’s Mom 2003
Just like Stacy’s mom, this song has got it going on. Fountains of Wayne clearly doesn’t take itself seriously with this song, which is on their album Welcome Interstate Managers. If for some reason you don’t already know it, this song is about a boy and his fantasies with his friend Stacy’s mom, as he fawns over their every interaction. There’s no meaning behind it beyond that, so don’t go looking for any.
The music video? A pubescent teen getting flustered by an older woman.
1985 2004
From Bowling For Soup’s A Hangover You Don’t Deserve, “1985” is a catchy little tune that took the world by storm in 2004. Filled with cultural references galore (“Bruce Springsteen, Madonna/Way before Nirvana/There was U2 and Blondie/And music still on MTV”), the song caters to both a younger audience with its punk rock style and an older audience of parents who can’t help but be reminded of why their music growing up was so much better than the music produced today.
Oops!... I Did It Again 2000
Probably the most iconic Britney Spears song ever, “Oops!... I Did It Again” appeared on the artist’s second album of the same name and contains a pretty conspicuous reference to James Cameron’s 1997 Titanic film. You could honestly swap this song with any one of Spears’ earlier hits and maintain the quality of this stellar throwback playlist.
Watch the music video to see Britney seduce an astronaut in space and then leave him in the dust.
How You Remind Me 2001
Before you screech at the presence of a Nickelback song on this list, take a few minutes to listen to “How You Remind Me.” Also remember that Nickelback once put out music decent enough to make it onto top 100 lists and into car radios. That said, this song may only be good for a few listens before it becomes monotonous.It’s hard to listen to something over and over again if it has a slower pace and gruffer feel. The chorus is simple enough to learn, yet complex enough that you aren’t singing the same three or four words.
If you know what Nickelback’s lead singer looks like, then you know everything about this music video: Since it basically consists of closeups of Chad Kroeger and his long, wavy hair.
All Star 1999
You should probably put your fingers up in the shape of an L on your forehead if you don’t know every word to this Smash Mouth smash hit. The song is on Astro Lounge and also appeared as a lead soundtrack song in the first Shrek. Put this one on in the library, cluster, or wherever you are and see who belts out the song with you. Give shade to the haters and power your way through to the end if no one sings along.
Watch the first few seconds of the music video to see appearances by Ben Stiller and other guests in clips of cult classic Mystery Man mashed up with Smash Mouth vocals.

After the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a Title IX Complaint against Carnegie Mellon in December, the university became one of over 50 schools in the nation under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR). Last week, Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno sent an email to the student body detailing the university’s initiatives to combat sexual assault and sexual harassment.
Title IX is a section of the 1972 Education Amendments that prohibits gender discrimination in education. The university allegedly failed to protect “Gabrielle” — the pseudonym given to the victim in the ACLU’s complaint — from her abusive ex-girlfriend. Gabrielle dated her assailant for six months as a first-year student, until her “girlfriend became verbally and sexually abusive,” according to an ACLU blog post.
At the end of their relationship, Gabrielle’s ex-girlfriend continued to stalk, harass, and intimidate her. The university, the complaint says, allegedly failed to hear out Gabrielle’s complaints and properly deal with the situation.
The complaint came only about six months after Carnegie Mellon revised its Sexual Assault Policy in 2013 in the wake of the spring 2011 “Dear Colleague Letter,” an open letter published by the OCR that outlined the requirements of Title IX and steps that schools should take to comply with the law.
Also in 2013, the Violence against Women Act — commonly known as VAWA — was reauthorized by Congress. VAWA, originally enacted in 1994, provides federal funding for the investigation and persecution of violent crimes against women and established the Office on Violence against Women in the Department of Justice.
Under VAWA, universities are required to report domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking; adopt certain discipline procedures for students; and adopt certain institutional policies to prevent sexual violence on campus, according to the American Council on Education’s website.
“It was a call to codify some of those things and name them in the policy,” Casalegno said to The Tartan of the “Dear Colleague” letter, mentioning that it addressed many policies that the university had in place informally but had never before stated explicitly. “And there were new best practices and new guidelines to best protect the welfare of [the] campus community.”
Carnegie Mellon’s revised sexual assault policy went into effect in 2013. It includes roles for four deputy Title IX coordinators in addition to the existing one coordinator, and changed the definition of a “reasonably prompt” response to a complaint. The new policy also changed the evidentiary standard to “preponderance of the evidence,” the lowest burden of proof; changed the composition of the Committees of Investigation based on the status of complainant and respondent; and gave student members a right to vote in the committees.
The university is also planning to hire a director and assistant director of Title IX initiatives; the director will eventually succeed the Title IX coordinator and help define the role of the assistant director.
“The trend is that universities are moving to a single investigator model,” Casalegno said. “There are times that students are not interested in proceeding criminally, and [are] able to work with someone who, most of their job is to conduct these investigations, [and is] highly trained and sensitive to the issues with survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault.”
The sexual assault policy is only one part of the university’s continuing push for better sexual assault and harassment education and prevention. The Sexual Assault Advisory program, created in 1991 to train students, faculty, and staff in dealing with sexual assault and harassment on campus, has been revamped and renamed the Survivor Support Network (SSN).
Jessica Klein, hired about a year ago as the university’s coordinator of gender programs and sexual violence prevention, worked to shift the focus of the SSN on primary prevention. Primary prevention, Klein said, includes “education, bystander training, and effective policy,” and stands in contrast to secondary training, which is mostly “self-defense, like covering your drink when you go to a party.”
The SSN is an attempt to bring about a cultural shift at Carnegie Mellon. “I think that the Survivor Support Network teaches about rape culture, about how masculinity and gender roles really factor into violence in society, how we can be active bystanders,” Klein said. The SSN asks “How are we having conversations about these things, and not necessarily just being there for survivors, but building a community where this isn’t tolerated or accepted.”
Klein has also been working with student organizations to combat sexual assault and sexual harassment, including the Got Consent?, Campaign, an organization that recently became recognized by the university and aims to raise awareness around campus about how to prevent sexual assault and harassment.
Klein is also working with Undergraduate Student Senate. Sophomore economics major Vaasavi Unnava and junior decision science major Julia Eddy are in the process of forming a committee within Senate on sexual violence prevention at Carnegie Mellon.
Unnava and Eddy highlighted a national federal initiative, It’s On Us, which began on Friday. The campaign, Eddy said, involves over a hundred colleges and universities, and includes public relations materials “like online materials, poster you can print out — all kinds of stuff — and a pledge that you can take.”
It’s On Us, according to its website, is working to prevent sexual assault by reminding students that “It’s on us” to prevent sexual violence.
“A big part of the entire thing is that legislatively, there’s only so much you can do about sexual assault,” Unnava said. “It’s one thing to make rules, but it’s another thing to change the culture around them.”
Unnava and Eddy also plan to work with the Got Consent? Campaign and lead initiatives like “round table discussions, especially involving fraternities,” and a day of volunteering at a rape crisis center, Eddy said.
Unnava said that the university has made the necessary policy changes, and all that’s left is a change in campus culture. Part of the ongoing effort to change this culture includes changes to the university’s Orientation program.
Orientation this year included Decisions That Matter, a 90-minute session on sexual assault prevention that “addressed dating violence, personal values, and interpersonal relationships, and how that ties into building a better community,” Klein said.
“Personally what I think is important is that even though it’s a little less fun, they’re not treating sexual assault as a joke,” Unnava said of the session. “They’re more serious with the skits, [and] having Haven makes people more aware of the idea of consent, and that stereotypes and prejudices and all that sorts of stuff exists.”
This does mean, Klein acknowledged, that there will be no more Condom Man, who, dressed as a superhero, handed out condoms to students in previous Orientation programs.
Haven is an online program adopted by the university last year. The program, created by EverFi, the same company that made AlcoholEdu, teaches incoming first-year students about what sexual assault is and how to prevent it.
“Some of the main things we’re looking for are definitions; that’s a big thing,” Lauren Aikin-Smith, a health promotion specialist for University Health Services, said about the content of Haven. “It’s interactive, so people can kind of see a situation happen, and then reflect on the situation they just saw, or they just read.”
“One of the good things about Haven and AlcoholEdu is that there’s general information, but then you can put in Carnegie Mellon sexual assault policy in the program,” Aikin-Smith said.
Aikin-Smith also works with the Peer Health Advocates (PHAs), who are students that work for University Health Services and run programs to educate students about safe sex and sexual assault prevention.
Aikin-Smith also talked about Decisions That Matter, a booklet published by the university — available online and given to all first-year students — that provides definitions of sexual assault and other key terms from the perspective of both Carnegie Mellon policy and Pennsylvania state law. The booklet gives a quick overview of Carnegie Mellon’s sexual assault and sexual harassment policies, and is meant to act as a reference guide for students.
Last week, The Tartan received a letter to the Editor signed by over thirty Carnegie Mellon students and alumni that are members of an online group called Tartans for Title IX. They write that “We find it very troubling, however, that a document about sexual violence called ‘Decisions that Matter’ seems more focused on a victim’s decisions leading up to an assault than it does on telling students to make the decision not to rape someone.”
“More disturbingly, when you tell a woman that she must restrict her behavior in order to avoid being raped, what you’re really saying is that a woman should ensure that a rapist goes after someone else—and how does that help to make Carnegie Mellon an ultimately safer community?” the letter continues.
“I think there were some very technical pieces of guidance and, actually now it’s in the law… of pieces that we have to have in this brochure,” Casalegno said of the letter’s complaints, noting that there’s a contrast between Carnegie Mellon’s campus policies and Pennsylvania state law surrounding sexual assault and sexual harassment, both of which are required to be in the pamphlet by VAWA and the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination (SaVE) Act, which was passed in 2013 and complements Title IX by requiring that universities are transparent and accountable in cases of sexual assault, according to its website.
“It’s a tough jump from our policy language, which is very rooted in our culture, to the state laws,” Casalegno said.
“I think that [we should do] anything we can to add to this brochure that helps people recognize that the decisions of all of us matter,” Casalegno said. “The decisions of bystanders matter tremendously. The decisions of survivors and how they want to seek support and resources and redress under our policies and our expectations on campus, they matter. The decisions of people who are making decisions not consistent with our policy, they matter.”
Casalegno stressed that she welcomed the input from students. “I will say that we can only get better if students are engaged in that dialogue, and I think that’s tremendous,” Casalegno said. “And I welcome anyone on campus with ideas of what we can be doing more of, what we can be doing differently, to absolutely speak up and come forward.”

After being crowned Miss Pennsylvania 2014, junior musical theatre major Amanda Fallon Smith competed at the national Miss America Pageant in Atlantic City, N.J. last Sunday. 
Although Miss New York, Kira Kazantsev, won the pageant overall, Smith won the talent portion of the preliminary competitions and has a platform of “Fitness and Nutrition: The Key to Healthy Living.”
“The Miss America pageant is something I’ve literally dreamed about since I was eight years old,” Smith told The Tartan, describing “the joy of competing and being able to walk on that stage.”
“I don’t take this opportunity for granted,” she added.
Smith won the Miss Pennsylvania pageant after participating in the competition for the first time, performing “Music of the Night” from The Phantom of the Opera.
Smith is taking a year off from studying at Carnegie Mellon to fulfill her duties as Miss Pennsylvania, which she described as traveling throughout the state to participate in community service events and various public appearances. 
Smith emphasized the role of her community work, saying the job is “much more” than simply attending parades.
Smith will be traveling to schools within the state and teaching children the importance of proper nutrition, a topic which she says is often overlooked.
“It’s kind of cliché, but children are the future,” Smith said. “This is the first generation which is not expected to outlive their parents.”
“Kids are just so receptive,” she said, speaking of her work. Smith eventually wants to expand her community service-related initiatives to nutrition education for families, where she acknowledges that “the major problem with nutrition is that it’s so expensive.” She aims to help develop “healthy, affordable plans for families,” but “right now, I’m really focusing on the school system.”
Smith said that her Carnegie Mellon musical theatre training was helpful in pageant competitions and added that without it, “honestly I don’t know if I would have had the confidence.”
Smith intends to pursue a career related to her musical theatre training, either on stage in New York or on screen in Los Angeles.
After this year, Smith wishes to continue her outreach work related to nutrition, saying “to do the service I want to do, I don’t need a crown on my head.”
She spoke highly of the work of the Children’s Miracle Network, which is the competition’s national platform partner, and encouraged members of the campus community to volunteer at Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh downtown. The Children’s Miracle Network is a nonprofit organization that raises money for children’s hospitals.

Andrew W. Moore, former vice president of engineering at Google, became the new dean of Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science (SCS) in August. Moore has roots at Carnegie Mellon — he was a professor of computer science and robotics before he joined Google in 2006.
Moore helped found Google’s Pittsburgh office, which was once part of Carnegie Mellon’s Robert Mehrabian Collaborative Innovation Center (CIC). When Google outgrew the CIC, however, Google moved to its current location in Bakery Square, where it has been since 2010. 
Moore succeeds former dean Randal Bryant, who stepped down to return to be part of the SCS faculty on June 30, after serving as dean of SCS since 2004.
Moore views his position as an administrative role, with an eye to some laudable goals. 
“We’re one of the few places in the world that are making the next technology leaders, and, across campus, we are doing these amazing things,” Moore said. “My high-level meta-goal is producing these technology leaders and promoting research.”
With this in mind, Moore is brainstorming ways to achieve these goals. One thing that he is focusing on is removing obstacles for faculty members here at Carnegie Mellon.
“If you’re a faculty member at any university, life is very exciting. There are things you want to build,” Moore said. 
But Moore says writing proposals and getting grants can be stressful. Moore hopes to find ways to alleviate these worries. That way faculty can focus on their research, rather than having to deal with bureaucracy.
This does, however, mean that Moore doesn’t get much time to pursue his own research in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and robotics. 
“That’s my dream, that some day I can get back to doing some research, but I don’t see that happening for a year or two,” Moore said, noting that there are many exciting possibilities for Carnegie Mellon right now, and that his work as dean will work to further the university’s role as a leader in technology.
Having moved from industry to academia, Moore is in the perfect position to compare industry and university life. “Interestingly, I feel that being at Google is fairly similar to Carnegie Mellon. At first sight, it sounds like they are completely different places; one is about education and blue sky research, and the other about making products that the world’s population uses. 
But when you look at what people are really doing, at both places you have scrawling on whiteboards [and] grabbing the whiteboard marker out of each other’s hands as they’re trying to write their ideas down. In both cases you have work that people are very passionate about,” Moore said.
Moore also acknowledges the differences between academic life and life in industry. “Maybe the single most important thing that we’re doing at Carnegie Mellon is education. While there’s a lot of educating at Google, it’s very different from that in a university.”

When scanning the benches at Carnegie Mellon’s next home football game on Sept. 27, you may see a Tartan jersey just a bit smaller than the others.
This jersey belongs to Brock Kitterman, a 9-year-old boy proud to be the latest addition to the football team. Kitterman is different than the others on the field for reasons besides his 4-foot-6 frame; Kitterman suffers from bilateral retinoblastoma, a very rare eye cancer. 
When he was just 12 weeks old, Kitterman underwent chemotherapy for six months to calcify the tumors. Though the tumors shrank, allowing his retinas to reattach, the treatment significantly compromised his hearing. Brock is considered legally blind and deaf.
Kitterman became involved in the Carnegie Mellon football program as part of Team IMPACT (Inpsire, Motivate, and Play Against Challenges Together), an organization that matches college sports teams with children battling chronic illnesses.
Kitterman’s past medical problems still have an effect on him today. Largely deprived of his sight and hearing, Brock struggled socially, finding it challening to pick up on social cues, even those as simple as a smile. His mother, Tammy Kitterman, noticed this problem and mentioned it to a doctor at Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.
After a few weeks, the doctor suggested joining Team IMPACT. Tammy signed Brock up for the program and he was matched up with the Tartans.
“When we first heard Brock would be matched with the football team, we were extremely apprehensive,” Tammy Kitterman said, “but after meeting the guys, we all agreed it couldn’t have been a better team.”
Head Coach Rich Lackner was approached by Director of Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation Joshua Centor about “adopting” Brock, and was enthusiastic about the idea from the start.
“Brock is an honor and an opportunity to impact the football program at Carnegie Mellon,” Lackner said.
According to Tammy Kitterman Brock now attends several practices each week, prepares the locker room for games, and supports the Tartans at every game. When the team is on the field playing or practicing, the team managers play a “crucial role” on the sidelines, keeping Brock involved and busy during the game.
Brock was unanimously voted captain for this fall season.
“Brock truly brings a unique perspective on life,” Lackner said. “When you look at the challenges he faces every day, it makes your own problems seem insignificant.”
Senior mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering double major Dustin Schneider said he is constantly inspired by Brock. “When you’re having a tough day or rough practice, it helps to think of Brock’s bravery,” Schneider said. “He’s just really fun to be around.”
Both Lackner and Schneider commented that Brock has helped create an even stronger team dynamic. “Brock serves as a daily reminder that we are incredibly blessed to be playing college football,” Schneider said. 
Although he cannot play football, instead cheering the Tartans on from the bleachers, Brock remains active in other sports. This past summer Brock completed a triathlon. A number of Carnegie Mellon football players went out to watch him compete.
“I am absolutely amazed at Brock on a daily basis,” Lackner said. “He never stops pushing himself.”
After his first-place finish in the triathlon, Brock was treated by the football players to a trip to Kennywood amusement park.
“It really showed how trusting [Brock’s parents] were with our football players,” Lackner said. “After just meeting the players weeks earlier, they felt confident their son was in good hands.”
Brock’s mother has seen Brock grow significantly since the start of the program. She, as well as Coach Lackner and the players, have all noticed remarkable improvement in Brock’s social skills. “He has opened up a lot more and gained a lot of self-confidence,” Tammy Kitterman said. “He really considers the football guys to be his closest friends.”
Carnegie Mellon’s basketball team is currently in the process of “adopting” as well; their prospective adoptee is a 5-year-old boy who has acute lymphoblastic leukemia. “Our hope and expectation is that he will be having such a great time with us that ... CMU basketball will be front and center in his thoughts day in and day out, rather than his daily chemotherapy treatments or frequent hospital visits,” said junior business administration major and forward for Carnegie Mellon’s basketball team Kevin Stursberg. “The kid is a warrior!”

Mainstream media seems to have a pretty good idea of what constitutes a “good role model” and who fits the bill. Case in point: The Internet went into uproar last week when rap superstar Nicki Minaj tweeted indignantly about Fiorello H. LaGuardia Arts High School’s refusal to let her return to “the school that changed [her] life” and “inspire” students. Since Minaj and I share an alma mater, needless to say I was shocked to hear that the new principal Lisa Mars declined the visitation offer of one of our school’s all-time most successful graduates. 
Speculation flew wildly about the reasoning behind the snub, and I’ll admit that I bought into Minaj’s insinuation that it was because the principal didn’t consider her “good enough.” In terms of music video views or albums sold, no doubt Minaj’s celebrity sufficed; but as a “role model,” LaGuardia’s principal would surely be neither the first nor last to believe Nicki Minaj not good enough.
In later reports, the principal defended herself, claiming that it was the New York Department of Education’s objections, and not her own, which barred Minaj from LaGuardia’s doors. Minaj wanted to bring MTV cameras onto New York City public school grounds with about a week’s notice, and couldn’t compromise her busy schedule for a date more acceptable to the bureaucracy. In a nuanced light, Minaj’s righteous anger seems a bit overplayed. Nevertheless, this apparent misunderstanding of a scandal provides a convenient platform to talk about the anatomy of the female role model.
There are many reasons one might have for not wanting their daughter or little sister to look up to Nicki Minaj. Nine out of 10 of these reasons probably have to do with her notoriously shameless expression of sexuality. Minaj is known for her killer curves as much as she is for her killer verses, neither of which she is afraid to flaunt. Her chart-topping summer single “Anaconda,” which has amassed over 184 million plays on YouTube, features a rhythmic chorus and Minaj as the unchallenged twerking master; it’s difficult to say which is more mesmerizing.
The same folks shaking their heads at Minaj for such a lascivious display will surely fail to consider the music video’s scene where she gleefully chops up a banana and then sneers at the phallic remains. They will also likely not acknowledge the fact that the one time a man is present in the video, he is overwhelmed by Minaj’s seductive powers, and when he tries to touch her without her consent, she immediately shoves him away and struts off the screen, abandoning him with head in hands. Minaj’s sexiness is self-aware and unashamed, and everything she allows us to see is entirely within her control.
Society has a way of demonizing women — and especially female celebrities — who own their sexuality like Minaj does. To be sexy is to be “slutty,” and to be slutty is to be morally decrepit and corrupting. The only way women’s sexuality may be halfway acceptable is when it is tempered by the presence of a man, whether he is rapping about his “big booty hoes” or grabbing at the scantily-clad bodies of the anonymous women surrounding him. When a woman like Minaj — or Miley Cyrus, or Kesha, or even Beyoncé — dares to be sexual, independent of a man’s influence, society is thrown through a loop and quick to enact brutal judgment.
Maybe my high school’s refusal of Nicki Minaj had nothing to do with the lurid reputation society has given her. Still, there is no better time than now to speak up in defense of women like Minaj, who embrace their sexuality and who are role models despite and because of that. It might be worth noting that Minaj, Cyrus, Kesha, and Beyoncé have all self-identified as feminists, while such “good girl” celebrities as Shailene Woodley and Katy Perry have swerved away from the label as if dodging an oncoming truck. 
Minaj is a talented artist who revolutionized rap music. She is a driven businesswoman who has built, grown, and maintained an immensely successful career, noting that the same qualities that make her a “bitch” would make a “boss” out of a man. And, yes, Nicki Minaj is sexy. I am proud to call her a role model of mine.

Thinking about buying one of those shiny new iPhone 6s or iPhone 6 Pluses? Don’t hesitate much longer — they’re that worth it.
Apple launched its next generation iPhones (yes, two new models) on Sept. 19, opening its Shadyside location at 8 a.m. to an enormous crowd around its front doors.
As the owner of an iPhone 6 Plus, I can safely say that the new phones are bigger, better, and true workhorses compared to the iPhone’s earlier high-end model, the iPhone 5S.
I’ll spend most of this review talking about screen real estate because, let’s be real, that’s the biggest hardware change for the latest models.
Put simply, the screens are gigantic. If you can’t stand big phones, don’t even consider the Plus model. The smaller iPhone 6 touts a 4.7-inch screen, while the larger iPhone 6 Plus is fitted with a 5.5-inch screen. When put in terms of a phone screen, that’s a lot of new real estate, and space that Apple uses to its advantage well.
While I was only able to test the iPhone 6 for a few minutes on launch day, I’ve been using the iPhone 6 Plus for a few days now. The Plus has an option to turn the home screen sideways, and certain Apple-native apps offer more functionality in this orientation. Although nothing new is revealed by turning the phone sideways on the home screen, there are new options in other apps, like the ability to see all your emails or iMessages in a list next to the one you have selected.
When you double tap the home screen, you also see a list of recent contacts above the apps you have running at the moment, and the company has instituted one of its simplest, yet most intuitive features, “reachability”, to account for the screen space. Tap, but don’t press, the iPhone’s Touch ID sensor to bring the stuff at the top of your screen down to thumb’s reach if you’re using the phone with one hand. This feature makes using such a big screen effortless.
Besides maybe not being able to fit the new phones in your pocket, you won’t have any trouble actually using the larger screens. The phones’ new rounded edges and thinness also make the models easy to slide in and out of larger pockets. Going back to my iPhone 5’s screen after using the new big screen made me wonder why I didn’t switch to a bigger phone before this Apple launch.
All that said, these phones should have come out years ago when Google and Samsung released their first big-screen Galaxy phones. It’s nice to have Apple software running on a bigger screen that’s not as big as the iPad Air or Mini, but Apple had no excuse not to churn these phones out instead of the iPhone 5 or 5S when they were released, beyond not wanting to deal with the pain of switching up app sizes. 
Despite this gripe, the phones feel better in the hand and, on my first day of heavy use, I only drained the battery of the Plus to 40 percent. And, of course, there’s iOS8, which comes with its own slew of fun features, like the ability to send voice clips over text, download third-party keyboards (hello, SwiftKey), and track your health with HealthKit.
For those enamored by Apple’s ecosystem, now’s the time to buy.

Imagine not having to leave your room to attend class. Instead, your morning routine consists of climbing out of bed and turning on your MacBook. Video feeds of the professor and eight other students appear. After introductions, your professor asks a question about the reading.
Instead of waiting for a student to raise their hand, the professor asks each of you to complete a poll that will test your understanding of the assigned reading. Your answers are then displayed so that you can be called on to defend them. In this situation, you do not have a choice in answering, and, more importantly, you are kept on your toes. This is an example of a class at the Minerva Project.
Minerva is an accredited university with administrative offices and a dorm in San Francisco. According to Ben Nelson, its entrepreneur and founder, and Stephen M. Kosslyn, the cognitive neuroscientist and former Harvard dean with whom Nelson has collaborated, this class setting is the future of higher education. Their goal is to replace the long-established college lecture with a virtual system of learning. What does this mean to the students currently attending college and sitting through lectures?
Kosslyn states that traditional lectures are cost-effective but pedagogically unsound. According to him, Minerva has an advantage over traditional universities in its incorporation of what his research has identified as the best educational practices. 
He claims that forcing students to guess the answer to a problem and to discuss their thoughts with others, enables them to learn more, even if their guesses are incorrect.
Many of the points Nelson and Kosslyn make are true. There are such things as pointless lectures. Lectures become pointless when students choose not to participate and refuse to actually learn. Large university lectures are opportunities either for students to hide in the back and not participate or to actively learn from a professor who is an expert in the lecture’s subject.
However, Nelson and Kosslyn do not seriously consider the sacrifices that need to be made in order for traditional universities to follow Minerva’s example. Nelson claims that Minerva is an attempt to strip the traditional university down to its essence without lectures or tenure, just learning.
What about life outside of the lecture hall? College is about learning from the experts, but also learning about oneself. More often than not, we learn about ourselves through the people we meet and the places we go. Minerva is attempting to increase the value of its college experience by opening up more campuses around the world. This will definitely be a plus to all of those attending Minerva. However, there is still a distance between students and faculty inherent to Minerva’s online platform.
There is a critical social aspect to college that is lost as a result of education models like Minerva. There is something about letting students participate in on-campus organizations that brings people and ideas together. Look around Carnegie Mellon’s campus. As I write this, there are countless students communicating and collaborating to make a difference in their communities. The accessibility of professors encourages students to seek help when needed. However, if professors were only available through Skype, the easily accessible relationship between student and instructor would decline. It is the daily interactions students have both in and outside of class that let us truly value the college experience.
Minerva is a great example of how education could be improved. There is a definite benefit to applying pressure to students to participate in small groups. Minerva’s online platform does keep students attentive and forces them to learn. However, a lot of learning is up to the student. 
Minerva strips away not only the college experience of lectures but also the opportunity to communicate and find one’s passions through social interactions. Activities fairs, where students proudly display what they have been doing outside of the class to make a difference and encourage others to share their ideas, are a great example of what the college experience is comprised of. If these interactions were not available, the concept of the college experience would decline.

Last week, Scotland put practical concerns over national pride and voted to remain part of the United Kingdom. 
Fifty-five percent of Scottish voters opted to remain part of the UK after with an 85 percent voter turnout, Scottish voters made the wise choice of electing to remain part of a mutually beneficial political and economic union. 
The desire for Scottish independence is more than understandable; Scots have a culture, accent, and history that is distinct from England. The Scottish parliament has also pursued a much more liberal agenda than the English parliament; has not taken the austerity measures the rest of the United Kingdom has; and still offers free university tuition to all students. 
Many Scots also rallied behind the ideas of removing British nuclear  submarines from bases on the Scottish coast and less involvement in unpopular military action in the Middle East.
These compelling political and social motivations moved 45 percent of voters to support separation, but they did not trump economic concerns. 
On average, Scotland has a lower life expectancy, and its significantly higher than average weekly pay for full-time workers is dependent on  oil and gas revenues, according to the BBC (which has been accused of bias by many independence supporters). Scotland has numerous health and social burdens, which would place a great deal of stress on the finances of a social democracy, the likely model to be adopted by an independent Scottish state. Scotland would have difficulty facing these problems without the  financial support of the  United Kingdom’s economy and financial institutions.
While Scotland’s oil provides a potentially major source of revenue for a newly independent nation, reliance on a single source of fossil fuels is not a financially sound or sustainable solution. Betting a nation’s revenue stream on a single commodity is a dangerous move, especially in the current climate of growing calls for the reduction of fossil fuel use and backlash against their impact. 
On top of these concerns, the Royal Bank of Scotland decided that, were Scotland to seek independence, they would relocate their headquarters to England. This move would be a devastating blow to the Scottish financial sector and would underscore doubts regarding Scotland’s independent economic strength. Uncertainty about Scotland’s ability to function as a fully independent economic state would undoubtedly have made relationships with European Union states difficult, in particular given the increasing push for alternative and renewable energy sources by these nations. 
A Scottish state whose economic strength relied on the sale of fossil fuels would be supported somewhat hypocritically by those with serious ethical reservations about oil and by those committed to environmental improvement.
Scotland’s desire for independence is understandable, but ultimately impractical. However, Prime Minister Gordon Brown has pledged to work with those parties supporting separation to better address Scotland’s needs, although it has yet to be seen if the promised further devolution of powers to Edinburgh will occur. 
This vote may have wound up getting Scots more of what they want without sacrificing what they already have. Scotland has made the well-reasoned choice of staying part of the UK, valuing economic stability over cultural pride.

On Sept. 12, Dean of Student Affairs Gina Casalegno sent a campus-wide email drawing attention to further institutional efforts against sexual assault and sexual harassment following the policy approved in April 2013. As part of the update, Casalegno announced curricula revisions, enhanced trainings, increased staffing, and a mandatory online training program for incoming undergraduates called Haven.
As a campus, we have yet to see how implementation of these measures will affect campus culture, but a number of them show promise in changing conversations about sexual violence on campus.
Among the efforts Casalegno highlighted is the establishment of focus groups to facilitate the dialogue. It may seem like a trivial measure, but these focus groups go a step beyond the reactive, largely ineffective town-hall-style discussions we have seen from the administration in the past. The focus groups take a proactive approach by targeting specific groups in the Carnegie Mellon community, including athletes, members of Greek life, and LGBTQ students.
Attendance at the focus group session on Wednesday, for example, is reserved for members of student government and leaders of student organizations. According to a Sept. 17 email update from the Bridge, “[Leaders across campus] have a tremendous amount of influence over the health of campus community and also have a unique perspective on how sexual harassment and sexual violence affects our community.”
By intentionally reaching out to community members who carry influence in the discussion, the university shows that this measure is not simply a knee-jerk reaction to a community spotlight on a difficult issue. Instead, the administration’s efforts are purposeful and strategic in directly addressing as many community members as possible.
When a policy change occurs on campus, an easy criticism to make is that new programs will likely fall short of instituting change. The policy, the new programs, and their timing are not perfect, but if proper advantage is taken of these focus groups, then community members and leaders can take initiative in shifting the dialogue.

On Sept. 15, 2014, the Tartan Board published an editorial entitled “PA environmental issues need CMU attention” that calls on the university to focus its attention on local environmental issues, especially the impacts of shale gas development. The editorial implies that the university does not conduct such research already.
Had your editorial board asked Carnegie Mellon's Scott Institute on Energy Innovation leadership about what research was taking place at Carnegie Mellon on this topic, we would have been pleased to report that Carnegie Mellon has extensive research activity on the issue of shale and the environment in Western Pennsylvania. Much of Carnegie Mellon's work is summarized in a Scott Institute policymaker guide entitled: “Shale Gas and the Environment: Critical Need for a Government-University-Industry Research Initiative.”  Some of this research described in the guide has led to action, including a major change in Pennsylvania policy on the handling of wastewater from shale gas development activities.
In addition, Carnegie Mellon faculty chair major national and regional advisory committees, teach courses, and provide testimony at congressional and regional federal agency hearings focused on shale and the environment. The Scott Institute also hosts public events discussing shale gas development issues in this region.  And, just this week, we authored an article in The Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper, that highlights the importance of regionally-focused research on shale gas development.
Should the editors ask, the Scott Institute would be more than happy to assist them in identifying subject matter for an article on the subject.

Whether a person has requested direct help or not, it is important to lend a helping hand. It will be returned later when you are in a pinch.
