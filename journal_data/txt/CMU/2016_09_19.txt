The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team took the field at home on Wednesday to face off against Washington and Jefferson College. The Tartans dominated the Presidents 4–0, which improves the Tartans’ record to 3–2 on the season.
The game began slowly, but the Tartans started to apply pressure by playing on the opposing side of the field and getting some early shots on goal. Junior midfielder Tori Iatarola had two shots on goal early in the game, both ending wide of the goal. 
The Presidents also had a shot on goal in the 13th minute, but it bounced off the post and the Tartans maintained subtle control of the game. The first score came in the 22nd minute, when junior defender Alex Moy connected with first-year forward Sydney Webber in the midfield. Webber then found sophomore forward Kaily Bruch on the sideline, and Bruch skirted around a defender before making a break for the goal. She sent a low kick to the far goal post and the shot went in, and giving the Tartans their first real momentum of the game with a one-point lead.
The Tartans did not let up in the second half, and in the 47th minute they earned a free kick. From about 50 yards away from the goal, junior defender Katie Strycharz sent the ball toward the goal where a defender knocked the ball away with a header. Moy responded quickly and gathered the free ball, then sent a kick to the far side of the net to earn her first goal of the season and to put the Tartans up 2–0.
The Tartans went right back to scoring, when two minutes later first-year forward Ryan Casey scored her third goal of the season by rebounding a blocked shot taken by Iatarola. The Tartans had a 3–0 lead at this point and looked very comfortable closing the game out
.
Iatarola scored the final goal of the game for the Tartans in the 80th minute, when she returned a blocked shot from sophomore forward Katja Bracklemanns-Puig. Iatarola floated a shot right over the goalkeeper’s head and secured the fourth goal of the game for the Tartans.
Tartan goalkeeper sophomore Sarah Mahler preserved the shutout in the 89th minute with a diving save, and left no question as to who was the better team that day.
The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team returns to play on Tuesday, Sept. 20 when they travel to Baldwin Wallace University and try to improve their record. The game is set to start at 7 p.m.

On Saturday, the Carnegie Mellon football team faced off against the Waynesburg Yellow Jackets. The Tartans won the game 35–23, improving to 1–1 overall and 1–0 in the Presidents’ Athletic Conference (PAC).
The Tartan offense did not have a great first drive, having to punt after getting one first down. Waynesburg immediately gave the ball back as junior outside linebacker Quentin Wolfe recovered a fumble, and junior quarterback Bryan Jangro was able to get a touchdown two plays later, putting the Tartans up by seven points. On the next drive, the Tartan defense forced the Yellow Jackets to punt, but first-year running back William Richter returned the ball for 30 yards into Waynesburg territory. Waynesburg’s defense, however, was able to stuff junior running back Sam Benger, and Jangro was unable to get a completion on third down. 
The Tartans decided to go for it, but Jangro was unable to escape the pocket, giving the football right back to the Yellow Jackets. Wolfe was able to bail the offense out as he sacked Waynesburg’s quarterback on third down, forcing them to punt.
Richter made another great return into Waynesburg territory, and though the Tartans were unable to convert on third down, sophomore running back Rory Hubbard ran on fourth down all the way to the goal line. On the next play, Jangro underthrew the football, resulting in an interception, but the Tartan defense was once again able to force Waynesburg to punt. Benger was able to get some success against the Yellow Jacket defense on the next drive, especially on a draw play that ended the first quarter.
The Tartans were unable to progress at the start of the second quarter, punting it away. After the defense retrieved the ball for the Tartans, the Tartan offense once again fizzled. Instead of punting it away, senior running back Mike Minjock received a direct snap, making a first down for the Tartans. Jangro still seemed to have some troubles with accuracy, but junior wide receiver John Prather was able to make a key first down after making a difficult catch. The Tartans had a chance for a touchdown, but Jangro overthrew his man. The Tartans later tried a field goal, but the ball sailed left. Waynesburg then marched down the field, making it into the endzone and tying the game up 7–7. The Tartan offense wasn’t able to do anything on their next drive, and Waynesburg managed the remaining time on the clock to their advantage: getting all the way to the Tartan goal line for a field goal attempt that sailed wide left, keeping the game tied up the end of the first half.
The Yellow Jackets took to the offense again in the second half, but the Tartan defense was able to stop them. The ball changed sides several times more as each offense tried to break the stalemate. Disaster looked like it had stricken when Jangro took a heavy sack, but sophomore quarterback Alex Cline was able to get a third down conversion before Benger was finally able to break free and score a touchdown, putting the Tartans up 14–7.
The Yellow Jackets got the ball back with good field position after a kickoff return brought them to the 42-yard line, but they once again went nowhere. The Tartan offense was pinned deep and didn’t dare to try anything risky. After getting the ball back in Tartan territory, the Yellow Jackets looked like they would once again fizzle before making a huge third and long conversion. Waynesburg made it down to the goal line, but the Tartan defense forced them to settle for a field goal, their lead slimming to 14–10. On the next drive, Cline tried to get the ball out, but he fumbled as he was taken down, and Waynesburg got the football back at the end of the quarter.
The Yellow Jackets wasted no time getting the ball into the end zone as the fourth quarter began, getting a completion that put them up 17–14. After a 27-yard kickoff return by Richter, Prather hauled in a pass and went for over 50 yards into Waynesburg’s red zone. The Tartans kept pushing forward, and on third and goal, Cline threw the ball to the left end of the end zone where Prather was able to haul it in to put the Tartans up 21–17.
The Tartan defense once again stopped the Waynesburg offense, and Richter brought the ball back to the Yellow Jackets’ side of the field. The Tartans looked like they had gotten a long completion, but it was ruled out of bounds, resulting in another punt that pinned the Yellow Jackets within their 10-yard line. Waynesburg was once again unable to get anything done on offense, and the Tartans went to work at killing the clock. Benger and Hubbard got the Tartans to the goal line before junior wide receiver Alex Froimzon made a one handed catch for a touchdown, putting the Tartans up 28–17.
Waynesburg wasn’t done fighting, taking the next kickoff past the 50-yard line. They quickly advanced further, and got a touchdown pass to cut the Tartans’ lead to 28–23. The Yellow Jackets tried and failed a two-point conversion, even after a holding call against the Tartans gave them a second chance at the attempt. Though the game plan for the next drive was milking more time off the clock, Benger found tons of open room and made a 64-yard run, and Hubbard took it in to the end zone a few plays later, giving the Tartans an insurmountable 35–23 lead going into the latter part of the competition.
Waynesburg’s return man had a chance for a kickoff return touchdown, but junior punter and kicker Tyler Kohman took him down, even though he had to commit to a horse collar tackle to do so. Kohman’s tackle eliminated any last hopes the Yellow Jackets had as time ran out.
This game was a tough fight from start to finish. For much of the game, Waynesburg was able to hold Benger in check, forcing Jangro to try and make something happen himself. Jangro took a particularly heavy hit that forced him to leave the game, though hopefully he will recover soon.
Despite the tough fight Waynesburg put up, the Tartans held a clear edge on special teams as Kohman forced the visitors to fight harder for yardage and Richter gave the Tartan offense good field position. Cline was able to energize the offense, and the efforts of his passing game allowed Benger and Hubbard to break loose in the end. The Tartans will be up for some tough battles in the games to come, but they proved today that they have the fortitude to keep pressing forward.
The Tartans will next play at Thomas More College on Saturday, Sept. 24.

The human mind has pushed beyond the limits of gravity and our atmosphere through science fiction long before technology started catching up in the 1960s.
Star Trek in particular, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year since its release in 1966, allowed the imaginations of millions to fly beyond the borders of concrete science.
Taking the good and bad of human nature and expanding it out by light-years with the help of advanced technologies, some of which have since come to reality and some of which still only exist in our creative minds, Star Trek continues to inspire people of every field, including many at Carnegie Mellon.
For The New York Times best-selling author Daniel Wilson, who earned his Ph.D in robotics at Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute in 2005, the themes in his science fiction stories parallel the ones in the Star Trek universe. The technology in both is a medium to convey the greater underlying themes of the literature or artwork itself.
In a university press release, Wilson said, “Inspiration can come from anywhere, a pretty sounding word, an intriguing new technology or an image that comes to mind during a certain song.”
Meanwhile, for René Auberjonois, who graduated in 1962 from Carnegie Mellon’s School of Drama and went on to be an actor in the Star Trek universe, being part of the Star Trek cast was “almost more than one could hope for.”
Auberjonois said in the same press release, “It’s an honor to be even a small part of a work of art that has touched the lives of so many in a positive and hopeful way.”
Auberjonois is not the only Carnegie Mellon alumnus who is part of the Star Trek team. Zachary Quinto, another School of Drama alumnus, has played Spock three times. Mark Worthington, also a School of Drama alumnus, is the production designer for CBS’s new “Star Trek: Discovery,” due to be released online in 2017.
At Carnegie Mellon, there is even a class on technology — offered for science majors in the fall as a mini-course and as a full semester course for all students in the spring — that uses examples from movies and television shows, including Star Trek.
Technology has progressed at such a rapid rate that some of the technology in Star Trek is already real, such as the fictional crewmembers’ handheld communication devices, which are similar to today’s smartphones, or the tablet-sized computers reminiscent of iPads that even have a Siri-like feature. 
Some pieces of technology do not exist quite yet, but are close, such as Star Trek’s holodeck, which makes the user feel like they are touching something; however, this particular invention is similar to a more advanced version of current virtual reality technology.
Some technologies are impossible by today’s standards, such as the transporter devices that move items and people thousands of miles very quickly in the fictional universe. 
While Star Trek may be a fictional universe, the technological advancements are very real. One thing that will remain certain is that works like Star Trek will continue to inspire our imaginations beyond our physical limitations for many, many years to come.

As technology evolves, the ability for machines to create a user experience that imitates human-human interaction also evolves. Voice recognition software, used to carry out commands or to take note of information said by the user, is crucial to that experience. Software such as Siri and Cortana (even with its questionable accuracy) are undoubtedly powerful pieces of work that are able to create unique, customized user experiences based primarily on verbal input.
Voice recognition software works via a complicated process. The audio input, in the form of analog input, is first converted to a digital input using an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). 
During this process, the background noise is also filtered from the input, stabilized to a constant volume level, and slowed or sped up to match that of the software.
This digital, clean version is then fragmented into segments that may last only up to a hundredth of a second based on the sounds that they contain. These short sounds match to phonemes in the set language. Phonemes are the most basic parts of the language; they are the sounds that combine to form words, such as ‘p’ or ‘t’.
Cleaning and slicing the input is significantly easier than trying to decipher the content of the phoneme-match with reference to the input’s context. 
Early voice recognition software used rule-based systems to convert digital data to meaningful sentences. The problem with those systems was their obvious need to adhere to standard input. 
Slang and people’s different sentence structures were difficult to recognize. Even just continuous conversational input without pauses after every input was hard to detect. 
In order to overcome these challenges, today’s voice recognition software employs sophisticated statistical modeling algorithms to predict the most likely and most sensible outcome for the input. 
An older, similarity-based algorithm was the dynamic time warping algorithm that, simplistically put, optimally matched short segments based on similarity of a particular characteristic. 
Today, the Hidden Markov model is the most used algorithm because of its accuracy, computational feasibility, simplicity, and ability to be trained automatically.  Like a typical learning program, this algorithm assigns probability scores to a given input based on the pre-determined set of words and training data. Given that most programs have 60,000 words, which makes trillions of word combinations possible to form a sentence, it is indeed a significantly important issue to reduce the number of possibilities to a reasonable set of accurate possibilities.
Although voice recognition software is pretty sophisticated today, there are limitations to its functional performance. For example, even with all the new, though questionably cool, features in the iPhone7, there is one thing that’s still missing — the ability for Siri to recognize puns. 
One pretty obvious point of confusion is homonyms. Words that sound the same, such as ‘hair’ and ‘hare’, or ’bald’ and ‘bawled,’ can produce really interesting misinterpretations. Other limitations include low signal-noise ratios, overlapping speech, and the need for heavy computational power.
In terms of user experience, voice recognition can be used for home automation, in-car control, military vehicle operation, and even our very own J.A.R.V.I.S. 
Besides the fact that voice recognition allows for fantastic new user experiences, it can be used for a variety of other purposes.
Language learning, pronunciation practice, and, one day, maybe even universal translators, are fabulous new ways to harness all this potential.
Voice recognition systems have also been employed for people with disabilities and injuries. 
Thus, voice recognition, though sophisticated, is set to become an integral part of the next 50 years, with all the potential benefits it offers.

New disease carried by mosquitos detected in Haiti
University of Florida researchers have recently discovered a mosquito-borne virus that had not been previously reported in Brazil. Categorized as a Mayaro virus, it originated from one of the blood samples collected by faculty from the University of Florida Emerging Pathogens Institute during and after a viral epidemic occurred a few years ago on the island of Hispaniola. 
The virus came from an eight-year-old boy in rural Haiti who demonstrated fever and abdominal pain. A reverse transcription polymerase reaction was done to genetically identify the new virus in the sample. 
According to John Lednicky, an associate professor at the University of Florida and lead author of the study, it is uncertain whether the virus originated from Haiti, or was a genetic hybrid of different types of Mayaro virus. The findings can be located in the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Emerging Infectious Diseases Journal.

Uber debuts self-driving vehicles in city of Pittsburgh
Last Wednesday, Uber launched its self-driving pilot program in Pittsburgh. For the past year, Uber has kept a low profile on its development of autonomous cars. The work took place at the Advanced Technologies Center, which has recruited Carnegie Mellon University researchers and faculty, in addition to partnering with automakers including Volvo. The ultimate goal is to have the autonomous vehicles replace much of the company’s 1.5 million drivers, while taking lead in the car business industry.
Each self-driving vehicle is a Ford Fusion equipped with 3D cameras, global positioning systems (GPS), and lasers that measure the shape and distance of objects. As the car navigates to the customer’s destination, a driver and engineer are physically present to take control when needed. According to experts, more research and development still need to be done before autonomous cars can become widespread on roads.

Honeycreepers, Kauai’s native bird, nearing extinction
According to a new study in Science Advances, the disappearance of Kauaian honeycreepers could mean an extinction of multiple honeycreeper species in the Hawaiian Islands within the next decade. After arriving to the Hawaiian Islands millions of years ago, the ancestors of the finch-like birds had proliferated into more than 50 diverse species, an evolutionary phenomenon that has long captivated many scientists.
The decline in honeycreepers can be attributed to a rise in temperature, which has harbored the spread of mosquito-borne diseases, including avian malaria and avian poxvirus. The honeycreepers also have a more difficult time finding food due to competition with other birds foreign to the islands, as well as the presence of invasive plants. 
However, avian scientists believe the birds could potentially be saved through advanced mosquito control techniques, which may be effective but challenging to implement.

Scientists suggest conception without eggs can occur
A recent publication in Nature Communications suggests that in the distant future, eggs may not be necessary for making babies. Researchers at the University of Bath applied chemicals to transform an unfertilized mouse egg into a pseudo-embryo. Sperm was then injected into the pseudo-embryos, which led to successful pregnancies in 25 percent of the mouse experiments. Additionally, the mice born from the experiments were found to be normal and healthy, and were also able to make healthy offspring themselves.
Since a pseudo-embryo replicates and monitors the DNA much like ordinary cells, scientists believe that it is possible to produce a baby by combining ordinary cells from the body with sperm to form human embryos. The study has allowed scientists to learn more about the enigmatic mechanisms behind fertilization. Furthermore, it could lead to more knowledge on ways to reprogram the fate of cells during the early development of life.

Movement of atoms may lead to better superconductors
At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, physicists were able to lower the temperature of a potassium gas very close to absolute zero. The cool gas was then contained in between a two-dimensional, laser-generated lattice.
For the first time, high-resolution microscopic images were taken of the atoms as they interacted with the lattice. In studying the positions of the atoms, the researchers were astonished to see that in areas of high gas compression, atoms displayed alternating magnetic orientations. They also discovered that pairs of atoms tend to form next to empty spaces in the lattice.
From studying the peculiar behavior of the atoms, the physicists were able to learn more about superconducting behavior. Knowing how to induce superconductivity in matter can allow the researchers to devise ways to make novel and efficient technology powered by electricity. The results were reported in the journal Science.

Astronomers unveil most detailed map of Milky Way galaxy
With data collected by a billion-pixel camera on a Gaia probe, a robotic spacecraft launched by the European Space Agency a few years ago, astronomers were able to create the currently largest and most detailed map of the Milky Way.
The map, which was published online last week, features visual information of the positions and brightness of more than 1.1 billion stars, accounting for one percent of stars estimated to be in the Milky Way. The data will enable astronomers to develop a three-dimensional map of the galaxy, which will improve astronomers’ understanding of the distribution and movement of stars across space. 
Additionally, astronomers can use the data to identify new planets outside the solar system and to see how planets are distributed in relation to  parent stars. The latter could lead to better knowledge of planetary formation.

As self-driving cars move rapidly from fantasies into our current reality, there are ethical questions surrounding their use that we haven’t had to consider until now.
Machines that make decisions have been around for quite a while, but civilians have not had access to autonomous machines with the destructive capacity of automobiles. When cars collide with either stationary objects or other cars, there is usually severe damage done to everything involved in the crash. Since these situations arise for unpredictable reasons, there has to be an ethical framework for the cars to make decisions and for who is liable when the cars do damage.
The first question that has to be answered is who does the car prioritize when it has to decide who lives and who dies.
Ethically, this is a complex question.
A purely consequentialist car will decide what course of action is most likely to save the most people, but this calculation is affected by many factors. 
It may never be possible to preemptively tell code exactly who is inside or outside the car, how likely that person would be to survive a collision, and many other relevant pieces of information within the time that the car could respond to the crash.
A car that is more ethically focused on the decision rather than the result would have to have a consistent process for determining its reaction to each potential crash. Any process will be subject not only to ethical skepticism but also the individual needs of each person and each collision. 
Someone’s biography and relationships to the people around them might also become relevant in ways that are hard or impossible to get the car to respond to. If parents were dropping their kids off at school and those kids run into the street in front of that car, parents would probably want their car to avoid their own kid and a person possibly could make that reaction, but a car likely cannot.
Most manufacturers of self-driving cars have decided to prioritize the driver’s safety in every situation. The most obvious justification for this is that if a consumer has to choose between two cars and one is more likely to kill them, they will almost certainly choose the one that they are less likely to die in. 
This is a market force and not an ethical decision, but it has some merit. If everyone on the road was in a car that prioritized its own driver’s safety, cars would be very predictable in their responses to unexpected obstacles and people on the road would more likely be safe in accidents because everyone’s car is preserving their own safety. In collisions with pedestrians, the pedestrian is in danger, but pedestrians move very slowly compared to cars and are easier to safely avoid entirely.
Either way, this process has to be universal so cars do not have individual decision-making processes. Otherwise, cars would be unpredictable, leading to more collisions. 
Further, corporations have a profit incentive, not a public benefit incentive, so the decision-making process is in better hands if it is universal and made outside the corporate environment.
Another question that surrounds self-driving cars is liability; if a self-driving car gets into an accident, who is responsible?
Pugwash was unanimous that collisions between fully autonomous vehicles should be the responsibility of the companies who designed the driving algorithms for the cars involved. 
Firstly, their processes for driving are what failed and caused the collision.
Secondly, this gives those companies easy access to data points that they can use to improve their algorithms, and legal pressure and investigations could ensure increased safety of self-driving cars.
Semi-autonomous vehicles were more of a gray area. Semi-autonomous vehicles often have instruction manuals telling the driver to be aware and to take control of the car if necessary. This could lead to more user error when people crash a car that would have otherwise gotten itself out of the situation, but it also means people are responsible for being the failsafe for their own vehicle. 
Pedestrians can also cause collisions by being negligent in how they cross the street. The current process of determining fault is probably the best way to deal with this.
Changes in technology often introduce a new context for ethical questions, and automating something with as much potential for damage as driving cars makes those questions very relevant. 
Making sure these questions get answered, or at least acknowledged, is key to ensuring that the future of self-driving cars is pursued responsibly by both car companies and car owners.
Student Pugwash is a non-advocacy, educational organization that discusses the implications of science. This article is a summary of last week’s discussion on self-driving cars.

Dear Sarah,
Now that I'm a sophomore and I'm living off-campus, no more RA, no more beep boop on the way to class, and no more meal plan. And that last one is the real problem. I'm inept, lazy, and poor. All of the odds are against me.
My mom makes it look so easy, cooking dinner every single day. Because she obviously never involved me in that process, I don't really know how to plan and cook a meal. But I am an expert at spooning a can of SpaghettiO's into a bowl and turning on the microwave. 
You're probably thinking, you can't live on SpaghettiOs, that's terrible for your health. Well, you're right. But I'm more concerned about my time and money. That's what I miss the most about my meal plan: the immediate gratification of prepared food, without swiping my debit card or forking out cash.
I could buy a can of off-brand SpaghettiOs at Aldi for $.65! Then in two minutes, I have a warm bowl of food that's going to fill me up, and I didn't have to chop, dice, season, sauté, roast, or plate. Ain't nobody got time for that! I could save myself so many verbs by just putting crap in the microwave. 
But alas, my parents are worried about my nutrition. They give me grocery money and tell me to buy vegetables, protein, and whole grains, so I just have all of these ingredients in my kitchen. When I'm hungry, standing in front of my fridge, all I can see are the minutes upon minutes of labor it would take to turn it all into something I want to eat when I could just be lying down watching Parks and Rec. I want the convenience of takeout, but I don't want to pay for it.
I'm at a loss. How do I reconcile all of my needs?
Grumbling stomach sound,
Sadly Eating No Dinner Seriously Need A Cheap KFC Sandwich
Dear SENDSNACKS,
I can't tell you how many times I've yearned for the days when I could just put on some pants, walk to The Underground, and be back in bed 10 minutes later with chicken fingers and french fries.
It's complicated. Part of "adulting" is getting over yourself and doing things that suck. Yes, it sucks like heck to stand up for more than two minutes — I'm very sensitive to that. But there are ways to spread it out and make it easier.
If you can dedicate a couple of hours each weekend to going balls to the wall and preparing meals in advance, this will make those weeknights where you just want to inhale your weight in food from the comfort of your bed that much easier. Store the leftovers in containers in the fridge or freezer (depending how long you need them to last), so that when dinner time rolls around all you need to do is pop one in the microwave! Maximum satisfaction, minimum effort, zero money out of your pocket.
The best meals to do this with are "casseroles" like baked ziti or enchiladas, a good hearty soup (think taco soup), or just pieces of meat, like baked chicken breasts or pulled pork in the crockpot. Even having your meat prepared will make the rest of the meal prep so much easier. If you have a chicken breast, all you need is noodles, sauce, cheese, water, and you have chicken parm! This will feel easier to tackle when all you can think about is the homework you have to do and sleep you need to catch up on.
Believe in yourself. If you make the task of cooking more manageable, you will be more successful!
Happy cooking,
Sarah

The routine is almost set. 7 a.m. my alarm blares harmoniously through my room to wake me up and by seven thirty I’m in the kitchen putting an acceptable meal together. By eight, I’ve got my headphones in and I’m strolling down to class, and by nine thirty class is over. 
The sun never fails to throw a regal glow over my furniture just before seven, devoid of the excessive warmth of the afternoon, and so I had to consider a means of shifting between the sleeves: short and long, and the pant lengths: short and long. 
The routine settled in quite well at first. The morning air at the beginning of the school year is crisp and cooler than the rest of the day. I could comfortably wear my gym shorts and old shirt under a hoodie and ditch the hoodie on the way back home. Then came the complications. 
Sometimes the sneakers made my feet feel sweaty, and sometimes it would rain while I was out in flip flops. Sometimes my socks would slip under my ankles if I wore sneakers, and pinch hard around my ankles in boots. There were times when I wanted warm tea, but by the time it was ready, the heat of noon had already made its way through my system. At times I would leave my sunglasses and the bottom of my bag and debate between squinting on the way home, or digging through my belongings.
The complications crept into my mind, and towered over me while I stared, aimlessly into my closet. The little voice that usually lulls me into a trance while I walk down a dark street at night whispered curses under its breath. There before me hung sweater after sweater, color-coded and cold, pushed to the side to leave room for the flirty sundress, the floral blouse, and the casual scarf.
Swimming through my head were the usual images. The crunchy crimson leaves, the rich orange of pumpkins and the sweet cinnamon bouquet of apple cider. I craved the warmth in the cold and the cold in the sun. I could see myself sorting through sweaters, picking which one to wear when, and where, and with who. The thick black and white stripes for the night out to an event and the blushing pink to brighten up a gloomy day. I would wear the deep navy when it was raining and pair it with the black tights and the boots. Oh the boots.
The thick rubbery blues for the rain, and the black faux leather ankles for the weekend. The UGG knock-offs for impulsive target runs and the fur-lined knee-highs for those particularly chilly nights. And of course, you would pairs those with the hats. The beanies that you pull down over your ears as the air nips at your face, and their flaps that you tie around your chin when it gets too windy. The soft ones for when the day looks like it’s going to be rough, and the sharp ones for when you need to class it up. These of course match, those gloves. The gloves with the touchscreen compatible tips and the hooks that keep them together so that you don’t lose them in the sleeves of your jackets. The deep maroon one with the double breasted buttons and the collar that surpasses your neck. The black one that goes with everything, even though it’s missing a button, and the scraggly one that you probably should throw away but never will.
But alas, I heave a heavy sigh, for today, the sun is still shining with all its might and my sweaters must remain where they are.

Life has its ups and its downs. Somedays you feel worse off than other days and sometimes life hits you with something that makes you feel like that for months on end. Mike (Jon Favreau) — deprecating protagonist of Doug Liman’s Swingers — is going through one of these periods in his life. He is a standup comic who has moved to LA to find work, but has not met with any success, and on top of that he is coming out of a six year relationship. His life is in shambles. In this backdrop, his friends Rob (Ron Livingston), Trent (Vince Vaughn), and Sue (Patrick Van Horn) try to cheer him up by taking him out to bars, clubs, and diners to meet new girls.
I love the way this film begins: the opening scene is set in a diner with Mike and Rob sitting in a booth. Mike says to Rob, “Okay, so what if I don't want to give up on her?” Rob,  “You don't call.” Mike, “But you said I don't call if I wanted to give up on her!” Rob, “Right.” 
This scene tells us so much: it establishes the setting, the plot and the mood. It introduces us to the protagonist Mike, and tells us that he keeps brooding about a girl, and that his friends are trying to help him get over it. Most importantly though, the scene gives us a taste of the kind of humor to come.
The film can be accurately described as a comedy drama, and it is hilarious. For example consider the things that happen when Trent convinces Mike to go to Vegas. They both suit up and drive to Vegas from Los Angeles so that they can show up as high rollers and get all the free comps. They start the trip enthusiastically shouting, “Vegas, baby, Vegas!” However, on the long drive there, their enthusiasm mellows down to nothing. Instead of the crazy ride there, we see what really happens on drives to far off places — drowsiness and stops at seedy gas stations. When they get there we see their stylish entry into a casino only to find old people playing slots with Mike describing the place accurately as “dead.” This is the first film that I have found that accurately describes what happens when young people go to Vegas. They go into the casino with the expectation of a crazy time only to find old people playing slots and to make a fool of themselves at the gambling tables. The Vegas scenes also show us for the first time Mike and Trent’s attempts at getting with girls. 
We see how Trent is a natural at this but Mike fails miserably. The rest of the film shows how Trent, Mike, and friends hit up various bars and parties across LA in search of  women. Typically, this is followed with Mike messing things up really quickly. See what happens when Mike does muster up the courage to go and talk to a girl. He says hi and she asks what kind of car he drives. Ashen faced he names the type of his broken down car and then shouts that it’s red, it’s a red car before turning away embarrassed. This scene is quickly followed by Trent talking to a girl, getting her number and then tearing the number up as he walks away from her. The next time they go out, Mike does manage to get a girls number. However, in one of the most excruciatingly painful scenes in the movie, we see how Mike desperately leaves the girl five to six messages on her phone the night he meets her before the girl picks up and asks him never to call her again.
In between all these mess ups on Mike’s part, his friends are constantly trying to pick him up by saying things like, “Baby, you’re so money and you don't even know it!” It’s their way of saying that Mike has so much going for him and yet he fails to see it. The characters in this movie have a language of their own. They refer to girls as ‘beautiful babies’ and whenever something is impressive they say ‘that’s so money!.’ Not to mention the things they say to pick up girls, including “this is the guy behind the guy behind the guy.” Most of it doesn't make sense and the movie makes fun of that. 
Through all the jokes and missteps though, the movie has an important message to impart. It reminds us of the importance of friends; Trent, Rob and Sue try their best to help Mike meet girls so that he forgets about his girlfriend. This movie truly shows how your friends are there for you when you’re going through a rough patch. How they constantly keep trying to lift your mood and remind you that, “Baby, you're so money!”

So I missed the first week of classes to go on a family trip to China. When I tell people this, the most common response I get is “why?” Why did I, the history nerd, want to visit one of the oldest and most culturally rich countries on the planet? Why did I, the college senior in respectable academic standing, opt for a once-in-a-lifetime experience (or if I’m lucky, twice) over yet another syllabus week? Or is the question why did [ITAL]I[ITAL] go? Me: the white girl, all-American and embarrassingly unilingual, with a “chinaboo” kid sister and parents who won a big case this year. Everyone calls travel “eye-opening” and “life-changing,” and I don’t expect to escape all the clichés. But travel is also an exercise in privilege. 
While abroad, I try my best to blend. I imagine the worst “American Tourist” stereotype and will myself to embody the opposite. Be polite and respectful. No dumb questions. Pay attention to the tour guide. Never assume that you know better. Heed all “no pictures” signs, especially in places of religious significance. No complaints about people not speaking your language; the average schoolchild here knows more English than you know of Mandarin, you poop. No demands that anything — the food, the weather, even the plane rides — conform to your expectations. Always be flexible. And most of all, never forget: this is not your exotic vacation locale, this is not your cultural zoo. This is you visiting an unfamiliar world filled with people more similar to you than not, learning and exploring and most importantly leaving it again untouched. 
Despite my rules, I did not blend in even a little. The curly red hair and pale-as-paper skin earned me open stares almost everywhere my family went. On a visit to the Forbidden City in Beijing, I was grabbed — quite literally grabbed — for a selfie by at least six locals. I felt like something of a minor celebrity; it was flattering and bizarre and anxiety inducing all at once. For the first time, my whiteness had granted me “minority” status. But unlike other minorities, my whiteness didn’t put me at risk for harassment or discrimination or oppression; the only bullet I had to dodge was a camera flash.
Tours of Buddhist temples and monasteries left me similarly uncomfortable. I was torn between awe at these places’ beauty and millennia of symbolic meaning, and fear that my very presence was an intrusion on these people’s deeply held religious beliefs. I nearly panicked in front of a 2,000-year-old golden Buddha in a Lhasa temple. Burning yak butter and heady incense permeated my nostrils and made my head swim. Dozens of local people jostled me from every side, single-minded in their determination to pray at one of the holiest sites in the world. I was a foreign obstacle to their blinding faith, and I wanted out. I needed to breathe. 
Also, for all that Beijing, Shanghai, and Xian are industrialized, modern cities, I never forgot that I was visiting a distinctly non-democratic country. Chairman Mao gazed serenely out at Tiananmen Square, manned every twenty or so yards by an armed officer. “Big Brother’s” webcam sat innocently on the dashboard of our Lhasa van, ready to report any incendiary things our guide might say. Funnily enough, I was able to open the “OkCupid” app — but the nearest users it picked up were in Bangladesh. And of course, every tour guide smilingly referred to my father as a “businessman,” unaware that his daughter — raging liberal and aspiring revolutionary — was sitting quietly in the backseat.
There were simpler, less fraught moments of angst. I spent an hour tracking down my missing suitcase in Xian. I sat down for five minutes in Beijing and got eaten alive by mosquitoes. I had more than one less-than-flawless encounter with a squat toilet. And don’t even get me started on Tibet. Lhasa was three days of pounding headaches, total lack of appetite, and the vague feeling that I was floating. Altitude sickness is so real. Incidentally, Lhasa was also the midway point of the trip, right around when all my friends were posting “just got back! let’s get dinner!” messages in the group chat I couldn’t reply to. Holed up in our hotel’s “oxygen lounge” and trapped behind the “Great Firewall” of China, I read through these messages and wished I was back in the ‘Burgh with them. The grass is always greener, I suppose.  
There were also simple moments of joy. To anyone looking for a pick-me-up, I wholeheartedly recommend the panda breeding center in Chengdu, or these awesome fried soup dumplings in Shanghai, or the aerial view of mountainous Lhasa after a lung-beating climb. I am bowled over by gratitude that I was privileged enough to do all this. So, I’d like to raise one of those obscenely large bottles of beer my parents received in every restaurant. Three cheers to adventure, to learning experiences, and to embracing the uncomfortable.

You made it! No, literally, you made it. On Murray Avenue and Forbes Street Sept. 17, the I Made It! Market had its last Squirrel Hill Night Market for the summer. The Night Market was previously held June 18 and Aug. 20, and is an initiative of NextGenPgh, Uncover Squirrel Hill, and the Squirrel Hill Urban Coalition, according to the official website of I Made It! Market.
The Squirrel Hill Night Market this month is also a part of Mayor William Peduto’s Bicentennial Celebration. This month, the Night Market was centered around the Asian culture and community of Pittsburgh. Bubble tea was rampant as per usual, but so was origami and other paper crafts. The 3D Origami Art Studio sold various origami sculptures and even kits so others could create and fold their own masterpieces. The shop specializes in kusudamas, Japanese flower balls and popular wedding decorations. While not having distinct Asian roots, Resident is another shop that sells kits that one can fold into their own geometric and deeply layered works of art, most often animal heads.
The Market also featured creative Asian-founded businesses. Local pastry shop Yummyholic is founded by Jasmine Cho and sells custom treats ranging from cookies in the shape of Oprah’s face to matcha velvet cupcakes. The shop is also branching out into apparel that promises to be “Phan Pho-King Tastic” and fully embrace their Asian roots.
Here are more highlights from the Squirrel Hill Night Market:
Go Carr Go: An art store specializing in the German paper cut art “scherenschnitte” with designs ranging from nerdy, a la Doctor Who and Alice in Wonderland, to classic red roses, or a silhouette of Pittsburgh’s Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio rivers. The shop brings a worldly vibe to the night market and the prints astound shoppers with their beauty and attention to detail.
Sorcery Science: This shop specializes in all things science related — but for jewelry. The shop is known for its molecular structure jewelry, with necklaces and earrings of caffeine, estrogen, and testosterone molecules, anatomical jewelry, with brain earrings and a necklace of a heart, and even periodic table quilts and a portable chess board. The chess board and all jewelry are laser cut and are perfect gifts for the science nerds in your life.
Songbird Artistry: Formerly known as Jenn’s Jems, the mother-daughter–run shop makes unique jewelry and ties inspired by pop culture hits like [ITAL]Harry Potter[ITAL], [ITAL]Game of Thrones[ITAL], [ITAL]Doctor Who[ITAL], and more. Songbird Artistry also sells Pittsburgh-inspired items as a beautiful homage to their roots, and makes screen-printed shirts and onesies of their designs for artists ranging from The Avett Brothers, Mumford and Sons, Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran.
Steel City Cotton Workers: Known for their “home grown quality,” Steel City Cotton Workers sells graphic tees, hoodies, and accessories with a main focus around Pittsburgh life, city, and culture. They were seen selling UPitt merchandise and shirts supporting the Pirates, Steelers, and the Penguins.
Papyrusaurus: Papyrusaurus is known for their “handmade goods with a geeky kick,” selling unique prints over vintage book pages with designs from [ITAL]Wicked[ITAL], [ITAL]Harry Potter[ITAL], [ITAL]Supernatural[ITAL], [ITAL]Doctor Who[ITAL], [ITAL]Firefly[ITAL], and more. They also sell earrings of little books and cute pins featuring covers of books as part of their Tiniest Book Club collection, as well as buttons and cards with their unique designs.
Strange Hours Atelier: A spiritual and tarot-themed store with “a keen interest in natural and unnatural history,” the patches that it sells feature designs inspired by tarots and the stars. The store also sells elaborate hats and buttons of their designs as well as intaglio etchings, a traditional form of printmaking.
Hip Modern Soap Co.: Hip Modern Soap Co. sells soap that is “vegan, sustainable, cruelty-free, God-fearin’, child-rearin', pants-droppin', eye-poppin', out-of-rhymes Steel City goodness.” Soap scents include the bright and colorful Carnival Soap, the cool and collected Watermelon Soap, the enigmatic blue Sherlock, and the fittingly fresh Fresh Fig Soap. The store also sells body butter and sugar scrubs.
In addition to featuring local Pittsburgh vendors and shops, the Night Market presented performances highlighting more of Asia’s rich and diverse culture. Carnegie Mellon’s own K-Pop Dance Club opened the night with their fun routines and Tuika’s Polynesian Island Magic lit up the street with their masterful performance of the Samoan Fire Knife Dance.
Live bands such as Steel City Ukuleles and The King Fez Band also played music throughout the night next to the variety of food trucks at the market, which ranged from the handcrafted and unique Stickler’s Ice Pops to the classic and delicious Pgh Crepes to Wok of Life Pgh, a healthy stir-fry food truck playing into the Market’s Asian theme.
Pittsburgh’s come a long way, and the Squirrel Hill Night Market was truly a vibrant celebration on Pittsburgh life and Pittsburgh Asian life, highlighting the city’s history and bringing together the community and the various cultures the town loves to embrace. So congrats Pittsburgh, you’ve made it!

"Drawings to Forget" was a solo drawing show put on by Paul Peng, a fifth-year BCSA fine arts and computer science student. The show ran in Carnegie Mellon's student gallery, The Frame, for the past two weeks, opening on Sept. 9 and closing on Sunday, Sept. 18. The series of drawings profiles the lives of two fictional protagonists: "Stephen Thundermaw, great-great-grandson of werewolf demigod and pharmaceutics pioneer and entrepreneur Rainbow Jenkins Thundermaw" and "Demyxtro “Demi” Jackson Crystalheart, a dragon-halfling hybrid with traces of water spirit, ex-partner." Peng portrayed these eccentric and fanciful characters in a style that was both cleanly minimal, but also intensely surreal. All beings depicted in his works verged on the domain of pseudo-furry fanfic, and he indulged in both the traditional medium of charcoal drawing and internet based meme culture. This duality allowed him to inscribe these characters with interesting personas. Throughout the drawings the characters oscillated between realistic human traits and fanciful furry personas, raising questions of which is more real or accurate to the being beneath the external traits. 
This show worked with the traditional medium of drawing and the traditional format of the white-wall gallery exhibition, and embraced those to their fullest with great success. The minimalist display of these works and the balancing of the composition of light and dark areas within worked with the composition of each square paper on the wall. The works were often intensely chaotic with a single empty area, or intensely barren with a single dark form, allowing for certain details to become hyper aware for the viewer and others to feel like they're being intentionally obfuscated. 
All together this show was a unique exploration of millennial internet culture through the lens of traditional, well composed charcoal drawings. The balance between the elegance of Peng's visual style with the wildly eccentric narrative of the works bridges a middle ground that makes the works surprisingly real and telling of the world of those raised on the internet.

Hundreds of people gathered in Wiegand Gymnasium on Friday afternoon to attend the senatorial campaign rally for Democratic candidate Katie McGinty. McGinty was joined by several other notable guests, including Braddock Mayor John Fetterman and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT).
As a member of the United States Senate, McGinty promises to take a stance on protecting the environment, defending women’s rights, and supporting middle class families. Having served as former Chief of Staff to Governor Tom Wolf, in addition to serving as Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, McGinty has an undeniably impressive track record. Despite the fact that she has never held political office, McGinty has proved herself to be a competitive candidate, with polls indicating that she is currently neck-to-neck with her biggest rival, Republican Senator Pat Toomey who has held a seat in Pennsylvania since 2011. McGinty has also been endorsed by heavyweight Democrats on Capitol Hill, including both President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, as well as Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).
McGinty’s role in this senatorial election cycle is crucial. If she is elected into the United States Senate, not only would she be the first-ever female senator to represent the state of Pennsylvania, but her win would also be a major victory for the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party needs to reclaim five senatorial seats to restore a majority, and securing Pennsylvania could be a near determinant factor to take back the Senate from the Republican Party. With the country witnessing a presidential election that has proven to be unpredictable, to say the least, the result of this senatorial election cycle is critical.
Emmett Eldred, a senior English and Philosophy double major and co-founder of Carnegie Mellon’s College Democrats organization kicked off the event with an enthusiastic introduction that seemed to rile up anticipation and excitement among members of the crowd. Pittsburgh City Councilman and Carnegie Mellon alum Dan Gilman also expressed his support for McGinty before welcoming John Fetterman to the stage.
Fetterman was an ideal choice to introduce McGinty, considering that his position as the mayor of Braddock and as somewhat of a local celebrity could help the campaign appeal to the local demographic. He left the audience laughing with several pop culture references, while also criticizing Senator Pat Toomey. In one of his remarks, Fetterman described Toomey’s questionable relationship with Donald Trump as, “the greatest love story since The Notebook.” Despite facing McGinty as an opponent in the primaries earlier this year, Fetterman showed his full support for her campaign. Fetterman stated “I know first hand better than anybody just how capable, how intelligent, how committed [McGinty] is to standing up for Pennsylvania’s middle class families.”
An eruption of cheers and chanting welcomed McGinty as she took the stage and invited her supporters to join her in “[shattering] the glass ceiling in the United States Senate.” Her speech commenced with negative appraisals of Senator Toomey, criticizing his support towards Wall Street corporations, his failure to stay loyal to his constituents, and his stance against college affordability. McGinty also addressed pitfalls of the American Dream, claiming that while Americans continue to work hard, the current political system keeps them from getting ahead. As the audience stirred in agreement, she continued, “any person giving it their all is deserving of our dignity and respect,” referring mainly to workers being paid minimum wage. She added, “your zip code is not your destiny,” an expression that Fetterman has also used liberally throughout his tenure as mayor of Braddock, where median household income and education statistics are notoriously low.
As McGinty made her concluding remarks, the crowd started buzzing in anticipation and finally exploded into uproar when Senator Bernie Sanders took the stage. This came as no surprise given his popularity among millennials during this presidential election cycle, which earned him the reputation as the leading progressive voice of the country. The former presidential candidate asserted that, “The future agenda of the United States of America may well rest on the results of this election, which is why we need Katie McGinty in the United States Senate.” He maintained the stance he took on many issues during his own campaign, including the need to reclaim the country’s wealth from the “top one percent.” It has become evident that Senator Sanders has an undeniable talent when it comes to appealing to his supporters, and his participation in McGinty’s campaign could prove to hold a significant advantage over Senator Toomey. The event came to a close with Senator Sanders’ forceful reminder that, “We are not a poor nation. We are the richest nation in the history of the world. Our job is to elect Katie and Secretary Clinton. Our job is to transform the United States of America.”

Carnegie Mellon University is leading the charge towards eliminating the gender gap in STEM fields with nearly 50 percent of this year’s first-year undergraduates for the School of Computer Science and College of Engineering consisting of women. While the national average of women with degrees in computer science and engineering fields has remained stagnant at around 20 percent throughout the years, Carnegie Mellon University has managed to increase the percentage of females within their School of Computer Science from seven percent to now more than 48 percent within the span of a decade.
Having claimed the title as the number one university to combat the STEM gender gap according to a ranking conducted by Her Campus, Carnegie Mellon University attributes this exponential increase in female enrollment towards a deliberate attempt to seek out more diversity, a nurturing and encouraging academic environment, and early outreach programs for students in high school and even middle school. Diversifying the composition of the student body enables the introduction of new and potentially revolutionary ideas. In a University press release, Jim Garrett, dean of the College of Engineering, remarked that, “Not only is this the right thing to do, it is important to have diverse perspectives included to improve the performance and results of engineering processes.” Garrett is one of many faculty members to share an appreciation for a community focused on enabling those who have seldom had the opportunity to flourish.
A multitude of organizations exist on campus dedicated to helping women pursue their passions and develop the necessary skills to leave a lasting impact on society. From encouraging nervous first-year students for upcoming exams, to providing young undergraduate students mentorship, WinECE (Women in Electrical Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University) is one of the many support groups available to women in need of assistance. Besides ensuring that all students feel comfortable and accepted, Carnegie Mellon University emphasizes the importance of collaboration. In a recent University press release, Jelena Kovacevicć, Hamerschlag University Professor and head of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, said that one of Carnegie Mellon University’s defining factors that sets it apart from other schools with STEM programs is the electrifying cooperation among students and faculty. “One of the things that Carnegie Mellon is known for is this deep immersion in a collaborative culture,” said Kovacevicć. “What that feels like is pure excitement; excitement about our research, excitement that it matters, excitement that we all do it together, students, faculty and staff. That’s what makes us unique.”
Research among students at Carnegie Mellon University shows that there is little difference in the amount of interest men and women express in STEM fields. So then why is there such a disparity in gender within today’s computer science and engineering job field? According to Lenore Blum, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy, the answer lies within the culture of computer science itself. Blum was an essential part of creating Women@SCS, a support network that enables female students to work with faculty members to help build relationships all around campus. Carol Frieze, director of Women@SCS, said the key to diversifying the modern workplace and propelling women to respectable positions is creating opportunities and social networks that have persistently been more commonly available to men.
The tight-knit relationships the Carnegie Mellon University staff creates and maintains with female students are paving the way for a radical change to the landscape of computer science and engineering. The drive and acceptance of the Carnegie Mellon community will serve only to leap across more boundaries for generations to come. According to Carnegie Mellon University’s president Subra Suresh, “these fields are key to shaping the 21st century, and Carnegie Melon University’s distinctive program offers young women and men the opportunity and environment to make a real difference.”

On Saturday, Oct. 8, Pittsburgh men will walk a mile in women’s shoes as they participate in the second annual Walk a Mile in Her Shoes PGH.
According to the organization’s website, Walk a Mile in Her Shoes is an international march that advocates to end rape, sexual assault, and gender violence. Participants in this movement wear high heels while walking for one mile as a way to raise awareness about the severity of these issues towards women. This event will take place in Pittsburgh at 5050 Liberty Avenue at 4:30 p.m. with a rally followed by the walk. The proceeds of this fundraiser will benefit the Pittsburgh Action Against Rape (PAAR) organization.
“This walk really is so important to have in a society like ours,” the Chair of Walk a Mile PGH Camille Goleb said. “Our society still tends to, for whatever reason, focus on the actions of the victim rather than the actions of the attacker. Things like that are really unacceptable, and events like this bring the attention to where it needs to be, which is prevention, education and discussions about consent.”
Historically, a huge focus of this event has been to prevent sexual assault through the actions of men, instead of having women focus on preventing getting raped. Walk a Mile in Her Shoes was founded by Frank Baird in 2001 and initially started with just a few men trying to make a statement. Now, Baird’s idea is practiced worldwide and makes millions of dollars for numerous programs that help support victims of sexual assault.
The Pittsburgh chapter of Walk a Mile in Her Shoes was started by Goleb after she moved here over a year ago and was disappointed that there were no annual events to spread awareness about sexual assault and support its victims. Goleb said that the city’s overall reception of the walk has been very positive.
“The event itself is supposed to be a little light-hearted, so most of our participants have felt happy, if not a little blistered and sore, after the walk,” Goleb said. “I most enjoy the impact of the rally on all of the participants. We usually have a survivor speak at the rally, and have lots of organizations tabling and providing resources not only for survivors, but for the community as a whole.”
These organizations at the walk are representatives of the many resources Pittsburgh has for survivors of sexual assault, including the PAAR organization. The organizers of the walk decided to have the money raised go to PAAR because of their positive reputation regarding education and advocacy of victims of sexualized violence.
Another way the event is being personalized for Pittsburgh is that after the walk there will be music by several local artists from 7 p.m. until midnight. These performances will happen at the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern and the Howlers. College students in the area can also get involved in this event.
“College students can get involved in this event right away,” Goleb said. “I highly encourage teams of Walkers to register. You can walk, wear a crazy outfit to unify your team, come to the rally, come to the concert, anything that you can.”
This walk is another way for college students to acknowledge the prevalence of sexual assault on campus. According to the website for the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN), “11.2 percent of all students [on college campuses] experience rape or sexual assault through physical force, violence, or incapacitation.” This includes both undergraduate and graduate students. The massive number of college students impacted by this is another reason why the walk is so important.
Both males and females can sign up for the walk, and as for the guys who have never walked in heels, Goleb says not to worry.
“For those that aren’t used to walking in heels, we’ll have a coach at the rally to show you the ropes,” Goleb said. “I can’t wait to see everyone’s strut.”

Richard Schiff, an actor from the NBC drama The West Wing visited Carnegie Mellon last Thursday to show his for presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
Emulating the political ardency of his character on The West Wing, Schiff inspired the crowd of Carnegie Mellon students gathered outside the Cohon Center’s Connan Room about the importance not only of registering to vote in Pennsylvania, but also the importance of educating your peers about this necessity. Not many students are aware of this, but as members of the Clinton Campaign mentioned before Schiff arrived, Allegheny County is the most important county in the most important state of this election.
Schiff is an active member of the Democratic Party and this isn’t the first political campaign he has participated in. As a friend of Joe Biden, Schiff spoke to many audiences during Biden’s Campaign, rallying West Wing fans to apply their love for the fictitious world of politics to real life by casting their ballots.
To those not aware of the cult-like following for The West Wing, it may appear strange that major politicians such as Biden and Clinton would seek out a pretend Director of Communications to support their campaign instead of a real-life political figure. This is because The West Wing told the story of an idealistic presidency free of corruption and extreme partisan tension that currently hinder real presidential campaigns. The legacy of the character Jed Bartlet’s time in office on The West Wing lives on as Americans still wish for a heroic and united team like that which existed on their TV screens. The show tells a story of a heroic and united American leadership. The internet presence of fandom for The West Wing has become increasingly popular in young generations. This is why Richard Schiff’s opinion matters to many students on college campuses, regardless of the fact that he is known for playing a role in a TV show.
By speaking about his own experiences as an adolescent, Schiff reminded the audience that it is possible to incite desired change within America, be it through the democratic process or civil disobedience. Just one year before Schiff was born, Rosa Parks became an icon of the Civil Rights movement by refusing to move to the back of the bus. This being the context of his childhood, Schiff explained that the changes he saw throughout the Civil Rights movement during his adolescence and young adulthood instilled in him an admiration for social activism. With this came a belief in the necessity of participating in our democracy to achieve reform.
Schiff regards the various freedoms given to American citizens as being very powerful. He explains “It almost feels like if we have the right, then we have an obligation to take advantage of it.” The most important thing that Schiff wanted the audience to take away from his speech was that it is essential to discuss the election with peers, explain to them what Hillary Clinton stands for, and make sure that they get out to the polls and vote on election day. Schiff stated that historically, when the Democratic party votes, they win. What is meant by this is that one of the biggest issues for the Democratic Party is not gaining support in their opinions, but in voter turnout on election day.
Following Schiff’s speech a local Clinton campaign representative spoke, further emphasizing the importance of getting involved in the campaign. It was highlighted that as of Thursday, Sept. 14, there were only 54 short days until the election. It was further stressed that there is an urgency for Clinton supporters to register to vote and begin a dialogue with those around them. It was also stressed how essential it is that members of the Democratic Party volunteer in any way that they can for the campaign.

Several Carnegie Mellon alums have been nominated for Emmy Awards
Several Carnegie Mellon alumni members were nominated for this year’s Creative Arts Emmy Awards. Among them was College of Fine Arts graduate Will Gossett (CFA ’15) who won a 2016 Creative Arts Emmy for Best Lighting Design/Lighting Direction. Gossett, and the rest of the lighting crew, won for his work as a lighting director for “Grease: Live.”
Mark Worthington, ’91, and Steve Arnold, ’89, were nominated against each other in the category of Outstanding Production Design for a Narrative Contemporary or Fantasy Program (One Hour or More). They were nominated for their work on American Horror Story: Hotel and House of Cards, respectively. The award ultimately went to the production designers of Game of Thrones.
Eugene Lee, ’62, was nominated for Outstanding Production Design for a Variety, Nonfiction, Reality Or Reality-Competition Series for his work on Saturday Night Live. Portlandia won this category this year.
Outside of the Creative Arts Emmys, 1970 graduate and two-time Daytime Emmy winner Judith Light has been nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her performance as Shelly Pfefferman in Transparent.
The 68th Primetime Emmy Awards  aired on Sept. 18 on ABC at 7 p.m. and was hosted by Jimmy Kimmel.
New Facebook Study shows that online interactions improve a person's mood
A new study conducted by Carnegie Mellon University and Facebook shows that personal interactions on Facebook have a positive impact on a person’s feelings. In particular, researchers say that personalized comments and posts from loved ones have been shown to solicit as much satisfaction from a person as getting married or having a baby.
Moira Burke, a Facebook research scientist and human-computer interaction PhD graduate, and Robert Kraut, a professor at Carnegie Mellon’s Human Computer Interaction Institute, conducted the three month-long study. The duo asked 1,910 Facebook users from 91 countries to take a monthly survey in which they were asked about their Facebook behavior. Burke and Kraut found that within a month, sixty comments from close friends affected one’s psychological well-being, concluding that Facebook interactions can increase satisfaction and happiness.
Burke and Kraut’s study does, however, contradict previous studies that have shown that time spent on social media is associated with a greater likelihood of loneliness and depression. Burke and Kraut’s study has shown that personal social media interactions help to combat said negative feelings, with Burke suggesting that these interactions help remind people of their loved ones and positive influences in their lives.
“We’re not talking about anything that’s particularly labor-intensive,” Burke said in a University press release. “This can be a comment that’s just a sentence or two. The important thing is that someone such as a close friend takes the time to personalize it. The content may be uplifting, and the mere act of communication reminds recipients of the meaningful relationships in their lives.”

Editor’s Note: Dominique Escando is the Cabinet Writer of The Student Government.
Last weekend Vaasavi Unnava (SBP), Aaron Gutierrez (SBVP), and  Arnelle Etienne, advocacy chair of the President’s Cabinet, hosted the first-ever Conference for Social Change at Carnegie Mellon. The event consisted of a grouping of discussions among selected moderators and student organization presidents that focused on prominent issues students face, such as race relations or civic engagement, for the goal of catalyzing ideas and initiatives to improve on-campus life.
Although one organization with the most creative initiative will receive a $2,000 reward at the end of the year, Vaasavi and Aaron hope each participating organization is able to find unique encouragement in knowing that they are helping create a better and safer campus for their friends, the following generations of their organization, and the entire Carnegie Mellon student body. From the perspective of Student Government, this conference was a beginning — the beginning of a year where students feel equally fulfilled with initiating and creating tangible change in how students approach Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence Prevention (SARVP) as they do when their Mousetrap Car finally works perfectly, or their poem leaves a room speechless. It’s the beginning of a year where we aren’t scared to reach out to a friend who is struggling under the premise that taking this initiative can possibly take up too much time. It’s the beginning of a redefinition of putting your heart in the work, where work doesn’t only mean research or classes.
Why were student organization leaders chosen? Organizations are the heart of the spirit of Carnegie Mellon. They’ve certainly done enough to earn that recognition by how they serve as microcosms of the varied interests and backgrounds of our students and introduce fun and extracurricular pride into our lives. Student organization presidents, in particular, have been chosen, usually by popular vote, to represent and lead their organizations to maintain and supersede their past successes. If Carnegie Mellon wishes to complete a particular goal, student organizations are the place to go.
What might be the most important question discussed at this event was: what is an initiative? Arnelle Etienne has defined it as “a [measurable] program or series of events created by a student organization for the purpose of creating change on campus,” which Aaron later expanded to “anything that has the purpose of advancing their chosen cause.” In these two definitions, two qualities stand out: choice and action. From RPG to business leadership to Booth & Buggy efforts, each of the many organizations on campus has such varied goals and activities, so it should be up to these organizations to define what need they will focus on and how they will create change on campus. Be it a speaker series, a drive, or anything else imaginable and productive, an initiative involves joint and repeated effort by members for something they care about that benefits the community. Vaasavi, Aaron, and Arnelle really look forward to seeing what’s possible, and knowing Carnegie Mellon students, those possibilities are limitless.

Editor’s note: this is part two of The Pragmatist’s Manifesto.This weekly column encourages civil discussion about politics in the U.S. Find previous installments @ thetartan.org. 
Welcome back! Last time we took a whirlwind tour of U.S. election history as I opened my defense of the two-party system. This week, we will analyze the evolution of our media outlets over the past two decades and discuss how we all can individually work to bridge our country’s partisan divide.
As the son of someone who works in the news media, I was raised listening to NPR. I was not particularly dependent on any television network for my information. And just like you, I experienced the mass expansion of the internet as I grew up. Since 2007, the number of internet users worldwide has tripled.
Carnegie Mellon students are too young to remember when there were only three channels on television: ABC, CBS, and NBC. They were staples in people’s everyday culture that provided news every evening. People did not listen to the news to reinforce their own opinions; they listened to the news to get the news.
Then came CNN. (For those of you who don’t watch TV, you probably have seen it in airports whether you like it or not.) The Cable News Network was founded in 1980 as a 24-hour news service. News, all the time. More news shows were created to fill time with the same stories. One of my favorite CNN spectacles was its coverage of the lost Malaysian Airline Flight 370; it constantly covered every little detail about it for weeks on end. CNN took an event that was a tragic loss of life and sucked its emotional value dry with overwhelming coverage; it ended up becoming incredibly boring.
Things began to change during the 1990s. FOX News and MSNBC were both created in 1996. Both politically lean far more drastically to either side; FOX being conservative, and MSNBC being liberal. Now viewers could choose which type of news they wanted to watch. If a Federalist chose to read a Federalist-leaning newspaper in 1793, he would probably reaffirm his own views. Due to the availability of television, the same principle applies here, except on a much larger scale.
Through the Bush and especially Obama years, as we will talk about in greater detail next column, partisan obstructionism led to more gridlock than actual governance. Many on either side of the divide chose the media that they agreed with most. The news reporting may be accurate, but when people do not watch or listen to sources that they disagree with, it reaffirms that their own opinion is the right one. This problem worsened with the rise of the internet.
As we know from last week, the two parties act as large umbrellas, with more extreme minority voices on both sides. With the rise of the internet over the last decade, these minorities created their own sources of online news. The progressive liberal show The Young Turks started broadcasting on YouTube in 2005. Things got even more extreme with the founding of the Breitbart News Network in 2007. Breitbart has been described as “conservative news” by other networks, but it often peddles conspiracy theories from the “alt-right” movement.
The omnipresence of the new media forces more traditional media like newspapers and cable TV news to adjust their strategies by pushing more flashy headlines and less substantive stories. This is one reason the GOP nominee in our current election got so much more momentum than people predicted. The TV networks could not help themselves every time the nominee said anything out of the ordinary, giving him over two billion dollars of free advertising instead of covering the candidates with, for example, actual plans. We will dive into this in far greater detail in our fourth installment.
When these large media outlets start to compromise the quality of their reporting, it allows others to create false stories that they can advertise as the truth. This comes from more partisan news sources, or even the politicians themselves. If a politician peddles the same narrative over and over, he sometimes can convince a group of people that opinion is actually fact. This is a typical political strategy, sure, but when online media sources verify the claim or other news sources do not challenge the claim, (ahem, Matt Lauer) people can start to believe these “facts,” and in some cases there can be dangerous consequences.
People no longer have to settle for one of the three nightly news shows of generations past. They can get their news whenever they want, with whichever spin they want. Those on the far right delight in Breitbart headlines, while Bernie Bros stay dedicated to The Young Turks. Both think they are completely in the right, and neither is willing to even try to talk about it.
This encourages an increase in the partisanship we have known for the past decade. Now I’m not saying that everyone in those organizations is a charlatan. In fact, sometimes people in the media on the other side of the political spectrum make points that I do not consider when forming my own arguments. And this brings me to my solution to our extreme partisanship in the era of modern media sources.
Listen.
Be challenged.
Seek out someone with whom you disagree, and ask them why they believe what they believe. There is often an argument that is more reasonable than you might expect.
When you open up a new tab for news, choose two differing outlets to gather several perspectives. Conservatives: Give MSNBC a chance now and again. And liberals: Even though you disagree with the Wall Street Journal editorial page, that does not mean it is always wrong. One of the beautiful things about our country is that so many people can have so many different opinions, and generally speaking, we can all hold these opinions openly. If we all read from news sources we don’t agree with, maybe we would be more willing to understand where our political opponents get their motivations. Perhaps we would be more willing to work with them and compromise to find solutions to our problems.
In a world where our presidential debates are being advertised as something along the lines of “Smackdown 2016: America Edition,” facts do not tend to matter. That simply would not be good for ratings. Facts can once again be valued if we as a nation can understand that maybe our opinions might not be totally right all the time after all. If we work to stem this tide in our own lives, we may find a return to the sanity of a pragmatic democracy again in our government.
Join me next time as we dive back into modern U.S. history and analyze how our two current parties have ended up so ideologically far apart, and how events 50 years ago put us on the track to the election campaign we have on our hands today.

Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among American people aged 25 to 34. Statistics show that about 1,100 American college students commit suicide every year, and one in ten American college students have made a plan for suicide. And the problem is only getting worse: the suicide rate among young adults aged 15 to 24 has tripled since the 1950s.
On March 29, 2016, two bright Carnegie Mellon students committed suicide, leaving those around them in astonishment and grief.
On a more personal note, one alumni from my high school and close friend of my many peers committed suicide in Feb. of this year.
Under this serious and crucial background, Carnegie Mellon enhanced its attention on mental health care by emphasizing its Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) program, bringing in mental health first-aid training days and activities such as Send Silence Packing, an exhibit of 1,100 backpacks that represent the college students who are lost to suicide every year, incorporating “Student Wellness” in most if not all class syllabi, establishing places like the Mindfulness Room. 
But what’s the effect? Few students make appointments with CaPS for fear of being regarded as “mentally ill,” which is still a stereotype regardless of how many times the university tells students that asking for help is a sign of strength. Every mental health first-aid training this semester is held on a weekday and takes eight hours, making it impossible for most students to attend, and these trainings target only mental illness and substance abuse, leaving a huge gap in coverage for mental problems that most people don’t regard as illnesses. Students seldom read the “Student Wellness” section of class syllabi because it just seems irrelevant, and few professors spend time reading that section, as opposed to hours spent on explaining grading criteria over and over again. Most of the time few students are in the Mindfulness Room, and those who do either lie on the cushion and fall asleep or bring their work with them into the room, completely missing the initiative of “recover and inspire yourself,” as stated on its website.
It may also be surprising that many students who committed suicide actually didn’t have symptoms of typical mental illness. Many are shocked when they hear that their extroverted, friendly acquaintances commit suicide, replying with, “I never thought this would happen to them” or “But they were so optimistic!” or “They were so good in everything! How was that even possible?” Why would these seemingly hope-of- tomorrow students make these decisions that affects not only themselves, but also those around them?
The answer, for me, is peer pressure. At Carnegie Mellon, as opposed to many other institutions, most of the students work really hard, and are afraid of being surpassed by their peers in dimensions like grades, workload, course difficulty, research, internship, job, salary, and more. For many, their “heart is in the work,” but few relate this motto to its context.
This world-famous motto by Andrew Carnegie was announced in his letter announcing his determinedness to contribute all his efforts to build this university. Contrary to our situation now, no one was there to rival him. His heart was in the work not to surpass or keep up with others, but because he really enjoyed what he was doing and what he would achieve by doing it.
For most of us, however, it’s all about competition. When we hear that someone around us is attending the career fair this week, we naturally rush there so that we won’t feel left out or beaten, even if the fair is totally meaningless and boring for us. We choose the hardest courses and vow to get the highest GPA in class. When we see others come up with an interesting project, we stay up late to think of a better one.
I’m certainly not discouraging this spirit: it’s what motivates us to progress. However, too much of it distorts our primary cause of doing what we like. Without passion about the work itself, the work may turn out to be a tiring chore that we’re forced to finish so that others won’t look down upon us. A friend of mine who is very interested in computer science complained to me the other day that, “Everybody else is just too bright. Most of them come with a deep computer science background, and many have already built apps themselves. I feel so intimidated by their intelligence,” then, “I’m now beginning to reconsider my choice of major. Is this really suitable for me?” A first-year math major told me that she had to stay up till 2 a.m. just to be the first one to submit a homework that’s due next week.
When I told my friends in other universities about this, they often found it difficult to imagine and understand, and I replied, “Well, that’s our campus culture. That’s why we earn the most salary after we graduate.” But now that I come to think more deeply about it, this may not be the best thing possible. Although colleges were primarily established to hold class meetings, college life has long since transformed. Building social relationships, discovering and discussing our personal values and passions, learning to think logically as well as creatively — all of these are essential for a meaningful college life. Prioritizing work can be good, but our lives certainly shouldn’t revolve around work.
Accompanying intense competition is the phenomenon of students avoiding admitting to having a problem. This includes students continuing to work when not feeling well, keeping questions to themselves to be solved later, not asking for help when anxious, and constantly worrying that their “mask” of perfection will be unveiled. This in turn leads to even more serious problems, and as problems internalize, they root deeper, finally becoming non-erasable and unchangeable.
How can the university help with this? Mental illness treatments such as the First-aid programs miss the huge scale of students who aren’t necessarily ill, but still possess psychological discomfort, and temporary relaxation, like the Mindfulness Room, Project Smile, which sets up days to show kindness, Paws to Relax, a program that invites animals such as dogs to interact with students, or Picnic on the Cut, which gives students free rental of picnic mats, don’t solve the core of the problem, or, in a Chinese saying, “solves the symptoms but not the disease.”
The root of the problem, peer pressure, lies in campus culture itself, so it’s hard to change. However, this doesn’t mean that there’s nothing to do. Administrators can help by offering to chat with students about their lives rather than immediately referring them to consultations or treatment with CaPS. Professors can help by encouraging teamwork in courses and activities by assigning team projects, encouraging presentations and discussions about students themselves through exercises and assignments, and encouraging students to explore their own fields of strength by providing various opportunities of research and activities. Students can help by kindly offering non-condescending help, asking our friends if they feel okay when we sense that they are down, and opening up discussions about them rather than us.
These steps may seem trivial, and are definitely not big changes such as the establishment of the Mindfulness Room, but remember, Rome wasn’t built in one day. True, this approach takes many more years to lay the foundation, but this slow shaping of campus culture is what will actually work to reduce student stress in the long term.
Having said this, I still appreciate the university’s effort at trying hard to mitigate the problem. All of us: administrators, professors, and students must work together to promote mental health for this institution as a whole. We can’t just sit there and hope for the best, or rely on only ourselves to make changes. We must stand up and create a better future together.

For the past few weeks, Donald Trump and the media have publicly speculated about Hillary Clinton’s health. Their speculation reached a fever pitch last Sunday when Clinton left a 9/11 memorial event early after feeling overheated and cell phone footage later showed her appearing to faint as she was escorted into her van. Now, a week later, the most recent polls have shown Clinton and Trump tied nationally, and Trump leads Clinton in the key swing states of Florida and Ohio. 
To be sure, Clinton’s drop in the polls is not due entirely to her pneumonia. She also had a bad week in terms of her basket of deplorable” gaffes, among other issues. But there should be no doubt that Clinton’s campaign has been badly hurt by her illness. The truly frustrating part of this for Clinton’s campaign is that this would be a much smaller story had Clinton just disclosed her illness to begin with. This is an ongoing pattern that Clinton must overcome to correct her course; instead of getting in front of potentially damaging stories, she shrouds herself in secrecy, ultimately making the story, when it gets out, seem much more scandalous.
In the case of her health, Clinton should have disclosed her pneumonia as soon as she was diagnosed with it, which was Friday, Sept. 9. Doing so would have at least two benefits. First, she would have quieted much of the preexisting speculation about her health, which often centered around coughing fits that would easily be explained by a pneumonia diagnosis. Second, had Clinton disclosed her pneumonia and then still attended the 9/11 memorial, she would have likely benefited from extra positive optics.
Instead, by hiding her pneumonia, Clinton let the speculation about her health rage on. She publicly exhibited signs of poor health that added to the fire, and she reinforced the narrative that she isn’t transparent with the American public. Now, many Americans worry that Clinton is neither healthy nor honest enough to serve as President.
Clinton’s desire for privacy, while understandable, has caused her campaign great harm, and is at the center of what makes her poll numbers so abysmal on the metric of “honest and trustworthy”.
The most haunting example for her campaign has been Clinton’s use of a private email server while working in the State Department. Clinton used such a server out of a desire to circumvent public disclosure laws, which would have required her to preserve every email she sent or received as Secretary of State for public record. Because of her affinity for secrecy, her email activity has blown up into a huge scandal that has become one of the defining issues of the campaign, and a persistent drag on her favorability.
Another example is Clinton’s aversion to press conferences. Because Clinton distrusts the press and believes that too much press exposure will lead to negative coverage, she went nine months without holding a press conference. She broke her silence only two weeks ago, holding a press conference for the first time since before any of the primary elections had even begun. Because she refused to hold press conferences for want of privacy, the press instead wrote negative stories about her refusing to speak to them. Once again, her desire for secrecy ended up creating an even bigger and more negative story than the one she was trying to avoid and reinforced an image of dishonesty.
This is not to say that Donald Trump is a bastion of honesty or transparency. For instance, he is the first presidential candidate since 1972 not to release his income tax returns, and he has been just as withholding on matters of his own health. There are clear signs of wrongdoing involved with his charitable foundation, and he has the lowest truthfulness rating on Politifact of any major political figure. However, this ultimately isn’t going to exonerate Clinton of the need to become more transparent. The sad reality is that the public views her as less honest, trustworthy, and transparent than Trump, and every gaffe, scandal, and lie hurts her politically far more than him.
We can, and should, cry foul about a media double standard. We can, and should, debate how much of the public’s greater distrust of Clinton is due to her gender. But with only seven weeks remaining in the election, Clinton must acknowledge the political hand she’s been dealt, and she must adjust. If she wants to defeat Donald Trump, (and we should all hope that she does!) she must become more transparent, or every small story she tries to hide will continue to become a monstrous issue that harms her wounded campaign.

Last Thursday morning, as I was walking up the steps of the College of Fine Arts, there was a row of backpacks lining the walkway in front of the building. Each of these backpacks had a piece of paper attached to the top of it, and these papers had pictures of college students and stories about their lives. There were backpacks of all different colors and brands, with logos from many universities across the United States, but the common factor between all these bags is that each one of them represented the life of a college student who had committed suicide.
I looked down the row of backpacks, unsure if I wanted to cry or throw up as I began to realize what they were. I then looked across the lawn and saw huge blue bags being unloaded from a truck and a team of students pulling backpacks out of these bags and placing them on the grass. There were hundreds and hundreds of backpacks, the stories of hundreds and hundreds of lives cut short being laid on the lawn in hopes of preventing another life, another backpack from joining those facing skywards on the grass.
This display was a touring exhibition known as “Send Silence Packing.” The exhibition is made up of 1,100 donated backpacks and has been displayed in over 100 cities in the United States since the project’s inception in 2008. Each year approximately 1,100 college students die as a result of suicide, and the backpacks represent the lives of these students. The backpacks are displayed on college campuses to raise awareness about mental health and “the incidence and impact of suicide.”
The program was brought to Carnegie Mellon by Active Minds, the campus chapter of the national organization which strives to diminish the stigma surrounding mental illness and health and spread awareness of these issues.
I am so grateful that this program was brought to our campus. Mental health is a taboo on this campus no matter how much people would like to deny it. Many students who need help don’t seek it out for a plethora of reasons, but one of the biggest is that they are afraid of admitting they need help in the first place. The fact that there is a stigma around mental illness is not the fault of any one person, organization, or corporation, but is a dangerous ideology that has become a part of our society, and one that is particularly prominent on college campuses.
Carnegie Mellon is a place where students will push themselves to their own personal limits and beyond to achieve success. Sleepless nights and course overloads with no lunch break are not uncommon. In fact, there is almost an unspoken expectation that you will be doing these things somewhere along the way. Although these circumstances are not necessarily the cause of mental illness, they certainly do not help the situation. It is easy to feel inadequate when you look around at all the amazing things your peers are doing. When students begin to feel inferior, overwhelmed, and under appreciated, matters are only made worse by the fact that stigmas surrounding mental health result in feelings of helplessness and loneliness. Suicide has become the number two cause of death of college students nationwide. The idea of putting one’s head in the sand and hoping a problem goes away has never been one that has worked, and taking this approach to mental illness puts human life in danger.
It is clear that students on this campus are trying to start a conversation about mental health. What is vital at this point is to join in that conversation. It is an issue that should be important to every single students because mental health is something every person struggles with in their own way.
“Send Silence Packing” is a heartbreaking exhibition with the intent of breaking down the walls that we have created surrounding the topic of mental health. Each life represented by a backpack on the lawn is a cry to remember the lives that have been lost and a reminder to take care of yourself and those around you.

Editor’s note: This weekly series highlights stories of women mentioned in the media. Find previous installments @ thetartan.org. 
A little less than two years ago an anonymous woman was sexually assaulted by Brock Turner, a former swimmer at Stanford University. This past June, a significant amount of media coverage was given to the case when Judge Aaron Persky sentenced Turner to serve a mere six months at Santa Clara County Jail, supported by the reasoning that a longer and harsher sentence would have a “severe impact” on Turner’s future given his age. On Sept. 2, 2016, three months after the start of Turner’s sentence, he was released early, having served just half of his criminally lenient sentence.
Turner has since returned home to Dayton, Ohio where he has to register as a sex offender for life, but he is a free man. Things seemed to have worked out better than Persky could have even hoped. A mere three months behind bars! That’s sure to mean an even less significant impact on Turner’s future. How nice for the both of them.
The biggest flaw with Judge Persky’s logic is that this case is not about what is best for the perpetrator. This case is about punishing and serving justice to a man who has committed a crime that will forever have asevere impact” on his victim. Turner’s best interests are not what should be at the forefront of his sentence.
The pain and suffering that Turner’s anonymous victim faced that night and in the many months following will remain with her for the rest of her life. But our legal system has told her that her anguish is only worth three months of discomfort for her rapist.
This woman made a choice to press rape charges against Brock Turner; a choice that many women don’t make because of how drawn out and painful this process can be. She made a choice to seek out justice. She had to struggle through more than a year of investigation and retell her story countless times to countless officials. Something like that does not get easier with time or repetition. Each instance of repetition is a stark and painful reminder of what has passed.
She understood how painful and long the process of accusing Turner through the legal system would be but she chose to do so in hopes that some sort of justice would be served. The United States legal system not only did her wrong, but also wronged the thousands of women who are victims of rape in the United States each year.
The letter that this incredibly strong woman wrote and read to her rapist in court made this case followed nationally. The conviction and sentencing of Brock Turner had the potential to serve as an example across the country of our nation’s intolerance to sexual abuse. Instead, it turned into a case highlighting corrupt judges and injustice in our legal system.
What cannot happen is for people to lose faith in the legal system and stop following sexual assault cases to their conclusion. Our country needs to make it clear that there is zero tolerance for rape, something it has not done well up to this point.
Men and women who are the survivors of rape must not be pushed to the wayside by our legal system. It goes against everything our legal system claims to stand for. It takes a lot of strength and courage to press charges of sexual assault, and there is no reason why this is something that should be made into an even more difficult and painful process by the court.

My younger sister has a tree nut allergy. For her, that means that eating cashews or almonds or pistachios does horrible things to her body. She throws up. She breaks out in hives. She goes into anaphylactic shock.
No one has ever accused her of faking her allergy to get out of eating foods she doesn’t like. No one has ever told her not to eat in a restaurant if she has to avoid certain items on the menu. No one has tried to coerce her into gradually exposing herself to the allergens she reacts to — while such treatment does work in many cases, it’s obvious that only doctors are qualified to make that call. No one claims that warnings placed on food labels to protect her limit what other people can consume.
Yet if we apply this scenario to mental health rather than physical health, we find ourselves in the middle of a vicious debate about trigger warnings. 
This discussion has become particularly prominent across college campuses recently as students and instructors struggle to foster an academic environment that is open as well as safe for all members of the community.
The University of Chicago started off the school year by informing new students that trigger warnings and other notices of sensitive material would not be used on the campus. The school believes that sheltering students from discomfort can be harmful in the long run, and cited a commitment to free speech and a belief in the importance of debate as their primary reasoning for this decision.
“Our commitment to academic freedom means that we do not support so-called ‘trigger warnings,’” Jay Ellison, the Dean of Students, stated in a letter to incoming freshmen. He continued, saying, “We do not cancel invited speakers because their topics might prove controversial, and we do not condone the creation of intellectual ‘safe spaces’ where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own.”
In response, over 150 faculty members of the university published a letter of their own, also addressed to the students. This letter, though it did not mention trigger warnings directly, did make a point to state that requests for such notices are often closely linked to “ongoing issues of bias, intolerance, and trauma that affect our intellectual exchanges.”
“To start a conversation by declaring that such requests are not worth making is an affront to the basic principles of liberal education and participatory democracy,” the faculty claimed. They encouraged students to speak out about their rights in order to create a space where they are best able to learn.
This thinking seems to fall in line with that of many other colleges throughout the country, including the University of California, Santa Barbara and Oberlin College, that have actually asked professors to include trigger warnings in their syllabi in order to alert students to uncomfortable material.
So are trigger warnings potentially dangerous to free speech, or is the University of Chicago making a misinformed decision that is threatening the mental health and comfort of their students? In reality, it may be a little of both.
It is unfortunate, but hard to deny that our culture’s use of the term “trigger warning” as a whole has spiraled out of control recently. In an opinion piece for The Guardian, Jill Filipovic identifies a danger in what she calls a “general trigger warning” — that, in listing every topic in a book or film that students may find uncomfortable, professors risk coloring reactions to the material as well as highlighting certain aspects as more impactful, just because they could be traumatic. 
Even worse is when professors simply remove mention of the triggering material. Instead of merely warning students so that they can prepare themselves, this reaction leans more toward protective censorship, which brings the flow and development of ideas to a halt.Some particularly devious students may even view the confusion surrounding the application of trigger warnings as a convenient way to get excused from an assignment without a negative effect on their grade.
But stopping the misuse of the term “trigger warning” and holding students accountable for their work is drastically different from failing to acknowledge the benefits that advanced notice of difficult topics may have for students who have recently suffered trauma. Because that is what trigger warnings were initially intended to do: to alert students that they will be faced with difficult material, so that they can mentally prepare themselves and arrive in control of the situation and ready to contribute. They don’t help you avoid something you don’t like. They don’t censor the speech of others. They protect people from discomfort, panic attacks, and worse reactions that come from being unprepared to face something that threatens their mental health.
That’s not to say that the University of Chicago doesn’t care about their students’ mental health. In all likelihood, the school’s understanding of the purpose of trigger warnings has been colored by the many inflated or just plain wrong applications that seem to pervade public discussion of late. 
But with a narrower definition in mind, there are people with genuine needs that must be respected, and the University of Chicago has done them a disservice by shutting down discussions about accommodations.
The simple truth is that trigger warnings are ultimately empowering to people who, for one reason or another, might suffer if taken off guard by a topic. The advance warning can help to prevent panic attacks, and can also allow students to speak to therapists or friends about the best way to handle the lesson. Instructors can even offer alternative readings or viewings for course material that involves a lot of sexual violence or other graphic material.
There are those who claim that people who might need trigger warnings don’t belong in college. “Real life doesn’t have trigger warnings,” some may say, “Students shouldn’t get away with being coddled,” but in real life, it’s actually relatively easy to avoid subjects that make you uneasy. If you’re terrified of jump scares, your friends probably won’t invite you on a trip to a haunted house. If the sight of blood makes you queasy, you can take comfort in the fact that movies and video games must have warnings that alert consumers to violent content.
College, on the other hand, is for many students a chance to push at boundaries, to take on difficult subjects and learn more about the world than you would be exposed to in your everyday life. With the proper application of trigger warnings, it should make conversations accessible for everyone who might have valuable insight. If trigger warnings are used to warn, not to censor, then all students will feel in control of course material, and campuses can remain both open to discussions and safe for their students.

In 1838, the Jesuit priests who ran what is now called Georgetown University sold off 272 slaves. The sale, estimated to be worth around $3.3 million in today’s dollars, helped to pay off the then struggling university’s debt. While something like this is obviously horrific by today’s standards, the size and circumstances of the sale made it controversial even at the time. 
The 272 people sold included women, children, and the elderly. Little to no concern was paid to the conditions the slaves were being sold into. Rev. Thomas F. Mulledy, then the president of Georgetown University, made promises that the slaves would be sold in such a way that no families would be separated, and that they’d be sold to plantations where they’d be allowed to continue their Christian faith. None of these promises were kept.
Recently, student protests have occurred on Georgetown’s campus about the sale. Students staged a sit-in outside the university president’s office, wanting to start a conversation on this specific issue and how the institution of slavery benefitted the school in general. Principal among their grievances was an on-campus building — Mulledy Hall, named after the ex-president who arranged the sale. These protests have compelled Georgetown University to revisit this dark chapter in its history. Alumni got involved as well, and the Georgetown Memory Project was set up to track down the descendants of the 272 sold. 
The university also removed the names of Mulledy and the Rev. William McSherry, another college president involved in the sale, from the buildings named after them. They have rechristened these buildings Freedom Hall and Remembrance Hall until more permanent names can be decided upon. 
Most importantly, however, the university has publicly apologized for the entire episode, and has offered preferential admissions treatment to the descendants of those slaves. In the process, Georgetown says its aim is to tackle its sordid history with slavery head on and start a conversation on this issue on college campuses across the country.
The public response to this apology has been decidedly mixed. On one side, Georgetown University has been praised for its humility and for attempting to trace the lineage of families that were separated centuries ago. On the other, the university has been criticized for missing the proverbial forest for the trees. While the move is a step in the right direction for the descendants of the 272 slaves directly concerned here, it completely sidesteps the larger issue of the university’s attitude towards slavery in the 19th century. Further, several of the slaves’ descendants and the protesting students have wondered why they hadn’t been included in the decision-making process. The apology was deemed meaningless, and the university has been accused of not following it up with any real action. 
If the issue is one of reconciliation and reparations, what does the university really sacrifice in an apology and a tweaked admissions policy?
It is The Tartan’s view that Georgetown University’s so called atonement for its 1838 sins is a step in the right direction; that being said, by isolating the descendants and protestors from the decision making process, the university is ignoring the very people it is trying to serve. As such, the apology and surrounding actions don’t go nearly as far as they need to. While these steps will probably succeed at starting a conversation around the issue of slavery reparations in general, it isn’t nearly enough. The lack of meaningful concrete steps will leave any amount of debate seeming hollow. Additionally, this case makes for an interesting study in how older universities around the country should respond to their checkered pasts regarding slavery, segregation, and racism.
The student activists and slave descendants have novel ideas for how reparations can be dealt with, but Georgetown isn’t currently paying enough attention. The student activists propose a new endowment fund that would equal the current value of the profit garnered from the 272 slaves in order to recruit black professors. This idea is ingenious in how it acknowledges the link between the horrors of 19th century slavery and racial injustice today. In the true spirit of reparations, it manages to provide tangible benefit without talking down to the afflicted communities. It successfully uses the case of the 272 slaves as a platform to tackle the issue of reparations for slavery at a much broader scale than what the university just announced.
Several of the slaves’ descendants are suggesting something that is far more radical. They are calling for a billion dollar reconciliation fund that they want Georgetown to spearhead the creation of. This move has been misunderstood and mocked across mainstream media, seeing as Georgetown’s entire endowment is worth approximately $1.5 billion dollars. The Tartan believes that this criticism is unwarranted, and found a number of very interesting ideas in the proposal. First and foremost, the reconciliation fund as it has been proposed isn’t limited to Georgetown. As a national fund, it addresses the issue of slavery reparations on the largest scale possible. Further, it draws virtually every major American university into the issue and would successfully start a conversation capable of being backed by large-scale action; This is something that Georgetown’s current plan cannot possibly hope to accomplish.
The next question, clearly, is where a university such as Carnegie Mellon, established after the abolition of slavery, belongs in this debate. Racism and oppression can take many forms, of which slavery is arguably the most horrific. Due to its age, Carnegie Mellon has had far fewer brushes with overt racism than a school such as Georgetown. 
What we must beware of, however, is to not use that fact as an excuse to evade this entire debate. The same problems, though not as severe, do afflict us as well. Even today, black people are an underrepresented community at Carnegie Mellon. There isn’t enough of a dialogue on race and its cultural meanings here. Our moral obligation to participate in this debate stems not from horrific past transgressions, but from the little things that have collectively resulted in a culture of apathy towards issues of race.
