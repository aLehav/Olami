In its penultimate game before the University Athletic Association (UAA) championships, the Carnegie Mellon women’s volleyball team built impressive momentum with a dominating win over Mount Aloysius College.
The Tartans won the first seven points and never relinquished their lead once they scored. In a great team effort, the Tartans took the Wednesday game in straight sets 25–9, 25–10, and 25–8.
On the second point of the game, first-year defensive specialist Molly Higgins made a save in a play that ended up being Mount Aloysius’s last chance to tie the score. 
With four aces and mistake-free play including eight digs, Higgins stood out among many strong performances from the Carnegie Mellon side.
She credited her success to the rest of the team. “As a defensive player, a lot of my play is supported by other players doing their jobs first,” she said.
“The block was really strong throughout the match, making it easy to read the opposing team’s offense. The setter was also reliable in getting to the ball every time I got a dig, making it possible for the point to continue,” she said.
Team captain and junior Ali Celentano echoed Higgins’s sentiments about the team’s strong performance. 
“It was really good to see everyone on the team step up. We played at the level we wanted to and weren’t slowed down by what was on the other side of the court,” Celentano said.
She expressed optimism for the rest of the season, saying, “Focusing on our side of the court has been the goal for us this season, and I think how well we did today could very well translate into our upcoming matches at [the UAA Championships].”
The team’s net play was extremely impressive. With a 59 percent kill percentage, the whole team was locked in at the net. Mount Aloysius also finished the game with zero blocks, showing just how dominant Carnegie Mellon’s attack was.
First-year opposite hitter Kristen Flint and senior outside hitter Senna Parsa had 10 kills each, while first-year middle blocker Jackie Gibbons contributed both offensively and defensively with six kills and four blocks.
The game itself never felt close. In addition to scoring the first seven points of the game, the Tartans scored nine of the first 13 points in the second set, and 11 of the final 12 points of the game. 
Each set was decided by at least 15 points, and the final score did not do justice to how strong a team performance the Tartans put on.
The Tartans kept their momentum going on Saturday, when they defeated Allegheny College in three sets. The two wins from last week improved their record to 23–8 for the season.
The team’s next and final challenge of the season is the UAA Championships held at Brandeis University this Friday.

On a chilly afternoon, the Carnegie Mellon football team lost its first conference game against Washington University in St. Louis last Saturday in Gesling Stadium.
Before the game, head coach Rich Lackner said that the Bears were a very balanced team. “I can’t point to any weaknesses on Wash. U.’s team,” he said.
In a low-scoring affair in which the Tartans found themselves leading for the majority of the game, the Bears managed to sneak away with a 9–7 victory with a long field goal in the waning seconds of the game.
After a slow start and finding themselves down 6–0 early in the first quarter, the Tartans drove 72 yards down the field in 11 plays to get on the scoreboard in the second quarter. Senior quarterback Rob Kalkstein found senior tight end Bryce Pardoe for a 7-yard touchdown pass for the Tartans.
The drive was spearheaded by a strong running game featuring senior fullback Zachary Erra-Hernandez, whose 27-yard scamper put the Tartans in a good field position to score on a touchdown a few plays later. After a successful extra point by sophomore kicker Connor Young, Carnegie Mellon took a 7–6 lead, and the momentum began to swing in their favor.
The game turned into a more defensive battle, however, as both teams exchanged punts until the halftime whistle. In the third quarter, an over-thrown ball by Washington quarterback Eric Daginella found itself in the hands of senior cornerback Liam McGrath for an interception, giving Carnegie Mellon the ball at its own 44-yard line.
Both teams committed costly turnovers, with the Bears committing four and the Tartans three.
Sophomore cornerback Vince Demarchi grabbed another interception of his own later in the third quarter; however, the Tartans were unable to convert the turnover into points.
Early in the fourth quarter, a fumble by sophomore running back Troy Witt on a punt return gave the Bears threatening field position at the Carnegie Mellon 17-yard line. 
Carnegie Mellon’s defense responded on the third down of Washington’s ensuing possession. Junior linebacker Alexander D’Angelo sacked Daginella and forced a fumble that was recovered by senior lineman Ryan Jok to prevent any further damage.
Each team kept a strong defensive presence for the rest of the game, and it seemed that the Tartans would walk away with a win.
With less than five minutes in the game, the Bears began a strong drive beginning at their 29-yard line. After a costly third-down penalty on D’Angelo extended their possession, the Bears found themselves at Carnegie Mellon’s 24-yard line with just over a minute remaining.
Instead of running the clock out, Washington elected to pass. The Tartans forced another turnover, as sophomore safety Malcolm Guya forced a fumble which was recovered by senior linebacker Akwasi Brefo.
With only 71 seconds left in the game, the Tartans needed to convert only one first down to seal the victory. But three Bears timeouts and a strong defense forced the Tartans to punt with 50 seconds remaining.
This time, Washington didn’t commit a turnover and methodically marched to the Carnegie Mellon 28-yard line with 15 seconds left.
Bears kicker Alex Hallwachs, who earlier missed a point-after attempt, redeemed himself with a 45-yard field goal to crush a valiant effort from the Tartans.
Despite the undesired result, the Tartans had many positives to take away and carry to the remaining games. 
“Guys just came out focused and ready to play a good football game…. Our intensity level was our strongest attribute,” Brefo said.
After dropping to 3–5 for the season, the team next plays an away game at the University of Chicago on Saturday at 1 p.m. The last home game of the season is at 6 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 16, which is also Senior Day.

After third-place finishes in the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships last year and a determined effort in the Carnegie Mellon Invitational four weeks ago, the men’s and women’s cross country teams looked poised to post impressive results in Saturday’s UAA Championships.
But on a chilly Saturday afternoon, both teams failed to carry the momentum from their successes in the Invitational that featured the same course in Schenley Park.
The men’s team finished fourth, while the women’s team took eighth place. Washington University in St. Louis, the No. 2 team in the nation, finished first in the men’s side, while the No. 9 University of Chicago took first in the women’s side.
Carnegie Mellon’s only top 10 finish was senior Josh Newby, who finished the the men’s 8k course with a time of 25:44.3.
“We had some good individual performances, but as a team we didn’t click,” head coach Dario Donatelli said. “At our conference level, with so many nationally ranked teams, you better be on, and we weren’t on as a team.”
Sophomore Rekha Schnepf finished first in the women’s 6k race at 27th place overall with a time of 23:17.3, and junior Erin Kiekhaefer, the team’s usual first-place finisher, came in at 32nd overall with a time of  23:27.1.
The University of Chicago had six runners finish within the top 20, and New York University, ranked No. 8 in the country and the second-place team in the Championships, had three runners finish in the top eight.
“I don’t think it was the best that we could have done,” Schnepf said.
The race was held on a cool fall day with strong gusts, so the weather could have been a factor in the team’s performances. However, Schnepf dismissed that possibility.
“We’ve run some other races that were pretty chilly, and we were fine. I think it’s just an accumulation from the season, and we were all more nervous,” Schnepf said.
Rounding out the rest of the women’s top five finishers were senior Catherine Paquette in 34th place. First-year Emily Joyce, and sophomore Priya Patel finished together in 38th and 39th place.
On the men’s side, while Newby led the charge, junior George Degen finished 13 seconds later in 15th place overall with a time of 25:57.5.
“The hills are tough on the last two miles ... but I think we all finished pretty well,” Newby said.
Senior Ken Murphy finished third on the team and in 30th place overall with a time of 26:34.2, and senior Brendan O’Hara and sophomore Marc-Daniel Julien took 35th and 36th place.
The team’s top five finishers, however, did not come close to Washington University in St. Louis, which had four runners finish within the top six. No. 7 New York University, finishing second, had three runners finish before Newby.
“We knew Wash. U. was going to be good. We knew NYU was going to be good. Hey, maybe we got a little wake-up call for our Regionals,” Donatelli said.
Both teams will have two weeks to prepare for their next challenge. They travel to Muhlenberg College on Nov. 16 for the NCAA Regionals, their penultimate meet of the season. Their final meet is the NCAA Championships on Nov. 23 at Hanover College.

The start of the NBA season got lost between the commotion of the World Series and the overwhelming attention-grabber that is the NFL.
With an off-season that saw more marquee players switching teams than any in recent memory, the NBA landscape is entirely different from the one last June when the Miami Heat won its second straight NBA title.
Most NBA teams have separated themselves into two categories for this upcoming season: Those who will tank in an attempt to get a high draft pick in next year’s draft and those who can win it all. 
The 2014 draft class has long been touted as one of the best since the 2003 class produced All-Stars LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, and Carmelo Anthony. Led by Canadian standout Andrew Wiggins, many teams see the next draft class as an opportunity to draft one of the game-changing talents necessary to win a title.
Many teams, such as the Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics, have traded many of their top players for draft picks and cap space. 
The demarcation between the tankers and the winners has actually caused many to question the integrity of a sport that condones these sort of fire sale seasons.
Basketball has dealt with these issues before when the Houston Rockets were accused of intentionally losing to get a better pick in the 1984 draft. To discourage teams from purposefully losing, the NBA implemented a weighted lottery to determine the top three picks. The teams with the worst records had the highest chances of getting the number one overall pick.
The Miami Heat were actually one of the few contenders that stood pat during the off-season, being hamstrung by the massive contracts of James, Bosh, and Wade. Their one major acquisition was signing former first overall draft pick Greg Oden. Oden has suffered knee problems since entering the league and hasn’t played since the 2009–10 season, but Miami hopes he can stay healthy and provide the team with the large inside presence it has been missing.
The Celtics, who just last season were playing the Heat for a chance to win a trip to the finals, underwent the largest dismantling effort. With former Big Three member Ray Allen going to the Heat the previous season, Boston blew up the rest of its nucleus that won a title in 2008 and earned a finals trip in 2010. 
All-Star forwards Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce were traded to the Brooklyn Nets as part of a massive blockbuster trade that unloaded some of the Nets’ overpriced bench players onto the Celtics along with first-round picks in 2014, 2016, and 2018. Coach Doc Rivers was also released from his contract and allowed to sign with the Los Angeles Clippers, leaving young point guard Rajon Rondo as the last beacon from the Celtics’ title days. Boston replaced Rivers with former Butler University coach Brad Stevens.
The other major domino in free agency was former Orlando Magic and Los Angeles Laker center Dwight Howard. After a nearly two-year saga with Howard trying to make up his mind where he wanted to play, Howard finally chose to sign a long-term deal with the Houston Rockets, joining rising star James Harden and former New York Knicks sensation Jeremy Lin. 
The Atlanta Hawks, Dallas Mavericks, Golden State Warriors, and the Lakers were all holding out hope that they would land Howard and had to quickly formulate a Plan B.
The Hawks lost their own major free agent, forward Josh Smith, to the Detroit Pistons and only had restricted free agent Jeff Teague left to try and build a team around, missing out on most of the better free agents.
After winning the 2011 title, the Mavericks gutted their roster, letting their defensive anchor Tyson Chandler walk in free agency as they attempted to clear up cap space to land a bigger free agent. They hoped to sign point guards Deron Williams or Chris Paul as well as Howard, but all players signed elsewhere. During the offseason, the Mavericks were left to sign two high-level guards in José Calderón and Monta Ellis to try and get longtime All-Star Dirk Nowitzki another championship ring.
The Golden State Warriors, who surprised everyone by taking the San Antonio Spurs to six games in the Western Conference Semifinals, signed former Denver Nuggets forward Andre Iguodala to firm up their defense. At the same time, the Warriors were unable to re-sign former backup point guard Jarrett Jack and forward Carl Landry, key players from last year’s bench.
The perennial powerhouse Lakers suffered the largest blow by losing Howard. While he was trouble in the locker room, he represented the future franchise players with Kobe Bryant on the decline recovering from a torn Achilles and playing in his 18th season. They are finally giving up their position at the top of the Western Conference and can no longer lay claim to being the best team in their home arena, with the Staples Center being shared with the significantly better Clippers.
This NBA season will be unusual to watch, to say the least. Expect many blowouts as the difference between the intentional winners and losers has led to a massive talent gap. What may ultimately decide who’s still playing in June, however, will be how well each contender integrates its new acquisitions and how well these acquisitions will mesh into each team.

Both Carnegie Mellon’s men’s and women’s soccer teams continued competitive conference play over the weekend.
On Friday, both teams traveled to Case Western Reserve University and came away with victories. The men’s team won 4–2, and the women’s side won 1–0.
After their victories, the teams traveled to the University of Rochester for a Sunday clash. The men’s team drew 0–0, and the women’s side lost 2–3 in double overtime.
“Of course, we would have liked to have gotten two wins,” senior defender Ben Bryant said. “But we’re happy getting four points. It definitely beats one win and one loss.”
Though the men’s Case Western game ended with a lopsided score, the game was much closer. The Tartans trailed 1–2 at halftime after all three goals were scored within the last two minutes of the first half.
The Tartans charged back in the second half. Sophomore midfielder Connor Webb scored two minutes into the second half off of a free kick by senior defender Cole Christensen. Senior forward Max Tassano headed in a goal in the 51st minute for the clincher.
Against the No. 14 University of Rochester, the Tartans played a tough, physical game. The Tartans received four yellow cards, while Rochester received three.
“The Rochester game showed that our defense can get organized, and we can sustain a lot of pressure from good teams,” Bryant said.
Facing 19 shots, senior goalie Christopher Madden made six saves.
“[Madden] came up big, with big-time saves,” Bryant said.
Carnegie Mellon’s women’s squad also started off the weekend road trip with a win against Case Western, with senior forward Alex Venegas’s first-half goal holding up as the only score of the game.
“We’re happy with the win on Friday, but we’re still disappointed with [Sunday’s] result,” said graduate student goalkeeper Anna Albi.
In Rochester, the women’s squad started strong. Sophomore midfielder Carson Quiros headed in a goal off a corner kick in the seventh minute.
After Rochester equalized in the 18th minute, the Tartans responded. Junior midfielder Jordyn Greenberg headed in the Tartans’ second goal for a 2–1 lead.
Rochester attempted only two corner kicks in the game, but made one of them count. With less than a minute in the first half, Rochester’s Kim Stagg scored off of their first corner in the game.
The game remained tied at two until double overtime, when Rochester’s Jessica Smith scored the decisive goal in the 107th minute.
“We were definitely the more dangerous team today, but we were just unlucky,” Albi said.
Both teams head on the road for their last regular season game this Saturday against Emory University.

When most people hear “Tiramisu,” they think of the delicious, coffee-flavored pastry. But it turns out that tiramisu is actually Italian for “pick-me-up,” which is why Carnegie Mellon’s Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center (RERC) on Accessible Public Transportation developed a bus rider information app called Tiramisu Transit with a $4.6 million, five-year grant. This grant has recently been renewed, giving the researchers and their collaborators at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York (UB) an additional five years to continue their research on accessible transportation.
At any given time, there are about 15–20 different RERCs around the country focusing on different topics. They are funded from within the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR), a research and development unit in the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, which is within the Department of Education.
“Some of the RERCs are on things that are really traditional to the whole issue of education, you know — workplace accommodations, systems to help with augmented communication, projects related to blindness and deafness — that sort of thing,” said Aaron Steinfeld, the principal investigator of the accessible transportation RERC and associate research professor in the Robotics Institute. He works in the Quality of Life Technology Center (QoLT) at Carnegie Mellon. So where does transportation come in?
According to the Department of Education, the main mission of all RERCs is “to solve rehabilitation problems and remove environmental barriers.” Accessible transportation is a key component to achieving this mission because all effort spent on educating individuals with disabilities and improving their workplace environments is useless if they cannot go to school or work in the first place. 
“Our focus is very much skewed towards independent mobility around your community. We’re heavily focused on public transit and getting to public transit,” Steinfeld said. Their focus on public transit is due to how expensive the alternative, paratransit, tends to be.
The collaboration between Carnegie Mellon and UB brings together a very interdisciplinary group of researchers. The Carnegie Mellon team consists mainly of people in the Robotics Institute, the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, the Institute for Software Research, and some members from the School of Design. On the other hand, the team at UB — which is actually led by Steinfeld’s father, Edward Steinfeld — consists of people in architecture, design, and industrial engineering.
Tiramisu Transit, a rider information app that was developed during the first five-year RERC, is a good example of this mixture of computer science and universal design. The app utilizes crowdsourcing to gather information such as when and where buses are and how full they are. “Most of the people who use it don’t realize that the design of Tiramisu and the information we’re attempting to gather with it is information that is really critical for people with disabilities,” Steinfeld said. 
This is the basis of universal design. “By packaging it in a way that makes the information appealing and valuable to everybody, we lead to more people using it and greater opportunities for the system to sustain itself beyond research and development,” he said.
While all riders are interested in knowing when a bus will come or how full it will be, this type of information is particularly important for riders with disabilities. For example, someone in a wheelchair would only be able to ride a bus with fewer riders. More generally, this app will also help those who cannot wait outside for long periods of time due to potential crime in the area or poor weather conditions and want to know when the next bus will come.
Until recently, the Port Authority of Allegheny County did not have the ability to track buses. While they had GPS on some of the buses, they were unable to communicate that location back to the servers and then share the location to the public. The Port Authority is now testing this capability on one of its routes and will be aiming to extend it to the rest of the agency. The RERC plans to use this new data.
“In the next five years, we will use Tiramisu to explore certain research questions related to the impact of this information on people with disabilities,” Steinfeld said. They are also in the process of adding dialogue capability within the app so that people will be able to attach messages to specific buses and stops. 
Other plans for the new RERC include working with the Traffic21 program at Carnegie Mellon to combine Tiramisu with real-time optimization of paratransit systems and working with the researchers who developed NavPal, which helps blind people navigate through Pittsburgh.
Correction: This article previously stated that the Port Authority tested their GPS system as part of the RERC on Accessible Public Transportation. A correction has been made to clarify that while the Port Authority did recently improve their GPS system, the RERC is not involved in the process or deployment of the new tracking system; it simply plans to use their data.

Brainwashing and thought control have had an impact on a variety of people and cultures throughout history, and can be traced all the way back to the fourth century BCE.
Brainwashing is the process of forcing people to fundamentally change their beliefs. Despite the fact that brainwashing is an age-old idea, it has taken on a new meaning in today’s society with advancements in neuroscience: Scientists are now able to — at least partially — understand brainwashing techniques and their effects.
A person’s brain is not fixed but is continually changing, sometimes in imperceptable ways. In the past, people assumed that once they mature, their brains — and thus their identities — could not dramatically change.
According to Kathleen Taylor in her book Brainwashing: The Science of Thought Control, this older theory generally did not support the idea of brainwashing, as it would require people’s identities to completely shatter in order  to work. Recently, however, it has become clear that the brain constantly takes in information and alters the way it functions.
The brain, along with all   the nerves in the body, is made of cells called neurons that are capable of sending signals to each other. Each of these neurons receives a multitude of signals that help develop one’s personality and perceptions of the world. 
Neurons can then further send off signals in response to those they receive. Through analyzing past input and output signals, the brain can predict the immediate future and then compare its prediction with what actually occurs. In this way, the brain learns from the past and more accurately understands how to react to stimuli.
One of the main implications of this view of the brain is the ability of one person to have more than one persona. The brain changes and reacts differently to different situations, so a person accordingly reacts differently in different circumstances. 
For example, the way someone acts in a job interview is generally very different from the way that person acts at home. These different personae are often called schemata, and are only activated under certain circumstances. This means that a person can have dormant schemata, and that they can create new ones. The presence of multiple schemata makes the idea of brainwashing much more plausible. In order to be brainwashed, a person only needs to have a dormant schema activated or have a new schema created, rather than have their entire persona modified.
Schemata can also refer to the brain’s recognition of certain objects. Both the input and output signals in a neuron are extremely specific, meaning that the representation of a single object in the brain is created by a group of neurons, not by any single neuron. As a person experiences an object, they develop a schema for that object. This schema includes everything related to the object, including visual appearance, sounds, related emotions, and related actions.
Now the question becomes, how is the strength of the schemata determined? The more these schemata activate, the stronger they become. This explains why people become used to things that they experience on a regular basis. In order for brainwashing to occur, the relative strength of the schemata must be altered. This is done by manipulating a person’s emotions, their brain’s aptitude for change and stress, and their prefrontal cortex.
Taylor explains that evolutionary biologists believe emotion is used for survival, and is meant to suffice when there is not time to fully process information. Because of this, emotion is generally not coupled with logical reasoning. This has the potential to lead people to strengthen schemata that they do not generally activate.
The brain’s aptitude for change and stress can also affect schemata. Neurons work best when they receive varied stimuli, and can become dormant otherwise. When a person is initially stressed, neurons recognize the change and become more alert. When stress persists, however, the neurons become overworked and ignore incoming signals. Because of this, people are more likely to abandon their preferred schemata when under stress.
Finally, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) can affect schemata. The PFC is the part of the brain that allows a person to stop and think before acting. Taylor says that the PFC shuts down when it is activated and then overstimulated with information. Once the PFC has shut down, a person is no longer able to think before acting, which can lead to the acceptance of a previously disapproved schema.
The science of brainwashing is a topic that is inextricably linked to many aspects of our society, including the integration of technology in society and advertisement, and could greatly affect the way society functions as we learn more about the way the brain operates.

Scientists aim to stop development of ‘superbugs’
According to a study conducted last month by the Centers for Disease Control, antibiotics continue to be overused and overprescribed. This has contributed to the development of “superbugs.” In fact, a recent epidemic at the National Institutes of Health took six months to control.  Despite this, pharmaceutical companies have scaled down research into the production of new infection-fighting drugs due to the narrow profit margin. As a result, the Department of Health committed to provide the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline up to $200 million over the next five years for research.

Robots becoming more human-like and autonomous
Recent scientific efforts aim to enable robots to begin collaborating with humans and operating without direct human control. Current goals in the field of robotics include making robots more “human shaped” to enable them to more gracefully maneuver human environments, and developing algorithms to make robots more aware of their environments and less dependent on direct control.
Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have developed a robot which can sense forces on its arm and ultimately may serve as an aid for physical therapy patients.

Study shows video games improve various functions
According to a study conducted at Max Planck Institute for Human Development and Charité University Medicine St. Hedwig-Krankenhaus in Berlin, playing video games can enhance brain functions such as memory formation, strategic planning, spatial orientation, and fine motor skills. The study involved two groups: One played video games for 30 minutes a day for two months, and the control group did not play any games. An increase in brain matter — specifically in the right hippocampus, right prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum — was observed in those who played video games.

Startup develops 3-D printer for consumer market
Pirate3D, a startup in Singapore, is developing an inexpensive 3-D printer for the consumer market that is scheduled to be sold starting in December. The printer will be available online and at certain retail outlets. It will be displayed at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January. The printer is available in both black and white and color, but not much detail is available yet on how it works.
The company also hopes to profit by creating ways for independent developers to sell software and designs for 3-D printers. The company was able to raise $1.4 million on KickStarter in less than one month, which according to co-founder Roger Chang should last for the next year. The printers will sell for $700 in stores and $500 online.

Antarctic reserve receives frigid reception
Negotiations held in Australia regarding the creation of a 500,000-square-mile marine reserve in the waters off  Antarctica failed this week. The reserve was proposed by the United States and New Zealand, and was to be built in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica. Though the area’s ecosystem helps sustain thousands of species, the construction of the reserve faced opposition by China, Ukraine, and Russia due to concern that it would cut off their fish stocks and undermine their fishing industries. Aquatic life in Antarctic waters account for 10 percent of the fish population, and a number of these scientists urge taking measures to protect them. China indicated that it may be open to a future agreement, while Russia and Ukraine still question justification for the reserve.

Students develop device to stop school shootings
A group of students from Benjamin Banneker Academic High School in Washington, D.C. have attempted to address the prevention of school  shootings. The 10-student team, led by math teacher John Mahoney, developed DeadStop, an inexpensive, lightweight device that clasps onto the hinges of classroom doors to stop intruders from breaking into classrooms. Due to school safety regulations, schools cannot have doors which lock from the inside. DeadStop would be stored in the teacher’s desk, and would be clasped onto the door as soon as a warning of an armed intruder was issued. The group hopes to patent the device and have it cost no more than $15.

Everyone has favorite and least favorite seasons. For me, winter is certainly my least favorite, mostly due to the hassle of determining what to wear each morning. Not only do I have to worry about looking presentable, I also have to stay warm. I find myself repeating the same outfit combination of leggings, a sweater, and boots every day because it’s quick and comfortable — but that’s become stale.
Fortunately, I’ve discovered a couple methods to alleviate this problem. You can read them below in this comprehensive guide to dressing for cold weather.
Outerwear
Let’s start with outerwear. You have a lot of options, but depending on the situation, some are more appropriate than others. For nice, crisp fall weather, choose a classic denim jacket. These look great layered over anything from a patterned dress to leggings and a trendy shirt. Avoid wearing jeans with your denim jacket; the denim on denim look could make you look too much like a cowboy. Leather jackets are another fall staple.
Slightly colder weather calls for a thicker jacket, like the very trendy military jacket. It seems like the military jacket may even have replaced the denim jacket as a fall wardrobe staple — you’ll see them everywhere you look. Layer yours over a sweater to stay warm.
Windbreakers are also pretty common, and as the name suggests, they’re the best for those days that are windy, rainy, or just plain gross. If you’re planning to buy one, get one with a hood to protect yourself from the rain.
When it becomes inhumanly cold outside and you have to walk to class, it’s time to bring out the puffy jacket. While these jackets may not be the most flattering, at this point, warmth should be your top priority. Accessorize with a cute hat or head wrap to keep your ears warm, as well as gloves and a thick winter scarf.
For more formal occasions, blazers are a great way to dress up an outfit when it isn’t too cold out. Try wearing one over a nicer top, with jeans and boots for a chic look. Pea coats are also appropriate for dressier events. You can pair a pea coat with a dress, tights, and heels for a polished look.
Sweaters
Now that you’re an expert on which type of jackets to wear and when to wear them, we can move on to the shirts, sweaters, and cardigans category. Generally, when choosing an outfit in the morning, the first item of clothing that comes to mind is the most comfortable — leggings. Then I face the struggle of finding a sweater I haven’t worn in the past couple of days that’s also long enough to wear with leggings. Sound familiar? Well, here are a few tips to help you deal with this problem.
It’s always good to have a lot of comfortable sweaters, but think about adding variety next time you shop. A close relative of the comfortable, oversized sweater is the sweater dress. You can wear it with leggings or tights and boots and it’s basically a new version of your old go-to outfit. If you have any longer cardigans, layer those over longer shirts as well.
In terms of cardigans, everyone should own at least three. I recommend black, gray, and tan as the bare minimum. Colors are always good to have, but neutrals are the top priority since they can be worn over anything.
Tops
Tops are the main way to add variety to your outfits, so make sure they’re interesting. You should definitely have a couple of basics to build off of, but try to find shirts that have some color, detail, or anything else that’s unique. You also want to look for shirts of different lengths and materials, so that you can wear them with either leggings or jeans. Lately, people have been wearing edgier shirts with studs and cutouts. At the same time, many stores have been featuring T-shirts with animals printed on them — another major trend — as well as tops with beaded necklines. Get long-sleeved versions of these to keep warm, or if yours has shorter sleeves, wear it with a cardigan.
Bottoms
Bottoms can be another issue in winter weather. When it’s warm out, it’s easy to just throw on a pair of shorts; you don’t risk each outfit looking the same, since shorts come in a variety of styles and colors. However, it’s easy to feel repetitive as it gets colder and you find yourself alternating between jeans and black leggings.
From blue jeans and black leggings, the obvious step up is to wear printed versions of either of these. Recently, the range of styles of printed jeans and leggings has significantly broadened to those with cutouts, leather panels, and more. Colored denim has been in style for a while and is a great way to add interest to your look. Colored jeans look best paired with a neutral-colored top. Floral leggings have been in style for while and seem to be here to stay, as well as Aztec print.
However, there are alternatives to jeans and leggings, such as corduroys. Now, I know what you’re thinking: They’re old-man pants. At least, that’s what I thought when I first heard that Free People clothing store was introducing them a few years ago — but the floral and plaid prints completely changed my mind. Free People also sells solid-colored corduroy pants, and other stores have similar items.
If you feel like dressing up a little, wear a skirt with tights. To class, you could wear this with a cardigan and boots, or if you have a special event to attend, complete the look with a nice shirt and heels.
Jewelry
My last tip is to accessorize with jewelry to vary your outfits. A chunky necklace can make last week’s plain sweater look completely different. The same can be done with a pair of statement earrings. The key is to mix and match to create a whole new wardrobe for winter.

There comes a moment in life when things begin to feel as if they are slowly losing meaning, as things you once thought you understood — things you thought you loved — slip away.
Last Friday, Quantum Theatre opened the play Parlour Song, featuring School of Drama professor Cameron Knight. Instead of the theater’s East Liberty venue, the play is staged at the former Pittsburgh Burger Company location in Homestead, adapted specially for this production and lending itself to an untraditional and intimate performance setup.
Set in middle-class suburbia outside London, the play revolves around the lives of three characters: Ned (played by Knight), his friend and neighbor Dale (Brendan McMahon), and Ned’s wife Joy (Sarah Silk).
Ned is a demolition expert, literally blowing up old things to make room for the new on a daily basis. Yet in his personal life, he seems to do just the opposite, trying as hard as he can to preserve his marriage and his life.
In the couple’s first scene, a desperately eager-to-please Ned tries to enthuse his passive-aggressive wife by offering her more and more food and stories, all of which she rejects, unwilling to engage with her husband. Opposite Ned’s desperate attempts to find meaning in his life is his best friend Dale’s ability to live in the moment. Dale’s humor cuts through the tension created by Ned and Joy’s complicated relationship, but McMahon’s portrayal gives Dale depth in his own right.
The play deals with themes of dissatisfaction, the impermanence of life within time, and a fascination with the power of destruction. As Ned’s possessions all mysteriously begin disappearing from his home, the man who destroys things for a living begins to have nightmares of his life itself evaporating away. It becomes not the objects themselves that are important, but rather the symbolism of losing all the little parts of your life until you have nothing. Objects become symbolic of moments in time, in a world where relationships are impermanent and life is unstable overall.
The acting captures the intensity of ordinary yet profound dilemmas. Each of the three actors carries equal weight, creating a dynamic in the room that makes the simple script profound: Knight’s enactment of a man desperate to preserve the past, McMahon’s ability to balance Dale’s infectious humor but still come off as a dynamic character, and Silk’s stunning, emotionally charged performance of a woman trapped in her own life, searching for a way out. There are moments when we feel as if we’re inside the minds of all three characters. Even if everything that has happened isn’t fully understood, we feel fully immersed in their world.
What makes this play so engaging is that even as it deals directly with increasingly dark themes, the dialogue between the characters stays realistic. There is the sense that in spite of the characters’ urgency and desperation, these scenes are ordinary moments in time. This effect makes the piece all the more relatable, making viewers question the meaning in their own lives.
In addition to the dynamic acting, the tension in the play is created through the use of echoing music and dim spotlights. The stage and audience are undivided, making the stage feel a part of reality. Projected words, phrases, and images are used to comment on the action in between scenes. When the play ends, there is an intimate energy left over in the room, as the bedside lamp stays dimly lit. The scene created the illusion that although the actors had left, the set still carried the longing, anger, and confusion of the story.
Parlour Song will run through Nov. 24 in Homestead.

If you’re seriously considering a career as an astronaut, you shouldn’t see Gravity. If you’re looking for an intense psychological thriller with dazzling special effects, you absolutely should.
Alfonso Cuarón’s Gravity is only 91 minutes long, but it seems longer. Once the action picks up — about five minutes into the movie — it grips you and doesn’t let go until the very end, alternating between long stretches of terror and rare moments of relief. You’ll be breathing almost as hard as mission specialist Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), forgetting you’re safely grounded on Earth, rather than out in space and losing oxygen with every gasp.
The film follows two American astronauts forced to improvise for their survival when their spacecraft is hit by flying debris, sending them tumbling into space. Their luck is both devastatingly bad and absurdly good at different times, and at certain moments, these astronauts are literally holding on by the tips of their fingers.
The characters are pigeonholed into their stereotypes very early on: Stone is the inexperienced genius doctor on her first space mission, while Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) is a chatterbox veteran astronaut who keeps his cool under pressure.
In fact, with everything else going on, it’s easy to overlook that the characters are remarkably flat and rely largely on established schemata. Bullock’s character hints at a tragic past, but even that story is barely fleshed out. The lack of complexity is likely a strategic choice — a shortcut to get to the action faster, rather than wading through slower scenes to establish story. Whatever the reason, this lack of character development inevitably makes the protagonists less compelling — perhaps a necessary sacrifice for the pace of the film.
Character development aside, Gravity is most impressive as a visual experience. For this reason, it should almost exclusively be seen in theaters. Above anything else, the movie is characterized by its stunningly sharp photography. During a few of the slower-paced scenes, we have time to zoom out and gaze at dazzling views of the Earth’s surface through its swirling atmosphere. The film does a brilliant job of planting the viewer in outer space; it’s easy to understand how beautiful and expansive, yet also terrifying and unforgiving, the universe must seem to these astronauts.
These views are accompanied by a minimal music score — a pulsing bass that increases in tempo as tension rises. The score suits the film’s clean aesthetic and simple, driving plot, but even more notable than the film’s use of music is its use of silence. At points, the pulse drops out, leaving both viewers and characters in nail-biting silence, reminding us how very alone the astronauts are in their struggle to survive.
Gravity is an immersive experience on all levels, visually and psychologically. You’ll leave the theater awed, in both good and bad ways. The film reminds us that the universe is a beautiful and wondrous place, but as Stone eloquently puts it during one of the film’s rare comedic moments, “I hate space.”

Few things are as dear to Western Pennsylvanians as the 1968 horror film, Night of the Living Dead, filmed in Evans City, Pa., by horror movie pioneer and Carnegie Institute of Technology alumnus George A. Romero. Stephen Catanzarite (DC ’90) combined his love for the film with his creative writing background to create Night of the Living Dead: The Opera.
On Tuesday evening, students and faculty members gathered in the Gladys Schmidt Creative Writing Center in Baker Hall for an intimate conversation with Catanzarite about writing and working as a Carnegie Mellon graduate. Sigma Tau Delta, the international English honor society, organized the talk.
“I didn’t know what I was going to do,” Catanzarite said of his career path after graduation. He first began writing for industrial videos, but eventually became the founder of two charter schools that emphasize the arts in education.
It was a combination of chance meetings and Hollywood connections that led to Catanzarite penning the libretto for an opera. It was originally proposed to him as a Broadway musical, but Catanzarite thought the inherently campy nature of musicals would ruin the story. He took his job very seriously, wanting to pay homage to the genius of the film, rather than entertaining for entertaining’s sake. The opera stays true to its source material, following seven people trapped in a farmhouse during a zombie attack.
So yes, the zombies sing — but the catch is that they can only communicate as a group, representing what Catanzarite describes as a “voice or consciousness in numbers.” The team behind the production also kept it rooted in Western Pennsylvania, throwing in small references to places or people familiar to the area and even some Pittsburghese.
Catanzarite wasn’t the only member of the Carnegie Mellon community involved in the production. Andres Cladera (CFA ’03) and Erica Olden (CFA ’97, ’01) are the co-founders of The Microscopic Opera Company, which is putting on the show. Gregory Lehane, a Carnegie Mellon professor of drama, directed the production, and Britton Mauk (CFA ’13) is the scenic designer.
Catanzarite’s passion for the project was obvious just by how much he had to say. Although the subject of his talk was writing in general, the conversation kept coming back to the production. He also talked at length about his time at Carnegie Mellon and how much it prepared him for writing the opera. Catanzarite showed Dietrich students that their training in the humanities can be expanded in strange but productive ways.
The gathering of people was small, but that atmosphere lent itself to the conversational nature of Catanzarite’s talk, as students and faculty interrupted to clarify or ask questions, or even to crack a joke.
After talking about his accomplishments for an hour, Catanzarite jokingly asked, “Am I a distinguished alumni yet?”
The world premiere of Night of the Living Dead: The Opera ran from Oct. 31 through Nov. 3 at the Kelly Strayhorn Theater in the Penn Avenue Arts District.

Indie folk-rock band Alpenglow visited Pittsburgh for the first time last Wednesday to perform at the Underground. The Vermont-based group has been building a fan base with live performances across the country and is currently touring with Brooklyn-based indie pop band Lucius, while promoting the release of its new EP Solitude. Lucius, the original headliner for the show, ended up canceling its gig due to medical reasons.
The concert started 10 minutes late, but once it started, the audience was immediately taken by the charm and originality of Alpenglow’s music. In front of a crowd of around 20 people, the band performed a set of 10 songs, many of which were new and unreleased. The group performed “The Following,” a slow song about love, and followed with the more upbeat “Gabriel.”
Alpenglow continued with “Drone,” “Shout it Out,” and “Solitude,” the last of which belongs to the band’s EP. The set covered fast songs and slow songs in no particular order, but the energy was so high that the audience was engaged every step of the way. The band went on to perform a love song, “Eliza,” followed by “Border Lines” and “Been So Long.”
Toward the end, the group played “Old Country.” Before this performance, Alpenglow’s main vocalist, Graeme Daubert, shared that the song was written about his grandfather — one of the few times the band spoke out to the audience. The set closed with a single from the album Catskills — a quiet, somber tune that picked up toward the end, characterized by the ghostly effect of the violin.
Even for those who had never heard of Alpenglow before the show, the group’s style was immediately evident from the songs it played: The band members played heavily with the acoustic guitar, and their songs were characterized by their distinctive use of harmonies and instruments. The tunes that incorporated the violin were particularly impressive. The band made frequent use of the keyboard, banjo, and mouth harmonica, which the audience was delighted to hear. Some of their songs had infectious beats, sounding like Coldplay and Arcade Fire rolled into one band.
The band members stayed on after the performance to talk to students and sell copies of their EP, and were very friendly and engaging. In the future, look forward to hearing more from this excellent, upcoming band.

Arcade Fire’s latest opus, double album Reflektor, proves the band only continues to get better. Featuring lush orchestral arrangements and dance-ready rhythms, the album — released last week — meditates on life, death, and the collective and singular experiences of music and art. Just like Talking Heads — an obvious influence on the album — in the 1980s, Arcade Fire is this decade’s most creative, well-known group that continues to outdo everyone else, even itself.
Arcade Fire doesn’t release albums just for the sake of releasing albums; instead, the band spends two to three years crafting a piece of art that is unveiled to the world once finished. Once the biggest band in indie world, Arcade Fire became one of the most well-known names in mainstream music when its 2010 album The Suburbs won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2011.
Produced by the original hipster hater and retired LCD Soundsystem creative force James Murphy, Reflektor features rhythms far better suited to dance than anything we’ve heard from Arcade Fire before. The title track features a solid disco beat, while “Here Comes The Night Time” has everything from dramatic tempo shifts to bouncing Caribbean hand drums and jangling piano.
Arcade Fire has brought new ingredients to its unique sound with every album, and Reflektor adds rich orchestral arrangements to the stew. Second-disc standouts “Awful Sound (Oh Eurydice),” “Porno,” and “Afterlife” are prime examples of the mastery with which Arcade Fire incorporates new sounds into the fabric of the songs.
That being said, one of the album’s highest points comes with the simple rock-and-roll stomp of “Normal Person.” With rougher production and drums that sound like crashing pots and pans, the song is a momentary explosion in an otherwise controlled flow of emotion.
Arcade Fire seems to exclusively tackle “big idea” themes, and after the band’s debut — 2004’s Funeral — Reflektor is the second album in which the band has focused so intensely on life and death. Nine years later, Arcade Fire has gone a little deeper than the child-like musings of Funeral. While that album’s “Rebellion (Lies)” chose to hide from the world rather than face it, Reflektor’s “Afterlife” instead muses on deep questions with lyrics like, “When love is gone, where does it go?” and visions of “what comes next.”
At times, the lyrics — like those in “Joan of Arc” — sound like poetry written by someone in the 10th grade: “They’re the ones that spit on you / Cause they got no heart / I’m the one that will follow you / You’re my Joan of Arc.”
But that’s always been a part of what makes Arcade Fire so engaging. These musicians wear their hearts on their sleeves and say with dignity what many of us are embarrassed to say, with the musical chops to back up every semi-cheesy line.
In a year of high-profile album releases and rollouts that employed wild strategies to build up anticipation — Daft Punk’s Random Access Memories and Kanye West’s Yeezus come to mind — none feel more deserving of the hype than Reflektor. It’s an album that proves that a band at the peak of its creative powers is still willing to try new things rather than settle on formulas. It’s a testament to how, even in an age when Jay-Z’s album goes instantly platinum thanks to a multimillion-dollar business deal with Samsung, passion and commitment are still recognized.

Dear Ryan and Matt (if those are your real names),
Dudes, I can’t help it! I’m stuck in my room watching all the TV shows from my childhood in the ’90s. I’ve made it through all eight seasons of Home Improvement, the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, seven seasons of Buffy, two seasons of Sonic the Hedgehog, and all four Home Alone movies. I’m sure all the girls on my floor think it’s fly that I’m getting back in touch with this culture, but none of them want to watch the TGIF lineups with me. What am I doing wrong, home skillets?
Help would be nice. As if!

Dear NOSTALGIA,
Chill out dawg, We’ve been there. Bill Nye the Science Guy is the reason Ryan got into Carnegie Mellon, and we all yearn for a time before Dubya Bush. The second half of the semester often picks up and will knock those lazy tendencies right out of you. That might also help with your girl problem; women love a man who can demonstrate dependability. There is a time for work and a time for play, and the ’90s were certainly a time for play, but I’m sure you know that Carnegie Mellon is unfortunately a place for work. Buckle up!
Actually, for the ladies, Friends should be next in your Netflix cue.
Matt & Ryan
Dear Matt & Ryan,
I went to a great Halloween party last night, and I met a really great guy. Don’t let him know, but he is definitely my next boyfriend. I went as a classic witch and happened across the perfect scarecrow. I hope next year he can be the yang to my yin; needless to say, we really hit it off. The only problem is I never got his name, or his Andrew ID. Can you guys help me?

Dear ELPHABA,
If you love someone deeply enough, anything can happen, even miracles. You might want to head back to that house and wait for your Halloween love, just like Brigadoon’s Tommy. We have no doubt that Jack Skellington can help you find your love, or maybe if you get the flying monkeys to kidnap the girl dressed as Dorothy, Toto will lead your scarecrow right to you. We’re pretty sure that might be a felony, but if you do it in the name of love, any judge will look the other way.
Scarecrow, if you are reading this, go find your Elphaba. She’s head over heels for you, and we don’t want to be responsible for attempted kidnapping…
Ryan & Matt

Pacific Rim
Saturday, Nov. 9 — 7 p.m.
Sunday, Nov. 10 — 9:30 p.m.
You know what’s awesome? Giant monsters. You know what’s even better? Giant robots fighting giant monsters. Director Guillermo del Toro revives the kaiju genre with his spectacular film that celebrates action as a form of art and pure entertainment. When the world is on the brink of kaiju domination, humanity’s only hope is to recruit the world’s best fighters to pilot warrior robots called jaegers. The film contains some of the best action sequences in recent memory that truly revive and redefine monster movies with its own inventive rush of adrenaline. For two hours, you can sit down and regress to your 10-year-old self as you are reminded of what makes for true entertainment.
The Wolverine
Saturday, Nov. 9 — 10 p.m.
Sunday, Nov. 10 — 7 p.m.
In the sequel to the first solo superhero film of the X-Men franchise, Hugh Jackman returns as the Wolverine to fight samurai-ninjas in Japan. After battling his inner demons, the Wolverine believes he is finally free of his superhero abilities when a Japanese business tycoon offers to get rid of his cursed immortality. What ensues afterward is an adrenaline-fueled series of intense action sequences that is perfectly paced and suspenseful. After a rather lackluster prequel, director James Mangold manages to make this more than a popcorn summer flick by infusing it with authentic character development and a powerfully dark storyline that avoids cheesiness. Jackman (and his insanely ripped body) proves yet again that he can do just about anything, especially with a set of claws made of adamantium.

Peter Masters, junior international relations and politics and philosophy double major, resigned from his position as student body vice president for the fall semester, citing personal reasons.
Masters said that he needs to “take a step back and take care of [himself] a little bit.” He will be taking a leave of absence for the spring semester.
“I wholeheartedly support Masters’s decision to step down and understand that while he was doing great work for the student body, this was absolutely the best decision for him to make,” said Lindsay MacGillivray, senior biology major and student body president. “His resignation does not in any way reflect the work that he did while in the role, and I know that he will still be able to stay engaged with students on campus.”
“Peter Masters did a wonderful job in his position as VP. His creativity paired with his extensive prior experience with student government on campus, made him an excellent candidate for the VP position, and he was working on many different projects that would benefit the student body in a number of ways,” she continued.
As student body vice president, Masters was in the process of spearheading several campus initiatives, including improvements in dining and outdoor study spaces. Masters is working on creating a “Carnegie Mellon survival guide” that gives tips on how to succeed at Carnegie Mellon to first-year students. 
“One of the biggest things I am personally passionate about is dining here,” Masters said in an interview. “A big thing for me was creating an allergen-free location and having more late night options, since a lot of CMU students seem to stay up forever.”
Masters, although he is resigning, will continue supporting these causes. “VP is really just a title, and these are all things that I’m very passionate about and will continue working on,” Masters said.
Following Masters’s resignation, MacGillivray began the search for someone to fulfill his role. According to MacGillivray, she tentatively plans to appoint junior electrical and computer engineering major and student government cabinet member Ian Glasner as Masters’s replacement, pending approval from Student Senate and the Graduate Student Assembly. According to the student government constitution, which can be viewed online at www.cmu.edu/stugov/policies, if “the [student body vice president] position becomes vacant, the president may appoint a member of the student body to fill the position. Either Student Senate or the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) may reject this appointment by way of two-thirds supermajority vote at a regular meeting of student senate or the graduate student assembly, respectively.”
“Since the position is now an appointed position, I used different networks of students to solicit suggestions for new vice president candidates, specifically Senate, GSA, and my cabinet. After receiving different suggestions from students, I interviewed four different excellent candidates for the position and ultimately decided that Ian Glasner would be my appointment,” MacGillivray said.
Glasner is currently a community adviser in the Residence on Fifth, a member of MacGillivray’s student government cabinet, a brother of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and a founder of an organization that will travel to Haiti to support communities there.
“Ian brings a variety of different experiences and skills to the vice president position.... I am excited about the opportunity to work with Ian and am confident in his abilities to quickly matriculate into the position,” MacGillivray said. “Since he has served as part of my cabinet, he understands the initiatives that we are working on currently and has some great new ideas to bring to the table as well.”
In this upcoming week, MacGillivray will present her nomination of Glasner to Student Senate and the GSA.
The approval  will officiate Glasner as the new student body vice president. 
“Once we have gotten this approval, we will make a more formal announcement,” MacGillivray said. 
“Currently, Ian and I have been meeting to adjust our platform to meet our combined ambitions and address the needs of campus. We will also most likely be changing our office hours and finding more unique ways to reach out to the student body.” The announcement of SBVP will be released sometime this week.

Pittsburgh’s 2013 mayoral election between Democrat nominee Bill Peduto and Republican nominee Josh Wander takes place tomorrow.
Current mayor Luke Ravenstahl, announced his decision not to run for re-election last March, and has become less and less prominent in his role as mayor since then.
Ravenstahl’s path toward leaving the office has been speckled with controversy. Two weeks ago, Ravenstahl tweeted messages about his legacy from his home and from a nearby country club during the workday. 
Ravenstahl has been criticized for being aloof and absent ever since he withdrew from the race.
Ravenstahl is also known to have unfriendly political ties with Peduto; according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, during the primary race Ravenstahl allegedly used campaign money after he drew out of the race to air advertisements critical of Peduto. 
Background 
Wander grew up in Pittsburgh, but has dual citizenship in the U.S. and Israel, where he is currently residing and working, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. Wander received his master’s degree from the University of Pittsburgh in public and international affairs. He is a relative newcomer to the political scene, having previously served as constable of White Oak, Pennsylvania following several unsuccessful runs for local offices including Pittsburgh mayor and Pittsburgh City Council.
Peduto has a long history as a Pittsburgh politician. having served on the Pittsburgh City Council for the past 11 years. He recently made a visit to Carnegie Mellon to give a lecture as part of the Forum on Economic Development. Peduto has a long history of initiating reform within Pittsburgh. According to his website, Peduto — a self-described “reform Democrat” — wrote “the most comprehensive package of government reform legislation in Pittsburgh’s history.” He has also focused on redeveloping Pittsburgh’s East End.
Campaign
According to Wander’s campaign website, Pittsburgh security is an issue that he wants to tackle by establishing strong ties between each community and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. He also wants to address the flaws of the mayoral position, such as a lack of presence both in the office and on the streets of Pittsburgh; he hopes to “provide the leadership needed to consolidate, privatize, and establish cooperative services with the county to save money for the taxpayers of Pittsburgh.”
Peduto, according to his website, served as co-creator and co-chair of Pittsburgh’s Comprehensive Climate Action Plan. As co-chair, Peduto helped write legislation to protect Pittsburgh’s “unique green hillsides.” He is working to transform Pittsburgh into a “Med/Ed New Economy.” Peduto, as a reform Democrat, is working to transform Pittsburgh’s economy and bring it out of its recent recession to meet national needs and standards.
Student Response
Many students, when interviewed, were unfamiliar with Wander and his policies. Philip Farr, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major, said that he had never heard of the candidate. “I don’t know much about Wander; all of the news I’ve seen seems to focus on Peduto and his platform.” 
Bineh Ndefru, a junior materials science and engineering major, supports Peduto. “I’m not registered to vote here, but if I were, I would vote for him. I like him a lot.”
Max Goetschel, a sophomore public policy and management, economics, and math triple major, attended Peduto’s lecture at Carnegie Mellon and also supports his proposed policies. “[At the lecture] he answered simple questions about transportation with concrete examples, and gave complicated questions about race a pragmatic and sensible response,” Goetschel said.

The College Board recently released its annual Trends in College Pricing report, which shows the increase in tuition, fees, and room and board at U.S. institutions of higher education. The report examines how the prices of both public and private institutions in the U.S. have fluctuated in recent years.
The Trends in College Pricing report measures college tuition by several different metrics, including published price — the price a college or university gives — and net price, which, according to the College Board, is the “published price minus the grant aid that students receive.”
The College Board notes in the online version of the Trends in College Pricing report that “net prices are frequently much lower than published prices and represent the amount students actually pay.”
According to the report, the average cost of out-of-state and in-state tuition, fees, room, and board for public, four-year colleges went up 3.2 percent within the past year. For private, nonprofit, four-year institutions — which include Carnegie Mellon  — prices rose 3.7 percent.
While the national average net price for private, nonprofit, four-year colleges increased in line with total sticker price, financial aid — as measured by both federal and private loans and grants — has decreased in the past year.
According to the College Board’s 2013 Trends in Student Aid report, released in conjunction with the Trends in College Pricing report, total national average aid in the 2011–12 academic year was $15,696; in 2012–13 it decreased $163 to $15,533. These figures include national averages for several forms of aid, ranging from private student loans to subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans and education tax benefits.
This year’s percent increase in college tuition is the lowest it has been since the mid 1970s. College tuition and fees, however, are still rising faster than U.S. inflation. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a tool used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to measure inflation; according to the Bureau’s website, the CPI program “produces monthly data on changes in the prices paid by urban consumers for a representative basket of goods and services.”
The CPI increased from 230.79 in May 2012 to 232.945 in August 2013, an increase of about 1 percent. This is significantly lower than the increase in college price reported by the College Board.
At the beginning of every spring semester, Carnegie Mellon announces the tuition and fees for the upcoming academic year. 
In February, a campus-wide email sent out by Vice President for Campus Affairs Michael Murphy announced that there would be a 4 percent increase in new undergraduate tuition rates and a 3 percent increase for current students for the 2013–14 year.
Over the past 10 years, the university has consistently increased tuition by between $1,000 and $3,000 each year. For an incoming, full-time, resident student in 2006, tuition was $41,608. Full-time resident students entering in 2013 had a tuition of $46,670. This figure does not include room and board and other fees.
This figure is in line with many of Carnegie Mellon’s peer institutions. Washington University in St. Louis, for example, charges $42,500 for tuition alone. According to an article in Wash. U.’s  Newsroom, this is a 3.8 percent increase from the previous year.
At New York University, tuition for an undergraduate student entering the College of Arts and Sciences in 2013 was $42,472. 
At the University of Rochester, according to their website, tuition increased 3.9 percent from $42,890 to $44,580 for the current academic year.
Regarding financial aid, the university reports that it gave out 5,393 scholarships for the 2012–13 year, with an average award sum of $17,911.20 per person.

Former Secretary of State Colin Powell spoke at the Carnegie Music Hall last Tuesday at an event hosted by the American Middle East Institute. 
The talk was titled “Diplomacy: Persuasion, Trust and Values,” and Powell devoted his time to addressing his four Es: the economy, energy, the environment, and education.
Powell was born to Jamaican immigrants in Harlem  and went on to become a four-star general in the military. In 1987, Powell was selected to serve as President Ronald Reagan’s national security adviser, and then served as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff for Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton before being appointed as secretary of state for President George W. Bush.
The event drew a considerable audience, nearly filling the venue. Simin Curtis, the president and CEO of the American Middle East Institute, opened the event. 
Powell’s speech was the conclusion to a day-long business conference on energy and water hosted by the Institute. Numerous Middle Eastern dignitaries attended the event, including former Egyptian ministers, Libyan Deputy Minister of Oil and Gas Abdulbari Arousi, as well as what Curtis described as “the crème de la crème of American CEOs [of] water and renewable energy [companies].”
Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett introduced Powell and remarked that “The tradition of the soldier-statesman dates back to George Washington,” referencing Powell’s military service, and after reading quotes from Powell’s writings and interviews, added, “Powell is an emblem of what America does well.”
Powell then took the stage, complimenting the American Middle East Institute, saying, “They understand the importance of understanding cultures of different people in different parts of the world.”
He spoke of the value of economic activity in Middle Eastern development, remarking, “When you think about what happens in the Middle East, it’s not just about wars and conflicts.” Powell recalled anecdotes 
from his diplomatic experience, highlighting the desire for jobs and work in that area of the world.
Powell praised the value of “the creation of wealth, not that just goes to the top of the pile, but that brings us up from poverty,” recalling when he toured China shortly after the Cultural Revolution. “I could see that these people wanted a better life,” he said.
“What does it take to industrialize? Energy.” Powell added that in the near future, “energy will be so in demand that anything that can be produced will find a market.”
Powell spoke favorably of natural gas extraction from Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale deposits, claiming that shale gas put the state “in a unique position to supply energy.” He added, “but we must do this in a way not to destroy the environment.”
Powell spoke of how Pennsylvania’s economy used to rely on petrochemicals and manufacturing, but has improved its environmental conditions. “It’s now education and medicine here in Pittsburgh more than manufacturing.”
Drawing on his modest background when speaking about education, Powell said, “It isn’t where you start in life, it’s where you end up.”
Powell admitted that he did not have the best high school grades, but “I went to school and college without it costing my parents a dime.” 
He praised the decision of New York tax payers to choose to fund the education of low-income students, adding “I think every community in America should make that kind of commitment to education in America.”
He continued, “We need to educate our youngsters for a different kind of economy: a more sophisticated one, where education matters now more than it ever did before.”
Powell also went on to share some personal stories throughout his time on stage. “I have to be candid with you,” he began, “at this point in my life and career I’m just glad to be anywhere.”
He described that leaving his position as secretary of state was a difficult transition. “I’ve been out of government for a few years, but I still think about it,” and jokingly offered the advice, “If anyone else in this room has any kind of difficulty in their 70s, buy a Corvette.”
In addition to a new car and several major lifestyle changes, Powell said, “I’m probably as busy now as I ever was. It’s just a different kind of busy,” describing his speaking tours and work in venture capital.
His speech then turned to current events, with Powell emphatically warning, “I don’t want to get into an argument about Obamacare. I don’t know enough about it. I have socialized medicine from the military and I’m happy with it. But we need to make sure everyone has access,” continuing on to say it was unacceptable that a country as wealthy as the United States had people without some kind of access to health care.
Powell then addressed Congressional gridlock and political polarization. “What I say to my friends in Congress is you guys are in big trouble now,” he said. 
He stressed the importance of compromise, referencing the extreme compromises in the Constitutional Convention, “They even had to compromise on the awful, horrible issue of slavery.”
“If they could sit there for just a few weeks and come out with our Constitution, tell me why Congress can’t sit there and compromise on a budget.”
He continued to be critical of government spending, and Congressmen “not realizing the books have to balance.”
Powell revealed that he now only watches foreign news sources, and criticized the polarization caused by networks such as FOX and MSNBC. He concluded his remarks on Congress by saying, “When I was young I saw leaders in Congress then. There aren’t any now.”
Powell told some illustrative stories about leadership and organizational management, and also addressed the current state of American security. “We are no longer in the kind of danger we were before 9/11, but we need to maintain our safety without showing the rest of the world that we’re scared,” adding, “We can’t let that happen or the terrorists win.”
Questions submitted prior to the event asked Powell of his opinions on the National Security Agency (NSA) spying scandal and Iraq, amongs other topics.
On the NSA, Powell said, “We have a great capability in the NSA and other security organizations. Sometimes we need to listen in on our allies. But this will come back our way,” adding, “You’d have to make quite a case to me, if I were still in government, on why we need to listen in on Angela Merkel’s cell phone.”
Addressing whether Iraq is better off than in 2003, Powell responded, “Yes, it no longer has Saddam Hussein terrorizing its people.”
Powell concluded his talk with some general remarks about America’s place in the world. “We’re still number one, but in a different kind of way. We have to be understanding.” With respect to conflicts such as those in Syria and Egypt, Powell advised, “America should not believe we have a magic solution for these problems.” He added that “we not interfere until other countries are ready to receive it.”
Powell referenced his parents’ immigration to America, and told stories about his encounters with immigrant workers in America. “As long as we remain an open country… we will continue to lead this world that wants to be free.”

Special reading hosted by writing department to welcome new members
The creative writing department will welcome Kevin Gonzalez and Lauren Shapiro to Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh with a special reading on Nov. 12 at 4:30 p.m.
Gonzalez is a Carnegie Mellon alumnus who received bachelor’s degrees in creative writing and international relations.  Shapiro has degrees from Brown University and Iowa Writers’ Workshop. The two will join a decorated group of poets and writers in the English department.
Currently at Carnegie Mellon, Gonzalez teaches Beginning Fiction Workshop and Beginning Poetry Workshop. Gonzalez  has written a poetry collection, Cultural Studies, and  is currently writing a novel. Gonzalez’s novel has had excerpts published in Playboy, Narrative magazine, Best New American Voices, and Best American Nonrequired Reading.
Shapiro, experienced in book editing, publishing, and literary translation, wrote a book, Easy Math, which won the Kathryn A. Morton Prize.
According to a press release, Gonzalez said, “I feel extremely fortunate to have been able to return to CMU’s Creative Writing Program as a faculty member. My experience as an undergrad here undoubtedly shaped me in many ways, as a writer, an editor, and even as a teacher. Although writing itself is a solitary act, I find that I, and most writers that I know, work best when part of a thriving literary community. The program at CMU is unparalleled, as far as undergraduate creative writing programs go, in building a strong sense of community between students and faculty.”
Lower wealth leads to higher risk of colds according to CMU researchers
Lower socioeconomic status in childhood and adolescence makes aging individuals more prone to disease, according to the findings of Carnegie Mellon researchers. 
The study, published in Brain, Behavior and Immunity, shows that children and adolescents go on to have shorter telomeres, biomarkers of age in a cell’s DNA that naturally get shorter with age. Shorter telomeres eventually cease to function, causing the cell to die. Shorter telomeres are also connected to cardiovascular disease and cancer, among other diseases and health problems.
Sheldon Cohen, the Robert E. Doherty Professor of Psychology at Carnegie Mellon, and his team took 152 healthy volunteers between ages 18–55 and measured their white blood cell telomere lengths. 
To judge socioeconomic status, the researchers had participants report whether they owned a home and whether their parents owned the family home during their childhood. Participants were exposed to a rhinovirus, which often starts a cold, and were quarantined five days to determine whether they had an upper respiratory infection. Less wealthy participants had shorter telomere lengths compared to their peers. For every year a participant’s parent did not own a home, their telomeres were on average 5 percent shorter than their peers’.
According to a press release, Cohen said, “We have found initial evidence for a biological explanation of the importance of childhood experiences on adult health. The association we found in young and midlife adults suggests why those raised by parents of relatively low socioeconomic status may be at increased risk for disease throughout adulthood.”

Committee Update: Business Affairs
Senate will be hosting a senior lecture series, for which students nominate seniors they consider successful to give a speech. The nomination form should be on the Carnegie Mellon Undergraduate Student Senate Facebook page soon. The lectures will be held on Feb. 20, 2014; March 20, 2014; and April 17, 2014. 
Points of Discussion
Senators have not been very interested in events hosted by the Internal Development Committee this semester, so Senate discussed methods for getting memberes to attend such events. Senate agreed that the events themselves don’t matter as much as actually getting S enators to attend. One suggestion was a Senate Christmas party. 
The Academic Affairs Committee is looking to create a set of guidelines outlining a level of decorum and common courtesy for students. These would not be strictly enforced rules, but a set of community standards.  Academic Affairs is looking for ideas about what to include in these guidelines.
Committee Update: Campus Life
The campus life committee tabled on Wednesday and Friday in front of Doherty Hall and successfully distributed 500 cookies and 32 gallons of cider for free to the student body. Tazza D’Oro, who sponsored the event by providing the cider, was pleased with the outcome.
Committee Update: Academic Affairs
Thrive@CMU, a mini designed to address recent issues raised about Carnegie Mellon’s stress culture, is in progress. Teaching assistant evaluations are mostly being handled by the Graduate Student Assembly this semester. A speaker may come to an upcoming Senate meeting to talk about mid-semester evaluations. Recently, Academic Affairs Committee members have listened in on Student Advisory Council meetings for various majors. Academic Affairs is considering using part of its budget to purchase new printers.

Because of the controversy surrounding the National Security Agency (NSA), it came as no surprise when Edward Snowden leaked documents revealing that the United States has been spying on 35 world leaders, many of which are close American allies.
Last week, the German tabloid Bild am Sonntag revealed that President Barack Obama had been informed that the NSA was spying on German chancellor Angela Merkel and allowed it to continue. However, due to the nature and nearly unlimited power of this organization, I find it unlikely that Obama was told.
Critics of Obama like to believe that he was all knowing on the matter, but he most likely had no idea that this surveillance was occurring, as government secrecy and division have been going on for years.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and other federal organizations have failed to share information and work together in the past. In fact, Attorney General John Ashcroft identified this failure to share information as the reason that the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001 were carried out so easily. Khalid Muhammad Abdallah al-Mihdhar, one of the Sept. 11 hijackers, was placed on the CIA watchlist in August 2001, but the FBI could not work on his case. Ashcroft quoted an FBI agent who complained in an email about the FBI’s inability to take action, “Whatever has happened to this, someday somebody will die.”
However, Obama isn’t necessarily innocent in the matter of the NSA spying. He voted as a Senator in 2008 to support the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 2008 to expand the organization’s wiretapping abilities. Congress and Obama might not have known the extent at which the NSA was spying on citizens, but they put more power in its hands. They essentially gave the NSA the power to curtail the Constitution and nearly infinite ability to conduct surveillance.
This problem is occurring in many of our federal security agencies. Due to the threat of terrorism, the U.S. has continued to place more power into the hands of organizations like the NSA, while not requiring them to report what they are doing or follow traditional Constitutional procedures. In the process of tracking U.S. enemies through NSA surveillance, the government creates more enemies by spying on countries that had no prior issue with the U.S.
President George W. Bush and Obama have continued to pass national security bills in hopes of protecting citizens from terrorist attacks. 
However, with every bill, there is a major tradeoff — liberty. Americans are now giving away their hard-earned rights for the false notion that they are somehow safer.
By giving unwarranted powers to the NSA and other organizations, the U.S. is creating more enemies than it is defeating. 
In fact, the NSA has done very little in the way of preventing terrorist attacks. The NSA Chief Army General Keith Alexander even admitted at an oversight hearing in early October that only one or two terrorist plots have been foiled through the wiretapping program, according to cso.com.
The NSA has enraged many nations that are considered American allies, and some are now planning to remove U.S. influence over the Internet. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff is already making plans to move Internet servers of major services to Brazil and construct underwater fiber optic cables that curtail the U.S. and run directly to Europe, according to the Associated Press.
As the U.S. spies on foreign leaders, many of them are going to take efforts like Brazil to remove U.S. power from the Internet and, in turn, reduce the U.S. government’s ability to conduct surveillance. In order to ensure the liberties and protection of citizens while surveillance occurs, the NSA must only track information on people who are direct threats and remain transparent enough that the President knows when a major world leader is being tracked.

It has been a riveting week with a devastating end for Texan pro-choice advocates against one of the most restrictive anti-abortion bills currently in America, HB 12. The bill, which is set to close at least one-third of Texas’s abortion clinics immediately, has had an intensely controversial history over the past several months.
In June, state Sen. Wendy Davis (D-Texas) successfully filibustered the bill and the fraudulent suppression tactics of the Republican state legislature, but Governor Rick Perry (R-Texas) — a notorious reproductive rights opponent — called a special session of the state Senate to push the bill through. 
This Monday, District Judge Lee Yeakel struck down the most destructive provision of the law, which requires Texas abortion clinics to obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, supposedly to better assure the safety of abortion procedures. In a victory for Planned Parenthood, Yeakel ruled that such a provision has no rational basis or medical purpose, and that the provision was unconstitutional because it placed an unnecessary restriction on women seeking an abortion.
However, the court decision was overturned on Thursday by the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. The court countered that the provision requiring admitting privileges was constitutionally valid and that “the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion cannot be enough to invalidate” a bill that otherwise serves a legitimate purpose.
The hollowness in the appeals court’s excuse to validate an arguably unconstitutional and surely unjust bill should be self-evident. The legitimate purpose this bill supposedly serves is hazy, and Perry, speaking during Thursday’s ruling, seems confident that its true purpose is to “protect a culture of life” in Texas.
Additionally, the claim that the law protects Texas women’s health and safety is ignorant to the point of ridiculousness. Republican politicians dictating the private reproductive decisions of women continually fail to realize that cutting off access to abortion clinics will not decrease demand for abortions. Instead of stopping abortions from occurring, anti-abortion laws force women to improvise, travel further, and pay extra for procedures that are ultimately more risky than any performed in a licensed clinic.
No less important, many clinics targeted by the Texas bill and similar anti-abortion laws provide abortion with many other services vital to women’s health. Planned Parenthood, for example, offers birth control, sexually transmitted infection and HIV testing, pap smears, and breast cancer screenings. When the Texas bill goes into effect, women will not only lose simple and safe access to abortions, but also access to a wide range of other crucial services that may not be available through primary doctors or local hospitals. This bill hardly sounds like one designed with the best interests of Texan women in mind.
More likely, this bill is a predictable attempt by conservative Republicans to hoard control over the reproductive and sexual rights of women. 
By staying angry and continuing to fight these misogynistic laws wherever they inevitably arise nationwide, we can prove that the ability of a woman to do with her body as she so chooses can’t be legislated.

Russian President Vladimir Putin stated last Tuesday that LGBT athletes would be welcome to compete at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics. This announcement came after Putin passed a law in Russia that prohibits people from distributing information to minors that acknowledges same-sex relationships. Foreigners are held accountable under this law and are subject to fines, detainment, or deportation. Many U.S. citizens called to boycott the Olympics after the law passed. While Putin made a quick turnaround by stating that LGBT foreigners and athletes would not be made to feel uneasy, many people are still calling for boycotts.
The reasons behind boycotting are admirable and agreeable, but boycotts are ultimately not useful and flawed in logic. The Olympic Games, or any international sporting events, are based around cooperation and diversity. To boycott — even if it is because the host country does not champion these two ideals — would be to take away the cooperation and diversity promoted during the games. However, it is still crucial to question why Russia has the stage for one of the world’s most important sporting events. The Olympic spirit is about equality. Diversity — whether it is based on race, sexuality, or gender — should not be frowned upon, but embraced.
Picking a country like Russia makes no sense in light of the Olympic spirit. One of Russia’s most celebrated athletes, twice gold-medal pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva, said in August about Putin’s anti-gay law: “If we allow to promote and do all this stuff on the street, we are very afraid about our nation because we consider ourselves like normal, standard people.” She later retracted her comments, saying that her poor English was responsible for the statement, according to The Guardian. 
Moreover, FIFA has given Russia the chance to host the World Cup. Just a week ago, during a match against an English soccer team, CSKA Moscow, a Russian soccer club, was penalized by the Union of European Football Associations — the European soccer governing-body — because fans hurtled racial slurs at a black player on the field, according to The New York Times. Russia has a patchy equal rights record when it comes to race and sexuality, yet boycotting the games in Russia would do nothing to promote equality or diversity in the face of this rocky record.
Russia’s citizens are actually very liberal — more liberal than the average American gives them credit for. They support abortion based on the woman’s choice and, according to The New Republic, premarital sex and single parenthood are common, very much like Western European secular cultures, even though most of the population still identifies as Russian Orthodox. Its unique religious identity is where Russia differs from the rest of Europe and where the stigma against gays originates from. Seventy-four percent of Russians believe that homosexuality is some sort of abnormality. This is another crucial reason why boycotting won’t work. It’s not the Russian government that is against homosexuality, but Russian popular opinion, as Isinbayeva demonstrated.
A boycott is an act of defiance against the government making a bad decision. The Russian people’s unique geography, culture, and history has led to an interesting mix of European and Asian beliefs, as well as individual ones. A boycott would almost be hypocritical. Gay athletes are barely given a chance to succeed — as evidenced by the very few professional athletes who have come out — in the United States and Western Europe. A boycott will not persuade the people of Russia to strive for equality, as they will only see Americans as the enemy, and unworthy of competition.
A boycott will also harm American athletes who have prepared their entire lives to ski, shoot, and jump on the largest stage possible. They have prepared for their moment of glory. To boycott would be to take away that potential glory. Boycotting will show Russians nothing, only that Americans seem unable to compete. By competing in Russia, Americans will show Russian citizens that diversity — in any form — is celebrated.

November is National Novel Writing Month, more commonly known as NaNoWriMo. Writers sign up during October to participate in the entirely friendly competition, which lasts from Nov. 1–20. Participants write as much as they can every day for the entire month, and if the novel ends up being over 50,000 words, they can enter to win prizes within the NaNoWriMo community.
NaNoWriMo has benefits for both people who love to write and people who feel they have no writing skills whatsoever, although the benefits for writers are a little more obvious than those for the latter group. 
NaNoWriMo offers writers of all ages from around the world the opportunity to connect with other writers and published authors, trade ideas, and support each other. It creates a community-based culture around a hobby that can be isolating and lonely.
Even beyond offering support and inspiration, NaNoWriMo can be really fun, even if you don’t participate in the traditional way. Personally, I plan to use NaNoWriMo as a way to remind myself to write every day, but not to race at a breakneck speed to a specific character count. The competition is a fun method for expressing creative energies in a personal way.
The benefits for non-writers are a little more opaque, and lie not so much in the writing itself, but more in the development of the creative process. No experience is required to sign up for NaNoWriMo. Of course, the prospect of throwing oneself into writing with such force can be intimidating for people who have not written much in the past, but NaNoWriMo encourages participants to embrace their mistakes, whether those participants have been writing for 20 years or two days. 
Writers doing the traditional challenge have to produce around 1,666 words every day, which is around five-and-a-half pages, to get to 50,000 words in a month’s time. 
That kind of cramming does not produce America’s next great novel, and the people who run NaNoWriMo know that. Producing sub-par work is acceptable in this competition, because everyone does it, and that’s how they learn. People who never considered themselves writers can participate just as effectively as anyone else.
Even though NaNoWriMo has its charms, some people simply don’t like to write, but that doesn’t mean that they shouldn’t expend their creative energies. Creativity has the potential to reduce stress, bolster self-confidence, and stimulate brain health, although the cultural definition of creativity tends toward clearly artistic activities like writing, drawing, or photography. People also tend to think that creativity is something that some people have, and others just don’t. Being creative is not a personality trait; it is another word for human expression. Coming up with a scientific experiment and testing it can require the same creative energies as painting a picture.
So whether you’re writing a novel or a computer program, try to stretch your creative muscles this November.

Two weeks ago, Carnegie Mellon’s Student Senate hosted its third annual Student Senate week. Free cupcakes, drawstring bags, water bottles, and sunglasses were all part of the festivities and were appreciated by the student body. However, Student Senate could have more effectively directed attention to their causes. The free gifts were enjoyed, but there was a lack of connection between the Student Senate’s presence on campus this week and its issues and causes.
This year’s Student Senate week came in the wake of a particularly successful week last year, when the event was highly advertised and the student body engaged with its Senate representatives. Last year’s week was focused on what Student Senate could do for the students that it represents. College representatives sent emails to the students within their colleges, introducing themselves and inviting students to provide input on Student Senate initiatives. The emails showed the Student Senate’s strong attempts to connect with students. This year, no such emails were sent out, and such efforts haven’t been easily visible.
The Tartan appreciates the giveaways that Student Senate provided this year — what college student doesn’t like cookies and cider? — but the outreach provided last year was sorely missed this year. While Student Senate representatives talked to students at the tables, they did not seem to promote their initiatives as well as last year’s Senators.
Though free giveaways are a great way to increase visibility of any organization on campus, they can also be coordinated with the goals and interests of that organization more effectively. Student Senate promotes a wide variety of talks that are both interesting and relevant to campus life. The Tartan would have liked to see Student Senate consistently promote its relevant talks during these giveaways, particularly their weekly Student Senate meetings, which are open to the student body.
If Student Senate wants to increase its visibility and presence on campus, it needs to pair the attention-grabbing giveaways with promotions of their other campus initiatives. Hopefully, Student Senate week will use and build upon 2012’s Student Senate week as a model for planning future Student Senate weeks.

In a report released this week, the NFL concluded that high school students are twice as likely to suffer brain injuries as college students when playing football. Concussions are often treated as frequent occurrences, expected side effects of playing sports or engaging in physical activity. However, most students fail to realize that concussions are serious medical conditions that are treated far too lightly and can have significant impacts on one’s academic performance, not only in high school, but also in college.
According to Mayo Clinic, a concussion is a traumatic brain injury that can cause headaches, loss of concentration, and difficulties with memory, judgment, and coordination. Concussions occur when the brain shifts within the skull. As documented by Medical News Today, effects from concussions can last up to decades after the incident if the injury is severe enough.
This information is cause for concern, as many concussions happen to high school students whose brains are still developing. Silive.com  reported that approximately 502,000 people between the ages of 8 and 19 were admitted to emergency rooms with concussions between 2001 and 2005, and half of these were attributed to sports. More shockingly, the American College of Sports Medicine documents 300,000 sports- and recreation-related concussions in the U.S. each year, but estimates that this number may be seven times greater in reality, as many concussions are never reported.
The brain trauma associated with concussions can have serious implications, especially for those with developing brains. Many people who have concussions say that their cognitive performance suffers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention documented a case in which a student reported that it “actually hurt to think” after a concussion. These injuries have negative impacts on learning and school performance, which can have a long-term impact on student’s success and well-being. Effects of concussions can last weeks after symptoms disappear, and mental exertion can worsen these effects, according to The Wall Street Journal. For high school and college students who suffer concussions, the injury can mean less-than-optimal academic performance in the weeks following the injury.
People need to be more aware of the effects of concussions and consider taking further steps to protect athletes from injuries that can negatively impact their academic futures. Generally, students who suffer concussions should not mentally exert themselves too much in the weeks following their injury. They must consider that the effects may last long after the initial injury and should not attempt to resume their normal strenuous academic schedules until they have given the brain ample time to recover.

Electronic cigarettes entered the market almost 10 years ago, and between 2008 and 2012, sales increased from 50,000 to 3.5 million, according to USA Today.
Now, the multiflavored vapor is finally catching regulators’ attentions: Doctors of the Pennsylvania Medical Society believe that e-cigarettes should have the same regulations as tobacco products, despite e-cigarettes being advertised as safe and socially conscious alternatives to cigarettes.
People should know more about e-cigarettes before they decide how they should be regulated, but unfortunately, they’re already a fixture in the market. Pennsylvania physicians are right, at least for now: While analysts gather statistics on the effects of e-cigarettes and their secondhand vapors, e-cigarettes that contain nicotine should be regulated just like their tobacco-flavored counterparts. E-cigarettes seem like an easy fix to the problem of secondhand smoke, but they should be treated with caution.
With e-cigarettes, there is no secondhand smoke, but more importantly, they don not use any tobacco. As such, the risk for developing cancer is drastically lower. However, a recent study from France’s National Consumer Institute suggested that e-cigarettes are potentially carcinogenic. This study reveals an immediate need for more studies on the effects of e-cigarettes. Little research has been conducted on e-cigarettes, and no one seems to know much about what happens when a person breathes the vapor for even a short period of time.
The FDA currently treats e-cigarettes as if they have tobacco, which makes sense — nicotine is just as addictive without the tobacco. However, federal law doesn’t bar sale to minors, although certain states prohibit selling e-cigarettes to minors. Currently, Pennsylvania is not one of them  — but it should be.
The purpose of e-cigarettes is to deliver nicotine to the body. Unfortunately, they are still largely unregulated, and this lack of regulation could pose a big problem as their popularity increases. We need to know more about their effects soon so that proper regulations can be put in place.

It's time to get things off your chest. But hurry, because soon you may not be able to.
You must accept your fate instead of trying to fight it.
Everyone has flaws, but the greatest flaw is being unable to recognize your flaws.
Most people have a carefully constructed façade; it's your job to find the cracks.
You will get an opportunity to let someone else know how much they mean to you.
Remember your past experiences and learn from them.
Before you can follow your heart, you have to know where it's going.
Don't let the grass grow under your feet — keep rolling.
Your dreams may make sense if taken literally, but think about their deeper meanings.
Luck and love never run out.
Think about whether not knowing something is worth losing a friend.
If you keep digging, you'll eventually get where you want to go.
