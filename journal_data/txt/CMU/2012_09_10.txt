Tartan defender of the men’s soccer team Ben Bryant is not only impressive on the field, but also in the classroom.
Last year, Bryant played in all 16 soccer games and started in 13 of them. He is a chemistry and Spanish double major, with minors in biomedical engineering and business administration. He plans on staying at Carnegie Mellon for a fifth year and playing one more season on the soccer team because he had a medical redshirt when he was a first-year. Upon matriculation, Bryant plans on attending medical school.
He has been playing soccer since the age of five, for a total of 16 years. 
“The camaraderie our team has on the field is the best part of being on the soccer team,” Bryant said. “My funniest moment on the team came last season when Chris Wysocki, a current junior, scored a must-needed goal, and after he pulled his jersey up to show a t-shirt underneath with the question written, ‘Why Always Me?’ ” Bryant said.
The new season, with some key wins early, looks hopeful for Bryant. “My proudest moment thus far was when we beat Hobart and Stevens; Stevens was ranked seventh in the country this past weekend, kickstarting our season with a 2–0 record,” he said. 
“Ben is a great teammate and leader,” junior midfielder Matt Sarett said. “He sets a good example for the younger players with his work ethic and attitude.” 
With such a strong start, the future for the team looks bright. “For this season, my goals for myself and the team are to win the UAA Conference and get a bid to the NCAA tournament to then compete for the national championship,” Bryant said.
Overall, Bryant has had a great experience so far. “What is most rewarding, but also most challenging, about being a Carnegie Mellon University athlete is juggling the rigorous academics of Carnegie Mellon on top of a very busy athletic schedule,” he said.

I am insurmountably thankful for Major League Baseball’s new Wild Card one-game playoff; this National League Wild Card race would not be a story without it. The Atlanta Braves are sitting pretty — three-and-a-half games up on the field — and without any of the other teams making a strong push, that lead should feel comfortable.
But the sought-after second spot in the Wild Card race gives a team the chance to play the Braves in a one-game playoff — a rule instituted by Major League Baseball before the start of the season. That spot is separated by just one-and-a-half games, with the St. Louis Cardinals above the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Pittsburgh Pirates.
A long-awaited playoff berth for the city of Pittsburgh might signal the apocalypse: The last time the Pirates made the playoffs, or even finished a regular season with a record above .500, was in 1992. This season, behind the bat of MVP candidate and outfielder Andrew McCutchen and with some surprisingly solid pitching led by ace A.J. Burnett, the Pirates have put themselves in a spot to break their horrid streak.
But outside of McCutchen, the offense has been shallow all season. Third baseman Pedro Alvarez exhibited strokes of power with 27 home runs, but does not consistently get on base. His “success” this season has been a treat to fans, but under the gaze of unbiased eyes, his numbers are still average at best. 
Outfielder Garrett Jones, newly acquired first baseman Gaby Sanchez, and second baseman Neil Walker have been solid at the plate this season, posting .280-plus batting averages. But a look at how this team has performed offensively shows a below-average offense: 23rd in runs scored and 21st in batting average.
It has been the Pirates’ pitching that has carried them into the playoff race this season. The team is ninth in the majors in earned run average (ERA), 11th in wins plus hits times innings pitched (WHIP), and seventh in batting average allowed (BAA). I’ve already mentioned Burnett, but the Pirates have also seen great play from starting pitcher James MacDonald and closing pitcher Joel Hanrahan. If the Pirates have a lead in the ninth, Hanrahan has been a model of consistency closing out games and securing victories.
The Dodgers, however, are an enigma as far as I’m concerned. The Dodgers’ new ownership, headed by Earvin “Magic” Johnson, has made drastic strides to stack the offense, adding the likes of infielder Hanley Ramirez, outfielder Shane Victorino, and first baseman Adrian Gonzalez to a lineup already headed by all-star 
outfielders Matt Kemp and Andre Ethier. These moves have shown the depth of the owners’ pockets and their willingness to spend to make the team better.
Despite the talent the Dodgers brought in to beef up their offense, the bats have been average. The Dodgers are posting the 18th-best batting average and 18th-best slugging percentage, and have scored the 24th-most runs in the Major Leagues. Like the Pirates, the Dodgers’ pitching has been surprisingly good.
On paper, the Dodgers’ pitching staff is not anything to fear. Other than 2011 Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw, the starting pitching staff does not seem deep. Behind Kershaw, the Dodgers boast Chris Capuano, Aaron Harang, Joe Blanton, and Josh Beckett. There was a time when Beckett, Capuano, and Harang were elite pitchers in the league, but Capuano and Harang are past their prime and Beckett has been a head case.
Dodgers starting pitchers Chad Billingsley and Ted Lilly also went down with season-ending injuries.
Despite this, the Dodgers’ pitching is fifth in ERA, second in quality starts, and third in BAA. When healthy, closer Kenley Jensen has exhibited how dominant his pitches are, boasting a 2.54 ERA and converting on 25 of 31 save opportunities.
But as I see it, the Cardinals will finish in that second spot to play the Braves in the one-game wild card playoff. The reigning World Series champions have a deeper pitching staff and offense than anyone else in the race.
Their offense is among the best in baseball, led by outfielders Matt Holiday and Carlos Beltran and catcher Yadier Molina. These guys have led the Cardinals to second in runs scored, third in batting average, and second in on-base percentage.
The Cards’ pitching staff has been solid as well, headed by Kyle Lohse and Adam Wainwright, posting the 10th-best ERA and the sixth-most quality starts in the MLB. 
This race is a tight one and should be exciting to the very end of the regular season, but I don’t see the Cardinals, with their World Series experience, giving up the lead in this race.

Pennsylvania college football was shaken up during the past year as both the University of Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania State University went through major changes.
Pitt announced that it was leaving the Big East Conference to go with Syracuse University to the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) starting next season, following in the footsteps of former Big East-turned-ACC schools Virginia Tech University, Miami University, and Boston College.
Pitt also has a new head coach, Paul Chryst, as Todd Graham left after only one season to become the head coach at Arizona State University. 
Penn State has been dealing with the fallout from the Jerry Sandusky scandal, with longtime coach and face of the team Joe Paterno being dismissed and soon thereafter passing away from lung cancer.
New head coach Bill O’Brien has had to deal with harsh sanctions and player transfers as he tries to restore the Nittany Lions to their former glory. Unfortunately, both first-time head coaches have had poor starts to their tenures, as Pitt and Penn State have started the year 0–2.
Pitt football has been a shell of its former glory in recent years, going 7–5 and 6–6 the past two seasons. Even in the Big East, Pitt has had a hard time living up to expectations, and this year seems to be no different. The Panthers started off the year by getting upset 31–17 by the football championship school (formerly Division 1-AA), Youngstown State University.
Pitt’s schedule did not get any easier as they faced Cincinnati last Thursday in their annual Ohio River rivalry game. The Panthers wasted no time falling behind, giving up a 58-yard touchdown run on the first play of the game.
After their rough start, things only got worse, and Cincinnati eventually won 34–10. Pitt continued its struggles on both sides of the ball, as quarterback Tino Sunseri was sacked six times, threw one touchdown, and had one fumble while the defense gave up 464 yards and 19 first downs.
Meanwhile, Penn State’s season is one of change and turnover.
Along with a new head coach, the Nittany Lions also changed their uniforms by adding players’ names to the backs of the jerseys and blue ribbons to the back of the helmets as a symbol of support for victims of child sexual abuse.
However, these cosmetic changes did nothing to improve their playing, as the Nittany Lions let an 11-point halftime advantage slip away against Ohio and lost 24–14.
The on-field struggles did not go away as Penn State lost to Virginia Tech 17–16, following four missed field goals by kicker Sam Ficken.
The Nittany Lions’ defense looked in top form for most of the game, causing four turnovers, but the offense struggled and converted those chances into only three points.
Unfortunately, even the defense collapsed in crunch time as they gave up the winning 86-yard drive.
The mass exodus of players following the NCAA sanctions on Penn State football — including two key transfers, running back Silas Redd and kicker Anthony Fera — would have likely turned this heartbreaking loss into an easy win for the Nittany Lions.
Overall, the next few years are going to be rough for Pennsylvania college football fans. 
Pitt is trying to redefine itself with a new conference next season and is on its third head coach in as many years.
The ACC will offer stiffer competition for the Panthers, but will hopefully offer a larger national spotlight and allow Pitt to increase its recruiting base and regain its former glory. 
For Penn State, the road is not quite so easy. With a four-year bowl ban imposed as part of NCAA sanctions from the Sandusky scandal, the Nittany Lions will have trouble attracting top recruits with NFL aspirations.
There is hope, however, since many current players have chosen to stay with the team rather than transfer without penalty. Also, many recruits have kept their commitments.
Penn State fans are going to have to weather the rough seasons ahead with hopes that in four or five years, the Nittany Lions can return to the former glory that they had under Paterno.

The Carnegie Mellon Tartans defeated the Allegheny College Gators 37-7 last Saturday. With the win, the Tartans start the season 2-0.
Carnegie Mellon quickly took the lead after a 55-yard, eight-play drive that ended with a 27-yard field goal from first-year kicker Connor Young. After being down 3-0, the Gators responded with a 77-yard drive that ended with a one-yard touchdown run. 
After that score, Carnegie Mellon took control of the ball game and reeled off 34 unanswered points. The scoring frenzy began with a 9-yard sprint into the end zone by senior running back Patrick Blanks with 12:18 remaining in the second quarter.
Junior wide receiver Tim Kikta followed him into the end zone with a 39-yard touchdown catch from junior quarterback Rob Kalkstein to make it 17-7 going into half time.
Kikta and Kalkstein did not waste anytime increasing the lead on the first play of the Tartan’s second possession of the second half with an 82-yard touchdown. The score was 23-7 after Young missed the point after attempt wide right. 
Blanks followed suite with his second and third trips to the end zone to put the game out of reach at 37-7. He ended the game with 52 yards on 14 carries and three touchdowns.
Overall the Tartans had 461 yards of total offense with 261 coming on the ground. Kalkstein ended the game with two touchdowns and a career-high 200 passing yards.
Defensively, Carnegie Mellon excelled, holding the Gators to only 207 yard of total offense on the day. Junior safety Jack Butler and junior linebacker AK Brefo led the way, each with eight tackles.
"We lost to that team 3 years in a row. The win yesterday really shows the character of this team. It's great to see the team progressing week to week. Hopefully we carry this momentum into our next game...." Blanks said.
Carnegie Mellon plays next Friday at Gesling Stadium hosting Catholic University. Kickoff is set for 7:00 pm.

The men’s soccer team started its season strong at home with two victories. The team saw its first win over Hobart College with a 3–1 score, and its second was over seventh-ranked Stevens Institute of Technology at 1–0.
This past weekend, the Tartans played two more games. After falling 5–3 to Baldwin Wallace College, the team rebounded with a 3–2 win over Ohio Northern University. After only first two weeks of play, the Tartans come away with a 3–1 total record.
Currently, the men’s soccer team is ranked No. 13 in the nation.
The Tartans’ victories have been led by the upperclassmen. In the first game against Hobart, junior Matt Sarett scored the first goal for the Tartans to tie the game. Senior Alex Abedian scored second to put the Tartans at a 2–1 lead, before junior Max Tassano scored to increase the lead to 3–1 before the game ended.
The game against Stevens kept the attention of Tartan fans, as the game was tied 0–0 until the last 40 seconds of the game. 
The Tartans and their opponents went back and forth the entire game. Both teams had opportunities to score, but saves from junior goal keeper Chris Madden kept the Tartans in the game. The Steven’s goal keeper held his own as well until the last seconds when senior John Crawshaw scored the only goal of the game.
Despite losing against Baldwin Wallace, the Tartans still played a respectable game, scoring three goals. The first came from junior Mike Ferraco and the other two came from sophomores Louis Ferragonio and Daniel Kursman-Neri. It was Ferragonio’s first goal as a Tartan.
Against Ohio Northern, Abedian was back in action, scoring his second goal of the season. Senior Ben Bryant scored the second goal of the game for the Tartans before Tassano followed Abedian’s footsteps and scored his second goal of the season, sealing the victory.
The Tartans will travel to Geneva College on Wednesday for a 7 p.m. game. 
The team will then host Allegheny College on Saturday for a 1 p.m. game on the Tartans’ home turf, where they remain undefeated.

Students in the Tepper School of Business were disappointed to see that only 30 companies would be attending this year’s Business Opportunities Conference (BOC). This marks the fourth year in a row where employer attendance at the BOC has decreased from that of the previous year.
The BOC is an annual career fair at Carnegie Mellon where students network with recruiters for business internships and full-time positions. The BOC is run by the BOC committee, an undergraduate student organization. In addition to the BOC, the Carnegie Institute of Technology sponsors the Technical Opportunities Conference (TOC), a career fair for technical positions, while the Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC) hosts fall and spring Employment Opportunities Conferences (EOC), which are general career fairs.
This year’s BOC sees in particular the loss of “energy companies” from previous years. Companies like DC Energy, Direct Energy, and Tricon Energy all attended the BOC last year, but they will not return for the conference this time around. Major investment banks and consulting firms like JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Ernst & Young, and Accenture will also be absent.
Although these companies are still offering positions through TartanTrak, students at the BOC will miss out on networking opportunities. “Networking with recruiters really improves your chances of getting a job, so I’m disappointed that almost none of the companies I’m interested in are coming to the BOC,” said Michael Wang, a senior business administration major.
The co-chairs of this year’s BOC committee, seniors Brendan Casey and Olubunmi Dairo, could not be reached for comment.
The BOC’s decline stands in contrast to the growth in Carnegie Mellon’s other career fairs and career opportunities. “Last academic year employer attendance at the Spring EOC was up 13 percent and we anticipate an increase in this October’s Fall EOC. Job postings were up 51 percent and the number of on-campus interviews was up 72 percent,” said Wesley Thorne, associate director of employer relations and college liaison to Tepper for the CPDC, in an email.
The number of companies attending the TOC also grew from 240 in 2011 to 290 in this year’s conference.
Jennifer Frick, assistant director and career consultant in the CPDC for Tepper undergraduates, speculates that the career fair is still feeling the aftershocks of the 2008 financial crisis. “The decrease in BOC registrations likely reflects the decreased hiring in the financial services industry,” Frick said in an email. “2007 was one of our best years in terms of financial services recruiting, but with the problems in the financial sector after 2008, we have seen less hiring, especially from investment banks.”
Brandon Ngiam, a senior mathematical sciences major and member of the 2009 BOC committee, believes that the small number of students in Tepper does not make attending the BOC a worthwhile investment for businesses.
“Companies want to focus their recruiting efforts at large numbers of students, and because Tepper is smaller than other schools, that’s why the BOC is so much smaller than the TOC and EOC,” Ngiam said. “Enrollment at Tepper has also been decreasing, so that might explain why fewer companies are attending each year.” In 2008, undergraduate business enrollment was 428, while in 2011, it was only 354.
There might also be a self-perpetuating cycle contributing to the decline of the BOC and the growth of the other career fairs: Business students attend other career fairs due to the lack of companies at the BOC, while companies stop attending the BOC because they can recruit business students at other career fairs.
For example, Nikki Mistry, a senior business administration major, plans to go to the BOC, TOC, and the EOC to look for consulting positions. “Many of the firms I’m interested [in] are going to be at the TOC and EOC, but not the BOC,” Mistry said. “The TOC recruiters might not specifically be hiring for consulting, but I at least can pass along my résumé to them.”
Meanwhile, many consulting firms see that students like Mistry are attending the EOC and reason that attending the BOC is redundant. “We would see many of the same students at the BOC that we see at Carnegie Mellon’s other career fairs, like the EOC,” said Devin Carter, a recruiter for the consulting firm ZS Associates. “Since there is so much overlap, we don’t see the need to attend the BOC to recruit Carnegie Mellon students.”
It is unclear what next year’s BOC committee can do to reverse this trend. Ngiam suggests reducing the entrance fee. “It’s already a big commitment to fly out to Pittsburgh and attend the BOC, and we may not be providing companies with enough students and potential hires to justify the current entrance fee.” For-profit companies pay $500 for the basic package to host a booth at the BOC.
Mistry thinks that the BOC should involve the Tepper administration or the career center. “A big difference between the BOC and the  other career fairs is that the BOC is completely student-run, and I think that if the Tepper administration helped run the committee, we would see a lot more companies coming.” 
For now, to all the discouraged business students worried about their careers, Frick emphasized, “Remember that the job fairs are just one step in the recruiting process for many companies. Especially for BOC, many of the companies are returning later for on-campus interviews, case competitions, and other events such as information sessions that further allow them to connect with students.”

When the TOC and BOC conferences wrap up, many students may be left with unmet expectations. Whether looking for an internship or a full-time job, students still have a wide variety of options available to them.
Explore TartanTrak
While the conferences offer an excellent opportunity to meet with potential employers in person, students have a much larger pool of employers available to them year-round through TartanTrak, which offers over 11,000 company profiles. These 11,000 businesses currently offer around 2,200 positions for which Carnegie Mellon students can apply via the university’s online service.
The fairs “are wonderful opportunities for students to network with employers and to secure that first interview. But it is not the only way,” said Farouk Dey, the director of Carnegie Mellon’s Career and Professional Development Center (CPDC) in an interview two years ago.
“There are many employers who are out there who choose not to come to the conference for one reason or another but are still very interested in Carnegie Mellon students. The first place I would always send students to is TartanTrak,” Dey said. “I want to encourage every student, whether they get an interview or not, to go on TartanTrak and look up these employers.”
Students can visit TartanTrak to submit résumés, sign up for interviews, and explore job opportunities. Students can register for their TartanTrak login information at www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/career/students_alumni/tartantrak.html.
Expand professional networks
According to Dey, the majority of university students across the country find their jobs through previously established connections.
“Networking is really the No. 1 way people get jobs,” Dey said. “Occasionally these connections can be neighbors or family friends, but most of the time these are professional connections that students have developed through joining clubs, organizations, or committees.”
Dey said that students must first be aware of the contacts they have available to them and then leverage these connections. Many, however, wonder how exactly to begin taking advantage of their networks. According to Dey, it is often just a matter of getting the word out.
“The first place to start is to let people know that you’re looking — let your parents know, let your friends know, let your roommate know. Inform people that you are approaching graduation and are beginning to look for a full-time position,” Dey said. “Just the fact that you’re letting them know and asking them to keep you in mind if they hear about an opportunity increases your chances of being in the right place at the right time.”
Take advantage of online networking
The advantages of online networking are often not succesfully leveraged by students. The internet, along with tools such as Facebook and LinkedIn, give students the option of reaching hundreds, if not thousands, of their friends and acquaintances with one click of a mouse.
“One of the tools I often recommend is LinkedIn. It is fantastic because it not only allows you to document all the people in your professional network who you know, but it also allows you to tap into a larger network through those people,” Dey said.
As an example, Dey opened his own LinkedIn profile to show the power of the site. “This is my LinkedIn page and I use it very much. You can see I have 331 connections — these are people that I know personally through my career or some are also friends or acquaintances. Through these 331 connections I am then connected to 3,316,810 people,” Dey said.
Dey explained the power of such online networking services by giving a hypothetical example. “If I am interested in working for Intel, I can type ‘Intel’ into the LinkedIn search. The first people that show up in my list are the people who are connected to me but also have a strong connection to Intel. They may know someone else who works there, or have worked there themselves. The great part about this is I now know who to contact to begin my search. It is a powerful way to look for connections.”
Be persistent
For those students who may leave the conferences feeling let down, persistence will pay off, according to Dey. He believes that it is important to not give up when hunting for a job.
“Even the employers who you may have met at the [BOC/TOC/EOC] who maybe did not offer you an interview at the conference — it is okay to return to them and ask them to reconsider or if they have any other opportunities,” Dey said. 
“It really is a matter of engaging your professional associations, networking both online and in person, getting involved, and I would finish by telling students to not lose hope. Be persistent.”

When it comes to making a good first impression, appearance definitely matters. Carnegie Mellon students have a reputation of not caring too much about (supposedly) trivial things like attire. But at job fairs, recruiters are judging students not only by their résumés, but also the color of their suits. With this in mind, it is imperative that students look polished and conservative. Finding the right pair of heels or the perfect tie is just as important as fixing the formatting on your résumé.
Women
Since the dress code for the conferences is business formal, women should stick to a conservative suit or skirt in black, navy, or gray. Wearing a suit jacket is a must, or you will end up looking too casual for the event. Also, try to avoid wearing lacy or silky camisoles under your jacket. A crisp shirt in a solid color is a much better option — not only is it a safe, conservative bet, but it also looks smart.
When it comes to styling, all attempts should be made to create a clean and polished look. Hair should be tied back neatly in a pony tail or pinned back so that it doesn’t fall on the face. Nude pantyhose are a must if you are wearing a skirt, and if you are wearing a pant suit, wear thin, nude socks.
As for accessories, the choice of shoes is an important one. Don’t pick the stylish, open-toed heels you would wear on a night out. Instead, go with a sensible pair of pumps. A quick tip: Make sure you are comfortable in your heels. Job fairs involve a lot of waiting in lines, and you don’t want to be doing all of it with sore feet. Add some simple jewelry to make your look more elegant and attractive. Stay away from large, chunky necklaces and long, dangly earrings. Find simple studs and a small pendant that suit your outfit and you’re good to go.
Men
A business suit is a necessity for men. While colors like black, navy, and gray will all work, men can also impress in a pinstriped suit. A white shirt is the safest bet, and it is important to make sure the shirt cuffs are close to one-half of an inch longer than their jacket sleeves.
A special feature of the men’s look is the tie. Remember, the tie is supposed to serve as an accessory, not an attention-grabber; leave your Jerry Garcia tie at home and wear something more suited to the occasion. Additionally, if this is your first time tying a tie, practice a few times before the day of the conference; YouTube has some good video tutorials. Make sure your tie is not too long and hanging below your belt, or too short and stopping above it.
An important thing to keep in mind is that even though you may have put the perfect outfit together, all of it will amount to nothing if you are not confident about your appearance. While adhering to the dress code and smartening up your attire are essential, remaining cool and confident is even more important.

When going to the BOC or TOC, it is important to have a strong résumé to make you stand out from all the other candidates — in a good way, of course. Here are some short, informal guidelines for those who have never written a résumé before.
Header
In the heading, the name comes first, and you want that to be the most prominent part. Make it noticeable, under 40 point font, and either left-align or center-align it. A bold name in a formal serif (Garamond, Jenson, Trajan) will suffice. The address at which the writer receives most of his or her mail, as well as a phone number and email address, should also be in the heading. If you have a personal website, list it there as well.
Education
The education section is where you should put intended majors or minors (if relevant), expected graduation date, and the name and location of your school. Once in college, you should try to avoid placing your high school on your résumé. You can include your college GPA if it is high — especially if you are a Dean’s List honoree. If your GPA is poor, leave it off — if recruiters really want to know, they will ask.
Experience
Here is the trickiest — and most important — part of your résumé. When listing your experiences, you should choose the ones that connect your skills to the qualifications that the job asks for. However, don’t copy full-length sentences from the job advertisement.
What you should do is try to articulate your skills in a way that sounds similar to the skills the employer is looking for in a candidate. Eliminate use of the first-person (“I did ...”) if possible, and don’t forget to use active verbs when listing the tasks your job entailed. For example, “Flipped burgers” (don’t put that on your résumé) is the correct verb form to use. You should also try to use bulleted lists to make it easier to scan the information. And stay concise — no one wants to read eight paragraphs about your retail experience.
Activities
In some cases, your activities might even be more relevant than your actual work experience, and should thus be as boldly and centrally placed. You should try your best to list your most relevant activities. For example, if you are applying for a web design internship, list related activities: copy-writing, search engine optimization, or visual design experience, to give a few examples.
As for other extra-curricular activities, you should highlight activities you’re involved in — a club for which you only attended a single meeting doesn’t count. As always, either cut out irrelevant information or find a way to tie it into the way you sell yourself.
Skills
This is where you advertise any skills that haven’t been addressed in the other sections. Be sure you are actually advertising real skills, not generic qualities that anyone can claim. List languages you speak and languages you code in. List a hobby or two that an interviewer might connect with and use to better understand you as a person.
Take your résumé seriously, and have someone like an adviser look over it because their advice will be tremendously valuable. If you don’t, you could make silly mistakes, and your résumé might be perceived as a joke. It will provide the employer with a good laugh, but that is probably not what you are aiming for. Try to be professional, or at least try not to do something foolish.

A 2006 study by the National Science Board found that “most Americans do not understand the scientific process and therefore may lack a valuable tool for assessing the validity of various claims they encounter in daily life.” With this as motivation, Pittsburgh will serve as the pilot city this fall for the Science & Engineering Ambassador Program, which aims to better connect scientists and engineers to the local community.
Implemented by the National Academy of Science and National Academy of Engineering, the program consists of a team of science and engineering ambassadors who will work “to improve the public understanding of and engagement with energy-related issues,” according to the program’s website.
The initial set of ambassadors has already been selected and is comprised of local scientists and engineers with areas of expertise related to the energy industry. These ambassadors come from both industry and nonprofit organizations, and include professors from the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon. In fact, four of the nine appointed ambassadors are affiliated with Carnegie Mellon; this group includes engineering and public policy professors Jay Apt and Edward Rubin, chemical engineering professor Neil Donahue, and materials science and engineering professor Robert Davis.
“People are disconnected, from an engineering perspective, from the very things that they hold dear,” Davis said. Davis acknowledged that there are existing challenges to connecting people with science, and in identifying problems such as lack of access, knowledge, and interest in understanding the science and technology that drives society today.
The program website explains that one of the reasons Pittsburgh was selected as a pilot city is due to the diversity of individuals and groups who are interested in the matter of energy. At least five different energy sectors — including coal, gas, nuclear, solar, and wind — are represented in the region. The area also boasts a wealth of natural resources that continues to draw the interest of investors and researchers alike.  
In addition to the considerable industry presence in the area, Pittsburgh is also home to universities with a number of researchers focusing their efforts on energy issues. It is this combination of relevant industrial and academic presence that has made Pittsburgh a top contender for the program.
Davis likened the structure and goals of the ambassador program to a scientific experiment: The program will test whether increasing the visibility and availability of science and engineering experts will increase public engagement with scientific issues.
To bridge the gap, the program will provide training for the ambassadors in audio and visual communication with the intention of linking them with local professionals such as teachers, business leaders, or members of the media. 
Because the program is still in its infancy, there are still many unknowns about how to stimulate public interest and concern with issues of science, but Davis offered this thought: “We’ll learn by doing. We’ll learn by trying, [to see] what — if anything — works. But not trying is even worse.”

Carl Doersch, a doctoral student studying machine learning, and his colleagues have developed new graphical software capable of identifying stylistic features of cities. The team, composed of researchers from both Carnegie Mellon and the Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique, has published its work in the computer graphics journal ACM Transactions on Graphics.
The process of finding related patterns between images is known as visual data mining. Project collaborator Alexei Efros, an associate professor of robotics and computer science at Carnegie Mellon, pointed out that the science is still relatively new.
“The field of visual data mining is still in its infancy, but I believe it holds a lot of promise,” he said in a university press release. “Our data mining technique was able to go through millions of [images] automatically — something that no human would be patient enough to do.”
The researchers’ full data set actually contained a quarter of a billion images. They were collected from Google Street View.
The group’s program works by parsing through a given set of captured city imagery, identifying the elements of that city’s architecture or scenery that may help distinguish it from other cities. Specifically, the algorithm looks for representative features of a city — features that are both frequent, like trees, and specific, like Paris’ Eiffel Tower.
For example, the algorithm labeled window balustrades, traditional street signs, distinct lampposts, balcony supports, and doors as some of the representative features of Paris. London, on the other hand, sports a combination of neoclassical columns, Victorian windows, and cast-iron fencing, all coming together to give each city a unique look.
But extracting these rare, indicative markers was no easy task. Doersch compared the process to that of finding needles in a haystack.
“It was quite a challenge to find an algorithm that could reliably sift through all the uninteresting [images] without throwing out the needles,” he said.
Despite the challenges, the researchers had considerable success with their algorithm’s accuracy. European cities like Paris, London, Prague, Milan, and Barcelona — which have had distinctive architectural styles for centuries — proved especially responsive to the algorithm. However, there has been some difficulty getting it to work with cities in the U.S.
“When we tried our algorithm on American cities, we found considerably less [features] than in European cities,” Doersch said. “Maybe this isn’t so surprising though, since the U.S. is in many ways a melting pot of cultures. Usually each city has so many different architectural influences that no single architectural style can dominate.”
The researchers presented their findings at SIGGRAPH, an annual conference about advancements in computer graphics, earlier this month. “I spoke to quite a few people afterward who wanted to know more and were interested in taking it further,” Doersch said.
One practical usage for the team’s research includes the potential for a computer-assisted analysis of the spread of certain architectural styles across a given area. Doersch also highlighted another, perhaps more interesting, application.
“Computer animators often have to build models of cities,” he said. “For example, for the movie Ratatouille, Pixar built a model of Paris.”
Doersch explained that to do this, the animators spent a few weeks in Paris carefully studying and taking pictures of the architecture in order to decide what to put in the façades to make them look Parisian.
“Our algorithm could help automate this process, providing a way to organize the collections of reference photos so that the animators can get a more complete picture of the city faster,” Doersch said.

Whether it was a day at the beach, working in the yard, or being lazy by the pool, your skin had been subjected to the damaging effects of the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays. Your result — either a painful burn or a healthy glow — probably depended on the use of (or lack of) one indispensable item: sunscreen.
As its name suggests, sunscreen protects you from the sun’s harmful UV rays — rays whose wavelengths are shorter than those of visible light. And while most of the sun’s rays are UV, our atmosphere and ozone layer are able to filter out much of this damaging radiation.
The UV light that gets by, however, is harmful to the DNA in our skin; it results in a tan (yes, tans are signs of damage), burns, or even skin cancer with chronic exposure. The three types of UV radiation are UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C, from longest to shortest wavelength, respectively. Of the three, UV-B rays are the ones that cause sunburn, while UV-A can cause damage within the skin, contributing to skin cancer.
If the sun leaves you with a nasty burn, it’s a sign that the UV-B rays have damaged your skin cells. According to Discovery Health, skin cells that are the most susceptible to burn are those without any sort of melatonin — typically found in Caucasians without any sort of tan. When these cells get damaged, the body increases blood flow to the dermis, the second layer of skin, to bring in new cells that will repair the damage.
Sunscreen protects the skin from this invisible light through its unique chemical composition of inorganic and organic materials. The inorganic particles, such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, act as a sort of UV armor. The small particles sit on the skin and reflect the wavelengths of UV-B light. But many old sunscreens, since they depend primarily on inorganic materials, were thick and greasy.
Companies combat this issue with lighter, synthetic organic components that work by absorbing the UV light and then releasing the stored energy. According to a study by the University of Athens Medical School in Greece, these particles, such as octyl methoxycinnamate, gain energy when exposed to the UV rays and then release the energy through either heat release or isomerization — when a molecule rearranges its atoms. Additionally, many of the newer sunscreens have tiny inorganic particles of about 45 nanometers in size. For comparison, a sheet of paper is roughly 100,000 nanometers thick.
The SPF on sunscreens, or “Sun Protection Factor,” is meant to give an estimate for the rate of UV-B absorption, as well as the duration of how long the sunscreen is effective. To determine the effective duration of sun protection, simply multiply the SPF by 10. For example, SPF 10 will grant roughly 100 minutes of protection. 
However, in terms of UV-B absorption, there is a ceiling to the SPF: With SPF 45 protecting from 98 percent of the sun’s UV-B rays, anything greater is “just silly,” James Spenser, the spokesman for the American Academy of Dermatology, told WebMD.
For optimal skin safety, use the entire recommended dose of sunscreen. It might seem that sunscreen manufacturers just want people to use more of their product, but in a recent article published in International Journal of Pharmaceuticals, researchers found that using less than the standard amount of sunscreen will increase the chances of getting burned.
It’s also important to remember that people can get burned during any season. Plenty of UV rays reach the ground any season of the year — not just summer. So whenever you’re planning on doing any activities out in the sun, remember to apply your inorganic and organic particles liberally. You’ll save your skin, and possibly your life.

Snails carry foreign eggs on their backs
Scientists recently found that a species of snails called solenosteira macrospira carry eggs that don’t belong to them on their backs. In most snail species, the female deposits the eggs into sand or attaches them to a rock after fertilization. However, female solenosteira macrospira attach their eggs onto their partners’ backs. Snails have several partners during their mating period, so these eggs often don’t belong to the snail they end up attached to.
Suzanne Alonzo, an ecology professor at Yale University, explained why a male snail would agree to this: “So as long as he mates with [a female] and sires a bunch of offspring, it doesn’t really matter if they’re on his back or someone else’s back.”

‘Junk’ DNA plays crucial role in body
Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz recently found out that parts of DNA previously considered to be useless are actually essential in making the body function properly. About 80 percent of what scientists previously considered “junk” DNA acts as a switch for other parts of the DNA. Scientists previously thought only 5 to 10 percent of DNA was useful.
This “junk” controls which parts of the DNA will be active and scientists have linked these gene switches to everything from rheumatoid arthritis to height. This discovery could provide certain cancer treatments by controlling the switches that might lead to cancer instead of attempting to control the disease itself.

Scientists teleport quantum states
A team of scientists in Vienna transmitted tiny pieces of information known as quantum states over 143 kilometers using quantum teleportation. Scientists encoded this information into photons, and then transferred these photons between the Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife. The distance of 143 kilometers was used as the milestone since it is the minimum distance between the Earth and orbiting satellites.
Scientists argue the technology is useful for applications in secure communication and that one of its advantages over other communications technology is that it can theoretically work over any distance without taking additional time as distance increases.

Deep-sea crabs color-code food
Crabs that live a half-mile deep in the ocean may be using a novel way to protect themselves from toxic food. While these crabs don’t see sunlight, they are sensitive to blue and ultraviolet (UV) light. Duke University biologist Sönke Johnsen explained that the crabs use their sensitivity to “sort out the likely toxic corals they’re sitting on, which glow, or bioluminesce, blue-green and green, from the plankton they eat, which glow blue.”
Certain crab species were found to have separate channels for processing blue and UV light, giving them a form of color vision they could use to pick out food. Next, the researchers have to test these crabs in conditions closer to their natural habitat.

Voyager 1 will soon leave solar system
For a machine with only 68 kilobytes of memory and an eight-track tape recorder, the Voyager 1 has accomplished a lot in its 35 years of exploration. For the last few months, Voyager 1 has been exploring a turbulent and hot plasma bubble at the edge of the solar system. Once the satellite leaves the outer edge, it is expected to encounter a much calmer climate. 
Scientists have recently seen new data coming in from the spacecraft, which originally departed Earth in 1977, that shows the spacecraft is at the edge of crossing over. Given that the Voyager 1 has enough fuel to last until 2020, there should be plenty of time for scientists to get information about stars they’ve never had access to before.

Exploding stars may affect climate
The temperature on Earth could be affected in part by forces beyond human control, like how often stars explode. “When a star explodes, a massive amount of cosmic rays enter the atmosphere affecting the weather in space by making it cloudier. More clouds in space leads to the Earth’s atmosphere, being cooler,” astrophysicist Charles Wang of Scotland’s University of Aberdeen said. Hence, the more stars that explode in a year, the cooler the Earth’s temperature will be, according to Wang. On average, one stars explodes in every galaxy every year, releasing a huge amount of energy and cosmic rays.

“Feminism is not just about women and not just about identity politics. It’s a way of thinking, and it affects everything.”
Visitors to the Mattress Factory’s latest exhibition, Feminist and..., will likely be surprised at its content. While all of the pieces are clearly based on an understanding of feminist ideals, they are not overtly about feminist issues. But as curator Hilary Robinson noted above, feminism is a way of thinking, not a set of beliefs. In fact, much of the “feminism” in the exhibit is actually what viewers bring with them when they walk through the door.
The exhibit, which is guest-curated by Robinson — a professor of art theory and criticism at Carnegie Mellon — features work by six female artists from around the world: Ayanah Moor, Julia Cahill, Parastou Forouhar, Carrie Mae Weems, Loraine Leeson, and Betsy Damon. Together, their work shows that feminism is not a single set of political beliefs; rather, it is as diverse as the art world itself: multivocal, multigenerational, and multicultural.
The idea for the exhibit came to Robinson three years ago after she saw a presentation by Weems responding to the election of President Barack Obama. “I thought, here is this woman who I know is a feminist, who has been informed by feminist thinking, responding to a historical moment,” Robinson said.
The idea of women’s responses to historic events — and how their experiences and cultures shape that response — was the basis for the exhibit. Indeed, each of the artists in the exhibit offers a unique perspective, reacting to what she sees as feminism in an individualized way.
The highlight of the exhibit is Forouhar’s “Written Room,” in which she covered the walls and floor of a room with Farsi script. Because the text is incomprehensible to those who can’t read Farsi — the majority of Western viewers — it becomes pure ornament and viewers are forced to either accept that they cannot read it or project meaning onto it.
Surrounded by the patterns on all sides, viewers are completely immersed in the script and are likely to assume that it says something meaningful and exotic — when, in fact, the script is just a jumble of letters and syllables. “The whole point of it is that it’s nonsense.... We can project meaning onto it, but really there’s nothing there. But as Westerners, we really have no idea,” Robinson explained.
In the room behind Forouhar’s piece is Weems’ “Lincoln, Lonnie and Me — A Story in 5 Parts,” an 18-minute video projection project. The video is projected into the black space between bright red theater curtains, creating a ghostly effect. Weems’ work investigates family relationships, gender roles, and the histories of racism, sexism, class, and other political systems. Through its video clips and voice-overs, her piece presents a strong call to action and reminds us that we cannot engage in thoughtful debate when we all have strong preconceived notions of what is right. Through her piece, she encourages viewers to remember what women are fighting for now and what they have been fighting for throughout history.
The youngest of the six artists, Cahill presented the most obvious feminist piece in the exhibit. Cahill, who graduated from Carnegie Mellon with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in May, typically works with performance and video art to present her commentary on pop culture. For her piece for Feminist and..., “Breasts in the Press,” Cahill rewrote the lyrics to “My Humps,” a pop song by the Black Eyed Peas. “I like to look at songs that are sung by female pop stars that are often seen as empowering, but when you actually look at the song lyrics it’s quite the opposite,” she said.
Small videos of Cahill performing her reworded song are projected onto a large statue reminiscent of Venus de Milo — just with much larger breasts.
“I basically just gave her a boob job with plaster,” Cahill said. Explaining her decision to exaggerate the sculpture’s female form, she said, “What I really love to do with my work is get a message across through humor. And it’s a challenge because I don’t want to make it seem like I’m making fun of issues — it’s a very fine line. I want people to laugh a little bit but realize that it’s something very serious.”
On the whole, the exhibit does an excellent job of representing a wide range of perspectives on feminism. While each of the pieces certainly has some feminist undertones, it’s not intimidating to those unfamiliar with feminist theory. The pieces are not overtly about feminism or feminist issues, but the title of the exhibit invites viewers to interpret each of the pieces with their idea of feminism in mind.
While this abstraction makes the exhibit very accesible to a wide audience, it does leave something to be desired. Without paying very close attention or having background knowledge of the artists, it can be unclear what some of the pieces are trying to say. The descriptions provided in the gallery guide give some information, but they are hardly enough to understand the point of the exhibit.
In the end, though, the exhibit is not about what we typically think of as feminism, and leaving it open for interpretation is more realistic of the movement itself. As Robinson put it, “[Feminist and...] says that feminism is not something of the 1970s.... Feminism is important, and it is urgent.”
Feminist and... will be open at the Mattress Factory (500 Sampsonia Way) until May 26.

In 2008, the alternative hip-hop group Das Racist released a song, still heard today ringing from those gigantic speakers by the Fence, called “Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.” The main refrain (and there are no verses, just refrain) goes:
I’m at the Pizza Hut;
I’m at the Taco Bell;
I’m at the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.
After Das Racist’s performance in Rangos Sept. 1, presented by AB Coffeehouse, I was inspired to do a rhetorical analysis to get to the bottom of one of the deep mysteries of our time. Why is this song so popular, and what is it about the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell (CPHTB)?
1. Repetition
Roman rhetorician Quintilian said in Book 8 of his Institutio Oratio that rhetorical ornament like repetition “contributes not a little to the furtherance of our case as well. For when our audience find it a pleasure to listen, their attention and their readiness to believe what they hear are both alike increased, while they are generally filled with delight, and sometimes even transported by admiration.”
Similarly, in an interview with the Village Voice, Das Racist MC Himanshu Suri (Heems) noted: “My top five favorite poetic devices of all time are repetition, repetition, repetition, repetition, and repetition.”
Suri isn’t alone. Pop artists often use repetition in their songs to fill listeners with delight and transport them by admiration. Just think of John Mayer’s “Say,” Lady Gaga’s “Edge of Glory,” and Britney Spears’ “Womanizer.” People paradoxically love these songs and hate them, buying millions of copies even as they declare them to be insipid, vapid drivel because of their repetitiousness.
In this light, “Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell” can be read as counter-drivel. By caricaturing the trope of repetition into a grotesque parody, Das Racist makes an epistemic claim on repetition. After all, compared to “Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell,” the repetition in Justin Bieber’s “Baby” is so derivative. Das Racist thus allows hipsters to protest corporate patterns of commercialization through their appreciation for pop music’s repetition as derivative — Das Racist fills them with delight, indeed.
2. Socioeconomic representations
There’s no getting around it: CPHTBs are not high class. Wall Street is not eager to hold business meetings at CPHTBs. The perfect date night does not usually include a CPHTB. In fact, with gas station snacks from Sheetz coming in at a close second, a CPHTB is food’s equivalent of a brothel: late-night, cheap, guilt-inducing indulgences in saturated fat and grease.
As obesity rates soar in America, especially among the lower class, it’s no wonder that the nearest rhyme Das Racist can think of for “Pizza Hut” is “pizza gut,” and for “Taco Bell,” “taco smell” (and from there, to rolling “L”s — CPHTBs go hand-in-hand with drug use). Many of us have experienced such places. But has Mitt Romney ever been to a CPHTB?
By choosing a socioeconomically loaded location, Das Racist allows audiences to identify with the common man. Real conversations take place by the people and for the people in local CPHTBs, not in Washington surrounded by wealthy delegates from around the country. Ever since the song’s release four years ago, it seems like everyone is at a CPHTB. Solidarity comes from shared experiences like these.
3. Semantic confusion
With such simple, emphatic lyrics, “Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell” must carry a clear message, right? Close inspection, however, twists such dreams as Das Racist pulls us into a crisis of geographic (and personal) ambiguity.
In the first iteration, “I” am at the CPHTB. In the second iteration, a second voice says “I” am at the CPHTB. Then three times “we” are at the CPHTB. This is representative of a traditional discovery of community centered around a culturally constructed place.
But then the pronouns fade and all the listener hears is the identification of the place. Has individuality been subsumed in common purposes? Has eating limited personal expression?
“Wait, wait.” After another round of “I,” Das Racist delves into the personal consequences of CPHTBs, then fades back into reiteration of the CPHTB. While “I” dominates the rest of the song, it is no longer an unambiguous “I” with unambiguous location. Rather, the two “I”s are contrasted and put in tension.
I’m at the Pizza Hut.
(No, you ain’t.)
I’m at the Taco Bell!
(I’m over here!)
I’m at the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, where you at?
(I don’t see you!)
Here the failure to focus their two “I”s/eyes leads to disorientation and blindness. The “combination” of the two restaurants in one is a disaster, as the I-you duality breaks down and we are forced into the post-modern condition.
The confusion continues. The background beat becomes more insistent and distracting. A street name is discussed to no avail. We are in danger of losing touch with the place and people we identified with so strongly at the beginning of the song. Then, with a quick laugh — as at a joke — unity is restored and the harmonious “I” reemerges.
The drama works to reinforce the listener’s faith in the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. Over time, we are persuaded that, through mutual cooperation, society can emerge with resounding clarity and feeling. Our spirits cry out as one, “I’m at the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell!”
Editor’s Note: Will Penman is a first-year rhetoric Ph.D. student.

An explosion of 1960s rock and roll known as Jersey Boys has made its way to Pittsburgh, and is playing at the Benedum Center until Sept. 23. This hit Broadway musical outlines famous pop band Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons’ rise to fame. The tour production opened last Tuesday and has already begun playing to full houses. The current cast features two Carnegie Mellon alumni, both of whom give stellar performances.
Jersey Boys tells the story of Frankie Valli and his journey from being a boy with talent to an international superstar. Act I revolves around Tommy DeVito and his attempts to create a successful music quartet; the second half of the musical focuses on the now-successful quartet and its troubles with fame, money, and family.
Despite its small size, the cast of the production is fantastic. Brad Weinstock steals the show as the iconic Frankie Valli, and his performance is supported by an unforgettable Tommy DeVito, played by Colby Foytik. Jason Kappus is extremely entertaining as Bob Gaudio, and although Brandon Andrus is the least featured among the four, he is memorable as Nick Massi.
The staging throughout the show is sleek and the transitions are smooth. Pop art images are displayed on an electronic billboard that flies over the stage in nearly every scene. This vibrant display is a clever method of introducing scene changes and helps keep the transitions moving.
Jersey Boys acts as a time warp, transporting the audience back to the 1960s. Eye-catching costumes, thrilling music, and traditional set pieces all add to the ’60s atmosphere. The show features several hit songs such as “Walk Like a Man,” “Bye Bye Baby,” and the show favorite, “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You.”
The musical is fast paced, with many small character roles in addition to the four main actors. Among them is Valli’s girlfriend Loraine, played by Carnegie Mellon alumna Kaleigh Cronin. Cronin, who graduated in 2011 with a degree in musical theatre, plays a total of 18 different characters in the show. “There are only three women in the show; we play over 50 parts combined,” Cronin said. “And that’s everything from waitresses to the boys’ mothers and girlfriends and nurses.”
Also part of the cast is Skye Scott, a 2010 alum of the Carnegie Mellon musical theatre program. Like Cronin, Scott plays multiple characters in the show, although his primary character is Billy Dixon. “It’s really exciting every night to go through this journey of playing so many different people,” Scott said. “It’s a little crazy because you’re changing costumes constantly and backstage is very hectic, but it’s a blast.”
Jersey Boys requires actors to make quick costume and set changes; however, Scott and Cronin both attest that their time at Carnegie Mellon trained them well for this type of show.
In her senior year, Cronin was one of three actors in a show called Vanishing Point. “I had to play a million parts in that,” Cronin explained, “and it really prepared me for an experience like Jersey Boys. Lots of costume changes, jumping between voices and characters. That was actually the perfect segway into my role in Jersey Boys.”
With its classic music and great American success story, it’s no wonder that Jersey Boys is drawing in theater patrons from across the country. So far, the show has experienced an enthusiastic reception from the public — even at the preview night last Tuesday. “Usually for preview nights, people aren’t so responsive,” Cronin said, “but it was awesome. There were tons of people there and the crowd was great.”
The tour cast has been making its way across the nation for nearly a year, and Pittsburgh is just one stop of many. As Scott put it, “We’re getting paid to tour the country and experience every city. We’ve been doing the show for 10 months now.... We’re really in a great groove now with the show.”
Indeed, this “groove” is evident throughout the performance as all of the actors change roles seamlessly and maintain their energy throughout the performance. “_Jersey Boys_ is the most amazing show. It appeals to everyone,” Cronin said. “I used to think it was a show for people my grandparents’ age, but it really is so much fun.”
Jersey Boys runs through Sept. 23 at the Benedum Center (803 Liberty Ave.).

Last fall, when I would tell people that I was spending the following semester studying abroad in the Czech Republic, I invariably received two questions: “Do you even know Czech?” and “Do you at least know someone else studying abroad there too?” When I cheerily replied, “Nope!” to both those questions, it was followed (usually a bit incredulously) by, “Then, why would you pick the Czech Republic, of all places?”
I wanted a city where I could take classes in English; a city that was in Europe but wasn’t the usual Western European or Mediterannean locale to which so many American students tend to flock; and, to put it bluntly, a city that was cheap. Prague fit all of those criteria perfectly. Plus, as someone with a minor in history, I couldn’t resist the opportunity to visit a city that was a thousand years old — and that had been part of the Soviet bloc, a fact that piqued my geeky interest.
Now that I’m back from Prague, people often ask me how my semester abroad was. I’m not quite as quick to answer this question, as it’s difficult to summarize my experiences in and feelings about Prague in a few brief sentences.
Prague is a gorgeous city; the Vltava River winds through its heart, dividing neighborhoods packed with cobblestone streets, elaborately designed churches, and beautiful old buildings. Unlike most European cities, Prague wasn’t bombed during either of the World Wars, meaning that many of its historic buildings and sites are still standing. From the 1,000-year-old Prague Castle complex and the Charles Bridge — which dates back to the 14th century — to the ordinary restaurants and apartment buildings that are hundreds of years old, the history was practically palpable on every street I walked down. I still remember how mind-blowing it was on my first day of classes to realize that my university building predated the formation of the United States.
It wasn’t just the ancient history of Prague that fascinated me, though. Between the Nazi occupation and the communist regime, the 20th century was not kind to the Czech Republic; and, despite the city’s best efforts, not every scar of the communist regime has been eradicated from Prague. Every monument to Soviet leaders may have been pulled down, but you can still occasionally find relief sculptures celebrating the working class tattooed on the side of an apartment building.
Occasional Soviet architectural ghosts aside, Prague truly is beautiful. Many of my favorite days in the city were spent merely wandering the streets, my shoes wearing thin from the cobblestones as I walked down every side street to see what I could discover. I wanted to explore every park, every red-shingled apartment building, every massive Gothic church that I could find. By the end of my semester there, I knew the city well enough to get around nearly anywhere, and I had stared at the skyline so often I could picture it with my eyes closed.
When I wasn’t learning as much as I could about the physical layout of Prague, I was trying to discover everything I could about the Czech culture — and there was certainly plenty to explore. Prague is practically overflowing with the arts: Art galleries, book stores, and jazz clubs can be found on every street, and there are plenty of theater performances — including many in English — to choose from every night. Best of all, everything was relatively inexpensive, meaning that I could go to museums, concerts, and galleries and still have enough Czech crowns left to go out with my friends in the evening.
Perhaps the greatest thing about living in Prague was the people. Czechs are incredibly reserved in public — they are suspicious of strangers when they try to strike up conversation, and even making accidental eye contact on the tram is embarrassing for them — but they’re incredibly warm and friendly once you get to know them.
I also got to know many members of the English-speaking expatriate community; there are thousands of native English speakers living in Prague because they love the city, and many of them are interesting people dedicated to enjoying their life abroad. It made for a much slower lifestyle than here at Carnegie Mellon, which took some getting used to, but I learned to relax and appreciate the moment more, rather than just rush off to the next class or extracurricular activity.
This doesn’t even begin to cover all the incredible memories I have of Prague and all of the anecdotes I have about the city’s history, and yet it still doesn’t succinctly answer the question “How was your semester abroad?” The best answer that I have to settle for, then, is that it was a semester in a mind-bogglingly beautiful place; a semester in which I did more and learned more than I ever would have expected.

It’s tough being the quintessential hipster band of the new millennium.
Animal Collective didn’t create this label, of course, but the group of post-twenty-somethings (a.k.a. “thirty-somethings”) certainly asked for it: The lyrics are rambling and frequently silly, the beat is complex and interesting, and — most importantly — the group's members experiment with so many different styles that it’s difficult to label theirs as one type of music.
Take Animal Collective’s progression over the years. The group has felt the need to morph itself, from the twitches and yelps of 2004’s high-strung [ITAL]Sung Tongs[ITAL] to the laid-back "wa-was" of the band’s big hit [ITAL]Merriweather Post Pavilion[ITAL]. One would assume, then, that the new album [ITAL]Centipede Hz[ITAL] would keep moving in that direction, perhaps with less focus on the vocals than ever before.
With [ITAL]Centipede Hz[ITAL], the band takes two drastic departures from the feel-good albums of its recent past. The first is that the band’s members wrote and recorded this album all together in the same location — a rare treat. And second, perhaps influenced by the previous fact, they break the progression, making an album that sounds more like a synthesis of old and new, a coupling of the concentrated vocals of early albums and the laid-back nature of newer ones. 
The album’s first song, “Moonjock,” is a perfect example of the album’s entire aesthetic, and is proof that the band’s break from a chill indie style was deliberate. “This is the new,” says a distant radio announcer, and then come some crashes that would make any regular listener of [ITAL]Merriweather Post Pavilion[ITAL] jump. When founding member Avey Tare comes in with his vocals, it becomes apparent that this is still feel-good music — just a little more spastic and crazy than the Collective’s albums since 2007. 
[ITAL]Centipede Hz[ITAL] should be great. It should take what worked from all their previous albums and modify it to near perfection, expertly balancing lush and brittle. And they nearly make it, but there’s something a little off-putting about most of the songs, especially for those who have followed Animal Collective since its early days: The only new thing about [ITAL]Centipede Hz[ITAL] is that there’s nothing new.
On every Collective album up to now, the band has always had something original to offer, a new soundscape for the listener to traverse. [ITAL]Centipede Hz[ITAL] feels like a mash-up of its styles before and after 2007’s [ITAL]Strawberry Jam[ITAL], and that can be a bit disappointing when experiencing the album.
Although there’s nothing truly original on this album, that doesn’t mean that it’s not a good listen. Animal Collective knows by now how to make great album pieces, and in [ITAL]Centipede Hz[ITAL] each song flows into the next flawlessly. “Applesauce” is a bubbly, nonsensical, and thoroughly enjoyable song, and listening to “Wide Eyed” — which has Deakin on vocals, a welcome change from Tare’s howls — elicits a vision of a huge crowd swaying and shouting along. “Today’s Supernatural,” the most advertised song from the album, is certainly the most mainstream-sounding piece, which coming from Animal Collective is a bit strange. But it’s a pretty great song, nonetheless.
This album would be a great listen for those who want an introduction to Animal Collective, since — while it’s not exactly indicative of everything the band's done so far — it still showcases what the band is capable of.

In the midst of the stately turn-of-the-century high rises and gleaming skyscrapers of Downtown, the ToonSeum makes a colorful statement. In the front window, in the midst of a number of other whimsical decorations, a small Batarang inconspicuously hints at the comic wonders that can be found inside. Pittsburgh as Gotham City, a special exhibit that opened July 21, features all things that combine Batman and Pittsburgh, from comics to film paraphernalia.
The recent hype from the release of The Dark Knight Rises is clearly a driving force behind the exhibit; however, the ToonSeum has done justice to the entire franchise by including an array of merchandise from throughout the years.
The exhibit features numerous attractions, not the least of which is a wall of Batman comic panels from a variety of Pittsburgh artists that pays homage not only to the longevity of the legend, but also to the tremendous skill of local illustrators. The collection ranges from Pittsburgh Post-Gazette artist Rob Rogers’ biting political cartoons to dramatic scenes depicted in DC Comics’ books, and all feature a familiar masked figure.
One wall of the exhibit shows a video screen with clips from the cartoon series and the recent films, while a speaker blares a dramatic soundtrack to enhance the overall experience. Alongside the video clips, several mock-official Gotham City Police dossiers on “criminals” hang on the wall — all about actors from the series who have connections to Pittsburgh.
In fact, many of the “criminals” are Carnegie Mellon alumni, including Ming Na (the voice of Dectective Ellen Yin in the animated series), Frank Gorshin (the voice of Professor Hugo Strange in the animated series), and Lou Scheimer (who produced the series for several years).
Fans with a passion for behind-the-scenes glimpses of The Dark Knight Rises will go batty for the original concept art and location research photos on loan from Warner Bros. that adorn the walls of the exhibit. The photos and sketches feature scenes from around town, some of which are close to home for Carnegie Mellon students, including the Mellon Institute and the Software Engineering Institute. All of the scenes — especially the striking photo of a destroyed Heinz Field — are easily recognizable, both from the movie and from walking around town.
The highlight of the exhibit is undoubtedly the Batman mask, which sits in a glass case in the middle of the room. The mask on display was worn by Christian Bale in the most recent installment of The Dark Knight and allows visitors a quick and iconic glimpse at the costuming magic of the film.
Pittsburgh as Gotham City offers an in-depth look at the Batman franchise, from the original comics to the television series and films. Even if you’re not a Batman aficionado, the exhibit is an interesting look at Pittsburgh’s affiliation with the franchise and is well worth the trip to the ToonSeum. The behind-the-scenes photos are fascinating, and Batman’s connection to the city is enough to make any resident proud. 
The ToonSeum is located at 945 Liberty Ave. in the Cultural District. The exhibit runs through Oct. 7.

Coming from anyone else, the phrase, “As an individual, you can be more powerful than a whole country,” would seem hopelessly naïve.
But for Ai Weiwei, Chinese artist, dissident, and the subject of the recent documentary Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry, this statement is not only obvious fact — it may as well be the motto for his life’s work.
Never Sorry, currently playing at the Harris Theater in Downtown, chronicles Ai’s life and work in protest against an oppressive political regime. Famed for his incendiary and often profane artistic voice, Ai frequently found himself at odds with the Chinese government — from publicly criticizing the 2008 Beijing Olympics to investigating the deaths of thousands of schoolchildren in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Although it does not focus on Ai’s artistic ventures, Never Sorry perfectly balances political context with Ai’s rich personal story.
Created by first-time director Alison Klayman during her time as a freelance journalist in China, the film has won several international awards, including the Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival and Official Selection at the Berlin International Film Festival. According to the documentary website, the film aims to highlight a digital-age dissident who inspires on a global scale through a combination of art and politics.
Never Sorry slowly draws out Ai’s character over the course of the film. While the documentary centers primarily on his political work, the filmmakers also grant viewers insightful glimpses into the man behind the work, including a particularly poignant response to an interview question, a touching conversation with his mother, and a flash of defiance when he recounts his latest brush with the police. The result is a rich and compelling portrait of Ai: a humble yet stoic 55-year-old man, deeply burdened by his activism but duty-bound to continue it.
The disappointingly few artistic pieces featured in the film are powerful and fascinating: His 1997 work “Coca-Cola vase,” for example, features a Neolithic vase (over 3,000 years old) with a simple Coca-Cola logo painted across the front. Though certainly an act of defiance against the current Chinese establishment, this piece has important artistic merit, even when removed from the political context.
By defaming something so ancient and culturally sacred, Ai has raised a highly provocative and artistically valid question: Are some objects so sacred as to be untouchable? Or are all objects simply objects? Amid the more dominant political elements of the film, messages like these — which are also important to understanding Ai’s life and work — are often lost.
Although the film does not fully explore all aspects of Ai’s life and work, Never Sorry strikes a good balance between condemning the Chinese government and praising one of its dissidents. The film is far from pure propaganda, and yet throughout the documentary we are constantly reminded of the grave context surrounding Ai’s work. Amid this commentary, the filmmakers are also able to flesh out Ai’s fascinating and oftentimes elusive character. In this way, Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry is in equal parts a compelling portrait of a daring artist and a criticism of the oppressive circumstances that surround him.
Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry will be playing at the Harris Theater (809 Liberty Ave.) through Sept. 13.

Dear Patrick,
I am an attractive female first-year, and all these older guys keep hitting on me. It’s really distracting! So what if I dress in revealing clothes and only go to parties where I can get in for free and then talk about myself the whole time? Why can’t these guys just give me my free drink and then leave me alone?
Thanks,
Earnest Seniors Purchase Every Cup I Acquire, Liquor, Libation, Yet Make Every Opportune Conversation Seductive
Dear ESPECIALLY THE OCS,
That’s a really tough problem. It must be so difficult to be a hot, young first-year. I’m really interested in what you have to say. Please go on. This is so fascinating to me. I am maintaining appropriate amounts of eye contact and nodding at what you say in agreement. While we’re talking, I’m throwing a party this weekend. You should totally swing by so we can hang out. And don’t worry, you won’t have to pay.
Oh wait, it’s past the first month of school? Never mind. For the first couple months of school, all the new students have that “first-year spark.” After their first grades start rolling in, that spark dies, and the first-years become just as unattractive as the rest of us. 
I am serious about that party, though. Swing by,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
For reasons I can’t get into here, I need to flee the country immediately. I have 10 items, each of which weighs a different amount and has different value to me, but I can only take some of them with me. How can I decide what to pack so I can stay ahead of the authorities?
Please hurry,
Immediately Need Notice On Collecting Everything Necessary Tonight
Dear INNOCENT,
Unfortunately for you, you’ve stumbled upon the knapsack problem, a classic problem in combinatorics. The issue is that the problem is NP-hard. As a computer science major, I am required to avoid all such problems. If it can’t be solved in polynomial time, I can’t do it.
Admittedly, actually doing the math to pack your bag wouldn’t take long, but what am I, a mathematician? We computer scientists don’t compromise when it comes to nondeterministic polynomial time! What we should really be focusing on is why you’re fleeing the country in the first place. I’d suggest a sincere apology to get you out of trouble. If in the meantime you happen to discover a polynomial-time algorithm for solving the knapsack problem, go on and forward that to me. 
Or just buy a bigger knapsack,
Patrick Hoskins

100 years ago: Oct. 3, 1912
The Tartan advertises a need for new female writers to report on happenings at Margaret Morrison College. The ad urges women to be proactive and offer up a piece for publishing instead of complaining about how very little is published about the school.

Scaife Hall opens for the fall semester. An aluminum screen surrounding the building is supposed to keep out the sun until 4:30 p.m. every afternoon, due in part to the ceramic tile covering the inside of the building. The science is poorly explained, but it’s nice to know that someone tried to justify that awful bath tile in the stairwells.
25 years ago: Sept. 9, 1987
A column addressing the lacking love lives of students researches male and female interactions on campus. The article calls out women for heading to clusters wearing pajamas, slippers, and athletic gear. The students of 1987 would shudder to see what happens now in Gates 3000.

A second bomb threat of the semester threatens Whitfield Hall, an off-campus administrative building located in Oakland. The threat was sent via email but was not discovered and acknowledged until three days later. Luckily the threat turned out to be fake, but the delayed response seems like a bit of a security issue.

Pokémon: The First Movie
10 12
Mew faces off against Mewtwo in this bizarre, episodic adaptation of the franchise we all spent our childhood allowances on. Released stateside in 1999, at the height of a prepubescent frenzy rivaled only by POGs and Cabbage Patch Kids, Pokémon: The First Movie grossed over $160 million. Enthusiasts should prepare for a stroke of nostalgia as Ash, Pikachu, Misty, Brock, and Team Rocket preach a sermon of anti-violence didactic enough to roll the eyes of children everywhere.
Brave
8 10 12
Merida is not your standard Disney Princess. As Pixar’s most recent effort, Brave draws a portrait of a strong, roguish young woman who decides to stand up for her right to think for herself. If lacking in the type of groundbreaking narrative flourish that we’ve come to expect from the studio, Brave is still a delicious feast of visual delight. The Scottish Highlands are rendered in astonishing detail and with plenty of cinematic panache.
Steamboy
7:30 10 12:30
After 10 years in production, almost 200,000 individual drawings, and one of the biggest budgets in Japanese animation history, Steamboy triumphantly arrived in 2004. Since then, it has gathered a strong following and high status among steampunk enthusiasts. Director Katsuhiro Otomo, of Akira fame, produces a second film with spectacular sci-fi sweep and bold imagination. The story is historical, challenging, and occasionally obtuse, but Patrick Stewart and Anna Paquin serve as excellent guides in two memorable vocal performances.
Rango
6 8 10
Not only was Rango far-and-away the best animated work of 2011, it was one of the best films of the year — proving that we’re living in a new golden age of animation where Pixar isn’t the only studio capable of expanding the visual and narrative template. It proudly sports a package of vocal performances that rank as the finest in recent memory. Johnny Depp plays Rango, an accidental sheriff who reinvents himself and changes a town forever. Rango ambitiously sets out to do no less than repackage and market the Western to a new generation, both subverting and paying homage to the recognizable genre conventions.

Students living in Margaret Morrison, Roselawn, and Woodlawn Apartments — the housing area known as the Intersection — are upset over an upheaval in their laundry service.
Intersection residents, who have until now done their laundry in the facilities on the first floor of the Margaret Morrison Plaza, were moved to a room in the basement of Hamerschlag House on Aug. 31 to make way for a new dining location. Hamerschlag residents’ laundry facilities have been moved to a former storage room in the main Hamerschlag building. Intersection residents’ key cards have been adjusted to allow them access to the Hamerschlag basement.
According to Director of Housing and Dining Services Director Kim Abel, the new dining location is one component of a larger plan to renovate and update Carnegie Mellon dining, which also includes a patio addition to Resnik and a new façade for Margaret Morrison. Abel said that Housing and Dining Services hopes to create a more communal space in Margaret Morrison, and that the laundry room made the most sense to remove.
“The laundry was a service that we believed that we could relocate and continue to provide similar, proximal service,” Abel said. She believes that the new laundry accommodations are very similar to the old ones.
But many residents see the move as a sudden, unrequested, and unpleasant change. Among their concerns, they note that the Hamerschlag facility is farther away; that it contains fewer washing machines and dryers, not all of which currently work; that it is poorly lit and not well temperature-controlled; and  that Hamerschlag residents can access it through an emergency exit, which could be a safety concern. Above all, residents feel they were not properly consulted or warned about the change.
On Aug. 31, residents received an email from Housing and Dining Facilities Director Louis McCauley that informed them that their laundry room was closed, and that they were now to do their laundry in a room in the basement of Hamerschlag. For some, such as junior creative writing and professional writing double major Rachel Bullen of Roselawn, it was the first official confirmation they had heard about the change. Other residents heard about the change at R.A. meetings during the first week of school.
After Bullen and her housemate, junior directing major Andrea Beschel, circulated a petition to stop the move, McCauley attended a previously scheduled Margaret Morrison safety meeting to hear questions and concerns. 
Bullen and Beschel said they believe the meeting was in response to a large number of individual emails to McCauley and Abel from Intersection residents protesting the change.
According to Bullen, McCauley said during the meeting that the maker of the laundry machines, Caldwell & Gregory, had “done the math,” and determined that one washing machine and dryer are necessary for every 38 people.
“The meeting at Margaret Morrison was pretty much, ‘We’re sorry we didn’t tell you, but this makes sense,’ ” Bullen said.
McCauley arranged for a meeting of himself, Abel, and a group of representatives from the Intersection this week to discuss options. Abel said that Housing and Dining is not committed to a plan, or to stopping the move, at this time.
“There are lots of options that we can look at,” Abel said. “I want to make sure that I hear the students’ feedback.”
Abel stressed that Housing and Dining is receptive to, and in fact actively seeks, student input.
“We have always utilized student input in almost everything we do in Housing and Dining,” Abel said. “Some of it’s informal. Some of it’s through advisory groups. Some of it’s through our partnership with Student Senate.”
Abel mentioned that the Student Dormitory Council (SDC) and the Dining Advisory Committee are the two major student advisory groups that Housing and Dining consults.
But Beschel, who was also a resident of Roselawn last year, said that she doesn’t feel that the affected students were even warned of the changes, let alone consulted.
“A dining service is something that the community that’s being affected doesn’t need,” Beschel said. “We’re not freshmen, we’re mostly not on a meal plan, we have our own kitchens.” Beschel and Bullen both said that, although some people do support the new dining location, most Intersection residents they’ve spoken to are opposed to the change. Their petition currently has 84 signatures out of about 140 Intersection residents.
According to Beschel and Bullen, an email was sent out to students last year advertising an open forum to discuss housing and dining changes, but the email only specifically mentioned the Resnik patio, not the possibility of a change in Intersection facilities.
Abel said that although Housing and Dining has been discussing the new dining location since last winter, it was unlikely that students were told about the upcoming change during room selection. “I don’t know, because the service is remaining the same, that that is something we would communicate,” she said.
“I’m really annoyed they didn’t talk to us,” Bullen said. “I just want to know where we go from here. I don’t think we should stick to the original plan.”
Beschel said that she feels that the lack of communication is unacceptable.
“We really do want to have a neighborhood here where our opinions are respected,” Beschel said. “We’re not here and gone, we’re here for four years, and we pay for that, and we deserve to be heard.”
Despite the protests, Abel said that she is excited about the new plan for Housing and Dining. “We’re doing some really neat things with the renovations and the plans. I’m hoping that we can move beyond this issue in a constructive way and get to the constructive part.”
The petition to stop the move can be found at https://www.change.org/petitions/stop-the-laundry-move. The primary contact of the SDC, which represents students’ housing concerns on campus, is the SDC president, junior information systems major Nathan Hahn. The SDC meets every Wednesday at 8 p.m. in Breed Hall. Meetings are open to Carnegie Mellon residents.

Several companies are rolling out a new strategy for marketing on campus this semester: student ambassadors. Sony, Google, Microsoft, Red Bull, and possibly others all have student representatives on campus. These students are usually paid employees of the corporations and receive training, goods for demonstration or distribution, and support from other trained representatives in networks spread across campuses nationwide.
Some student ambassadors are tasked with organizing and executing promotional events as well as acting as the heads of the local social media scene. These representatives can act as the spearhead for marketing strategies and events.
Maddie Horowitz, a sophomore computer science major, is a “Microsoft Student Partner.” Her first task was to set up a Facebook group for people interested in Microsoft products on campus.
“Carnegie Mellon students are pretty interested in this sort of thing,” Horowitz said, noting that in a competition among a hundred Microsoft Student Partners to get the most likes for their campus Facebook pages, the one she started had an early lead compared to those at larger schools.
“The most common reaction people have when they hear I’m a partner is, ‘Oh, does that mean you’re interning for them this summer?’ ” Horowitz said of the attitude toward ambassadors. “I think it’s a really good idea to hear this sort of info from a friend or other student instead of just a random person.”
Horowitz is involved in continual training with Microsoft products, and will soon be joined by another Student Partner on campus.
The representatives of Google on campus are junior electrical and chemical engineering major Beth Anne Katz and senior computer science major Brenda Lee. As Google Ambassadors, they have similar tasks to Horowitz with competing products. Together, they both expressed enthusiasm for the Google corporate structure and some of the upcoming products they have been briefed on, including a service that collects photos from events taken by different people.
Lee said that the most common reaction to her position was “Get me a job!” Having interned at Google, both Lee and Katz were quick to sign up for the Ambassador position, but stressed that it was a position any interested student should pursue.
However, not everyone is particularly enamored with these programs.
Recently, nontraditional marketing strategies — especially those that use people as the means of distribution — have aroused controversy. One of the most prominent in recent years was the “Homeless Hotspots,” Wi-Fi connections provided by residents of a homeless shelter who received $20 a day and were told to distribute passwords to wireless transceivers they wore in exchange for tips.
This initiative, run by BBH Labs during the South By Southwest festival in Austin, Tx. this past March, was denounced by many bloggers and members of traditional media, although the homeless individuals and a director of the shelter told The New York Times they weren’t bothered and had a hard time understanding the outcry.
This form of advertisement is one with some unique challenges other than public perception. Google recently fired an employee who was promoting the new Chromebook in Best Buy after he posted pictures of his uniform, badge, and certificate of completed training on Reddit, along with some information about the product he would be working to sell, as documented by The Daily Dot. His actions were a breach of a nondisclosure agreement that was still in effect regarding his training and work. Google did not make an announcement regarding the sale of Chromebooks in Best Buy.
Both Horowitz for Microsoft and Lee and Katz for Google said that their superiors were reached mainly through online means: either conference calls to corporate headquarters (frequently at odd hours due to time zone differences) or emails. The organizational structures employed in the work do mean a lack of day-to-day oversight and high levels of implicit trust in the student representatives, and while Lee and Katz said they may be called upon to provide Google with information from time to time, gauging the efficacy of the program as a whole could prove challenging.
Student opinions on the advertising strategy are split. Some, like sophomore mechanical engineering major Faith Quist, are put off. “Honestly, I think it’s kind of sleazy,” Quist said. “I don’t think it would bother me all that much but I wouldn’t do it myself.” 
Quist said, recalling her summer job selling homework aids to students, “I wouldn’t want to do anything like that again.”
Other students, however, took a somewhat more positive view. “These are just students doing a job,” Peter Masters, a sophomore international relations and environmental policy major, said in reaction to such promotional maneuvers, noting that student representatives are not nearly as controversial. “I know some people were bothered by the Red Bull girls at the activities fair... [but]I don’t think it does any foul; it’s just a form of advertisement.”

This year, Carnegie Mellon’s Dining Services added five new venues and adjusted two existing venues. Creperie, Stackers, Nakama Express, Worlds of Flavor, and El Gallo de Oro are all new eateries. 
Evgefstos’ hours were also adjusted so that students could eat there between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m., and Dining Services expanded the Schatz breakfast menu to include sandwiches.
Creperie is located in the UC Marketplace, between the existing Downtown Deli and Spinning Salads. At Creperie, students can select what ingredients and toppings go onto their crepe and then watch a chef make it. 
Both Stackers, a sandwich venue, and Nakama Express, a sushi venue, are located in the Resnik food court. Worlds of Flavor is in the Tartan Pavilion and El Gallo de Oro is on the first floor of the University Center, in the former location of Sí Señor.
“I think it’s good that there’s more variety and that they’re trying to keep things interesting every year,” said Erik Pintar, a sophomore electrical and computer engineering major.
According to Kim Abel, the Director of Housing and Dining Services, the decision to add these new eateries, and make some adjustments to existing ones, was made over the years and is a continuous process. She said there was no exact point in time when they came to the decision to specifically add the Creperie, Stackers, Worlds of Flavor, or Nakama Express.
“We are continuously trying to improve our venue options,” Abel said.
“They’re probably going with the trends,” Lina Pulgarin, first-year physics major, said of Creperie being added. “It’s kinda like going through a cupcake trend, cake trend, etc. Now they’re going through a crepe trend.”
According to Abel, Dining Services added these new options because of student feedback and trends. Venues like Creperie are a trend at other universities, and Dining Services felt it would be a good addition to the campus.
Of Creperie, Pintar said, “I think the food is delicious but the portions are small.”
Other dining changes were made for different reasons. Abel said that Sí Señor was switched out for El Gallo de Oro in response to student feedback concerning Si Señor and students’ appreciation of Mexican food. Worlds of Flavor, on the other hand, was added because of the positive response students gave to last year’s Take Comfort promotion on Tuesday nights.
“Stackers was actually something that one of the chefs came up with,” Abel said. “Students really get to choose what they want to eat. They can pick each ingredient.”
Nakama Express is the new sushi eatery in Resnik, located where Sushi Too used to exist.
“[Nakama Express] was good. They made me what I wanted. It was custom sushi,” Katy Wells, fifth-year senior global studies major, said of the new sushi venue.

Provost to participate in live webcast of WEF panel
Carnegie Mellon Provost Mark Kamlet will take part in a panel at the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Wednesday.
Though most WEF panels are closed to the public and press, this panel, “The Future of Education,” will be webcast live at 5:15 a.m. EST. Former U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown will also be on the panel, which will discuss the mobilization of information technology, interdisciplinary approaches, and the value of universities.
This is the second time Carnegie Mellon has been represented at the summer meeting of the WEF (known as “Summer Davos” in recognition of the fact that the winter WEF meeting traditionally occurs in Davos, Switzerland). 
In 2011, Carnegie Mellon faculty presented at both the summer and winter WEF meetings. This week, five WEF panels, including “The Future of Education,” will contain presentations by Carnegie Mellon faculty or administrators. 
Among the panelists and presenters at the meeting are art professor Golan Levin; computer science professors Jeanette Wing amd Emma Brunskill; and Jesse Schell, an entertainment technology professor.
The theme of this week’s “Summer Davos” meeting, running this Tuesday through Thursday, is “Creating the Future Economy.”
HCII officially appoints new Geschke director Cassell
Last Thursday, it was announced that Justine Cassell will be officially appointed as the Charles M. Geschke Director of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII).
The ceremony is set to take place on campus on Monday from 4 to 6 p.m. in the Asian Students Association Conference Room (Gates Center 6115).
Cassell has served as HCII director since 2010, but the post as director has now been officially endowed by Adobe Systems, Inc. co-founder and Carnegie Mellon Ph.D. recipient Charles M. Geschke and his wife.
Cassell’s research looks into computer systems that utilize conversation and storytelling to enhance human communication skills and learning. In addition, Cassell has developed the Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA), which is capable of communicating with humans using both verbal and nonverbal interaction. The ECA has been researched as a virtual peer for children, and autistic children in particular.
Last January, Cassell spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos, and was awarded the Anita Borg Institute’s Women of Vision Award. She also chairs one of the World Economic Forum Global Agenda Councils.

Students will no longer have to battle over the coveted free-parking spots on Margaret Morrison Street; at the start of the semester, meters were erected on the street, ready to eat up students’ quarters. At any other university, this might not be a big deal. But here, where parking is not only scarce but also expensive, taking away a conveniently located street of free parking is another strain on students.
With this street gone, students who live on campus and want to have a car are left with limited options. There’s parking on campus, which is convenient but also incredibly expensive. The East Campus Garage, for example, will cost $114.50 per month — or $1,145 for the 10 months classes are in session. And the garage isn’t even the most expensive parking lot on campus.
“We continue to make every effort to keep parking rates reasonable, especially during these economic times,” Michelle Porter, the director of Parking & Transportation Services, said in an announcement last year. And yet, the rates for the 2012–13 academic year increased about 3 percent, and they will in all likelihood continue to increase year after year.
Space is also a major issue, since parking areas are limited on campus. “Demand for parking is expected to be very high, and we anticipate that our lots will be at capacity during the 2012–2013 parking year; therefore, we suggest that you select multiple preferences,” Porter further said in the announcement. This year, for Doherty Apartment’s parking, there was so much demand that there was a waitlist for spots.
Moreover, students can only apply for a permit spot during a certain period, between April 23 and May 4. As a result, they have to know far in advance if they will be bringing a car to campus, further complicating the process for students.
Compare this to an annual City of Pittsburgh parking permit, which costs about $20. With a city permit, residents are allowed to park on multiple streets in the area surrounding their address rather than having to choose a parking spot on availability.
However, students living on campus can’t apply for a City of Pittsburgh permit since they have a campus address.
This leaves them to decide between forgoing a car and depending on the PAT bus system or dealing with the stress and costs of having a car on campus.
The addition of meters to Margaret Morrison Street may seem like a minor inconvenience to some, but to many students who already face expensive and limited parking options, it is a severe blow.

Friday’s job numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics are just another one of the many painful reminders of the recent economic collapse and ensuing recession.
In the month of August, three times as many workers left the job market as found jobs. There was no wage growth and the vast majority of jobs gained were low-paying, and most were jobs serving alcoholic drinks, indicating a trend towards escapism. This is the fourth month in a row of dismal jobs numbers that on the surface seem hopeful (the unemployment rate fell from 8.3 percent to 8.1 percent), but are discouraging when you look into them.
This begs the question: Why is the economy still so bad?
Our president is very fond of saying that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and the Republicans want to “take us back to the policies that got us in the mess in the first place.” What typically follows is empty rhetoric about letting Wall Street write its own rules and cutting taxes for the 1 percent. That all sounds great, but that’s actually not what got us here.
Everyone has heard the narrative before. A bunch of people bought houses and got mortgages. The banks then gambled with these mortgages, packaged them up, and invested on them in a very risky way. When some people defaulted on these mortgages, the whole thing went south, some banks failed, more people defaulted on their mortgages due to the economy, companies laid employees off, the ailing auto industry was hit by a lack of demand, and the whole economy cascaded into stagnation.
The second half of the previous paragraph is pretty much true. Once the initial shocks hit, everything imploded and a lot of weak sectors and companies were shaken up. But I don’t buy the supposed root cause: greedy Wall Street investment bankers took risky investments on the backs of hardworking Americans.
I’m not really a fan of Wall Street so I’m not about to defend it, but the housing market has been the surest bet in the American economy since the ’50s. Home values have always consistently increased, according to U.S. Census data, and people typically try to pay their mortgages because they need a place to live. Realistically, these investments weren’t as risky as they’re made out to be.
The real cause of the recession lies in people living beyond their means.
Government programs such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac made it easy for low-income people to get low interest loans, whether they were qualified for them or not. They were all about helping people become homeowners. There’s no deeper-rooted American value than property ownership, and these programs reflected the great intention to give everyone a shot at owning a home.
They did this by creating a secondary mortgage market for mortgage-backed securities which would then increase the attractiveness of mortgages for banks to incentivize lending to low-income or even no-income people.
Realistically, however, some people just weren’t good candidates to take on the debt and responsibility that comes with owning a home and financing a mortgage. They shot too far when they weren’t ready and came up short. They defaulted on their mortgages en masse and started the vicious cycle that got us where we are today.
Romney and the Republicans want to rectify the problem of living beyond our means. Entitlement reform is crucial to this goal. If we stay on this course of borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend, according to North Dakota Democratic Senator Kent Conrad, we will eventually default on our debt.
We need to practice budget austerity, otherwise the entire U.S. economy will follow the trajectory of the housing market with consequences to scale.

As a member of the Intersection collection of dormitories on campus, I am writing to air grievances regarding recent changes made to the housing situation there by Housing and Dining. In previous years, the Intersection was served by a collection of laundry machines located in Margaret Morrison Plaza. Upon arrival to Carnegie Mellon this semester, students of the Intersection discovered their laundry room had been abruptly closed and they had been permanently redirected to a laundry room in the basement of Hamerschlag.
Concerns about this change have not been answered by Housing and Dining with more than perfunctory brush-offs, so I am seeking a wider audience. Our complaints fall into two major categories. The first is purely logistical; the new laundry location is farther, with fewer washers that are in worse condition, meaning that the Intersection’s access to laundry has been more than halved. Rubbing salt into the wound is the fact that multiple machines in the Hamerschlag laundry room simply do not function at all. This situation is highly frustrating, especially since it is a permanent change that residents of the Intersection have no recourse from.
In addition, students were not informed of this decision until after the school year began, despite it being planned as far back as before housing selection for the 2012–13 school year. Students in the Intersection were given no opportunity to respond to this change, and signed their housing agreement with one understanding only to find their housing situation was substantially different when they arrived. It is inappropriate and unreasonable for such a decision to be foisted on students so abruptly and underhandedly.
The students of the Intersection do not accept this situation. We are upset that our access to laundry machines has been abruptly reduced and disconcerted that we were entirely cut out of the decision-making process, and above all, we want Housing and Dining to acknowledge we have a legitimate grievance and to take steps to address it.

We hope you’ve been having a good first few weeks back on campus!
We wanted to use this letter to update you on the progress of some of our initiatives thus far into the semester and give you a road map of what Student Government Exec has planned for the upcoming year.
We have been working hard to start off the year with a strong PR presence for student government — PR has been and continues to be one of our primary objectives for the year, and we began working during Orientation week by registering voters at meal times.
We were able to both register a significant amount of first-years and connect with our new constituents. Over the summer we brought together the Board of Directors to create the programming for the “Welcome Back Weekend” and offer a chance for the entire campus to come together at the start of the year. We are now focused on hitting the ground running on many of our initiatives outlined in our platform.
We plan on expanding our voter registration efforts throughout the semester, and as we near Election Day, we will be providing resources for absentee voting, profiles on local candidates, and ideally hosting debate and election result watch parties.
We generated a lot of buzz in our campaign about our first town hall meeting — we are still hammering down a date, but it will be the week of Sept. 17, and we will be giving out Chipotle to attendees. This town hall will be used to collect feedback on a number of issues, including possible changes to the student activities fee.
We are in the process of scheduling meetings with various administrators of campus services to see what they are looking for from student government, as well as advocating on various issues such as Shuttle and Escort based on feedback from the last issue of The Tartan.
To make it easier to track our progress, we are very close to launching our official blog on cmu.edu/stugov, where we will push weekly updates on our various initiatives.
We also want to acknowledge that there are some initiatives that we are not as far along with as we would have hoped. For instance, we were unable to get the group event attendance competition up and running for the start of the semester, but we will continue to work on this and hope to get the logistics worked out soon.
Our main goal is to maintain open communication with the Carnegie Mellon community so you can know how we are working to help you. We are open to criticism and collaboration throughout the semester, and you can always email us at sbp@andrew.cmu.edu. Additionally, you can attend our office hours, which are posted at cmu.edu/stugov. If you see us around, stop and say hi and let us know how we can best serve you.

Student Body President and Vice President

People don’t read license agreements — otherwise known as those “Terms and Conditions” boxes — when they buy things online. Why? Because they are extremely long and mundane, and the consumer usually makes assumptions about the license that are generally correct. When it comes to purchasing digital music, most consumers assume that whatever they buy, whether they receive it in a tangible form or keep it as a digital resource, is theirs to own. Therefore, the vast majority of online shoppers find it unnecessary to scale the dense walls of text in online license agreements.
However, digital ownership is not always the result of an online purchase, especially when it comes to music. This was showcased last week, when rumors spread that actor Bruce Willis planned to sue Apple after finding out he was unable to legally pass down his iTunes collection to his daughters — because, technically, he does not own his iTunes collection. Songs bought from iTunes are personally licensed to the buyer, but they are not “owned.”
To clear up some of this confusion — and avoid expensive legal battles — online agencies should make very clear what one can or cannot do with an online product by reforming how license agreements are conveyed to users.
Digital licensing is an extremely unclear matter, especially for consumers; it takes real effort for someone to find out what they can or cannot do with something bought online. 
Although it’s true that the buyer could perform extensive research into the restrictions on his or her purchase, it would be much more effective for online agencies to make those “Terms and Conditions” boxes a little easier on the eyes through better visual design and layout of the license agreements.
As they exist right now, online license agreements are irritating obstructions that consumers skip over in a matter of seconds. In order to make sure buyers know what they can or cannot do with their purchases, companies need to ensure that their license agreements are readable, clear, and concise. They need to be designed, not only by lawyers invested in protecting the company, but by writers who can communicate such ideas clearly to the general public.

At the end of these past two weeks, it is quite likely that those of us following the conventions closely — even in sound bites — might feel somewhat fatigued. From Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney to his wife Ann to First Lady Michelle Obama, and everybody in between, it’s been speeches back to back.
Yet last Wednesday at the Democratic National Convention, before the commander in chief got his say, one of his predecessors took the stage for what was the best case for Barack Obama I’ve heard the Democrats deliver.
Former president Bill Clinton came out as what appeared to be the Democrats’ unlikely trump card, because despite his rhetorical and political prowess, he is now more well known for his admittedly ill-advised cigar shenanigans than for what he actually accomplished while in office.
However, his speech was everything the Republican National Convention speeches weren’t in that it actually laid out plans, accomplishments, and details.
It spent more time presenting what one side got right than what the other got wrong; that is why I believe it did more for the president than practically any other effort in the past four years. In spite of his somewhat sordid reputation, Clinton laid out a strong foundational case for the Democrats by reminding us all of a little thing he calls “arithmetic” — sheer numerical facts.
His bottom line? In the past 51 years, Democrats created 42 million jobs while in office and Republicans created just 24 million, less than half that amount, a statement that fact-checking website PolitiFact.com verified as true.
Such numbers, while the crux of Clinton’s argument, weren’t the only things he stressed. He made sure to give credit were credit is due, even to former president George W. Bush for his support of PEPFAR, the government’s AIDS relief program, a mention conspicuously absent from this year’s RNC. But Clinton also reminded us of all the qualities that make Obama the preferable choice.
He stressed Obama’s attempts at cooperation within and without the party, from cabinet appointments, such as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to the new jobs plan that was rejected by Congress. Clinton also included the actions taken by Obama early in his presidency, such as the then-unpopular (but now seemingly vindicated) stimulus plan and automobile bailout.
Clinton played up what is arguably Obama’s biggest accomplishment in healthcare reform, and noted the other side’s plans to get rid of it.
And in his final remarks, Clinton struck a chord with the audience, summarizing why those concerned with changing voter policies, immigration, or the middle class should re-elect Obama. Clinton’s line of the night might have been: “We cannot afford to double-down on trickle-down.”
Thus, he was able to convince me that whether you go just by the numbers or are simply looking for a moderate willing to reach across the aisle, Obama is who you should vote for come November.

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s “Latch On NYC” movement has put baby formula behind lock and key. About two-thirds of New York’s hospitals are participating in the movement, which restricts new mothers’ access to formula. Although it won’t be denied to women with newborns, they will now have to specifically ask for formula and go through a lecture on the health benefits of breast milk each time they need it.
It’s true that breast milk is better for newborns than baby formula. WomensHealth.gov, a site by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, cites how babies raised on breast milk are less susceptible to asthma, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes than those raised on formula. But these new restrictions Bloomberg has put on new mothers’ access to formula don’t take reality into account.
The reality of the situation is that not all women have the time or energy to breastfeed or the money to buy expensive equipment for breastfeeding. Breast pumps can cost up to $400, equipment that isn’t always covered by health insurance.
What’s more, a campaign of this type has the potential to create a social stigma around baby formula. Messages that support breastfeeding as the only way to nourish your newborn can easily be translated into “If you’re a good mother, you’ll breastfeed,” or “only mothers who can’t properly care for their child use formula.” These messages are reinforced by the fact that a mother has to sign for a bottle of formula, like she’s buying a controlled and prescribed drug.
Instead of restricting formula, Bloomberg should make it easier for women to breastfeed; working on changing the public’s perception of the practice. Why not make restaurants and workplaces more breastfeeding friendly? Or subsidize breast pumps and other lactation devices? Measures to encourage breastfeeding are more ethical and considerate of new mothers than limiting their options.
Restrictions like those instituted by “Latch On NYC” fail to take the pressures of reality and circumstance into consideration. There are better ways to encourage breastfeeding than making the process of getting formula that much harder for new mothers.

Kids in mascara, pregnant teenagers, obesity, extra thumbs, and way too much roadkill — it has finally happened. A monstrous chunk of America’s ridiculous societal upsets have made it to the limelight in TLC’s reality comedy show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.
This spin-off from reality show Toddlers and Tiaras stars the hillbilly pageant queen Alana Thompson, her mom June “the coupon queen,” Glitzy the pet pig, and the rest of their uncensored, unconventional family.
The show follows Alana’s beauty-pageant struggles and various subplots involving her sisters — nicknamed Chickadee, Chubbs, and Pumpkin — and her father Mike, a.k.a. Sugar Bear.
The show is wildly compelling; it’s crude, honest, and most importantly, hysterical. It’s like every other tabloid-endorsed reality show, except it’s missing the trust funds, the Jersey nightclubs, and the seven strangers picked to live in one house. The similarities, however, lie in the array of overstrung off-screen scandals that, in recent weeks, have circled Honey Boo Boo and her clan.
The most infamous controversy surrounds photos that feature Pumpkin, Alana’s twelve-year-old sister, feeding Kaitlyn, Chickadee’s newborn daughter, Mountain Dew-dipped pacifiers.
Soda is unhealthy at any age, and it is widely agreed that giving it to a one-month-old is going too far. Feeding infants soda may result in obesity, diabetes, cavities, and other nutritional deficiencies. This was probably not Pumpkin’s best move, but in her defense, maybe it was the best they could do. It’s not healthy, but it’s their normal. Coming from a family that feasts on roadkill, I don’t find it so weird.
This, however, has itched the feet of mothers and nutritionists alike. But I haven’t even gotten to the best — and juiciest — part of this story.
Kaitlyn has an extra thumb. And the most “scandalous” part of Kaitlyn’s extra limb? Mama June has been accused of making fun of it. Imagine the claimed awfulness of this: A thirty-two year old grandmother having the nerve to tease her infant granddaughter for her birth defect.
Critics argue that while it was unfortunate enough for Kaitlyn to suffer from this defect, she should at least have support from her family. In an interview with People, June retracted her negative approach, claiming, “We have embraced [the abnormality]. It makes Kaitlyn more special to us.”
The show may be backward, but the criticism is even more so. Even though it is entertainment, the show is still real. These people are real.
They live this lifestyle that people condemn, criticize and try to fix, but it’s still their lives. These controversies are bizarre, but that does not make them scandals.
The Mountain Dew and extra thumb issues aren’t even the half of it.
Critics are in uproar over the fact that each of June’s children have different fathers. They are furious that ratings exceeded those of the Republican National Convention for some demographics. They swarmed over a wardrobe malfunction.
The criticism is coming from every direction, and at the root of it is the lack of approval over the family’s lifestyle.
It’s just their way of living, and that does not stop me or the other three million viewers from reveling in it. Honey Boo Boo has come, and she is certainly not wavering out of the spotlight. The real question is this: Will their lifestyle stop you from watching?
