Serena Williams is no stranger to controversy at the U.S. Open. In her 2009 semi-finals match against Kim Clijsters, Williams was called for a foot fault on her second serve, gifting Clijsters double match point. Rattled and under pressure, she launched an expletive-filled threat at the lineswoman. Having already received a conduct warning for throwing her racket earlier in the match, her tirade resulted to a one-point penalty, handing victory to Clijsters.
Two years later, Williams was facing break point against Sam Stosur in the finals, when she ripped what appeared to be a forehand winner. “Come on!” she shouted in excitement. But when Stosur managed to tip the ball off her racket’s frame, Williams’ exclamation led the chair umpire to enact the hindrance rule, which states that if a player deliberately hinders the opponent’s ability to play the point, the opponent wins the point. Stosur was awarded the point and thus the game, prompting a verbal onslaught from Williams towards the chair umpire.
This year, on Sept. 8, Williams and U.S. Open officials clashed for a third time during her finals match against Naomi Osaka. After losing the first set 6-2, Williams was up 1-0 in the second set when chair umpire Carlos Ramos issued her a warning for receiving coaching. Williams insisted to Ramos that she had not been cheating, and play continued. After being broken to make the score 3-2, she smashed her racket in frustration, bringing on her second violation and causing Osaka to start the next game 15-0.
Williams called Ramos a thief and demanded an apology. “You stole a point from me,” she declared. After losing two more games — Osaka now leading 4-3 — Williams turned her attention back to Ramos. “You are a liar. You will never be on a court of mine as long as you live. When are you going to give me my apology? Say you are sorry,” she insisted, leading him to issue another code violation for abuse. A third violation meant Osaka was given an entire game, pushing her lead to 5-3. She won the following game, winning the match and her first Grand Slam title.
During her argument with Ramos and other referees, Williams mentioned that she had heard men say a lot worse and not be penalized, causing an uproar concerning sexism in tennis officiating. Legend Billie Jean King tweeted, “When a woman is emotional, she’s ‘hysterical’ and she’s penalized for it.” King continued: “When a man does the same, he’s ‘outspoken’ & and there are no repercussions.” Several male players voiced their support, acknowledging that they have instead received “soft warnings” for verbal attacks — being told that they are pushing the limits and any more arguing will incur a penalty.
Ramos is known for being a strict but fair umpire, who adheres closely to the rules and treats players equally regardless of their ranking. However, Ramos certainly could have taken the “soft warning” approach — something he did utilize when Novak Djokovic complained about a unsportsmanlike conduct warning earlier this year at Wimbledon. Williams, however, also clearly lost her cool and pushed the issue over the course of multiple games, allowing the infractions to get to her head and effect her concentration on the court.
Unfortunately, the Williams-Ramos confrontation overshadowed Osaka’s brilliant play. The 20-year-old dominated the first set and played exceptionally well in the second set, even without the game penalty factored in. She had been gaining momentum, winning two straight games and taking a 4-3 lead. Osaka, whose mother is Japanese, has lived in the United States since she was three, but competes for the Japanese Tennis Association. With her triumph at the U.S. Open, Osaka became the first Japanese player to ever win a Grand Slam title.
Drowned out by the drama of the women’s finals was the significance of Djokovic’s 6-3, 7-6, 6-3 victory over Juan Martin del Potro in the men’s finals match the following night. Djokovic is now tied with Pete Sampras for third on the career Grand Slam wins list, with 14. He is only three behind Rafael Nadal and six back from Roger Federer. With his success this summer at Wimbledon and now the U.S. Open, the conversation has now turned to his legacy and his place among the greats. Djokovic is now potentially on track to surpass Federer as the greatest player of all time. Declaring Federer as the GOAT is an easy case to make, but he is nearing the end of his career. Nadal, on the other hand, needs to win several non-clay Slams to make the claim that he was better than Federer. Additionally, Nadal is more injury-prone than Djokovic, especially during the hard court season when his knees take a beating.
But if Djokovic keeps up his recent form, it is not hard to see him adding several slams to his trophy collection over the next few years. He has shown that he is a tenacious fighter: a 22-point duel with del Potro while down 4-3 in the second set put his grit to the test, and he won the game, keeping the set on-serve. Even if he cannot surpass Federer in total Slam wins, other factors — at the moment, Djokovic leads Federer in head-to-head competition — suggest he is right up there with the Swiss legend. His career’s two most dominant stretches are on par with Federer’s best stints and came against top caliber players like Federer, Nadal and Andy Murray, while many of Federer’s Slams wins came against competitors outside the “Big Four.” Federer is still at it, and has the chance to tack on one or two more Slams before his time comes to a close but Djokovic’s ability to return to his former level of play will make this a truly compelling race.

Soccer fans in the Northern Hemisphere know it’s fall every year when the Champions League Group Stage rolls back around, and after a few months off, the tournament is all set to kick off again. As expected, the top teams of Europe—the Manchesters’, the Madrids’, et al.—are back for the 64th edition of the League, but the surprise of the year is a return to the Champions League by Swiss side Young Boys BSC, a club based in Bern. Young Boys has not earned a spot in the Champions League for the last 32 years. Another drought ended this year, but only twelve years long, with AEK Athens qualifying for the League. Both teams just snuck into their qualifications by beating their last opponents in the qualifying round 3-2 on aggregate.
As for the top teams, some shake ups in the summer transfer window have given and taken life away for a few teams in their quest for the crown of Europe. For Manchester City, they’re big signing this summer was right wing Riyad Mahrez, formerly of Leicester City, who is going to give a boost to the already dominant Manchester City attack. However, the two trademark transfers of the summer were between Champions League teams. After a stunning appearance at the World Cup, Kylian Mbappe was transferred from A.S. Monaco to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) for almost fifty million pounds more than the other trademark transfer: Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo, a transfer from Real Madrid to Juventus, and Mbappe are two superstar players who could have a huge impact on the Champions League as the tournament winds down. For the past few years, PSG has struggled to defeat Chelsea in the knockout rounds of the tournament, but Mbappe’s speed and technical ability could give PSG the boost to break into the final rounds. Real Madrid will survive without Ronaldo.
The last three tournaments have been won by Real Madrid, with the help of Cristiano Ronaldo, so Madrid will have a tougher time reaching the final stages. On the other hand, Madrid’s lineup is a weird, but talented, mix of veterans and young players that might just have what it takes to pull the team into the semifinals or finals of the tournament. Juventus, the team that bought Ronaldo, is in a similar boat since adding the superstar, but they are just a little bit more experienced than the young players on the Madrid side.
Juventus is looking to end a 13-year championship drought with their purchases this summer, and they may just have what it takes to cruise through the group stage and dominate into the knockout round to a finals victory. The last two years have seen Juventus lose to the eventual champions, Real Madrid; now, the Juventus team has more experience, a little more talent, and the determination required to work through the dregs of Winter matches to earn a Champions League victory. If I was forced into picking a team to win, Juventus would be my choice. On the other hand, the Champions League is always a toss up in the knockout round, so look out for potential dark horse teams like PSG or Atletico Madrid to give the traditionally better teams a tough time.
One thing every Champions League fan can agree with, though, is the general lack of ability in English teams. The prediction I am going to make with true confidence is that no English team will make the semifinals this year. Recently, Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, was recently quoted in an interview with Spanish football news outlet Marca as saying, “The Premier League seems better than it is because of the way it’s sold and the way they broadcast the product.” Guardiola may have just meant the league as a whole is not as good as it seems, but I believe that top to bottom, English teams are oversold and cannot stand up to the other European giants: Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Juventus. Over the past few years, English teams have gone out earlier than expected (with few exceptions) and watch for the norm to hold true in this edition of the Champions League.

As the NFL starts getting into gear for their 2018-19 season, the MLB is wrapping up theirs. This week and next week, we’ll take a look at who’s in the mix for the postseason and who should be planning their offseason moves. This week, it’s the American League.
The American League (AL) in 2018 was marked by a few very good teams, and a lot of very bad teams. As it stands right now, eight of the fifteen AL teams have been eliminated from playoff contention, leaving seven to duke it out for five spots in the playoff picture. If the season ended today, the Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indians, Houston Astros, New York Yankees, and Oakland Athletics would end up rolling their way into the postseason. The Seattle Mariners have a small chance to sneak past the Athletics, but it would require an almost impossible winning streak to get close enough for it to be interesting.
The Boston Red Sox have been dominant all season, winning more than 100 games for just the fourth time in their storied team history, and they’re looking like the team to beat. Mookie Betts, J.D. Martinez, and Xander Boegarts have all had career years and bring the team power and speed on the basepaths. In terms of pitching, Chris Sale, David Price, and Rick Porcello have been an almost unstoppable trio of shutdown pitchers. Look for these guys in the World Series.
The Cleveland Indians have had the benefit of a weak division this year, although they still boast a dangerous lineup. Coming off of back-to-back playoff appearances, the Indians are prepared for another postseason run. Francisco Lindor, Edwin Encarnacion, and Jose Ramirez are big batters, and Corey Kluber, Carlos Carrasco, and Trevor Bauer (currently on the 10-day disabled list) can shut down opposing hitters. I’m not sure how far they’ll make it into the postseason, as the other four teams in the AL-Central will finish well below the .500 mark. However, the addition of Josh Donaldson, former Toronto Blue Jay and AL MVP might give the Indians a much-appreciated power boost if he can stay healthy.
The Houston Astros are trying to repeat as World Series Champions, and they have the players to get the job done. It’s almost entirely the same team from last year, with returning hitters like Carlos Correa, Jose Altuve, and World Series MVP George Springer all ready to make a push to give the Astros another World Series trophy. Offseason acquisition Gerrit Cole has backed up Justin Verlander, Dallas Keuchel, and Charlie Morton to give the Astros one of the best pitching rotations in baseball. Don’t let the idea of a sophomore slump color your thinking about this Houston team. They’re the real deal.
The New York Yankees. Not these guys again, right? That’s what I thought too, but then they traded for Andrew McCutchen and now, if the Pirates don’t make it into the postseason – which has a .04 percent chance of happening – they just might be the team I’ll be rooting for. The hitters on this team hammer the ball, with names like Giancarlo Stanton, Aaron Judge (who will hopefully be healthy in time to actually play), and rookie star Gleyber Torres all providing ample support in the hitting department, while a dangerous rotation from top-to-bottom, including guys like Luis Severino, J.A. Happ, and CC Sabathia, makes the pitching just as deadly as any other team in the playoff hunt. It’s the Yankees, so they always have some black magic up their sleeve. Don’t count these guys out just because they’re sitting in a wildcard spot.
The Oakland Athletics have been one of the most exciting teams in baseball to watch this year. Coming off a lackluster season in 2017, the Athletics stormed into playoff contention after the all-star break and kicked the Seattle Mariners right out of it. There’s not many names a casual baseball fan might recognize, but Khris Davis, who has walloped 42 homers so far, Matt Olson and Steven Piscotty all have dangerous swings, Matt Chapman is a shut-down third baseman, and their starting rotation including Mike Fiers and Trevor Cahill have the ability to go deep into games. I’d love to see the A’s win another World Series, especially if it means they’ll have to topple a powerhouse like the Red Sox to get there.
See you next week for a wrap of up the National League, and how it’s shaping up for the postseason.

The tenth-ranked Carnegie Mellon University women’s soccer team welcomed the fifth-ranked Messiah College to Pittsburgh in a top-ten matchup on Sept. 15. After a home win on Wednesday for their third victory in a row, the Tartans fell to the Messiah Falcons, 4-1, in  the team’s first loss of the season. They now have a 4-1 record on the season.
The game-deciding action occurred right in the opening minutes. The Falcons scored first at the two-minute mark with a goal to the far corner from 25 feet out. The visiting team struck again six minutes later on a penalty kick, after Tartan goalkeeper Carolyn Botz was penalized for tripping. The goal would ultimately become the game-winning goal. Two minutes later, in the 11th minute, the Tartans cut Messiah’s lead to 2-1 on a penalty kick by junior midfielder Sydney Webber.
In the following 10 minutes, the Tartans committed three fouls, which became a pattern throughout the match. In the 21st minute, the Falcons scored again, making the score 3-1. The Tartans tried to respond and dig themselves out of the two-point deficit for the rest of the match, but the Falcons defended well to complement their blistering offensive play. In the 41st, 43rd, and 44th minutes, the Tartans fired off three shots, two of them on goal, but were never able to reach the back of the net. Early in the second period, in the 57th minute, the Falcons scored the final goal of the game, ensuring their win with over 30 minutes left to play.
The Tartans finished with nine shots, four on goal, with two saves and two corner kicks. The Falcons recorded similar numbers, with eight shots, six on goal, with three saves and three corner kicks. However, the biggest difference in the match was penalties; the Tartans recorded 12, while the Falcons committed just five.
This week, the Tartans look to bounce back in the final match of their three-match homestand. On Friday, they face off against visiting Washington & Jefferson, set to begin at 7 p.m.

The start of the NFL season means something else: fantasy football is back! For the third consecutive year, The Tartan has formed a league, and this column will feature our weekly recaps through the end of the season, when we crown the Tartan Fantasy Football champion.
This year’s league consists of teams picked by staff members throughout The Tartan. My competitors are: Publisher Caleb Miller, Operations Manager Adam Tunnard, News Editor Nora Mattson, Visual Editor Tracy Le, Photo Editor Lisa Qian, and Pillbox Editors Izzy Sio and Michelle Madlansacay.
Since half the league had never played fantasy football or didn’t even know what it was, we decided to autodraft. While the suspense of a live draft is unmatched, the autodraft allowed us to start as fair as possible, and it was pretty cool to wake up to find a team ready for you. Getting players according to NFL.com’s top rankings led to some interesting matchups. Without further ado, here is Week 1’s recap.
futbol over Pillbox 132.64 to 120.68
In the highest-scoring matchup of the week, Visual Editor and fantasy football rookie Tracy Le’s team futbol defeated Pillbox Editor Izzy Sio’s aptly named team Pillbox.
Le’s team had one of the best autodrafts of the league, landing Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, Cincinnati Bengals running back Joe Mixon, and Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones. Each of her stars delivered: Newton passed for 161 yards and scored a rushing touchdown on his way to 18.24 points, Mixon rushed for 95 yards and a touchdown and added 54 yards through the air for 20.90 points, and Jones had 10 catches for 169 yards for 18 points. But it was Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Tyreek Hill who pushed the team to the win. Hill’s 169 yards, two touchdowns, and 91-yard punt return totaled to a team high of 29.30 points.
This league is Sio’s second this season, and she, a New York Jets fan, lamented that she autodrafted three New England Patriots players. No matter, she started Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who collected 21.28 points in a 277-yard and three-touchdown performance. Los Angeles Rams standout running back Todd Gurley rushed for 109 yards and a passing touchdown to 20.70 points. Pillbox was let down by Falcons running back Devonta Freeman who scored a measly 5 points, and is out for the next few weeks. Sio also left 20.20 points on the table by benching Green Bay Packers wide receiver Randall Cobb.
Slugs over Last Manning Standing 108.54 to 77.10
The only matchup of the week where both competitors were familiar with fantasy football ended up being quite anticlimactic; Operations Manager Adam Tunnard soundly beat Publisher Caleb Miller with three standout performances.
The top player on Tunnard’s team Slugs was Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who scored 24.94 with 286 passing yards and three touchdowns in a classic performance. Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans caught all seven passes thrown his way for 147 yards and a touchdown for 20.70 points. Los Angeles Chargers running back Melvin Gordon rushed for 64 yards, but amassed 18.60 points through 102 receiving yards.
Miller’s team Last Manning Standing was on a literal crutch at the start, as he forgot to bench Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz, who has been out with an injury since last season. Lackluster performances from Jacksonville Jaguars running back Leonard Fournette (5.50 points), Oakland Raiders wide receiver Amari Cooper (1.80 points), and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce (0.60 points) wasted 34.10 points from New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara on 141 yards from scrimmage, three touchdowns, and a two-point conversion. Hopefully Miller remembers to bench Wentz, but his only option, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, isn’t coming off a great Week 1.
newz over mmichelle123 106.84 to 99.26
This matchup between two fantasy football rookies was the closest of the week, with News Editor Nora Mattson’s team newz edging past Pillbox Editor Michelle Madlansacay’s self-named team mmichelle123.
Mattson’s newz defeated mmichelle123 through several reliable Week 1 performances. New York Giants running back Saquon Barkley scored 18.80 points on 106 yards on the ground and a touchdown, Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski had 16.30 points on 123 receiving yards and a touchdown, and Detroit Lions wide receiver Golden Tate caught a respectable 79 yards with a touchdown for 13.90 points. Despite the win, Mattson should look to starting Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers, who amassed a team-high 28.96 points on the bench, while her starter, Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford, scored just 8.04 points.
Madlansacay’s team, mmichelle123, was projected to take the win over newz, but some good performances were marred by lost points on the bench. Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins threw for 244 yards and two touchdowns, totaling 20.36 points, and Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown recorded 93 yards and a touchdown for 15.30, a relatively low point total for him, but still decent nonetheless. Starting running backs Alex Collins of the Baltimore Ravens and Derrick Henry of the Tennessee Titans and Eagles tight end Zach Ertz scored only 13.80 points combined, bringing her team down.
TARTAN FANTASY over Gin and Bear It 82.64 to 58.22
As Sports Editor, I am beyond embarrassed to have scored a paltry 58.22 points, but I can explain (see below). Congrats to Photo Editor Lisa Qian for her first ever win in her first ever experience playing fantasy football.
Qian’s simply-titled team TARTAN FANTASY didn’t have to put up a lot of points to win, but her team still boasted performances worth smiling about. While like me, one of her players (Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin) didn’t score a point, but unlike me, she had other players to fall back on. Saints wide receiver Michael Thomas’ 22 points from 180 yards and a touchdown carried her team, which also saw Packers tight end Jimmy Graham score only 0.80 points. Next week, Qian should look to starting Saints quarterback Drew Brees over Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson, who didn’t have a great first week.
In the end, one player decided the week for me. When I autodrafted stellar Steelers running back Le’veon Bell, I was at first celebrating, until I remembered that he was sitting out games over a contract dispute. I traded for running back James Conner, who took Bell’s place as the Steelers’ starter. But I forgot to start him. Conner’s 29.20 points would have given me the win, but instead, I wasted a 20.42-point week from Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson and 11 points from the always-reliable Ravens kicker Justin Tucker.
In Week 2, Sio’s Pillbox faces off against Miller’s Last Manning Standing, and Madlansacay and I battle for our first win. In the matchups of Week 1’s winners, Le’s futbol looks to defeat Tunnard’s Slugs and Qian’s TARTAN FANTASY takes on Mattson’s newz. Check back next week to read how it all goes down.

From Bigfoot to King Kong, people have been faking photographs and videos for as long as the media have existed. 
With advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, creating fakes has become much easier in recent years. Researchers in the Robotics Institute here at Carnegie Mellon have developed a new algorithm to “retarget” videos: that is, they can take the content from one video and apply the style of another. 
The team approached this problem using a class of algorithms called generative adversarial networks (GANs). This is an unsupervised method, which means that the computer can do it without human intervention. Classic GANs consists of two “competing” systems: one to generate an image, called the generator, and one to classify it as real or fake, called the discriminator. The goal of the generator is to fool the discriminator; the information from the discriminator then feeds back into the generator, helping it make better and better fakes. 
This study, however, added another dimension to the algorithm. While previously only using spatial information, in this work the researchers combined both spatial and temporal information. Their new algorithm, which they call Recycle-GAN, makes the new videos smoother and more believable. 
One inspiration for the work is the film industry. “I think there are a lot of stories to be told,” said Aayush Bansal, a PhD student and the study’s lead author.
Video retargeting has the potential to drastically reduce the cost of creating special effects in movies, or convert black-and-white films to color. It can also be applied to self-driving cars. The cars’ computers are trained to recognize their surroundings using labeled videos. While footage from well-lit scenes is easy to label, labeling videos of stormy or dark scenes is difficult. Recycle-GAN, however, can retarget these easily labeled fair-weather daytime scenes into nighttime scenes or storms, making it a useful training tool for difficult driving conditions.
You can find videos demonstrating the effectiveness of the Recycle-GAN team’s technique on their paper’s webpage. Each video shows side-by-side footage of the originals and the results. In the first, a clip of John Oliver is retargeted to the style of Stephen Colbert. The original video of Oliver is next to that of Colbert— their lips moving, heads bobbing, eyes blinking, and even hands gesturing at the same time. They have also applied their method to flowers blooming, clouds moving across the sky, and origami birds, in addition to celebrities and politicians. 
Of course, in the era of fake news, this technology has led to concern over what are called deep fakes: altered videos that make people appear to do or say things that never actually happened. 
The controversy began when videos containing celebrities’ faces superimposed onto those of actors in pornographic movies appeared online. Now, the fake videos are also becoming a concern for politicians. On Sept. 13, three members of Congress wrote a letter to the Director of National Intelligence, asking him look into the national security threat deep fakes could present. Citing concerns over blackmail and election meddling, the letter states that deep fakes could be “used by foreign or domestic actors to spread misinformation.” Videos like this can already be found online. Buzzfeed, along with comedian Jordan Peele, created a fake video of President Obama as a public service announcement on the dangers of deep fakes. The video, which includes Obama calling President Trump a “dipshit,” encourages vigilance when considering the authenticity of content from the internet. 
Some fear that the reverse is also possible — public figures might deny doing or saying things caught on video, claiming those videos as fakes. 
These issues have created a counter-field: a community of academics, national intelligence agencies and news organizations, who are working to differentiate between real videos and fakes. Some predict the beginning of an arms race, as both these fields become more sophisticated. While currently the average viewer can tell that the videos are a little “off," the technology will only improve with time, making fake videos more and more realistic. 
If you are ever in doubt about the authenticity of a video you come across online, remember: you probably won’t catch the real Obama saying “stay woke bitches” anytime soon.

This week, the Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation was awarded the role of Power Connector in the American-Made Solar Prize, a competition run by the Department of Energy (DOE) and their National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to foster innovation in the solar industry. As a Power Connector, the Scott Institute will receive funding to bolster recruitment for competition entries, and will be able to earn further grants if entrants they recruit are successful.
The goal of the Solar Prize is to spur the creation of innovative solar energy solutions and reenergize the American solar industry. It is composed of three successive competitions for researchers who seek funding to make their ideas regarding solar energy a reality, the winner receiving a $3 million dollar prize. The DOE hopes to connect inventors with entrepreneurs and funding sources at an early stage, and to give innovative researchers access to state-of-the-art technology and laboratories.
The Scott Institute and other Power Connectors have already received $100,000 from the DOE’s Solar Energy Technologies Office as compensation for their involvement in the competition. According to the Scott Institute’s communications analyst Amanda King, the Institute has “expanded and amplified the DOE and the [NREL’s] efforts in this competition” and will “execute a long-term sustainable strategy for scaling the American-Made Solar Prize,” in addition to entering many of its faculty members and students into the competition.
A few faculty members and students have already joined the Solar Prize, such as Professor B. Erik Ydstie and his cadre of student research assistants. Ydstie is a chemical engineering professor who is working on refining the production of silicon wafers, an integral component of solar cells. His research focuses on a more efficient method of manipulating the microstructure of Horizontal Ribbon Growth to create thin silicon. This method produces drastically less waste than older methods. Many students are currently helping Ydstie acquire funding and create partnerships to move forward with commercializing his project. 
The Institute’s staff have pledged to support entrants and provide guidance throughout the competition. Executive director for Innovations and Strategic Partnerships Anna J. Siefken and her team will meet with competitors in November on campus for a coaching day. Competitors will also be able to attend CMU Energy Week from March 25 to March 28, an event in which they can acquire further coaching and introduce themselves to investors. Additionally, Amanda King, the Scott Institute’s communications analyst, has expressed excitement at acquiring the services of an Entrepreneur-in-Residence who will give advice to competitors and help with networking.
“The [Scott Institute] will help competitors through each of the three stages of the competition by providing mentorship and access to support resources on a national level to solar technology entrepreneurs in PA, OH, WV, MD, DE, VA, and Washington, D.C.,” said King. The NREL chose Power Connectors who it believed would increase the number of viable submissions to its competition. In the selection process, the NREL placed emphasis on networking strength, past successes, and creativity. The Scott Institute was a strong contender due to its many partnerships in the Mid-West, Mid-Atlantic, and other regions. 
Winners of the Ready! Contest, the Solar Prize’s first stage, will be announced next November. Competitors in the Ready! Contest must formulate a plan of action to solidify their ideas and goals. Set! and Go! Contest winners will be announced in February and June of next year, respectively. The Set! Contest involves creating a proof of concept; in the final stage, inventors work on actually developing a prototype and searching for pilot partners.
Thanks to its large network of partners and resources, the Solar Prize competition presents a great opportunity for the Scott Institute to make a lasting impact on the solar industry.

Finding large, high-quality datasets has long been a daunting task for scientists, researchers, and journalists. 
On Sept. 5, internet search giant Google launched a public beta version of their solution, a specialized search tool called Dataset Search. The tool allows users to locate open databases and files matching their keywords tagged with appropriate metadata.
Although public data has become increasingly available since the rapid growth of the internet, large databases are often scattered throughout various organizations’ websites. In addition, catalogs of datasets are often grouped by topic, making it difficult for researchers to obtain data not directly related to their field of study. Natasha Noy, a research scientist in Google’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) division and key architect of Dataset Search, says the goal of the project is to make data discoverable. “Scientists say, ‘I know where I need to go to find my datasets, but that’s not what I always want,’” she said to The Verge. “Once they step out of their unique community, that’s when it gets hard.”
The public beta of the search tool resembles Google’s classic search. It’s a simple white home page featuring the words “Google Dataset Search Beta” and a simple search bar. Underneath the search bar are a few suggestions for search terms: “Try boston education data or weather site:noaa.gov.” The search results page diverges a little from the classic layout — it more closely resembles Google’s updated layout for the Gmail inbox, with rounded corners and plenty of white space.
After a search term is entered, the list of search results appears on the left side rather than on the center of the page. The rest of the page is occupied by a panel that gives details about the dataset that’s selected on the left-hand panel. It includes any available metadata and contextual information, including any dates it was created, updated, or published; time period and geographical area covered by the data; and authors of the dataset.
Jeni Tennison, CEO of the Open Data Institute, believes the involvement of a major search engine will be helpful. “Simply understanding how people search is important… what kind of terms they use, how they express them.” Tennison added, “Dataset search has always been a difficult thing to support, and I’m hopeful that Google stepping in will make it easier.”
This is far from Google’s first foray into academic research tools, of course. Google Scholar, a specialized search for academic publications, has been available since 2004. The company has also used Knowledge Graph, an AI-based information organization tool, to display topical information such as definitions and related images next to web search results since 2012, with data sourced from the CIA World Factbook and Freebase, among others. More recently, Google has launched an outreach program to university faculty and students for AI research and has worked to make hardware for the TensorFlow machine learning framework available to researchers for free.
In its current form, Dataset Search is limited to content from NASA, NOAA, and Harvard’s Dataverse, along with a few other institutional sources. Dataset Search pulls data from Knowledge Graph, but the web crawler is unable to intelligently gather information about datasets like it can for webpages. There is also no way to programmatically access Dataset Search, which could hinder researchers who want to make large numbers of rapid automated queries. Most significantly, Google requires that publishers tag datasets with metadata such as descriptions, file size, and authors, which can be a time-consuming and labor-intensive process.
However, Mark Hahnel, CEO of Figshare (a research repository website based in London), is confident that data publishers will quickly adapt to providing metadata. “By November [2017], all the universities we’re working for had their stuff marked up,” he said to Nature. With Google involved, it is more likely that new datasets will be properly tagged and categorized as they are released. As funding agencies increasingly insist that research data is made public, Hahnel believes using Dataset Search is a logical next step. “It legitimizes what the funders have been trying to do,” he said, adding, “I think this is a game changer for open data in the academia.”

A Brazilian museum burns down; 20 million invaluable items of historical and scientific significance are destroyed forever. Ecce Homo, a spanish fresco, is disfigured in a botched restoration. Thousands of languages are expected to go extinct by the end of the century. Religious icons are desecrated and the Temple of Bel is destroyed in the ancient trading city and cultural center Palmyra. Whether through human error, natural disaster, or deliberate sabotage, invaluable records of human history have been lost or irreparably damaged. The question is, what artifacts or works can be saved from the passage of time, what steps can be taken to do so, and how should we prioritize what to keep? This week in Pugwash, we discussed the answers to those questions, and brought up some new ones we couldn’t find an answer for.
In an optimistic future, humanity may develop replicator technology that would allow us to scan an object at the atomic level and break it down into a collection of patterns. Even though such an atomic structure compression algorithm would reduce the amount of data needed to recreate an item, it still brings up a “Ship of Theseus” style dilemma. Is the original important for its own sake or would storing a molecular blueprint of the object be enough?
Besides physical objects of value, information stored digitally might also be worth preserving. The increasing availability of computer and networking technology has created an internet explosion, with the number of users growing exponentially, from 16 million in 1995 to 4.2 billion today. This raises concerns about practicality as well as the safety of this uncurtailed expansion. 
As ubiquitous as the web may seem, it’s not impervious to harm. The Cloud really refers to computer server warehouses distributed across the world. The machine can break down, the entire building may crumble from severe weather or an earthquake. A meticulously planned attack can dismantle security and compromise petabytes of data (1PB = 1024 TB). Any data centers that have an interface to the rest of the web potentially have vulnerabilities that could exploited by someone with the skill and will to do so. The consequences of such events could be the erasure, or corruption of a non-trivial portion of the internet. If there is any private user data, it could be searched through and/or sold to malicious parties. Even though companies take many precautions to protect their data, the sheer number of opportunities for hackers has increased the frequency of this new type of crime.
Currently, our approach to storing data is one of digital hoarding. Every minute, 300 hours of video get uploaded to Youtube alone, not to mention the multitude of social media posts, articles, and art. Like in The Lion King, there's more to see here, than can ever be seen. Also like in The Lion King, there’s part of the internet savanna not touched by light of day, teeming with some of it’s nastier denizens. The ease of uploading anything and everything may cause one to forget how expensive storing all that data actually is. To support their one million servers, Google needs 220 MegaWatts of power. Manufacturing the data storage devices themselves and all communication infrastructure to go with it is also resource and energy intensive. Will the eventual solution be a government organization employing millions of individuals to comb through the never ending content? A “Worthy Media Committee” that determines what has cultural significance, and what can be deleted in the near future? This could become a dangerously Orwellian scenario, especially if such an organization acts upon a political agenda.

Derived from rapper Eminem’s hit 2000 song of the same name, “stan” can mean a multitude of things, from a successful fan account that posts photos, news, and updates about an artist almost religiously, to a troll with intentions of bullying anyone who criticizes their icon of choice. Stan culture has grown and changed significantly with the aid of Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and other social media websites. Unfortunately, the latter situation has often taken charge, as bullying, “dragging,” or calling out certain celebrities has gained popularity and thousands of retweets, shares, and likes. 
These fans continue to dominate the internet, even in times of mourning. On Sept. 7, one of the most beloved and respected rappers in the industry passed away at age 26: Malcolm McCormick, better known as Mac Miller. Across all social media networks, fans, fellow artists, and regular people paid their respects with videos, pictures, or 280-character tweets. However, lurking behind the outpour of love and pain were fans who blamed Miller’s death on the one person who “could have helped him”: Ariana Grande.
Ariana Grande, a highly successful pop icon, faced the wrath of trolls the second her split with Mac Miller was announced back in May 2018. Most notably, a tweet by Twitter user Elijah Flint went viral with nearly 20,000 retweets and 83,000 likes. The tweeter insinuated that Grande should not have left Miller—especially because he wrote an entire album devoted to her—because the split “caused” Miller to get a DUI. Just hours later, Grande gave a response to the double standard presented by Flint: a woman should not be expected to magically heal her significant other, especially when the situation becomes toxic—she is another human, not his savior.
Again, the argument that Grande should have “saved him” came to light following the passing of Mac Miller. The negative comments notably came from Instagram, as users accused her of “killing him,” of being “evil,” and of ignoring her “responsibility” to speak out. The stream of comments grew so cruel and overbearing that Grande had no choice but to disable her Instagram comments. For a week following the death of a man she once truly loved, Ariana Grande mourned peacefully and independently, without the poisonous influence of stans.
This past Friday, Grande broke her silence and wrote an emotional, moving tribute to Mac Miller—someone that made a significant impact in her life for two years—on Instagram, along with a video of them together. Her words were heartfelt and honest, not bitter or mean. She was praised for her tribute across social media platforms for its equally heartwarming and saddening nature.
This issue is deeply rooted in the double standard placed on women to help, heal, and tend to men; but when a woman is in trouble, she is at fault and responsible for caring for herself. What we need to do as a society is to stop placing the burden of one’s mental health and life problems on a single person, whether it is a friend, a family member, or a romantic partner. Ariana Grande is not, and never will be, a man’s manic pixie dream girl, a fairy who can heal him with the snap of her fingers. This expectation, however is not to be confused with the genuine care of loved ones in need of mental help; the “savior” expectation, in contrast, can become toxic and emotionally draining. In actuality, refuting the claims of stans, Grande stated that she prayed incredibly hard for Mac Miller’s sobriety—even when their time together had come to an end. 
Social media will always be influential, powerful, and unstoppable. The stan culture that has emerged from social media has had its positives, whether it entails worshipping and appreciating artists, or creating a space for people to interact and share their respect of a celebrity. With this positivity, however, comes a dark side that consists of bullying, trolling, and biting fights between two fandoms, two opposing beliefs, or two people. There is a line that is crossed when mourning a celebrity death online, especially one as significant and painful as the passing of Pittsburgh native Mac Miller. This time it was crossed. But in the end, we lost a highly respected, talented, and beautiful man. May Mac Miller rest in peace.

Introspection and reflection are requisites for growth.
As Carnegie Mellon students, I’m sure that all of you have heard that message in one form or another, be it through lectures, seminars, or newsletters. While it feels like the university talks about the concept of mental wellness ad nauseam—especially to the first years—it doesn’t change the fact that it’s a priority. After all, getting a degree isn’t worth going off the deep end, and it’s wonderful to be in a college environment where that’s given due emphasis.
What can you do about your mental wellness?
The school offers excellent resources like the mindfulness room and free subscriptions to Headspace, and while meditation and relaxation are very important, I’d like to suggest another healthy practice: reading classical literature.
I’m sure we all have bad memories from high school of cramming Sparknotes and Cliffnotes the night before an English test because we were too lazy or unwilling to do the assigned reading. The syntax and diction were too confusing, the books were too long, and in the frenetic atmosphere that characterizes secondary education, nobody had time for that.
It seems that for many, the habit of reading for pleasure has fallen by the wayside, overshadowed by other competing demands. When we do read, it’s commonly popular fiction or works of technical interest rather than the authors of old. While there’s nothing wrong with that, those pieces primarily entertain us or add to our body of knowledge rather than prompting us to think about our own lives on a deeper and more personal level.
That’s precisely why classical literature in a recreational capacity is so important. Well before the onset of the digital age, brilliant thinkers focused on answering the great questions about life and human nature, and lucky for us they put pen to paper, handing their insights down through history.
Without the aid of Google or Wikipedia, past writers relied on their own intuitions, observations, and reflections, looking within themselves and out to the world for inspiration. When they found something noteworthy, they either delivered it through narrative (as in Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle) or they just compiled their ideas and presented them to the audience (as in Henry David Thoreau’s Walden).  
In reading such works, we in part retrace the author’s steps, seeing the world through their perspective and listening to what they have to say. Often, we are exposed to worldly and novel ways of thinking, and we sometimes find answers to our own problems. These are the books that relieve us of our tunnel vision, forcing us to consider the bigger, more abstract picture. We expand our horizons, adding to the richness of our thoughts and the serenity of our minds. Like a tree, the more entrenched we are in the body of human wisdom, the less likely we are to be blown aside by the winds of adversity, guided by those who came before us.
Does this mean that you must understand every single word that you read? Nope; it’s the central ideas that matter most. Should you go and read (or reread) Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter or Milton’s Paradise Lost right now? Of course not. But I encourage you, the next time you’re trying to find a book to invest in, consider some of the older titles. You just might be surprised by how much you enjoy—and how much you can gain from—the books you once demonized.
By the way, we’re only talking about mental wellness here. Unfortunately, reading books won’t make you physically fit; you still have to hit the gym for that.

We honor corrupt philanthropists
and learn the history of White America
through White Spectacles.
Our faculty’s White Faces gleam in projector lights,
their White Hands are tainted by chalk dust
and Expo markers,
and surely they understand the implications of education,
but
my heart hurts
as brown hands serve dollops of food
and swipe our cards;
as white hands cut vibrant ribbons commemorating vibrant White Money;
brown eyes exchange understanding for a fleeting moment before looking the other way.
They pass with
emblems of late night grease
plastered above their hearts--
wear your uniform with pride, no one grumbles.
My hurt hurts
yet I know
the condition of my little heart
is not enough
to abate an issue
larger than CMU itself.

I recently got around to watching Crazy Rich Asians. It was a film that I had been looking forward to watching for quite some time. The trailers weren’t very impressive, but the film was being marketed as Hollywood’s first all-Asian cast in 25 years. To top if off, critics tripped over themselves to shower the film with praise. Audiences loved it, Crazy Rich Asians exploded at the box office, and it made people cry. So, against my normal jaded nature, I was relatively excited to watch this film. 
I left the theater unenthused, disappointed by a film that had so much potential yet squandered a lot of it. It certainly is an important milestone for Hollywood, yet it was very cheesy, safe and cliche rather than being subversive and smart. It’s stylistically very bland, with uninspired cinematography and shot composition despite some wonderful production design. Save for a handful of individual, incredible scenes I won’t spoil, the characterization and plotting are generally uninteresting and occasionally frustrating. It felt very much like a Hollywood product than something authentic and genuine. Because of all of this, it felt more like a movie trying to pander towards Asians and Americans too lazy to watch a foreign film rather than being an actual movie that just happened to be about Asians who are also crazy rich. 
If you take away the fact that the characters are Chinese, the film doesn’t really hold up as a romantic comedy. Yet, despite the movie being about the lives of a Chinese family in Singapore, it doesn’t do much on that front either. The reason for this is that the character writing and plotting is considerably formulaic. The film could have had a more of a satirical bite to its humor, which there were only hints of throughout the film. Nick and Rachel, the two protagonists, could have had a lot more tension between them for Nick’s family secret. The Big Sick did this very well, where protagonists Kumail and Emily are driven apart by Kumail’s decision to hide his family’s secret from Emily, which created a lot of interesting conflict and arcs for them. Even many of the side characters could have been less one-note in Crazy Rich Asians or could have done more to add to Rachel’s arc. There was clearly effort put into the film, but there is also a very conscious feeling that the film is self-aware of what it represents, so the script plays it mostly safe. 
Crazy Rich Asians is one significant part of this new diversity trend that has swept Hollywood in the last few years. In my usage of the word “trend”, I am not trying to say that diversity is bad. Rather, Hollywood treats diversity like a marketing gimmick rather than a cause to be championed. It fills a niche market for a certain demographic, and other audience members who are not totally against that initiative tag along to watch it, and the film profits. It’s unfortunate that diversity is relevant if and only if the bottom line is involved, which makes the success of Crazy Rich Asians that much more important. But taken as a whole, the movie can’t seem to be separated from the entire marketing, which is somewhat troubling for the discussion about the merits of the film as well as the surrounding political discourse.
Part of this marketing strategy, of course, is that if money isn’t made on the gimmick, then Hollywood has no incentive to do it again. Diversity has always existed, but as the media tends to do, an observation of a diverse casting gets overblown and overhyped. Hollywood executives notice this and realize that they can capitalize on it, but are also typically hesitant at the idea of giving original scripts and good roles to diverse casts that aren’t based on previous intellectual properties, such as a superhero cinematic universe or upcoming remakes of older films. Crazy Rich Asians differs in that way where now there is a script with potential available for a diverse cast. Yet, there is always a risk involved for the producers. If the movie doesn’t do well, then that would mean that having a diverse cast isn’t marketable or profitable, and Hollywood would stop. So then the movie is safe and appeals to a mass in a certain time period rather than standing as a work of art that will last a long time. 
It also helps shield the film from criticism. Having gone through several reviews to try and see what made the film critically successful and taking anecdotal accounts from friends, a lot of the praise was consistently focused on the casting and cultural impact rather than any other element of the film. Even negative reviews of the film have to acknowledge it because it is such a significant portion of the film. However, then this brings us back to square one, where without the diverse cast, the film doesn’t have much else to offer as a result. 
To end this article, let’s talk about a little film I watched in the same week called Searching. Essentially, the film takes place entirely over a computer, where a man searches through the rabbit hole known as the Internet for clues in order to find his missing daughter. It takes a very by-the-numbers plot and turns it into a smart and subversive thriller with lots of suspense, visual detail and storytelling, memorable characters regardless of how small their roles are, and real emotional weights towards the end. It also features an Asian lead, but the fact that he is Asian doesn’t matter. That’s where Hollywood should be heading, and slowly, with movies like Searching, it is heading there. But in order to get there, movies like Crazy Rich Asians need to do well too. 
So my request is to see films like Crazy Rich Asians so that films like Searching can be made, where better scripts are given to diverse casts. Then watch films like Searching so that more original scripts can keep being made. Eventually, with some effort and voting with our wallets, we can get rid of the term diversity entirely and instead have an inclusionary casting process, where different demographics and ethnicities are the norm rather than a reactionary cultural trend.

What is it about romantic comedies that makes them so good? They’re pretty ridiculous most of the time, and yet my friends and I can’t stop watching them. To be honest, ever since Netflix added the first and second Princess Diaries, the only movies I’ve wanted to watched after are movies just like it: 13 Going on 30, all three Bridget Jones’ Diary movies, Clueless, To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before, and the list goes on… At the moment, I’m actually in the middle of watching Netflix’s newly added teen romantic comedy, Sierra Burgess is a Loser.
The thing about these kinds of movies is that most of the storylines are reused and therefore predictable, the chances of the events in the movie actually happening to you are nearly impossible, and yet everything about these movies is so relatable. Now, let me clarify: for me rom coms are pretty spot-on with what I wish had happened to me in high school. Finally gaining my self-confidence, getting back at mean girls, finding true love in the end - these were all things I had hoped to achieve by the end of my high school career. I mean, if the main characters of these movies were able to do it in the span of an hour and forty-five minutes, then there was definitely a possibility for me to get this happily ever after ending at the end of my four years of high school. Of course that wasn’t the case for me, as well as for many others.
But as I move further and further away from my high school years, I’ve realized that I’ve actually been creating my own happily ever after, just by learning more about myself. In high school I defined happy endings based on those from the rom coms I watched, because I guess I didn’t know any better? At the time I was still figuring myself out, and to be honest I still am. But at least now, I have a better idea of what I want and value in life. Learning all this just happened over time and through gaining more experience. The stories in rom coms are a huge representation of who I used to and wanted to be, and looking back on that is very amusing to me.
It’s crazy that my past love for rom coms came just from me wishing I was the characters in those movies. Now, I love watching them because they bring back old memories and feelings from when I was a more inexperienced and immature version of myself. The characters and their stories are things I can still laugh at, cringe at, and occasionally swoon over. I don’t really care how ridiculous and unrealistic romantic comedies are, watching them will always be one of my favorite guilty pleasures.

Dear Izzy,
It’s the first month of school, and I honestly only have one goal this year – and no, it is not to have a 4.0 QPA. My one goal this year is to better my own mental health. I’m starting to realize how much time I’ve been investing into my academics, my extracurriculars, and my job search and obsessing over how I want everything to work out for me. But overall, it’s been stressing me out and taking some of my time away from the friends and the people who care about me. So this year, I’m really trying to have a better work-social life balance. Do you have any tips on how to get me started?
Sincerely,
Having Equal Allotments Leads To Happiness, I Surely Want Even Any, Like, Time, Help
Dear HEALTH IS WEALTH,
First of all, go you for realizing the importance of your own mental health! And also, go you for realizing it this early in the semester. It can be easy to forget these kinds of things throughout the year, but it’s a really important priority that some people, myself definitely included, neglect.
The first thing I’d suggest is time management. Plan out when you want to work and how long you want to work for. Having that time frame will help keep the rest of your day in perspective. Most importantly, don’t forget to plan out breaks! They will help you relax a little bit from work. And with that work-life balance, you can do whatever you want.
To add onto that, write down a list of the things you love. It’ll help you remember them for those moments when you feel like you’re stressing out too much, or you’re burnt out, or you’re just overworked. And during those moments, do something from that list. Take time to remember the things you love and cherish. Doing so just might give you the much needed energy to solve that problem you’ve been stuck on or to come up with that last sentence in your paper.
Most importantly, you’re not alone. Take time to remember the people you love and cherish too. It is so easy to accidentally close yourself off from your friends in college, but don’t forget to reach out to them – even if you’re just going to grab dinner. Having friends, companions, and just other people by your side is the best way to lift up your spirits.
Hope this helps!
Izzy

After waking up on Saturday, I knew I’d have so much to do in the morning that I sadly wouldn’t have time to make an actual breakfast. So I packed some snacks in my bag and went to campus to go take care of some of my responsibilities. By the time I was finished with everything it was already around twelve, which I guess is a fine time for brunch. So a couple of my friends and I decided to stay close to campus, and we went to Union Grill. 
The location: Union Grill is right in the middle of Craig Street, so it’s super close to campus. The restaurant usually stands out to me because of its nice plants for its outdoor seating. And also, since the outdoor seating is basically right on the sidewalk, every person that walks by the restaurant can see who’s sitting outside and the food they're eating. It's a nice way of enticing customers. 
The food: I didn’t realize this until recently, but the fish dishes at Union Grill are really fresh! The past few times I’ve gone, I’ve ordered the salmon burger and it never disappoints. The salmon was cooked perfectly and although they keep the sandwich pretty simple with two buns, lettuce, tomato, and a pickle, all the natural flavors just blend so well together. It even comes with your choice of salsa or spread to add a little more flavor if you’d like; I usually ask for the corn salsa. And most meals you order at Union Grill come with sides, like their famous waffle fries, fresh veggies, or mashed potatoes. They do give you a lot of food, but for pretty decent prices!
The vibe: I often get an old school vibe whenever I go to Union Grill, I guess because most of the people who eat there are families and senior citizens. I really enjoy the comfortable social atmosphere of the restaurant; it sometimes makes me forget that I’m even near a college campus. 
Lit or Nah: I wouldn’t say it’s very lit, but there is a pretty big bar where people can order their drinks/food and at the same time watch sports on the big flat screens. I would say Union Grill is too much of a family go-to place for it to be anything else, which definitely isn’t a bad thing. The food’s good, the people are nice, and I think it’s a great place to go for any meal of the day.

This weekend, the most ambitious crossover event in history returns to McConomy Auditorium! In Marvel Studios' nineteenth movie, Avengers: Infinity War, the stakes for the Avengers have never been higher as they must come together to stop the mad titan, Thanos (Josh Brolin), from collecting all six Infinity Stones, which are ancient cosmic artifacts that enable its user to control all aspects of reality. This summer's biggest blockbuster (and the fourth highest-grossing movie of all time) is the culmination of ten years of Marvel Studios history, and it pays off throughout the movie's entire two and a half-hour runtime. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo perfectly balance elements of humor and darkness, the screen time of at least twenty-one characters, and differing yet compelling perspectives of our heroes as well as the fiercest villain that they've ever faced. Writers and Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) architects, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, help to elevate the movie to new heights within the MCU by launching it into new storytelling territory for Marvel's future slate of movies. Josh Brolin delivers a defining and legendary performance as one of the best and most terrifying villains in Marvel Studios history, holding his own against Marvel Studios veterans Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Benedict Cumberbatch. And even in its bleakest moments, it's impossible not to have a great time during every grand character entrance, every quick-witted quip, and every epic fight. Avengers: Infinity War promises to be not just a classic Marvel Studios film, but a classic blockbuster for decades to come.

A sea of people, mostly college students, engulfed the unassuming Blue Slide Park playground this past Tuesday, Sept. 11. As song after song rang through the park Mac Miller made famous, his fans celebrated the life of someone they considered an inspiration. Despite the jovial energy, the gloomy overcast weather that evening reflected the sense of loss that hung thick in the air.
On Friday, Sept. 7, Mac Miller — Pittsburgh native and world famous rap artist — was found dead in his Los Angeles home due to an apparent drug overdose. He was only 26 years old.
Mac Miller’s fifth studio album, Swimming, was released on Aug. 3 to great acclaim from both fans and critics. On Oct. 27, he was set to go on tour, accompanied by renowned bassist Thundercat and rap artist JID. The last tweet he sent reads “I just want to go on tour.”
Born Malcolm McCormick, Miller was raised in the Point Breeze neighborhood of Pittsburgh, just a couple of miles from Carnegie Mellon. He was Bar Mitzvahed at Rodef Shalom, a reform synagogue located on Fifth Avenue. At age 15, while attending Taylor Allderdice High School, he recorded his first mixtape on his laptop.
At age 18, Miller signed to Rostrum Records and released KIDS, his breakthrough mix-tape. KIDS featured some of his fan’s favorite tracks to date. In 2010 he told the Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle, “I wanted to create a voice for a generation of regular kids who can relate to this music, like a soundtrack to their lives.”
Mac Miller stood out because he rapped about his personal journeys with love, struggles with depression, and dreams of success. He had the braggadocious delivery one might expect of a rapper, but kept it authentic and sometimes even profound. On “Under the Weather”, a standout track from his first studio album, Blue Slide Park, Miller raps “You can have the world in the palm of your hands but it don’t mean a thing till you change it.”
“His music meant a whole lot to me and helped me through some really dark times in my life,” said one fan who spoke at the vigil, a sentiment undoubtedly shared by many others. Jon Hewson, another vigil attendee attested that he  felt ”like [Miller] was really honest in his music, I feel like he really understood me.”
Mac Miller remains one of Pittsburgh’s most iconic artists. The pride he had for his hometown was evident in his 2011 album, Blue Slide Park, named after the park Miller grew up at. It was the first independently released album to top the charts in 16 years, selling 145,000 copies were sold in the first week. Songs like “Party on Fifth Ave” also referenced Pittsburgh, and the music video for the album’s single “Frick Park Market” has over 38 million views.
Lucas Ochoa, a senior in Human-Computer Interaction and Design at Carnegie Mellon who also attended the vigil voiced that “[Miller] sung about Pittsburgh in a way that made me really proud to have grown up here.”
A plethora of artists and musicians expressed their grief and shock on Twitter. The Internet, who backed Miller on a 2013 tour, along with Chance the Rapper, Earl Sweatshirt, Vince Staples, and Action Bronson, tweeted that “Mac treated everyone like we were headliners.”
Miller struggled with drug abuse for a long time, and made mention of it in his music. “Don’t tell my momma got a drug problem,” he casually raps on “Polo Jeans,” a standout track on his 2014 mix-tape, Faces.
“Malcolm had been so far up and then down the other side and up again,” wrote George Lange, a Pittsburgh native and longtime friend of Miller’s family. “I am just incredibly sad about Malcolm. He was so...so close to his greatest moment — and in one fragile step was gone.”
Organized by Pittsburgh music label, Nightfall Records, the vigil for the beloved rapper received help from food vendors and the police department. An estimated 2,000 people gathered at the Blue Slide Park vigil on Tuesday, according to Commander Herman of the Pittsburgh Police Department who described this event as “The Blue Slide Woodstock.”
The park felt alive with love and appreciation as people honored Miller in different ways. In one section of the park, there was a live spray painting of a black and white mural of the rapper donning a gold halo. In another, a petition signing to rename a section of the park “Mac Miller Blue Slide Park.” Most notable was the throng of people surrounding the famous sloping blue slide, which had been repainted that day in preparation for the vigil.
As night fell, the music from the speakers and the murmurs from the crowd died down. The dark sky grew brighter as people began lighting their candles and raising them in the air. Emotions ran high as the night concluded with a moment of silence for the deceased Pittsburgh rapper.

A crowd of over 2,500 people gathered on Thursday to celebrate the grand opening of the David A. Tepper Quadrangle. Beneath crimson Carnegie Mellon banners and streams of sunlight shining through the atrium’s vast glass ceiling, onlookers watched as 13 members of the community stood, scissors in hand, waiting to cut the ribbon. This moment marked the official end of three years of promotion, construction, and anticipation over the massive new addition to the Carnegie Mellon campus.
The 315,000 square foot, $201 million building is something of an architectural gem. Its exterior juts out over Forbes Avenue with angular swathes of bricks and glass, broken up by sharp off-axis rooms and outcroppings. The interior is contrastingly smooth, featuring rounded levels around the atrium and an arcing glass roof to provide natural lighting. Of the few rooms in the building that do not have a window, all of them have at least one glass wall.
Along with its aesthetics, the building boasts innovative sustainability efforts. The abundant natural light reduces the amount of electricity consumed for lighting, and each level has a network of heating tubes running through the concrete floor decking to provide heating from the bottom up, making it easier to heat some of the building’s high ceilings. In addition to heating elements, the floors also contain an innovative technique known as Bubble Decking, which reduces the building’s carbon footprint by 30 percent by replacing superfluous concrete with recycled plastic balls. The building also contains a 120,000-gallon cistern that collects rainwater to be recycled for landscape irrigation and toilet flushing. With these features and many more, the building seeks to earn a LEED Gold sustainability certification.
The Tepper Quad—and the philosophy it represents—is the latest and most dramatic movement towards the “interconnected campus” model outlined in the Carnegie Mellon University Strategic Plan 2025. For the five speakers at the ribbon-cutting ceremony, one idea remained consistent: collaboration. In his address, university president Farnam Jahanian looked ahead, assuring his audience that the future of 21st-century education “will depend on breaking down disciplinary silos.” Amidst applause he continued, “It will be forged by diverse minds coming together for learning and research.” Though Forbes Avenue separates it from the main campus, it is meant to be a hub for interdisciplinary work, a center of campus life, and what The Piper described as “CMU’s new front door to campus and its window to the world.”
The building is the home of the new Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship, a collection of programs that provide support and education for students, faculty, alumni, and staff to start their own businesses. The center offers coursework and degrees, networking events, incubators, corporate partnerships, and funding opportunities for entrepreneurs. Jim Swartz, the center’s primary benefactor and namesake, has stressed that it’s not just about making Carnegie Mellon the “destination of choice” for people interested in entrepreneurship. “It’s about helping students learn a way of life that’s going to serve them well in the future,” he said in a video about the center.
The Tepper Quadrangle also houses 18 new breakout spaces for students to work and have meetings, as well as the new 600-person capacity Simmons Auditorium. The new largest auditorium on campus, the Simmons Auditorium can also be divided into smaller sections for classes and other programs. The Forbes Avenue entrance features an official Carnegie Mellon University Welcome Center, where visitors can inquire about admissions and learn about the school through a number of interactive installations. “The idea,” said Tepper in his address, “is that we’ll have people commingle from all around campus to share ideas.”
Tepper received a Master of Science in Industrial Administration from Carnegie Mellon in 1982, launching his career in capital investment and specialty trading. He started the hedge fund Appaloosa Management in 1993, which has seen a cumulative gain of over $25 billion. In 2003, he left his first mark on Carnegie Mellon with a $55 million donation to the business school (to rename it after himself), and has since been involved in long-term planning. This most recent $67 million investment in the Quadrangle, also named after him, reflects his determination to enhance the business program at a school traditionally known for its engineering, computer science, policy, and drama programs. The Tepper Quadrangle makes a bold statement of the University’s focus on and investment in the business program. As the ribbons fell on the new atrium floor, they ushered in a new chapter in the Carnegie Mellon story, one centered on business education.

At Carnegie Mellon University, school shuttles are an important if underutilized form of transportation for students, sometimes the only option besides public buses. Whether students live outside of walking distance from campus or just need to take a quick trip to Whole Foods to stock up on groceries, shuttles ferry students from campus hotspots to central areas in Pittsburgh. However, students do not always know much information about the exact location of shuttle stops or what time the shuttles arrive at a particular location.
To address this issue, Carnegie Mellon’s Parking and Transportation Department has partnered with Ride Systems to develop a mobile phone app that can track school shuttles in real time, allowing students to know when and where they can find these shuttles, and thus use them more efficiently.
Ride Systems is an organization whose main product is an app of the same name that, according to its website, provides live maps of vehicle locations, estimated time of arrivals, settings to notify riders when a bus is close to arriving, ridership information, and administrative maps that track information about its own vehicles, among other services.
In an interview with The Tartan, Michael Rees, who works at Ride Systems, gave a sense of the scope of the app’s usage. “Ride Systems has been working with universities from our conception. Our first client was Utah State [University] and they are still a client to this day,” he said.
Ride Systems’ app is also used by a variety of organizations besides universities. Its other clients include airports, municipalities, private companies, hotels, and resorts.
Since the app has rolled out, its benefits are already being felt, including from the point of view of those in charge of the Carnegie Mellon shuttles on the administrative side.
Lieutenant Robert Opferman, who commands the Special Services Division in the university’s police department, called the app “extremely helpful” in an interview with The Tartan. It is now more convenient and efficient for students to ride the shuttle, as they no longer have to stand outside for a long time waiting. In addition, through the notifications feature that the app provides, “[Carnegie Mellon] dispatchers are able to send pushes out to the ridership informing them about cancellations and delays”, Opferman said.
“Making the bus more convenient to ride is one of our main motivators”, said Rees. This convenience can now be enjoyed by Carnegie Mellon students who ride the school shuttle as well. Students who rely on the shuttles will not have to guess at the times of their arrival and perhaps some students will be tempted by the added convenience to give the shuttles a try!

The first Intersect@CMU conference also had the honor of being the first big event held in the shiny new David A. Tepper Quadrangle. The intersection to which the name of the conference refers is presumably the same intersection that the still squeaky clean Tepper Quad represents: “the nexus of technology and business.”
The panelists attracted by the inaugural conference discussed topics that live at the ‘nexus’ President Farnam Jahanian touted, in all likelihood ones that will continue to be discussed in the Tepper Quad as students settle into the academic year. Though the topics were all technology-influenced, the speakers were largely business leaders or business professors with connections to Carnegie Mellon.
The first panel, titled “At the Intersection of Technology and Business: Smart Home, Smart Car, Smart City,” featured Anthony Foxx, who served as Secretary of Transportation under former President Barack Obama, who will begin this year as an ‘executive-in-residence’ at Carnegie Mellon, providing Heinz College and College of Engineering students with his expertise on cities and transportation. The second panel, titled “Designing Intelligence: Shaping AI and Society,” featured Alexander Grey, VP of AI Sciences at IBM who graduated with a Ph.D. in computer science in 2003. The third and final panel in the one day conference was “Decentralizing Trust: Blockchain’s Radical Potential,” which highlighted current and future uses of blockchain.
Though the talks all discussed the uses of new technologies in the business sector, the undercurrent that sometimes went unmentioned was the potential dangers that these technologies represented when optimized for business without considering social repercussions.
This trend was perhaps best represented by the keynote speaker, Jerome Pesenti, VP of AI at Facebook who did research in computer science at Carnegie Mellon while doing mandatory service in the French military. He began with the claim that “AI is at the core of what Facebook does, but it may not be evident.” AI and machine learning algorithms determine most of a Facebook user’s experience, from ordering the news feed to serving the ads that are at the center of Facebook’s revenue model.
He insisted that the - was no longer trying to optimize for maximum engagement, but instead asked the questions “is it making you happy? Is it making you more informed?” Along this vein, he detailed the ways in which Facebook is using algorithms to recognize meaningless clickbait or to crack down on hate speech. He acknowledged the limitations of relying on AI to do these things, referring to Facebook’s failure to remove posts inciting violence against the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar in saying, “Trying to catch hate speech is very difficult. And doing that in Burmese is more difficult.”
He ended his speech with a warning about the AI whose influence he had touted as central to Facebook’s business: “If you don’t pay attention you can reinforce the bias that already exists in society,” though he insisted that “not all bias is bad.”
Pesenti closed this reflection not with a solution to the problem of algorithmic bias but with a plea for people to focus on diversifying the field of AI. “The most important thing we can do to is bring people into the field...who understand these biases, who experience these biases.” This conclusion seemed to reinforce what seemed to be an underlying message to the conference: technology has immense potential in the business sector, but the field has yet to grow and change to meet current and future consequences of this potential.

Hello Students at Carnegie Mellon,
Today I want to take this opportunity to address you directly. Or at least those of you who read The Tartan. I know many of you may brush this column off as inconsequential. But I want to explain to you why that is wrong. The Student Government here at Carnegie Mellon is trying to make a real impact. Our current initiatives are focusing on moderating the add/drop deadline, providing cheaper apparel to students, and managing day to day items like the Dean’s Lists and finals schedule. If any of these issues are remotely important to you, then the Student Government has a direct impact on your experience here at Carnegie Mellon. I’m not saying you must run for a position on Senate or the Executive Branch. I know everyone has their time commitment. But I strongly encourage you to reach out to the representatives in your college and let them know how your experience has been at Carnegie Mellon. If you feel like something needs to be changed, they are the ones who will help instigate that change. If you don’t know who your representatives are, please visit www.cmusenate.org to view a list of senators by college. Everyone on the Senate is looking to make a positive and meaningful impact on campus, and we rely on student feedback to make that change happen. I look forward to hearing about all your suggestions about how to enhance the Carnegie Mellon experience.
Kind Regards,
Shraiy Gupta
Senate Communications Chair

President Donald Trump has not been the greatest supporter of the First Amendment. While running for president, he expressed interest in ‘opening’ up libel laws once he gained the presidency so that he “can sue [writers and sources of ‘fake news’] and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they’re totally protected.” A mere month into his presidency, he threatened the Johnson Amendment, which would have taken a massive stab at the separation of church and state. He has had a history of demonizing the press as the “enemy of the people” and barred journalists from events such as White House briefings. After the North Korea-US Summit, Trump expressed that he wanted his people to treat him as North Koreans treat Kim Jong Un.
Considering the fact that he is a man who is praised by his supporters for “speaking his mind,” he doesn’t appear to want to enforce that same right for the people he should represent.
In response to the protests against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Trump said “I don’t know why they don’t take care of a situation like that. I think it’s embarrassing for the country to allow protesters. You don’t even know what side the protesters are on.”
He appeared to reminisce, saying that “in the old days, we used to throw them out. Today, I guess they just keep screaming.”
Frankly, the topic of protest should not even matter. It is disgraceful that people, regardless of their stance on Trump, the current administration, and Judge Kavanaugh, are not taking strides to defend democracy and one of the major pegs that maintains it: the freedom of speech.
It is disappointing to see the audience that usually screams “freedom of speech!” and “First Amendment” in times such as the controversial Oregon bakery case, which deemed the baker’s wish to discriminate against a gay couple’s request for a wedding cake because of his personal religious beliefs, seems to be ominously silent when our president is trying to chip away at the fundamental tenet that allows democracy.
The First Amendment does not care what your opinion of Trump as a president is or whether you believe private businesses have the right to decide who to serve. Its duty is to make sure that your voice, if you want it to be heard, can be expressed without persecution.
Former President Barack Obama has had his fair share of criticisms before, during, and after his two terms as President of the United States. However, as he pointed out recently in his speech at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, “I complained plenty about Fox News, but I never threatened to shut them down.” It’s quite a contrast to the countless tweets Trump made at “fake news” sources and anyone who doesn’t portray him in the most favorable angle.
Is Trump sending empty threats to create a stir? Quite possibly; if anybody knows how to use the sleight of hand to distract the masses, it’s Trump. Even if he doesn’t completely deny people the right to protest, he is still creating obstructions that discourage and inhibit people from doing so and potentially creating antecedents to ideologies that may later enable censorship.
In the Declaration of Independence, “Freedom of Speech” does not have an asterisk that leads to a microscopic footnote at the end reading “Terms and conditions may apply”. Freedom of speech does not protect just popular speech; it allows all of us to have a voice without the fear of persecution. It allows Colin Kaepernick, as well as other National Football League players, to take a knee for the national anthem. It allows people to  demonstrate their dissent towards the current administration. Are some protests more effective than others? Of course. However, we should not demonize the mere act of protesting.

Like at most schools, traditional college lecturing is a widely-used teaching method at Carnegie Mellon University. I’ve personally taken many courses where all or most of the in-class time is spent listening to the professor lecture. This has been true across a range of subjects, from environmental history to multivariable calculus. 
While I have had the privilege of listening to a few great lecturers, I am often bored by passively sitting in class while the instructor drones on about a topic. It’s difficult to focus, I’m not engaged, and while this (fortunately) has not happened to me yet, I've seen students fall asleep in lectures on many occasions. Sadly, even when a lecturer is well-prepared and has clearly put effort into their PowerPoint slides, I often don’t enjoy the lectures.
You might think that the boredom often accompanying lectures is a necessary price to pay in order to learn the subject material, but this is not the case. In fact, evidence from education research including meta-analyses has shown that lecturing is a less effective teaching method than more active approaches to education. This is especially true for education in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.
So why is lecturing so widespread given its unpleasantness for students and the mountain of evidence against it? I can think of a number of reasons. 
Professors are incentivized to focus more on research than teaching, and therefore might not give as much thought to the effectiveness of their pedagogical methods. It may appear that students are learning things in lectures, when really they are learning from the homework and other active learning components of the courses. There could be a bias toward the status quo, how things were when professors were students, what the professor in the classroom next door is doing, or what our peer institutions are doing. As bad as lecturing is, the people in charge of university accreditation evidently don't mind.
Lecturing feels good for the lecturer, and people might even be interested in becoming a professor in part because they want to lecture. After all, it’s how most professors teach. On the student side, while listening to lectures may be boring, it’s relatively easy and takes little effort. Students may feel like they are learning a lot from lectures, even if they won’t remember the content for long. And lectures can occasionally be entertaining or even inspiring, despite not being good for learning.
Regardless of the reason for its persistence, lecturing needs to be replaced with better teaching methods. But how can this change be enacted? Since the primary way that students communicate feedback about their educational experiences at Carnegie Mellon is through the Faculty/Course Evaluations (FCEs), I propose using this medium to ask for more active learning. 
For the past few semesters, I have based my ratings primarily on the extent to which the courses I took avoided traditional lectures. Professors who lecture get 1 or 2 stars, those who use class discussions or other active learning approaches get 4 or 5 stars, and those who use a mix of both get somewhere in between. 
In addition, I have made sure to mention my opinion on lecturing vs. active learning in the comments section of the evaluations, citing my desire for the use of more effective, enjoyable, and evidence-based teaching methods in the classroom. A few professors request that students fill out mid-semester feedback forms, and I’ve used those to promote my ideas as well.
Some Carnegie Mellon classes, both in the humanities and in STEM subjects, use active learning to great success. For example, last year I took International Development: Theory & Praxis, taught by former Carnegie Mellon post-doctoral fellow Dr. Takiyah Harper-Shipman. It was one of the most transformative and fascinating classes I’ve taken in college. It featured little lecturing, but lots of class participation and active discussion about the readings assigned for homework. It is a model of how readings-based courses should use in-class time.
I’m currently taking Statistical Computing with Professor Ryan Tibshirani. He devotes two out of three classes per week to hands-on R programming labs. The instructor and teaching assistants walk around the classroom while students actively work on the assignments, offering assistance when students are struggling in an unproductive way. Aside from the Monday lectures, the Wednesday and Friday labs are a good approach that can be imitated by any of the numerous Carnegie Mellon courses requiring work on STEM problem sets.
There should be far more active learning at Carnegie Mellon, and far less lecturing. And if enough students express the desire for this in FCEs, maybe there will be.

Cyborgs, the Singularity, the end of the universe, and everything in between—Elon Musk’s rambling, two-and-a-half-hour interview with comedian Joe Rogan on The Rogan Experience left no stone unturned, eased along by a few glasses of whiskey and a few drags of pot.
Unsurprisingly, this interview put Musk under fire, and to make the situation even more dramatic, two of Tesla’s top executives left the company and the stock price tumbled by six percent, as reported by NPR. Needless to say, the public reaction wasn’t a positive one.
But intentionally or not, Musk has the right idea - despite his poor execution.
By no means am I condoning recreational marijuana use, or saying that Musk is setting a good example. Rather, what I am encouraging is for CEOs to become more public in their capacity as influencers and leaders, and Musk is clearly no stranger to public attention.
In case you haven’t noticed, the world has changed in the past 40 years: the economy has become more service based, internet and social media have closed geographic and cultural boundaries, and millennials are gradually overtaking Baby Boomers and Gen Xers. As our society changes, so too do the companies we support; after all, what kind of business wouldn’t want to keep pace with their consumer base?
Successful companies are adaptive ones; they are always reframing their brands through the values of their intended audience, and no one embodies that brand better than the CEO. Take Apple for example: sure, part of Apple’s success was the aesthetic and novel design of their products, but equally important was Steve Jobs’ charisma and image as a brilliant visionary who championed creativity and innovation, someone that consumers felt was inspirational and — more importantly — relatable.
Now, is smoking marijuana and rambling on a podcast inspirational? Probably not. Is Musk trying to appeal solely to young stoners? Also no. But what Musk has inadvertently shown us is his humanity. At the end of the day, he enjoys a stiff drink and a random conversation just as much as the next person. That may seem trivial, but for someone as rarified as Musk, it’s significant. If consumers can identify with a CEO, then it’s a lot easier to identify with their brand, and that means greater sales and profits for the company.
Interviews aren’t the only platform for CEOs to publicize themselves. Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook are all excellent ways to connect with the masses, and it’s evident that public figures are leveraging the power of social media to their benefit. Despite the risks of being embroiled in controversies or scandals that can threaten public relations, it’s imperative now, more than ever, to maintain a positive, popular image that strikes a chord with potential buyers. CEOs who haven’t mastered this either fail to curry favor with their audiences or, worse yet, themselves become memes (looking at you, Zuckerberg).
Even if increased publicity doesn’t benefit the company, it still serves the public interest by holding these individuals accountable for their actions. CEO outreach, in conjunction with news coverage, usually paints an accurate picture of the trajectory and the status of a business venture. This is especially important when you consider the fact that a lot of these companies — Tesla, Facebook, Apple — trade stocks that people have invested their hard-earned money in. These literal stakeholders depend on the efficient management of a company to turn a profit, and so transparency is an absolute necessity.
So, as eccentric and controversial as Musk may be, his recent stunt is emblematic of the digital age, where constant communication and public appearances by executives is normal and even expected. Gone are the days when corporate leaders were nothing more than obscure names and faces on company websites. CEOs are becoming increasingly vocal, strengthening their presence in our daily lives and acting, in part, as the conduits of our consumer culture. If that worries you, it shouldn’t; it’s only natural, and it shows that now, more than ever, our values are being observed and considered. With this increasing symbiosis between company leadership and its respective consumer base, businesses are getting better at delivering the services and products we want.
In the end, the customer is king. Just as they should be.

The quest for a replacement Associate Justice on the Supreme Court continues. After former Justice Anthony Kennedy began his retirement over the past summer, many people feared for the future of democracy and for policies regarding topics such as reproductive rights, freedom of speech, LGBTQ+ rights, and capital punishment. He was the vote that swung the ultimate decision in many cases over the past few decades. Given President Trump's history of picks for officials in Washington, many were not expecting the best.
Brett Kavanaugh, an American judge and President Donald Trump's pick for the Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, recently faced hearings before he could officially fill in the Supreme Court. Even before the hearings, many voices from the left tried to stop Kavanaugh, and understandably so. Before being elected president, Trump claimed he would cut back on abortion, claiming "[we should] be appointing pro-life judges." Kavanaugh recently hit the nail on the coffin when he called birth control "abortion-inducing drugs". Kavanaugh was similarly dodgy in response to other topics such as LGBTQ+ rights, sexual harassment, and executive power.
It's unnerving when uneducated voices hold strong opinions based on inaccuracies and falsehoods (just log on to any political Twitter thread and read the tweets below it); it's another thing to see those voices having an impact on policies that affect thousands of lives.
Even if you give Kavanaugh the benefit of the doubt by saying that his conflation of birth control with abortions was an accident, he is still a questionable pick. Throughout the hearings, he had been caught lying under oath on multiple occasions.
The anonymous writer of a Slate article claimed to have made "some of the stolen memos that Brett Kavanaugh lied to the Senate about." In the early 2000s, Kavanaugh "received confidential memos, letters, and talking points of Democratic staffers stolen by GOP Senate aide Manuel Miranda." Although receiving them is not an impeachable offense, lying under oath is. The Slate article shows Kavanaugh's history of lying about receiving the memos. More recently, Sen. Patrick Leahy, during the current hearing, brought up previously hidden emails where Miranda had asked to see Kavanaugh in person to "give him 'paper' files with 'useful info to map out [Senators Joe] Biden and [Dianne] Feinstein, and others.'" When confronted, Kavanaugh claimed that he did not know that the information provided was done inappropriately and tried to justify himself by claiming it is "common to prepare nominees with material they believed would be asked... That is the coin of the realm." All politicians eventually lie or give misleading information for political gain, but the notable distinction here is that all of this happened while Kavanaugh was under oath. Perjury should immediately disqualify a candidate, but the hearings continued nevertheless.
Kavanaugh highlights a trend that has been continuing in our country: identity politics. It's not new that politicians shift their behavior or platform to gain power, but the seemingly tribalistic view on political parties has definitely been enhanced over the years. Kennedy, although conservative, valued ideals over his political party. This did follow with its fair share of criticism, but his vote — which contrasted the interests of the party he represented — ultimately swung in favor of reproductive rights. Even if it was a slap in the face for his party, Kennedy realized that what was more valuable than any party was the nation that he ultimately represents. Was the Supreme Court perfect with Kennedy? Of course not. However, we lost a bipartisan voice in the Supreme Court who prioritized the future of his country over the future of his party. Now eyeing his vacant seat, we find a man who is a puppet for a party.
Furthermore, regarding Kavanaugh's hearings, I have one question: where are the chants from the people who shouted "lock her up" in response to then-Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her email scandal? Clinton deserved to face consequences for putting national security at stake and for not treating confidential information properly. However, those who chanted "lock her up" appear silent on Kavanaugh. Why does one party's wrongdoing count whereas another party — one that just so happens to align with one's political views — can release a representative and not face consequences?
The question above is hypothetical; this, too, is greatly because of identity politics and its divisive nature. One's respective party is put on a moral pedestal whereas the other is berated. This has been evident in our current President's mentality; despite allegations of then-Senate candidate Roy Moore, Trump had no problem endorsing Moore because of his party affiliation. Many people who supported Trump did so because they prioritized party over ideals. Statements such as "I'd rather be Russian than a Democrat" puts committing treason above being affiliated with a different party.
The left is not exempt from this phenomena either. Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton attempted to degrade those who planned on using their votes for her opposing candidate as a "basket of deplorables", disregarding her own shortcomings as a candidate. Some progressives blasted former President Barack Obama after he criticized identity politics by claiming people on all ends of the political spectrum cannot "out of hand disregard what your opponents have to say from the start...[and] insist that those who aren't like you — because they are white, or because they are male — that somehow there’s no way they can understand what I'm feeling, that somehow they lack standing to speak on certain matters."
Politics has never been a clean topic; there is a good reason we avoid politics in many occasions. However, it is perhaps now more imperative than ever to be vigilant of our dialogue, our mindset, and the future for our democracy. Kavanaugh is a symptom, not the problem, of our current political climate. So is Trump and the swamp that he promised to drain but is instead manifesting. Regardless of political affiliation, we must hold our representatives, our leaders, and each other accountable.

“I don’t cheat to win” Serena declared, her voice shaking with impotent anger and frustration, as she challenged umpire Carlos Ramos’s call that she had received coaching during her US Open Final match against 20-year-old Naomi Osaka.
And in that moment, the fact that she has been repeatedly discriminated by the administration of the game that she now dominates like nobody ever did before flashed by my mind: she had been drug-tested more times than any other player has. She has had her femininity questioned. The catsuit she wore during French Open for medical purposes was banned… the list just goes on. So yes, at that moment, as she faced off with the umpire, I remembered all of this.
For those of you who don’t know what went down in that fateful final, here’s the backstory: in the second game of the second set, Ramos gave Serena a code violation for receiving coaching. However, several other players receive on-court coaching and get away with it. In fact, the perennial bad boy of tennis, Nick Kyrgios, was “encouraged” by umpire Mohamed Lahyani, who was officiating his second round match at the same tournament during the changeover. Regardless, receiving coaching is still a violation of the rules, and Ramos was right in calling it out.
The tricky part is, Serena had apparently not seen her coach give her hand-signals, and took Carlos’ call as an attack of the integrity of her character. She demanded that he apologize for insinuating that she cheated because it was her coach that tried coaching her on-court and she had nothing to do with it.
Thereon, it went downhill.
He handed her a point penalty for breaking her racket, which was, again, a valid call. But then, Ramos decided that when Serena called him a “thief” for taking a point away from her, it qualified for verbal abuse. Since that was her third violation, it cost her a whole game in the final set in a important crucial stage of the match.
Serena was penalized for displaying her anger, something that almost every sports-person does. She was penalized even though several other men had gotten away with saying the same, and sometimes even worse, to umpires. In fact, at one point in the fourth round of the French Open in 2017, Novak Djokovic faced off with Ramos himself, heatedly telling the umpire, “You’re losing your mind.” And all he got was a warning, not a penalty. Furthermore, that was in the fourth round of a Grand Slam tournament. In a Grand Slam final, the stakes are higher and the emotions more volatile. Ramos had the authority and the power to bring the game back into control. But he didn’t.
In the same tournament, there was another display of sexism. French tennis player Alize Cornet realized that she had worn her shirt backwards and changed it, but umpire Christian Rask was given a violation. However, several other male tennis players often take off their shirts on-court and are never punished for it.
I’m not saying that he’s wrong to enforce rules; that is the umpire’s duty. I’m saying it is wrong that Ramos, and several other umpires, enforce rules selectively.
Worse are the reactions of some people online and the headlines in news reports that tagged Serena’s anger as a “meltdown.” Some pontificated that her behavior is a bad example to her daughter. One news article called her “unhinged” and termed her aggressiveness as “boorish” and a disappointing example to all those who considered her a role-model.
But never were some prominent male tennis players such as John McEnroe, who was known for his temper on-court, or Djokovic, who is funny and easy-going until he gets furious, asked to control their anger on court because they’re role-models to many others. Never did sports writers question the kind of example they’re setting to their children through their display of anger.
When men do it, it’s passion. When women do it, it’s hysteria.
Several women are speaking out about their own experiences of workplace discrimination based on their gender and race. As  former professional tennis player and advocate Billie Jean King said, women are taught to be perfect. We are taught to be ladylike, to adhere to society’s rigid rules, and to not show any emotions publicly even when the situation or our profession demand it. Instead, we are taught to just take it and move on. Why? Because speaking up results in backlash.
And that is what is happening to Serena now.
Serena has redefined the limits of what women can achieve in tennis. Yet there are people who constantly regard her achievements with skepticism and who question the legitimacy of her success with sometimes subtle, but more often blatant, racist and sexist remarks. She is the greatest female tennis player of all time, but she still has to fight for respect.
This is a woman who won her record-creating 23rd Grand Slam whilst she was pregnant. This is a woman who had to hear a former male Grand Slam champion mock her unborn child’s skin color. This is a woman who, a year ago, literally, had almost died after giving birth to her daughter, and then staged a triumphant comeback. This is a woman who’s been body-shamed too many times to count.
Women in tennis have faced discrimination. It was only in 1973 that women started receiving equal prize money for winning Grand Slams. In fact, Wimbledon started giving equal prize money only a decade ago. Billie Jean King faced sexism and so has Serena. Sexism exists. And rather than denying it, tennis associations should find ways to eliminate it.
That Saturday night, under the closed roof of the Arthur Ashe stadium, we did not see a “meltdown”. Instead, what we witnessed was the greatest female tennis player having  had enough of being disrespected.
